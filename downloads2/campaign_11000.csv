Image Recognition & Auto-Follow ModeThe BW-Space underwater camera uses artificial intelligence to first discover, then lock its targeting onto, and then automatically follow anyone in the water. BW-Space underwater drone goes autonomous to track divers and produce much smoother video than manual piloting.BW-Space's intelligent tracking mode navigates using algorithms that are much smoother than manual drone piloting, allowing for better camera stabilization as it traverses underwater while allowing the pilot more time to focus capturing their underwater videos.BW Space underwater drone goes autonomous to track scuba divers.When the Intelligent Tracking Mode is enabled, BW-Space's underwater camera uses cutting-edge image recognition technology to identify any person, snorkeler, and/or diver in view. Once enabled, simply point the underwater camera at your target within a distance 0.5 to 7 meters away and a yellow frame will appear on your target indicating that its algorithms have recognized a target to track. Once initiated, Intelligent Tracking Mode will automatically follow that person throughout the water wherever they go without any user piloting control required. Auto-Adjusting Underwater LED LightingThe BW-Space underwater lighting sensors solve the problem most beginners have with too much, too little, or erratic lighting as your drone films at different depths.Auto-adjusting underwater lights removes the complexities of manually adjusting for the best quality photography.When the 'Smart Auto-Adjust Lighting Mode' is enabled, BW-Space's powerful Dual LED Lights automatically adjust anywhere from 0 to 1,380 Lumens to maintain optimal lighting. For example, as the submarine ascends or descends the underwater drone lights will automatically adjust to maintain consistent lighting using its recommended or your custom selected brightness levels:
Descends/Increases — Automatically increase LED light brightness as natural sunlight decreases as you go deeper.

The main risk of any project like this is delays in materials and, subsequently, production. We have been making leather goods for some time now and have learned the importance of sourcing, manufacturing, and meeting our schedule goals. We are confident though that there will be no hiccups or delays that could influence the provided timeframe.
We pride ourselves in providing great customer service and promise to communicate frequently and openly. You can support this project and be confident, that your questions and feedback will be answered.",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Fairy is affordable, easy to fly, and have extensive features that make it ideal for first time navigators.   
With the Fairy, you will get all the amazing images and 1080P FHD aerial videos with ease anywhere, anytime. Turn Fairy into your personal air camera with a single touch thanks to its intuitive remote controller and app. Designed for its portability, Fairy can be folded into the size of a phone. Thanks to its 140g weight, no FAA registration is required, so enjoy its 16mins flying time with a single charge.   
 
The Fairy drone has been designed with a high-performancing camera and a Sony 1/3” (CMOS) sensor to deliver 1080P full HD videos (30 fps) and 8-megapixel images. The camera can be manual tilted down to 60 degrees. With its continuous capture and delay capture mode, Fairy can be your personal autonomous flying photographer! With a single touch you can set Fairy to track you while you’re taking pictures or videos. Just turn on the auto-tracking and put away your phone to enjoy a ‘hands-free’ video shooting experience. Built for easy and smart use, Fairy’s SLAM 3D precise position hovering technology is like having a tripod in the air. Fairy will maintain the altitude that you choose to give you the perfect pictures with all the right angles. All you have to do is place the drone, pick you favorite position, pose, and Fairy will do the rest. To make the flying experience even more fun, Fairy comes with a motion control mode. You can turn your phone into a motion sensing controller to navigate the Fairy. Tilt your phone in any direction and Fairy will follow in real time. *Actual shot by Fairy Drone*Actual video shot by Fairy Drone  
 Check out the prototype review from 3rd party reviewer - Jay DroneTo make your first drone flying experience even easier, we’ve designed the Fairy to return to its home location with a single touch. Just in case Fairy does goes too far, we have integrated a smart function that allows Fairy to go back to its initial starting point if its out of range or if the signal is lost.  Fairy features a dual-band GPS that tracks its exact position and starting point. So, even if you lose it in the clouds, just wait at the starting point and it will be back to you.  Personalize it to your needs and choose between 3 different sensitivity modes: low, medium, and high. Each mode provides a different flying experience: smooth flying to record steady videos, normal flight, or take it to the next level with the high sensitivity mode to make it fly like a race drone. Thanks to its four high speed brushless motors.Despite its size, the Fairy is designed to last longer than other pocket drones in the market.

<div><div>As an angler with over 20 years experience of fishing with professionals, what annoys me the most is not seeing what i am catching beneath the water.</div></div>
<p>We love fishing and we have fished all over the world, yet, none of us really ""sees"" what happens or how fish really takes the bait. We now bring you Anglereye! The smallest Full HD camera that fixes to any fishing line whatever fishing rig you are using. </p>
<p>100% have reported improved fishing skills, increased fish haul and knowledge since using Anglereye, including professional anglers and boatsmen.</p>

<p>We know that a lot of projects face the same problem, Fulfillment! We have started making Anglereye since 2016, and the ONLY REASON WHY WE ARE JUST LAUNCHING THIS PROJECT HERE ON INDIEGOGO IS THAT <u>WE! WANT! IT! TO! BE! READY!</u>, unlike others, we are now as ready as it needs to be, all we need is your help, and we can get our mold ready and start mass production.</p>
<p>Some might wonder, why does our shipping cost more than others? Due to recent regulations on Lithium batteries, every Angerleye will only be shipped via DHL, FEDEX or UPS, so you can be rest assured that you will receive  your Anglereye within a week of dispatch.</p>

<p>Yes, we do have many problems we need to face and to be solved, like shipping products with batteries, we see people charging only $10 for shipping a product with Lithium batteries, so beware of products that contain Lithium batteries with a low shipping cost, because it could take months to get to you if you are half way round the world. With us, every Angerleye will only be shipped via DHL, FEDEX or UPS, so no worries, coz you know we gotcha! </p>
<p>We are teamed with a trading company that is working with an overwhelming amount of well experienced suppliers and factories that have been producing great products such as Robi, R2D2 robot, Millennium Falcon and more. And all that access to different factories have allowed us to solve all sorts problem that we have encountered. From technical, molding and package problems are now an advantage to us.</p>

We love fishing and we have fished all over the world, yet, none of us really ""sees"" what happens or how fish really takes the bait. We now bring you Anglereye! The smallest Full HD camera that fixes to any fishing line whatever fishing rig you are using. 
100% have reported improved fishing skills, increased fish haul and knowledge since using Anglereye, including professional anglers and boatsmen.

 

 

We know that a lot of projects face the same problem, Fulfillment! We have started making Anglereye since 2016, and the ONLY REASON WHY WE ARE JUST LAUNCHING THIS PROJECT HERE ON INDIEGOGO IS THAT WE! WANT! IT! TO! BE! READY!, unlike others, we are now as ready as it needs to be, all we need is your help, and we can get our mold ready and start mass production.
Some might wonder, why does our shipping cost more than others? Due to recent regulations on Lithium batteries, every Angerleye will only be shipped via DHL, FEDEX or UPS, so you can be rest assured that you will receive  your Anglereye within a week of dispatch.

 


 

 



 



Yes, we do have many problems we need to face and to be solved, like shipping products with batteries, we see people charging only $10 for shipping a product with Lithium batteries, so beware of products that contain Lithium batteries with a low shipping cost, because it could take months to get to you if you are half way round the world. With us, every Angerleye will only be shipped via DHL, FEDEX or UPS, so no worries, coz you know we gotcha! 
We are teamed with a trading company that is working with an overwhelming amount of well experienced suppliers and factories that have been producing great products such as Robi, R2D2 robot, Millennium Falcon and more. And all that access to different factories have allowed us to solve all sorts problem that we have encountered. From technical, molding and package problems are now an advantage to us.

Are the clips you are showing real?Yes! All of our clips are filmed with Anglereye, and that is the only reason why we are just launching Anglereye, unlike others, we want you to receive exactly what you backed. What’s more is that we want you to know that we are ready, all R&D that needs to be done is done, only minor upgrades, modifications and quality check before you receive your Anglereye. When will Anglereye be ready?We already have our functional prototype of Anglereye ready and already gone deep sea fishing with so, all we need is your help, with your help, we will be able to start making molds and start mass production once our Indiegogo funding target has been achieved and all of our beloved backers will be enjoying your own Anglereye in less than 3months. How much will Anglereye cost?Suggested retail price would be at around USD$159.99, so be the early bird and get your Anglereye with a super exclusive price. What if there is no/not enough light down the sea?Anglereye has an extra low lux sensor with built-in LEDs, so you won’t have to worry about the light source, even if you are fishing at night. For best video capturing results, convenience and battery saving reasons, Anglereye will automatically switch LEDs on/off according to the surroundings. How do I get to watch the clips I have just recorded?Anglereye has a Wi-Fi connection for you to change settings of your Anglereye, Wi-Fi is on when the Anglereye is turned on, you can watch your actions you’ve just captured, transfer your clips to your mobile device, change your Anglereye settings and even check out the real-time image just to make sure your Anglereye is working. Can I really get the full action of my fishing experience?YES! In order to maximize the fun of your fishing experience, Anglereye is equipped with a 1080p Full HD camera alongside with a built-in microphone which will enhance the joy of video sharing. From a wide range of lenses we have chosen the perfect 120∘wide-angle lens with the least image distortion making sure that you capture all underwater action at its best possible quality. Is Anglereye safe for deep sea fishing?Anglereye is designed to go deep, it has been tested with a 150m waterproof ability with a sturdy Polycarbonate (the same material riot shields are made of) casing ready to withstand 16bars of pressure at 150m down. How big is Anglereye?Anglereye is the world’s smallest fishing camera, while having all the functions you desire, it has a dimension of 26.6*112.13mm. Is the stainless steel wire strong enough for my sea monsters?The 316 stainless steel wire is strong enough to hold 160KG of tension, which is more than a fully grown female bull shark (132KG), but if you are targeting a Great white or a Killer whale, we strongly suggest you leave your Anglereye out for this one. Can I watch real-time actions underwater?Sadly, no! We are unable to get Anglereye to stream real-time footage underwater as today’s technology has not yet found a way for Wi-Fi signals to penetrate through water, but we will keep an close eye to make sure you will get underwater real-time footage as soon as technology allows. Can I use any microSD card for Anglereye?You can use most microSD cards found on the market, but we only support up to Class 10 64G microSD cards at the moment, while similar products only support 32G cards. 64Gs might not sound a lot, but it will get you around 750mins (12.5hrs) of action, so it should be more than enough for your fishing trip. What format does my clips come in?All clips recorded by Anglereye comes in .mov format, which can be played by most devices and software. How long are the clips?For your convenience, we have pre-set your Anglereye to record clips at 3 minute intervals, but if you want your clips a little longer, you can also change the settings of your Anglereye with your mobile APP to set your clips at 3, 5 or 10 minute intervals. Is Anglereye really Full HD?Of course, but if you find Full HD a little too clear or want longer recording time, you are welcome to change the settings of your Anglereye with your mobile APP to set your clip resolutions at 1080p@30fps / 720p@30 fps / WVGA / VGA.  How do I open the camera?You can thread a piece of string or fishing line through small hole on the cap and pull or if you have no other tools beside your hands, by wiggling and pulling the cap will also do the job. How do I close the camera?Push the cap back in and turn the cap a little making sure the cap is securely fasten. How do I connect Anglereye with my mobile APP?Simply turn on Anglereye and Wi-Fi on your mobile phone, choose Anglereye (pre-set name), press connect on the APP and enjoy. What can I do with the mobile APP?You can make a variety of changes to your Anglereye via the mobile APP.

I live outside of United States. Will you ship to my country?</strong><br/>Sure! We’ll ship worldwide so this won't be a problem.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2.what about the ppl who don't have glasses?</strong></p><p>You can use it on sun glasses or just attach it on any other stuff! As a wearable micro camera, there are many ways to use it like tighting it to your pet’s collar or something. Create your own way to use it!</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.Paka takes pics when I blink, yes?I blink 27600 times a day,does it take a pic every time I blink ?</strong></p><p>PaKa would not take pics everytime you blink but only when you are blinking purposely.</p><p> </p><p><strong>4.How paka sense a wink?</strong></p><p>There is a sensor in paka, which can record the winking data of its wearer. After you wear it on,wink purposely for five times to allow it learn your winking habits then it can distinguish the intentional wink from normal physiological wink. Of course we cannot make sure it’s 100% accurate, but our accuracy testing result is 95% above.</p><p> </p><p><strong>5.What if one can not wink ?</strong></p><p>He or she could take photos by touching the side button or using the app. There are three ways to take photos and two ways to film videos.</p><p> </p><p><strong>6.If my eyes are dry and I blink really hard for some reason ,will it take a pic?</strong></p><p>You got me! I guess that’s the time you should take off the glasses and do some eye massage: )</p><p> </p><p><strong>7.How do you know you are taking photos?</strong></p><p>It will make a sound when you are taking a photo. And the led light on paka is lighting too.</p><p> </p><p><strong>8.How long can it work?</strong></p><p>For pics taking, PaKa lasts for 10 hours long. For video shooting it can work 30mins continuously.</p><p> </p><p><strong>9.Does it have focus function?</strong></p><p>There’s no focus function on PaKa. Just like any other sport camera, it’s equipped with a large depth of field lens to make the whole scene clear and need no time to adjust. All sport cameras have no focus function to catch image in the highest speed, including GoPro.</p><p> </p><p><strong>10. Is it able to keep attaching to glasses through severe exercise?</strong></p><p>With the specific way, PaKa can attach to glasses tightly enough to make sure it won’t fall off during your sport time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>11.Which kind of glasses can put PAKA on?</strong></p><p>It’s suitable for almost all glasses as long as your glasses temple isn’t slim like hair.</p><p> </p><p><strong>12．Does it involve privacy violating?</strong></p><p>Our purpose is to make a fasion micro sport camera but not a candid camera. We want it to be as cool as google glass. In fact PaKa will make a sound and flashing light while taking photo and video. You can consider it as a wearable mini GoPro.</p><p> </p><p><strong>13.

Our Team Our group was formed in 2013, and all of our members came from different camera products companies. Before this we’ve  supplied camera products for Apple, SamSung and Nokia , Except that there are the world‘s most professional camera engineers in our team and we own the  test lab by ourselves. Our members are well acquainted with every process of camera research & development and every process of camera production. To provide to our customers with high quality images, we only use the best sensors and lenses in the world. Before PaKa, we've been committing to camera products’ research and development for a long time. Of course, we only focus on fancy ones. Bringing customers different shooting experience is the goal we pursuit all the long way. Our Test LabWith a professional camera test lab, we are going to bring you the best quality images with PaKa! Time Line   CES FairWe participated in the 2017 CES in Las Vegas.  As you might have expected, PaKa was highly praised at the show！ Risks and challengesThe production of PaKa's prototype was done and it passed the test successfully. Now we are working on perfecting the function of the APP, producing the outer case mould and designing the product packaging. Our team has produced many kinds of camera products before PaKa, so that we are very familiar with these process. FOXCONN, the foundry of Apple is going to help us with production and ensure the standard high quality of every single product  .Looking forward to sharing it with all the supporters in this July！ How to use  FAQ1. I live outside of United States. Will you ship to my country?Sure! We’ll ship worldwide so this won't be a problem. 2.what about the ppl who don't have glasses?You can use it on sun glasses or just attach it on any other stuff! As a wearable micro camera, there are many ways to use it like tighting it to your pet’s collar or something. Create your own way to use it! 3.Paka takes pics when I blink, yes?I blink 27600 times a day,does it take a pic every time I blink ?PaKa would not take pics everytime you blink but only when you are blinking purposely. 4.How paka sense a wink?There is a sensor in paka, which can record the winking data of its wearer. After you wear it on,wink purposely for five times to allow it learn your winking habits then it can distinguish the intentional wink from normal physiological wink. Of course we cannot make sure it’s 100% accurate, but our accuracy testing result is 95% above. 5.What if one can not wink ?He or she could take photos by touching the side button or using the app. There are three ways to take photos and two ways to film videos. 6.If my eyes are dry and I blink really hard for some reason ,will it take a pic?You got me! I guess that’s the time you should take off the glasses and do some eye massage: ) 7.How do you know you are taking photos?It will make a sound when you are taking a photo. And the led light on paka is lighting too. 8.How long can it work?For pics taking, PaKa lasts for 10 hours long. For video shooting it can work 30mins continuously. 9.Does it have focus function?There’s no focus function on PaKa. Just like any other sport camera, it’s equipped with a large depth of field lens to make the whole scene clear and need no time to adjust. All sport cameras have no focus function to catch image in the highest speed, including GoPro. 10. Is it able to keep attaching to glasses through severe exercise?With the specific way, PaKa can attach to glasses tightly enough to make sure it won’t fall off during your sport time. 11.Which kind of glasses can put PAKA on?It’s suitable for almost all glasses as long as your glasses temple isn’t slim like hair. 12．Does it involve privacy violating?Our purpose is to make a fasion micro sport camera but not a candid camera. We want it to be as cool as google glass. In fact PaKa will make a sound and flashing light while taking photo and video. You can consider it as a wearable mini GoPro. 13. Is the APP useable now? What’s  the function of it?Of Course! The debugging of the APP is over. You can download PaKa APP on the App store after receiving your PaKa. Connect your PaKa with it and use it to check out the images and videos you take. You can also set the parameter up to share stuff immediately on your SNS accounts.ContactGeneral Enquiry & Support Help: pakacamera@gmail.comPress and Sample Review: balance@a-electron.comFollow us",23.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Are you offering a warranty on Alpha 3?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are offering a <strong>1-Year Warranty</strong>. Warranty is only for exchange of a defective unit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can I buy more than 1 units or more batteries, is there extra shipping cost? </strong></p>
<p>You can simply place muntiple orders, all the perks are <strong>FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE</strong>, so there is no extra shipping cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><a name=""tech"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technical</a></strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>What is the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS, what can I do with this feature?</strong></strong></p>
<p>For sports and action videos, 60Frame Per Second videos are much smoother, and you can get 2x slow motion video with the footage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Stacked and DOL HDR, why the Alpha3's sensor IMX577 is better than GoPro's IMX277 and DJI Osmo Action's IMX377?</strong></p>
<p>IMX577 is Sony's new generation Exmor RS Cmos sensor, Exmor R IMX277 &amp; 377 are old sensors which are not stacked and there is no DOL HDR.<br/><strong>* Stacked: </strong>Thanks to the stacked structure and quickly buffering DRAM chip, the new Exmor RS CMOS sensor realizes over 5x faster readout speed than conventional models.</p>
<p><strong>* DOL HDR: </strong>Digital Over-Lap High Dynamic Range technology, delivers the data from three exposures on a line-by-line basis rather than frame by frame, resulting in improved picture quality, especially under poor light conditions, compared to common HDR.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Alpha3 is more advanced than GoPro 7 and DJI Action?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mokacam α3:</strong> <strong>H22+IMX577.</strong> Next Generation <strong>DOL HDR at all resolutions</strong> up to 4K 60fps video, <strong>HDR video can be used with electronic stabilization</strong> simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>GoPro: IMX277. HDR </strong>on GoPro Hero7 Black is <strong>only available on photo mode. </strong>Click <strong><a href=""https://gopro.com/help/articles/question_answer/what-is-hdr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a> </strong>to learn more about <strong>the limitations</strong> of GoPro's HDR feature on their website.</p>
<p><strong>DJI:</strong> <strong>H2+IMX377. HDR</strong> on DJI Osmo Action can not be used with stabilization(RockSteady) simultaneously. Click <strong><a href=""https://www.dji.com/osmo-action/info#specs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></strong> to confirm it in the FAQ-Camera-8 on DJI website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How is image stabilization done? Is there a gyro sensor, or is part of video frame cut off via EIS?</strong></p>
<p>The image stabilization is provided by both gyro sensor and the image processor to cut part of the frames, it is called EIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Gopro have their Hypersmooth which is pretty good. Osmo Action has Rocksteady which appears better again. Where would you place the image stabilization of the Alpha 3 compared to these other two cameras please?</strong></p>
<p>GoPro/Osmo Action, no matter what name they call it, the stabilization is Electronic Image Stabilization, which relies on the imager processor to cut the edge of the original image that the sensor gets during the filming. So the computing power is a key to get better performance. As you can see in the campaign page, the 1.2GHz Quad-Core H22 is industry leading, even more powerful than 1.0Ghz H2 on Osmo Action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Regarding HDR, GoPro Hero 7 Black only supports HDR in photo mode, DJI Osmo Action's HDR video conflicts with their stabilization. How about Alpha 3? Can we get HDR video with stabilization?</strong></p>
<p>Alpha3's HDR is available for all video resolutions and there is no conflict with stabilization. So you can get HDR video and stabilization simultaneously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the maximum bitrate? (GoPro 78 Mbit/s, DJI Osmo 100 Mbit/s)</strong></p>
<p>90Mbps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there touch lock to prevent accidentally operation?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>I have a back-up battery for 1st Gen. Mokacam or Alpha S. Does it match Alpha 3?</strong></strong></p>
<p>Sorry, but those batteries won't fit Alpha 3, however, we managed to lower the battery price and it's all <strong>FREE SHIPPING</strong> if you have an existing camera order.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>What's the video recording duration for 1080P 60FPS and 64 Gig of memory?</strong></strong></p>
<p>At 60FPS, 64 Gigs will record 6 hours of footage. At 30FPS, 64 Gigs will record 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>What is the focus range?</strong></strong></p>
<p>The focus range is 15cm - 400cm</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the new App of Alpha S also work for 1st Gen. Mokacam, Snap or Alpha S?</strong></p>
<p>The 1st Gen Mokacam and Snap share the same App which is called <strong>""Mokacam Camera""</strong> in the App Store. Alpha S and Alpha 3 share the same App since they both featured the Ambarella image processor.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>

GeneralTechnicalPayment and Shipping 
 

General
 


Are you offering a warranty on Alpha 3?
Yes, we are offering a 1-Year Warranty. Warranty is only for exchange of a defective unit.

Technical
 
What is the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS, what can I do with this feature?
For sports and action videos, 60Frame Per Second videos are much smoother, and you can get 2x slow motion video with the footage.
 
What is Stacked and DOL HDR, why the Alpha3's sensor IMX577 is better than GoPro's IMX277 and DJI Osmo Action's IMX377?
IMX577 is Sony's new generation Exmor RS Cmos sensor, Exmor R IMX277 & 377 are old sensors which are not stacked and there is no DOL HDR.* Stacked: Thanks to the stacked structure and quickly buffering DRAM chip, the new Exmor RS CMOS sensor realizes over 5x faster readout speed than conventional models.
* DOL HDR: Digital Over-Lap High Dynamic Range technology, delivers the data from three exposures on a line-by-line basis rather than frame by frame, resulting in improved picture quality, especially under poor light conditions, compared to common HDR.
 
Why Alpha3 is more advanced than GoPro 7 and DJI Action?
Mokacam α3: H22+IMX577. Next Generation DOL HDR at all resolutions up to 4K 60fps video, HDR video can be used with electronic stabilization simultaneously.
GoPro: IMX277. HDR on GoPro Hero7 Black is only available on photo mode. Click HERE to learn more about the limitations of GoPro's HDR feature on their website.
DJI: H2+IMX377. HDR on DJI Osmo Action can not be used with stabilization(RockSteady) simultaneously. Click HERE to confirm it in the FAQ-Camera-8 on DJI website.
 
How is image stabilization done? Is there a gyro sensor, or is part of video frame cut off via EIS?
The image stabilization is provided by both gyro sensor and the image processor to cut part of the frames, it is called EIS.
 
Gopro have their Hypersmooth which is pretty good. Osmo Action has Rocksteady which appears better again. Where would you place the image stabilization of the Alpha 3 compared to these other two cameras please?
GoPro/Osmo Action, no matter what name they call it, the stabilization is Electronic Image Stabilization, which relies on the imager processor to cut the edge of the original image that the sensor gets during the filming. So the computing power is a key to get better performance. As you can see in the campaign page, the 1.2GHz Quad-Core H22 is industry leading, even more powerful than 1.0Ghz H2 on Osmo Action.
 
Regarding HDR, GoPro Hero 7 Black only supports HDR in photo mode, DJI Osmo Action's HDR video conflicts with their stabilization. How about Alpha 3? Can we get HDR video with stabilization?
Alpha3's HDR is available for all video resolutions and there is no conflict with stabilization. So you can get HDR video and stabilization simultaneously.
 
What is the maximum bitrate? (GoPro 78 Mbit/s, DJI Osmo 100 Mbit/s)
90Mbps.
 
Is there touch lock to prevent accidentally operation?
Yes.

What's the video recording duration for 1080P 60FPS and 64 Gig of memory?
At 60FPS, 64 Gigs will record 6 hours of footage. At 30FPS, 64 Gigs will record 12 hours.
 
What is the focus range?
The focus range is 15cm - 400cm
 
Will there be an Android App?
Yes, there is an Android and iOS APP. The APPs are ready for operation and will be released before the shipping.
 
Will the new App of Alpha S also work for 1st Gen. Mokacam, Snap or Alpha S?
The 1st Gen Mokacam and Snap share the same App which is called ""Mokacam Camera"" in the App Store. Alpha S and Alpha 3 share the same App since they both featured the Ambarella image processor.

<b>Risks and Challenges</b><br/>
</div><div>
<p>    There are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Fortunately, we have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners that will help us bring SHOCKWAVE to your doorstep.</p>
<p>    Of course, there are still risks associated with producing the PCB board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.</p>
<p>    The other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the SHOCKWAVE Camera. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that SHOCKWAVE arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.</p>

About the antennas    There are two external 4G antennas on the prototype hardware 1.0 and 2.0 version, we have made 10 cameras to test the 4G signal strength. Then we put the 4G antennas into the camera on the mass-production hardware 1.0 and 2.0 version, so all you get is the mass-production hardware 2.0 version. Connect SHOCKWAVE to WiFi router    Here is a video clip to show how to use the camera buttons to connect to a new WiFi router, including scanning AP's SSID and setting the password.Connect SHOCKWAVE to 4G network    Here is a video clip to show how to use the camera buttons to connect to 4G network, the OLED will display the 4G operator, ip and siganl strength.Born history    There are some pictures in the Gallery to show the born history of the camera.FAQ1. Does the SHOCKWAVE camera need a SIM card for 4G broadcasting ?    Yes, it requires a normal Nano-SIM card just as the SIM card used by iPhone.2. Is there any fee on the cloud service and app software ?    The cloud service and app software is free for all bakers. the cloud bandwidth and performance will increase as the fund grows.3. Which 4G band will be supported by SHOCKWAVE camera ?    The SHOCKWAVE can be used all over the world. we provide two versions , one is for Japan and America users which can support more 4G bands, the other one is for world-wide users which can also be used in Japan and America. 
Risks and Challenges

    There are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Fortunately, we have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners that will help us bring SHOCKWAVE to your doorstep.
    Of course, there are still risks associated with producing the PCB board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.
    The other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the SHOCKWAVE Camera. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that SHOCKWAVE arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.",16.0,2,"1 Campaign

WHAT WE NEEDWe're shooting a wedding on April 16th 2016 in Philadelphia for an amazing couple and need the funds for travel expenses as well as hiring a second photographer. The funds will also help us provide the couple with high-end wedding albums & a site where they can download their files for free.-
Sarah and Patrick are both Captains in the Army.
-
Sarah is an ICU nurse whose assignment was to Walter Reed National Military Center, the first stop for the wounded warriors following stabilization in Germany. While assigned to Walter Reed, Sarah dealt first hand with treating severely wounded soldiers who now live a completely different life then they had before they deployed. What we fine so amazing about Sarah is that though she is faced with an overwhelming sense of grief and internalized pain, she uses her energy to fuel her ability to care for and help mend soldiers most in need of care. Faced with the pending deployment for her fiancée it is hard for her not to imagine and worry that something like that could happen to Pat. 




Patrick is scheduled to deploy for his third time.  His first tour was for a year - his second was for 6 months - both were in the Mid-East.  Due to the sensitive nature of his position, we can't tell you in detail the peril he's faced, suffice to say he's a true hero. What we can tell you is - unless you have a loved one whose been deployed, it's impossible to truly understand the stress that these young couples are under.  They can go weeks without contact and human nature being what it is - it's a daily struggle for them to keep the fear of the worst from taking over, especially at night. Since starting The WWP we've seen first hand what these couples go through and we're humbled by their sacrifices, grace and strength.



All donations are tax deductible and truly help us continue to offer unique experiences to each couple.
We understand that not all people are in the position to make cash donations. We hope that you will forward our information to friends and family though to help us get the word out - so we can continue to serve those who put their lives on the line for us. 




We have some fun donation PERKS: The Warrior Wedding Project tote bag and a wide array of photos to choose from at http://gilcope.wix.com/wwp-go-fund",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>Eclipse Rovers fill the gap between drones and traditional camera equipment.</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Eclipse Rovers are radio controlled unmanned mobile ground systems also known as 
UGS, that not only can be operated on the ground, but on on pipes, 
cables and other rigid shapes and surfaces. <br/></p>
<p>Eclipse Rovers give you the ability to acquire never before available moving shots
 and do it from places and in ways you may have never before thought
 possible. <br/>They’re designed to run on four tires and have a suspension system with oil filled shocks. This provides an exceptionally stable platform for capturing beautiful rolling shots.With an Eclipse Rover you can put your equipment in places where you don’t want to be seen, you don’t want to go, or are unsafe for you to be in.  Like when doing structure inspections or documenting hazards. </p>

When your done running on the ground the Eclipse Wheel allows you to operate your Eclipse Rover on cables in obstructed environments that just wouldn’t be feasible with any other device. When your done operating on cables outside, you can move your equipment inside, and with our aluminum truss system, safely operate your equipment over and around people and things.<br/><br/><h3><b>Operating on Cables</b></h3>

The Eclipse Wheel is designed so it can be operated on inch and a quarter pipes which can be easily found at most hardware stores or fencing suppliers.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Born out of  ""FRUSTRATION""</h2>

I've been using camera equipment for over forty years and have watched with amazement at the changes. One of the most transforming technologies has been the advancements in UAS (drones) or as I like call them, ""Flying Cameras"". They are great tools for capturing aerial shots but as you know, there are a lot of places and situations where they are just not an appropriate choice. So when I found myself needing to capture moving shots but couldn't use my flying camera I had to revert to traditional equipment like sliders, dollies, and single cable set ups. I found myself constantly frustrated with how specialized the equipment was. That frustration was what led me to the idea of developing the Eclipse Rovers and the invention of the Eclipse Wheel.<br/><h3>

<b>Where KIOO is going next.</b>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>This November we are focusing our lens on gender equality. In partnership with <b>She’s the First</b> &amp; <b>Shanti Bhavan School</b> in Baliganapalli,
India we will host a 10-day workshop with young girls and boys from the Dalit caste (also known
as the Untouchables). Girls will learn photographic techniques the first week. During the second week, boys will join the workshop to learn photography from a
special group of newly-minted teachers – the girls.</p>
<p>This unique journey ensures that both girls and boys experience the rewards of an arts
education. Girls develop valuable leadership &amp; presentation skills along
with the confidence to become active agents of change in their own lives &amp;
communities. Boys understand the value &amp; worth of girls in their community
by learning a new skill through them. At the end of the 2 weeks, a gallery show
exhibiting the students’ work presents the local community with the opportunity to celebrate the creativity blossoming from budding photographers. </p>
<p>All the camera &amp; printing equipment we bring to India remains at the school. Our goal is for our young graduates to<span> continue teaching &amp; learning photography long after the
workshop is over.</span></p>

We teach photography
to children from communities with limited access to creative resources. Our nonprofit helps young girls and boys develop self-confidence & discover self-expression. We put cameras in the hands of young people who learn to visually tell stories about who they are & how they see the world. We have previously worked
with restaveks (child slaves) in
Gressier, Haiti & students living in Nairobi, Kenya's Lenana slum. The moments they capture take our breath away.

These photographs were taken by students in our January 2014 Kenya workshop.

  
Where KIOO is going next.
 
This November we are focusing our lens on gender equality. In partnership with She’s the First & Shanti Bhavan School in Baliganapalli,
India we will host a 10-day workshop with young girls and boys from the Dalit caste (also known
as the Untouchables). Girls will learn photographic techniques the first week. During the second week, boys will join the workshop to learn photography from a
special group of newly-minted teachers – the girls.
This unique journey ensures that both girls and boys experience the rewards of an arts
education. Girls develop valuable leadership & presentation skills along
with the confidence to become active agents of change in their own lives &
communities. Boys understand the value & worth of girls in their community
by learning a new skill through them. At the end of the 2 weeks, a gallery show
exhibiting the students’ work presents the local community with the opportunity to celebrate the creativity blossoming from budding photographers. 
All the camera & printing equipment we bring to India remains at the school. Our goal is for our young graduates to continue teaching & learning photography long after the
workshop is over.

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Trail Ridge Technologies was founded in 2008 by Mitch and Bob, two veteran inventors from Hewlett-Packard Company who had successful careers developing and bringing multiple quality HP products to market.  With over 40 granted patents between the two of them, Bob and Mitch have a proven record of innovation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472059250/TRTLogo1sm_spefm8.png"" src="""" style=""width: 221px;height: 97px;""/></p>
<p>TRT is a small company committed to making technology simple for our customers, and our QuickVu™ Wireless Backup Camera systems do just that.  Instead of sweating the installation process of drilling holes in your vehicle and splicing into its electrical system (or paying technicians to do so), our customers can install QuickVu™ in minutes with no special tools, no risk to the vehicle, and no expensive shop bills.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Are We Passionate About Backup Cameras?</h3>When  a teenager, Bob was a passenger in a car that was involved in a back-over accident.  In seconds, an unseen two-year-old girl ended up under the rear wheel of a station wagon.  While the injuries she sustained were not life threatening, the vision of gravel embedded in the tiny girl's legs persists in Bob's memories.  We hope to help all families avoid such tragedies in the future.<p> </p>
<p>        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472060708/QV100a_nyp9r3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>Five years ago we introduced the first truly wireless general purpose after-market rear view camera system for cars and small trucks. This innovation made it possible for the average car owner to upgrade to a luxury, rear view option without major expense, effort, or risk to vehicle warranties. And sad experience shows how important enhanced rear visibility really is.  Each year, thousands of children fall victim to back-over accidents and millions of dollars of property damage are incurred when drivers back into shopping carts, mailboxes, other vehicles, and more.  Studies have shown that drivers using a rear view camera are less likely to have accidents when backing up.<span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472067139/TeenDriver2_c1cvdc.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/>     <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472081895/TinaHitchsm1_yrht3z.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/>     <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472067201/Seniors1_gtajxf.png"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/> </p>
<p>Now virtually every family can protect loved ones and property with enhanced rear view capabilities.  Young drivers experience increased confidence when backing up. Aging drivers with stiffening necks and shoulders benefit from the added convenience a backup camera provides.  And anyone who hitches a trailer, for the occasional boating trip or for the daily needs of the tradesman, can streamline the process with a QuickVu™ camera.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Are We Doing Now?</h3>While several hundred QuickVu™ owners have been enjoying the safety and convenience afforded them by this breakthrough product, we have been working on making it even better.  Being the first and the best wasn't good enough—we knew we could delight our customers even more.  We are now ready to launch the new, improved, all-digital Quickvu™ Digital wireless backup camera system.<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Our Current Status</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Prototypes Are Complete and Testing Passed</span></p>
<p>While we have been anxious to release our new design (and many customers have been anxiously waiting for it to be ready), we have taken the time to work out the kinks, make it right, and keep costs down.  We have completed the design and testing of prototypes and are readying a pilot production run. </p>
<h3>The Factory Is Preparing for Production</h3>Our testing has surpassed even our best expectations, and we are thrilled to be ready to start volume production.  The factory has produced several prototypes and is now gearing up for a pilot production run of several hundred units. Thereafter, the factory should be prepared to produce thousands of units per month.<h2> </h2>
<h2>How You Can Help</h2>Did we mention that we are a small company?  We chose to fund development ourselves and so have had to manage our resources and expenditures carefully. When you purchase one of our perks, you help us pay for the initial production run in advance, helping us manage our cash flow.  You can help in a number of ways.<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking  pre-orders to allow us to pay for the pilot production run. If you are willing to wait a brief period for delivery after ordering now, we can raise cash to pay for the first run.  Of course, we will reward you with a discount for helping us out.</li>
<li>If you already have a rear view camera in your vehicle, but you want to see a simple, low-cost rear view upgrade on the market to protect lives and property, your generous contribution will help us fund the production and keep Quickvu™ Digital affordable.</li>
<li>Millions of drivers need a backup camera, but few of them have heard of QuickVu™.  You can spread the word to family, friends, co-workers, associates, PTAs, soccer clubs, drama and dance troupes, landscapers, handymen, and everyone who may benefit from this innovation.  Send emails, share on social media, and use the telephone.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
<p>We need funds to pay for the initial production run.  And we need to build awareness of this great product that will allow every driver to have the safety and convenience of a rearview camera.</p>
<p>Our perks are designed to give you a low priced opportunity to obtain a backup camera that can go from box to installed in minutes. Or, if you and all your loved ones already have a backup camera, our perks provide you the opportunity to make sure this product is available to all families by contribution funds.</p>
<p>This project is important to us, and we will proceed with production, even if we don't reach our entire goal.  Meeting our funding goal will help us make Quickvu™ Digital available even sooner.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your help with our project will ensure that the new Quickvu™ Digital wireless backup camera becomes available for all families and drivers. It's possible that the life or property you save will belong to someone dear to you.</p>
<p>We have been selling QuickVu™ for several years, so we know the need and interest is great.  We have been honored to receive high praise from our customers, both for the product we deliver and for the customer care we provide.  We are anxious to provide even greater value to the customers we serve.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have tried to take on all the risks before offering this project to you.  We have already designed, prototyped, and tested the new model.  The new product has passed FCC testing, functionality testing, testing for waterproofness, and much more.  It is ready to be built.</p>
<p>We have also begun lining up volume customers who have long anticipated this product, so we are confident of enduring success.</p>
<p>The remaining challenge is to get the factory geared up for production.  We expect this to go quickly, but minor hitches may cause some delays. This is why we need customers willing to order now and wait a few weeks for delivery.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Spread the Word!</h3>

Who Are We?
 
Trail Ridge Technologies was founded in 2008 by Mitch and Bob, two veteran inventors from Hewlett-Packard Company who had successful careers developing and bringing multiple quality HP products to market.  With over 40 granted patents between the two of them, Bob and Mitch have a proven record of innovation.  
 
 
 
                                            
TRT is a small company committed to making technology simple for our customers, and our QuickVu™ Wireless Backup Camera systems do just that.  Instead of sweating the installation process of drilling holes in your vehicle and splicing into its electrical system (or paying technicians to do so), our customers can install QuickVu™ in minutes with no special tools, no risk to the vehicle, and no expensive shop bills.  
 
Why Are We Passionate About Backup Cameras?When  a teenager, Bob was a passenger in a car that was involved in a back-over accident.  In seconds, an unseen two-year-old girl ended up under the rear wheel of a station wagon.  While the injuries she sustained were not life threatening, the vision of gravel embedded in the tiny girl's legs persists in Bob's memories.  We hope to help all families avoid such tragedies in the future. 
        


 
Five years ago we introduced the first truly wireless general purpose after-market rear view camera system for cars and small trucks. This innovation made it possible for the average car owner to upgrade to a luxury, rear view option without major expense, effort, or risk to vehicle warranties. And sad experience shows how important enhanced rear visibility really is.  Each year, thousands of children fall victim to back-over accidents and millions of dollars of property damage are incurred when drivers back into shopping carts, mailboxes, other vehicles, and more.  Studies have shown that drivers using a rear view camera are less likely to have accidents when backing up.  
             
Now virtually every family can protect loved ones and property with enhanced rear view capabilities.  Young drivers experience increased confidence when backing up. Aging drivers with stiffening necks and shoulders benefit from the added convenience a backup camera provides.  And anyone who hitches a trailer, for the occasional boating trip or for the daily needs of the tradesman, can streamline the process with a QuickVu™ camera.
 
What Are We Doing Now?While several hundred QuickVu™ owners have been enjoying the safety and convenience afforded them by this breakthrough product, we have been working on making it even better.  Being the first and the best wasn't good enough—we knew we could delight our customers even more.  We are now ready to launch the new, improved, all-digital Quickvu™ Digital wireless backup camera system. 
 
 
Our Current Status
 
Prototypes Are Complete and Testing Passed
While we have been anxious to release our new design (and many customers have been anxiously waiting for it to be ready), we have taken the time to work out the kinks, make it right, and keep costs down.  We have completed the design and testing of prototypes and are readying a pilot production run. 
The Factory Is Preparing for ProductionOur testing has surpassed even our best expectations, and we are thrilled to be ready to start volume production.  The factory has produced several prototypes and is now gearing up for a pilot production run of several hundred units. Thereafter, the factory should be prepared to produce thousands of units per month. 
How You Can HelpDid we mention that we are a small company?  We chose to fund development ourselves and so have had to manage our resources and expenditures carefully. When you purchase one of our perks, you help us pay for the initial production run in advance, helping us manage our cash flow.  You can help in a number of ways. 
 

We are seeking  pre-orders to allow us to pay for the pilot production run. If you are willing to wait a brief period for delivery after ordering now, we can raise cash to pay for the first run.  Of course, we will reward you with a discount for helping us out.
If you already have a rear view camera in your vehicle, but you want to see a simple, low-cost rear view upgrade on the market to protect lives and property, your generous contribution will help us fund the production and keep Quickvu™ Digital affordable.
Millions of drivers need a backup camera, but few of them have heard of QuickVu™.  You can spread the word to family, friends, co-workers, associates, PTAs, soccer clubs, drama and dance troupes, landscapers, handymen, and everyone who may benefit from this innovation.  Send emails, share on social media, and use the telephone.

 
What We Need & What You Get
We need funds to pay for the initial production run.  And we need to build awareness of this great product that will allow every driver to have the safety and convenience of a rearview camera.
Our perks are designed to give you a low priced opportunity to obtain a backup camera that can go from box to installed in minutes. Or, if you and all your loved ones already have a backup camera, our perks provide you the opportunity to make sure this product is available to all families by contribution funds.
This project is important to us, and we will proceed with production, even if we don't reach our entire goal.  Meeting our funding goal will help us make Quickvu™ Digital available even sooner.
 
 
The Impact
Your help with our project will ensure that the new Quickvu™ Digital wireless backup camera becomes available for all families and drivers. It's possible that the life or property you save will belong to someone dear to you.
We have been selling QuickVu™ for several years, so we know the need and interest is great.  We have been honored to receive high praise from our customers, both for the product we deliver and for the customer care we provide.  We are anxious to provide even greater value to the customers we serve.
 
 
Risks & Challenges
We have tried to take on all the risks before offering this project to you.  We have already designed, prototyped, and tested the new model.  The new product has passed FCC testing, functionality testing, testing for waterproofness, and much more.  It is ready to be built.
We have also begun lining up volume customers who have long anticipated this product, so we are confident of enduring success.
The remaining challenge is to get the factory geared up for production.  We expect this to go quickly, but minor hitches may cause some delays. This is why we need customers willing to order now and wait a few weeks for delivery.
 
 
Spread the Word!
There are millions of drivers in the US alone driving vehicles without adequate rear visibility. How many of your friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers would be thrilled to know how easily they can upgrade their car or truck? You can let people know about Quickvu™ Digital via

<p>Have you ever wanted to capture life’s experiences with a
POV (point of view) /action camera and when you go to look at the footage you’ve
captured, you discover the camera wasn’t even pointing in the right direction? Now
you've missed out on capturing that moment, and life doesn’t have too many replay
opportunities.  We’re sure it’s happened
to you because it’s happened to us one too many times. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433538104/xrcba7p5wgyjncviazzh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434659803/lvfapxebm5j2beljpxby.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433907499/zpweebxftqvqt1gqyi5a.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/><h3><b>The Watch/Live-View Remote</b></h3>We’re Xplore and we have a solution for this very problem.  Xplore cameras are high quality, high definition POV/action
cameras that act and operate like the “other guys” but every Xplore camera comes
with a watch that also acts as a live-view remote. 
It’s Awesome!  You can see what
your camera is seeing right from your wrist. 
You can actually start and stop recording and snap pictures with a quick push of a button.  Oh yeah, and you can do this for up to six
cameras from a single watch/remote.            <div>

 priced cameras.  <b>Every Xplore camera comes packaged with a watch/remote. </b><br/><br/>

<br/><h3>The Xplore Camera <br/>
</h3>The Xplore camera is a high definition action/POV camera that shoots 1080p60fps along with many other settings to fit your needs.  It has multiple settings for still photography with a 16MP image, photo bursts (7 shots per second), time-lapsed video and photos and many others.  Xplore cameras have 1GB internal memory for those moments you just need to capture a quick video or picture but you forgot your MicroSD card.  Xplore has built-in WiFi to wirelessly connect your camera to your mobile device and manage your images and videos remotely.  To see a full list of camera specs, visit the <a href=""http://www.xplorevideo.com/portfolio/items/the-camera/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Xplore Video site</a>.</div><div>

<h3>Mounts &amp; Accessories</h3>
<p>All Xplore cameras come with a set of mounts and attachments that work exclusively with our designs.  Our mount designs are exclusive to Xplore and do not work with mounts used by other POV/action camera manufacturers.  However, we understand that a lot of you may already have selfie sticks, head/chest mounts or other mounts from a previous camera.  We will provide a universal adapter that makes all Xplore mounts compatible with GoPro mounts and accessories.  You can see a list of available Xplore mounts and accessories <a href=""http://www.xplorevideo.com/portfolio/items/gallery-slideshow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.<br/></p>

<h3>Our Goal and Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Xplore is working with its overseas manufacturing partner to
make this product available to everyone in the United States.  We need your help in bringing this
product to the masses and to do it for a price that is cheaper than the “other
guys”.  <br/></p>
<p>We are just like you, technology and adventure geeks wrapped
into one, and we are always looking for the next adventure but never wanting to
leave our gadgets at home.  We love the idea of preserving memories in the format of .mp4s and .jpegs.  Plus, now you won't miss out on those priceless moments by not knowing where your camera is pointing.
</p>
<p>With your help, we can enhance the design of the watch/remote, create a new
Apple Watch app, and get Xplore cameras into the hands of users like you for a price that everyone can afford.  <br/></p>
<p>Below are some design ideas we have been working on for a new watch/remote.</p>

</div></div>","Why Xplore Cameras?  
Have you ever wanted to capture life’s experiences with a
POV (point of view) /action camera and when you go to look at the footage you’ve
captured, you discover the camera wasn’t even pointing in the right direction? Now
you've missed out on capturing that moment, and life doesn’t have too many replay
opportunities.  We’re sure it’s happened
to you because it’s happened to us one too many times. The Watch/Live-View RemoteWe’re Xplore and we have a solution for this very problem.  Xplore cameras are high quality, high definition POV/action
cameras that act and operate like the “other guys” but every Xplore camera comes
with a watch that also acts as a live-view remote. 
It’s Awesome!  You can see what
your camera is seeing right from your wrist. 
You can actually start and stop recording and snap pictures with a quick push of a button.  Oh yeah, and you can do this for up to six
cameras from a single watch/remote.            
The Xplore live view watch remote has a 1-3/8"" LED screen that is completely water proof up to 60 meters.  It is complete with full watch functions, such as standard and military time settings, change colors of digits, timers, stop watch, and alarms as well as being your controller to manage all your filming.  Not only is it completely functional as a day-to-day watch, but it has a style that allows you to wear it wherever you go.  You get all this AND you don't have to pay an extra $100+ dollars on top of those already over
 priced cameras.  Every Xplore camera comes packaged with a watch/remote. 

The Xplore Camera 
The Xplore camera is a high definition action/POV camera that shoots 1080p60fps along with many other settings to fit your needs.  It has multiple settings for still photography with a 16MP image, photo bursts (7 shots per second), time-lapsed video and photos and many others.  Xplore cameras have 1GB internal memory for those moments you just need to capture a quick video or picture but you forgot your MicroSD card.  Xplore has built-in WiFi to wirelessly connect your camera to your mobile device and manage your images and videos remotely.  To see a full list of camera specs, visit the Xplore Video site.





The App    

At Xplore, we use the Action Cam! app that is available for both iOS and Android smartphones and tablets.  The app allows you to connect through private WiFi to view your cameras live feed as well as manage your files.  You can preview and set up your camera shots with your device as well as download and manage files directly. You can even trim the videos on your device and immediately share them with your friends, fans and family through social networks.
                                
Mounts & Accessories
All Xplore cameras come with a set of mounts and attachments that work exclusively with our designs.  Our mount designs are exclusive to Xplore and do not work with mounts used by other POV/action camera manufacturers.  However, we understand that a lot of you may already have selfie sticks, head/chest mounts or other mounts from a previous camera.  We will provide a universal adapter that makes all Xplore mounts compatible with GoPro mounts and accessories.  You can see a list of available Xplore mounts and accessories here.

                     
Our Goal and Why We Need Your Help



Xplore is working with its overseas manufacturing partner to
make this product available to everyone in the United States.  We need your help in bringing this
product to the masses and to do it for a price that is cheaper than the “other
guys”.  
We are just like you, technology and adventure geeks wrapped
into one, and we are always looking for the next adventure but never wanting to
leave our gadgets at home.  We love the idea of preserving memories in the format of .mp4s and .jpegs.  Plus, now you won't miss out on those priceless moments by not knowing where your camera is pointing.

With your help, we can enhance the design of the watch/remote, create a new
Apple Watch app, and get Xplore cameras into the hands of users like you for a price that everyone can afford.  
Below are some design ideas we have been working on for a new watch/remote.
             




We're Ready to Ship 

We have a limited quanity of Xplore camera packages in stock and ready to ship to our earliest supporters within the month.  Our manufacturers are on standby and waiting for our call to begin the next production run.  Back us today and we'll be ready to ship on time.  We are super excited to get an Xplore into your hands and want to have you start sharing your experiences and footage with us.  We need your support to get our order made and start on the road to developing an Apple Watch app, updating the design of the watch/remote (coming late 2016) and building the brand and user base in the U.S. 


Supporter Perks

An Aggressive Timeline 
We can't see the future, but we've got 
plans beyond this timeline... With an initial product ready to ship for 
early adopters and a production run on its heels. Only with your help 
and support we can grow this technology together, the market is ripe for
 the next action cam and we're bringing it. We think you're gonna like it!

<li>Low quality</li>
<li>Dated designs</li>

Low quality
Dated designs
Unrealistic

<p></p>
<p><i>Q. Why should I use ParaCage instead of GorillaPod?</i></p>
<p>A. You can attach ParaCage to a tree up to 1.5 ft thick and it fits in your pocket. GorillaPod cannot do any of this.</p>
<p><i>Q. How do I select the the ParaCage version?</i></p>
<p>A. After the campaign is over you will fill out a poll where you will be able to select the exact version - the price is the same for all versions.</p>
<p><i>Q. How will the funding be used and will I receive my ParaCage if the goal is not reached?</i></p>
<p>A. The funds will be used for a limited production run to produce and shipping ParaCages to the backers. ParaCage is designed in such a way that it requires no initial investment in tooling. This makes even a very low production quantity feasible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Q. Love your design, it's quite ingenious. Just curious, do you have any background in manufacturing products?</i></p>
<p>A. I have a product design education and my first job was for a company making promotional materials - various branded trinkets - before moving to creative job in an agency. So I am well aware of the noisy and dusty environment, weekly sketch-to-shipment deadlines and the mantra of ""simplify design, use off-the-shelf parts, simplify again.""</p>

<br/><br/><br/><b>Hi Everyone! /Bonjour à tous!</b><br/><br/><p>I'm a french student, working thanks to photography. I take pictures for birthdays, weddings, engagements and so on for my studies, because I like photography and it's something I share with my father. (professional photographer) but I can't offer me a new camera), because this one start to be old and I don't know when it's gonna let me down. (More than 150 K pictures took with it). <br/>To be honest, it's not the only reason why I want to change this camera. My skills increased and this one I have (Nikon D3100- Got in 2011) don't fit anymore sadly..<br/><br/>I can't imagine being without a camera. I can live without a cellphone or anything but not without it. I earn money to live and, as I already said, to pay my studies and also, a car. <br/><br/>This camera would be a perfect thing to carry on my projets (as an exposition on galaxies, and the next one about women on horses<b> </b>throughout ages). <br/><br/>With my studies in psychology in France, I'd like to include photography within.. Why? <br/><br/>Photography help people feeling better. It helps people to feel better in their mind, body and they finally can learn to love them selves. But again, why? That is the question I'd like to study with this mix of psychology and photography. <br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Bonjour à tous ! <br/><br/>Je suis une étudiante française, travaillant grâce à la photo. Je prends des photos d'anniversaires, mariages, fiançailles et autres, pour payer mes études, car j'aime la photographie et c'est quelque chose que je partage avec mon père. (Photographe pro) mais je ne peux pas m'acheter un nouvel appareil photo, car celui ci commence à être vieux et je ne sais pas encore quand il va me lâcher. (plus de 150000 déclenchements). <br/>Pour être tout à fait honnête, ce n'est pas seulement la raison pour laquelle je veux changer mon appareil. <br/>Mes compétences en la matière ont augmentées et cet appareil que je possède (le Nikon D3100 - je l'ai eu en 2011) ne me convient plus malheureusement.  <br/><br/>Je ne me vois pas être sans appareil photo. Je peux vivre sans mon portable ou autre, mais pas sans ça. Je gagne mon argent ainsi pour vivre, et comme je l'ai déjà mentionné, pour payer mes études et aussi, mon permis et voiture.<br/><br/>Avec mes études en psychologie, je voudrais y inclure la photographie, mais pourquoi cette drôle d'idée me direz vous? <br/><br/>La photographie aide les gens à se sentir mieux, que cela soit dans leurs corps, têtes et ils peuvent enfin commencer à s'apprécier, ou du moins apprendre à le faire. Mais pourquoi encore? Comment le peuvent ils?<br/>C'est la question en effet, que je voudrais explorer en incorporant à la psychologie, la photographie. <br/><br/></p>

Taking pictures of Estonia and some other countries, especially at the Svalbard (I've been already there) far from 1200 miles of the North Pole, for taking pictures of Norway Lights. <br/><br/>My prizes are so uncommon. Helping me making this wish come true, I may offer you a picture of galaxy (or portraits, or a shooting) taking from the top of a moutain or down from the ground with beautiful stars. Printed in few formats, of your choices (according to your donation, of course!) but I will be really pleased to send it to you! For the Norway Lights, you might wait until next year, because of the sun during 6 months and it's already too late for me to get there.<br/><br/>And,... If unfortunetly, I can't raise the amount... Surely I'll buy the Nikon D750 or D610 to wait... But, I'm truly hoping you will help me ! You have to help ! <br/><br/>I'm won't take a lense with the camera, because I already got 3 that I always use, as the Nikon 500 mm f/1.4 and the 35 mm f/1.8 (Nikon again).<br/> <br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Il coute, sur le site MissNumerique (lien plus haut) comme vous pouvez le vérifier environ 3700 euros. <br/>Avec celui là, je pourrai prendre des photos de galaxies et après, avec un caisson étanche, des photos sous marines.<br/>Il y a avec ça des rêves que je voudrais réaliser, et je sais que je le ferait: prendre des photos en Estonie, mais plus spécifiquement encore, en Norvège au Svalbard ( à 1300km du Pole Nord) où j'ai déjà été, pour prendre des photos d'aurores boréales. <br/><br/>Mes prix ne seront pas communs. Si vous m'aidez à réaliser ce rêve, cet objectif, je vous offrirez alors une photo de galaxie (ou de portraits, ou encore un shooting si vous le voulez!) prise du haut d'une montagne, ou au ras du sol avec de magnifiques étoiles. Elles seront imprimées à différents formats, ceux de votre choix (en fonction du montant de votre donation bien entendu!) mais cela me fera un grand plaisir de vous les envoyer!<br/>Pour les aurores boréales, il me faudra, et vous faudra attendre l'an prochain, car à cette période ci, les 6 mois de jours ont déjà débutés, et donc, il est trop tard pour y aller. <br/><br/>Et.. si malheureusement je n'arrive pas à obtenir le plafond fixé... Sans doute que je me rabattrai à contre coeur sur une gamme moins élevé, comme le Nikon D750 ou D610.. Mais j'espère de tout MON COEUR et mon AME que vous m'aiderez. Vous devez m'aider! <br/><br/>Il y a des prix beaucoup plus élevés pour l'appareil photo, si l'on prend un objectif avec, mais je ne le ferai pas. Car j'utilise déjà mes 3 objectifs qui me conviennent parfaitement, dont les deux principaux : le 50 mm f/1.4 et le 35 mm f/1.8 par Nikon. <br/> <br/><br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","Hi Everyone! /Bonjour à tous!I'm a french student, working thanks to photography. I take pictures for birthdays, weddings, engagements and so on for my studies, because I like photography and it's something I share with my father. (professional photographer) but I can't offer me a new camera), because this one start to be old and I don't know when it's gonna let me down. (More than 150 K pictures took with it). To be honest, it's not the only reason why I want to change this camera. My skills increased and this one I have (Nikon D3100- Got in 2011) don't fit anymore sadly..I can't imagine being without a camera. I can live without a cellphone or anything but not without it. I earn money to live and, as I already said, to pay my studies and also, a car. This camera would be a perfect thing to carry on my projets (as an exposition on galaxies, and the next one about women on horses throughout ages). With my studies in psychology in France, I'd like to include photography within.. Why? Photography help people feeling better. It helps people to feel better in their mind, body and they finally can learn to love them selves. But again, why? That is the question I'd like to study with this mix of psychology and photography. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bonjour à tous ! Je suis une étudiante française, travaillant grâce à la photo. Je prends des photos d'anniversaires, mariages, fiançailles et autres, pour payer mes études, car j'aime la photographie et c'est quelque chose que je partage avec mon père. (Photographe pro) mais je ne peux pas m'acheter un nouvel appareil photo, car celui ci commence à être vieux et je ne sais pas encore quand il va me lâcher. (plus de 150000 déclenchements). Pour être tout à fait honnête, ce n'est pas seulement la raison pour laquelle je veux changer mon appareil. Mes compétences en la matière ont augmentées et cet appareil que je possède (le Nikon D3100 - je l'ai eu en 2011) ne me convient plus malheureusement.  Je ne me vois pas être sans appareil photo. Je peux vivre sans mon portable ou autre, mais pas sans ça. Je gagne mon argent ainsi pour vivre, et comme je l'ai déjà mentionné, pour payer mes études et aussi, mon permis et voiture.Avec mes études en psychologie, je voudrais y inclure la photographie, mais pourquoi cette drôle d'idée me direz vous? La photographie aide les gens à se sentir mieux, que cela soit dans leurs corps, têtes et ils peuvent enfin commencer à s'apprécier, ou du moins apprendre à le faire. Mais pourquoi encore? Comment le peuvent ils?C'est la question en effet, que je voudrais explorer en incorporant à la psychologie, la photographie. 

 What I need? / Ce dont j'ai besoin? 

This is the camera I'm dying to have/Voici l'appareil photo que je convoite : 

___________It costs on the website MissNumerique as you can check, 3700 euros, that's to say around 4135, 28$. With it, I will take galaxies pictures as wished and deep underwater's pictures.There's also a dream I want to realize... Taking pictures of Estonia and some other countries, especially at the Svalbard (I've been already there) far from 1200 miles of the North Pole, for taking pictures of Norway Lights. My prizes are so uncommon. Helping me making this wish come true, I may offer you a picture of galaxy (or portraits, or a shooting) taking from the top of a moutain or down from the ground with beautiful stars. Printed in few formats, of your choices (according to your donation, of course!) but I will be really pleased to send it to you! For the Norway Lights, you might wait until next year, because of the sun during 6 months and it's already too late for me to get there.And,... If unfortunetly, I can't raise the amount... Surely I'll buy the Nikon D750 or D610 to wait... But, I'm truly hoping you will help me ! You have to help ! I'm won't take a lense with the camera, because I already got 3 that I always use, as the Nikon 500 mm f/1.4 and the 35 mm f/1.8 (Nikon again). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Il coute, sur le site MissNumerique (lien plus haut) comme vous pouvez le vérifier environ 3700 euros. Avec celui là, je pourrai prendre des photos de galaxies et après, avec un caisson étanche, des photos sous marines.Il y a avec ça des rêves que je voudrais réaliser, et je sais que je le ferait: prendre des photos en Estonie, mais plus spécifiquement encore, en Norvège au Svalbard ( à 1300km du Pole Nord) où j'ai déjà été, pour prendre des photos d'aurores boréales. Mes prix ne seront pas communs. Si vous m'aidez à réaliser ce rêve, cet objectif, je vous offrirez alors une photo de galaxie (ou de portraits, ou encore un shooting si vous le voulez!) prise du haut d'une montagne, ou au ras du sol avec de magnifiques étoiles. Elles seront imprimées à différents formats, ceux de votre choix (en fonction du montant de votre donation bien entendu!) mais cela me fera un grand plaisir de vous les envoyer!Pour les aurores boréales, il me faudra, et vous faudra attendre l'an prochain, car à cette période ci, les 6 mois de jours ont déjà débutés, et donc, il est trop tard pour y aller. Et.. si malheureusement je n'arrive pas à obtenir le plafond fixé... Sans doute que je me rabattrai à contre coeur sur une gamme moins élevé, comme le Nikon D750 ou D610.. Mais j'espère de tout MON COEUR et mon AME que vous m'aiderez. Vous devez m'aider! Il y a des prix beaucoup plus élevés pour l'appareil photo, si l'on prend un objectif avec, mais je ne le ferai pas. Car j'utilise déjà mes 3 objectifs qui me conviennent parfaitement, dont les deux principaux : le 50 mm f/1.4 et le 35 mm f/1.8 par Nikon.  
This is the last picture I took with my boyfriend on it.  Of course, the stars aren't true on it, but so is the rest. Ceci est la dernière photo que j'ai prise avec mon copain dessus. Bien entendu, les étoiles ne sont pas réelles, mais le reste l'est. I'm sharing with you different pictures I took, between january 2015 and now, and you can also look at my little video backstage of the shoots. Je vous partage les différentes photos que j'ai prises entre janvier 2015 et maintenant, vous pouvez aussi regarder la vidéo des backstages des shoots que j'ai fais.

<p></p>
<p>SwapBounce is a simple yet versatile flash diffuser designed for event photography. In a single event, event photographers have to react instantly to ever-changing shooting conditions and adjust their camera setting accordingly. With SwapBounce, event photographers can instantly modify the usage of flash one-handed to suit different shooting conditions, without sacrificing any precious moments to be captured. SwapBounce is not bulky at all such that it will not affect the photographers’ movements.</p>

<span style=""font-size:10px;"">* Please contact me if I offend your portraiture right *</span></div>","What is SwapBounce?

SwapBounce is a simple yet versatile flash diffuser designed for event photography. In a single event, event photographers have to react instantly to ever-changing shooting conditions and adjust their camera setting accordingly. With SwapBounce, event photographers can instantly modify the usage of flash one-handed to suit different shooting conditions, without sacrificing any precious moments to be captured. SwapBounce is not bulky at all such that it will not affect the photographers’ movements.
















 Advantages


Versatile and Easy to use

Easily setups and allows instant switching among horizontal/vertical shooting with fill-in flash light and bounce-up flash light, shooting with bounce flash off of nearby large surface, and direct flash shooting.


Create Soft flash light

Provides ample and even soft light to minimize harsh shadow on subjects’ face or neck. Hence a natural look is captured. Even though high power flash light is fired, the light will still be soft.




Slim and Light weight

Built in durable and non-deformable plastic. By using frameless design, SwapBounce spreads flash light out evenly. It is only 60 grams (2 ounces), equivalent to the weight of 2 Eneloop® AA batteries.




Less annoying to surrounding people

Photographers capture precious moments with camera; others records the same moments with eyes and brain. SwapBounce prevent 50% of flash light from hitting others’ eyes.




Creating distinct Catchlight in eyes


Fit most medium and large External Hotshoe Flashes


 Disadvantages

SwapBounce contains super strong Neodymium magnets. Neodymium magnet is very magnetically sensitive to iron and magnet. Neodymium magnets on SwapBounce might detach if they are interfered with external magnetic force for long time. So, please keep SwapBounce away from iron and magnetic things.

However, are magnets safe around your camera gear?

YES. Please don't worry about that. It is safe around your camera, flashes, lenses and common electronic devices.


 Specifications

SwapBounce is made of top-quality material.
Let's take a closer look at the details of SwapBounce.


 Timeline

I always believe good photography could be achieved with useful yet not expensive equipment. So, I have invented a simple and handy flash diffuser for event photography. I hope to share it with other photographers. I have spent two years designing the diffuser, sourcing for suitable materials and refining the end products.
 Thank you for your support

As a micro entrepreneur, I have single-handedly created this diffuser, from designing, assembling, packing, and advertising to shipping. I hope you will find it useful and support it. Thank you.

The possibilities are just endless.






FROM FILM-MAKERS TO PRODUCT DESIGNERS!



The TBOX TANK came together three years ago out of necessity, when we had to specially design a hard protective case for our DSLR cameras to perform a long-term time-lapse recording on a building construction project. 






When the first TBOX TANK prototype was completed and deployed on-site, it delivered amazing results. With this special capability,
the number of our projects grew. We started getting many more long-term
time-lapse projects for  construction, land-reclamation, ship-building
and oil rigs. And before we knew it, we had installed more than 20 units of our TBOX TANK in the field at various sites.


We also realized the TBOX TANK improved the versatility of our DSLRs. We made more modifications along the way for the TBOX TANK to capture some shots that we ourselves think it's a little crazy.  

[DISCLAIMER: The TBOX TANK is watertight to a depth of 3.3 feet (or 1 meter) for 30 minutes (IP67) if properly closed with undamaged o-ring in place, as well as all lens rings and extension rings adequately tightened.  It is splash-proof only and not meant to replace the underwater housing. But, please feel free to take it to the pool or sea for a quick dip to get that quick below-the-water-surface shot with your DSLR that you've always wanted!] 

Encouraged by this, we kept refining the TBOX TANK as we put it into action in real projects. With enhanced usability, it greatly increased the number and variety of our projects.





We then thought about it, and said 'Why not share this with the world?'
This sparked off intensive efforts into research and development to ensure every technical aspect is covered. We spared no expense in testing out various materials, CNC-machinining different parts, and sacrificing several DSLRs too! 

Finally, after two years of perfecting the concept and design, the TBOX TANK is now ready for commercial release.

MAKING THE TBOX TANK AFFORDABLE

If we were to make each TBOX TANK individually, the retail value of a single TBOX TANK can be as high as US$2,000 because most of the parts require precision CNC-machining of solid metal blocks for that perfect fit and quality. It would not make sense for any protective case to cost more than a standard camera. We aim to bring the retail value to under US$1,000 for the TBOX TANK so more people can enjoy using this product to capture the great moments that they need.The retail value can be as low as US$900 each - only if we manufacture 100 units at a go - which we think will totally work for most people. Therefore, we need your help to cross this manufacturing hurdle to make the TBOX TANK even more affordable. 
And for the super early bird supporters of the TBOX TANK on Indiegogo, we want to offer all of you an additional discount off the Launch Price because we want you to use the TBOX TANK! We want you to cross the finishing line with us! 











MEET THE REST OF THE TBOX TANK FAMILY
During the course of our development, we added these three members to the TBOX TANK series:





The TANK pro is essentially a pimped out version of the TBOX TANK equipped with an add-on Solar Module which includes a customized solar panel, a solar charger, a distribution box, and a Canon-compatible intervalometer. 
Solar energy is the ideal power source for long-term time-lapse projects.

The best part is you do not need to get a separate device to set your time-lapse intervals, as the TANK pro comes fitted with a Canon-compatible intervalometer. Batteries are not included because it is also solar-powered. 










The TANK lite is for all mirrorless camera lovers. Almost all DSLRs, and the mirrorless GH4 will fit into our TBOX TANK. But, we also know 
there are many ardent fans of mirrorless cameras. So, we decided that we
 should not leave anyone out. Every camera deserves a hard protective 
case. And this is how the TANK lite is created to fit all popular 
mirrorless cameras, including the Sony A7 series and the micro 4/3 
cameras from Panasonic and Olympus.  







The TANK mini is a special protective case with built-in extended 
power for the GoPro Hero 4, allowing it to record non-stop for up to 20 hours 
on time-lapse mode (without WiFi). You can now capture longer time-lapse
 sequences on your GoPro Hero 4! Another dream made into reality!

VISUAL HISTORY of SOMETHING GOOD

We believe that a product cannot be as good if it does not help to make the world a better place. We have an exciting project involving another member of our TBOX family and time-lapse videos that could greatly contribute to society and humanity. 
Developed specially as a robust and heavy-duty industrial grade product, the solar-powered and weather-proof TBOX TITAN is designed and engineered to record long-term time-lapse over several years with the following capabilities and features: 3G/4G-enabled remote monitoring, cloud storage, as well as instant access to the 4K-resolution images anytime and anywhere.   
When we reach US$600,000, we will partner a non-profit housing organization by installing several of our TBOX TITAN systems to document some of their key building or reconstruction projects. 
TBOX TITAN Website









IF WE DO NOT REACH OUR GOALWe will top up any shortfall and proceed to manufacture the products for those who have pledged their support. We will keep remaining stocks as we believe the TBOX will find its way to many other users in the future.
It's an investment risk that we are willing to take to make sure that those of you who want the TBOX will get it at the Indiegogo Price we promised!
We appreciate all your support and are delighted that your cameras will be protected!

In many cases you can add additional devices to your existing data plan for free.WE NEED YOU - YOUR CREATIVITY IS OUR LIMITWe know that our project will really change the way we all watch and share live videos. A lot of projects only involve surveillance cameras and so limit creativity, but we decided to go much further.From now on, wherever there is a 4G network, there can be a TCAM. Whether for fun, for information, for sharing something cool or just seeing what's happening in real time, you now have the best device for that.No reception? No problem, TCAM also saves your videos to its internal memory.With existing sharing solutions, we believe that the world of video has reached its limits. It is time to take the next step and make the world TRANSPARENT.Our team comes from different backgrounds, and all of us have completed several exciting projects in our careers. Today, we face a new challenge with the TCAM. And for that, we need you. So, if you believe in the project, please support us!​TIME LINEINDIEGOGO Goal:With this sum we will be able to finalize the prototype phase, including financing the final PCB (wiki page). And then we will be able pay the factory to launch a first series of the product, to 1000 units.If we do not reach our goal, we will be able to finalize the prototype and launch production, but with a smaller number of units. This is not a problem in itself for those who will contribute. The TCAM will only be used by a small elite group, ready to dive into the world of live video! :) Other ways to help:)Maybe you can’t contribute right now but you still want to help us? There is nothing easier. Simply share our Indiegogo page or social media website and tell your friends. You can also repost our news articles, or discuss about them on different blogs or forums.And, if you are a journalist or work in a media outlet, do not hesitate to contact us. We can provide you with a press kit and other types of media. Risks and challenges:To finalize the TCAM project and be able to deliver on time, the main difficulty will be to find a mass production plant in China, and follow the assembly circuit day by day. But don’t worry, we have everything planned! Part of our team is located in Asia, which will allow us to have one or more partners on site who will follow this important step. They will produce regular reports that we will communicate to you, so that you are kept informed of all that is happening during this phase. And then, you will only have to worry about enjoying your TCAM ;) WHO'S BEHIND THE SCENES?An experienced and effective team!Transparent’s founders earned their stripes at Apple and eBay in support, IT and sales.The whole team strives to ensure the success of the project.Q&AWhat is an eSIM?​it's an integrated SIM card that cannot to be removed from a device.The eSIM allows the TCAM 4G (LTE) to connect to your network operator, to get data independently without Bluetooth® pairing to your smartphone.How do I activate my TCAM eSIM card?​TCAM is activated by scanning a QR code, and then uses data from the data plan you currently have.What if I don't have 4G signal?​TCAM includes internal memory, so, if you don’t have signal, your camera saves the content and sends it out when the network is available. You will never lose what you are filming or have filmed!Is there a cost for cloud storage ?Every plan includes 7 days of free cloud recordings. If that's not enough, you can subscribe to one of our paid offers.Can I use the usual data plan I have with my smartphone? Of course, if you already have a plan for your smartphone, you can easily pair your TCAM with it.How much data does the TCAM use?​The amount of data used will be based on the type of plan and camera being used. This can also fluctuate based on whether you stream constantly or in bits.How long does it take to charge the battery?​TCAM needs about 3 hours to fully charge.Is TCAM splash and dust resistant? Yes, TCAM benefits from the IP44 protection rating.When will my TCAM be delivered?TCAM is currently in the final prototype conception phase, and delivery date is set at November 2018. We will be in touch if there are any changes.",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

The ADASISAN generously showers you with a wealth of visual information to make using your car a completely stress-free activity. Through its unique Virtual Scene Reconstruction technology, the ADASISAN system is able to continuously stitch together a near-seamless, extremely life-like, video of the entireenvironment surrounding your car. And it does it in real time, at 33 frames per second, with no lag or fuzziness in the video it produces. 4 super-wide angle High Definition cameras, each capable of seeing nearly 180 degrees.One goes on your front bumper, one on your back bumper, one on your left sideview mirrorand one on your right sideview mirror. Together, the ADASISAN system monitors Every single angle and never misses a thing.With typical rear view cameras, the ultrawide fisheye lens distorts the image so badly that the guidelines are provided to give you a better sense of your car’s width. On the other hand, the ADASISAN’s Seamless Image Splicing Technology automatically adjusts the images you see to provide a more realistic, easily-understood picture.But what about when your car is parked and you’re not around ? We’ve all experienced the horror of returning to our cars and seeing scratches made by some other driver backing into or out of a neighbouring parking spot. Most of the time, the driver would have fled the scene, knowing that you won’t who it was that hit your car. Guess what? The ADASISAN senses thetiniest of movements and immediately reacts by recording video. Result? The offender will be captured on video, so you can track down his or her car using its license plate number. 16GB Built-in to store every moment of the car experience. You can check the records at any time to get a real-time situation by remote control. IP67 waterproof rating, which means that the cameras can even be submerged in 1-metre deep water for up to half and hour.Whether you are driving a small compact car, sedan, SUV, pick-up truck or minivan, the ADASISAN’s 4 Cameras can be installed in your vehicle. Because the interface of our output video is RCA(the same as Universal Vehicle Backup Camera), it will work well if your monitor screen or radio has the RCA input connector.Step 1. Install the main board power cable: Need install 4pcs power cables, they are : Positive electricty (yellow), ACC (Pink), parking reverse input wire(white) and ground wire(black)Step 2. Mount and fix 4 cameras: Front view camera : usually it mounted in the middle of central grille ; Rear view camera: at the rear bumper; Left and right view camera: under the left and right mirror separately;Step 3. Connect with DVD/Navigator displayer, cameras and main board Connect the main board 40PIN wires with video input wire of DVD/Navigator displayer(or the reverse parking output wire) and left/right cameras.Select lens parameters and calibration cloth type, enter the distance value(the unit is cm) of AB, BC , click CLB to calibrate, there will be two options: auto / manual calibration,  “auto” is recommended, manual type please refer to the installation and calibration manual.    Have a question?Production Status Thank you so much for your support us.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Are you ready for stills? Landscapes? Architecture? Ready for video &amp; cinema? Pano? Macro? Ready for large format or ultra-large format? FLM's new tripod is ready for you.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508542854/fa95476ep3jyug8bhgsg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Ari, I'm the FLM distributor for the US and Canada.  We're very fortunate to work with a great company like FLM because of the high quality of their ball heads and tripods, backed up by an excellent 10-year warranty.</p>
<p>We're thrilled about last year's incredibly <u><strong><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flm-the-ultimate-travel-tripod-photography/x/11127085#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">successful crowdfunding for the CP26-Travel tripod</a></strong></u>,<strong> </strong>and we're still having trouble keeping up with demand; we're in our sixth production run, demand keeps growing, and great reviews keep coming in. We set out to make the best travel tripod in the world, and we accomplished that, but we don't want to rest on our laurels.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508518173/nxedvxqzhgh8u8l7bdqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>A Little Background...</h3>
<p>The <strong><i>Berlin 38.4</i></strong> will be the first tripod to be introduced by FLM Canada/USA. We've also assumed sole responsibility for FLM's crowdfunding program in North America, the aim of which is to introduce new FLM products to the public before they are sold in retail stores.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083145/qzlll7qaejfusdkaatre.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A New Series - The Berlin</h3>
<p>We'll be introducing at least two tripods in the course of the next 8-12 months as part of our new <strong>""Berlin""</strong> series. The Berlin tripods all share these specs and features:</p>
<ul>
<li>10-layer carbon fibre tubes</li>
<li>one-piece milled aluminum apex</li>
<li>removable center plate or bowl adapter</li>
<li>allow use of both 75mm and 100mm bowl systems</li>
<li>an extremely high weight-to-load-capacity ratio</li>
<li>one-piece leg shims</li>
</ul>
<p>The first tripod in this series is the <i><strong>Berlin 38.4</strong></i>, or simply, the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i>: ""38"" refers to the largest carbon tube diameter (38mm), and ""4"" is the number of sections per leg. It promises to be the steadiest, most rock-solid tripod in its class, and one that you can pre-order right now. You have the chance to own this amazing tripod before it arrives in stores, and you can buy it here at up to 31% off the retail price.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083555/kdefjd17mqpcdxa6vvoz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The only significant part left to work on is completing the design of the flat plate; the flat plate sits on top of the tripod, supports the ball head, and will have an integrated hook. We're also finalizing details on levelling bowls for both 75mm and 100mm adapters.</p>
<p>The flat plate design modifications, and refinements to the design of the levelling bowls, will be the basis of our progress updates.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need</h2>
<p>We're a small company, but we've managed to build a loyal following because of the excellence of our ball heads and tripods, and by having great customers who tell others about FLM. Our success with the CP26-Travel helped us become much better-known, and we hope that the promotion and success of the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> tripod here at Indiegogo will allow us to offer this tripod, and other interesting models, as part of our regular catalogue, not only as a limited-production item.</p>
<p>We need your help to do this: use the tripod, review it, or tell others about it; recommend it, and give us feedback on how good it is, or if it can be better.</p>
<p>We are doing this both to create a buzz around our new tripod, as well as to see if it should be made in larger quantities and become a catalogue mainstay. Our goal of $9500.00 is needed only to start the first production run. Our primary motivation with this crowdfunding is to offer the <i><strong>Berlin 38.4</strong></i> to as many people as possible, and hope to build enough momentum through word-of-mouth promotion so that it will become a mainstay of our line-up. If successful, this will also give us the freedom in the future to have other tripods designed and built, and thus be able to make a wider variety of tripods than what we currently offer.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this benefits everyone: we'll have an expanded, more interesting line-up of tripods, and you, the customer, will have better and more varied choices when it comes to deciding on a high-quality tripod.</p>

<h2>What You Get: Fantastic Tripod, Great Price</h2>
<p>The <i><strong>Berlin 38.4</strong></i> is a lightweight, 10-layer carbon fibre tripod, equally at home in the studio as it is on the street; in a rainstorm or a blizzard; at the South Pole or in the Namibian Desert. The tripod is light enough to carry with you all day, and folds compactly enough to bring with you on long trips. Whereas the CP26-Travel was a great lightweight and strong solution for the specific purpose of travel, the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> should be almost as easy to transport, while being well-suited to very large and heavy cameras, and able to withstand a lot of daily abuse.</p>
<p>The 10 layers of carbon fibre are made from our patented weaving process for maximum strength and minimal weight. Why should that matter? As you'll see below, <strong>the 38.4 is capable of carrying loads many times its own weight, at a much higher ratio than any tripod we've previously made</strong>. And like our other tripods, the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> is easy to use, unobtrusive, portable, and capable of supporting the heaviest cameras and lenses with ease. Its deceptively simple design means less internal parts, so less things can go wrong, and it's an excellent all-day companion.</p>
<p>We wanted to keep weight and bulk to a minimum, wherever possible, so we've designed an apex that is equally comfortable supporting both a 75mm bowl and a 100mm bowl, and we're offering those accessories here. <strong>You'll be able to use your choice of 75mm or 100mm bowl adapters and accessories on one tripod</strong>, making the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> a greatly enhanced and versatile tripod.</p>
<p>We expect the retail price for the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> to be $809.00 USD, which, when compared to similarly-sized tripods (i.e., Gitzo Series 4 or RRS TVC-34), is a great price. But we're offering it here for as little as $558.00, and you'll have yours before the tripod hits the stores. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508002144/tyb9wmlgzswdichvazsg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>If you purchase a tripod here, you'll get it; it's that simple. If we fail to meet our $9500 target, all buyers will get their perks, on time, no matter the outcome of the Indiegogo campaign.</strong></p>
<p>If we sell only one tripod, then that one tripod will be delivered on time, as promised. But if enough people buy the tripod here, that will enable us to make the tripod for years to come. Our CP26-Travel tripod, which is still a top-seller one year later, is becoming an industry standard for its class.</p>
<p>But our immediate goal is to get this tripod into as many peoples' hands as is possible through our crowdfunding platform because we know how well a good project attracts good attention.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Quality</h3>
<p>We will not sacrifice stability or build-quality for flashy, gimmicky features, especially if they do not serve the serious photographer.</p>
<p>We use only the highest-quality materials, superb design, and we offer world-class products that are meant to last for many years under hard use. Our unofficial motto has always been <strong>""Buy well, buy once""</strong> and we happily stand behind that.</p>
<p>Our 10-year warranty is the best in the business. That means you'll always have spare parts and expert help when it's needed. We get fewer than 1 in 1,000 returns due to manufacturing errors, we've had a proven track record for over 24 years, and our quality-control has always been among the best.</p>

<h3><strong>NEW: A review of the Berlin 38.4 for Tech.co online gear: <a href=""https://tech.co/flm-berlin-tripod-professional-2017-11/amp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>https://tech.co/flm-berlin-tripod-professional-2017-11/amp</u></a></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Berlin 38.4 Tripod</h3>
<p>Photographers around the world have been asking us for a big tripod for several years; they asked for absolute stability and top performance no matter how large or heavy their photo or video gear; they also wanted modularity in using tripod accessories, like bowls and ball heads. And they wanted portability as well as packability.</p>
<p>So we're very pleased to finally offer the <strong>​<i>Berlin </i></strong>series of tripods. Here are the specs for the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i>:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083633/tcd90rdux7aalpyt7bae.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The apex of our tripod is CNC-milled from a solid block of aluminum; this gives it unparalleled strength while keeping a low profile, and helps in keeping the overall weight down as well. The apex is specially anodized in black for a sleek, low-key finish.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083698/xq0crwtotynpaffnfa4p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What are Bowls and Why Use Them?</h3>
<p>Bowls are used in larger tripods in place of a center post, and also in place of a head, in some cases. Motion and video shooters have been using this system for decades. Bowl adapters clamp into the empty space at the tripod's apex, and using the adapters, you can then attach a number of different accessories, the most common being leveling bowls. Leveling bowls usually consist of a half-sphere with a stud screw, all atop a short stem that tightens or loosens the bowl inside its adapter. Most manufacturers follow a standard size and dovetail when designing their bowls and adapters, making most of them interchangeable across different brands.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508518234/dcp6tgeg9wc3bkmsa8yu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Berlin 38.4 with FLM 100mm bowl adapter and Desmond Photo 100mm bowl</strong></i></p>
<p>Using a leveling bowl instead of a ball head makes your kit lighter, less bulky - and less expensive. Many bowls offer 15˚- 20˚ of leveling in any direction, which is sufficient for most applications. In our tests, we used the Berlin 38.4 with a Gitzo Series 2,3,4 bowl adapter and a Manfrotto 75mm leveling bowl; the parts worked together seamlessly. Most manufacturers design their tripods to accept either 75mm or 100mm bowls, but not both. The <i><strong>Berlin 38.4</strong></i> can use both sizes. Just make sure your other-brand accessories will fit to the Berlin's 85mm apex diameter. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509372695/y2bc02wbtuwygijv18qd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <i><strong>Berlin 38.4</strong></i> is thus set up to be a perfect companion to still and motion picture photographers. It uses both 75mm and 100mm bowl adapters, so you can use a variety of bowls and accessories from FLM; if you already own standard-size bowl adapters and other parts from other manufacturers, those will work, too (see FAQ #1). The 75mm &amp; 100mm bowl system is ideal for videographers, cinematographers, documentarians, birders and spotters.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083665/gmdnuizchqgyodi9ekbv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Don't want to use the bowl system? No problem, the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> tripod ships with a flat plate and hook assembly. Just attach your favourite head and start shooting.</p>
<p>This tripod is our second, after the CP26-Travel, to use 10 layers of high-grade carbon fibre. These extra layers add very little to the overall weight, but greatly enhance the tripod's load capacity.</p>
<p>To put the weight of the <i><strong>Berlin 38.4</strong></i> in perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>FLM CP26-Travel --- 1.28kg (2.82 lbs.)</li>
<li>FLM Berlin 38.4 ----- 2.25kg (4.96 lbs.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i><strong>Berlin 38.4</strong></i> weighs only 0.97kg (2.14 lbs) more than the CP26-Travel tripod. The CP26-Travel can carry more than 9 times its weight, which is very impressive, especially for a 5-section travel tripod. But<strong> the 38.4 can carry almost 18 times its weight</strong>, which guarantees that your gear will be safe, steady and as free from vibration as possible at all times.</p>
<p>We're also continuing with one-piece leg shims; these were introduced on the CP26-Travel, and so far, after one year, we haven't had a single request for leg shim replacement. The design is working perfectly, we're happy with it, so we're keeping this feature with the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> tripod.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083437/djtfpfo9ucrfi3hhwrku.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And we're leaving our leg grips in bare brushed aluminum. We like to keep potential problems to a minimum, especially for a tripod that's going to give some heavy-duty support. The aluminum grips will work in all kinds of weather, and will last much longer than their rubber-covered counterparts. The feel of aluminum grips is more precise, so over-tightening/under-tightening problems are minimized. The overall weight has been further reduced by using leg locks made of a lighter and thinner aluminum alloy that still provide all the gripping power needed for a tripod of this caliber.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083399/b2sn09zntegbncznvuht.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <i><strong>38.4</strong></i>'s legs will only fold down, they won't reverse and fold back; while we've designed fold-back legs on every tripod we've ever made, it wasn't possible on the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i> because of the larger apex and the modified design of the load arms. These load arms were made to absorb more vibration and keep the tripod steady under extreme weight, and that design prevents the legs from folding back.</p>
<p>Another noticeable aspect of the tripod is that the apex is tightened and loosened by a screw, which takes an allen key; some manufacturers use a lever or ratchet design to tighten the apex, while others have kept the simpler screw design. We've considered this part for a while, and decided to keep the screw function because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the hex screw can be precisely adjusted</li>
<li>less moving parts, less things to go wrong</li>
<li>a lever requires regular adjustment </li>
<li>it can be over-tightened, or flipped open by accident</li>
<li>it only takes slightly more time to use the allen key as it would a lever</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083315/xr2yfhpdntvx0i9hgkff.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The tripod includes heavy-duty integrated steel spiked feet with rubber-foot screw covers; simply unscrew and remove the rubber feet to use the spikes.</p>

<p>We supply a flat plate so you can start using your tripod right away. This aluminum flat plate includes the 3/8"" stud screw and is covered in our special cork/rubber material which provides superior protection against slippage; it won't dry out in the sun, or get slick in the rain. The bottom of the flat plate has a short centre post ending in a hook assembly. That means you'll be able to use the tripod at its minimum height of 8cm (3.14"") and still keep the flat plate attached. Three nylon-covered screws are countersunk to secure ball heads. We'll keep you updated on that as we finalize the design and production.</p>

<p>We wanted a tripod bag that offers good protection and quick access to gear with a minimum of fuss, and we've sourced just such a carrying bag for the tripod. This conical padded tripod bag has enough room to hold the<i><strong> 38.4</strong></i> tripod with a CB-58FTR ball head mounted, it's tough enough to last years under hard use, and it's comfortable to carry in the field. There's an adjustable strap for over-the-shoulder use, and the bag can be opened at the top only, if preferred, for quick access to the tripod. There are also carrying handles, and inside the bag is a small zippered pouch for carrying your tripod tool kit.</p>
<p><strong>Now, let's talk bowls. Again.</strong></p>
<p>We offer two accessory kits for your tripod: a bowl adapter with a levelling half-bowl, available in both 75mm and 100mm sizes. The leveling bowl and adapter are sold together and permit the use of a variety of photo and video heads for your tripod.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507083797/eggx1uvz25exzgsyoyxt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Once a bowl is attached, you're ready for anything. Ready for still. Ready for video &amp; cinema. Ready for pano. Ready for macro. Ready for large format. Ready for ultra-large format. Ready for anything you want to do.</p>
<p>The levelling bowl does a great job of replacing a ball head in many situations. The levelling bowl gives 20˚ of movement in any direction, more than enough for many applications. It can easily handle 40kg of camera and lens as well, making it a great choice for multi-format shooters. It locks down solid and tight.</p>
<p>The bowl adapters are made from a solid piece of aluminum, CNC-machined to perfection, with holes drilled into them for lighter weight and to reduce friction.</p>

<p>If you opt for a perk that includes a ball head, your ball head will come with the Arca-compatible SRB-60 clamp installed. The SRB-60 clamp has a large tolerance for all widths of Arca-compatible plates, and is considered a universal clamp. Our highly-rated ball heads are solid, strong and don't creep in the slightest, meaning you can always count on them for critical work. Use the ball head and bowl together for maximum versatility and endless possibilities of precision positioning.</p>
<p>The bowl adapters, levelling bowls, ball heads and clamps, are also under warranty for 10 years.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Support</h3>
<p>If you have any questions of any kind related to the Berlin 38.4, please write us anytime. We answer emails pretty quickly, even if we're on the road.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Refunds</h3>
<p>If you're not 100% satisfied with the Berlin 38.4, simply notify us and return it for a full refund within 14 days of receiving it. If you're not sure that you'll keep it, we ask that you try to keep it as new-looking as possible until you've decided. That's it.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Shipping the Perks</h3>
<p>Orders will ship from Canada to any Paypal-verified US or Canada address. There is no duty to pay if you are in the US. But if it happens, let us know, and we'll re-imburse your Duty fees.</p>
<p>Shipping is extra and depending on the perk chosen, ranges from $24 to $34. Canadian and US customers pay the same shipping fees. We've arranged for special reduced shipping rates for North America using Purolator/UPS. All shipments will be by courier and will require a signature.</p>
<p>Contact me by email if you have any special requests, be it for shipping or for other FLM items not listed here. I'll make sure you get it.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Delivery Date</h3>
<p>We estimate the delivery date to be roughly 8-10 weeks after the Indiegogo campaign ends, which takes us to late January/early February. But this is usually an extremely busy time for shipping companies and many supplier delays tend to occur around this time. The post-Xmas shipping season is very busy and causes unforeseen delays. It happened to us last year, which was the cause of one significant delay in shipping the CP26-Travel.</p>
<p>For this reason, I'm going to set a shipping date of February 15. This means that <strong>the tripods will ship from Canada to our supporters no later than February 15</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>If it can be done earlier, I'll certainly make it happen</strong>, but given the time of year and based on past experience, I'd like to have a little wiggle room. </p>

<h2><u><strong>FAQs:</strong></u></h2>
<p><strong>1. Can I use my Gitzo/Manfrotto/Induro/RRS, etc. accessories on the Berlin 38.4? </strong>The short answer is ""Yes, but..."". Here's the long answer: while we've tested the Berlin with some other brand's accessories, we have not done exhaustive tests to make sure all brands conform to the same shape and size for the apex. The Berlin 38.4 has an inner apex diameter of 84.9mm (85mm), so please make sure that if you already own, for example, a Gitzo center post from Series 4 or 5, that its plate will fit the Berlin's apex.</p>
<p><strong>2. Why can't you ship to me in Europe/Asia/Australia?</strong> This campaign is a US/Canada initiative, Europe and Asia-Pacific are not our distribution territories. In the near future, this tripod may be available in other territories as well. As Canada/US distributors, we cannot sell FLM gear outside of North America.</p>
<p><strong>3. Who can buy the tripod? </strong>Anyone can buy the tripod, but we need either a US or Canada shipping address, verified through Paypal or through your credit card.</p>
<p><strong>4. Why is this only an FLM Canada/USA project?</strong> In order to gauge whether the Berlin 38.4 will become a regular catalogue item, we will test it in North America first. Based on Indiegogo interest, peer and user reviews, we will either continue making it, or produce for existing orders, then only make a small run once a year of about 3-5 tripods. FLM Germany are not involved at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you offer the same warranty as before?</strong> Absolutely, yes. We offer FLM's standard 10-year warranty. Parts and repair are in Canada, same as always.</p>
<p><strong>6. What is your refund/return policy?</strong> If you aren't 100% impressed by the <i><strong>38.4</strong></i>, contact us and send back your tripod for a full refund. We'll give you 15 days from the date of delivery to decide. All we ask is that if you're not sure about the tripod, please try to keep it looking new and scratch-free.</p>
<p><strong>7. What if I have a problem with my new tripod?</strong> Call or write us; if needed, we'll ask that you send us the problem part, or the whole tripod. We'll take care of the problem within 48 hours. If it can't be repaired quickly, we'll issue you a new tripod.</p>
<p><strong>8. Do you have a US address for sending repairs?</strong> Yes, but response time will be slower. Contact us ahead of time and we'll send you the US shipping address.</p>
<p><strong>9. Are replacement parts going to be made available?</strong> Not for general sale at stores, but replacement parts can be ordered from FLM Canada, and they're free if it's the result of a manufacturing flaw.</p>
<p><strong>10. Can I ask you any question, anytime, about the <i>Berlin 38.4</i> tripod or other FLM gear?</strong> Yes, absolutely!</p>

Nick Page's new review of the Berlin 38.4:

 
Are you ready for stills? Landscapes? Architecture? Ready for video & cinema? Pano? Macro? Ready for large format or ultra-large format? FLM's new tripod is ready for you.
 
    
My name is Ari, I'm the FLM distributor for the US and Canada.  We're very fortunate to work with a great company like FLM because of the high quality of their ball heads and tripods, backed up by an excellent 10-year warranty.
We're thrilled about last year's incredibly successful crowdfunding for the CP26-Travel tripod, and we're still having trouble keeping up with demand; we're in our sixth production run, demand keeps growing, and great reviews keep coming in. We set out to make the best travel tripod in the world, and we accomplished that, but we don't want to rest on our laurels.

A Little Background...
The Berlin 38.4 will be the first tripod to be introduced by FLM Canada/USA. We've also assumed sole responsibility for FLM's crowdfunding program in North America, the aim of which is to introduce new FLM products to the public before they are sold in retail stores.

A New Series - The Berlin
We'll be introducing at least two tripods in the course of the next 8-12 months as part of our new ""Berlin"" series. The Berlin tripods all share these specs and features:

10-layer carbon fibre tubes
one-piece milled aluminum apex
removable center plate or bowl adapter
allow use of both 75mm and 100mm bowl systems
an extremely high weight-to-load-capacity ratio
one-piece leg shims

The first tripod in this series is the Berlin 38.4, or simply, the 38.4: ""38"" refers to the largest carbon tube diameter (38mm), and ""4"" is the number of sections per leg. It promises to be the steadiest, most rock-solid tripod in its class, and one that you can pre-order right now. You have the chance to own this amazing tripod before it arrives in stores, and you can buy it here at up to 31% off the retail price.

The only significant part left to work on is completing the design of the flat plate; the flat plate sits on top of the tripod, supports the ball head, and will have an integrated hook. We're also finalizing details on levelling bowls for both 75mm and 100mm adapters.
The flat plate design modifications, and refinements to the design of the levelling bowls, will be the basis of our progress updates.
What We Need
We're a small company, but we've managed to build a loyal following because of the excellence of our ball heads and tripods, and by having great customers who tell others about FLM. Our success with the CP26-Travel helped us become much better-known, and we hope that the promotion and success of the 38.4 tripod here at Indiegogo will allow us to offer this tripod, and other interesting models, as part of our regular catalogue, not only as a limited-production item.
We need your help to do this: use the tripod, review it, or tell others about it; recommend it, and give us feedback on how good it is, or if it can be better.
We are doing this both to create a buzz around our new tripod, as well as to see if it should be made in larger quantities and become a catalogue mainstay. Our goal of $9500.00 is needed only to start the first production run. Our primary motivation with this crowdfunding is to offer the Berlin 38.4 to as many people as possible, and hope to build enough momentum through word-of-mouth promotion so that it will become a mainstay of our line-up. If successful, this will also give us the freedom in the future to have other tripods designed and built, and thus be able to make a wider variety of tripods than what we currently offer.
Ultimately, this benefits everyone: we'll have an expanded, more interesting line-up of tripods, and you, the customer, will have better and more varied choices when it comes to deciding on a high-quality tripod.


What You Get: Fantastic Tripod, Great Price
The Berlin 38.4 is a lightweight, 10-layer carbon fibre tripod, equally at home in the studio as it is on the street; in a rainstorm or a blizzard; at the South Pole or in the Namibian Desert. The tripod is light enough to carry with you all day, and folds compactly enough to bring with you on long trips. Whereas the CP26-Travel was a great lightweight and strong solution for the specific purpose of travel, the 38.4 should be almost as easy to transport, while being well-suited to very large and heavy cameras, and able to withstand a lot of daily abuse.
The 10 layers of carbon fibre are made from our patented weaving process for maximum strength and minimal weight. Why should that matter? As you'll see below, the 38.4 is capable of carrying loads many times its own weight, at a much higher ratio than any tripod we've previously made. And like our other tripods, the 38.4 is easy to use, unobtrusive, portable, and capable of supporting the heaviest cameras and lenses with ease. Its deceptively simple design means less internal parts, so less things can go wrong, and it's an excellent all-day companion.
We wanted to keep weight and bulk to a minimum, wherever possible, so we've designed an apex that is equally comfortable supporting both a 75mm bowl and a 100mm bowl, and we're offering those accessories here. You'll be able to use your choice of 75mm or 100mm bowl adapters and accessories on one tripod, making the 38.4 a greatly enhanced and versatile tripod.
We expect the retail price for the 38.4 to be $809.00 USD, which, when compared to similarly-sized tripods (i.e., Gitzo Series 4 or RRS TVC-34), is a great price. But we're offering it here for as little as $558.00, and you'll have yours before the tripod hits the stores. 


If you purchase a tripod here, you'll get it; it's that simple. If we fail to meet our $9500 target, all buyers will get their perks, on time, no matter the outcome of the Indiegogo campaign.
If we sell only one tripod, then that one tripod will be delivered on time, as promised. But if enough people buy the tripod here, that will enable us to make the tripod for years to come. Our CP26-Travel tripod, which is still a top-seller one year later, is becoming an industry standard for its class.
But our immediate goal is to get this tripod into as many peoples' hands as is possible through our crowdfunding platform because we know how well a good project attracts good attention.
 
Quality
We will not sacrifice stability or build-quality for flashy, gimmicky features, especially if they do not serve the serious photographer.
We use only the highest-quality materials, superb design, and we offer world-class products that are meant to last for many years under hard use. Our unofficial motto has always been ""Buy well, buy once"" and we happily stand behind that.
Our 10-year warranty is the best in the business. That means you'll always have spare parts and expert help when it's needed. We get fewer than 1 in 1,000 returns due to manufacturing errors, we've had a proven track record for over 24 years, and our quality-control has always been among the best.
 
NEW: A review of the Berlin 38.4 for Tech.co online gear: https://tech.co/flm-berlin-tripod-professional-2017-11/amp
 
The Berlin 38.4 Tripod
Photographers around the world have been asking us for a big tripod for several years; they asked for absolute stability and top performance no matter how large or heavy their photo or video gear; they also wanted modularity in using tripod accessories, like bowls and ball heads. And they wanted portability as well as packability.
So we're very pleased to finally offer the ​Berlin series of tripods. Here are the specs for the 38.4:

Tripod Name: Berlin 38.4

Materials: interwoven 10x carbon fibre, aluminum alloy CNC-milled apex bowl

Leg Sections: 4

Leg section diameter: 38mm, 34mm, 30mm, 26mm

Weight: 2,25 kg (4.96 lbs.) - without centre post/plate
Load capacity: 40kg (88.18 lbs)

Weight-to-Load-Capacity Ratio: 1 : 17.7

Max height: 143cm (56.29"")

Min height: 8cm (3.14"")

Folded length: 52cm (20.47"")

Folded diameter (at apex): 16.4cm (6.45"")

Apex bowl mount: 75mm & 100mm

Ball head mount: 3/8"" & 1/4""

Foot assembly: integrated steel spikes, rubber screw-on feet 
Leg locks: aluminum alloy

Other materials: cork/rubber surface on flat plate

Bubble level: integrated 


The apex of our tripod is CNC-milled from a solid block of aluminum; this gives it unparalleled strength while keeping a low profile, and helps in keeping the overall weight down as well. The apex is specially anodized in black for a sleek, low-key finish.

What are Bowls and Why Use Them?
Bowls are used in larger tripods in place of a center post, and also in place of a head, in some cases. Motion and video shooters have been using this system for decades. Bowl adapters clamp into the empty space at the tripod's apex, and using the adapters, you can then attach a number of different accessories, the most common being leveling bowls. Leveling bowls usually consist of a half-sphere with a stud screw, all atop a short stem that tightens or loosens the bowl inside its adapter. Most manufacturers follow a standard size and dovetail when designing their bowls and adapters, making most of them interchangeable across different brands.

Berlin 38.4 with FLM 100mm bowl adapter and Desmond Photo 100mm bowl
Using a leveling bowl instead of a ball head makes your kit lighter, less bulky - and less expensive. Many bowls offer 15˚- 20˚ of leveling in any direction, which is sufficient for most applications. In our tests, we used the Berlin 38.4 with a Gitzo Series 2,3,4 bowl adapter and a Manfrotto 75mm leveling bowl; the parts worked together seamlessly. Most manufacturers design their tripods to accept either 75mm or 100mm bowls, but not both. The Berlin 38.4 can use both sizes. Just make sure your other-brand accessories will fit to the Berlin's 85mm apex diameter. 

The Berlin 38.4 is thus set up to be a perfect companion to still and motion picture photographers. It uses both 75mm and 100mm bowl adapters, so you can use a variety of bowls and accessories from FLM; if you already own standard-size bowl adapters and other parts from other manufacturers, those will work, too (see FAQ #1). The 75mm & 100mm bowl system is ideal for videographers, cinematographers, documentarians, birders and spotters.  

Don't want to use the bowl system? No problem, the 38.4 tripod ships with a flat plate and hook assembly. Just attach your favourite head and start shooting.
This tripod is our second, after the CP26-Travel, to use 10 layers of high-grade carbon fibre. These extra layers add very little to the overall weight, but greatly enhance the tripod's load capacity.
To put the weight of the Berlin 38.4 in perspective:

FLM CP26-Travel --- 1.28kg (2.82 lbs.)
FLM Berlin 38.4 ----- 2.25kg (4.96 lbs.)

The Berlin 38.4 weighs only 0.97kg (2.14 lbs) more than the CP26-Travel tripod. The CP26-Travel can carry more than 9 times its weight, which is very impressive, especially for a 5-section travel tripod. But the 38.4 can carry almost 18 times its weight, which guarantees that your gear will be safe, steady and as free from vibration as possible at all times.
We're also continuing with one-piece leg shims; these were introduced on the CP26-Travel, and so far, after one year, we haven't had a single request for leg shim replacement. The design is working perfectly, we're happy with it, so we're keeping this feature with the 38.4 tripod.

And we're leaving our leg grips in bare brushed aluminum. We like to keep potential problems to a minimum, especially for a tripod that's going to give some heavy-duty support. The aluminum grips will work in all kinds of weather, and will last much longer than their rubber-covered counterparts. The feel of aluminum grips is more precise, so over-tightening/under-tightening problems are minimized. The overall weight has been further reduced by using leg locks made of a lighter and thinner aluminum alloy that still provide all the gripping power needed for a tripod of this caliber.

The 38.4's legs will only fold down, they won't reverse and fold back; while we've designed fold-back legs on every tripod we've ever made, it wasn't possible on the 38.4 because of the larger apex and the modified design of the load arms. These load arms were made to absorb more vibration and keep the tripod steady under extreme weight, and that design prevents the legs from folding back.
Another noticeable aspect of the tripod is that the apex is tightened and loosened by a screw, which takes an allen key; some manufacturers use a lever or ratchet design to tighten the apex, while others have kept the simpler screw design. We've considered this part for a while, and decided to keep the screw function because:

the hex screw can be precisely adjusted
less moving parts, less things to go wrong
a lever requires regular adjustment 
it can be over-tightened, or flipped open by accident
it only takes slightly more time to use the allen key as it would a lever


The tripod includes heavy-duty integrated steel spiked feet with rubber-foot screw covers; simply unscrew and remove the rubber feet to use the spikes.

 
What's Included With Your Tripod Purchase?
The central component to all the perks is, of course, the tripod. The tripod outfit includes:

Berlin 38.4 tripod
flat plate with hook
tool kit
tripod bag

All perks include these items, denoted by the ""38.4"" listed in each perk.

We supply a flat plate so you can start using your tripod right away. This aluminum flat plate includes the 3/8"" stud screw and is covered in our special cork/rubber material which provides superior protection against slippage; it won't dry out in the sun, or get slick in the rain. The bottom of the flat plate has a short centre post ending in a hook assembly. That means you'll be able to use the tripod at its minimum height of 8cm (3.14"") and still keep the flat plate attached. Three nylon-covered screws are countersunk to secure ball heads. We'll keep you updated on that as we finalize the design and production.

The tool kit includes:

3.0 allen key - for tightening apex, leg struts, and 3/8"" stud screw
1.3 allen key - for tightening smaller set screw and 1/4"" stud screw
one stud screw 1/4"" (3/8"" stud screw comes attached to flat plate)


We wanted a tripod bag that offers good protection and quick access to gear with a minimum of fuss, and we've sourced just such a carrying bag for the tripod. This conical padded tripod bag has enough room to hold the 38.4 tripod with a CB-58FTR ball head mounted, it's tough enough to last years under hard use, and it's comfortable to carry in the field. There's an adjustable strap for over-the-shoulder use, and the bag can be opened at the top only, if preferred, for quick access to the tripod. There are also carrying handles, and inside the bag is a small zippered pouch for carrying your tripod tool kit.
Now, let's talk bowls. Again.
We offer two accessory kits for your tripod: a bowl adapter with a levelling half-bowl, available in both 75mm and 100mm sizes. The leveling bowl and adapter are sold together and permit the use of a variety of photo and video heads for your tripod.

Once a bowl is attached, you're ready for anything. Ready for still. Ready for video & cinema. Ready for pano. Ready for macro. Ready for large format. Ready for ultra-large format. Ready for anything you want to do.
The levelling bowl does a great job of replacing a ball head in many situations. The levelling bowl gives 20˚ of movement in any direction, more than enough for many applications. It can easily handle 40kg of camera and lens as well, making it a great choice for multi-format shooters. It locks down solid and tight.
The bowl adapters are made from a solid piece of aluminum, CNC-machined to perfection, with holes drilled into them for lighter weight and to reduce friction.


If you opt for a perk that includes a ball head, your ball head will come with the Arca-compatible SRB-60 clamp installed. The SRB-60 clamp has a large tolerance for all widths of Arca-compatible plates, and is considered a universal clamp. Our highly-rated ball heads are solid, strong and don't creep in the slightest, meaning you can always count on them for critical work. Use the ball head and bowl together for maximum versatility and endless possibilities of precision positioning.
The bowl adapters, levelling bowls, ball heads and clamps, are also under warranty for 10 years.

Challenges
We've already eliminated many of the risks to you, the customer. We're finalizing the details for the flat plate assembly and levelling bowls, but otherwise, small-scale production of the Berlin 38.4 is ready to begin.

Support
If you have any questions of any kind related to the Berlin 38.4, please write us anytime. We answer emails pretty quickly, even if we're on the road.
Refunds
If you're not 100% satisfied with the Berlin 38.4, simply notify us and return it for a full refund within 14 days of receiving it. If you're not sure that you'll keep it, we ask that you try to keep it as new-looking as possible until you've decided. That's it.
Shipping the Perks
Orders will ship from Canada to any Paypal-verified US or Canada address. There is no duty to pay if you are in the US. But if it happens, let us know, and we'll re-imburse your Duty fees.
Shipping is extra and depending on the perk chosen, ranges from $24 to $34. Canadian and US customers pay the same shipping fees. We've arranged for special reduced shipping rates for North America using Purolator/UPS. All shipments will be by courier and will require a signature.
Contact me by email if you have any special requests, be it for shipping or for other FLM items not listed here. I'll make sure you get it.
Delivery Date
We estimate the delivery date to be roughly 8-10 weeks after the Indiegogo campaign ends, which takes us to late January/early February. But this is usually an extremely busy time for shipping companies and many supplier delays tend to occur around this time. The post-Xmas shipping season is very busy and causes unforeseen delays. It happened to us last year, which was the cause of one significant delay in shipping the CP26-Travel.
For this reason, I'm going to set a shipping date of February 15. This means that the tripods will ship from Canada to our supporters no later than February 15. 
If it can be done earlier, I'll certainly make it happen, but given the time of year and based on past experience, I'd like to have a little wiggle room.

Comments about our previous Indiegogo project, the CP26-Travel tripod:
""The FLM CP 26 travel tripod I received today is a high quality precision product with absolutely beautiful fit and finish. Many thanks !"" - Paul L., Indiegogo supporter
""If you want to enjoy the multiple benefits of using a tripod in any photographic situation, there’s no excuse not to have the FLM CP-26 with you all the time."" - Robert Rodriguez, Jr., photographer, teacher, reviewer
""The quality is really excellent! If someone had told me, I had never believed, that a tripod with 4 extractable leg-sections can be so stiff and stable!"" - Oliver W., Indiegogo supporter
""Just by unpacking and holding the tripod, I could immediately see the high levels of quality and precision which went into its design and manufacture."" - Dennis W., Indiegogo supporter
""Congratulations on producing such an outstanding product. Frankly, it is so sturdy that I am not sure why I would want to travel with my original FLM which is so outstanding unto itself."" - Jeffrey B., Indiegogo supporter

FAQs:
1. Can I use my Gitzo/Manfrotto/Induro/RRS, etc. accessories on the Berlin 38.4? The short answer is ""Yes, but..."". Here's the long answer: while we've tested the Berlin with some other brand's accessories, we have not done exhaustive tests to make sure all brands conform to the same shape and size for the apex. The Berlin 38.4 has an inner apex diameter of 84.9mm (85mm), so please make sure that if you already own, for example, a Gitzo center post from Series 4 or 5, that its plate will fit the Berlin's apex.
2. Why can't you ship to me in Europe/Asia/Australia? This campaign is a US/Canada initiative, Europe and Asia-Pacific are not our distribution territories. In the near future, this tripod may be available in other territories as well. As Canada/US distributors, we cannot sell FLM gear outside of North America.
3. Who can buy the tripod? Anyone can buy the tripod, but we need either a US or Canada shipping address, verified through Paypal or through your credit card.
4. Why is this only an FLM Canada/USA project? In order to gauge whether the Berlin 38.4 will become a regular catalogue item, we will test it in North America first. Based on Indiegogo interest, peer and user reviews, we will either continue making it, or produce for existing orders, then only make a small run once a year of about 3-5 tripods. FLM Germany are not involved at this stage.
5. Do you offer the same warranty as before? Absolutely, yes. We offer FLM's standard 10-year warranty. Parts and repair are in Canada, same as always.
6. What is your refund/return policy? If you aren't 100% impressed by the 38.4, contact us and send back your tripod for a full refund. We'll give you 15 days from the date of delivery to decide. All we ask is that if you're not sure about the tripod, please try to keep it looking new and scratch-free.
7. What if I have a problem with my new tripod? Call or write us; if needed, we'll ask that you send us the problem part, or the whole tripod. We'll take care of the problem within 48 hours. If it can't be repaired quickly, we'll issue you a new tripod.
8. Do you have a US address for sending repairs? Yes, but response time will be slower. Contact us ahead of time and we'll send you the US shipping address.
9. Are replacement parts going to be made available? Not for general sale at stores, but replacement parts can be ordered from FLM Canada, and they're free if it's the result of a manufacturing flaw.
10. Can I ask you any question, anytime, about the Berlin 38.4 tripod or other FLM gear? Yes, absolutely!",23.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p><strong><i>The best camera is the one you have with you.</i></strong></p>
<p>I’m Marc Serota, and I’m the founder of <strong>Polaroid University</strong>. I’ve been a pro photographer for 30 years, covering the raw, awesome power of nature, the history of our world, and the triumph and agony of sports. I earned my fair share of awards and recognition, but I really like teaching about photography.</p>

<p>In the next year, millions of photos will be taken on smartphones. I started <strong>Polaroid University</strong> to teach people how to make great photos and videos on their smartphones and tablets. The smartphone is the most popular type of consumer camera, in the hands of billions of photographers. So, to reach the greatest number of photographers, I chose to focus on the smartphone.

<h3>Brand Power</h3>

<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our goal to raise $15,000. Whether or not we achieve our goal, after we pay our expenses (production, shipping, etc.), the net proceeds will go back into the business.</p>
<p><strong>1. We will make more episodes</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, we will re-invest in producing new “On the Road” episodes, which is a destination-focused series of episodes in which we travel to iconic places around the globe, shoot some great photography, and also meet some of the people that make those places special. It’s like Anthony Bourdain with a camera. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We plan for the “On the Road” episodes to be about 7-10 minutes long, and we will be able to produce up to 10 episodes for $10,000.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">2. We will make an Android app</span></strong></p>
<p>The other $5,000 will be devoted to developing, testing, and some marketing for our Android app. We’ve already developed an iOS app that has been rapidly evolving, and now has the ability to add, extend, and upgrade memberships, and supports purchasing individual episodes. We’ll produce an Android app that is feature-comparable (as much as possible) with the iOS app. We’ll test it, and launch it on Google Play.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of our backers (e.g., <strong>Trial Membership</strong> and above) get full access to all of our episodes. They are videos that take you from the very basics like composition and lighting and take you all the way to pro-level topics like digital rights and business management.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481133940/xvy1dofk81n4gifb2tmc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our premium perk is a <strong>Lifetime Membership</strong> to Polaroid University. This membership never expires and entitles the member to unlimited access to all Polaroid University episodes forever.</p>
<p>With the <strong>Annual Members Digital</strong> perk, you get a full year of unlimited access, plus any new episodes we release over the next year. Our plans call for over 100 episodes by this time next year, so this is the best way to get stay up-to-date with all of our latest content.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481134120/jljr7sllbeo09mwoooyb.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Opt for the <strong>Annual Membership Box</strong> perk, and get a real-life physical product in meatspace. It’s the coolest retro experience to wait for a package in the snailmail and physically scratch off a Membership card. It’s like a lottery ticket that you’re guaranteed to win!</p>
<p>Choose a <strong>Crew Member T-Shirt</strong> perk, and sneak on to the set of a Polaroid University production with our authentic crew member t-shirt. 100% cotton, with a contrasting monochromatic logo, featuring the iconic Polaroid Pixel. Your choice of color and size. So far, only crew and cast have these, so they're pretty rare in the wild.</p>
<p>Why not go for a <strong>Dry-Fit Jersey</strong> perk? Synthetic dry-fit material is favored by pro photographers everywhere comfort, breathability, and protection from sun and wind is important. Our version includes bold Polaroid University graphics, including the iconic Polaroid pixel.</p>
<p>Our on-camera talent, photo pros, and guests wear the <strong>Instructor Polo</strong>, which made from dry-fit material and features an embroidered Polaroid University logo.</p>
<p>Fans can select the <strong>Annual Membership + Crew Shirt</strong> perk to get a Crew Member T-Shirt and a premium membership, the <strong>Annual Membership + Dry-Fit Jersey</strong>, or the <strong>Annual Membership +  Instructor Polo</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481168010/n4ui6nnporkyj6rqggyr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>The Product</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn smartphone photography from pro photographers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digital download access code or a physical gift box</strong></li>
<li><strong>Video lessons are organized for learning in a logical order</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve got over 3.5 hours of professional-led, professionally-produced video instruction that is geared toward smartphone photographers, but is based on proper photographic principles like composition and lighting. Over the past year, we’ve completed our initial rounds of production, resulting in 40 episodes in our shipping our product today, and as we add more episodes, members get access to those as well.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481141009/qkfmz1gal0tfwq5jqvda.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With virtually no paid marketing, hundreds of people have already purchased an Annual Membership at Polaroid University. The primary source of these new members is the website, but since introducing the iOS app a couple of months ago, we’ve seen a great conversion rate among our iOS-using members.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481136070/vqr7risp5ukebwln0uuo.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>We’ve been focused on getting our video production process to be as cost-effective as possible, including concept, scriptwriting, filming, post production, and distribution. We offer entertaining photography instruction at a higher quality than most other paid online courses.</p>
<p>The main way people watch our paid content is on our website, <a href=""https://polaroiduniversity.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://polaroiduniversity.com</a>. Some watch episodes on their iOS devices, which uses the same membership database, so Members’ episodes are simultaneously available on all platforms. It will be that way for the Android app too.</p>
<p>Our members are mostly from the US, but we’ve been successful internationally as well, particularly in English-speaking countries, but also in Spanish-speaking countries and in Europe where the Polaroid brand is especially well regarded. Some of these members joined at the very beginning, when the number of episodes was just a fraction of what it is now. It is also notable that not one of our paid members has requested a refund or even contacted us with any complaint about the quality or content of the episodes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481146675/zelsa8oqpvhhqxzpbjji.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Product Status: SHIPPING!</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481258413/opbdzsfzy427cndlfdn9.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>To support our efforts in the retail space, we’ve produced <i>15 t</i><i>housand retail boxes</i>, which are in our warehouse, ready to ship. Those boxes include a membership card with a unique scratch-off code that can be activated on our website or through the Polaroid University iPhone app (Android app is coming soon).</p>
<p>It is these boxes that we will offer as part of several of our perks in they campaign, and all non-apparel (e.g., box-only) perks will ship <i>within days</i> of the end of this campaign.</p>
<p>The t-shirts, jerseys, and polos are sourced from our US suppliers, and will be shipped as soon as possible, but no more than a month after the end of the campaign. We’ve worked with all of our apparel suppliers before on multiple projects, and we’ve worked with these suppliers in the past to produce these same t-shirts, jerseys, and polos.</p>
<h3>Say What? Selling digital downloads in Retail?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481136424/sfj9bvckdm6b048oxy25.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We’re pursuing a slightly<i> unusual retail strategy</i>, especially for an online company producing digital content: we’ve produced a retail product. Our retail product is an Annual Membership in box. The box includes a heavy-stock card that has a scratch-off that reveals a unique membership id and membership code. Memberships can be activated on the website or in the iOS app.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481136617/eutlyyaoswefz2g5hw8e.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>We’re actively exploring relationships with several nationwide US retailers, and our strategy calls for us to be in national (US) retail by the second quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>We’ve also begun selling Polaroid University Annual Memberships on Amazon and we’ve implemented an automatic fulfillment system for digital memberships using the Amazon API. Currently, we’re working to achieve the Buy Box, which becomes available once Amazon detects a level of interest in the product. Our plans for 2017 include getting the Buy Box on our Amazon product page, and eventually to enter the Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA) program.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There’s little risk if you’re happy with getting a full program that teaches you smartphone photography and shows you how to apply that knowledge in real world situations. We’ve produced that, and hundreds of people are enjoying their Polaroid University episodes today. We have the physical product in our warehouse, and we’re poised to ship to our backers as soon as this campaign ends.</p>
<p><strong>OK, there's some risk...</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481145719/aua5luykf423teear4zk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our backers face a slight risk that we will not be able to produce the sixty episodes we planned for 2017. There are various reasons why we might not reach this goal, but the primary one is that we do not obtain the additional funding we need to meet our production goals. Right now, we’re planning on getting some of that funding from our retail and online sales. Additionally, some funding will come from debt we may issue, and some may come from an equity-based capital raise.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal for this campaign, we risk not being able to produce the number of “On the Road” episodes we planned, and we might not be able to devote the funds needed to build, test and market the Android app.</p>
<p>As far as the core knowledge, skills, and abilities required for success, our team has already proven that we can execute our core business (i.e. make and distribute videos). Over the next year, we will continue executing our core business, and expand our library of episodes, which will drive both physical/retail and digital sales.</p>

Choose a Crew Member T-Shirt perk, and sneak on to the set of a Polaroid University production with our authentic crew member t-shirt. 100% cotton, with a contrasting monochromatic logo, featuring the iconic Polaroid Pixel. Your choice of color and size. So far, only crew and cast have these, so they're pretty rare in the wild.
Why not go for a Dry-Fit Jersey perk? Synthetic dry-fit material is favored by pro photographers everywhere comfort, breathability, and protection from sun and wind is important. Our version includes bold Polaroid University graphics, including the iconic Polaroid pixel.
Our on-camera talent, photo pros, and guests wear the Instructor Polo, which made from dry-fit material and features an embroidered Polaroid University logo.
Fans can select the Annual Membership + Crew Shirt perk to get a Crew Member T-Shirt and a premium membership, the Annual Membership + Dry-Fit Jersey, or the Annual Membership +  Instructor Polo.


The Product

Learn smartphone photography from pro photographers
Digital download access code or a physical gift box
Video lessons are organized for learning in a logical order

We’ve got over 3.5 hours of professional-led, professionally-produced video instruction that is geared toward smartphone photographers, but is based on proper photographic principles like composition and lighting. Over the past year, we’ve completed our initial rounds of production, resulting in 40 episodes in our shipping our product today, and as we add more episodes, members get access to those as well.

With virtually no paid marketing, hundreds of people have already purchased an Annual Membership at Polaroid University. The primary source of these new members is the website, but since introducing the iOS app a couple of months ago, we’ve seen a great conversion rate among our iOS-using members.
We’ve been focused on getting our video production process to be as cost-effective as possible, including concept, scriptwriting, filming, post production, and distribution. We offer entertaining photography instruction at a higher quality than most other paid online courses.
The main way people watch our paid content is on our website, https://polaroiduniversity.com. Some watch episodes on their iOS devices, which uses the same membership database, so Members’ episodes are simultaneously available on all platforms. It will be that way for the Android app too.
Our members are mostly from the US, but we’ve been successful internationally as well, particularly in English-speaking countries, but also in Spanish-speaking countries and in Europe where the Polaroid brand is especially well regarded. Some of these members joined at the very beginning, when the number of episodes was just a fraction of what it is now. It is also notable that not one of our paid members has requested a refund or even contacted us with any complaint about the quality or content of the episodes.

Product Status: SHIPPING!
To support our efforts in the retail space, we’ve produced 15 thousand retail boxes, which are in our warehouse, ready to ship. Those boxes include a membership card with a unique scratch-off code that can be activated on our website or through the Polaroid University iPhone app (Android app is coming soon).
It is these boxes that we will offer as part of several of our perks in they campaign, and all non-apparel (e.g., box-only) perks will ship within days of the end of this campaign.
The t-shirts, jerseys, and polos are sourced from our US suppliers, and will be shipped as soon as possible, but no more than a month after the end of the campaign. We’ve worked with all of our apparel suppliers before on multiple projects, and we’ve worked with these suppliers in the past to produce these same t-shirts, jerseys, and polos.
Say What? Selling digital downloads in Retail?

We’re pursuing a slightly unusual retail strategy, especially for an online company producing digital content: we’ve produced a retail product. Our retail product is an Annual Membership in box. The box includes a heavy-stock card that has a scratch-off that reveals a unique membership id and membership code. Memberships can be activated on the website or in the iOS app.
We’re actively exploring relationships with several nationwide US retailers, and our strategy calls for us to be in national (US) retail by the second quarter of 2017.
We’ve also begun selling Polaroid University Annual Memberships on Amazon and we’ve implemented an automatic fulfillment system for digital memberships using the Amazon API. Currently, we’re working to achieve the Buy Box, which becomes available once Amazon detects a level of interest in the product. Our plans for 2017 include getting the Buy Box on our Amazon product page, and eventually to enter the Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA) program.

Risks & Challenges
There’s little risk if you’re happy with getting a full program that teaches you smartphone photography and shows you how to apply that knowledge in real world situations. We’ve produced that, and hundreds of people are enjoying their Polaroid University episodes today. We have the physical product in our warehouse, and we’re poised to ship to our backers as soon as this campaign ends.
OK, there's some risk...

Our backers face a slight risk that we will not be able to produce the sixty episodes we planned for 2017. There are various reasons why we might not reach this goal, but the primary one is that we do not obtain the additional funding we need to meet our production goals. Right now, we’re planning on getting some of that funding from our retail and online sales. Additionally, some funding will come from debt we may issue, and some may come from an equity-based capital raise.
If we do not reach our goal for this campaign, we risk not being able to produce the number of “On the Road” episodes we planned, and we might not be able to devote the funds needed to build, test and market the Android app.
As far as the core knowledge, skills, and abilities required for success, our team has already proven that we can execute our core business (i.e. make and distribute videos). Over the next year, we will continue executing our core business, and expand our library of episodes, which will drive both physical/retail and digital sales.

You only buy what you need. No unnecessary parts required. <br/>•    Although each lens is not able to shoot in 4K format, we consider that an amateur camera doesn’t need this. If included it would have an impact of the price. <br/>•    With all cameras working together a 4K image is achieved. But if each camera separately made an image of that format it would be very heavy to transfer all data online or to upload to the cloud through LTE module. Along with that, saving the data on a flash drive would take large amounts of memory.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

<p><br/><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><font><strong><u>What are the aims, objectives and prospects of TTcam ?</u></strong><br/>Since the invention of cinematography only the quality of the image has changed… but now it’s time to move away from “tunnel-frame” viewing that’s actually unnatural for humans - and switch to a new level of optical perception. <br/>With the development of internet-based technologies a true breakthrough is not far off. We, and our like-minded people want to be in leading positions… we know what we need and to what we want. <br/>We decided to make a 360 camera better than anything on the market, so we set to work to push the technology to make the best. <br/>The shortcomings of previous cameras have been taken into consideration. <br/>TTcam is not one more expensive toy or the next needless gadget! We’ve created a comparatively inexpensive, robust, multi-function modular 360 camera. <br/>To get a glimpse of the future, we’re creating a whole new sector of software and technological products. We are constantly developing and adjusting TTcam to improve and enhance all possible VR services.

</div><div> </div></div>","The all-new TTcam provides a smooth, continuous system of unique removable modules allowing the camera to be used in virtually any conditions and under any circumstances:
Whether you’re shooting a fast action sports game - or capturing perfect images and footage for security surveillance at home or at work, this unique system gives you the results you want.
The camera also has infinite settings to allow variable viewing angles to suite all circumstance in a range of 360°-180°-90° 
 



 

 

With High-quality image stabilization, 60 fps, 4K resolution, simultaneous recording function from all lenses, and unique preset settings - breathtaking shooting, regardless of the operator’s skills, is guaranteed.
We understand how important it is for you to meet the challenge of creating great video and perfect still images that will bring pleasure time after time.
 

The camera control is intuitive.  

 


 

The TTcam’s design is based on a pyramid of equilateral triangles (tetrahedron) with three 180° lenses capable of capturing 360° horizontally and nearly 320° vertically. It also has an additional (optional) modular assembly providing circular panoramic view of 360° x 360°.

Simple modular construction makes the camera easy to use and maintain.
The camera enclosure is made of shockproof plastic material with colour-matched components of black and white.
Around the perimeter of camera there is an RGB-LED backlight (red-green-blue indication) changing frequency and colour depending on operational status of the device.

 
Below you will find the TTcam’s key technical features, which distinguish it from ordinary cameras:​


 

 

 

Our specially designed TTcam software is able to perform a great number of tasks.
Images from the TTcam can be displayed on screen in separate windows as well as being immediately integrated into one picture allowing you to create panoramic view in online mode.
The control of camera parameters is also performed through the program. You can move a panoramic view by using a computer mouse, directional keys on keyboard or a touch screen.
      The software compatibility with iOS, Windows OS and Android platforms make it easy to use with tablet PC or smart phone.
The standard version of the TTcam program contains the necessary number of image and control settings. Extended versions of the program have wider functionality for professional use.
Multiplex mode

product development


The program is simple and easy to use. It allows users to switch the camera over several preset modes by categories, automatically setting it to a required operational mode including: Automobile, Security, Sport, and Creative Activity etc.
Supported languages include: English, German and Russian (other languages pending).
TTcam has the capability of allowing the use of existing simple to understand standard free operations, plus paid, and conditionally paid, compatible programs for creating, editing, processing and viewing photo and video panoramas.
For example: Kolor Autopano, PTGui Pro, Panoweaver, krpano and others.

What makes our camera fundamentally distinct from all the others ?Major distinguishing features of TTcam are: •    Ergonomic, pyramidal design providing stability even on rough or uneven surfaces.•    Flexibility due to its adaptive modules for use in a multitude of conditions for just about any purpose. •    Shooting at any viewing angle 360°-270°-180°-90° and technical properties robust enough to withstand mechanical damage. •    Full function capability though the use of cost effective modules. You only buy what you need. No unnecessary parts required. •    Although each lens is not able to shoot in 4K format, we consider that an amateur camera doesn’t need this. If included it would have an impact of the price. •    With all cameras working together a 4K image is achieved. But if each camera separately made an image of that format it would be very heavy to transfer all data online or to upload to the cloud through LTE module. Along with that, saving the data on a flash drive would take large amounts of memory.
Why each lens of the camera is not able to shoot in 4K format ?We consider that an amateur camera doesn’t need this. This would lead to unreasonable increase of price. All the cameras together make 4K image. But if each camera separately made an image of that format it would be very heavy to transfer all data online or to upload them in cloud storage through LTE module. Along with that, saving the data on a flash drive would take large amounts of memory.
What is the impact of a sudden power outage on the camera ?If, for example, the camera works for video surveillance and is permanently connected through a power-line - in the event of a complete power outage the camera continues functioning for about 1,5 hours maintaining security.How can I order TTcam and additional modules and where can it be delivered ?You can order the camera and/or one of the additional modules in one of three colours. Check the website at the “PRODUCT” section. The delivery can be made to any point of the world that you indicate.
Do I pay for delivery ?No, delivery is part of our service. Another unique element to buying the new TTcam.
What are the aims, objectives and prospects of TTcam ?Since the invention of cinematography only the quality of the image has changed… but now it’s time to move away from “tunnel-frame” viewing that’s actually unnatural for humans - and switch to a new level of optical perception. With the development of internet-based technologies a true breakthrough is not far off. We, and our like-minded people want to be in leading positions… we know what we need and to what we want. We decided to make a 360 camera better than anything on the market, so we set to work to push the technology to make the best. The shortcomings of previous cameras have been taken into consideration. TTcam is not one more expensive toy or the next needless gadget! We’ve created a comparatively inexpensive, robust, multi-function modular 360 camera. To get a glimpse of the future, we’re creating a whole new sector of software and technological products. We are constantly developing and adjusting TTcam to improve and enhance all possible VR services. As we find solutions we’ll create the products.
What kind of photos can I make with my TTcam ?In photo mode the camera is able to make both ordinary high-quality and panoramic photos, which can be printed onto photo regular paper if you wish. Also you can stop the video footage at any frame (locked picture) and save it as a photo, rather like a screen shot
Is TTcam waterproof ?The camera itself is deliberately not a waterproof device to avoid overheating in normal use. For use in water, we’ve created separate special waterproof protective cases made of strong plastic.  

How long can I shoot on a full charge of TTcam battery ?Battery life depends on the mode chosen for video shooting. The average batter time on continuous use, on one full charge, is 1,5-2,5 hours.
Is it possible to return the product after purchase ?If you find any of the features of TTcam unsuited (colour, size, weight, assemblage and other) we are ready to provide a full refund within 14 days after receipt as long as TTcam is returned in original condition with original packaging intact.
Can I choose the colour of my TTcam ?You may choose from 2 colours: White or Black.
I’m a member of the media/press, how can I reach the TTcam team ?For media inquiries please use the ‘Contact Us’ form on the website. For Press photos and logos, please send your request by e-mail.
Where is TTcam made ?The TTcam is engineered in Russia. We have several industrial partners located in Asia, and have also identified several manufacturing partners in Europe and Canada who are capable of assembling the TTcam for us. However, at this stage, the final decision has not been made.
Can I purchase several cameras in bulk ?We have a pre-order web page on our site. If your request is urgent, please do not hesitate to contact us at Tripletcam.com
What is your warranty ?We offer 1 year warranty on TTcam.

I am a husband, a father to 3 boys, and most importantly a United States Marine Corps Veteran. My former Marine Corps roommate (Mike Lose) had a great idea and decided to share it with me and we’ll get to that in a minute. Mike and I have been discharged from active duty for about 16yrs. Which essentially means we haven't seen our brothers face to face since the day we were discharged. One of the things that make veterans special is that it doesn't matter the amount of time spent apart, when we reconnect it's as if we haven't missed a day. I know this because of the times that I have spoken with a few guys over the phone and ended up talking for well over an hour without missing a beat!<br/>    Now to Mikes idea, it is to get in the car and drive across the country hitting as many cities and towns that we can where people that we served with live. The objective of this trip is to not only see as many people as possible but to also not sleep in a hotel. With this trip not being a vacation but more like a marathon, it means there will be many miles covered. There will be some guys that we will just stop in and have lunch with in which they will be paying for since we drove all this way. Then it’s back on the road to get to where we will be sleeping for the night. While at the house that we sleep at, this guy will provide our dinner meal for us. We aren't looking for handouts, we are just letting our brothers take care of us along the way. I know both Mike and I would do the same if someone came through our hometowns. Thats just what Marines do…. we take care of each other.<br/>    Once Mike introduced this idea to me my production mindset kicked in and I couldn't help but think about how I could document this trip and produce a very cool short documentary or even a short series. It’s right up my alley since that’s what I do for a living. I have worked in Television for about 15 years as well as serve as a director of photography for a full video production company that I own with a friend. While serving in the Marines I bought my first camera and I would always have it in hand and recording at all times. So it will only make sense to these guys when they see us pulling up and I have a camera in my hand getting the shot! I plan on mounting my 4 Go Pro’s inside and sometimes outside of the car for some driving footage. Mike has also been informed by myself that there will be times that I will need to fly my drone along our path while we drive. It will be important to see us driving along the road or seeing any big city that we may be entering as well as seeing that we may just be in the middle of nowhere.          With all of this production in mind I decided to create a Facebook page which we have just over 200 likes at this point. The page can be shared with as many people as possible and they can follow us along our journey. I will be editing short videos to post daily and update people so that they can almost keep up with us in realtime.     This is a story of bringing veterans together that haven't seen each other in 16 years. That in itself is a big deal. What rounds everything out is upon the completion of our trip I will only have a few days before I make my way down to Parris Island SC. to watch my oldest son walk across the parade deck and graduate from Marine Corps Bootcamp. This will bring my trip full circle and round out nicely for the completion of everything. It will also be 20yrs to almost the exact day that I was there graduating. It wasn’t planned that way at all but he will graduate on February 10th 2017 and I graduated on February 7th. 1997.     What we are trying to do is get some  funding/backing to take this trip to the next level. The big picture of OPERATION RECONNECT is to make this a series so that other veterans can apply to be on the show and take their own journey across the country and see their buddies. With every different group there will be different guys, cities and stories. There will also be veterans of different branches of the military being featured from show to show.  Right now our trip is only 8 days and about half way through the country. If the funding goes above what we are asking then we would be able to make the addition of another 7 days and we would be able to make if from coast to coast. Also stopping in on about 8 to 10 more guys. What I can guarantee is that you would be helping to reconnect veterans. This is going to be an epic trip one way or another. I just thought it would be great if we were able to get some support to help take this idea and make it something bigger than what we initially thought it to be.<br/>    Thank you for taking the time to read over the document. This will be an exciting trip and one for the ages!<br/>Thank you<br/>#HelpReconnectVets<br/>Sincerely, Matthew Dudley &amp; Mike Lose</p></div>","My name is Matthew Dudley.

Following the huge success of the Pinhole Pro and Pinhole Pro S Series, we were super excited to debut our latest Pinhole prime lens addition – Pinhole Pro X at the The Photography Show in the UK. Pinhole Pro X 18-36mm is the world's first ever pinhole zoom lens, bolstering our line-up of professional pinhole primes, designed specifically for video production and art photography.

<p>The Nano Tornado was designed to accommodate a number of different cameras. We’ve built camera housings for both the Polaroid Cube camera and a live feed (5.8GHz) camera.  The camera sits far enough forward that even with a wide angle panoramic view, you never see legs or blades in your video – unlike essentially every “open blade” drone on the market.</p>

<p>The Nano Tornado team has been working on ducted fan flyers for several years, and the four rotor Nano-T concept since August 2014.

The core development team has extensive experience from spacecraft and NASA-related projects over the last couple of decades, including working on missions to Mars and Venus.</p>
<p>We know from prior projects that slips can be significant, especially in manufacturing. We try very hard to mitigate these problems by doing this a little different from some crowd funded projects. First, we intentionally worked much deeper through the development cycle for Nano Tornado before releasing it on Indiegogo. Second, we have established a deeper and large team of engineers across the range of required disciplines required for Nano Tornado a year ago. Third, we have spread development risk over several different projects. Finally, we have developed deep relationships with our plastics, PCB, and motor vendors.</p>
<p>We have also tried to set realistic delivery deadlines. Getting very deep into the development cycle before launching this campaign is a big part of that, but there always remains the desire to set ""success oriented schedules"": If everything works great, we could ship sooner! While we want you to get your Nano Tornados as soon as possible, we know from our prior fabrication experiences that things will go wrong along the way. Quality is always the first thing to suffer in these cases.

And using a light meter hasn’t changed either - it has always been a very inefficient process.  The photographer carries the meter into the set, takes a measurement, and then returns to fiddle with the lights or camera. And repeat. With all the advances in sensor technology and electronic design, we felt that smartphone infrastructure could be harnessed to create a new, breakthrough meter design that delivers accurate measurements with incredibly improved productivity as well.</p><p>We took that idea to photographers and filmmakers to learn more about their needs.  We brainstormed and devised a truly unique light meter.  </p><ul>
<li>We included features that would help the photographer get the right exposure and white balance faster – improving productivity on the set and reducing editing time spent fixing exposure and color issues.</li>
<li>We made the meter measure light and color, avoiding the need to buy two separate devices.</li>
<li>We separated the light sensor from the controls and display, and then replaced the controls &amp; display with a device everyone already carries - a smartphone.  That made the meter smaller, lower cost, and more convenient.</li>
<li>We also developed one of the best reasons for photographers to own a smartwatch - providing light and color readings right to your wrist.  That leaves your hands free to adjusts lights, carry your camera, interact with the talent, or whatever else you need to do.  Now the meter can even watch the light while you’re busy, warning you when something important changes.  </li>
</ul><p>The result of all this work is the Illuminati Meter: a compact device for measuring light and color.  But it really functions as your lighting assistant – helping you be more productive, more engaged with your subject. That allows you to concentrate on creating beautiful images.</p><p>Whether you create moving or still images the Illuminati light and color meter helps you measure the light in your scene – all kinds of light - efficiently and accurately. The small, lightweight meter is controlled by your smartphone using the Illuminati meter app which will be available for both Apple iOS and Android phones. Color temperature and exposure readings are transmitted from the meter to your smartphone using Bluetooth wireless technology. If you have a smartwatch paired with your smartphone, the meter readings show up there as well for a hands-free metering experience.</p><p>The meter measures exposure and color temperature from continuous sources such as LEDs, halogen, HMI, and, of course, the sun. It also measures strobes, giving you the correct exposure and color temperature - and it will even measure strobe duration. It also has a strobe + ambient mode to help you balance the exposure and also the color of the light. You can also connect multiple Illuminati meters to your smartphone and monitor multiple light simultaneously.</p><p>The illuminati light and color meter also offers several convenient mounting options including a ¼-20 socket, a lanyard channel, and a rare-earth magnet on the back which can be used with to mount the meter directly to metal objects, or with the set of Illuminati magnetic mounting attachments.</p><p>This is the first time all these features have been available in a light metering product at such an attractive price: $249 + shipping on Indiegogo right now.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495294246/xudltxlhyzxpmrni3yws.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We’re dedicated to advancing your ability to make your vision come to life with simple, powerful imaging and exposure measurement tools. The Illuminati Wireless Meter is designed to be the most versatile light and color meter ever available. We plan to keep expanding its capabilities beyond the initial release with new app features and firmware updates. This is one gadget you won’t want to leave behind.</p><p>If you want to master photography to capture your life, adventures, or for your profession, you need to get your color and exposure right. To get those really great photos, you have to stop shooting under just the ambient light, and really take control. You can't rely on your camera’s automatic options to give the look you want. The Illuminati meter gives all the information you, the modern creator, needs. We save you time and give you the confidence to focus on what matters–your vision.</p><p>We hope you agree, and want to join us in the pursuit of amazing photos and video. Continue reading to discover all the features and capabilities of the Illuminati Meter, as well as technical specifications. You can also watch some helpful demo videos made by our team and pro-photographers who’ve had the chance to beta test the meter.

Stop wasting valuable time running between lights or scene locations.</p><p>You can even use your smartwatch to trigger the meters remotely, monitor readings constantly and receive critical notifications about exposure or color shifts.

And using a light meter hasn’t changed either - it has always been a very inefficient process.  The photographer carries the meter into the set, takes a measurement, and then returns to fiddle with the lights or camera. And repeat. With all the advances in sensor technology and electronic design, we felt that smartphone infrastructure could be harnessed to create a new, breakthrough meter design that delivers accurate measurements with incredibly improved productivity as well.We took that idea to photographers and filmmakers to learn more about their needs.  We brainstormed and devised a truly unique light meter.  
We included features that would help the photographer get the right exposure and white balance faster – improving productivity on the set and reducing editing time spent fixing exposure and color issues.
We made the meter measure light and color, avoiding the need to buy two separate devices.
We separated the light sensor from the controls and display, and then replaced the controls & display with a device everyone already carries - a smartphone.  That made the meter smaller, lower cost, and more convenient.
We also developed one of the best reasons for photographers to own a smartwatch - providing light and color readings right to your wrist.  That leaves your hands free to adjusts lights, carry your camera, interact with the talent, or whatever else you need to do.  Now the meter can even watch the light while you’re busy, warning you when something important changes.  
The result of all this work is the Illuminati Meter: a compact device for measuring light and color.  But it really functions as your lighting assistant – helping you be more productive, more engaged with your subject. That allows you to concentrate on creating beautiful images.Whether you create moving or still images the Illuminati light and color meter helps you measure the light in your scene – all kinds of light - efficiently and accurately. The small, lightweight meter is controlled by your smartphone using the Illuminati meter app which will be available for both Apple iOS and Android phones. Color temperature and exposure readings are transmitted from the meter to your smartphone using Bluetooth wireless technology. If you have a smartwatch paired with your smartphone, the meter readings show up there as well for a hands-free metering experience.The meter measures exposure and color temperature from continuous sources such as LEDs, halogen, HMI, and, of course, the sun. It also measures strobes, giving you the correct exposure and color temperature - and it will even measure strobe duration. It also has a strobe + ambient mode to help you balance the exposure and also the color of the light. You can also connect multiple Illuminati meters to your smartphone and monitor multiple light simultaneously.The illuminati light and color meter also offers several convenient mounting options including a ¼-20 socket, a lanyard channel, and a rare-earth magnet on the back which can be used with to mount the meter directly to metal objects, or with the set of Illuminati magnetic mounting attachments.This is the first time all these features have been available in a light metering product at such an attractive price: $249 + shipping on Indiegogo right now.We’re dedicated to advancing your ability to make your vision come to life with simple, powerful imaging and exposure measurement tools. The Illuminati Wireless Meter is designed to be the most versatile light and color meter ever available. We plan to keep expanding its capabilities beyond the initial release with new app features and firmware updates. This is one gadget you won’t want to leave behind.If you want to master photography to capture your life, adventures, or for your profession, you need to get your color and exposure right. To get those really great photos, you have to stop shooting under just the ambient light, and really take control. You can't rely on your camera’s automatic options to give the look you want. The Illuminati meter gives all the information you, the modern creator, needs. We save you time and give you the confidence to focus on what matters–your vision.We hope you agree, and want to join us in the pursuit of amazing photos and video. Continue reading to discover all the features and capabilities of the Illuminati Meter, as well as technical specifications. You can also watch some helpful demo videos made by our team and pro-photographers who’ve had the chance to beta test the meter. Finally, read what the media has to say about Illuminati Meter.If you have any questions or comments, be sure to contact us. We’re excited to bring our product to you and can’t wait to see how it helps photographers and videographers around the world. ""Light makes photography. Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light. Know it for all you are worth, and you will know the key to photography.""  — George Eastman Illuminati Meter plus Android Phone (iOS available, too!) The Illuminati meter is the world's first Bluetooth light and color meter that works wirelessly with smartphones.  Traditional light meters combine the sensor and display into one bulky device.  The Illuminati meter discards all that extra weight and keeps only the most critical parts.  Small and wireless, you place the Illuminati meter anywhere in your scene.  It sends readings in real time to your phone or smartwatch while you are free to stay behind your camera or adjust lights.The Illuminati meter can also continuously monitor the ambient lighting and color. User-programmable alarms will warn you if the brightness changes because of a cloud floating overhead or the color temperature changes during the golden hour. Always know your lighting and get more good shots under changing conditions.The Illuminati meter is also the first system to let you use multiple sensors simultaneously. You can meter foregrounds and backgrounds, set strobe ratios, or monitor and manage multiple light sources (including flash!) or large areas at the same time. Stop wasting valuable time running between lights or scene locations.You can even use your smartwatch to trigger the meters remotely, monitor readings constantly and receive critical notifications about exposure or color shifts. You can get readings continuously without ever having to take out your phone or put your camera down. We’re first to do that, too!Best of all, it’s simple to use and small. Check it out:(Anatomy of an Illuminati meter) No sweat. Here is a video we made in our office in Santa Clara, CA.Tech Specs

We solved a bunch of real-world problems for visual artists, content-creators and professionalsAuto White Balance (AWB) Doesn’t Always Work(Left: Too cool, Center: Neutral, Right: Too warm)Letting the camera decide how to set white balance might sound convenient.  But when it fails, you get bad skin tones, inaccurate colors, and even different colors shot-to-shot. Instead, use the Illuminati meter to get the light’s true color temperature and set white balance correctly. Leave automatic color mishaps behind.  Stop wasting time fixing it in Photoshop® or Lightroom® by getting it right before you press the shutter button.  Wrong Exposures in Tough Lighting Conditions(Left: Overexposed (lost highlights) Right: Properly exposed)Autoexposure works fine for typical scenes. Truly creative images aren’t typical. You have to control your camera, not the other way around. Subjects like a bride in a stunning white gown next to a groom in dark tuxedo, or a model backlit or under a spotlight can cause any camera to struggle.  Measuring the light falling on your subject (incident) instead of bouncing back to the camera (reflected), will let you always nail the exposure. First time, every time.Unnatural or Unexpected Colors when Mixing Lighting(Left: Daylight only, Middle: Daylight + Tungsten, Right: Daylight plus matched color balance)A shot ruined by mixed lighting can be almost impossible to fix when editing your RAW files. If your flash doesn’t match the ambient, you’re bound to get odd shadow colors. A fill light can ruin an otherwise gorgeous golden sunset.  Use the Illuminati meter’s strobe and ambient color measuring to match your strobes to the ambient and avoid mixed color casts.  Scenes with multiple light sources or odd sources, like LEDs or fluorescent lights, can also be problematic. Measure your sources separately with the Illuminati meter and instantly know how to filter or white balance to get the look you want.  You even can use multiple meters in your scene to do it even faster.We’re also including a GEL MODE in the app to help you choose the right color correction gels, even for hard-to-match lights like LEDs.Change HappensSometimes a cloud passes before the sun, or one of your flashes stops working. If you don’t know when it happens, you may have to reshoot the photos or just plain loose the shots.  Bummer.  Avoid that with up to 15 user-programmable alarm notifications.  The app can even automatically compare readings from several meters and send you warnings of color changes, color mismatch, or changes in relative brightness.  Your Time is MoneyWhen you’re a pro, all the time spent correcting images afterwards eats into your profit. Get each shot right and spend less time correcting exposure and color.(© Tony Corbell)Setting up Lighting Ratios  Know the exposure difference between your main light and fill or background light. Measure all of them and see the difference in f-stops. It’s easy and fast to set the same ratios up again anywhere.(© Tony Corbell)Stay in the FlowSetting and checking lighting during a photoshoot can detract from the energy between a photographer and her model or clients.  Avoid those, “Hold on a sec, I have to check the lighting…” moments by having the answers in your pocket or on your wrist.  You can also quietly ask assistants to go make adjustments since you already know what to fix!  Level up as Director of PhotographyWith multiple Illuminati meters on the set, you can be behind the camera or in the video village while working with your gaffers to craft the lighting. Be the Best Gaffer on Set  If you’re handling the lights and the DP calls for adjustments for a light in an awkward place (happens, right?), you can place your meter in the sweet spot and clamber up to the light to make changes and see the results on your phone or watch.  Gel the light, adjust the power or adjust the color temperature–you’ll get all the right info, faster.Change HappensSave Time when Color Grading   When the editing is done and you’re grading your footage, you’ll appreciate the exposure and colors all being in the right place. Don’t lose any highlights or shadows to something you could have fixed on set. Measure now with Illuminati meters and spend less time gnashing your teeth during color grading.Rapid Green Screen IlluminationA badly lit green screen won’t mask out properly.  Using a grid of Illuminati meters in front of your green screen lets you get behind the lights and adjust them while seeing the results in Continuous Mode in the palm of your hand. The LEDs on the meters will show you which areas are too bright or too dark. When all the meters glow green, you’re good to go.Matching and Correcting Light Sources  You’ve got many lights on your set. They may be rented and unknown, or from different manufacturers.  Plus, not all lights are made the same (or accurately report or display their color temperature).  On top of that, many bulbs drift color temperature over time with use. Phew!With the Illuminati meter, you will measure, know and correct all your light sources to match (or tailor to taste) before rolling camera. ​Measure the brightness of both ambient and strobe lighting
Measuring modes: Tv, Av, Sv, strobe ratio priority
Strobe-to-total ratio is how much of the light comes from the strobe

Software Development Kit (SDK)We are planning on releasing an SDK after our backers receive their rewards so that other innovative programmers and hardware developers can do fun and interesting things with the Illuminati Meter. We’re looking forward to what is possible when more minds apply their ideas and creativity in this space.“As many things have changed in the medium of photography, the one constant element has been light. The quality and color of light in a photograph is what gives meaning and definition to the activity. The direction is what gives the photograph a sense of time and moment, and critical is the difference between the light and shadow. The light meter is still one of the most important tools for creative photographers to use in making their work. The Illuminati meter gives the photographer more information than we have ever had, and ways to use that information that we have only dreamed about.”— Dennis Keeley, Chair at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA“I have been promoting the need for and importance of light meters for the past twenty years. Now for the first time, there is finally a new way to measure light and color that is affordable and accurate, with cutting edge technology. Illuminati is here and I for one will use it every day.""— Tony Corbell, Photographer/Lighting Evangelist“Finally, a photographer’s tool that will change the way you work and simplify precision control with color and exposure using your smart device… the Illuminati.

<p><i><strong>Team Nu Bear.</strong></i>  Nu Grip 4 in 1 is designed by husband and wife team, Richard and Basmah, who both studied Industrial Design and Technology at Loughborough University in the UK. They set up the Nu Bear design studio in 2017.</p>
<p>Together they have over 25 years of design experience and specialise in Industrial Design,  set and event design for a variety of different sectors, including Aviation, Film and Live Events. </p>
<p>Richard has designed aircraft interiors for both luxury and commercial aircraft. He has built a reputation for delivering conceptual design right through to viable working products.</p>
<p>Basmah crafted her skills in the design for Live Events and Film. She was part of the design team for the London 2012 Olympic Ceremonies and more recently has worked on the latest James Bond Film 'No Time to Die' (2020) and the Agatha Christie Films, 'Murder on the Orient Express' (2017) and 'Death on the Nile' (2020).</p>
<p>With a passion for travel, photography and the water, their idea for Nu Grip started over 2 years ago and they could see that no one else had thought of designing a 4 in 1 product for the action camera community. Instead of packing lots of different accessories, all you needed was 1 accessory. They have spent that time designing, prototyping, testing, and preparing it ready for production. </p>

“I’ve been using the Nu Grip for a couple of weeks and it instantly became my favorite mount. It’s perfect for any situation, whether you’re in or out of the water. Being an all-in-one selfie stick, grip, tripod, and floaty, it’s really the only camera accessory you need!” - Nick Hearn,

“I'm very happy to share a world preview of a new and wonderful product for your GoPro! Nu Grip 4in1 is a pole with 4 different functions in 1. It is an extendible pole, a tripod, a float and for the GoPro Max it is an invisible pole!” - Niko
  Accessorise. Nu Grip 4 in 1 is ideal for vlogging as it is very lightweight and super stable. You can easily mount a vlogging kit with a microphone and LED light.  We are conscious of the impact we are having on our oceans, especially the ever-increasing plastic waste and its devastating effect on marine wildlife. We want to be as socially responsible as we can with our product, packaging, and shipping.Nu Grip has been designed with this in mind and the product and its packaging are completely recyclable. We are minimising energy use from initial creation through to shipping. We are dedicated to engaging in an environment-friendly packaging production process, with no single-use plastics. We actively designed our packaging to omit plastic trays, clear plastic windows to display our product, plastic hanging tags, and vacuum-sealed packaging. All our packaging can be recycled. ​Of course, there is always more we can do, so we will constantly look at improving our design and manufacturing processes to minimise the environmental footprint. We are happy to announce that we have partnered with ONETREEPLANTED, an organisation focused on reforestation and are committing to planting one tree for every Nu Grip 4 in 1 we sell. We will also plant a tree for those who perhaps don't want to buy a Nu Grip but still want to contribute to the campaign.                


Design Development. We spent the last two years designing, developing and testing Nu Grip and getting crucial user feedback that helped us develop the product further. We started with concept sketches and then detailed CAD design drawings and then bought a 3D printer to create initial prototypes that we could physically hold and test. 
 

Early Prototypes.  Many prototypes were rigorously tested and given to the Action Camera community to gain valuable user feedback before finalising the design. 
                                
Engineering Drawings. 3D CAD Design.

Injection Mould Tools. Mould tools designed & manufactured and tested for mass production.

 


Team Nu Bear.  Nu Grip 4 in 1 is designed by husband and wife team, Richard and Basmah, who both studied Industrial Design and Technology at Loughborough University in the UK. They set up the Nu Bear design studio in 2017.
Together they have over 25 years of design experience and specialise in Industrial Design,  set and event design for a variety of different sectors, including Aviation, Film and Live Events. 
Richard has designed aircraft interiors for both luxury and commercial aircraft. He has built a reputation for delivering conceptual design right through to viable working products.
Basmah crafted her skills in the design for Live Events and Film. She was part of the design team for the London 2012 Olympic Ceremonies and more recently has worked on the latest James Bond Film 'No Time to Die' (2020) and the Agatha Christie Films, 'Murder on the Orient Express' (2017) and 'Death on the Nile' (2020).
With a passion for travel, photography and the water, their idea for Nu Grip started over 2 years ago and they could see that no one else had thought of designing a 4 in 1 product for the action camera community. Instead of packing lots of different accessories, all you needed was 1 accessory. They have spent that time designing, prototyping, testing, and preparing it ready for production.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Roader Time Machine Camera captures moments that occurred before you touch the record button. It is storing footage in its buffer memory for 10 seconds and flushes it constantly. Once you touch the camera, it creates a clip that stars <strong>10 seconds before</strong> you touched it, till <strong>10 seconds after</strong>. The 20 seconds clip is t<strong>hen automatically uploaded to your phone</strong>. Easy as that!</p>

<p>Most cameras give you only two options: record everything and spend hours editing the raw footage; or worse, <strong>miss that special moment</strong> because you can’t grab the camera fast enough. Not anymore.</p>
<p>Roader is storing video in a short time memory and does not record anything until you press the camera. When you press it, a video clip is saved that <strong>starts 10 seconds <u>back in time</u></strong>. Using the 10-second video that is stored in the short time memory and adding 10 seconds after you pressed the camera.</p>

<p>When Roader is powered on, it starts <strong>buffering video</strong> in its RAM memory. The image is stored for 10 seconds and it refreshes constantly. Only when you press the camera it saves a file out of its RAM memory (10 seconds) to the internal flash memory and it adds 10 seconds after the press.</p>
<div>The recording of 20 seconds (video+sound) is then <strong>automatically transferred to your phone via Bluetooth.</strong> Uploading the SD (Social Definition 720x540p) clip via Bluetooth takes approximately 10 seconds and you can <strong>immediately share</strong> your video from the Roader App to any social channel (like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Whatsapp, Wechat etc.) or store it in your camera roll.</div>
<p>Another recording of the same moment is stored on the camera in HD (1280x960) and ready to upload to your phone via WiFi when you choose to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Is it easy to use Roader?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, super easy. You switch Roader on by pressing the on/off switch on the bottom of the camera. It boots in 5 seconds so you can use it immediately.</p>
<p><strong>How is Roader different that an Action Cam like GoPro?</strong></p>
<p>Roader is designed for taking video of just relevant and exciting moments. Not hours of video that can be boring and hard to select the right moments. Also, the Social Definition recording resolution is optimized for Social Sharing. The technology we designed and the power management we use, allows Roader to be with you to witness everything for 7 hours on a charge. An Action Cam consumes much more power and will last for 1-2 hours on a battery charge. Action Cams also create huge files that are way to large for social sharing and quick upload.</p>
<p><strong>How do I charge Roader?</strong></p>
<p>Roader comes with the Power Lanyard. The cable for wearing it around your neck is also a charging cable. It has a USB-C connector on both ends so you can charge it easily. Charging takes 3-4 hours and the battery status is indicated by the LED ring on the front of the camera. You can also see the battery level in the App. While using Roader and the battery level drops below 15%, you will receive a notification on your phone indicating the status. This will also happen at 5%.</p>
<p><strong>I do not have a USB-C charger, how to charge?</strong></p>
<p>An adaptor from USB-C to USB-A (standard USB) is supplied with Roader in the box.</p>
<p><strong>Is the image stable when I walk?</strong></p>
<p>We have added an Electronic Image Stabilisation that stabilizes the image digitally. That works very well but to a certain extent. It gives a very realistic image of the moment. Heavy shaking cannot entirely be compensated. For further stabilization, we are planning to add an option to the App at a later stage.</p>
<p><strong>Can I take out the memory card?</strong></p>
<p>Roader is equipped with an onboard memory of 16GB. Plenty of capacity for more than 500 clips in the two resolutions SD (Social Definition) and HD (High Definition). </p>
<p><strong>When </strong><strong>Roader</strong><strong> is disconnected from my phone, does it still record?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. All recordings are stored on the internal memory in both resolutions. Once you reconnect, you will see in the App that you have unsynced clips indicating the number. You can then choose to download them and a Wifi connection is set up and the clips are uploaded to your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Why wouldn’t I use my phone for video recording?</strong></p>
<p>Modern phones have excellent cameras. The significant advantage of Roader is that it records already the last 10 seconds (in the buffer) and you initiate to record after you realize something special happened. At that point, you are most likely too late in taking your phone and start a recording. So you miss the moment. Another advantage is that Roader records in a 120º wide angle while most phones are below 60º.</p>
<p><strong>Does it record sound?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Roader has a built-in microphone.</p>
<p><strong>Can I also record continuously?</strong></p>
<p>In Car Mode, when you put Roader in the Car Dock, it switches automatically to continuous loop recording in 3 minute files. With the wireless remote control that comes with the Car Dock, you can also trigger Event recordings (-10s to +10s) that are automatically uploaded to your phone, just like the wearable mode.</p>
<p><strong>Does it support Live Stream?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can set up a Live Stream to Youtube Live and Facebook Live. It will stream via your phone but does not make a recording.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of Memory card do I need?</strong></p>
<p>You do not need one, Roader has a built-in memory of 16GB. Suitable for more than 500 recordings in SD+HD.</p>
<p><strong>Can Roader also take still images?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, when the video is uploaded to your phone, you can select a frame to use as a still image and store it in your camera roll. </p>
<p><strong>How do I get an HD recording of my video?</strong></p>
<p>The SD version is automatically uploaded to a connected smartphone. When you want the HD version, that stays on the camera, you just select the clip from within the Roader app and press HD. At that moment a WiFi connection is set up between your camera and smartphone for downloading the HD version. Then the clip is indicated with HD in the App. After this download, the WiFi connection will be shut down automatically to save energy.</p>
<p><strong>Does Roader has GPS?</strong></p>
<p>When you trigger an Event Recording, the location of your phone will be added to the file. So in the App, you will then see the location of the recording. We did not integrate GPS in the camera as it consumes a lot of power and reduces battery life.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of battery is used?</strong></p>
<p>We have selected a premium quality Panasonic battery with a capacity of 2350 mAh. </p>
<p><strong>Do you also have different mounts?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning to supply a tripod and bike mount. Depending on requests of customers, we will develop other mounts.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Start recording back in time and Never Miss a Moment Again!
                     
The Roader Time Machine Camera captures moments that occurred before you touch the record button. It is storing footage in its buffer memory for 10 seconds and flushes it constantly. Once you touch the camera, it creates a clip that stars 10 seconds before you touched it, till 10 seconds after. The 20 seconds clip is then automatically uploaded to your phone. Easy as that!
 

 
 
""I wish I had a video of that!""
Most cameras give you only two options: record everything and spend hours editing the raw footage; or worse, miss that special moment because you can’t grab the camera fast enough. Not anymore.
Roader is storing video in a short time memory and does not record anything until you press the camera. When you press it, a video clip is saved that starts 10 seconds back in time. Using the 10-second video that is stored in the short time memory and adding 10 seconds after you pressed the camera.
You can even broadcast your experiences Live using Youtube Live or Facebook Live and keep your phone in your pocket.
  

 

 
 


 



 ""Time machine camera means you'll never miss the moment"" 
   ""Roader Is the Wearable Camera You Control"" 
  ""Missed a moment? This camera goes back in time with a quick click"" 
  ""GoPro should have invented this, but didn’t. It took a small team in the Netherlands to come up with the idea and bring it to CES"" 
 


 



 


When Roader is powered on, it starts buffering video in its RAM memory. The image is stored for 10 seconds and it refreshes constantly. Only when you press the camera it saves a file out of its RAM memory (10 seconds) to the internal flash memory and it adds 10 seconds after the press.
The recording of 20 seconds (video+sound) is then automatically transferred to your phone via Bluetooth. Uploading the SD (Social Definition 720x540p) clip via Bluetooth takes approximately 10 seconds and you can immediately share your video from the Roader App to any social channel (like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Whatsapp, Wechat etc.) or store it in your camera roll.
Another recording of the same moment is stored on the camera in HD (1280x960) and ready to upload to your phone via WiFi when you choose to do so.

 

 
Working with the App
After a clip is created and sent over to your phone, you can easily select the moment you would like to share. Review it and when you want, simply use the editor to trim or enhance it. When ready, just press share and select the Social Channel from the screen. Ready and GO!

 
For Big Screen viewing in HD
An HD (1280x960p) version of your clip is always stored in the camera's memory. When you want to download the HD clip, simply choose the appropriate SD version and press HD. A WiFi connection is set up for the purpose and the HD file is downloaded to your phone. Below the clip, you will see the indication HD appear showing you that the HD version is on your phone. After downloading the HD file, the WiFi connection is shut down to save energy.
 

Wearing and charging Roader is easy with the patent pending Power Lanyard. The Power Lanyard has a USB-C connector on both sides that connect to the wooden block. When the cable is connected to a power supply, the internal battery is charged so you always have the charging cable with you. It is also possible to use the cable for downloading video clips from Roader to a computer. The Roader Indiegogo special ships with a dark grey Power Lanyard. A multiple color pack of 5 Power Lanyards is available with the special perk.

With the optional Car Dock and RF Remote control, Roader can be used as a Car Camera or Dashcam. Easily fit the Suction Cup mount onto the windscreen and connect the power cable. When docked into the Car Mount, Roader is ready to record Events when triggered with the remote control or by G-Sensor Crash Detection. A clip of -10 to +10 seconds is created and automatically sent over to a connected phone. On top of that, Roader starts recording in HD constantly when docked. The constant recordings are split into 3 minutes clips that can be accessed when using the Roader App or when connected to a computer by a cable.

<p>   What’s a handheld camera
without the ability to add your favourite accessories? We thought of that as
well. We added three, ¼"" - brass threads, two on the top to add your
lighting, audio, secondary viewer and a third mount at the bottom to attach a
tripod, monopod, slider or even a stabilizer. Depending on your needs, the
options are really endless. Bellow are some configuration samples.</p>

<p>  </p>
<p>   A little over 2 years ago we embarked on a journey to
create a unique device that would allow us to capture amazing quality videos
and photographs with our smartphones, almost under any circumstances.  </p>
<p>   A smartphone or GoPro is a great way for
taking video and pictures, but it has its limitations. Glare on the screen,
poor audio, limited performance in low light situations, just a few lens
options, poor stability and the constant need to use both hands makes it tough
to get perfect shots and handle well the camera.  </p>
<p>   So, we set out to create a single device
that would maximize the camera potential of the smartphone. We believe we’ve
exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>   Introducing the <b>IndieVice</b>, a
completely revolutionary approach to shooting professional videos and
photographs with your smartphone or GoPro.</p>

The IndieVice is
ergonomically designed and also uses Bluetooth technology to allow zoom control
with the remote rocker switch. We designed the IndieVice so that you can easily
add on virtually any additional equipment. As professional photographers and
videographers we built the IndieVice to meet the exacting standards of a
typical shoot, but with an ease and simplicity of handling that makes our
device accessible to all.</p>

<p>   The IndieVice is a completely new
approach to shooting  video and photography with your smartphone.</p>
<p>   Its ergonomic design mimics the
natural hold and feel of a professional video camera. Because it is extremely
lightweight, it's convenient to carry with you wherever you go and, unlike
other smartphone rigs, you can shoot using just one hand.</p>

variety of lenses. Our lens adapter can support 52mm and 37mm lenses and single

<p>     The Bluetooth controller is removable and can
be magnetically mounted on the IndieVice at several locations. Depending on the
holding position, the controller can be placed above or below the top
hand-grip. This is ideal for follow-me-shots, below the knee shots, and for
popular apps such as Snapchat, Periscope, Skype, etc.. !</p>
<p>   Now you can get those below the
knee and above the shoulder shots that were nearly impossible to get before.</p>

<p>   The IndieVice is ready for manufacturing. Our designs are completed, the global patent pending is in place, and our manufacturers are lined up.  </p>
<p>   We have over 15 years of experience in manufacturing, design, R&amp;D, logistics, and distribution. The IndieVice is not our first product and definitely won't be our last. Our team's extensive experience is just one more reason to feel confident that we are going to make the best IndieVice possible, while making sure it gets delivered to you on time!  </p>
<p>  We need your support IndieGoGo. We have to order expensive molds and require additional capital to buy large quantities in order to receive our volume discounts.</p>
<p>  We want you to have your IndieVice as soon as possible. Here’s our plan to achieve that:</p>
<p><b>• October: </b>Make lots of new IndieGoGo friends. Execute manufacturing agreement. Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the mold/tooling order.</p>
<p><b>• October/November: </b>Order all of the molds, review pre-production samples to ensure proper quality, run small batch productions to ensure quality standards are met, review raw material orders </p>
<p><b>• November</b>: Continue with pre-production builds. Small run batches for quality assurance and product validation testing on-site. Review prior to final sign off on full production. </p>
<p><b>• December</b>: Begin manufacturing, continued batch testing for quality, onsite inspections. Finalize assembly and packaging.</p>
<p><b>• January/February:</b> Review order fulfillment, review complete order list and final packaging, re-confirm orders with supporters prior to completed shipping manifest.</p>
<p>•<b> March:</b> Received shipment and begin fulfillment. </p>
<p>   Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Help us make the IndieVice product a success by clicking the ‘<b>Back This Project</b>’ button at the top of the page, or help us spread the word by sharing our page with your friends and family.</p>
<p>   We can't wait to see what our products will do in some very capable hands!</p>

<p>MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product like the IndieVice is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 30-90 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this kind and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility, we're working with tooling manufacturing partners with a track record for outstanding quality and turnaround time.</p>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: We really think that all the kinks have been worked out. But you just never know until you go into production. If changes need to be made, you can be assured that our only objective will be making the best IndieVice product possible. We're counting on you the consumer to make the IndieVice a huge success and we will let you know exactly how and why any changes are made.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">FULFILLMENT: To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with two back-up suppliers for each component. We ourselves will be handling all of the shipments to our plant in North America, expediting what is necessary to make sure we hit target deadlines. Once at our plant, we will coordinate the shipping and fulfilment with a hands-on approach.</span></p>
<p>Why You Can Count On Us?</p>
<p>Our team has over 25 years of experience in professional videography and photography. For the past 10 years we have focused on design and innovation in these fields.

</div></div>","IndieVice Inc. - Discover the Artistic Potential of Your SmartphoneIndieVice is a revolutionary video and photography system that takes the power of your smartphone and evolves it towards a professional handheld camera.
CHECK OUT the DISCOVERY CHANNEL review







The IndieVice is universal smartphone platform that allows you to add lighting, audio, tripods, and includes a bluetooth remote for zoom + Start/Stop recording.
Quickly and easily, slide any smartphone into the IndieVice and begin taking pictures and filming video. Use only one hand and significantly increase stability in seconds. 



















                 










          




                         
   What’s a handheld camera
without the ability to add your favourite accessories? We thought of that as
well. We added three, ¼"" - brass threads, two on the top to add your
lighting, audio, secondary viewer and a third mount at the bottom to attach a
tripod, monopod, slider or even a stabilizer. Depending on your needs, the
options are really endless. Bellow are some configuration samples.











                 


  
   A little over 2 years ago we embarked on a journey to
create a unique device that would allow us to capture amazing quality videos
and photographs with our smartphones, almost under any circumstances.  
   A smartphone or GoPro is a great way for
taking video and pictures, but it has its limitations. Glare on the screen,
poor audio, limited performance in low light situations, just a few lens
options, poor stability and the constant need to use both hands makes it tough
to get perfect shots and handle well the camera.  
   So, we set out to create a single device
that would maximize the camera potential of the smartphone. We believe we’ve
exceeded our expectations.
   Introducing the IndieVice, a
completely revolutionary approach to shooting professional videos and
photographs with your smartphone or GoPro.


        

                
   

   The IndieVice can adapt
to any size and shape phone. Our universal smartphone adapter is simple to use,
quickly locking your phone in place using only one hand. We can fit all iPhone’s
including the 6+, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, HTC, and Sony.

   
 
The IndieVice is
ergonomically designed and also uses Bluetooth technology to allow zoom control
with the remote rocker switch. We designed the IndieVice so that you can easily
add on virtually any additional equipment. As professional photographers and
videographers we built the IndieVice to meet the exacting standards of a
typical shoot, but with an ease and simplicity of handling that makes our
device accessible to all.



       




                   

   The IndieVice is a completely new
approach to shooting  video and photography with your smartphone.
   Its ergonomic design mimics the
natural hold and feel of a professional video camera. Because it is extremely
lightweight, it's convenient to carry with you wherever you go and, unlike
other smartphone rigs, you can shoot using just one hand.





                  


   The
viewfinder adapts to your eyesight through a special dioptric adjustable lens
while it's enclosed design eliminates sunlight’s glare on your screen.

  




            
 
The IndieVice also has a
direct screen viewing mode. The 180 degree flip screen provides full
accessibility to your smartphone screen functionality for any mobile app
adjustments without having to use the viewfinder.

     *** The Video APP shown in the above animation is FiLMiC Pro. Our Favorite APP.

                       
   
    Whether you want quality videos and photos for
your personal and family use or are producing professional calibre independent
films, journalism or photography, the IndieVice makes it easy.
   Its ergonomic body ensures
comfortable shooting, even after hours of use and it also now makes it easier
to keep your entire workflow all on one single platform.


          




          

   
   The art of photography depends in
large on the type of lenses you use. So with the IndieVice, you can use a large
variety of lenses. Our lens adapter can support 52mm and 37mm lenses and single
element lenses as well. Our own line of optional lens includes fish eye and
ultra-wide angle lenses.
    The IndieVice Pro Model has an
adaptable universal lens adapter that allows you to change professional lenses
in seconds.



     

                                                               


   
Our NEW Static Depth of Field Adapter (DOF)
allows you to use your existing SLR equipment with your IndieVice.
   A DOF adapter focuses your image
onto a translucent screen located between your external lens and our macro
lens. It gives your videos a cinematic look and is worth getting to know,
especially since you can use SLR lenses.



                   
    

    Although
GoPros are great fixed cameras, they lack a handheld cinematic attachment.
 With the indieVice you can now get those handheld cinematic beauty shots
which add so much visual value to productions.  

          

    Now you can use your GoPro to make amazing cinematic videos from start to finish using your IndieVice. The GoPro is also compatible with our Bluetooth remote, so you can control start/stop recording functions from the IndieVice.

      


                    


    One more pro-feature we
have added to the IndieVice, is a wireless zoom rocker switch control. You can
now control your video and photography app without touching the screen.

        
   
     The Bluetooth controller is removable and can
be magnetically mounted on the IndieVice at several locations. Depending on the
holding position, the controller can be placed above or below the top
hand-grip. This is ideal for follow-me-shots, below the knee shots, and for
popular apps such as Snapchat, Periscope, Skype, etc.. !
   Now you can get those below the
knee and above the shoulder shots that were nearly impossible to get before.


     

                Discover the Artistic Potential of your Smartphone with the IndieVice

                      
   The eyepiece is made of a high quality silicone, which is form fitting and rotates 360° for use with either your left or right eye. You no longer need to try to block the sun’s glare with your hand!

         
   The IndieVice will make it tough for you to put it down. Be prepared to enter a new world, one where you have complete control. No wifi chip enabled memory stick. No transfers. Just shoot, edit, and post. Make productions faster, easier, and much more professional.

                               Add a Secondary Viewfinder for Below the Knee Shots

        

         SPECIAL THANKSWe wanted to thank FiLMiC Pro for allowing us to use their amazing APP in our animation. If you have not downloaded it yet, make sure to do so today. You can learn more about the feature platform that FiLMiC Pro offers at www.filmicpro.com. 

                    
   The IndieVice is ready for manufacturing. Our designs are completed, the global patent pending is in place, and our manufacturers are lined up.  
   We have over 15 years of experience in manufacturing, design, R&D, logistics, and distribution. The IndieVice is not our first product and definitely won't be our last. Our team's extensive experience is just one more reason to feel confident that we are going to make the best IndieVice possible, while making sure it gets delivered to you on time!  
  We need your support IndieGoGo. We have to order expensive molds and require additional capital to buy large quantities in order to receive our volume discounts.
  We want you to have your IndieVice as soon as possible. Here’s our plan to achieve that:
• October: Make lots of new IndieGoGo friends. Execute manufacturing agreement. Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the mold/tooling order.
• October/November: Order all of the molds, review pre-production samples to ensure proper quality, run small batch productions to ensure quality standards are met, review raw material orders 
• November: Continue with pre-production builds. Small run batches for quality assurance and product validation testing on-site. Review prior to final sign off on full production. 
• December: Begin manufacturing, continued batch testing for quality, onsite inspections. Finalize assembly and packaging.
• January/February: Review order fulfillment, review complete order list and final packaging, re-confirm orders with supporters prior to completed shipping manifest.
• March: Received shipment and begin fulfillment. 
   Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Help us make the IndieVice product a success by clicking the ‘Back This Project’ button at the top of the page, or help us spread the word by sharing our page with your friends and family.
   We can't wait to see what our products will do in some very capable hands!

<p><strong>Cilj kampanje</strong></p>
<p>Cilj kampanje je prikupljanje finansijskih sredstava za kupovinu nove CCD kamere. Naime, iz opreme koju trenutno imamo izvučen je maksimum i da bi se uradile ozbiljnije stvari, potrebna je bolja oprema, prije svega osjetljivija kamera za astronomiju.<br/>Sa novom CCD kamerom planiraju se slijedeći projekti:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detekcija novih asteroida i kometa</li>
<li>Detekcija ekstrasolarnih planeta (planeta oko drugih zvijezda)</li>
<li>Fotometrija zvijezda</li>
<li>Spektroskopija zvijezda</li>
<li>„Narrowband“ astrofotografija</li>
</ul>
<p>Spomenuti projekti predstavljaju značajan naučni iskorak u BiH i doprinijet će razvoju astronomije koja je u našoj zemlji na koljenima još od završetka rata 1995. godine.</p>

O nama
Neformalna astronomska grupa Sarajevo nastala je 9. maja 2014. godine. Trenutno grupa broji preko 800 članova i kontinuirano promoviše astronomiju. U protekle tri godine urađeno je dosta projekata, a ovo su neki od njih:

Detekcija asteroida i procjena njihovih orbitalnih parametara
Fotometrija varijabilnih zvijezda
Astrofotografija (planete, Mjesec, Sunce, komete, udaljeni nebeski objekti: galaksije, magline i zvjezdani skupovi)
Pisanje tekstova iz opšte astronomije, astrofotografije i fotometrije
Različiti “Do It Yourself” projekti (konstrukcija astro-trackera, modifikacija kamere, stabilizacija dvogleda, modifikacija postolja, solargrafija itd)
Održavanje „Astro partija“ (posmatranje noćnog neba) za širu javnost
Facebook stranica i Facebook grupa sa preko 800 članova
Promovisanje astronomije u medijima
Upostavljanje kontakta sa školama, naučnim institucijama, drugim astronomskim društvima i astrofotografima širom svijeta

Više informacija o našem radu: https://alancatovic.files.wordpress.com/2017/01...
Cilj kampanje
Cilj kampanje je prikupljanje finansijskih sredstava za kupovinu nove CCD kamere. Naime, iz opreme koju trenutno imamo izvučen je maksimum i da bi se uradile ozbiljnije stvari, potrebna je bolja oprema, prije svega osjetljivija kamera za astronomiju.Sa novom CCD kamerom planiraju se slijedeći projekti:

Detekcija novih asteroida i kometa
Detekcija ekstrasolarnih planeta (planeta oko drugih zvijezda)
Fotometrija zvijezda
Spektroskopija zvijezda
„Narrowband“ astrofotografija

Spomenuti projekti predstavljaju značajan naučni iskorak u BiH i doprinijet će razvoju astronomije koja je u našoj zemlji na koljenima još od završetka rata 1995. godine.
Potrebna oprema i troškovi
Za ispunjenje navedenih ciljeva potrebna je slijedeća oprema:

ATIK383L+ 8 Megapixel b/w CCD camera - cooled - low noise - Sensor: Kodak KAF 8300 17.6 x 13.52mm (https://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_in...)

</div></div>","Content creators, we built this for you.
Alice is an AI camera that works with your smartphone to shoot and share better content in a fraction of the time. Capture crystal clear 4K footage straight out of camera — and share it instantly to your followers.
The experience of a phone, the capability of a high-end mirrorless camera. This is the camera for creators.

Alice is an AI-accelerated computational camera. It's a compact and low-profile camera which can be mounted onto the back of your smartphone.
Fast wireless data transfer between camera and phone gives you a seamless real-time viewfinder on your smartphone.
 Read this blog post to see how Alice got its name. 



The phone-grip mechanism works with smartphones as small as the iPhone 6 width (6.42 cm / 2.53 inch) until as large as the iPhone 12 Pro Max width (7.81 cm / 3.07 inch).
Alice will work with both iOS and Android phones, including Samsung, Google, One Plus or any other phone with similar dimensions.

The Alice Camera native smartphone app will connect to and control Alice with a touchscreen interface, giving you a smooth user experience and a faster production workflow.

Create faster with an intuitive experience designed by creators for creators. Get the edge on other creators with a camera that lets you instantly stream and post in 4K, wherever you are. No need to stop to download, export or render.

Instantly live stream and post to Twitch, Youtube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook with a push of a button. Delighting your audience is as simple as: point, shoot, share.

Flip your phone around to work in selfie mode too!

Stand out from the crowd with a 4/3 sensor eight times bigger than your phone’s.  The sensor is similar to the ones found in professional cameras such as the Panasonic GH5S and Black Magic Pocket.
Attach pro lenses and wow your audience with high-quality video captured in full-width 4K.

The imaging sensor inside of Alice has dual native ISO and a quad-bayer structure giving you excellent low-light performance, high dynamic range, exceptionally low noise. 
Edited sample image taken by the Alice Camera indoors and with no flash
Make Alice work for you by attaching any Micro Four Thirds lens, the most flexible and compact interchangeable lens system around, with over 50 professional-quality lenses available. Alice will support autofocus, aperture adjustment and lens stabilisation on all standards-compliant MFT lenses. An ergonomic handle enables better hand placement and stability whilst capturing your scenes.

Attach an adapter to use lenses with different mounts too! There are several lens mount adapters in the market which allow Canon and Nikon lenses as well as a range of vintage lenses to be used with the Micro Four Thirds mount. This video is an extremely helpful explainer:

Harness computational photography to capture the perfect shot straight out of camera. Expand your creativity with AI autofocus, colour science, image enhancement and open source access.
Alice maximises raw capture detail and automatically controls the optical system to give you the best photos and videos straight out of the camera. You set up the shot, leave the rest to Alice.

Take your content to the next level with a shoot-and-share camera that performs trillions of calculations every single second using Google'e edge TPU.

Our patent pending technology allows you to automatically adjust and improve focusing, exposure, colour, night-time shots, object tracking, stabilisation, scene recognition - everything to give you the best shot straight out of camera, so you can focus on composition. 
Read our blog post Computational Photography, Artificial Intelligence and Alice to learn about our four rules of computational photography,

AutomationAlice uses cutting-edge end-to-end deep learning techniques to automate focus, exposure and colour balance. Our algorithms are trained on a huge number of images and use artificial intelligence to learn to adjust focus, exposure and colour correction quickly and accurately in real time.
Image EnhancementAlice’s advanced AI and multi-shot based image enhancement techniques improve dynamic range and low-light performance giving you professional-quality post-processed shots straight out of the camera in real time. The algorithms are conservative by default and designed to give you more control over your creative process.

Electronic StabilisationAlice uses an on-board gyroscope and some clever processing for electronic stabilisation, giving you silky smooth videos free from hand shake. You get full control over the strength of the effect and the amount of cropping used.

Object tracking and scene recognitionThe AI inside Alice has contextual understanding and awareness allowing it to track a variety of objects. Over time, Alice will learn to track more and more objects.



Our smartphone app will have two modes, both designed for creators.
Quick Mode will apply all of our AI settings in auto, allowing you to capture the moment in an instant. Pro Mode will allow you to manually override the settings and will give you maximum control over the final shot.
The camera system and firmware will improve with future software updates through our app.

Menu systems on mirrorless cameras and DSLRs are convoluted, complicated and hard to navigate - you'll probably end up missing the sunset before you can change the white balance. 
With Alice, you’ll get full control over the final shot in time to capture even the most fleeting of moments.
Never miss a shotMenu controls with Alice are simple and easy to use. Fine tune with our intuitive pro settings so you can control your shots like never before — fast.

Imagine a menu system that’s easy to use and navigate, that gives you time instead of taking it? That’s Alice. Organise and search through your photos easily with your smartphone's touch screen.


You want every image and video to be better than the last. So do we. Regular updates mean your camera will always stay up-to-date with the latest tech and features.
Plus, Alice’s open-source software can be customised like no other camera — anyone will be free to build add-ons and features, and everyone will be able to benefit. 
Alice will work on both iOS and Android phones.

Our mission is to empower the next generation of creators.
Our team is made up of creators, photographers and engineers and we set out to build Alice because we were frustrated by the lack of innovation and usability of the digital cameras in the market today. 

Our development has been turbocharged by taking part in several prestigious accelerator programmes run by Entrepreneur First, UCL Innovation & Enterprise, NVIDIA and the Digital Catapult.
We won a £175,000 grant from Innovate UK, the UK Government's innovation agency, which means we have the funds necessary to continue the development of the Alice Camera.
We joined the Micro Four Thirds System standard run by Olympus and Panasonic which means that Alice will be fully compliant with the requirements of the standard.


We've been working together with Aetha Design over the last 12 months to refine, test and perfect the design of Alice. 
Aetha Design was founded by engineers from Dyson and have vast experience designing consumer electronics, camera products and lifestyle products.

The Aetha team started out with initial sketches and concept drawings of the Alice Camera and then produced a series of CAD designs and 3D printed models to test the aesthetics, ergonomics and core hardware features.

<h2>1. STORY &amp; BACKGROUND: </h2>
<p>Our company was founded in late 2017, with one single thing in mind - to develop &amp; create the best possible gear for Content Creators. </p>
<p>This project has been running for about a year now, and the idea came to life in late 2019 when some of us got tired of constantly running out of charge while out creating content on our smartphones. </p>
<p>With our product design (patent pending), we have solved this issue once and for all.</p>
<p>The wireless charger is fully integrated into <strong>THE SV RIG</strong> and can easily be swapped out for a new battery in a matter of seconds, just like you would do on a DSLR camera. Giving you the confidence to finally be able to use your smartphone out on the field for a full day of shooting.</p>
<p>The Rig, battery and all other accessories have been designed at our HQ in Sweden.<br/>The great team which has made this all possible consists of people from all around the world - ranging from experts, partners, customers, suppliers and ourselves. </p>
<p>Some of you might remember our Kickstarter Campaign from January this year, which showcased an very early design of <strong>THE SV RIG</strong>. This was clearly a prototype, and much different from what we can see now. </p>
<p>Now, more than half a year later - we proudly present to you <strong>the finished product.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The SV Charger features: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>15W wireless power output (Wireless Fast Charging)</li>
<li>USB A input</li>
<li>USB C output (Charge a second item whilst still charging your phone wirelessly)</li>

<p><i>""Vertical Rig Set-up"" showcased above. </i></p>
<h3><strong>The accessories which will be ready at launch (10/2021): </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>TOP HANDLE </b><br/>Made from aircraft grade aluminum, featuring 8x quarter inch female threads and 2x cold shoes. Giving you full flexibility. <br/> </li>
<li>
<b>COUNTER WEIGHTS </b><br/>These counter weights keeps your rig in balance, and weighs in at ~200 grams per piece. Many times you are forced to attaching accessories to your rig on either the left or right side, which makes your rig unbalanced and more uncomfortable to work with. These counter weights is mounted inside the Side handles so they dont compromise the overall design and looks of THE SV RIG itself. <br/> </li>
<li>
<b>SIDE HANDLES</b><br/>The side handles can be mounted anywhere on THE SV RIG, giving you the opportunity to shot in both a Horizontal set-up or a Vertical set-up. That is unique.<br/>The handles is ergonomically designed and made from ABS plastic in order to give you a solid grip whilst shooting. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>THE SV CHARGER</strong><br/>Did you ever run out of charge whilst creating out on the field? Need some “extra juice”? Then this SV CHARGER will sort that out, with its 6000mAh charging capacity, and max. 15W wireless charging output. Did you know that you can still use the USB C port to charge other units whilst still charging your phone wirelessly?</li>

<h2><strong>3.3 FUNDING GOAL</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Our funding goal is fixed, and set to 12.000:- EUR. </strong></p>
<p>This is a minimum sales target that is calculated in order to cover for all necessary costs related to the ""SOP"" (Start Of Production) of THE SV RIG + CHARGER. </p>
<p>The first batch of any given product, always has initial higher production costs, mainly due to fulfilment, additional labor costs, quality inspection (which is a bit tougher the first time around), etc. </p>
<p><strong>We have taken into account the following, but not limited to: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fulfilment costs</li>
<li>Custom costs</li>
<li>Labor costs</li>
<li>Higher initial costs for quality assurance of the first batch (500-1000 pcs)</li>
<li>Warehouse costs</li>
<li>Etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let´s do this! We definitely think that we can reach these targets together. </p>
<h2><strong>4. R&amp;D, MANUFACTURING &amp; CERTIFICATION</strong></h2>
<p>We have been surrounded by a great team of people this past year, and we can not thank each and everyone of you enough for all your efforts, and long hours that have been put into this project to make it all happen in time. </p>

<p><i>THE SV RIG project has been quite a ride, thats for sure.<br/><strong>Please note! </strong>The video above shows an early design of THE SV RIG. </i></p>
<p>We have been developing both THE SV RIG and Charger over at out HQ in Sweden. The team have included external experts, partners, employees and suppliers just to name a few. </p>
<p>Some pictures from our ongoing manufacturing can be seen below. </p>
<h2><strong>4.1 THE SV CHARGER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>- Some early pictures of the tooling</strong> for the Battery Covers on the Factory floor, waiting to produce some first ""off tooling samples"" - good times. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630857198/fe3fawf51rsxrli2qfyu.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><strong>- Testing ongoing</strong> at TÜV SÜD, a trusted 3rd party certification company worldwide.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630857373/e9ipw9uq3d3xx1eezmnx.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><strong>- And finally, some SV CHARGERS</strong> at the final assembly line, shots taken end of week 35. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630857701/xerjenjhjageamtsn2sb.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h2><strong>​4.2 THE SV RIG.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>- Some shots of all the Aluminum parts,</strong> before we sent them for ""painting"" (Oxidization process) <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630857732/vtmxtcwq7y9i8x59bk8p.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><strong>- Starting to look like something now,</strong> oxidation completed, just a bit tweaking left to do. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630857843/ixefeb4y6qids0bptfl7.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><strong>- Let’s </strong><strong>look at the raw material, </strong>which will be used to produce the tooling for THE SV RIGs ""ABS - plastic parts"". <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630857863/zewhhoyrxefciyssshzx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>It is difficult to show the manufacturing process in a fair way</strong>, but the SV team really want to thank the professional team which has been dealing with the day-to-day tasks, ensuring great quality &amp; control throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>What we have done with <strong>THE SV CHARGER</strong>, is to do all the certifications which is mentioned &amp; ""recommended"" under the CE (European conformity) &amp; UL (Underwriters' Laboratories).</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong> that many of these certifications is not actually needed for companies to do in order to release a product on the marketplace, therefore we see a lot of ""unsafe"" batteries out there, especially when we talk about 3rd party accessories.  </p>
<p><strong>The SV team have gone further, </strong>we have made more certifications than what is regulated by the law.</p>
<p><strong>Then what does this mean for you?</strong><br/>It means that you will get a ""state of the art"" battery in terms of battery safety, meaning that you can always rest assure that this is a safe product to use.  </p>
<h2><strong>5. PARTNERS</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, <strong>this wouldn´t have been possible without all these great people involved</strong>. We have been testing prototypes since January this year, ensuring that all aspects and functions of the final product is taken into consideration. </p>
<p>During April this year, we announced a part of our ""product testing team"", which would take <strong>THE SV RIG</strong> through its paces.<br/>We just finalized all the user testing, and we have been thrilled working together with you all.</p>
<p><strong>It is with a warm heart we extend our deepest gratitude to all of you. </strong></p>

<h2><strong>7. RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></h2>
<p>All ongoing projects comes with a risk, lets face it. But it is how you minimize and mitigate each risk that counts, and it is what makes some projects successful and some not. </p>
<p>Now, when we are so close to the finish line, we believe that we have mitigated and accounted for all risks related to the SOP (Start Of Production) which is due to start week 39.</p>
<p>Unforeseen issues can always come up in a project, and it is normal. But rest assure, we will keep you updated about the progress and about any eventual delays. </p>

<h2><strong>8. ENVIRONMENTAL- SOCIAL &amp; CORPORATE COMMITMENTS</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630907966/xoncsues3ppf2ghac8l9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>SV ASSETS</strong> strives to make an impact in this world, with the help of implementing a correct management system which can control the complete value chain in a better way.<br/>We focus on 3 key areas (ESG), which are <strong>Environmental aspects</strong>, <strong>Social aspects </strong>and <strong>Governance aspects</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Environmental aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing CO2 footprint</li>
<li>Strategies for greener batteries:</li>
<li>Energy efficiency in cell production.</li>
<li>Renewable energy in cell production.</li>
<li>Recycling of material (including e.g. scrap in cell production.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social sustainability in the battery value chain</li>
<li>Develop a responsible sourcing management system.</li>
<li>Cobalt: risk of forced- and/or child labor</li>
<li>Consider Li-ion chemistries with less cobalt (e.g. NMC) or no cobalt (e.g. LFP).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governance aspects</strong></p>
<ul><li>Anti-corruption practices, especially down the value chain</li></ul>
<p>What we will heavily focus on for this campaign is the ""social aspects"", when it comes to the mining of the raw materials (Cobalt in this case).<br/>Cobalt is the raw material which is used in almost all our electronic powered devices, and the mining is far from safe, fair and good for the environment. </p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>our first step is to minimize the amount of Cobalt used in our cells, by using a cell which is called ""NMC"". </strong>This means that there is less Cobalt in our lithium batteries than what it is in other products which uses lithium. </p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>we will also donate money to PACT.<br/>For each battery we sell, we will donate 5% of the sales. </strong><b style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The donation will be directed to the mining projects. They have some amazing projects up and running now</b><b style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </b>concerning <b style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">mining of these metals. </b><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Read more about the projects <a href=""https://www.pactworld.org/mines-markets/project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here </a></span></p>

<p><b>We fully support their great work around the globe, and we are proud to become a donor.</b></p>
<h2><strong>8. ENDING NOTES</strong></h2>
<p><strong>All our products come with a 1 year warranty. </strong>That goes for all our current listed products on <a href=""https://svoptics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.SVoptics.com</a></p>

<p>We have also taken great care in the selection of our suppliers, we embrace the care for the workers and we are supporting the workers union wherever we can. <strong>Our suppliers fulfill relevant standards and norms that are to be expected such as ISO9001, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Our supply chain is constantly working hard towards creating an optimal distribution of our products. All concepts and prototypes have been sourced and produced in Sweden using local suppliers, <strong>everything to minimize the environmental impact throughout the project.</strong></p>
<p>We will take into account all factors, and check all possible distribution channels by sea, air and road before shipping out the products to our backers. <strong>We will choose the ""greenest routing"" wherever, and whenever possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will ship our products from our 2 main sites.</strong><br/>EU customers will get their products from our local warehouse in Sweden, whilst customers outside of the EU will primarily get their products directly from our factory warehouse. (Which is based outside of Hong Kong).<br/>All to be able to reach a sustainable supply chain.</p>

Ever felt that you need a bit of an extra charge to your phone?Then THE SV RIG will have you sorted out with its 6000mAh WIRELESS CHARGER, which is fully integrated into THE SV RIG itself. 

-""For Content Creators, By Content Creators.Start Creating Without Limits.""
NOTE! Several images & videos in this campaign shows the prototype status of THE SV RIG (Rig Color: Grey), Final appearance of THE SV RIG (Rig Color: Black). Contact us if any questions.
1. STORY & BACKGROUND: 
Our company was founded in late 2017, with one single thing in mind - to develop & create the best possible gear for Content Creators. 
This project has been running for about a year now, and the idea came to life in late 2019 when some of us got tired of constantly running out of charge while out creating content on our smartphones. 
With our product design (patent pending), we have solved this issue once and for all.
The wireless charger is fully integrated into THE SV RIG and can easily be swapped out for a new battery in a matter of seconds, just like you would do on a DSLR camera. Giving you the confidence to finally be able to use your smartphone out on the field for a full day of shooting.
The Rig, battery and all other accessories have been designed at our HQ in Sweden.The great team which has made this all possible consists of people from all around the world - ranging from experts, partners, customers, suppliers and ourselves. 
Some of you might remember our Kickstarter Campaign from January this year, which showcased an very early design of THE SV RIG. This was clearly a prototype, and much different from what we can see now. 
Now, more than half a year later - we proudly present to you the finished product.

2.2 The SV CHARGER (WIRELESS - 15W)


Our new developed Wireless Charger which will take things to the next level.

The SV Charger have been developed from scratch, in order to fit THE SV RIG in the best possible way.We have gone through all the needed certifications & testing - making it a ""state of the art"", in terms on battery safety. 
Local Swedish battery experts have been working closely with the SV Team & its suppliers, in order to ensure a safe battery design. 
The SV Charger uses a 6000mAh cell which can both charge your phone wirelessly and another item at the same time using the included USB cable - this functionality has never been available on a smartphone rig before. 
The SV Charger features: 

15W wireless power output (Wireless Fast Charging)
USB A input
USB C output (Charge a second item whilst still charging your phone wirelessly)
LED status indicators
IP65 rated (Bring it on your next adventures & travels which confidence) 
Unique, Swedish design (Both internally, and externally).  


2.3 SMARTPHONE RIG ACCESSORIES
THE SV RIG will come with multiple accessories which has been tailor made to fit the rig. Some of them are available to purchase as separate perks, whilst others will be included in the bundles. (Stay tuned on our homepage after the Indiegogo campaign for more great accessories which is in development now, and which will be released Q1 2022.)

""Vertical Rig Set-up"" showcased above. 
The accessories which will be ready at launch (10/2021): 


TOP HANDLE Made from aircraft grade aluminum, featuring 8x quarter inch female threads and 2x cold shoes. Giving you full flexibility.  

COUNTER WEIGHTS These counter weights keeps your rig in balance, and weighs in at ~200 grams per piece. Many times you are forced to attaching accessories to your rig on either the left or right side, which makes your rig unbalanced and more uncomfortable to work with. These counter weights is mounted inside the Side handles so they dont compromise the overall design and looks of THE SV RIG itself.  

SIDE HANDLESThe side handles can be mounted anywhere on THE SV RIG, giving you the opportunity to shot in both a Horizontal set-up or a Vertical set-up. That is unique.The handles is ergonomically designed and made from ABS plastic in order to give you a solid grip whilst shooting.  

THE SV CHARGERDid you ever run out of charge whilst creating out on the field? Need some “extra juice”? Then this SV CHARGER will sort that out, with its 6000mAh charging capacity, and max. 15W wireless charging output. Did you know that you can still use the USB C port to charge other units whilst still charging your phone wirelessly?

Accessories for THE SV RIG which will be released after launch (10/2021):

All inquiries related to retail agreements, product catalogues, wholesale, etc. shall be directed to the following email adress: 
Sales@SVoptics.com
For more information about our current warehouses, logistics, supply chain solutions etc. Please contact our sales team. 
3.3 FUNDING GOAL
Our funding goal is fixed, and set to 12.000:- EUR. 
This is a minimum sales target that is calculated in order to cover for all necessary costs related to the ""SOP"" (Start Of Production) of THE SV RIG + CHARGER. 
The first batch of any given product, always has initial higher production costs, mainly due to fulfilment, additional labor costs, quality inspection (which is a bit tougher the first time around), etc. 
We have taken into account the following, but not limited to: 

Fulfilment costs
Custom costs
Labor costs
Higher initial costs for quality assurance of the first batch (500-1000 pcs)
Warehouse costs
Etc. 

Let´s do this! We definitely think that we can reach these targets together. 
4. R&D, MANUFACTURING & CERTIFICATION
We have been surrounded by a great team of people this past year, and we can not thank each and everyone of you enough for all your efforts, and long hours that have been put into this project to make it all happen in time. 

THE SV RIG project has been quite a ride, thats for sure.Please note! The video above shows an early design of THE SV RIG. 
We have been developing both THE SV RIG and Charger over at out HQ in Sweden. The team have included external experts, partners, employees and suppliers just to name a few. 
Some pictures from our ongoing manufacturing can be seen below. 
4.1 THE SV CHARGER
- Some early pictures of the tooling for the Battery Covers on the Factory floor, waiting to produce some first ""off tooling samples"" - good times. - Testing ongoing at TÜV SÜD, a trusted 3rd party certification company worldwide.- And finally, some SV CHARGERS at the final assembly line, shots taken end of week 35.  
​4.2 THE SV RIG.
- Some shots of all the Aluminum parts, before we sent them for ""painting"" (Oxidization process) - Starting to look like something now, oxidation completed, just a bit tweaking left to do. - Let’s look at the raw material, which will be used to produce the tooling for THE SV RIGs ""ABS - plastic parts"". 
It is difficult to show the manufacturing process in a fair way, but the SV team really want to thank the professional team which has been dealing with the day-to-day tasks, ensuring great quality & control throughout the whole process.
What we have done with THE SV CHARGER, is to do all the certifications which is mentioned & ""recommended"" under the CE (European conformity) & UL (Underwriters' Laboratories).
Please note that many of these certifications is not actually needed for companies to do in order to release a product on the marketplace, therefore we see a lot of ""unsafe"" batteries out there, especially when we talk about 3rd party accessories.  
The SV team have gone further, we have made more certifications than what is regulated by the law.
Then what does this mean for you?It means that you will get a ""state of the art"" battery in terms of battery safety, meaning that you can always rest assure that this is a safe product to use.  
5. PARTNERS
As mentioned previously, this wouldn´t have been possible without all these great people involved. We have been testing prototypes since January this year, ensuring that all aspects and functions of the final product is taken into consideration. 
During April this year, we announced a part of our ""product testing team"", which would take THE SV RIG through its paces.We just finalized all the user testing, and we have been thrilled working together with you all.
It is with a warm heart we extend our deepest gratitude to all of you.

7. RISKS AND CHALLENGES
All ongoing projects comes with a risk, lets face it. But it is how you minimize and mitigate each risk that counts, and it is what makes some projects successful and some not. 
Now, when we are so close to the finish line, we believe that we have mitigated and accounted for all risks related to the SOP (Start Of Production) which is due to start week 39.
Unforeseen issues can always come up in a project, and it is normal. But rest assure, we will keep you updated about the progress and about any eventual delays. 

8. ENVIRONMENTAL- SOCIAL & CORPORATE COMMITMENTS

SV ASSETS strives to make an impact in this world, with the help of implementing a correct management system which can control the complete value chain in a better way.We focus on 3 key areas (ESG), which are Environmental aspects, Social aspects and Governance aspects. 
Environmental aspects

Reducing CO2 footprint
Strategies for greener batteries:
Energy efficiency in cell production.
Renewable energy in cell production.
Recycling of material (including e.g. scrap in cell production.)

Social aspects

Social sustainability in the battery value chain
Develop a responsible sourcing management system.
Cobalt: risk of forced- and/or child labor
Consider Li-ion chemistries with less cobalt (e.g. NMC) or no cobalt (e.g. LFP).

Governance aspects
Anti-corruption practices, especially down the value chain
What we will heavily focus on for this campaign is the ""social aspects"", when it comes to the mining of the raw materials (Cobalt in this case).Cobalt is the raw material which is used in almost all our electronic powered devices, and the mining is far from safe, fair and good for the environment. 
Therefore, our first step is to minimize the amount of Cobalt used in our cells, by using a cell which is called ""NMC"". This means that there is less Cobalt in our lithium batteries than what it is in other products which uses lithium. 
Furthermore, we will also donate money to PACT.For each battery we sell, we will donate 5% of the sales. The donation will be directed to the mining projects. They have some amazing projects up and running now concerning mining of these metals. Read more about the projects here 

We fully support their great work around the globe, and we are proud to become a donor.
8. ENDING NOTES
All our products come with a 1 year warranty. That goes for all our current listed products on www.SVoptics.com
You can rest assure that we have taken into account several factors, following all relevant design guidelines from all the relevant norms & standards in order to ensure safe, and long lasting products.All our electronic products will be certified against CE & UL.
We have also taken great care in the selection of our suppliers, we embrace the care for the workers and we are supporting the workers union wherever we can. Our suppliers fulfill relevant standards and norms that are to be expected such as ISO9001, etc.
Our supply chain is constantly working hard towards creating an optimal distribution of our products. All concepts and prototypes have been sourced and produced in Sweden using local suppliers, everything to minimize the environmental impact throughout the project.
We will take into account all factors, and check all possible distribution channels by sea, air and road before shipping out the products to our backers. We will choose the ""greenest routing"" wherever, and whenever possible.
We will ship our products from our 2 main sites.EU customers will get their products from our local warehouse in Sweden, whilst customers outside of the EU will primarily get their products directly from our factory warehouse. (Which is based outside of Hong Kong).All to be able to reach a sustainable supply chain.

Forging is structured in higher density, which brings DCP better strength than others.The material of DCP is AL6061 and AL2014 alloy that’s commonly used in bike and aerospace field. Furthermore, CNC craft gives DCP the best precision and quality steadily for mass production.
Test and function verification of CNC sample are well done already.
We have complete manufacturing experience and processing supply chain.
All drawings are done, pending for tooling kick-off after reaching the goal.
Strap samples are handmade currently, will kick template off after meeting the goal.Logo tooling hasn’t been started, so DUO Logo on photos are composite presently.Once the goal is reached, tooling of Logo and the anti-slip rubber will be kicked off as shown 3D rendering.All components are made in Taiwan, including the straps. They’re  sewed by hands in Taiwan. Thanks to manufacturers who have cooperated for years during my career.They’re the greatest supporters behind this project.  This project can't be come true without their professional technical assistance and your support. How is the goal set? It's tooling cost for the project actually. This product is one of a kind in the market, we’ll make all-out effort to promote it in the future, furthermore, we’ll extend more possibilities continuously.Please help us share on community websites(ex: IG, Twitter, Facebook...) so that more potential sponsors can see us. Your sharing will be the greatest promoter of our project's success!Actual schedule will be based on tooling kick-off date. Once fundraising amount is over the goal, tooling may be kicked off immediately even the fundraising project haven’t been ended. Why DUO CAMERA PLATE is called DUO?Since it’s of dual-use mode, and the designer of it is Duo. That’s why we stick to the name with dogged persistence.Duo Chung had been in bike designing field for years and has been a camera fancier for a long period. That’s why he’d like to make this product come true insistently.If your camera had been put in dry box for years, let DUO CAMERA PLATE bring your enthusiasm back.Portfolio  Duo Chung Profile Whale Tsai is a RD engineer in automobile field who’s the finance minister and technical support of DUO CAMERA PLATEIt takes us almost 1 year to improve and fine the DCP, we believe it can bring a brand-new shooting experience to users. Duo CAMERA PLATE goes with full commitment and best offer from manufacturers and component suppliers which gives us abundant confidence. We’re ready for mass production.Even there may probably be some unexpected dilemmas and delays during the process just like other startups and new projects. We promise that we’ll make all-out effort and do our best to minimize the risks in production process and we will keep working hard in order to ensure delivering low-risk, high-quality products on time.Aim at conveying our passion for the product to every user, making them feel it and trust our products. Deep understanding products, continuous innovation, simplified design & implementation, and ongoing improvement are our Warranties to users.",53.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Designed around portability and practicality, it has an integrated battery that’s rechargeable via a conventional smartphone’s USB-C cable.

<p>With Tiny Flash, we managed to cram a decent amount of light into a very compact form- factor. Using a flash no longer means carrying a bulky device in your bag or on your camera. In fact, it’s so small and inconspicuous that you will likely want to keep it mounted onto your camera at all times.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To make things even easier and convenient, we have designed Tiny Flash with an integrated battery. This means you will no longer have to go through the logistics of carrying a battery-charger, taking out the batteries of your flash, charging them, and putting them back in. Tiny Flash recharges via its own USB Type-C port, just like the majority of smartphones. You can charge it from the mains, from a laptop, or from any other USB power socket. You can even charge it on-the-go, directly from your Android smartphone. This will give you a few bursts of light in just a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Whether you shoot analog or digital, the latest high megapixel sensor or a vintage camera, Tiny Flash has you covered. Stripping it down from any complexity and keeping the bare essentials means that it is compatible with the vast majority of cameras, old or new. That likely includes your camera.</p>
<p>For cameras designed during or after the 70s, Tiny Flash is simply mounted onto the hot-shoe, like any modern flash. And if your camera is older, like an older Leica M body, then you can connect Tiny Flash via the PC sync port of your camera.</p>

<p>One button. One mode. From powering ON and OFF to testing and to shooting, Tiny flash has only one button to do everything. We’ve stripped down the concept of flash from its redundant functions, and counterproductive automations, and reduced it to its bare essence.</p>

<p>One crucial consideration for many photographers is how our gear looks. Not so much for the sake of aesthetics, but because our tools will influence the behaviour of our subjects.</p>
<p>A flash can be an intimidating object that doesn’t always help approaching people.</p>
<p>Tiny Flash addresses this issue by being the most inconspicuous piece of lighting equipment. Its size and design, carefully crafted after modernist aesthetics principles, make it barely noticeable when mounted on a camera.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>With Tiny Flash, we aimed at developing a tool for all photographers, from the ones who invariably use strobes, to the ones who never use flash, and those among us who only occasionally need that extra dose of photons.

<h2>More About the Project</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As photographers, we sometimes miss crucial shots because there is just not enough light at hand. Some of us address these situations with a flash, but these are often added bulk we just don’t want to carry around. The operation of a conventional camera flash also tends to involve overly technical settings, the cumbersome logistics of carrying batteries and chargers; not to mention the compatibility issues that arise with older camera models. These can make using a flash a daunting process, especially for those among us who favour a more candid approach to their practice.</p>
<p>At MOON we wanted to address these issues. We set out to produce a camera flash that breaks from those impracticalities, and gets photographers a strobe always at hand.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In order to achieve this, we applied the same underlying principles of industrial and user experience design that were at the heart of some of the most practical innovations in photography: from Oskar Barnack’s invention of the compact 35mm Leica bodies, to Yoshihisa Maitani’s compact and efficient Olympus camera systems. Our aim was to devise and fine-tune the most optimal compromise between size, burst-power, battery life, recycle time, and ease-of-use.  The result is an elegant solution - a flash that’s compact enough to be with you at all times, in your pocket or mounted onto your camera. One that is effortless to operate, and does only what you need, perfectly.</p>

<p>There is always a risk associated with creating and making electronic products. However we are confident Tiny Flash is ready for production. We do not foresee any major challenge with manufacturing as this is a conventional product for a factory assembling this type of product.<br/>Before going into production, we will need to verify compliance and certify for safety requirements. And although there is always a risk Tiny Flash doesn't comply, we have designed it with certification in mind. and we do not foresee any challenge here either.<br/>In case a problem was to arise, we would simply make the necessary changes to the product in order to proceed.</p>

<h3>Commitment</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to make sustainable products is to make them as long-lasting as possible. For that reason, Leica cameras are one of the greatest examples of sustainability.<br/>Tiny Flash is designed with just that in mind. We aimed to engineer it so it lasts many years. The body is solidly built, and the integrated battery is a widely available standard component that can be easily replaced by a professional camera repair technician.</p>

The body is solidly built, and the integrated battery is a widely available standard component that can be easily replaced by a professional camera repair technician.

<h2>FAQ´s - Die häufig gestellten Fragen zum Produkt</h2>
<h3>Wichtig! Gegenanzeige</h3>
<p>Der X-Chec Sustainer ist kein Ersatz für Ihre Zahnärztin oder Ihren Zahnarzt!<br/>Der X-Chec Sustainer hat nur die Funktion Sie bei der Überwachung Ihres Mundhygienezustandes zu unterstützen.<br/>In Zweifelsfällen sollten Sie immer Ihre Zahnärztin oder Ihren Zahnarzt konsultieren.</p>
<h3>Was macht unser Produkt so besonders?</h3>
<p>Der X-Chec Sustainer ist die erste Mundkamera mit App- Verbindung zur Kommunikation mit all Ihren elektronischen Geräten und zur Verbindung mit Ihrem Doc für eine Schnelldiagnose ohne aufwändigen Arztbesuch.<br/>Die mitgelieferte App erlaubt Ihnen die vergrößerte Übertragung Ihrer Bilder wahlweise auf Smartphone, Smartwatch, Pad, Laptop oder anderen digitalen Darstellungsgeräten (z.B. Fernseher). Die Bilder können wahlweise archiviert oder zum Beispiel auch an Ihren Arzt versendet werden.<br/>Mit der App werden Bilder mit typischen Erkrankungen der Zähne in verschiedenen Stadien geliefert , sodass Sie eine erste grobe Einschätzung haben, ob die von Ihnen festgestellten Mängel schon behandlungsfähig sind oder ob Sie noch warten können. Die endgültige Entscheidung sollte aber immer Ihre Ärztin oder Ihr Arzt fällen.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Welche Probleme löst unser Produkt?</h3>
<p>Mit dem X-Chec Sustainer können Sie zu jeder Zeit den Gesundheitszustand Ihrer Zähne auch an den Stellen beobachten, die normalerweise nur Ihr Zahnarzt sieht.<br/>Sie können den Reinigungszustand Ihrer Zähne in jeder Ecke beurteilen. Mundgeruch kann so extrem sicher bekämpft werden.<br/>Sie müssen nicht mehr routinemäßig zum Zahnarzt, sondern nur, wenn es auch einen Anlass gibt.<br/>Sie ersparen sich unnötige Kosten, Fahr- und Wartezeit.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Wo funktioniert unser Produkt?</h3>
<p>Ein X-Chec Sustainer ist eigentlich nichts anderes als ein Zahnarztspiegel mit angebauter Kamera und Übertragungssystem.<br/>Das im Sustainer befindliche Kamerasystem sendet die Bildinformationen via Bluetooth-Schnittstelle auf Ihre Peripheriegeräte.<br/>Im Gehäuse des X-Checkers befindet sich außerdem eine Batterie-Ladeeinheit, die per Induktion aufgeladen werden kann. Deshalb funktioniert das Gerät auch kabellos.<br/>Die W-LAN Schnittstelle hat eine Reichweite von bis zu 5 Metern. Die Bildübertragung funktioniert nur mit Ihrer persönlichen App. So ist sichergestellt, dass kein anderer die Bilder Ihres X-Checers empfangen kann!<br/>Das Ladegerät ist ein Standardcharger wie Sie es von vielen Geräten (z.B. elektrische Zahnbürste oder Munddusche) kennen.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Wo kann man unser Produkt gut gebrauchen?</h3>
<p>Ein X-Chec Sustainer funktioniert fast überall. Sein Temperatureinsatzbereich liegt inklusive dem Ladegerät bei -10 bis +40 Grad Celsius. Er ist wasserdicht bis zu einem Meter Tauchtiefe und kann unter fließendem Wasser mit einer Temperatur von bis zu 40 Grad Celsius (Handwarm) mit einem für Kunststoff zugelassenes Reinigungsmittel gereinigt werden.<br/>Die Spiegelsysteme können bequem im kochenden Wasser sterilisiert werden.<br/>Das Ladegerät sollte nur mit für Kunststoff zugelassenem Reinigungsmittel gesäubert werden und darf keinesfalls unter fließendem Wasser gereinigt werden. Bitte nur mit einem feuchten Tuch reinigen. Bei der Reinigung des Ladegerätes ist grundsätzlich der Netzstecker zu ziehen!</p>
<p>Natürlich können Sie Ihren X-Chec Sustainer auch zweckentfremden um verloren gegangene Gegenstände in unzugänglichen Ecken zu suchen oder um in Geräte hineinzuschauen, die Sie mit bloßem Auge nicht erreichen können. Eine Spiegelsterilisation ist allerdings nach solchen Aktionen obligatorisch.<br/>Und selbstverständlich können Sie mit dem X-Chec Sustainer auch den Zahnzustand Ihres Lieblings bzw. Ihrer Lieblinge kontrollieren (dazu empfehlen wir allerdings einen oder mehrere weitere Spiegel (;-) und die Nutzung eines Beißholzes, damit der Spiegelhalter nicht durch einen ungewollten Kauversuch verbogen wird). Besonders Hunde mögen keinen Blick in ihr Maul (Katzen sind auch nicht besonders glücklich darüber).</p>
<h3>
<br/>Wer könnte unser Produkt brauchen?</h3>
<p>Der X-Chec Sustainer ist für alle da.<br/>Die Zahngesundheit bei Kindern unter 14 Jahren (empfohlenes Alter) können von Mama oder Papa bequem angesehen und im Verdachtsfall vom Arzt geprüft werden.<br/>Jugendliche ab 14 prüfen Ihren Mundhygienezustand am besten selbst. So werden sie nicht von den Eltern gegängelt und Flirtprobleme lassen sich am besten verhindern!<br/>Erwachsene werden schon aus Kostengründen unsere Sustainer lieben. Eine unnütze Fahrt inklusive Wartezeit zum Arzt und der entstehenden Behandlungskosten1 holt die Anschaffungskosten schon wieder rein.<br/>Ältere Leute ersparen sich mühsame Fahrten zum Arzt und durch die Projektionsfähigkeit der Bilder auf beliebig große Bildschirme können sogar die meisten Einschränkungen bei Sehbehinderungen überbrückt werden.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Wessen Probleme löst unser Produkt?</h3>
<p>Der X-Chec Sustainer löst einige Probleme von Ihnen und denen Ihres Arztes.<br/>Sie haben eine „wann immer ich es will“ Kontrolle Ihres Mundgesundheitszustandes, spart Ihnen unnötige Kosten, Fahr-, Warte- und Untersuchungszeiten. Damit schonen Sie sogar die Umwelt!<br/>Ihr Arzt hat keine gefüllten Wartezimmer mit Patienten, die noch keine Behandlung benötigen und hat mehr Zeit für die, die seiner Aufmerksamkeit bedürfen.<br/>Ihre Bilder kann er prüfen, wann es in seine Zeitpläne am Besten passt, Ihre Diagnose sendet er Ihnen bequem per App zurück. Er kann Ihnen gleich Terminvorschläge mitsenden, die Sie bequem per App bestätigen können.<br/>Sie entscheiden den besten Zeitpunkt für Ihre Behandlung bei Ihrem Doc. Bei Unsicherheiten können Sie sich anonym auch noch eine Gegenmeinung einholen, ohne Ihrem Arzt misstrauen zu signalisieren.</p>
<h3>Wer möchte unser Produkt haben?</h3>
<p>Der X-Chec Sustainer ist grundsätzlich für alle da.<br/>Vom Kleinkind bis zur Seniorin oder Senior ist es die ideale Ergänzung zur täglichen Mundhygienekontrolle.<br/>Besonders empfehlenswert ist der Cross Checker für:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kostenbewusste</li>
<li>Umweltbewusste</li>
<li>Termingeplagte</li>
<li>Gesundheitsbewusste und vom Mundgeruch geplagte Menschen</li>
</ul>
<h3>Positive Effekte durch die Nutzung?</h3>
<p>Mit einem X-Chec Sustainer entwickeln Sie das angenehme Gefühl, den Gesundheitszustand Ihrer Zähne immer unter Kontrolle zu haben. Die von den meisten Menschen empfundene Unsicherheit in den Wartezimmern der Zahnärzte können Sie getrost vergessen. Völlig schmerzfrei werden Ihre eventuell notwendigen Behandlungen dadurch natürlich auch nicht. Aber Sie sind ja für die Pflege Ihrer Zähne verantwortlich und können durch die häufige (möglichst tägliche) Kontrolle alle nachteiligen Veränderungen wahrnehmen und entsprechend behandeln. Die meisten Schädigungen unsers Gebisses entstehen ja nicht durch mangelnde Pflege sondern dadurch, dass wir die Gründe für die Kariesbildung nicht entdecken können. Ein Sustainer X-Chec nach der Pflege deckt sofort übersehene Verunreinigungen auf. Zahnsteinbildung wird schon im Frühstadium erkannt und kann erheblich einfacher behandelt werden.</p>

FAQ´s - Die häufig gestellten Fragen zum Produkt
Wichtig! Gegenanzeige
Der X-Chec Sustainer ist kein Ersatz für Ihre Zahnärztin oder Ihren Zahnarzt!Der X-Chec Sustainer hat nur die Funktion Sie bei der Überwachung Ihres Mundhygienezustandes zu unterstützen.In Zweifelsfällen sollten Sie immer Ihre Zahnärztin oder Ihren Zahnarzt konsultieren.
Was macht unser Produkt so besonders?
Der X-Chec Sustainer ist die erste Mundkamera mit App- Verbindung zur Kommunikation mit all Ihren elektronischen Geräten und zur Verbindung mit Ihrem Doc für eine Schnelldiagnose ohne aufwändigen Arztbesuch.Die mitgelieferte App erlaubt Ihnen die vergrößerte Übertragung Ihrer Bilder wahlweise auf Smartphone, Smartwatch, Pad, Laptop oder anderen digitalen Darstellungsgeräten (z.B. Fernseher). Die Bilder können wahlweise archiviert oder zum Beispiel auch an Ihren Arzt versendet werden.Mit der App werden Bilder mit typischen Erkrankungen der Zähne in verschiedenen Stadien geliefert , sodass Sie eine erste grobe Einschätzung haben, ob die von Ihnen festgestellten Mängel schon behandlungsfähig sind oder ob Sie noch warten können. Die endgültige Entscheidung sollte aber immer Ihre Ärztin oder Ihr Arzt fällen.

Welche Probleme löst unser Produkt?
Mit dem X-Chec Sustainer können Sie zu jeder Zeit den Gesundheitszustand Ihrer Zähne auch an den Stellen beobachten, die normalerweise nur Ihr Zahnarzt sieht.Sie können den Reinigungszustand Ihrer Zähne in jeder Ecke beurteilen. Mundgeruch kann so extrem sicher bekämpft werden.Sie müssen nicht mehr routinemäßig zum Zahnarzt, sondern nur, wenn es auch einen Anlass gibt.Sie ersparen sich unnötige Kosten, Fahr- und Wartezeit.

Wo funktioniert unser Produkt?
Ein X-Chec Sustainer ist eigentlich nichts anderes als ein Zahnarztspiegel mit angebauter Kamera und Übertragungssystem.Das im Sustainer befindliche Kamerasystem sendet die Bildinformationen via Bluetooth-Schnittstelle auf Ihre Peripheriegeräte.Im Gehäuse des X-Checkers befindet sich außerdem eine Batterie-Ladeeinheit, die per Induktion aufgeladen werden kann. Deshalb funktioniert das Gerät auch kabellos.Die W-LAN Schnittstelle hat eine Reichweite von bis zu 5 Metern. Die Bildübertragung funktioniert nur mit Ihrer persönlichen App. So ist sichergestellt, dass kein anderer die Bilder Ihres X-Checers empfangen kann!Das Ladegerät ist ein Standardcharger wie Sie es von vielen Geräten (z.B. elektrische Zahnbürste oder Munddusche) kennen.

Wo kann man unser Produkt gut gebrauchen?
Ein X-Chec Sustainer funktioniert fast überall. Sein Temperatureinsatzbereich liegt inklusive dem Ladegerät bei -10 bis +40 Grad Celsius. Er ist wasserdicht bis zu einem Meter Tauchtiefe und kann unter fließendem Wasser mit einer Temperatur von bis zu 40 Grad Celsius (Handwarm) mit einem für Kunststoff zugelassenes Reinigungsmittel gereinigt werden.Die Spiegelsysteme können bequem im kochenden Wasser sterilisiert werden.Das Ladegerät sollte nur mit für Kunststoff zugelassenem Reinigungsmittel gesäubert werden und darf keinesfalls unter fließendem Wasser gereinigt werden. Bitte nur mit einem feuchten Tuch reinigen. Bei der Reinigung des Ladegerätes ist grundsätzlich der Netzstecker zu ziehen!
Natürlich können Sie Ihren X-Chec Sustainer auch zweckentfremden um verloren gegangene Gegenstände in unzugänglichen Ecken zu suchen oder um in Geräte hineinzuschauen, die Sie mit bloßem Auge nicht erreichen können. Eine Spiegelsterilisation ist allerdings nach solchen Aktionen obligatorisch.Und selbstverständlich können Sie mit dem X-Chec Sustainer auch den Zahnzustand Ihres Lieblings bzw. Ihrer Lieblinge kontrollieren (dazu empfehlen wir allerdings einen oder mehrere weitere Spiegel (;-) und die Nutzung eines Beißholzes, damit der Spiegelhalter nicht durch einen ungewollten Kauversuch verbogen wird). Besonders Hunde mögen keinen Blick in ihr Maul (Katzen sind auch nicht besonders glücklich darüber).

Wer könnte unser Produkt brauchen?
Der X-Chec Sustainer ist für alle da.Die Zahngesundheit bei Kindern unter 14 Jahren (empfohlenes Alter) können von Mama oder Papa bequem angesehen und im Verdachtsfall vom Arzt geprüft werden.Jugendliche ab 14 prüfen Ihren Mundhygienezustand am besten selbst. So werden sie nicht von den Eltern gegängelt und Flirtprobleme lassen sich am besten verhindern!Erwachsene werden schon aus Kostengründen unsere Sustainer lieben. Eine unnütze Fahrt inklusive Wartezeit zum Arzt und der entstehenden Behandlungskosten1 holt die Anschaffungskosten schon wieder rein.Ältere Leute ersparen sich mühsame Fahrten zum Arzt und durch die Projektionsfähigkeit der Bilder auf beliebig große Bildschirme können sogar die meisten Einschränkungen bei Sehbehinderungen überbrückt werden.

Wessen Probleme löst unser Produkt?
Der X-Chec Sustainer löst einige Probleme von Ihnen und denen Ihres Arztes.Sie haben eine „wann immer ich es will“ Kontrolle Ihres Mundgesundheitszustandes, spart Ihnen unnötige Kosten, Fahr-, Warte- und Untersuchungszeiten. Damit schonen Sie sogar die Umwelt!Ihr Arzt hat keine gefüllten Wartezimmer mit Patienten, die noch keine Behandlung benötigen und hat mehr Zeit für die, die seiner Aufmerksamkeit bedürfen.Ihre Bilder kann er prüfen, wann es in seine Zeitpläne am Besten passt, Ihre Diagnose sendet er Ihnen bequem per App zurück. Er kann Ihnen gleich Terminvorschläge mitsenden, die Sie bequem per App bestätigen können.Sie entscheiden den besten Zeitpunkt für Ihre Behandlung bei Ihrem Doc. Bei Unsicherheiten können Sie sich anonym auch noch eine Gegenmeinung einholen, ohne Ihrem Arzt misstrauen zu signalisieren.
Wer möchte unser Produkt haben?
Der X-Chec Sustainer ist grundsätzlich für alle da.Vom Kleinkind bis zur Seniorin oder Senior ist es die ideale Ergänzung zur täglichen Mundhygienekontrolle.Besonders empfehlenswert ist der Cross Checker für:

Kostenbewusste
Umweltbewusste
Termingeplagte
Gesundheitsbewusste und vom Mundgeruch geplagte Menschen

Positive Effekte durch die Nutzung?
Mit einem X-Chec Sustainer entwickeln Sie das angenehme Gefühl, den Gesundheitszustand Ihrer Zähne immer unter Kontrolle zu haben. Die von den meisten Menschen empfundene Unsicherheit in den Wartezimmern der Zahnärzte können Sie getrost vergessen. Völlig schmerzfrei werden Ihre eventuell notwendigen Behandlungen dadurch natürlich auch nicht. Aber Sie sind ja für die Pflege Ihrer Zähne verantwortlich und können durch die häufige (möglichst tägliche) Kontrolle alle nachteiligen Veränderungen wahrnehmen und entsprechend behandeln. Die meisten Schädigungen unsers Gebisses entstehen ja nicht durch mangelnde Pflege sondern dadurch, dass wir die Gründe für die Kariesbildung nicht entdecken können. Ein Sustainer X-Chec nach der Pflege deckt sofort übersehene Verunreinigungen auf. Zahnsteinbildung wird schon im Frühstadium erkannt und kann erheblich einfacher behandelt werden.

SCUBA diving and using boats are great, but they're expensive, difficult to do at any point in time, not allowed with some marine animals, and it can be dangerous to SCUBA dive around other marine animals.

And that's with a stock DJI Phantom 3 with about a 2.5 pound maximum lifting capacity at sea level - with a more powerful drone there really isn't much limit to your camera weight. I'm an Aerospace Engineer with a Masters degree from Stanford University - anything that flies is my expertise.

When we were first filming with the DroneSnorkl, I only had 15 minutes of experience flying quadcopter drones. At Stanford we build autonomous, GPS guided, fixed wing UAVs - but I was never the one getting them up and flying under RC control before letting the software and electronics take over. Nonetheless, I had no problem piloting the DroneSnorkl as a novice and at very high altitudes. Though we highly recommend you spend at least an hour in a field practicing setting the DroneSnorkl down onto the surface, then picking it back up again.</p><p>A ton of very difficult engineering and problem solving went into the design of the DroneSnorkl. One of the most interesting solutions involved limiting the pendulum swing that the attachment causes while flying. At first, when trying to fly our prototypes in the real world, we found that the weight of the attachment combined with the long tether resulted an enormous pendulum swing effect that was almost avoidable after takeoff. This made it a very slow process to maneuver the drone and made it quite difficult to keep it where you want it. After hours and hours of thought and debating how on earth we could bring this under control, we finally arrived at a brilliant and incredibly simple solution - we attached a small parachute several feet up the tether from the DroneSnorkl, fixed to the tether line. This parachute is too small to cause significant pull in a light breeze, but when the system starts to swing like a pendulum, the drag of the parachute counters the swing and brings it under control! It works so well that while taking the picture seen above, we let the DJI autopilot hold the drone still while I adjusted the DroneSnorkl by hand as the drone held it suspended in midair! The autopilot could control it by itself just fine. AND at 7800 feet above sea level!</p><p>Finally, we designed optional floating landing gear for your drone to make sure that in the event of an emergency, you can safely set your drone down on the water and then use a kayak, paddle board, boat, or even swim out and get it. The landing gear are built of carbon fiber tubing to keep them lightweight (you can only add a few ounces to a system like a DJI Phantom 3) and strong. They are designed to fit the landing skids of DJI Phantom 3 and 4 drones, and probably earlier models as well, though I'm sure with a little ingenuity you can mount them to almost any drone. We ultimately have to hide the beautiful carbon fiber construction with foam to make sure they float - as any hollow plastic or similar floats are just too heavy. But the landing gear are extremely useful, very high quality, and we would never fly over water without them - knowing you aren't going to lose your drone if the battery drops while it is out over water is a huge relief.</p><p>The DroneSnorkl has two versions: DroneSnorkl LIVE includes a cable that goes through a seal in the top closure and then runs up the tether to your drone, so that you can put your drone's camera into the DroneSnorkl and see underwater LIVE from your drone! That does, however, require some slight disassembly because you must remove your camera from its gimbal and mount it in the DroneSnorkl and then connect the cable. The DroneSnorkl GoPro has a solid top closure and thus seals the camera in for use with GoPros and other cameras that are 2.5"" wide or less - such as GoPro Hero 4, GoPro Hero 5, GoPro Hero 6. </p><p>To make sure your drone stays safe over water, we created carbon fiber landing skids that widen and lengthen your drone's footprint, raise it farther away from the water, AND include floats to allow your drone to land on water in an emergency. We never fly over water without them- and recommend you don't either. Take a look at how cool they are!:</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511735175/mnhio39hxervcocdt5dz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Make sure your drone can lift at least 2 pounds - 900 grams (as DJI Phantom 3, Phantom 4 and any equivalent or more powerful drone can). Of course you should never fly in anything more than a light breeze, and should be extremely careful of waves, as powerful waves can drag the DroneSnorkl around - and it is attached to your drone. Be sure to bring the drone home while it still has plenty of charge, as it is lifting a lot more weight than it would with nothing attached. And be sure to practice and experiment to be comfortable using your drone with the DroneSnorkl attached - we aren't responsible for any damage to your drone while using DroneSnorkl, so be sure to have a good handle on using it before taking it out on difficult missions! It really is, however, quite easy to use. Just be sure to practice enough!</p><p><strong>The DroneSnorkl is a phenomenal system and quite honestly we've gotten addicted to flying it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The DBPOWER N6 is a great camera at a great price, but if you’re trying to shoot underwater video with it, you’ll quickly find that there aren’t any underwater filters available for it. I’ve searched high and low for them. I’ve wasted my money on GoPro filters that looked they might fit – they did not. I even tried modifying those GoPro filters to fit the DBPOWER N6, but gave up on that idea after I lost one of them on the first snorkel outing – there’s enough plastic in the ocean, I don’t need to add to it.</p>
<p>Without a filter, though, my videos came out decidedly blah. It was very sad indeed to watch hours of blue images float by and try to remember the beautiful colors I actually saw.</p>
<p>So, I’ve decided to take matters into my own hands and find a manufacturer to custom-make filters for the DBPOWER N6.</p>
<p>Don’t waste your money on filters that won’t fit, or worse, end up with footage that’s so far from capturing the beauty of your experience that you might as well not have shot it to begin with.</p>
<p>All goes well, we should be able to ship these by February – hopefully in time for your next trip!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This parts fairly simple. You get a set of underwater filters for your DBPOWER N6 action camera. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our funding goal, you don’t get charged. Unfortunately, you also probably won’t get filters that fit your camera. So please help us spread the word!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The key challenge once we reach our goal will be to find a quality supplier. I will procure several prototypes from different suppliers to make sure we get the best quality for our money.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us spread the word by using Indiegogo’s sharing tools!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Chasing Coral</h3>
<p>Lastly, as a fellow diver/snorkeler I cannot stress enough that you should watch Chasing Coral on Netflix.</p>
<p>It’s one of the most inspiring, beautiful, and sadly distressing documentaries I’ve watched in a long time and I sat down for hours afterwards spreading the word about it on social media and looking for ways to get involved in the fight to save our precious coral reefs.</p>
<p>If this project is successful and there’s a profit left over at the end of it, I’m committed to donating a large portion of it to help the conservation of coral reefs.</p>

The DBPOWER N6 is a great camera at a great price, but if you’re trying to shoot underwater video with it, you’ll quickly find that there aren’t any underwater filters available for it. I’ve searched high and low for them. I’ve wasted my money on GoPro filters that looked they might fit – they did not. I even tried modifying those GoPro filters to fit the DBPOWER N6, but gave up on that idea after I lost one of them on the first snorkel outing – there’s enough plastic in the ocean, I don’t need to add to it.
Without a filter, though, my videos came out decidedly blah. It was very sad indeed to watch hours of blue images float by and try to remember the beautiful colors I actually saw.
So, I’ve decided to take matters into my own hands and find a manufacturer to custom-make filters for the DBPOWER N6.
Don’t waste your money on filters that won’t fit, or worse, end up with footage that’s so far from capturing the beauty of your experience that you might as well not have shot it to begin with.
All goes well, we should be able to ship these by February – hopefully in time for your next trip!
 
What We Need & What You Get
This parts fairly simple. You get a set of underwater filters for your DBPOWER N6 action camera. 
If we do not reach our funding goal, you don’t get charged. Unfortunately, you also probably won’t get filters that fit your camera. So please help us spread the word!
 
Risks & Challenges
The key challenge once we reach our goal will be to find a quality supplier. I will procure several prototypes from different suppliers to make sure we get the best quality for our money.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Help us spread the word by using Indiegogo’s sharing tools!
 
Chasing Coral
Lastly, as a fellow diver/snorkeler I cannot stress enough that you should watch Chasing Coral on Netflix.
It’s one of the most inspiring, beautiful, and sadly distressing documentaries I’ve watched in a long time and I sat down for hours afterwards spreading the word about it on social media and looking for ways to get involved in the fight to save our precious coral reefs.
If this project is successful and there’s a profit left over at the end of it, I’m committed to donating a large portion of it to help the conservation of coral reefs.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

Warranty is only for exchange of a defective unit. No returns for refund. Are you hiring?No. The price is very low for a g3a xis camera compared with other brand. Why is that?Our dream is to make the innovation cameras accessible to everyone. We have worked long and hard to create cameras that are not only affordable, but also made of quality components. To help us bring Coolcam g3a to reality, you can get an exclusive up to 55% discount off MSRP. Technical Will there be an Android App?Yes, there is an Android and iOS APP. The APPs are ready for operation and will be released before the shipping. How do you know how much power is left in the batteries?You can see the battery status on the screen, or in the App. How do you know how much memory is remaining? You can see the remaining storage status on the screen, or in the App. Does Coolcam g3a come with a memory card?No, we are not including a memory card with your order. Will a charging cable come with Coolcam g3a?Yes, each package will include a Micro USB for charging. How many hours will Coolcam g3a last if only used for taking pictures?There are many factors and conditions to calculate this, but generally the battery life should last you for more than 1 day. Can Coolcam g3a connect to a microphone through a 3.5mm mic adapter?Coolcam g3a does not have a 3.5mm port because we are trying to keep the camera as small as possible. Can Coolcam g3a handle extreme temperatures?No. How long will it take to completely charge the internal camera battery?This depends on the type of charger you are using, but generally it will take 2 hours. What is the Battery Life (estimated time) of Coolcam g3a?Video recording with charged inner battery is estimated at 30min.

<p>We've already sold hundreds.  So, we've got the manufacturing down.  But now, we want to make them out of Carbon Fiber, and give you a customized production bag that's perfect for travel and storage of the Cinerails Track and Dolly System:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need $36K to place an order for quality carbon fiber and bags at a volume discount . When this happens, we increase the value of the product, while passing the savings on to you.</li>
<li>Many of our product users are super excited at the possibility of going high tech and getting a custom bag, but they already have the system.  No problem.  Our list of perks allows you to get only what you need.  If all you need is a bag, we have a perk for that.  Only need the carbon fiber rails, we've got ya covered.  And If you want the full system so that you can start filming like the pros, we've got you covered there too.  Plus, I'll show you how I use Cinerails to film for film and TV, and step ahead of the next guy or gal.</li>
<li>I've done this before.  Four years ago I started a campaign on Kickstarter and that's how Cinerails came about. It was a huge success, and went without a glitch.  Not only did I get Cinerails in the hands of a lot of real filmmakers, I also helped a lot of amateurs look like pros, and I've made a lot of friends who keep in touch even today.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>Every time you add something new to the process, it has to be tested and proven first:</p>

What makes stabiLens so effective?
The weight of the lens disappears as it is supported- by the stabiLens. No more unsteady hand-held shots. Here my daughter spent 5 hours at an air show taking hundreds of photos with a fairly heavy lens. She could track the planes with ease on a super steady platform.

         
The center of mass of stabiLens, balanced on the base or window set, allows you to move the camera with virtually no friction and it feels almost weightless.
 
Use in sporting events

Why stabiLens?
I  need  $29 000 to manufacture molds for a plastic injection process. At present stabiLens is hand made which is expensive and time consuming. I cannot develop an international market using this process.

The perk contributors will be among the first photographers in the USA and Europe to receive this proven product at a discount of at least 30%.

stabiLens has been field tested and is in production and does not need a long development process.

stabiLens is a proven concept and is selling well in South Africa and in smaller numbers around the world.
Photographers are excited about how easy it is to use and that it is inexpensive. The closest comparison to stabiLens would be a gimbal based product which normally costs hundreds of dollars and takes time to set up.

stabiLens is ready to use in a matter of seconds on a car window or on a tripod, a monopod or on any flat surface.
There is virtually no risk in investing in this product as stabiLens has been in production for 2 years and has undergone a number of modifications to meet photographer requirements. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.
Injection molding will allow me to manufacture to tight tolerances and will simplify the assembly process. It will also allow me to cater for large order numbers.
Even if you cannot contribute, but like the idea, ask your photographer friends to check out this campaign.

<h3>The magic of View-Master</h3>
<p>Do you remember View-Master? You know, those viewers with the round paper reels that traveled you all over the world through their tiny little 3D slide pictures.....</p>
<p> Did you, or do you yet have one?</p>
<p><strong>View-Master</strong>* has been around for more than 75 years, exciting children and adults with its ""come to life"" 3D pictures.</p>
<p>It was introduced back in 1939 as a means of showing scenic 3D photographs and since then, thousands of places have been depicted on its reels.</p>
<p>In the course of time, more and variable themes were added to its library (fairy tales, movies, educational etc) and a group of dedicated fans and collectors developed around the world.</p>
<p>Now, new,  improved viewers and reels are being manufactured under the strictest standards of quality in new facilities and with modern equipment (we are talking about the original View-Master, not some kind of replica). </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are independent producers and, in coordination with the company that currently manufactures the View-Master*, we aim to produce a series of new 3 reel packets (scenic and others), in an effort to keep alive the View-Master tradition worldwide.</p>
<p>On that, we have gathered together a group of skilled 3D photographers and other artists who share our passion about this beloved ""toy"".</p>
<p><i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">*View-Master is a trandmark of Fisher-Price/Mattel and everything we do is/or will be under licence and approval of them</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span></i></p>

</div></div>","The magic of View-Master
Do you remember View-Master? You know, those viewers with the round paper reels that traveled you all over the world through their tiny little 3D slide pictures.....
 Did you, or do you yet have one?
View-Master* has been around for more than 75 years, exciting children and adults with its ""come to life"" 3D pictures.
It was introduced back in 1939 as a means of showing scenic 3D photographs and since then, thousands of places have been depicted on its reels.
In the course of time, more and variable themes were added to its library (fairy tales, movies, educational etc) and a group of dedicated fans and collectors developed around the world.
Now, new,  improved viewers and reels are being manufactured under the strictest standards of quality in new facilities and with modern equipment (we are talking about the original View-Master, not some kind of replica). 
 
About us
We are independent producers and, in coordination with the company that currently manufactures the View-Master*, we aim to produce a series of new 3 reel packets (scenic and others), in an effort to keep alive the View-Master tradition worldwide.
On that, we have gathered together a group of skilled 3D photographers and other artists who share our passion about this beloved ""toy"".
*View-Master is a trandmark of Fisher-Price/Mattel and everything we do is/or will be under licence and approval of them.
 
About this packet
This 3reel packet is about the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Delphi, the imposing archaelogical site of the famous oracle of antiquity in Greece.
It will be part of a series of packets we plan to produce, about the most prominent UNESCO World Heritage sites and monuments of the world.
Initialy produced for the Greek Organization that operated the museum gift shop -until it ceased its operation- this packet depicts in 21 glorious 3D photographs, the main monuments of the site and the museum.
After a lot of adventures and changes in production process (we should write a book sometime about this:), we are back and ask you to help us accomplish this project.  
              

 
What We Need
This is one of the most expencive scenic packets to produce.
Here's a cost calculation:
$52,500 production cost for 10,000 pcs (including rights fees and taxes)

$6,000 cost of the prize (a trip to Greece) for our refferal contest winner 
$8,700 indiegogo and transaction fees charges
This is an all or nothing campaign for the production of 10,000 3reel packets.
They may, or may not be re-issued in the future, so, this is the chance for you to obtain a piece of culture (on location they'll be sold at least $15,00).
 
What You Get

3. For $10,00 pledging you get one Delphi 3reel packet, shipped to your address, plus of course the chance to win the trip to Greece, by winning our contest!  
4. This is for companies: for $6,000 you'll have your advertisement/logo placed permanently on the rare side of the reels!! In contrast of other printing matterials,View-Master reels are made to last, and your message will be around for decades!! Also, your company's logo will feature prominently on our campaign page, as the official sponsor of the project.

<h3>What you need to use the Battery Handle?</h3>
<p>You will need the following things:</p>
<p>1 x battery handle (which you get here with the campaign)</p>
<p>4 or 3 x 18650 ion lithium batteries (button top).  You can order these <a href=""https://www.18650batterystore.com/Button-top-p/panasonic-ncr18650b-button-top.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<p>1 x battery charger. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com.au/Display-Universal-INLIFE-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B07G77NNPB/ref=sr_1_29?keywords=18650+battery+charger&amp;qid=1554171360&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here is the charger</a> I use, but there are a lot of chargers available.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554172227/xilzipfgdupi600hinc4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The battery pack is a complete power solution and I recommend you get one (or the 9000mAh Battery Shell) for each device you wish to power. To expand your storage needs you only need to buy additional 18650 batteries which greatly reduces these cost of powering your equipment.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> the standard batteries I have suggested can support any 2 of the power ports at the same time because the batteries have a maximum discharge of 4.85A.  If you want to power all of the ports at the same time you can purchase<a href=""https://www.18650batterystore.com/product-p/lg-mj1-button-top.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> higher discharge batteries here. </a></p>
<h3>A word of caution about batteries</h3>
<p>Like so many products, there are fake and low quality batteries out there.  Only buy batteries from reputable sources and only buy a decent quality charger.  Batteries listed as 'protected' are better as they have built in safe guards. Protected aren't absolutely necessary as long as you use a quality charger that has overcharge protection and if you recharge the batteries when the battery pack's indicator starts flashing red.  As soon as you get a new set of batteries, charge them up (they should read 4.2V) and then run them on the camera.  If they last less than say 2.75 hours for a 3400mAh battery, then send them back.  Find a good source and stick with them.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>Why 18650 batteries</h3>
<p>These little power houses are widely available, inexpensive and have a high capacity.  Tesla has been using these little batteries in their cars and power walls.  As an example, <a href=""https://www.18650batterystore.com/Protected-p/panasonic-18650-protected.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4x Panasonic 18650 </a>cells cost under $30 and provide  up to 13,000mAh capacity - making this type of power solution more affordable than other solutions (equal to five LP6 batteries).  The plus side is you can replace individual cells if one degrades faster than the rest, rather than having to replace the entire unit.  <a href=""https://www.18650batterystore.com/Protected-p/panasonic-18650-protected.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">These are the particular batteries I recommend</a> as they have protection circuitry built in.</p>
<h3>Bonus Goal</h3>
<p>I have also developed a 9000mAh Battery Shell for use with devices where the handles are too big to fit.  If I reach $24,000, then I will enable an additional perk so you can get your hands on this useful addition.  The battery shell holds 3x 18650 batteries, has a large charge indicator, a 7V 2.5A dc out, and will include NPF and LP battery plates. </p>

<p>I like to make stuff and I like to write and shoot films.  For the past two years, I've been making and selling remotes for the Blackmagic Micro Cinema camera (see below image) and now that I've bought the new BMPCC4K I'm making new things that I need for filming and that I'm sure other people will appreciate. I'm self taught in electronics, 3d industrial design, circuit board design and getting from prototypes to manufacturing. The money I've made from my remotes I've invested in my garage workshop, building copious amounts of prototypes, and hiring specialists to check and improve my designs. The things I make are pretty niche but I think this battery handle is unique and useful enough to have a wider appeal. We shall see!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555018192/jozfufutzgoq4a2p2v3s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>What is needed and what's in it for you</h3>
<p>Because the design is molded plastic and includes aluminium components and a circuit board, I need to get a lot made in order to keep the costs down. I've sourced the suppliers, all of whom I have already dealt with for my remotes, and I've made and tested the prototype.  All I need now is to get the minimum quantity made. </p>
<p>Because everything needs to be made at once, I'm offering a single, finished, professional quality product with included accessories.  These are:</p>
<p>1 x Battery Handle (either 9000mAh or 13000mAh)</p>
<p>1 x Canon LPN dummy battery plate</p>
<p>1 x Sony NPF dummy battery plate</p>
<p>1 x power cable for Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4k or a 5.5x2.1mm male to 5.5x2.1mm male cable</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I need you</h3>
<p>My work is purely small-scale for niche markets.  This product is something that can't be made on a case by case basis and requires a sizeable amount of cash up front - cash I do not possess.  Without your contribution this product won't be feasible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am supremely confident that this project will be completed to spec and on time.  I've been producing items for the past two years and I've formed good relationships with the companies and people that will be building the components.  I've spent a lot of time designing and redesigning this product. I am familiar with the costs for running the campaign and getting the product made and shipped.  I have ensured that all those costs are covered, plus a little extra  buffer - for the unforeseen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The most important thing is to spread the word.  There is so much going on all the time, it is easy for small players like myself to go unseen.  </p>

If you are interested in my current work, check out my website onelittlegoat.com.

What is needed and what's in it for you
Because the design is molded plastic and includes aluminium components and a circuit board, I need to get a lot made in order to keep the costs down. I've sourced the suppliers, all of whom I have already dealt with for my remotes, and I've made and tested the prototype.  All I need now is to get the minimum quantity made. 
Because everything needs to be made at once, I'm offering a single, finished, professional quality product with included accessories.  These are:
1 x Battery Handle (either 9000mAh or 13000mAh)
1 x Canon LPN dummy battery plate
1 x Sony NPF dummy battery plate
1 x power cable for Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4k or a 5.5x2.1mm male to 5.5x2.1mm male cable

Why I need you
My work is purely small-scale for niche markets.  This product is something that can't be made on a case by case basis and requires a sizeable amount of cash up front - cash I do not possess.  Without your contribution this product won't be feasible. 

Risks & Challenges
I am supremely confident that this project will be completed to spec and on time.  I've been producing items for the past two years and I've formed good relationships with the companies and people that will be building the components.  I've spent a lot of time designing and redesigning this product. I am familiar with the costs for running the campaign and getting the product made and shipped.  I have ensured that all those costs are covered, plus a little extra  buffer - for the unforeseen.

Other Ways You Can Help
The most important thing is to spread the word.  There is so much going on all the time, it is easy for small players like myself to go unseen.",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>In the last few years<strong> film photography has been growing in popularity</strong> for the first time since the 1990s. After digital photography came, the entire infrastructure supporting film photography shriveled up and nearly vanished completely. But today film has found a new relevance not only with those who enjoyed it in the past but to a whole new iPhone only generation. With this renewed interest, but no supporting infrastructure, there are problems arising. Almost all film cameras need servicing or repairing to keep going, and for 20 years very few have repaired their film cameras. Now we<strong> need to act to reach a sustainable situation</strong> with film cameras and that is why the Camera Rescue Project was created. If you are unaware of the project I suggest watching this <a href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=uQAqSQOK_gc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mini documentary</a> or browsing through the <a href=""http://instagram.com/camerarescue"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">instagram feed</a>.</p><p>--</p><p>During the last 9 years at the Camera Rescue project we have sourced and diagnosed over <a href=""http://camerarescue.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">70 000 cameras</a> in Finland. Starting from one camera a day in the beginning, to about 100 cameras a day during the previous four months. And with all that has happened during this process, we have learned a great deal about what is the world of film cameras in 2020. This knowledge we want to now share with the global analog photography community.<br/><br/><strong>Why share secrets we have taken years to learn?</strong></p><p>Well there are two reasons.</p><p> </p><p><strong>1. We have no time to waste.</strong><br/>A few years ago there was 100 million film cameras in Europe alone unused, but the amount is diminishing by the day as 99% of the people do not care for analog photography and are typically unaware that there is a modern demand for these vintage items. In addition to cameras being tossed into garbage, from the ones that can be found in Europe around 80% are not working properly. Most of them can still be revived with proper care, or atleast used for parts. <strong>You might be the only person in your town that is looking to preserve film cameras </strong>and to rescue your towns cameras for the use of the community in the future, the cameras need to find their way to you.<br/><br/>When I started using and buying film cameras over a decade ago, the percentage of film cameras with problems was less than 10% (at least in Finland). The change to 80% being out of factory standards is drastic. If we want film photography to sustain itself in the following decades - we need to have 2-5 million working cameras in Europe alone. The number of working cameras is important because creating such a wealth of camera variety we have available now, will never be economically possible by making new cameras. And most likely new cameras entering the market in the future will be nowhere near as affordable as the options now.</p><p>Even if all the people working in Finland around this project would do all the tricks and growthhacks in the world, we cannot achieve to rescue several millions of cameras before it is too late. For the film market to be sustainable, rescuing cameras needs to be done by <strong>many many more people</strong> around the world.</p><p><a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579000377/gtafovinjjnaflklj0tm.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579010258/r5jbggmvc3hkusxno5xr.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><strong>2. We failed at our first attempt of making a global solution</strong><br/><br/>One of the goals when we setup the Camera Rescue project was to find not only solutions for Finland or the Nordics, but scalable solutions that could be used by the community globally. Naturally, like any millennials, we thought it would best be done by creating an app. Sadly we are not coders and even worse at picking coding companies to work for us. </p><p>Our first idea was to multiply our knowhow through an app that would connect people that haven't used their film camera in decades to people and companies that want film cameras. It’s already past the two year mark from what was supposed to be the beta release date. <strong>We have run out of both patience and funds</strong> on this and have decided we probably have reached the point where its time to move on and<strong> label it as a fail</strong> and a valuable learning experience.

As I have hunted for cameras in three continents and all types of situations during the last decade, I can confirm the course will be universally applicable - not just a series of tips for Finland. The sections covered will be:</p><ol>
<li>Why would you want to rescue cameras?</li>
<li>What to look for? Part A - The Cameras</li>
<li>What to look for? Part B - The Condition of a Camera</li>
<li>Where to look for hidden cameras? (Online and in the real world)</li>
<li>What can I repair in a camera?</li>
<li>Where and how to sell cameras?</li>
</ol><p> </p><p><strong>The goal of the course and how we will get there</strong><br/><br/>To really understand how the whole Camera Rescue process works and how you could do it too, there would be at least 12-15 distinct video classes. All made in the same production quality as the kickstarter video above, but at a slower more appropriate pace.<br/><br/>The majority of the classes will focus on the only mistake that really matters, but that you will keep making - knowing the condition of the camera. <strong>Most of us are so old, that our natural reaction to a film camera is to expect it to work.</strong> That is not the case in 2020 anymore, but it is a very hard habit to kick.<br/><br/>With help from <a href=""http://cameramakers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cameramakers</a>, the camera repair team in our project with over 50 years of experience repairing cameras, we will go through all the main analog camera types and show you why and how they notice the flaw of cameras with their actual testing machinery. Cameramakers have perfected the art of condition checking so far, that they make mistakes in less than 1 out of 300 cameras. Then we go through the best practices of what you can do to mimic the process, without such machinery.<br/><br/>The main goal is that <strong>you will not buy a faulty camera again</strong>, without knowing it is faulty. This is important because knowing if a camera is working will enable you know exactly what you should or should not pay for it.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579001370/d50h3nxfarkb9mh1tgik.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p><strong>The budget</strong><br/><br/>Making these videos will disrupt many of our daily processes, but as I stated above we cannot keep analog photography alive if the amount of cameras circulating worldwide is not big enough.  However it would be good to cover the expenses of the video productions - to keep both the quality high and actually get these out there faster than if we would do also editing etc ourselves.<br/><br/>We have a quote for the 15 video course from a production company that is sympathetic to the cause. To that we have to add taxes and the crowdfunding website fees, but all in all we can go ahead with the course if we reach 15 000€.

</ul><p><br/><strong>Timetables</strong><br/><br/>We are entering a very hectic 2020 with the Camera Rescue project. We still aim to rescue 100 000 cameras by the end of the year and it means we should process about 30 000 cameras in 12 months. That will mean search tours around Europe, taking part in fairs, hiring a big summer team, looking for additional space to process all the cameras etc.<br/><br/>But January still seems relatively slow and the first two weeks of February too. So I could record these lessons then and release them one by one once they come out of the editing room. Later in the year there will be no time to record this course and I believe many of you want to get going rescuing cameras in your own area sooner rather than later. With the funding all lessons should be recorded within a month of the end of this campaign and start coming out by late February.</p><p><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The risks</strong></p><p>This is not the first time I am doing a photography related YouTube series. Quite a while ago I founded <a href=""http://kamerakoulu.fi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kamerakoulu.fi</a> - An Online Photography School in Finnish and did a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWP1icn-VJ6bA8csQHrU8r0uFisUEsWj"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube basic course of 14 lessons</a> in Finnish. Six years later the technical quality and knowhow would now be much better, the homework would be a bit more complex than posting photos on Flickr (it was <strong>the place</strong> in 2013) and the content would be perfected with the masters of each area from <a href=""http://cameramakers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cameramakers.com</a> or <a href=""http://kamerastore.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kamerastore.com</a>. So in short - the risks of us not delivering what promised with the funding - should be almost none if I am not hit by a bus.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Why should I support?</strong></h3><p>This course is aimed to keep as many cameras away from dumpsters or electronic recycling as possible. The more cameras we have in circulation, the better the future of film looks like. And having more cameras in the market means the prices will remain lower for longer. In addition even the most experienced camera nerds will benefit from these two things:</p><ol>
<li>Going through the basics systematically is always good. If one little trick saves you from paying for a lemon, you will be thankful that you took the course. Every film photographer I know, including myself, has made a bad camera purchase they couldn’t undo and lost money because of it.</li>
<li> We want new people to come to film photography, so that film manufacturing is viable. If they need to buy 3 or 4 cameras before they actually find one that gives them results, they will quit before they even started. By helping funding the course, the free material will be available online for all - newcomers now and in years to come can use it to find their way into the camera world.</li>
</ol><p> </p><h3><strong>Other ways to help</strong></h3><p><br/><strong>Spreading the word is actually the main help you can give to this project. </strong>As a course about film cameras has never been available online, I honestly cannot say if there is an interest online for this type of material. If you would like to see it become a reality - please do take action.<br/><br/>I am so excited that the camera rescue project could help the analog photography scene globally with this course and am very grateful for all the support!<br/> </p><p><br/><br/>PS. There is more info about the perks in the FAQ</p></div>","In the last few years film photography has been growing in popularity for the first time since the 1990s. After digital photography came, the entire infrastructure supporting film photography shriveled up and nearly vanished completely. But today film has found a new relevance not only with those who enjoyed it in the past but to a whole new iPhone only generation. With this renewed interest, but no supporting infrastructure, there are problems arising. Almost all film cameras need servicing or repairing to keep going, and for 20 years very few have repaired their film cameras. Now we need to act to reach a sustainable situation with film cameras and that is why the Camera Rescue Project was created. If you are unaware of the project I suggest watching this mini documentary or browsing through the instagram feed.--During the last 9 years at the Camera Rescue project we have sourced and diagnosed over 70 000 cameras in Finland. Starting from one camera a day in the beginning, to about 100 cameras a day during the previous four months. And with all that has happened during this process, we have learned a great deal about what is the world of film cameras in 2020. This knowledge we want to now share with the global analog photography community.Why share secrets we have taken years to learn?Well there are two reasons. 1. We have no time to waste.A few years ago there was 100 million film cameras in Europe alone unused, but the amount is diminishing by the day as 99% of the people do not care for analog photography and are typically unaware that there is a modern demand for these vintage items. In addition to cameras being tossed into garbage, from the ones that can be found in Europe around 80% are not working properly. Most of them can still be revived with proper care, or atleast used for parts. You might be the only person in your town that is looking to preserve film cameras and to rescue your towns cameras for the use of the community in the future, the cameras need to find their way to you.When I started using and buying film cameras over a decade ago, the percentage of film cameras with problems was less than 10% (at least in Finland). The change to 80% being out of factory standards is drastic. If we want film photography to sustain itself in the following decades - we need to have 2-5 million working cameras in Europe alone. The number of working cameras is important because creating such a wealth of camera variety we have available now, will never be economically possible by making new cameras. And most likely new cameras entering the market in the future will be nowhere near as affordable as the options now.Even if all the people working in Finland around this project would do all the tricks and growthhacks in the world, we cannot achieve to rescue several millions of cameras before it is too late. For the film market to be sustainable, rescuing cameras needs to be done by many many more people around the world.2. We failed at our first attempt of making a global solutionOne of the goals when we setup the Camera Rescue project was to find not only solutions for Finland or the Nordics, but scalable solutions that could be used by the community globally. Naturally, like any millennials, we thought it would best be done by creating an app. Sadly we are not coders and even worse at picking coding companies to work for us. Our first idea was to multiply our knowhow through an app that would connect people that haven't used their film camera in decades to people and companies that want film cameras. It’s already past the two year mark from what was supposed to be the beta release date. We have run out of both patience and funds on this and have decided we probably have reached the point where its time to move on and label it as a fail and a valuable learning experience. And before you email me with solution provider info, I don't even want to think about the app world for now.But as I have been pondering on what to do next, I got to thinking about what I can actually do. My grandfather was a teacher, my mother and father both have been teachers, and as I have been sharing information about photography online for my whole life I think it is fair to say that I have an ability to teach as well. In October I asked the CR instagram followers what they thought of the idea of a basic course online and as the response was so positive here we are crowdfunding the execution.Here is some of the team working in the project this September in front of the Rescue Center in Tampere Finland that houses the main operations. What will you learn?This course will teach you all the basics so that you can rescue cameras.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jeff Whiting, and a few months ago I began a journey to expand my photography hobby in a unique direction. With my <strong>Mavic Mini </strong>drone, I started to get unique images captured that offered uncommon views of the local area. It was a lot of fun, and I have aspirations of eventually turning it into a commercial endeavor. Unfortunately, a few weeks ago I got a little risky with a shot and the unit disconnected and crashed in a place that I was not able to recover it from.</p>
<p>I very much would like to get back into the air and continue my journey to go higher, see farther, and share my aerial adventures with others. I've built an Instagram following of over a thousand users and am running out of new content to post.</p>
<p>Droning is a fairly challenging hobby to be involved in. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Crashing is an unfortunate occurrence, and I experienced it fairly early in my progression. The sooner I can get back to flying, the better pilot I’ll be in the long run. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A new <strong>Mavic Mini</strong> will set me back a little over $400. Anything I get will go toward the purchase of a new drone. If, by some miracle, more was raised, I would get the Fly-More combo with the extra batteries and prop guards. I could also use a new SD card, since I lost the last one, as it was inside the drone. If I raise less than the amount needed, I’ll hold it while I raise the rest, but it will only be used for the purchase of a new drone.</p>
<p>As a thank-you for contributing, you can get some high-res versions of the photo work I’ve already done in the form of a comic-style book and poster prints, which are suitable for framing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It’s hard to be a drone pilot without a drone! Taking the next step to resuming taking pictures in the air starts here. Eventually I would like the hobby to become commercial enough that it will be self-sustaining.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is little to no risk at all with this project. I already have a large library of aerial photos captured and processed, so I just need to arrange them in a book format. I’ll use the same printer who does my comic books. If you make a contribution, the cost of the printed good is covered, and you will receive them.</p>

<p><u><strong>Short Summary</strong></u></p>
<p>Hi, My name is Jack Avon, you will likely see from my online profiles that I have done many things, worked in finance, played competitive sports, written books amongst others. What you may not see is that I have always been an avid photographer all my life, and self confessed gadget guy. I love electronic compenants, I like cameras, I like mobile phones. Now I have become an electronics technician and decided to start my own business fixing standalone cameras and also mobile phones from all systems. So I get to do all the stuff I love, whilst making sure I do something for people.</p>
<p>This campaign is so important to me because it signals the final change and completion of my life aims. Which is be involved in fixing stuff like camera and phones, and to work with people all around the world giving them something they may have felt they lost.

Hi, My name is Jack Avon, you will likely see from my online profiles that I have done many things, worked in finance, played competitive sports, written books amongst others. What you may not see is that I have always been an avid photographer all my life, and self confessed gadget guy. I love electronic compenants, I like cameras, I like mobile phones. Now I have become an electronics technician and decided to start my own business fixing standalone cameras and also mobile phones from all systems. So I get to do all the stuff I love, whilst making sure I do something for people.
This campaign is so important to me because it signals the final change and completion of my life aims. Which is be involved in fixing stuff like camera and phones, and to work with people all around the world giving them something they may have felt they lost. Having the commercial, financial and technical experience to run such a business is fine, but I will need to establish a working physical workshop which needs to be equipped with the repair and testing tools.
This is where I am thanking you for your contribution to making this dream happen. I am firmly convinced that it will become the most well known and preferred reapair shop globally in a matter of a few years, and I would sincerely like to have you with me on that journey.

<h4><b>What is Halo 360°?</b></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Halo 360° is a 
patent-pending, revolutionary new device for law enforcement that 
consists of multiple high-definition wide lens video cameras with an 
internal hard drive and streaming features to capture a continuous 360° 
video recording.  This device is manufactured with the ultimate goal of 
creating full accountability by recording every interaction, routine and
 non-routine, between the general public and police.  This is achieved by 
the following standard features, that can be upgraded if need be to 
include:</p>
<p>	Standard Features:
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>High-definition 360° video recording</li>
<li>Voice Recognition</li>
<li>Remote video and audio streaming</li>

<h4><b>Why do we need Halo 360°?</b></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recent events in 
Ferguson, New York City and Baltimore underscore the need for unbiased, 
tamper proof photographic evidence of all incidences.  This protects the
 individuals, witnesses, and police officers by removing any 
undercurrent of bias that plagues the system and subsequent testimony.  
By providing an accurate recording, all parties are protected and 
details corroborated that could be missed in a high stress environment. 
 Safety is the number one priority for all parties, and thus Halo 360° 
offers voice recognition to key phrases, allowing for back up or 
ambulance services to be notified.  Dispatch will be able to actively 
monitor all situations remotely, allowing for quick reaction if needed. 
To further aid in communication, safety, and translational barriers 
between law enforcement and the public.</p>

In short, everybody benefits from Halo 360°.  Safety and accountability 
for both the public and law enforcement is paramount and Halo 360° will 
provide an independent means of achieving this ultimate goal.  By 
creating a device that captures unbiased data via video, all parties’ 
rights and testimonies are protected and further corroborated.  Both 
audio and visual recordings would be admissible in court, allowing for 
potentially irrefutable proof of innocence or guilt.  In lines with our 
business mission statement, a portion of the revenue will be donated to 
the families of police officers killed in the line of duty, and 
community projects.</p>

<h4>Obstacles and how we plan to over come them:</h4>
<ul>
Obstacle One:<br/><br/>Hiring developers to help out with software design for Halo 360°. To develop the protocol to run the remote connection from the Police Dispatch Headquarters. We plan to overcome this by contacting the best developers for our software’s needs to develop all the key features of Halo 360°. This includes the voice recognition feature as well.<br/><br/>Obstacle Two:<br/><br/>Light pollution from the extremely bright police emergency lights on the roof of the car.We plan on using lens’ hoods to factor out light where we can and decide optimal mounting areas per police car emergency lights set-ups. Plus, an opaque housing for Halo 360° to reduce light pollution.<br/><br/>Obstacle Three:<br/><br/>Mounting apparatus to be able to mount onto existing or in the process of being built police cars. Depending on the set-up of the police car, different police cars have different emergency lights. We will work to develop a “universal” mount that can be used on all police cars.<br/>

Any features required by military use will be complied with



Obstacles and how we plan to over come them:

Obstacle One:Hiring developers to help out with software design for Halo 360°. To develop the protocol to run the remote connection from the Police Dispatch Headquarters. We plan to overcome this by contacting the best developers for our software’s needs to develop all the key features of Halo 360°. This includes the voice recognition feature as well.Obstacle Two:Light pollution from the extremely bright police emergency lights on the roof of the car.We plan on using lens’ hoods to factor out light where we can and decide optimal mounting areas per police car emergency lights set-ups. Plus, an opaque housing for Halo 360° to reduce light pollution.Obstacle Three:Mounting apparatus to be able to mount onto existing or in the process of being built police cars. Depending on the set-up of the police car, different police cars have different emergency lights. We will work to develop a “universal” mount that can be used on all police cars.

Final Thought:
Inventifi and it's team would like to extend our hand. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or additional features you would like to share and see added to Halo 360°, please feel free to contact us.
Also, please come visit us at Inventifi, look around, and see what we are all about.
Thank you for your continued support.
 Other Ways You Can Help If you can't donate, please...  Make some noise about Halo 360°.
 Share Halo 360° on all social media venues.
Tell your local Police Department about us.
Tell your local news station.
Spread the word about Halo 360°.


Personal Message from the CEO:
Inventifi and it's team decided to come to Indiegogo because of the reputation and reach that Indiegogo has. We believe that it's members want to see new and exciting ideas being introduced that can truly have an impact. That is why we decided to go with ""All-or-Nothing"" funding platform, also known as ""Fixed"". We did this because we don't believe in just taking your hard earned money, and not providing you with a finished product. For instance, if we were to get $50,000 dollars, we wouldn't be able to deliver our promise to you...a finished product called Halo 360°. With your help, we will change the world of law enforcement. If you have any questions about how something works, or just want more clarification, please email me personally at solutions@inventifi.com. Again, on behalf of Inventifi and it's team, we thank you for the continued support we have gotten so far, and will continue to get.
An Immense Thank You,
-James Lackemeyer Inventifi CEO

<h3>What is CamScan and how it was created</h3>
<p>Like many people that happened to hold a camera in their hands in the time of ""analog"" photography, I ended up with a couple of shoe boxes full of film rolls and some envelopes with cut film. Some of the images were printed but quite significant amount never were. And I thought: ""What should i do to make it all digital?"". I tried small cheap film scanners with no success. Then I tried a dedicated flatbed scanner which, according to reviews, should have produced good results. The quality of the scans was indeed pretty good but there were quite some drawbacks: I got overexposed scans and I couldn't influence it, i couldn't shoot in RAW and it was tremendously slow. It took about five minutes to get one good scan.</p>
<p>I was almost ready to send my films to some specialized service which would cost me a lot but then I thought: ""Hang on! I have a good digital camera. Why don't I use it to scan my films?""</p>
<p>It was not a completely novel idea but none of the devices I found on the internet seemed good enough to make me buy it.</p>After some research, tests and brainstorms with friends I came up with a device that converts a camera into a film scanner.<p>These are the key features that this device has:</p>
<p>- It is very fast</p>
<p>- It keeps the film firmly in focus</p>
<p>- It provides great quality scans (as good as your camera)</p>
<p>- It features a high quality LED light source with a great CRI</p>
<p>- The film is firmly clamped which help to keep the negative in focus</p>
<p>- You have full control over exposure and color (shooting in RAW)</p>
<p>- It is compact and you can disassemble to make it even more compact for storage</p>
<p>- There is no need to send your precious negatives anywhere</p>
<p>- No messing with frames</p>
<p>- No need to cut film rolls</p>
<h3>About speed and quality</h3>
<p>No doubt that a professional film scanner would do a great job both quality- and speed-wise. However prices of such devices start at about 500 euro and sky is the limit. Sending you negatives to be scanned is an option too but, if you have many of them, you are going to spend hundreds of euros for this service.</p>
<p>Simple and cheap (from 40 to 100 euro) table-top scanners are pretty fast if you don't count the time you need to squeeze you film into a plastic frame. But the quality of scans is unsurprisingly crappy. </p>
<p>Dedicated flatbed scanners (those with a special adapters to scan films) are not so bad quality-wise since the resolution is usually decent. But the speed is nothing but disappointment - five minutes to scan a single negative. And you have the trouble of plastic frames here as well.</p>
<p>With CamScan your scan is as good as your camera-lens combination. You shoot fast because it's nothing more than just pressing a button.</p>
<p>Below you can see the very same negative scanned in three ways.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A prototype is already built and tested. Now we only need to make a few finishing touches and get enough backers to start producing the CamScan.</p>
<p>Be sure that your camera fulfills the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to shoot in RAW</li>
<li>Has a standard tripod mount centrally located with respect to the lens. Basically the mount must be right under the lens optical center when you look at your camera from the front.</li>
<li>Is able to focus at 16-27 cm from the tripod mount. And being at this distance it should have a standard film frame (36x24mm) occupying a significant part of the field of view. These two requirements mean either a macro lens or a macro-ring with auto-focus. I personally use this combination: Canon EOS 700D; EF 50mm 1:1.8 STM lens; 12mm auto-focus extension ring.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use your smartphone if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it can shoot in RAW; iPhone 6s and above with iOS10 and above has it for sure; several Android phones can do it too: just <a href=""https://www.google.nl/search?dcr=0&amp;q=Android+phones+that+take+RAW+photos&amp;oq=Android+phones+that+take+RAW+photos&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.2641.2641.0.3159.1.1.0.0.0.0.83.83.1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.83.wqW5igaLUyY&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=6m6sWdeJDsfRwALSn5SwAw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">google ""Android phones that take RAW photos""</a>
</li>
<li>it can focus at 6 to 14 cm from a subject having a standard negative (36x24mm) occupying most of the final digital image. Most of smartphones can focus at this distance but many have a enough zoom. You will need a clamp-on macro lens to to achieve a good optical zoom. Alternatively you can use you phone ""as is"" and crop images afterwards which will inevitably cost you some quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan using your smartphone don't forget to order a smartphone adapter together with your CamScan.</p>
<p>You will also need some editing software able to open RAW images, invert colors and edit RGB channels. LightRoom, Photoshop or Capture One are just right for the job but there are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format#Free_and_open_source_software"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">other programs around</a> having this functionality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The ""why""</h3>
<p>The glorious era of film photography is gone or, at least, is about to end. I find it important that the best images from the past make it to the new digital world.</p>
<p>Everybody with film rolls in a shoe box is invited to back this project and get CamScan in return. It's good stuff!</p>

<p><strong>P.P.S. A little explanation on different configurations</strong></p>
<p>The most complete option - <strong>""CamScan LED + film drum"" </strong>- has all you might need scanning 35mm film and slides. There is a built-in LED and a handy drum for film rolls. </p>
<p>The <strong>""CamScan LED""</strong> has the same but the drum. Choose this one if all or most of your films are cut in stripes.</p>
<p>Another two options - <strong>""CamScan Bare""</strong> and<strong> ""CamScan Bare + film drum""</strong> are the same as the two above but they don't have a built-in light source. You might prefer one of these two options if you have a source already (an external flash, for example) or you plan to use natural light.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to scan 120-film, you need to order <strong> ""Clamp + drum for MF""</strong> or<strong>  ""Clamp + drum for MF""</strong> additionally.</p>
<p>Same holds for the <strong>""Smartphone adapter""</strong> -  it is an extra option.</p>

Rendering error?Let's face it. Backing up, transferring, and organizing media files is a constant hassle for people in the creative field.You’re on location, trying to move with ease, yet your gear bag is stuffed to the brim with hard disks, a cumbersome laptop, and more. And then there’s the long wait for your media to transcode … it’s a process designed to kill the creative spirit.Well, no more.With this groundbreaking, portable device, we’re giving you back your creative freedom. Octoplus eliminates the complicated file backup and transcoding processes you’ve forced yourself to accept, enabling you to safely and efficiently store your valuable footage and precious memories on the go — without a computer or a smartphone.So leave the laptop at home. Stop buying SD cards after SD cards. The Octoplus simplifies everything, empowering you to focus on your creativity. Our singular mission is to keep your data safe and fully intact. That’s why the Octoplus features dual SSD slots for RAID 1 redundancy backup, ensuring your files stay secure and uncorrupted, no matter what. As an added precaution, BLAKE2 Checksum Integration uses a hash algorithm to guarantee error-free copies. Thanks to its high-performance SSDs, the Octoplus can transfer data at a rate of up to 2100MB per second — that means it only takes one minute to back up 128 GB! And if you need to use the integrated UHS-II SD card reader, you can still transfer files at a rate of up to 312 MB per second. Traditional backup methods tend to only allow for one device to be backed up at a time. The Octoplus steps past that old way of thinking. With this device, you can back up as many as 6 devices at once with the 4 USB ports and the 2 internal SSDs, saving you time, energy, and sanity. There’s no such thing as “running out of space” when you have the Octoplus — it offers up to 4 TB of SSD storage! Plus, the device features three USB-C and one USB-A port for any specific drive you need to connect to it. And, if you ever need more space than that, simply switch the Octoplus to “Extend Mode” to double your internal SSD storage (an option that eliminates the built-in redundancy). There’s no reason to ever settle for codecs you don’t want. The Octoplus supports more than 13 codecs in six container formats, and you can even render proxy wherever you are, saving you valuable time. The Octoplus gives you the freedom to lighten your load. With an integrated SD card reader and four extra USB ports (USB-C, USB-A, Thunderbolt 3, and DisplayPort over USB-C), you can pack far fewer dongles and accessories, opening up more space for your creativity. We realize creatives like to do things their own way. That’s why we built the Octoplus with fully customizable buttons — set it up to meet your individual requirements. Every videographer and photographer has their own way of doing things, and no rigid system will appeal to everyone. That’s why the Octoplus was designed with a one-touch backup that can save up to 10 customizable presets. Set it up according to your specific needs. Before the Octoplus copies hundreds of files, its auto-rename function steps into batch rename every file so that they’re easy to understand and identify. The system includes the options you need to create sensical file names, like sequential numbers, unique names, and more. So instead of having to search through meaningless file names like “C001.MOV,” the Octoplus will rename it to something far more helpful, like “[Date][Project Name][Clip Number].MOV”. With its backlit 2.2” LCD, the Octoplus gives you an effortlessly viable display — even in direct sunlight and total darkness. You’ll never have to squint or make brightness adjustments. The Octoplus doesn’t force you to scroll or navigate through endless menus. Instead, all important information is displayed on the outer ring of the display, with four customizable buttons surrounding it. There’s no need to power down when your battery is low — the Octoplus features a removable, hot-swappable NP F-550 battery designed to be compatible with all your other equipment.
You can transfer up to 4 TB of data on a single charge, and it only takes 45 to fully charge the battery.
Should the battery die on you, the Octoplus will still support the UDF File Management System. This enables it to function like any standard SSD drive would (and with any system).

We're the ORANGEMONKIE team. Thank you for supporting us and continuously giving us ideas to build upon. As many of you know, we’ve successfully launched the Foldio studio series on both Indiegogo and Kickstarter to help you create high-quality product photos and 360-degree content. Now we’re back with something more innovative than ever!  We know that professional and amateur photographers all want to take high-quality photos of their products, but without spending thousands of dollars on equipment. What they need is an all-in-one solution for their 360 product photography needs.So now we've launched our newest Foldio360 project, the Smart Dome. We built a product that offers customizable lighting, no shadow concerns, and less photoshop editing.  We redesigned the traditional square photo studio with two main structures: the dual shell structure and the dome shape structure. Why? Because traditional photo studios are overpriced, time-consuming, and require professional training to use. The newly designed dual shell structure uniquely diffuses the light in the interior, eliminating light reflection in your photos. Additionally, the dome shape design enables precise and uniform lighting.  You don’t need to be a photographer to take a great product shot - you just need the Foldio360 Smart Dome. The Foldio360 Smart Dome is a product photography studio that creates high-quality 360-degree images, videos, and still shot photos. Even if you’ve never taken 360 photoshoots, you can take a beautiful 360 product image.Our project brings photo quality to everyone. Whether you are a corporate designer, handmade designer, or amateur E-Commerce seller, blogger - anyone can add 360 product photos to their page in less than 5 minutes. Not to mention how easy our Smart Dome is to use. Just set your settings and click one button.   Made to adjust to YOUR product and environment  Whether you want to take a product shot of a diamond, candle, or wallet - you can do it all without moving the Foldio360 Smart Dome. Photographers no longer need to move around their equipment after every shot to find the perfect lighting. Simply just adjust the brightness and color temperature with your phone/PC, and switch the front and top covers to take different angles of your product. Functions:
 LED light adjustment - Change the color temperature from 2300K to 5600K   
 Interchangeable magnetic covers - Easily create photos and 360-degree images from different angles  
 Sliding door cover - Preserve light to create the perfect product photo and adjust the door depending on your smartphone. 
 Necklace hanger - Hang your jewelry from the top cover for necklace shots  
 Dome stand - Raise the height of the Foldio360  Smart Dome for wider angle camera shots  
 3/8"" Male thread - Mount your smartphone using a tripod ball head 
  Built for the busy  Traditionally, 360 product photography requires multiple separate purchases: lighting equipment, 360 turntable, lighting box, editing software, and so on. But, our Foldio360 Smart Dome offers all of this in one single product. Functions:
 360 Smart turntable - Built-in mechanical turntable 
 Automatic 360 Shooting - One-touch to automatically shoot, and produce a 360 image 
 Center point indicator - Effortlessly locate the center of the turntable 
 Upload with ease - Share your shots with our App or PC360 Software easily
 Smartphone, PC, DSLR Friendly The Foldio360 Smart Dome works seamlessly with a smartphone, DSLR, or PC. Whether you shoot with your smartphone or DSLR, you can easily connect with the Foldio360 Smart Dome.  Functions:
 Control with PC or Smartphone - Wireless control of lighting and shooting options  
 Automatic 360 shooting - Create 360-degree images and videos with one click
 IR transmitter - Connect with a smartphone or PC to remotely control your camera for automatic photo shots 
 There is nothing out there that can compare The Foldio360 Smart Dome is extremely affordable compared to other professional high-quality solutions. Our team’s biggest challenge was creating a reasonably priced product that offers professional-level quality.  One-stop solution to your product photography  Capture and upload your product photography easily on our App or PC360 Software. All Foldio360 Smart Dome Indiegogo backers will receive a free one-year subscription to the PC360 software.

  GravGrip™ includes a 1 Action Camera and 1 Cell Phone adapter.

Mount your Cell Phone or Action Camera to GravGrip™ with the included adapters. Lock your camera into position by rotating the blue knob.
2 POSITIONS: Mount your camera in the ""ROLL"" position to keep a stable horizon or in the ""TILT"" position to easily capture those epic ultra low and high angle shots. Lock into position by rotating the blue knob.
Rotate weight set upwards to decrease gimbal speed or downwards to increase gimbal speed. Fine tune GravGrip™ to your liking. Twist the weights together to lock into position!
GravGrip's balance correction system is adjusted using hand force. Some camera's have an offset center of Gravity (hint hint: GoPro), easily level the horizon with a quick change in position. This system will NOT budge while in use!
 
 
 
 
 
  

 
Our custom extension pole is no joke! This pole has an unmatched premium feel to it. You will not be disappointed in our combo deal.
 
 
 
Enjoy a small sample of the work dedicated to GravGrip™ over the past few years. I can truthfully say blood, sweat, and tears were put into GravGrip's development.
