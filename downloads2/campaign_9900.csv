<p><a href=""HTTP://www.pprwrk.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PPRWRK</a> is the collaborative efforts of illustrator Mary Margaret LaVoie and photographer David Ruiz of <a href=""http://www.423br.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">423BR.com</a>. We combine our talents as <a href=""http://www.pprwrk.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PPRWRK</a> to make wheat-paste murals, an affordable/removable alternative to paint. Our murals are a practice in impermanence, with a musically based influence, meant to make people smile by being a temporary change of scenery.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need and Why:</span></strong></p>
<p>After 2 years of amazing memories, we're ready to upgrade. Its time to purchase our own <a href=""http://www.oceusa.com/main/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302161307&amp;PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441903600"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Océ PlotWave 300® Large Format Printer</a> to make ourselves more available to the public. As visually explained in the video owning our own printer will not only cut down on production costs, but will cut out almost 40% of our labor hours. Our current method uses 11"" x 17"" sheets of paper that have to be individually hand cut, and then tiled up on the wall. The new method will decrease our cut, install, and removal time drastically just by upgrading to a 36"" wide scroll print.</p>
<p>We are asking for $8000. </p>
<ul>
<li>$6500 - <a href=""http://www.oceusa.com/main/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302161307&amp;PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441903600"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Océ PlotWave 300® Large Format Printer</a>. These funds in addition to the $2500 we received from the 2012 <a href=""http://makework.is/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MakeWork</a> grant add up to the roughly $9000 we need to purchase and ship the new printer to us.</li>
<li>$1500 - Incentive costs such as: T-shirt printing, sticker production, 1 inch button production, hand sewn goods, mural costs (printing, paste, travel to installation) for the assortment of indoor/outdoor mural options, etc.</li>
</ul><p>If additional funds past the $8000 are recieved, we plan to continue building PPRWRK to be a more affordable and repeatable option. Future expenses include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding local mural installs for schools or our community.</li>
<li>A supply of paper and toner for the printer.</li>
<li>Purchasing a second ladder to expedite installs.</li>
<li>Setting aside a bank used solely for design review fees and permit costs.</li>
<li>Building large surface cutting tables to make cutting our artwork a more controllable process.</li>
</ul><h3>What PPRWRK offers the community:</h3>
<p>Our murals are all installed in public places meant to be enjoyed by everybody free of charge. Our murals also allow building/business owners a non-permanent alternative to a painted mural. We've pasted at schools, arts festivals, music festivals, in restaurants, for fun, and any other wall we've been allowed to.</p>

<p>For our first showcase we plan to install up to 20 murals across downtown Chattanooga, from Frazier Avenue to Main Street, using David’s photographs to pay homage to some of Chattanooga’s local musicians. With 13 approved buildings, housing the 20 walls, and a pre-approval from the Chattanooga Sign Commission, this project is only gonna get bigger.</p>
<p>The project will launch with two showcases, the first on March 23rd, the second in June/July. Each showcase will hang for 30 days, then will be removed for 30-90 days in preparation for the next showcase. The second showcase will be of Mary’s illustration work, she plans to adorn the same walls with an imaginative and playful journey through Chattanooga.</p>

<p>At a three week long Pilchuck workshop this July, I will keep an online journal about the adventures, misadventures, fortunes won, loves lost (and all the juicy gossip) so that you will have an intimate understanding of what it is I, and other artists do at these retreats and why it’s so important to go.  Not only will I make this a fun, real-life novella that is written as it is experienced, but you will influence the narrative by giving me brainstorming ideas for artwork.  Since I am going to this workshop to be challenged and grow as an artist, <strong>I will use each of your suggestions like assignments on some secret mission</strong>.  Like a good improv show, I’ll figure out a way to focus on every one of your ideas at some point during the retreat!  Not only will this be a fun and informative blog to follow, but you will take pride when you read the chapter that you helped to create because of the idea you put in my head.  It’s like a ‘Choose your own adventure’ book where each person gets to suggest one chapter and I, the protagonist, will tie it together into a cohesive whole.  You, my supporters, are not just helping me to attend this summer art camp,<strong> you are my fellow collaborators</strong> in a project whose purpose is to develop a visual language we can all understand.  No matter how far flung you may be, everyone can participate in this particular project and together we will make art happen!</p>

<p><strong>What you are for me:</strong></p>
<p>You are my public, my base; you are the folks I want to connect with.  I want to know how you think about art and how I might be able to make artwork that can be understood and appreciated by YOU.  Have you ever had the experience of going to a museum or gallery, wandering around and thinking “Am I the only one here who doesn’t get it?”  I have that feeling often, and it seems like the Art World isn’t concerned so much with whether or not people “get it.”  Personally, I feel it extremely important to be able to communicate my ideas through art in a way that can be understood by as many people as possible.  That’s why I’ve started this project which will involve your thoughts and ideas about what art could be.  <strong>I want to hear your stories</strong> of when you’ve been moved by art, or ideas you’ve always thought would make a cool show, or even your personal philosophy of what you call art and what you don’t.  <strong>With a survey of your opinions I will be able to start developing symbols of universal meaning</strong> that can express our modern day experience through sculpture and installation.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of what I’ve got so far from your suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A theme called Paradox where two opposites show a deep truth of reality.</li>
<li>Visually, something that looks like one thing from far away and another from close up.</li>
<li>Badgers! –why not?</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>What I am for you:</strong></p>
<p>The focus of my work increasingly has to do with communities and the roles we play in society.  By getting you all involved in sending me to Pilchuck <strong>I’m making the class into its own community project</strong>.  I want you to know about, and then to have a part in, what it is I do.  I want you to have good art in your lives and feel proud that you are part of the inspiration for it.  Rather than a solo journey for me to the mountain top, I’m going to bring you along on the journey and share what I learn.  To keep it an interactive process, I will be updating every day and remain available via e-mail for questions and comments.  I want this experience to be an open dialogue with you because the more people who share their opinions the better I’ll be at creating an understandable visual language for my art.  As an added bonus, after such intensive training and inspiration I will be all jazzed up to return to my studio and create new sculptures.  I can’t think of more deserving people to be the recipients of such creative outpouring than those who made it possible.  You are the people I can rely upon for encouragement, honest opinions, and support, and <strong>I want each of you to have something of mine that means something to you</strong>.</p>
<p>So give what you can, if you can.  I appreciate it all, but if you can’t, the most important thing to me is having you aboard.  Anyone can send me an idea and come along with me on this journey!</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p></div>","A ‘Choose your own adventure’ blog starring yours truly.
At a three week long Pilchuck workshop this July, I will keep an online journal about the adventures, misadventures, fortunes won, loves lost (and all the juicy gossip) so that you will have an intimate understanding of what it is I, and other artists do at these retreats and why it’s so important to go.  Not only will I make this a fun, real-life novella that is written as it is experienced, but you will influence the narrative by giving me brainstorming ideas for artwork.  Since I am going to this workshop to be challenged and grow as an artist, I will use each of your suggestions like assignments on some secret mission.  Like a good improv show, I’ll figure out a way to focus on every one of your ideas at some point during the retreat!  Not only will this be a fun and informative blog to follow, but you will take pride when you read the chapter that you helped to create because of the idea you put in my head.  It’s like a ‘Choose your own adventure’ book where each person gets to suggest one chapter and I, the protagonist, will tie it together into a cohesive whole.  You, my supporters, are not just helping me to attend this summer art camp, you are my fellow collaborators in a project whose purpose is to develop a visual language we can all understand.  No matter how far flung you may be, everyone can participate in this particular project and together we will make art happen!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""For me, artistic activity is a spiritual activity that all artists practice.""</i> –<i> Robert Filliou, artist</i></p>
<p>My name is Raghubir and I am a teaching artist and a teaching Kundalini yogi.  </p>
<p>I have a multi-disciplinary practice through which I am always exploring the confluence of artistic and spiritual practices. In all my different kinds of projects (which include studio art and/or social practice, pedagogy, and in yoga classes and workshops)  I emphasize that with yogic technology at its core, creativity and art-making have the potential to transform individual and group consciousness and to ultimately change the world...whether you consider yourself an artist or not.</p>
<p><i>""Creativity is not just for artists. It's for businesspeople looking for a new way to close a sale; it's for engineers trying to solve a problem; it's for parents who want their children to see the world in more than one way."" - Twyla Tharp, dancer and choreographer</i></p>
<p>I've been ""writing"" The Eleven Yogic Arts of Creative Living for many years. It's gone through multiple iterations and it's content has found it's way into the classes and workshops I teach both as an art teacher and a yoga instructor/trainer. Yogic technology informs everything I do both in and out of the art studio.  Since yogic technology is such a valuable tool for transformation and creativity, I feel it is essential to include yogic curriculum in schools, workplaces, and institutions.  This book takes the position that everyone is creative, and that your power, influence, and happiness is ultimately dependent on how you access and manage this natural energy flow.  </p>

For those not familiar with Yogi Bhajan <i>or</i> his teachings,  he arrived in Los Angeles virtually unknown in 1968 and shared the secret teachings of Kundalini Yoga with young spiritual seekers of the era.  He immediately recognized that the experience of higher consciousness they were attempting to find through drugs, could be achieved by practicing the Science of Kundalini Yoga, while simultaneously rebuilding their nervous systems. Breaking the centuries old tradition of secrecy surrounding the empowering science of Kundalini Yoga, he began teaching it publicly. With yogic technology of meditation, physical exercises and postures, yogic philosophy, and loving acceptance, he gave an effective alternative to a self-destructive and non-productive way of life. Inspired and motivated by Yogi Bhajan's words and adhering to the practices he taught, his students got creative! Tons of music, art, poetry and creative businesses flowed forth; reflecting the connection to the Universal flow of consciousness he shared with everyone. In addition to writing and speaking extensively about Creativity, Yogi Bhajan's expertise and influence affected people in all fields and from all walks of life; in the healing arts, the business world, in the arts, religion, government and sports. You could say that he embodied a rare combination of spiritual and down-to-earth practical wisdom which anyone can apply to any aspect of life.  </p>
<p>Although I had been a yoga and meditation practitioner for most of my adult life, when I started practicing these teachings in the mid-2000's, my life <i>seriously</i> transformed for the better. I wasn't planning to teach the stuff, I just wanted to deepen my practice. When I started teaching in order to be of service to others, that's when everything in my life really shifted. Delving into the lectures of Yogi Bhajan, I found tremendous amounts of information about creativity - what it is, how to get it, how to maintain it, and how to share it in such a way that you never are without it.  This found its way into my blogs, newsletters, and classes. As you can imagine, it was suggested to me over and over again that a book was around the corner. That's the story.</p>
<p>If I was going to write a book, I wanted to create a tool that gave people access to their creativity no matter <i>what</i> they did; no matter their creative track record.  I wanted the book to be both useful and empowering. Being an advocate for safe self-expression and creative empowerment, I wanted it to be user-friendly and beneficial for artists, spiritual seekers and practitioners, students, teachers. I envisioned a resource that would give readers a better understanding of HOW creativity works so that they could access, manage and deliver it with impact in any way they chose.  </p>

<b>Who is Máel Dúin?</b><br/>
</h1>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>And what is the sculpture park to be about?</b></p>
<p>Máel Dúin is a Heroic figure in Irish literature who most likely lived around the 5th or 6th century. His father was a king of the Eoghanacht of Munster and his mother was a Nun. The day before Máel Dúin was born his father was murdered by plunderers from an offshore island. Máel Dúin's mother gave up her son to fosterage and in his late teens he finally discovers his true parentage and sets off on a voyage to revenge his father's death. Twenty warriors accompany Máel Dúin on the voyage, but on the first night they are blown off course by a mystical wind into the realms of another world. For several years they seek passage back to Ireland and encounter 33 strange islands upon their voyage. The Irish sculpture park is about recreating the settings of each of the 33 islands and the strange things Máel Dúin and his companions uncover. The story is said to be a subliminal account of Irelands conversion to Christianity, and relates how he sets off on a passage of vengeance but returns with a heart of forgiveness. </p>

The Irish Sculpture Park is about breathing life into an Irish folktale written in the 7th century ""the Voyage of Máel Dúin - the Devotee of God"". The park will comprise of 1,500 sculptures spread over 33 locations. At each location a group of sculptures will depict an episode of the folktale. The sculptures will be placed along a walkway of four-to-five miles in Killarney town. 
THIS fundraising campaign is about SECURING SEED-CAPITAL to design the park and to begin the first phase of development. YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS will guarantee that this venture will become a thriving success and together we can create a piece of HISTORICAL ART that can be APPRECIATED for the next 1,000 YEARS. 
I believe that this sculpture park will be an INSPIRATION in terms of CREATIVITY, and as a walkway it will promote a sense WELL-BEING and OUTDOOR ACTIVITY.
I am hoping that 15,000 people from Ireland, Europe, and the United States will each DONATE € 22 to ensure the fundraising target is 100% fulfilled. 

""The Oak sleeps in the Acorn. The Bird waits in the Egg, and in the highest vision of the Soul, a waking Angel stirs. DREAMS ARE THE SEEDLINGS OF REALITY.

How your Money will be Invested



The launch of the sculpture park and the ILLUSTRATION of DETAILED SKETCHES of the 1,500 SCULPTURES, so people can envisage the full magnitude of the park. 
The SUCCESSFUL CREATION of TEN NEW JOBS within the first year of the project being up and running.

The commission of the first segment of the sculpture park - an impressive ARCHWAY cast in bronze comprising of TWO TOWERING PILLARS, each with THREE EAGLES perched on top - the Gateway to the Voyage. 
The SECUREMENT of Job Creation Grants in Ireland potentially worth € 150,000. 
The DEVELOPMENT of an INTERACTIVE WEBSITE for you to follow the project.

OUR GOAL
Securing SEED-CAPITAL for this project will set the momentum for our campaign, and how we can deliver on timelines with regards the construction of the park


In the first year we hope to raise € 750,000, create 10 new jobs and put in place the entire framework for the project. 
By the end of YEAR TWO, with your help, we will have 20 full-time employees. We will have raised € 2 million in cash, and we'll be in a position to expand in proportion to our fundraising successes.
WE WILL HAVE PUT UP THE FIRST 33 SCULPTURES, one at each of the primary locations along the walkway. People will now be able to appreciate the full magnitude of the venture, and as we enter YEAR THREE we will expand accordingly, enriching each of the locations with additional sculptures.

The good news: our book is already published in Greece by Kastaniotis editions, December 2010.
The better news we hope for: with your help, to publish it internationally!
We started this journey to reveal the social identity of the modern
Muslim society of Western Thrace.
On our own initiative and taking advantage of our being women, we dared to get into a completely sealed world and earn the trust of this minority, in order to
know it better. 
With great patience and persistence and our journalistic experience about the Muslim culture as our great
asset, over two years (2008-2010),
 we were accepted into the homes of the Muslims and became part of their lives.
We lived with them; we shared their troubles and their dreams. We became
familiar with the contradictory reality of three minorities: Pomaks, Turkish,
Roma. But we also discovered one small minority, unknown until then:
the Sudanese, whose ancestors came to Thrace as slaves during the Ottoman
Dominion. 
We photographed the modern Muslim woman in private family moments, the
young people at school and during their free time, the work -a work in decline- in the tobacco
fields. We got permission from the Ministry of Education to enter minority schools. There, we became familiar with the critical problems in education â€“ a source of major problems in this society. We listened
to the Muslim Greek citizens confiding to us the crucial  issues they have to deal with within their
sociopolitical life. 


 Since the mid 1990's we both have been covering stories, for Greek magazines and newspapers, addressing major social problems and situations modern society faces,
both in Greece and abroad. Guided by a shared  sensibility and interest, we have achieved a productive cooperation with social and political content.

The Impact


Through this photographic edition, based on journalistic
research, we aim to present to the rest of the world the unknown world of Greek Thrace
â€“ a beautiful part of Greece that has mostly met with ignorance and indifference.

Besides the sociopolitical problems that Muslims in Thrace face, they have a huge and rich cultural heritage which
needs to be protected and become known more widely,
so it doesn't fade away.
Our goal is that this
book not to be limited within the
Greek borders, but translated and
published internationally.
We have already  contacted with publishers in Europe and Turkey, who
have showed great interest in our book but  the costs for translation and printing need to be covered first.
Universities around the world dealing with minority issues and Islam have also shown great interest in our book.
We have been invited to lecture on it and introduce it to their students -another reason (and audience) for which translation and publication of this work is
needed.


What We Need & What You Get 



We need:  Translation into English and Turkish in a single edition, plus the Printing Costs, amounting to a total of:   24.000$
You can help by donating and get several perks.

<p>Hi.  We're Dave and Marrilee and we are artists who like to create and share interactive art.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Previously, most of our interactive art was temporary in nature, being shared with our community and then let go; up, up in flames.  The art we're now making though centers around a different kind of interactivity: creating platforms that can be shared and re-shared. We want to create a performance stage for the 8th annual Art Outside festival (<a href=""http://www.artoutside.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">http://www.artoutside.org</a>) that professional performers, casual entertainers, and those new to sharing their gifts and finding their voice can enjoy an audience from.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Last year we made the prettiest little stage you could cut your teeth on and this year we want to further honor people's contributions by creating an even more magical space.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To create this large piece, we'll be working very closely with half a dozen skilled apprentices who are interested in learning more about wood-working and glass.  You will be directly contributing to the growth of their craft and experience as artists.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$6,000 covers, material cost, sound and light rental, and transport - in that order of cost.  The materials budget represents the vast majority.  While much of the magic in our former efforts was largely in dressing up simple materials (plywood and 2x4s), with this project we want to invest in maple, cherry and walnut.  We hope to create something that can be cherished and used by our community for years to come.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The sound and light rental portion is also noteworthy as we will be recording the scheduled acts so that they will have these materials for their own promotional purposes.  So, you're not just building a stage, you're helping to potentially further the careers of dozens of other artists too.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Finally, this isn't an operation we can simply throw in the back of our van.  It takes truck rentals and significant logistics planning and dollars.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
Maximum Exposure is a student run Arts Festival that exhibits the work of students from Ryerson University's School of Image Arts. From the beginning of April until the first weekend of May, hundreds of Image Arts students have the opportunity to show their work to the public in professional venues situated in Toronto's Queen West gallery district. Maximum Exposure is open to the public and includes free admission to all exhibitions of photography, interactive new media works, public street art, and film screenings which allows as many people as possible to see the extraordinary work of students.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Maximum Exposure Coordinating Team consists of 4 graduating Photography student from Ryerson, Kyle Brohman, Nicole Kim, Christopher Jacques Lacroix, and Lindsay Voegelin.</div>
<h3>WHAT YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING</h3>
<p>To best show the work of over 200 emerging artists, Maximum Exposure has expanded to 7 exhibitions in 4 venues in the Queen West Gallery district and in other Toronto locations. Your support will go towards venue rentals, promotions, installation, and receptions for the exhibition openings. We do not help fund the production of any student work; we simply create a platform for their work to be shown to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Starting in September, the Maximum Exposure coordinating team began organizing venues, submissions, and multiple fundraising efforts. While we have been successful in securing funding from the University and industry partners, our mandate of keeping the festival free to the public means we still need funds to ensure its success, and the success of future Maximum Exposure Festivals. We are almost there, and with your donation we plan to make this year's festival the best yet!</p>
<p>In return for your generous support, you can receive the following:</p>
<p>- A thank you on our <a href=""http://www.maxex.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Maximum Exposure"">website</a></p>

<p>- Warm and Fuzzy feelings ! (Guaranteed)</p>
<p>- A copy of <a href=""http://www.function.ryerson.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Function"">Function Magazine</a>, the annual Publication by The School of Image Arts</p>
<p>- A limited edition print of the Maximum Exposure Starburst</p>
<p>- A Maximum Exposure Portfolio curated by the Coordinating Team, limited edition of 17</p>
<p>- An invitation to the Industry Preview Reception and a guided tour of the entire festival.</p>

Depending on your level of contribution, we are offering some sweet-ass Pirate Shwag Perks such as: necklaces, stickers, flags, ""pirate booty"", an Antiqued Bronze Apogaea Lapel Pin, and even some very special experiences partying with the pirates at Apo and at our De Camp Russian Party, after we get back from Apo!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p align=""justify"">But that doesn't answer to the question. We are not our names, age our job, we are what moves and what drives us. We are three old friends from Lisbon, Portugal, who want to do something different. We have known each other for more than 25 years now and we share a lot of interests like traveling, capturing moments and emotions on photographs and film, meeting new people and sharing our stories. And with that we want to embark on amazing adventure and create chain of emotions to help others.</p>

<p align=""justify"">To travel around Europe for 100 days in an RV, visiting more than 20 countries with a main goal: find the best street artists of each city we stop by, helping them out by giving some visibility and spread out the word about how amazing they are. <br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The best in each city will receive a prize from our hands! </strong></span></p>

<p align=""justify"">How are we going to pull this off and interact with you and all the people who join us in this adventure? <br/> We will use the social media, of course.

We will upload a video with a small performance and interview of the best 3 artists we select from each city. <strong>Before we continue our journey the artist with more likes from our followers gets the prize and more visibility!</strong> We will repeat this process in checkpoint of our journey, extending our help to more artists and creating cool and artistic content for everybody to listen, see and most of all feel!</p>

<p align=""justify"">We want to get everyone's attention to our social media platforms where everything is going to happen for you to see. The adventure, and the videos, photos and interviews of the best street performers. So here are some simple ideas to achieve our goal:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>We are going to have a customized RV, Id Cards and clothing with our logos and also distribute leaflets to encourage people to see our project, give their contribution if they want or follow us in the adventure;</li>
</ul>
<div align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NzGsZMmSwNU/UPgYZDwsLDI/AAAAAAAAAnA/fLaDpdXtZx8/s550/initiatives.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li style=""padding-top: 5px;"">We will have a giveaway of instant photos to random people in the streets of each city (5000 photos in total) and encourage them to post a photo holding the picture they got from us on our Facebook page. Then all they have to do is get their friends to like the photo. In the end of our journey the photos with the most likes will get gifts too. The photo will be handed with a special frame holder<strong> (click the photos bellow to see a video explaining our idea)</strong>;</li>
</ul>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li style=""padding-top: 5px;"">We are going to promote treasure hunts in each city. How? 100 QR codes will be placed in each city with links to our Facebook page. And here is the twist: one of them will get you to a winner's page.

<li style=""padding-top: 5px;"">In each city we will set up a day, hour and place for everyone to meet us up, take some pictures with us, to be posted on Facebook, and also get some instant photos for free!</li>
<li style=""padding-top: 5px;"">In the end of our trip we will make a draw to give gifts to our followers;</li>

<p align=""justify"">We have contacted Portuguese celebrities to work with us and help us spread out the word and give visibility to our idea. We are proud to say that we already have the full support of <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nuno-Norte/113063994712?sk=app_2405167945"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nuno Norte</a></span></em></strong>, the winner of the Portuguese Idol (1st edition). He has now a solid career in music and guess what (…?) he was a street musician for many years before going to the show. <br/> We also have the support from <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Valete1/app_2405167945"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Valete</a></span></em></strong>, one of the most eloquent and influent Portuguese Rappers, and as Hip Hop has grown to having a steady cultural ground, we wanted to have some representation from that area, getting closer to people. <br/> Additionally, <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/andrenunesactor?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">André Nunes</a></span></em></strong><em>,</em> a well-known actor from Portuguese TV and Stages, mainly know by its great sense of humor and comical roles.<br/> Another one is the comedians/musicians duo <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HOMENSDALUTAOFICIAL/app_2405167945"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Homens da Luta</a></span></em></strong><em>, </em>a great TV phenomenon. They base their act mainly on street sketches getting people off guard, and firmly sustain an image of righteousness and voice to the people. <br/>The role of the sponsors will be simple, but of the utmost importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share and give project visibility through their contacts;</li>
<li>Star on promotional photos and videos to help spread out the word;</li>
<li>Share contacts with us and call other artists to help;</li>
<li>Give simple gifts as autographed Cd's and ticket shows to give our followers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">You can click on each photo and see the great promotional videos with them:</span></strong></p>

<p align=""justify"">Besides the street artists, we also want to give our contribution to a Social Solidarity Institution.  We selected the non-profit organization called ""Moinho da Juventude"" (Youth Mill).</p>

<p>We chose this Organization for two main reasons:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Because they provide an essential care to one of the toughest neighborhoods in Portugal where around 8 thousand people live in, providing day care to all the children and trying to give a purpose in the life of hundreds of youngsters through education, art and culture to give them an opportunity outside of the streets and delinquent life.</li>
<li>Because they are our neighbors and we want to help locally and with impact, trying to improve our community and give something back.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">You can know more about their amazing mission <a href=""http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?client=tmpg&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=pt%7Cen&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.moinhodajuventude.pt/index.php/pt/moinho&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4yOktMqJaZzszFA1-6IO2gezrXw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.<br/> We are going to donate them 10% of the money raised here and we have a place on our Blog and Facebook page where people can make donations. That money will be converted to formation, material and services and the more money we raise here, the more we’ll be able to help them too!</p>

<p align=""justify"">We want to give a small share to our country in this time of crisis. Thus, we have simple ideas so people can know more about our amazing country and its 900 years of history.</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>In the end, our trip will carry with visiting Portuguese cities where we want to show all our followers how amazing they are and how a great place to visit Portugal is;</li>
<li>Show all the great Portuguese gastronomy by selecting the best Portuguese restaurants in the cities we visit and giving them the visibility we can;</li>
<li>Show that Portuguese are great people, with initiative and creativity and that the spirit of adventure didn’t end at the time of the Discoveries;</li>
<li>Help promote some typical Portuguese products around Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if everything goes according to plan you will feel an urge to visit us here in Portugal!</p>

<p align=""justify"">After we receive your help and reach our goal we will need one month to take off, so we are thinking of starting our adventure in April. It’s a great time to go because it’s cheaper than in the summer peak season, there are less tourists and the street artists raise less money. We also believe that in this time of the year we will encounter the true street performers who make a living out of it all year long.</p>

<p>Escolhemos esta organização por duas razões principais:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Pela sua fantástica missão que assegura cuidados essenciais num dos bairros mais problemáticos de Portugal, onde mais de 8 mil pessoas vivem, providenciando infantário para muitas crianças do bairro e dando um propósito de vida a centenas de jovens através da educação, arte e cultura para lhes dar uma oportunidade fora das ruas e de uma vida delinquente.</li>
<li>Por eles serem nossos vizinhos e nos ser uma realidade muito próxima. Queremos assim ajudar localmente e com impacto tentando dar o nosso contributo à nossa comunidade.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">Podes saber mais sobre a sua fantástica missão e história de mais de 25 anos <a href=""http://www.moinhodajuventude.pt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aqui</a>.<br/> Temos uma percentagem de 10% sobre o dinheiro angariado aqui que lhes iremos doar e temos também um local no nosso Blogue e Facebook onde todos lhes podem doar dinheiro, dinheiro esse que converteremos em formação, material e obras e quanto mais angariarmos aqui mais os conseguiremos ajudar!</p>

<p align=""justify"">Depois de recebermos a vossa ajuda iremos precisar aproximadamente de um mês para tratar de tudo antes de iniciarmos esta aventura. Estamos portanto a apontar para Abril que é uma altura excelente pois não é tão cara como a época do Verão e não existindo tantos turistas pela Europa faz com que a nossa ajuda faça mais sentido pois não conseguem angariar tanto dinheiro nesta altura. Assim, pensamos também conseguir encontrar os verdadeiros artistas de rua, que vivem da sua arte o ano inteiro!</p>

1. Who are we?2. Our Project3. How?4. How to attract and interact?5. The Special Appearences6. Social Support & Responsibility7. Portugal8. Goal, Budget & Expenses 9. When?10. Perks11. Thank you all!







- Guilherme, 28 years old, Software Engineer.  - Ivo, 29 years old, Chef.  - João, 28 years old, Product Designer.

But that doesn't answer to the question. We are not our names, age our job, we are what moves and what drives us. We are three old friends from Lisbon, Portugal, who want to do something different. We have known each other for more than 25 years now and we share a lot of interests like traveling, capturing moments and emotions on photographs and film, meeting new people and sharing our stories. And with that we want to embark on amazing adventure and create chain of emotions to help others.

To travel around Europe for 100 days in an RV, visiting more than 20 countries with a main goal: find the best street artists of each city we stop by, helping them out by giving some visibility and spread out the word about how amazing they are. The best in each city will receive a prize from our hands! 

This is our project! This is Hello Europe! Everything starts with hello, and we want that word to be a metaphor of the moments we experience and the word we say the most, every day, to all the people we meet!


How are we going to pull this off and interact with you and all the people who join us in this adventure?  We will use the social media, of course. We have a Facebook page integrated with Twitter, Blogger and a YouTube channel. You won’t be a mere spectator! You will interact!
And how's that?

You will choose the best buskers. We will upload a video with a small performance and interview of the best 3 artists we select from each city. Before we continue our journey the artist with more likes from our followers gets the prize and more visibility! We will repeat this process in checkpoint of our journey, extending our help to more artists and creating cool and artistic content for everybody to listen, see and most of all feel!

We want to get everyone's attention to our social media platforms where everything is going to happen for you to see. The adventure, and the videos, photos and interviews of the best street performers. So here are some simple ideas to achieve our goal:

We are going to have a customized RV, Id Cards and clothing with our logos and also distribute leaflets to encourage people to see our project, give their contribution if they want or follow us in the adventure;



We will have a giveaway of instant photos to random people in the streets of each city (5000 photos in total) and encourage them to post a photo holding the picture they got from us on our Facebook page. Then all they have to do is get their friends to like the photo. In the end of our journey the photos with the most likes will get gifts too. The photo will be handed with a special frame holder (click the photos bellow to see a video explaining our idea);



We are going to promote treasure hunts in each city. How? 100 QR codes will be placed in each city with links to our Facebook page. And here is the twist: one of them will get you to a winner's page. The first person to get there will win the prize (click here to see a video explaining our idea);
In each city we will set up a day, hour and place for everyone to meet us up, take some pictures with us, to be posted on Facebook, and also get some instant photos for free!
In the end of our trip we will make a draw to give gifts to our followers;

You can click on each photo to see images and videos about the initiatives!


We have contacted Portuguese celebrities to work with us and help us spread out the word and give visibility to our idea. We are proud to say that we already have the full support of Nuno Norte, the winner of the Portuguese Idol (1st edition). He has now a solid career in music and guess what (…?) he was a street musician for many years before going to the show.  We also have the support from Valete, one of the most eloquent and influent Portuguese Rappers, and as Hip Hop has grown to having a steady cultural ground, we wanted to have some representation from that area, getting closer to people.  Additionally, André Nunes, a well-known actor from Portuguese TV and Stages, mainly know by its great sense of humor and comical roles. Another one is the comedians/musicians duo Homens da Luta, a great TV phenomenon. They base their act mainly on street sketches getting people off guard, and firmly sustain an image of righteousness and voice to the people. The role of the sponsors will be simple, but of the utmost importance:

Share and give project visibility through their contacts;
Star on promotional photos and videos to help spread out the word;
Share contacts with us and call other artists to help;
Give simple gifts as autographed Cd's and ticket shows to give our followers.

You can click on each photo and see the great promotional videos with them:

We will update this section and post photos and videos as we gather the support of more artists too!

Besides the street artists, we also want to give our contribution to a Social Solidarity Institution.  We selected the non-profit organization called ""Moinho da Juventude"" (Youth Mill).

We chose this Organization for two main reasons:

Because they provide an essential care to one of the toughest neighborhoods in Portugal where around 8 thousand people live in, providing day care to all the children and trying to give a purpose in the life of hundreds of youngsters through education, art and culture to give them an opportunity outside of the streets and delinquent life.
Because they are our neighbors and we want to help locally and with impact, trying to improve our community and give something back.

You can know more about their amazing mission here. We are going to donate them 10% of the money raised here and we have a place on our Blog and Facebook page where people can make donations. That money will be converted to formation, material and services and the more money we raise here, the more we’ll be able to help them too!

We want to give a small share to our country in this time of crisis. Thus, we have simple ideas so people can know more about our amazing country and its 900 years of history.


In the end, our trip will carry with visiting Portuguese cities where we want to show all our followers how amazing they are and how a great place to visit Portugal is;
Show all the great Portuguese gastronomy by selecting the best Portuguese restaurants in the cities we visit and giving them the visibility we can;
Show that Portuguese are great people, with initiative and creativity and that the spirit of adventure didn’t end at the time of the Discoveries;
Help promote some typical Portuguese products around Europe.

And if everything goes according to plan you will feel an urge to visit us here in Portugal!

For all this to happen we need your contribution, and because we don't like to ask for things without giving anything in return, in addition to our gratitude we set some cool perks for you which you can check out here on the right side of your screen! --->As you can see in each Perk tier you get all the Perks from the previous tiers!
With the perk ""Dress me up!"" you win the Hello Europe Super Special T-shirt and here you can see some examples of the designs and colors you can choose from:


When you receive the T-Shirt don't forget to send us a picture of you wearing it so we can post it on our Facebook Hall of Fame so everybody can see you are made this project possible! Show all your friends and get them to like your photo so you can be eligible to other cool gifts in the end of our journey!
With the perk ""Condecorate me!"" you'll be condecorated by your help with a great Hello Europe Badge. You can pick the color and design. See some examples:

With the perk ""Photo Giveaway!"" besides the access to the best photos in HD + Photoshop treatment royalty free for you to use, you also receive at your mail an instant photo of us with a very special frame and a personalized thank you note.

With this perk you also can be eligible for another gift and all you need to do is take a picture of yourself holding the perk you received and sent it to us or post it on our Facebook page. Then get your friends to like it and 1 like = 1 vote. In the end of the adventure, prizes for the most liked photos!
Depending on the perk the expected date of delivery to you is the following:

If you live elsewhere in Europe and really want this perk contact us and convince us that your city would be amazing for this project and we will change or route!
So don't miss out this opportunity to make part of our project, earning our eternal gratitude plus a cool and unique perk for you!

To make this happen, with all that comes with it, we need money. The goal we set is the minimum to make this project happens with all that comes to it.  Here you can see the estimation of the expenses we need to cover:





Item




Description




Value




RV rental
Average 120€ per day in the planned dates
12.000€


Fuel, tolls and ferries
15.000 km!
3.900€


Camping sites and food
We need to sleep and eat
7.100€


Multimedia material
2 instant cameras and 5000 photo paper units
2.500€


Merchandising
RV decoration, clothing, 5000 photo frame holders, 2200 QR code stickers.
1.500€


Artists prizes
250€ for each artist, one per city.
5.500€


Perks (estimation)
T-Shirts, Instant Photos, Photo Frames, Badges and posting expenses
4.000€


Others
Internet, gas cylinders, insurances
1.900€



 


TOTAL


38.400€




On top of this value we want to start with a 10% contribution to the non-profit organization ""Moinho da Juventude"" and considering the IndieGoGo fee of 4% and 3% for credit card processing applied to our total, we are setting our goal to 45.000€.
It’s quite a lot but you all your help we are confident we can achieve it!
We are also trying to contact some brands to see if we can get any sponsors that help us with money or goods. So even if we don’t reach our goal here in Indiegogo we assure you that you will get all your Perks! With the extra money that surpasses our goal we will be able to increase the street artist prizes and donate more money to the selected non-profit organization.So don’t hesitate to give your contribution even if we had already reached our goal!

After we receive your help and reach our goal we will need one month to take off, so we are thinking of starting our adventure in April. It’s a great time to go because it’s cheaper than in the summer peak season, there are less tourists and the street artists raise less money. We also believe that in this time of the year we will encounter the true street performers who make a living out of it all year long.
Thank you in advance for all the help you can give to launch this idea. If you can’t contribute with money, please spread out the word to all of your friends and share this on Facebook. It will be a great help for us! Best regards and hope you like our project and help us have the trip of our lives while helping others and promoting art and culture around Europe.
Thank you!

- Guilherme, 28 anos, Engenheiro Informático. - Ivo, 29 anos, Chef. - João, 28 anos, Designer de Produto.

Isto não responde à pergunta. Isto são os nossos nomes, a nossa profissão e a nossa idade. Não define quem somos. O que define quem somos são os nossos valores, a nossa visão e a nossa missão. Somos de Lisboa, Portugal, e conhecemo-nos há mais de 25 anos e temos muitos interesses em comum tais como viajar, capturar momentos e emoções em fotografia e filme, conhecer novas pessoas e partilhar as nossas histórias. E com esses interesses queremos embarcar numa aventura fantástica onde pretendemos criar uma cadeia de emoções e ajudar outros.
Viajar pela Europa durante 100 dias numa autocaravana, por mais de 20 países com um objectivo principal: encontrar os melhores artistas de rua de cada cidade que visitarmos. Ajudá-los, dando-lhes visibilidade e exposição para divulgar a sua fantástica arte.O melhor de cada cidade receberá um prémio das nossas mãos!

Este é o nosso projecto! Este é o Hello Europe! Tudo começa com um olá, queremos que essa palavra seja metafórica a todos os momentos que experienciarmos e a palavra que vamos dizer mais vezes todos os dias a todas as pessoas que conhecermos e partilharmos a nossa história.

Como é que isto vai funcionar e como vamos interagir contigo e com todos os que nos acompanharem nesta aventura? Vamos utilizar as redes sociais, claro! Temos uma página de Facebook, integrada com Twitter, Blogger e canal de Youtube e tu não serás um mero espectador. Vais interagir!
Com dúvidas ainda? Continua a ler...

Vais escolher os melhores artistas de rua! Vamos colocar um vídeo com uma pequena actuação e entrevista dos 3 melhores artistas de rua que encontrarmos em cada cidade. A antes de seguirmos viagem o artista com mais likes dos nossos seguidores receberá um prémio e mais visibilidade!Vamos repetir este processo para todas as cidades visitadas, estendendo assim o nosso contributo a mais artistas, criando conteúdo fantástico e artístico para que todos possam ver, ouvir e principalmente sentir!
Queremos atrair todas as pessoas que conseguirmos para as nossas plataformas de Social Media onde vamos colocar toda a nossa aventura, os vídeos, fotos e entrevistas dos melhores artistas de rua. Podes ver aqui algumas das iniciativas que temos pensadas para atrair o máximo de visibilidade e de interacção com todos:

Vamos ter uma caravana personalizada e andar identificados com cartões e roupa com os nossos logos e também vamos distribuir flyers para encorajar as pessoas a verem o nosso projecto, darem a sua contribuição se quiserem ou apenas colocarem seguirem-nos nesta aventura;



Vamos oferecer fotografias instantâneas a pessoas aleatórias nas ruas de cada cidade (5000 no total) e vamos encorajá-las a colocarem uma foto delas com a que receberam de nós na nossa página do Facebook. Depois poderão incentivar os amigos a colocarem um like nessa foto e na nossa página também. No fim as fotos com mais likes receberão também prémios. A foto será entregue numa moldura bem especial! (Clica na foto para veres um vídeo que exemplifica o processo);



Vamos promover uma caça ao tesouro em cada cidade. Como? Vamos colocar 100 QR codes por cidade que reencaminham para a nossa página de Facebook. E aqui há uma surpresa: um desses códigos levará para uma página especial premiada. A primeira pessoa a descobrir ganhará um prémio! (clica aqui para veres um vídeo onde explicamos melhor a nossa ideia);
Vamos querer que participem pessoalmente e se encontrem connosco. Em cada cidade vamos marcar um dia, hora e local onde toda a gente pode aparecer, tirar algumas fotos connosco para aparecerem no Facebook e ainda receber algumas fotos instantâneas como oferta!
No fim da nossa viagem vamos fazer um sorteio de um presente entre todos os nossos seguidores.

Clica em cada uma das fotos para saberes mais sobre cada uma das iniciativas!

Queremos que pessoas do mundo do espectáculo apadrinhem a nossa ideia e nos ajudem a divulgar o nosso projecto. Temos orgulho em ter já um padrinho e total apoio do Nuno Norte, vencedor da primeira edição do Ídolos em 2004. Agora com uma carreira sólida na música foi em tempos músico de rua antes de se dar a conhecer no concurso.  Contamos também com o apoio do Valete, um dos mais influentes rappers portugueses e sendo que o Hip Hop nasce nas ruas fez todo o sentido para nós termos um representante dessa área. Outro dos padrinhos é o André Nunes, uma cara bem conhecida da nossa TV e teatro principalmente pelo seu bom sentido de humor e papéis cómicos! Contamos também com o apoio dos ""Homens da Luta"" que nos vão ajudar a dar também visibilidade para irmos fazer a luta por essa Europa fora! O papel de quem nos apadrinha será simples mas de grande importância:

Partilhar e divulgar o projecto através dos seus contactos;
Participar em fotos e vídeos promocionais para ajudar a espalhar a notícia;
Partilhar contactos connosco e chamar outros artistas para participarem;
Oferecer presentes simples tais como cds autografados e bilhetes para espectáculos para podermos sortear pelos nossos seguidores.

Clica em cada uma das fotos em baixo para veres os vídeos que fizemos com eles!

Vamos actualizando esta secção e colocando fotos e vídeos à medida que formos conseguindo mais padrinhos e madrinhas para o nosso projecto!

Para além dos artistas de rua, queremos dar o nosso contributo a uma Instituição de Solidariedade Social. Seleccionamos a organização sem fins lucrativos ""Moinho da Juventude"".

Escolhemos esta organização por duas razões principais:

Pela sua fantástica missão que assegura cuidados essenciais num dos bairros mais problemáticos de Portugal, onde mais de 8 mil pessoas vivem, providenciando infantário para muitas crianças do bairro e dando um propósito de vida a centenas de jovens através da educação, arte e cultura para lhes dar uma oportunidade fora das ruas e de uma vida delinquente.
Por eles serem nossos vizinhos e nos ser uma realidade muito próxima. Queremos assim ajudar localmente e com impacto tentando dar o nosso contributo à nossa comunidade.

Podes saber mais sobre a sua fantástica missão e história de mais de 25 anos aqui. Temos uma percentagem de 10% sobre o dinheiro angariado aqui que lhes iremos doar e temos também um local no nosso Blogue e Facebook onde todos lhes podem doar dinheiro, dinheiro esse que converteremos em formação, material e obras e quanto mais angariarmos aqui mais os conseguiremos ajudar!
Queremos fazer a nossa parte pelo nosso país neste tempo de crise. Para isso temos ideias simples para que as pessoas fiquem a conhecer o nosso fantástico cantinho da Europa e os seus 900 anos de história:


No fim da nossa viagem vamos visitar cidades portuguesas para mostrar a todos os seguidores que fomos angariando o quão fantástico é o nosso Portugal;
Mostrar a nossa fantástica gastronomia descobrindo os melhores restaurantes Portugueses pela Europa e dando-lhes a visibilidade merecida;
Mostrar que os portugueses são pessoas fantásticas, com iniciativa e criatividade e que o espírito de aventura não acabou na época dos Descobrimentos;
Ajudar a divulgar produtos típicos portugueses lá fora.

E se tudo correr como planeado no fim vais ver o teu amor por Portugal reforçado!
Para tudo isto ser possível precisamos do teu contributo! E como não gostamos de pedir sem dar nada em troca, para além da nossa gratidão e de fazeres parte de um projecto diferente, temos prendas para ti que podes ver aqui no lado direito do teu ecrã! --->Como podes ver em cada nível estás adquirir todas as prendas dos níveis anteriores!
Na prenda ""Dress me up!"" recebes a T-Shirt Super Impecável Hello Europe com todas as cores e desenhos que temos à tua escolha:


Quando receberes a T-Shirt não te esqueças de nos enviar uma fotografia tua com ela vestida para a podermos colocar no nosso Quadro de Honra no Facebook para que todos possam ver que tornaste este projecto possível! Mostra a todos os teus amigos e diz-lhes para gostarem da tua foto e ficas assim habilitado a mais prémios fantásticos no fim da nossa aventura!
Com a prenda ""Condecorate me!"" serás condecorado pela tua ajuda com um fantástico crachá. Podes escolher a cor e o desenho que gostas mais. Vê aqui alguns exemplos:

Com a prenda ""See All!"" recebes no teu correio uma foto instantânea nossa com uma moldura especial e um agradecimento personalizado.

Com esta prenda podes ainda habilitar-te a mais prémios, para isso basta tirares uma fotografia tua em que mostras a prenda que recebeste e envia-nos ou coloca no nosso mural do Facebook. Chama os teus amigos para gostarem da foto e 1 like = 1 voto. No fim da nossa viagem as fotos mais votadas terão prémios!
Dependendo da prenda que escolheste a data prevista para entrega é a seguinte:

Adicionando ao nosso total uma percentagem de 10% inicial para o ""Moinho da Juventude"" e considerando a comissão do IndieGoGo de 4% e taxa de transferência de 3% chegamos ao valor de 45.000€ que estamos a pedir!
É upa upa puxadote, mas com a tua ajuda estamos confiantes que vamos conseguir!
Estamos também a tentar contactar algumas marcas para obter algum tipo de patrocínio, quer monetário ou de material. Por isso, mesmo que não atinjamos o nosso objectivo aqui no Indiegogo garantimos que todas as tuas prendas estão asseguradas caso levantemos o dinheiro aqui recolhido! Com o dinheiro extra que ultrapasse o nosso objectivo vamos aumentar os prémios para os artistas de rua e conseguir doar mais dinheiro à Instituição de Solidariedade Social que seleccionámos. Por isso, não hesites em contribuir mesmo já tendo alcançado o nosso objectivo!

Depois de recebermos a vossa ajuda iremos precisar aproximadamente de um mês para tratar de tudo antes de iniciarmos esta aventura. Estamos portanto a apontar para Abril que é uma altura excelente pois não é tão cara como a época do Verão e não existindo tantos turistas pela Europa faz com que a nossa ajuda faça mais sentido pois não conseguem angariar tanto dinheiro nesta altura. Assim, pensamos também conseguir encontrar os verdadeiros artistas de rua, que vivem da sua arte o ano inteiro!

Obrigado a todos desde já por toda a ajuda que puderem dar para iniciar esta aventura. Quem não poder contribuir com dinheiro pedimos que divulguem o projecto a todos os vossos amigos epartilhem no vosso Facebook, já será uma grande ajuda para nós! Com os melhores cumprimentos para todos e esperemos que tenham gostado e entusiasmados com o nosso projecto e que nos ajudem a ter a viagem das nossas vidas enquanto ajudamos outros e promovemos arte e cultura por toda a Europa.
Obrigado!

<p>

Art Metropole is a non-profit organization founded
by artist collective General Idea in 1974. It fosters and facilitates
dynamic structures of artist-initiated publication in any media, especially
innovative formats predisposed to sharing and circulation. </p>

<p><b>The Space</b></p>

AM opened its new shop locale at 1490 Dundas
Street West, in downtown Toronto, on 01 August 2012. After 25 years in a hidden
walk-up location, the new storefront is accessible, allows for chance
encounters and is situated in a neighbourhood where many of the artists that AM
collaborates with or represents are based. In the short time that we have been
open, we have had a noticeable increase in attendance at events and exhibition
projects. While the shop is a spot for the circulation of information and
materials, AM also works from the specifications of the actual space to refine
the mechanisms of the shop.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/41376/files/20130829141959-1.jpg?1377811199"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>The Window</b></p>

For the transformation of the new street front
location, a special emphasis has been put on the window area. Consisting of
large storefront windows, a stage-display-seating-podium and two walls, this
space can accommodate a multiplicity of projects and events by local and
international contributors.  <br/><br/>Our Indiegogo page is dedicated to support these Window Projects, which alternate monthly. <br/><br/>Your pledge will help us pay for the material and production costs of this window exhibition series as well as paying the contributors for their hard work and dedication. With your help, Art Metropole will be able to continue to make its window a unique and accessible space for the production and dissemination of art through new forms of display: Here on the street, in this moment, towards the future!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/41378/files/20130829142051-3.jpg?1377811251"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Moving in, May 2012</span></p>

<p>How do we, urban animals of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, relate to other animals? Whatever the relationship, the dominant idea is that man is a superior species. However, increasingly it appears that we have abused our position as ‘top species’. What can we learn if we really try to listen to, collaborate with or put ourselves in the animals’ place?

<p>The project comprises many approaches to the topic of animals, but also to the medium of photography itself. In my research I document and collect material about animals being humanized by different societies around the world. The final work will take the form of installation and publication – offering the many possible faces and roles embedded within the image material. Another aspect of this process involves virtually sending images taken or chosen for the project to my little niece Chuanita when I am not able to communicate with people. It is some kind of non-verbal answer to her questions: why do I have to travel? What am I searching for?</p>
<p>I find this combination of approaches very inspiring and surprising, due to the huge gap between nature and subsequent documentation of it. In essence, it speaks to the idea that the reality of the world around us is never a given, it is something we have to create.</p>

goal of this campaign is to raise enough money for the materials and 
accoutrements that I need to participate a craft show this holiday season and to sell my 
work wholesale.  If this campaign is successful, I will have everything I
 need to reach a bigger audience.<br/><br/>In order to do this, I need:<br/><br/><b>polymer clay and 
supplies</b> (findings such as metal chains, wires, magnets, barrette bases,

Today I was contacted about participating in the Grand Marché de Noel de Créateurs!   I really want to do it and the booth fee is a little more than I anticipated, (220€) so I'm hoping that with the time left on this campaign I can exceed my goal.  (We can't revise our goal once we launch the campaign).  Thanks so much to everyone and I hope that you all enjoy your Polyflavour perks !!!In 2011 I started making jewelry inspired by old cartoons and comics from the 1920s, 30s and 40s.  There's so much about the drawings from that time that fascinates me.  I love making things inspired by those images that people can wear and display and share.  I'm especially interested in off-model merchandise from this time and I consider what I make to be in the off-model spirit.  I want people to know the source of my inspiration and to look it and and enjoy it and learn more about it and hopefully share my fascination.  I want people to love their Polyflavour wares forever.The 
goal of this campaign is to raise enough money for the materials and 
accoutrements that I need to participate a craft show this holiday season and to sell my 
work wholesale.  If this campaign is successful, I will have everything I
 need to reach a bigger audience.In order to do this, I need:polymer clay and 
supplies (findings such as metal chains, wires, magnets, barrette bases,
 bracelet bases, ring bases, button bases, etc.) to create stock for 
each design that I will include in a line sheet for retailers.
a dremel and bits for bowls  I currently sand all of my 
pieces by hand which can take several hours for bracelets and several 
days for a large bowl or box; and I know that a machine would speed up 
the production of my work a great deal.

<span class=""agText""><h3>Al Davison: a.k.a The Astral Gypsy<br/>
</h3>One morning in 1988 I woke up to find I'd gone blind. At the time I
 had no idea that it was temporary. I just knew that along with the 
blindness I was losing my visual memory, the ability to visualize my 
family's faces, even simple shapes, and that the partial paralysis I'd 
had as a result of being born with Spina-Bifida had returned.<br/>I was 
blind for three months on two occasions that year. My reaction to my 
visual memory fading was to continue to draw, even though I had no idea 
if the pen contained ink or whether the paper was blank or not. When my 
sight returned I began to analyze the drawings I'd produced, and what 
I'd leaned about tapping into the unconscious, perception, dreams, and 
drawing. I have been teaching art based on that knowledge for over 
twenty years.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></span><span class=""agText""></span>
</h3></div><div>
<br/><p><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<h3>The book, the workshop and the Exhibition<br/>
</h3>Now seems like a good time to put all this on paper. But a typical 
'how to draw' book doesn't seem appropriate, given the subject. The process of creating the book should embody the techniques I've developed. So what we have now is part autobiography part 'how to draw'
 and part dream showcase. I've taught everyone from school children to 
senior art students, from dream researchers to teenagers at risk and 
abuse survivors. I plan to launch the book with an exhibition and a workshop. I hope it will become a tool that 
others can also use to develop alternate approaches to the nurturing of 
creativity.<p></p>
</div><div>
<br/><h3>The art of the book and how you can help<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are committed to the idea of the book as an art object in itself, 
as well as the book as a medium for reaching as many people as possible,
 our project combines both. We want to produce a limited edition 
collectors item. 200 hardback copies with a quarter cloth spine, cover 
litho printed with vegetable oil based ink, interiors printed in high 
quality digital, in a an outsized format 31cm x 22cm printed by <a href=""http://www.calverts.coop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Calverts"">Calverts</a>
 containing an original black and white drawing in each copy and priced 
at $49.00 All the proceeds of the limited edition will then used to 
print an affordable trade paperback edition. Our Indigogo campaign last year raised $3,096.00 We still need a further $3500.00. We aim to 
launch the limited edition at<a href=""http://kapowcomicconvention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""""> Kapow</a> in May.<br/></p>
<p>So what happens if we don't meet the target? well, if the money 
raised isn't enough to create the deluxe edition but is enough to 
produce the trade paperback then we will do that, and contributors will 
receive a copy of that plus artwork to the value of their contribution. 
If we fail to raise enough for even the trade edition, the money will go
 into a pot until we can explore other funding opportunities. 
Contributors will receive artwork to the value of their contribution 
anything from a pencil sketch to a archival art print to a full color 
acrylic painting. Should we reach our goal, and have money left over 
after printing the trade edition, <span class=""agText"">that money will go towards equipment to help run art courses for young people in Coventry.</span></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially you can still help, if 
this project captures your imagination then put the word out, tell your 
friends send links to the campaign out with all your e-mails, it all 
helps. Thank you.</p>

<h3><strong>Court résumé</strong></h3>
<p>Aidez-nous à la fabrication de la monnaie et des timbres-poste de la République acadienne. Une œuvre conceptuelle de l'artiste Mario Doucette. </p>
<h3><strong>Histoire</strong></h3>
<p>Le roi français Louix XV décide d’envoyer une puissante escadre pour reprendre l’Acadie. En 1746, cette grande expédition est confiée au duc d’Anville qui se voit charger 76 navires et environ 13 000 soldats. L’expédition fut la plus grande force navale jamais regroupée vers l’Amérique du Nord avant la Révolution américaine. L’effort pour reprendre l’Acadie fut aussi supporté par l’expédition de Ramezay partie de Québec.</p>
<p>L’expédition fut un échec total. À son arrivée à Chibouctou (port de Halifax), la flotte d’Anville ne compte plus que 3 navires de guerre et quelques transporteurs, les autres navires ayant mis en déroute ou coulé en raison de tempêtes violentes. Beaucoup d’hommes ont péri principalement à cause de manque de vivres, de la dysenterie et du scorbut. Le reste de l’équipage campe sur la plage où plusieurs succombent encore à la maladie. Plus de la moitié des hommes de la flotte étaient morts ou sérieusement malades lorsque le duc d’Anville meurt à son tour par une crise d’apoplexie.</p>
<p>Cette lourde perte a rétabli la position de l’Angleterre en Amérique. Elle a aussi annoncé la chute progressive des intervention militaires françaises. L’Acadie mourut sans espoir.</p>
<p>Ce projet, la République acadienne, propose une version alternative de cette histoire. Nous sommes dans un monde parallèle où le duc d’Anville débarque à Chibouctou avec sa flotte et son équipage intactes. Ses victoires en Acadie mettent fin à la guerre avec l’Angleterre. L’Acadie péninsulaire est de nouveau cédée à la France.</p>
<p>Lors de la Convention nationale de 1881 à Memramcook, le quart des 5 000 délégués votent pour le choix du maintient du statut français alors que les autres votent massivement pour la souveraineté. La France accorde l’indépendance à son ancienne colonie, le 15 août 1882.</p>
<p>La République acadienne possède son drapeau, sa citoyenneté, sa <strong>monnaie</strong>, ses <strong>timbres-poste </strong>et sa représentation à l’étranger.</p>

<p>La version la plus courante de la pièce montre la devise et l'insigne de la République acadienne au revers et son ancien président Louis J. Robichaud à l'avers. La représentation du 25e président Louis J. Robichaud sur les pièces de 1 piastre donne à la devise son nom populaire, le « p'tit Louis ».</p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Help us make the coins and postage stamps for the République acadienne. This is a conceptual work by artist Mario Doucette.</p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p>French King Louix XV decided to send a powerful squadron to retake Acadie. In 1746, this great expedition was under the command of the Duc d’Anville, who was entrusted with 76 ships and about 13,000 soldiers. The expedition was the largest naval force ever assembled to North America before the American Revolution. The effort to retake Acadie was also supported by Ramezay's expedition from Quebec.</p>
<p>The expedition was a complete failure. When d’Anville arrived in Chibouctou (Halifax Harbour), the fleet included only 3 war ships and a few transports; the rest had been scattered or sunk due to severe storms. Many men perished, mainly of food shortages, typhus, dysentery, and scurvy. The remaining crews camped on the beach where many continued to succumb to illness. More than half of the men in the fleet were dead or seriously ill when the Duc d’Anville himself died from a stroke.</p>
<p>This heavy loss restored England's position in North America. It also announced the gradual decline of French military intervention. Acadie was lost forever.</p>
<p>This project, la République acadienne, offers an alternative version of this story. We are in a parallel universe where the Duc d’Anville lands in Chibouctou with his fleet and crew intact. His victories in Acadie ended the war with England. The Peninsular Acadie was again ceded to France.</p>
<p>At the 1881 National Convention in Memramcook, a quarter of the 5,000 delegates voted to remain an overseas territory of France while the others voted overwhelmingly for sovereignty. France granted independence to its former colony on August 15, 1882.</p>
<p>La République acadienne has its flag, citizenship, <strong>currency</strong>, <strong>postage stamps </strong>and representation abroad.</p>

Court résumé
Aidez-nous à la fabrication de la monnaie et des timbres-poste de la République acadienne. Une œuvre conceptuelle de l'artiste Mario Doucette. 
Histoire
Le roi français Louix XV décide d’envoyer une puissante escadre pour reprendre l’Acadie. En 1746, cette grande expédition est confiée au duc d’Anville qui se voit charger 76 navires et environ 13 000 soldats. L’expédition fut la plus grande force navale jamais regroupée vers l’Amérique du Nord avant la Révolution américaine. L’effort pour reprendre l’Acadie fut aussi supporté par l’expédition de Ramezay partie de Québec.
L’expédition fut un échec total. À son arrivée à Chibouctou (port de Halifax), la flotte d’Anville ne compte plus que 3 navires de guerre et quelques transporteurs, les autres navires ayant mis en déroute ou coulé en raison de tempêtes violentes. Beaucoup d’hommes ont péri principalement à cause de manque de vivres, de la dysenterie et du scorbut. Le reste de l’équipage campe sur la plage où plusieurs succombent encore à la maladie. Plus de la moitié des hommes de la flotte étaient morts ou sérieusement malades lorsque le duc d’Anville meurt à son tour par une crise d’apoplexie.
Cette lourde perte a rétabli la position de l’Angleterre en Amérique. Elle a aussi annoncé la chute progressive des intervention militaires françaises. L’Acadie mourut sans espoir.
Ce projet, la République acadienne, propose une version alternative de cette histoire. Nous sommes dans un monde parallèle où le duc d’Anville débarque à Chibouctou avec sa flotte et son équipage intactes. Ses victoires en Acadie mettent fin à la guerre avec l’Angleterre. L’Acadie péninsulaire est de nouveau cédée à la France.
Lors de la Convention nationale de 1881 à Memramcook, le quart des 5 000 délégués votent pour le choix du maintient du statut français alors que les autres votent massivement pour la souveraineté. La France accorde l’indépendance à son ancienne colonie, le 15 août 1882.
La République acadienne possède son drapeau, sa citoyenneté, sa monnaie, ses timbres-poste et sa représentation à l’étranger.
 
Niveau Touriste
La monnaie
La piastre est la monnaie officielle de la République acadienne.
La pièce de monnaie de 1 piastre est circulaire avec un diamètre de 26mm et une épaisseur de 2mm. La pièce est faite de bronze. 
La version la plus courante de la pièce montre la devise et l'insigne de la République acadienne au revers et son ancien président Louis J. Robichaud à l'avers. La représentation du 25e président Louis J. Robichaud sur les pièces de 1 piastre donne à la devise son nom populaire, le « p'tit Louis ».

Short Summary
Help us make the coins and postage stamps for the République acadienne. This is a conceptual work by artist Mario Doucette.
History
French King Louix XV decided to send a powerful squadron to retake Acadie. In 1746, this great expedition was under the command of the Duc d’Anville, who was entrusted with 76 ships and about 13,000 soldiers. The expedition was the largest naval force ever assembled to North America before the American Revolution. The effort to retake Acadie was also supported by Ramezay's expedition from Quebec.
The expedition was a complete failure. When d’Anville arrived in Chibouctou (Halifax Harbour), the fleet included only 3 war ships and a few transports; the rest had been scattered or sunk due to severe storms. Many men perished, mainly of food shortages, typhus, dysentery, and scurvy. The remaining crews camped on the beach where many continued to succumb to illness. More than half of the men in the fleet were dead or seriously ill when the Duc d’Anville himself died from a stroke.
This heavy loss restored England's position in North America. It also announced the gradual decline of French military intervention. Acadie was lost forever.
This project, la République acadienne, offers an alternative version of this story. We are in a parallel universe where the Duc d’Anville lands in Chibouctou with his fleet and crew intact. His victories in Acadie ended the war with England. The Peninsular Acadie was again ceded to France.
At the 1881 National Convention in Memramcook, a quarter of the 5,000 delegates voted to remain an overseas territory of France while the others voted overwhelmingly for sovereignty. France granted independence to its former colony on August 15, 1882.
La République acadienne has its flag, citizenship, currency, postage stamps and representation abroad.
 
Level Touriste
The Money
The piastre is the official currency of the République acadienne.
The 1 piastre coin is circular with a diameter of 26mm, and a thickness of 2mm. The coin is made of bronze. 
The current version of the piastre shows the motto and insignia of the République acadienne on the reverse and its former president Louis J. Robichaud on the obverse. The representation of the 25th President Louis J. Robichaud on the 1 piastre coins gives the motto its popular name, the ""p’tit Louis"".

 
Level Citoyenneté
Postage stamps

 What is the MOONMAN25?Moonman25 is a brand-new artistic form. We have spent two years in research. As its potential and range exceed our imagination, many thoughts and creations await further development. The Moonman Studio has a strong design team, which will complete more amazing artwork with your support.Moonman25 is artwork and also fashionable decoration. They are totally hand-made, each one infused with the inspirations of the designers, instead of simple duplication. Thus each work is unique, it has a unique artistic form, creating an amazing visual effect in an enclosed and transparent space. With its complicated production craftsmanship and enclosed form, it is beyond duplication and imitation. All of these endow it with the value of collection.Moonman25 is expensive because of high cost in production and transportation. But you should know it is unique in this world. No similar product is available in the market. It is worthwhile. You are supporting the birth of a great art. We hope that you get more happiness and wonders when Moonman25 joins your life. Why Fund us on Indiegogo?We are trying to strengthen and expand our team. by creating a crowdfunding project, we hope to raise funds for the production of Moonman25, and share the amazing artwork with the world.Your support is significant for us.

With the joining and delicate color depiction, it completes its dreamlike theme. At last the resin is injected and solidified, thus permanently sealing a beautiful moment.The production involves many craftsmanship procedures: design, sculpture, joining, painting, solidifying, sanding and polishing.Moonman25 consists of two parts, namely, the main body and the base. The main body is the artwork while the base is a device for emitting the lights. Vibration components are used to control the colors of the lights. Multiple colors are available. By lightly knocking the base, you will certainly find your favorite color effect. So far Moonman25 has four varieties for your selection.Moonman25-1(Robot): Inside is arranged with a light guiding system to more vividly showcase the flow of energy. This is a perfect artistic demonstration of artificial intelligence.Moonman25-2(Flower of Life): With the combination of fantasy and exquisiteness, it is an art calming down the soul.Moonman25-3(Flower Fairy): A dreamlike fairy tale.Moonman25-4(Flower Soul): A magical flower to show magical colors.      Moonman25-1    78W x 78L x 210H (mm)   Color: BlueMoonman25-2   78W x 78L x 210H (mm)   Color: Blue   Moonman25-3   78W x 78L x 150H (mm)   Color: Purple  Moonman25-4   78W x 78L x 87H (mm)     Color: Purple​

I very recently (last week) graduated from the MFA program in studio art at Florida State University. Before that, I was active within the arts community in Atlanta (my home city) for about five years, and before that, I graduated from the studio art program at Kenyon College in Ohio. </p><p>Here is my website if you would like to see some of my work: <a href=""http://www.chelsearaflo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.chelsearaflo.com</a>.</p><p>I was just selected to be an artist-in-residence at Artspace in Raleigh, North Carolina as part of their <a href=""http://artspacenc.org/artists/opportunities/call-for-residencies/regional/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Regional Emerging Artist Residency Program</a>.  :O :) wow! Thanks Artspace :D :D</p><p>For more info on this vibrant and well-respected art center, check out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsoM1D1pMn8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this video</a> made for their 30-year anniversary.</p><p>The residency is a six-month program (July - January), which is kinda rare- the majority of residency programs in the United States are anywhere from one to three month periods.</p><p>I will be going to Artspace to focus on soft sculpture, textiles, and traditional methods of garment construction. Raleigh has a rich history when it comes to the textile industry, so there are a lot of resources available for me to explore. </p><p>The Artspace residency is a little different from some other programs in that it is much more public: my studio space will be in their downtown location, which gets a considerable amount of foot traffic, is open for First Friday art walks, etc. I'll be teaching workshops and organizing self-initiated events at the center. They encourage community partnerships and collaboration, and I'll be working alongside a lot of talented and creative people. After three years of what we like to call ""artistic incubation"" here at FSU, I'm totally ready to change gears, open up, and put myself out there in a more deliberate way.</p><p>I have plans for a new body of work, but also for some wearable collections inspired by all the stuff that I love about sculpture, drawing, and painting. In the ""perks"" section, you'll see that donations of $100 or more will get you your own custom piece of wearable art. More details on this will soon emerge! Emerge.</p><p><strong>THE THING IS...this opportunity is UNPAID</strong>- that is, in cash dollars. So while it won't cost me anything to participate, there are the associated relocation costs, new housing, supplies, paying my bills, eating, and paying my ghoulish undergrad student loans that are juuuuust cackling their little cackles now that I'm out of school forever.</p><p>ALSO, during this time, I was offered a scholarship to a weeklong workshop making cement jewelry at <a href=""https://www.andersonranch.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anderson Ranch</a> Arts Center in Colorado- another great opportunity and one that ties in directly to my goals for the residency! This one, too, comes with some expenses- namely, flying out to Colorado, housing costs for one week in Aspen, and supplies (overall totaling about $1500).</p><p>Like I said, I just graduated...so I don't have a full-time job yet- in Raleigh or anywhere. I'm committing to six months as an artist-in-residence without knowing where I'll land once I get there, which is why I'm crowdfunding for a safety net. </p><p>I'm fortunate enough to be adjuncting an online class through FSU, and I'm no stranger to juggling my art practice with bartending and some side jobs. But I need your support to get out there and get by! Think of it as a kindhearted graduation present, or a generous tax write-off, or- OR- maybe you genuinely appreciate my artwork and you would like to see it flourish. All of these things can be true. </p><p>Thank you for reading this and please know that <strong>any amount helps, for real!</strong> </p><p> </p><p><i>If you're curious why my fundraising goal has been set at $4000:</i></p><p>Relocation (one month of paying rent on two places so I don't break my lease + new security deposit + U-Haul truck ): ~$1300</p><p>Supplies (fixing or replacing my broken computer + monthly budget of at least $100 for materials + sewing machine of my own bc the one I have now is a loan): ~$1500</p><p>Life costs* (phone bill, rent/utilities, car insurance, food, student loans, miscellaneous): $1200/month min.*</p><p>Anderson Ranch costs: ~$1500 (see above)</p><p>*HEY BTW, I don't want to imply that I think my wants/needs are anyone else's responsibility. However, the fact is that I will be doing a high level of job-like work for six months without any guaranteed level of job-like compensation, and your support literally increases the amount of hours in the day that I am able to spend in my studio, versus outside employment. My point here is not that I don't feel that I should be working anywhere in addition to my studio practice- it's simply that help...is helpful...and makes the balancing of multiple income streams much more doable! I hope you get it!</p><p>THANK YOU FOR READING! </p><p> </p><p>(P.S.: Indiegogo informed me that campaigns with videos receive 2000% more funding toward their goal than campaigns without. Lol. Ok then... Here u go. ^^^</p><p>Thank you to Neil Bromhall at <a href=""http://www.rightplants4me.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rightplants4me.co.uk</a>, who made the original video that I APPROPRIATED.

So while it won't cost me anything to participate, there are the associated relocation costs, new housing, supplies, paying my bills, eating, and paying my ghoulish undergrad student loans that are juuuuust cackling their little cackles now that I'm out of school forever.ALSO, during this time, I was offered a scholarship to a weeklong workshop making cement jewelry at Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Colorado- another great opportunity and one that ties in directly to my goals for the residency! This one, too, comes with some expenses- namely, flying out to Colorado, housing costs for one week in Aspen, and supplies (overall totaling about $1500).Like I said, I just graduated...so I don't have a full-time job yet- in Raleigh or anywhere. I'm committing to six months as an artist-in-residence without knowing where I'll land once I get there, which is why I'm crowdfunding for a safety net. I'm fortunate enough to be adjuncting an online class through FSU, and I'm no stranger to juggling my art practice with bartending and some side jobs. But I need your support to get out there and get by! Think of it as a kindhearted graduation present, or a generous tax write-off, or- OR- maybe you genuinely appreciate my artwork and you would like to see it flourish. All of these things can be true. Thank you for reading this and please know that any amount helps, for real!  If you're curious why my fundraising goal has been set at $4000:Relocation (one month of paying rent on two places so I don't break my lease + new security deposit + U-Haul truck ): ~$1300Supplies (fixing or replacing my broken computer + monthly budget of at least $100 for materials + sewing machine of my own bc the one I have now is a loan): ~$1500Life costs* (phone bill, rent/utilities, car insurance, food, student loans, miscellaneous): $1200/month min.*Anderson Ranch costs: ~$1500 (see above)*HEY BTW, I don't want to imply that I think my wants/needs are anyone else's responsibility. However, the fact is that I will be doing a high level of job-like work for six months without any guaranteed level of job-like compensation, and your support literally increases the amount of hours in the day that I am able to spend in my studio, versus outside employment. My point here is not that I don't feel that I should be working anywhere in addition to my studio practice- it's simply that help...is helpful...and makes the balancing of multiple income streams much more doable! I hope you get it!THANK YOU FOR READING!  (P.S.: Indiegogo informed me that campaigns with videos receive 2000% more funding toward their goal than campaigns without. Lol. Ok then... Here u go. ^^^Thank you to Neil Bromhall at www.rightplants4me.co.uk, who made the original video that I APPROPRIATED. Also to the ""24/7 Lofi hip hop radio"" channel from College Music on Youtube for the song that I looped, please don't sue me as I am clearly NOT good for it.)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Gigsville is celebrating it's 20th anniversary on the playa.  So we thought we would try something new to mark the occasion and bring some lights.  Luckily, while attending Burning Flipside in Texas, some friends had already produced such a project.  The 240 foot L2C Screen was created by a group of Austin Burners led by Chainsaw and !Bob.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are working to get the wall from Austin TX to Black Rock City.  This campaign is to pay for making it playa ready and for transportation on the community truck.</p>
<p>If you contribute at least $10 you get a special commemorative patch.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Gigsville has always been known as the Black Hole of Black Rock, even when we try to make it otherwise.  We once built an Uberman partially to help us find our way home.</p>
<p>This year we have been placed at the 3:00 keyhole on the Esplanade.  We need to step it up and make sure that we can find our way home with 120 feet of bad ass blinkie.  In addition to color goodness, it can do text and boy do we have some ideas for that.</p>

</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>If you don't have any cash currently, but still want to contribute:</p>

It creates a context of critical thinking and also a potential to develop the depth of a further discourse in personal methodology and philosophy. All artists in residence came from all over the world. We often hung out and shared thoughts with each other in our studios. It has a very energetic vibe.

Not only did I have studio space to work, but a range of studio visitors who I could show my work to. This was invaluable not just as a networking tool, but also gave me more experience in speaking about my work to different people from a range of artistic backgrounds and perspectives. This in turn inspired me in my approach to my own work. Thanks to one of the visits, I was invited to screen some of my videos as part of a show at Vox Populi, Philadelphia, curated by Katya Grokhovsky. I also travelled to Miami to do a live performance at The Harold Golen Gallery.  Another great aspect to the residency is the weekly events planned at NARS.

<p><span>Situated in the I AM HEALING Sanctuary, Geodesic! created a sacred space which transformed itself as well as it's occupants.</span></p>
<p><span>By the end of the night, as people returned from the dance floor, the dome was packed. Lucinda Loves lead a group sound healing incorporating her crystal bowls and tuning forks with the projections and soundscapes. We activated and rejuvenated with light, sound, cacao, incense, essential oils, and much needed massage after a days worth of ecstatic dancing, transforming Geodesic! into a multisensory healing experience!</span></p>
<h2>Geodesic! needs you!</h2>
<p><span>So far Geodesic! has been entirely self-funded. This includes the 16ft 3V dome, 3 projectors, sheer cover, LEDs, speaker system, foam tiles, electronics, and materials.</span></p>
<p><span>Geodesic! needs your help to get through the final stages.</span></p>
<p><span>The Giza pyramid enclosures are still being built and need to be fitted with access panels and adequate ventilation.</span></p>
<p><span>Transporting and providing electricity for Geodesic! is the largest forth coming expense.</span></p>
<p><span>Purchasing a generator is much more economical than renting one for multiple weeks sporadically throughout the years. With it's own generator, Geodesic! and it's future projects will be entirely energy sufficient. </span></p>
<p><span>By donating towards a generator, it will be much more affordable for Geodesic! to come to a music and arts festival near you!</span></p>
<p><span>Your donations will help to create an experience that will be cherished by many.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h2><span><strong>The Goal</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>In order to travel to Burning man, Geodesic! needs at least $2400</span></p>
<p><span>$800 to purchase a used Honda EU2000i generator</span></p>
<p><span>$125 for generator gasoline</span></p>
<p><span>$500 for trailer rental </span></p>
<p><span>$500 for workshop rental (Pyramids)</span></p>
<p><span>$250 for remaining materials (Plywood, 2x2s, misc. construction)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span><strong>The Extra Mile</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Geodesic! could use some maintenance. The hand made sheer cover has become worn and stained. </span></p>
<p><span>$600 would allow me to have a new more durable and form fitting cover professionally made to last for many more seasons and installations!</span></p>
<p><span>$100 would allow me to order new LEDs.</span></p>
<p><span>The current LEDs were custom ordered but were spray painted black after the fact, consequently the black paint has been rubbing off in the heat and staining the white cover. </span></p>
<p><span>$500 Geodesic! will be able to go to Symbiosis!</span></p>
<p><span>If the goal is not met, funds will be used to fulfill perks and rent equipment rather than purchase it. When</span><span> the goal is exceeded, Geodesic! will be able to travel to even more festivals and gatherings!</span></p>

The Vision
My goal is to create transformational experiences. Through immersive interactive environments, I aim to empower the participant by shifting their consciousness, presenting an opportunity for personal reflection, revelation, and transformation.
Geodesic! invites you to interact, reflect, and transform while being bathed by light, sound and even smell. It's sheer skin comes to life with fractal geometry while LEDs glow with a spectrum of color. Ultrasonic sensors on the inside of the dome will allow you to interact with and shape the experience.
Art is multidimensional, it is about every experience and interaction that happens because of it, and the connections and communities that are made around it. By challenging our boundaries, combining ideas, and encouraging interactions, a new world is created around us.
With your help, Geodesic! will be co-creating at Burning Man in August. 
Together, we Co-Create our Reality.
What is it?

 
Geodesic! is a 16ft 3V self-built metal conduit geodesic dome covered with a translucent sheer fabric so it can be experienced form both inside and out.
4ft Giza proportion pyramids house 3 2200 lumen projectors that envelop Geodesic! with fractal geometry and immersive animations. 
Addressable RGB LEDs at each vertex of the dome are controlled by an Arduino which interfaces with a MacBook Pro. LEDs, Projections, and mist, can be controlled via midi by Ableton Live, Resolume Avenue, and Ultrasonic Sensors.
Two speakers provide ambient soundscapes and effects which further propel the participant into metaphysical bliss.

<h3>The project</h3>
<p>Traditional paintings were often funded by patrons on the condition they were included within the work; this project takes that idea a step further.</p>
<p>Each patron will have his or her name forever carved by hand into the woodcut and printed also by hand to be part of a much larger work.</p>
<p>The size of the patrons area is determined by how much funding they give, 1/2 inch square per £1 donation, this will show how much they truly value the art and allow them to show everyone.</p>
<p>This first instalment will be 8'x4', room for 18,432 prints, the first of 54 similar works.</p>
<p>The final aim of the project is to reach One Million prints, about 1736 square feet of ink, one of the largest wood cuts in the world and years of work for me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where the money goes</h3>
<p>I live, work and study in the centre of London, a student of fine art, a Scout leader and a retail assistant for Cotswolds outdoors, money and time seem to constantly be in short supply.</p>
<p>The majority of the money will go towards funding my overseas studies. I will be spending 5 months abroad next year learning all there is to learn from the world and bringing it back here to expand my art and hopefully make an impact on the art world.</p>
<p>I spend three days of the week working in retail just to survive in central London. The extra funding will mean I can concentrate more on my studies and give me a chance to start volunteering again with the Scout Association during my weekends.</p>

Make no mistake, Rich has made more intricate top designs, but this is the perfect balance in my opinion. Lots of high end detail work AND a powerful performer (many intricate designs spin for less time due to wind resistance &amp; drag), and that’s why the Navigator is my personal favorite design.

<p>So if you've watched my campaign video (and if not, why not?) you know already that I am rich in pixels, but not in much else, and that if I hope to send this pair of archival prints off to about ten of my very favorite libraries then I must convince you to do the same thing for that one library that means the most to you.</p>
<p>If we reach the funding goal for the campaign then I'll be able to send my prints off to those libraries I've loved. I hope we will!</p>
<p>But in fact, that's just where things start. <br/>Because what I really hope is that a whole lot more of you will pile on to do this nice, impractical thing for your libraries and the librarians who work in them; and if I'm right, then we'll raise enough money that I can contribute actual, real cash dollars to the public library in my own small town.</p>
<p>I'd love to send money to <em>everybody's</em> favorite libraries - but by the time we spread those dollars out across the whole lot of them, we'd probably just be buying each library a nice hot latte. That's not to be snorted at, mind you: but I hate to think of all those librarians fighting over that one hot cup of joe. So in this case I figure we're all better off if I act locally, the way the bumper stickers tell us to do.</p>

<h3> About the Prints</h3>
<p>There's a right panel, and a left panel, in this set of two prints. Each one measures 20"" by 30"" (including that blue margin we see all around them) and I've rendered them at 300 pixels to the inch.</p>
<p>As this campaign begins I have rendered out all of the layers and masks I need to complete them, but I haven't yet started my post work in Photoshop. I'd be surprised if that amounted to more than about ten days of uninterrupted work - although it's true that  I do <em>get</em> surprised sometimes. But there shouldn't be any difficulty in finishing the images before the end of this campaign.</p>
<p>There are a couple of areas where now that I've seen the images in their full resolution I may want to go back, rework some details, and re-render those small areas. That's business as usual when I work on this scale.</p>
<p>They'll be printed using an archival photographic process on heavy weight, glossy paper. This is exactly what I do with the other archival prints that I sell through my <em><a href=""http://shop.webomator.com/retropolis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Retropolis</a></em> web site. They're really, really nice.</p>
<p>When you sponsor a gift of these prints to your favorite library I'll include a letter to the library that tells them that it was you who sponsored the gift. I'll probably mention what a nice person you are.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.webomator.com/indiegogo/libraries/hbar.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</h3>
<p>You've seen that the pictures are in their final stage, and I've told you about how long it should take me to complete them. You may not know me; but I can point you at a few of my web sites (<em><a href=""http://shop.webomator.com/retropolis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Retropolis: the Art of the Future That Never Was"">Retropolis</a></em>, <em><a href=""http://shop.webomator.com/celtic-art-works/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Celtic Art Works"">The Celtic Art Works</a></em>, and <a href=""http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual</em></a>) as proof that I'm not new to this kind of work and that I probably know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that a client will be bringing me a web site redesign project during the months of November or December, and that could disrupt my schedule. That's the reason why I've launched this campaign before the pictures are done.</p>
<p>Here's another thing, though: these libraries haven't asked for the prints. In most cases they will not know that they're coming. There's no way of knowing what they will choose to do with them. Some may get framed and hung publicly; some may get stuck up in a library's administrative offices, possibly with thumb tacks; some lucky and fast-moving librarians may end up taking them home. We don't know, and in my opinion it doesn't matter. They're gifts! People can do whatever they like with them.</p>
<p>I've posted very conservative shipping dates for the prints (January 20). In fact I hope to ship them sooner but I've found that packing and shipping rewards can take a lot longer than I expect - and anyway I've never placed such a large order with my printer, and I have no idea how long they'll need to produce (I hope!) hundreds of these. So for those reasons, not to mention what shipping is like near the holidays, I'm promising to ship these early next year even though I think they may go out sooner.</p>

<h3>Questions that might have been asked frequently if I weren't writing this in advance</h3>
<p>1. Wouldn't it be a lot better if we all just gave cash to our own local libraries?</p>
<p>Yep, they need money a lot more than they need prints. If your question is practical (that is, if you've got your checkbook out and you're ready to hand your money over) then by all means, go away and give them money right now. But if your question is theoretical (that is, you're a nitpicker by nature) then you'll just need to sort it out for yourself.</p>
<p>2. Are these contributions tax deductible?</p>
<p>Nope. I'm not a nonprofit, and it's me that's receiving the funds. Even I can't write off the cost of the prints that we send out because there's no way for me to document that the receiving libraries are nonprofits; I think it's often their community organizations that have nonprofit status. The one part of this that <em>is</em> a write-off for me is the cash contribution to my own local library. I need that deduction since otherwise the money that passes through my bank account looks like income.</p>
<p>3. Am I making money from this?</p>
<p>Up to the campaign goal, all of the funding goes toward the prints you sponsor and the prints I send to my ten or so favorite libraries. If we exceed the goal I do stand to make a little money because we're not funding my own prints any more; that's why the excess starts to go to my local library (and my own tax liability). If we sell a godawful lot of prints, I do stand to make some money. I don't mind. But if that bothers you, go back to #1 and get out your checkbook.</p>
<p>4. Is this campaign in any way endorsed by, sponsored by, encouraged by, or does it involve any public library, including my own local library?</p>
<p>Nope. It's just me. Although I'm fond of my local library it has no affiliation with me and if anything goes wrong here, they didn't do it, didn't know about it, and would have been horrified if they even suspected that I might take all your money and run off to Fiji. Which I'm not going to do. I'm just saying that this campaign is entirely the responsibility of me, and no other person or entity.</p>

About the Campaign
So if you've watched my campaign video (and if not, why not?) you know already that I am rich in pixels, but not in much else, and that if I hope to send this pair of archival prints off to about ten of my very favorite libraries then I must convince you to do the same thing for that one library that means the most to you.
If we reach the funding goal for the campaign then I'll be able to send my prints off to those libraries I've loved. I hope we will!
But in fact, that's just where things start. Because what I really hope is that a whole lot more of you will pile on to do this nice, impractical thing for your libraries and the librarians who work in them; and if I'm right, then we'll raise enough money that I can contribute actual, real cash dollars to the public library in my own small town.
I'd love to send money to everybody's favorite libraries - but by the time we spread those dollars out across the whole lot of them, we'd probably just be buying each library a nice hot latte. That's not to be snorted at, mind you: but I hate to think of all those librarians fighting over that one hot cup of joe. So in this case I figure we're all better off if I act locally, the way the bumper stickers tell us to do.

If we exceed the goal I do stand to make a little money because we're not funding my own prints any more; that's why the excess starts to go to my local library (and my own tax liability). If we sell a godawful lot of prints, I do stand to make some money. I don't mind. But if that bothers you, go back to #1 and get out your checkbook.
4. Is this campaign in any way endorsed by, sponsored by, encouraged by, or does it involve any public library, including my own local library?
Nope. It's just me. Although I'm fond of my local library it has no affiliation with me and if anything goes wrong here, they didn't do it, didn't know about it, and would have been horrified if they even suspected that I might take all your money and run off to Fiji. Which I'm not going to do. I'm just saying that this campaign is entirely the responsibility of me, and no other person or entity.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are an independent production team determined to put on a 3 day event to satisfy all of your senses and leave you in awe! <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p>Carly Tryens and Aron Blue now have 2 art/music shows under their belts and are planning the third, titled 3HREE. The show is being held at 3 Egg Studios on 79 Lorimer St. in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This show is unique because there are three event-filled opening nights!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Friday</span>, May 6th, 7-12am</p>
<p>Matthew Clark will be creating a metal sculpture LIVE on the sidewalk in front of the building from 7-10.  This is an amazing opportunity to see the process an artist goes through.  His sketches and notes will be on display and there will be a chance to talk to the artist personally about his process after the event.  THEN, inside pedal-steel extraordinaire, Phil Sterk will be performing original music to accompany the fine art and sculptures displayed throughout the studio.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Saturday</span>, May 7th, 7-12am<br/></p>
<p>Matthew Varvil takes the stage at 10pm to perform his shadow theater.  This is an elaborate but short performance and we suggest you arrive early to be sure it is not missed.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<br/>Putting on a show as vast and extraordinary as this costs money.  The money that you donate will go towards paying the musicians, the (overly expensive, thank you NY state) permit to have Matthew Clark create on the sidewalk, food, the production cost of making the recording of David's live performance and hopefully if we exceed our budget pay back the artists who have donated their pieces as gifts to gracious supporters like you! <br/><br/>If we can not make this money in time we will unfortunately have to compensate.  We have a prioritized list of what we are willing to pay for out of our shallow pockets.  For example, of course we will not let a little money stand in the way of having David Amram grace us with his amazing talent and inspiration.  <br/><br/>Your support will make all of this happen.  If everyone could donate $5 who is excited to see a sculpture being made LIVE on a summer night in Williamsburg <br/><br/>or a beautiful pedal steel player who will bring you to tears with his talent<br/><br/>or an original shadow theater performance by an artist raved about in New Orleans<br/><br/>or DAVID AMRAM (come on!)<br/><br/>not to mention all of the incredible art and sculptures on display for all 3 nights then this event could happen smoothly and we will have plenty more to come(we already talking about a possible show in August if this is a success)!<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Indiegogo is our main sourse of fundraising.  We will also be having a dinner party to show a video and explain in person what we are doing and why we need help in hopes of raising some money.  But this is where we expect to get the damage done.  None of this money is going to us.  Even if there is any money made over our budget we have a list of supporters that we would like to thank with a small check.  We are in fact only asking a suggested donation of 20% (which is so small comparatively) of any artwork sold.  That is almost unheard of.  This show must be a success for us to continue bringing you incredible weekends like this.  <br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every dollar helps but if you are not in a position to help please send this to anyone who you think would be interested.  And mark your calendar for May 6th, 7th and 8th and we'll see you at 79 Lorimer for 3HREE!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Last but definately not least we would like to thank Lele Galer of <a href=""http://galerestate.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Galer Estate Vineyard and Winery</a> for graciously donating her amazing locally grown wine.  We are so so thankful for generous people like her who are making this show possible!</p>

Large format giclee printing for posters & archival art prints 24"" wide by any length. Film output for screens up to 36""x60"" or litho plates. Pairs perfectly with the letterpress & book binding equipment.
BUTTON PRESSES

InterArts has the benefit of many pre-existing components, such as an abundance of equipment, personnel and experience. So we're not starting completely from scratch. But we need a space, which is where you come in; we need helping funding a space, we need help creating the space and we need help using the space. Using the space will be the easy part, though we're hoping you can help with funding and creating the space.

<h3>What Are The Omen?</h3>
<p>The Omen is a collection of symbols, interpretations, dreams, and premonitions appearing in my first official Gallery show.  </p>
<p>The collection of prints, drawings, sculptures, paintings, and themes being presented are all interconnected, and work symbiotically as a key. The gallery of artwork represents a transformation over a span of three years, and animates the past, present, and imminent future of my experiences here in Ithaca, NY. The pieces are a series pathways and snapshots to my realizations and fears, all within the context of each medium, forever chained to the existence of our never-ending story.</p>
<p>The artwork for sale can be found below, and are matched up with their donation amounts on the right by name.</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>It is important for me to show, and sell people my artwork. Although I am emotionally connected to my work, and respect my process enough to charge for it, most of the artwork for sale is underpriced.</p>
<p>As a donor, what you will be paying for is</p>
<ul>
<li>My time</li>
<li>Supplies to make the work</li>
<li>Shipping (this is a pretty big deal if you live outside NY state, getting my work safely to you will be more expensive than if you live locally)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have broken down most of my pieces to a simple equation considering these factors, in order to charge appropriate amounts for my work, and make sure it is affordable. I believe that artists who overcharge for their work end up devaluing it in the long-run. My goal is to share my work affordably, and make sure my patrons are happy to become connected to my experience as an artist. </p>
<p>What you will recieve when you buy a piece of my artwork is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sticker from my Gallery show (shown below)</li>
<li>A Certificate of Authenticity (bill of sale)</li>
<li>A personal letter detailing the background and meaning of the work</li>
<li>The artwork itself</li>
<li>(Optional) A spot on my patron list to receive discounts and updates on my future work </li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to share my work, and build a closer connection to those who help support me. By donating to this campaign you are investing in my future, I want to develop relationships with the people who help me achieve this dream of mine, and hope to do so with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Here is some pictures of my work for sale, you can find my other work on my Tumblr (<a href=""http://www.itfellfromthesky.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.itfellfromthesky.tumblr.com</a>)</p>

<p>Melanoma is a cancer that has no boundaries on whom it invades.  It matters not your age, your skin color or your gender.  It can kill you quickly but if found, you can manage it and live a long and wonderful life.</p>
<p>For Julia Knight, melanoma came unannounced.  It was only through a phone conversation with a friend, who had just learned that she had melanoma, did Julia decide to take action and get her skin checked.  As it turned out, this action saved her life.</p>
<p><span><span>Living with melanoma has reshaped Julia's life. This disease has not only challenged her physically, but also emotionally -- balancing the chaos caused from multiple surgeries, along with summoning the inner strength needed in order to curb this guaranteed promise of death if any mole is ignored.</span></span></p>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p>The inspiration for SKIN comes from Julia's story.</p>
<p>With SKIN, we want to raise awareness on how to pay attention to your skin -- how to care for it, celebrate and honor its ephemeral nature -- and we want you to learn more about Melanoma. Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, but, a simple trip to the dermatologist to get your skin checked can ensure many years of a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p><strong>THE INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p>We intend to raise awareness by creating a multi-media installation that invites the viewer to immerse themselves into a visceral and sensory meditation on SKIN.  The installation will include film, spoken word, photography, and surround sound. Interactive elements will also be included to encourage the viewer to express their feelings about how they relate to their skin and to other's skin.</p>
<p>We will also provide reading materials so that those who attend can walk away with information on melanoma.</p>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>We ask for your support in our quest to raise funds so that we may realize this project.  Funds given by you will be invested into the completion of the film (production + postproduction) and the audio design (recording the two poems + SKIN soundtrack + surround sound design).  And, if we pass our goal, we can then purchase materials for the installation and create the interactive design.</p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN BE INVOLVED</strong></p>
<p>Your support is vital in helping us raise awareness.  By contributing to our campaign via Paypal or credit card and/or sharing our SKIN teaser with others through social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr), email or word of mouth, you could be saving the life of a friend and/or sharing SKIN'S message about loving and respecting one's skin.</p>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p>Much love, passion and hard work went into creating our SKIN teaser. We are excited about realizing this work and we are thrilled to have you join our journey.</p>

<h3>Everyone gets angry, sometimes.</h3>
<p>It might be that guy who cut you off on exit 5. Maybe they ran out of glazed donuts. Maybe you run an advice podcast and someone sent you their math homework. It happens. People get angry.</p>
<p>A lot of different people have come up with a lot of different solutions for dealing with anger. Yoga, tea, alcohol, any number of remedies can be good for some people. Some people however, just need to <em>flip a table</em>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Portable Flipping Table</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Flipping tables can be hazardous. Sometimes the table can take a strange trajectory while airborne and take an eye out. Sometimes it might hit a wall and put a hole in it. They're unwieldy beasts, and they're not very portable.</p>
<p>We've developed a small, portable table that is made for one true purpose, <em>to flip</em>. And how glorious it feels to flip that table. Got an F on that social studies test? Flip this table. That pretty lady turned you down? Flip this table. Milk went bad because you didn't drink it fast enough? Well, stop buying gallons, start buying half gallons. Oh, and flip this table.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Incentives</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79396/table/2FlippingTable.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79396/table/3FamilyPackage.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79396/table/4DramaticEffect.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79396/table/5WearYourRage.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79396/table/6WearAndShotGlass.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79396/table/7WholesalePackage.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>We're working with Trendex, the company behind great products like the Minecraft Foam <a href=""http://www.levelupstudios.com/foam-sword"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swords</a> / <a href=""http://www.levelupstudios.com/pickaxe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pick Axes</a>, the <a href=""http://www.levelupstudios.com/portal-cookiecutters"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portal 2 Cookie Cutters</a>, the <a href=""http://www.levelupstudios.com/turret-figure"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Talking Turret</a> toys, and a slew of other well-manufactured toys. We want to make something that isn't going to break after a couple of flips. Making a quality toy isn't cheap. </p>
<p>The mold itself is the most expensive part of the process. The mold for our table is going to cost $3,300, and the tables themselves are going to cost even more. So. that's why we need to raise at least $5,330. We've got a number of great stretch goals that will make the product more fun, and in the event of great success, we'll also be making some of our other pet projects a reality.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79396/tableStats.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$5,850</strong> - All tables will get an additional optional keychain attachment. <strong>EDIT: DONE</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$6,500</strong> - All tables will get a deluxe art box for safe keeping. <strong>EDIT: DONE</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$7,000</strong> - We'll buy a low-end Mac and port Love+ to Linux and Mac OS X. note: I've decided that if we can hit the $7K mark, I'll pay the rest out of my own pocket.</li>
<li>
<strong>$8,500</strong> - We'll get a print run of James Bennet's Moon Dogs &amp; Other Toy Animals, and everyone who donates over $35 to the project will get it added to their order for <em><strong>free</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Free Bonuses</h3>
<p>Everyone who donates at least $5 to our cause will be receiving a nice little slew of free downloadable content, including but not limited to:</p>

</ul>

A lot of different people have come up with a lot of different solutions for dealing with anger. Yoga, tea, alcohol, any number of remedies can be good for some people. Some people however, just need to flip a table.
The Portable Flipping Table


Flipping tables can be hazardous. Sometimes the table can take a strange trajectory while airborne and take an eye out. Sometimes it might hit a wall and put a hole in it. They're unwieldy beasts, and they're not very portable.
We've developed a small, portable table that is made for one true purpose, to flip. And how glorious it feels to flip that table. Got an F on that social studies test? Flip this table. That pretty lady turned you down? Flip this table. Milk went bad because you didn't drink it fast enough? Well, stop buying gallons, start buying half gallons. Oh, and flip this table.


Incentives

The Cost
We're working with Trendex, the company behind great products like the Minecraft Foam Swords / Pick Axes, the Portal 2 Cookie Cutters, the Talking Turret toys, and a slew of other well-manufactured toys. We want to make something that isn't going to break after a couple of flips. Making a quality toy isn't cheap. 
The mold itself is the most expensive part of the process. The mold for our table is going to cost $3,300, and the tables themselves are going to cost even more. So. that's why we need to raise at least $5,330. We've got a number of great stretch goals that will make the product more fun, and in the event of great success, we'll also be making some of our other pet projects a reality.
Stretch Goals



$5,850 - All tables will get an additional optional keychain attachment. EDIT: DONE


$6,500 - All tables will get a deluxe art box for safe keeping. EDIT: DONE


$7,000 - We'll buy a low-end Mac and port Love+ to Linux and Mac OS X. note: I've decided that if we can hit the $7K mark, I'll pay the rest out of my own pocket.

$8,500 - We'll get a print run of James Bennet's Moon Dogs & Other Toy Animals, and everyone who donates over $35 to the project will get it added to their order for free.

Free Bonuses
Everyone who donates at least $5 to our cause will be receiving a nice little slew of free downloadable content, including but not limited to:

A DRM-Free copy of Love+
James Bennett's 2006 EP ""Moondogs & Other Toy Animals""
Sure to be Ban'D Year One (in PDF format)
Exclusive Bancast Clips that were just a little to rough to broadcast.

A Special Message from Michelle Alexander

Dear friends, 

I was excited to learn that the Veterans of Hope Project (VoH) has teamed with Daniel Hunter, a talented community organizer and author, to begin laying the groundwork for the writing of this much-needed booklet: Building the Movement to End the New Jim Crow. Thisnew resource will serve as a powerful and useful follow up to VoH's previous publication, the New Jim Crow Study Guide and Call to Action, which has been distributed nationwide to hundreds of congregations, re-entry centers, book groups, and schools. 
In recent years, I've become acutely aware of the need for a booklet or guide that will help people take action to end mass incarceration.  As I've traveled around the country spreading the message of The New Jim Crow, I've met countless people who are ready and willing to join the movement -- people of faith, people behind bars, formerly incarcerated people, mothers and fathers of incarcerated children, judges, teachers, community activists, health care workers, unemployed people, and the very rich.  I've received hundreds of emails and letters from people of all colors and backgrounds who have awakened to the horror and crisis of mass incarceration in the United States and who want to take action.   They all ask the same question:  What can I do? 
This booklet aims to answer that question by lifting up the heroic and inspiring efforts of ordinary people around the country who are building an extraordinary new movement -- a multi-racial, multi-ethnic human rights movement that seeks not only to end mass incarceration, but also to break our nation's habit of creating caste-like systems in America.  
The tactics, strategies, and forms of advocacy undertaken in this movement undoubtedly will vary across the nation, depending on our circumstances and locales.  There will be successes and failures.   But we will remain inspired to persevere if we listen to each other's stories and learn from each other's victories and challenges. I'm thrilled that people like Daniel and organizations like Veterans of Hope are stepping up to offer much-needed guidance and inspiration. 


Thanks so much for supporting this project, and for all that you do to help build this movement.

<h3>What Is The Giving Lens?</h3>
<strong>We believe that photography can make a difference.</strong> We build teams of photographers looking to combine their greatest passion with a worthy cause overseas. We travel overseas where we not only do amazing workshops in country, but spend up to half the trip volunteering with an amazing, local, grassroots non-profit. <p>So, we build trips that connect teams of passionate photographers with worthy Non-Profit doing incredible work. We get a whole team of willing photographers to a nation and facilitate your experience on the ground. We volunteer our camera, hearts, time, and energy in whatever way the Non-Profit needs most. Sometimes this is by documenting their work for media and website purposes. Other times it is by teaching photography classes to kids who need creative outlets to express themselves. And yet other times it can be physically getting our hands dirty and helping out. There is no limit to what we are capable of. Each trip is different and offers a unique, once-in-a-lifetime experience - from impactful volunteer work, to incredible photography workshops at unbelievable locations. </p>
<div>
<br/><div>By participating in a TGL (The Giving Lens) Trip you are allowing yourself the opportunity to explore, grow, document and work hand in hand to help make a difference with the local communities, NGO organizations and countries we will be working in. As you grow in your photography you might also be working with school children, helping to protect an endangered species, or empowering women. The ways in which photography can make the world better are limitless. <br/><div>
<br/><p><b>By partnering with us, an NGO receives:</b></p>
<p>- high quality images for their use</p>
<p>- photo-education for a community, staff, or both</p>
<p>- up to 50% of the profits from our paying participants!</p>

The exhibition will raise awareness for all the other amazing things Picaflor House is doing in Peru!
The exhibition will open doors for future funding, volunteers, awareness, attention, and more.

What Is The Giving Lens?
We believe that photography can make a difference. We build teams of photographers looking to combine their greatest passion with a worthy cause overseas. We travel overseas where we not only do amazing workshops in country, but spend up to half the trip volunteering with an amazing, local, grassroots non-profit. So, we build trips that connect teams of passionate photographers with worthy Non-Profit doing incredible work. We get a whole team of willing photographers to a nation and facilitate your experience on the ground. We volunteer our camera, hearts, time, and energy in whatever way the Non-Profit needs most. Sometimes this is by documenting their work for media and website purposes. Other times it is by teaching photography classes to kids who need creative outlets to express themselves. And yet other times it can be physically getting our hands dirty and helping out. There is no limit to what we are capable of. Each trip is different and offers a unique, once-in-a-lifetime experience - from impactful volunteer work, to incredible photography workshops at unbelievable locations. 

By participating in a TGL (The Giving Lens) Trip you are allowing yourself the opportunity to explore, grow, document and work hand in hand to help make a difference with the local communities, NGO organizations and countries we will be working in. As you grow in your photography you might also be working with school children, helping to protect an endangered species, or empowering women. The ways in which photography can make the world better are limitless. 
By partnering with us, an NGO receives:
- high quality images for their use
- photo-education for a community, staff, or both
- up to 50% of the profits from our paying participants!

<br/> <p>We believe the best design is transformative.  It beautifies boring. It magnifies good. It intensifies connection. Design incites action. But the best design in the world is typically only accessible to those with  big budgets. We want to bring Madison ave. to Main st. by making the transformative power of great design accessible to churches and the communities that surround them. <b>#designforall</b></p>
<p>Why Churches? Because we personally believe that, communicated effectively, their message is the most important message of hope the world could ever hear. This is the core of our passion. Why their Communities? Because we believe churches and the people that make them up should be devoted to the good of their communities. Church leaders and small business owners both need help to become more visible and memorable to the people they are trying to reach. Church leaders and small business owners both need to incite action. Great design can do this. We do great design. </p>
<p>My name is Aaron. I've spent 10 years pursuing my dream in a variety of professional capacities. I've served on staff as the lead designer at a 15,000 member church in Woodstock, GA. I've pursued business ownership once before and failed. And most recently I enjoyed the privilege of serving several roles at innovative juvenile brands company called <a href=""http://www.kidsii.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.kidsii.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kids II.</a> Those 4 years gave me exposure to world class design and marketing for multi-million dollar brands. They showed me what real business looks like on the inside. They positioned me alongside some of the most incredible creative talent in the world. Most importantly they prepared me to take a legitimate shot at succeeding with this dream. </p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have maintained a thriving freelance pipeline doing the work I love for the causes I care so deeply about. In June of this year, that business reached a critical mass and my wife and I made the exhilarating decision to leave the security of the Atlanta sky rise and go hard after my design agency dream from my home studio.</p>

In Kenessaw, GA, we helped Dr. Cris Welsh rebrand her family chiropractic business from Eaton Chiropractic to WHI (Whole Health Institute). The immediate result was a 30% increase in visits within the first month. 
That's just two snippets of our many success stories. 
When churches become more visible and memorable, more people attend, more lives are changed, and communities around them are transformed through their love and generosity. 
When small businesses become more visible and memorable, more people engage them, communities become more vibrant, local economies become stronger, lives of owners and lives of residents are literally made better. 
By contributing to this campaign, you are not only helping my family and enabling our dream. You are transforming communities. You are giving creatives around the world the chance to do the work they love for causes they care about. And you empowering a business with aspirations to change the world.

I stopped doing nail art altogether.<br/><br/>Now, as an adult, I want to start making tutorials again.<br/><br/>The only problem is that I got rid of all my nail supplies years ago. I don't even own a single bottle of nail polish anymore.<br/><br/>I'm just a student and I don't have a job, so it's going to be a struggle to get all the supplies I need without help. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>No matter how much money I raise, I'm going to start making videos again regardless.

My artistic skills have developed over the past few years and I have some great ideas for nail tutorials.<br/><br/>One thing I definitely need to purchase is a model hand and some false nails, because for my own personal reasons I can't wear my nails long anymore, so I'll be doing all my new designs on false nails.<br/><br/>I would also like to get a decent selection of nail polish, some acrylic paints, detailing brushes, glitters, rhinestones, striping tape, etc.<br/><br/><b>The perks for this campaign are as follows:</b><br/><br/>- Everyone who donates more than $10 AUD will get a shout out in my first new video.<br/><br/>- The first 5 people to donate $50 AUD or more will be able to have their channels featured on my channel, where they will be seen by over 38,000 people.<br/><br/>- If anyone is generous enough to donate $100 AUD or more, as a token of my gratitude I will mail you the very first set of fake nails I create for a tutorial.<br/><br/> </div>The goal I have set for this fundraiser is $500, because it's the minimum amount you can set on this website, however, realistically, if I get around $100 that should be enough for me to deliver a high quality of video.<br/><br/>Your contributions would mean the world to me.<br/><br/> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't donate, I completely understand.

My name is Muhammad Hafeez, age 34 , an active VFX and 3D Generalist born in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. Have been in the creative industry for 15years, an ex- Digital Compositor TD at Rhythm and Hues, which is a hollywood post production studio and now seeking for an opportunity to start my own project as a ""stepping stone"" for my business towards the form of art that i love. For now, im a freelancer artist, not attach to any studios or a company and neither have one :P. 
Currently, i develop only one character that is the hero himself - the goat name ROY
ROY's walkcycle;


One of my friend has donated his creativity in music scoring, this movie will expose more of asian culture, so this is some kind of ""sound"" to it.




The whole project is about a talking animal show, adaptation of south east asian culture jokes and scenario, most of it come from my country, Malaysia. Targeted for teens and above audience as an alternative flavour to my local scene, that is animation feature is just not for kids. I targeted ROY as a feature FILM, but open to any path if media (webisodes, tv series etc) when things might or might not change from time to time
A quick summary about the story:

hero character name ROY-goat and bunch of other animals within his barn.


action-romantic-comedy genre

computer generated images (3D ANIMATION)





The first step is for me to create one or two 30 seconds video teaser with great length of quality and professional look for the output. I might need some of my talented friends in this project as i am ambitious to level up it's quality more than what has been presented here in Malaysia. 




Another benefactor for crowd funding is the cost for digital ""rendering"". The final animation will be generated as a sequence of images using a rendering farm technology. It needs a super-high-end computers to complete that task. For that i located a place to rent per day or week for that task.

Kick start budget of est. 14,000 USD ""which is est. 49k in Ringgit Malaysia . It covers many aspects for me to start up an animation and multimedia company. Most of the budget will go to the computers and softwares.







... on the pitching bible (pitching materials) itself there will be.


a. a concept art of the whole storyb. paperwork's on target audience, objective and essential pitching needs.c. detail explanation of characters with single frame 3d renderd. lay out all the characters including the non-hero in the storye. a sample of walkcycle (character walking sample),a gimmick act for each characters (for pitching purpose).f. Voice act sample for characters and etc.



With your contribution, this will help the independent creative community grow and be part of the commercialization. 


 

As a token of appreciation you'll be receiving a fullHD of the 30secs itself as soon its been completed, with a graphics from the pitching bible in a ""cute booklet format"" :). Your name will be on the ending credits too.. For this, will be in computer format for digital downloading.

</div></div>","Armed with a paintbrush, kids can transform the course of their lives. With passion and creativity, no dream is too big. 


Since 2010, Hearts of the World, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, has been fostering creativity, self-exploration, and freedom of expression for children around the world through painting workshops. Light and lively discussions help participants open up in a comfortable and safe environment as they quiet their minds from the chaos of daily life and tune in to the beat of their own hearts. Partnering with schools, orphanages, and arts organizations, Hearts of the World spreads the healing power of creativity that transcends international borders. 
We are excited to announce that we are now planning projects in twelve countries over the next five years - Starting with India this spring, 2015!




    ""In my heart are my family and education; I want to go to school and fly an airplane, so I can see the world from the sky.""                                  ~ Staisy, age 4. Haiti.







During a three-hour workshop, each child is given a panel with the outline of an anatomical heart and encouraged to paint whatever is inside his or her own heart: wild dreams, intense passions, favorite past-times, even deep dark fears. While some simply let loose on the panel in a flurry of energy, others intently paint with delicate dedication.  



When they finish painting, the children are photographed with their work and asked to reflect on the meaning of their painting. We carefully transcribe their unique stories and insight to share with the world.






“What’s in your heart?”“The darkness.”“Why?”“Because the darkness is very beautiful, there are many colored lights in the darkness; it's so beautiful!""~ Michael, age 9 (born blind)Beijing, China. Bethel Orphanage for Blind Children.









This Spring, Hearts of the World will travel to India to embark on an ambitious series of workshops throughout the country. This will be the organization's biggest tour yet, aiming to host at least TWELVE workshops.


Our needs are relatively simple, but to reach as many children as possible requires the generous help of supporters like you.



Your donation provides a child with the following:

paint and paintbrushes
panel with a heart outline
snacks and goodies

photos of the child during the workshop for them to keep


Total cost: $8. We can't do this alone! For every $8 donated, another heart is unleashed.


FROM OUR HEARTS TO YOURS, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!
Interested in additional ways to help? We can always use help spreading the word, so make sure to share our campaign through social media. 
We are also looking for any helpful advice and contacts within India along our route, If you know organizations, family, friends or any one that might be interested in getting involved on the ground in India, Please let us know. 





Estimated expenses for two team members, 105 days, 12 workshops, 360 + kids, see more info at   http://heartsoftheworld.org/  

With the power of art and a passionate heart, anyone can paint a brighter future.

An artist whether dancer, musician, actor or singer uses his or her body to communicate. 
TREES joins these languages in innovative collaborations performed throughout New York City.We seek to bring together these individuals and create connections of artistic communication while establishing opportunities for artists to speak their voices, in any form, to any audience.  



Hopes

Relationships among musicians and dancers for further artistic works.
Igniting a sense of collaboration for artist to feel inspired to make art works of all types. 



   How you can join Your money makes our music stronger in these ways: 
Supporting the artists monetarily. Providing for costs of production. Publicity needs such as postcards and fliers. 


Our premiere performance is August 28th at Spike Hill Brooklyn, New York, and it is only the first note in the beginning of a beautiful song. 
Your donation will not only support this premiere performance, but it will also create a foundation for TREES to further our artistic endeavors to have more performances throughout this year.

<br/><h3>What is The Scene?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>WHRO has teamed up with <b>PBS Digital</b>
to launch a new web series called <b>""The Scene""</b>. You may wonder what The Scene is and why we are doing this. Our goal is
to make an impact in our community by producing video series that will capture
and and give prominence to underground, unknown or just under-appreciated
artists in Hampton Roads.<br/><br/>
Along with our companion <a href=""http://www.whro.org/thescene"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, each episode will
tell a unique and positive story about local artists and their craft. 
Digital storytellers are documenting specific stories covering a variety of art
themes such as street-art, tattoo, sculptures, music, painters, photographers,
performance artists, improv performers, and more.</p>
<p>We've created The Scene series so that local artists can tell their own stories
as an insider’s perspective about art in our community.<span>  They will share what they want locals and
visitors to know about how the art scene is a big part of what Hampton Roads
really is. </span></p>We have already interviewed over a dozen local artists from Hampton Roads and
started putting together their stories that they are excited to share with you
and the community.  We narrowed our first series down to eight webisodes
based on their story ideas and art, video clips and passion for the project.<br/><p>
<br/>
Each webisode, once produced, will be shared via <a href=""http://www.whro.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WHRO</a> and <u><span><a href=""http://thescene.whro.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Scene</a></span></u>, and also through the <u><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/pbsdigitalstudios"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PBS Digital Studios YouTube Channel</a></span></u>. 
The series will premiere in September 2014 with the release of a new video each
week.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<span>But
we need your help! In order to fully fund this project and make it a success,
we need to raise at least $20,000 to fund the production and editing for each
digital episode. <br/><br/>
So let's exceed our goal!  Additional funds raised will help WHRO
producers get out into the community and capture these amazing hardworking
artists and give them the exposure they deserve and create a sense of art in
the Hampton Roads community. <br/><br/>
So we're asking you to support this project, and help share these creative and
unique stories about all art in our community.<br/><br/>

<p><span class=""text_exposed_show"">HOMECOMING! presents the one-night competitive art acquisition ""Hands on an Art Body."" <br/><br/>On May 19th at 6pm at Oliver Francis Gallery, HOMECOMING! will offer its blue-chip collection of contemporary artworks to the public so to explore the intrinsic value of art within the context of competition. <br/><br/>Inspired by the film ""Hands on a Hard Body"", where twenty-four contestants compete in an endurance/sleep deprivation contest in order to win a brand new Nissan Hardbody truck, attendees are invited to place their hands on any work they desire on display within the gallery and remain with it throughout the evening. The last participant left in contact with the piece at the end of the night acquires the work at the end of the exhibition. The participants will endure bizarre installation, social deprivation, and artwork that is designed to resist the contact of the viewer. <br/><br/>A pre-reception viewing of the work up for grabs will be May 12th – 18th by appointment and the night of the reception at 6pm for three hours before the start of the competition at 9pm. During this time, those wanting to compete for work in the show will need to register and be briefed before the 9pm start. Referees, coaches and cocktail waitresses will be on-hand to mediate and assist contestants. The competition will continue until each work is left in contact with one triumphant contestant, be it hours, days or weeks.<br/><br/>""Hands on an Art Body"" explores the object/viewer relationship and evaluates the culture of ownership and value within the context of the art economy, collectors, auctions and competition. Amplified since the era of mechanical reproduction and modern social connectivity, the art object has enjoyed a level of mythos imbued upon it through insurable values, condition reports, guarded display, and published auction results. This stands to compete with the value of the object’s original artistic statement, not often connected to its trophy status and lost in the shadow of its provenance. <br/><br/>""Hands on an Art Body"" creates a platform where the included work is only allowed to function as an “art object” when in contact with its prospective owner. The relationship between the viewer and the object is no longer exclusive but essential. The show’s closing acquisition ceremony becomes less social ritual and more spectacle, as ownership of a given work is not measured by monetary capacity, but by sheer will and determination. The show’s system of acquisition would seemingly decommodify the object through constant contact while at the same time activating its purpose and commodifying it though competition for its possession.<br/><br/>Hands on an Art Body is organized by the experimental art collective HOMECOMING! based in Fort Worth, Texas.<br/><br/>Oliver Francis Gallery is located at 209 South Peak St. in Dallas, Texas. <br/><br/>The closing reception and participatory acquisition of work will be Saturday May 19th starting at 6 pm.

During this time, those wanting to compete for work in the show will need to register and be briefed before the 9pm start. Referees, coaches and cocktail waitresses will be on-hand to mediate and assist contestants. The competition will continue until each work is left in contact with one triumphant contestant, be it hours, days or weeks.""Hands on an Art Body"" explores the object/viewer relationship and evaluates the culture of ownership and value within the context of the art economy, collectors, auctions and competition. Amplified since the era of mechanical reproduction and modern social connectivity, the art object has enjoyed a level of mythos imbued upon it through insurable values, condition reports, guarded display, and published auction results. This stands to compete with the value of the object’s original artistic statement, not often connected to its trophy status and lost in the shadow of its provenance. ""Hands on an Art Body"" creates a platform where the included work is only allowed to function as an “art object” when in contact with its prospective owner. The relationship between the viewer and the object is no longer exclusive but essential. The show’s closing acquisition ceremony becomes less social ritual and more spectacle, as ownership of a given work is not measured by monetary capacity, but by sheer will and determination. The show’s system of acquisition would seemingly decommodify the object through constant contact while at the same time activating its purpose and commodifying it though competition for its possession.Hands on an Art Body is organized by the experimental art collective HOMECOMING! based in Fort Worth, Texas.Oliver Francis Gallery is located at 209 South Peak St. in Dallas, Texas. The closing reception and participatory acquisition of work will be Saturday May 19th starting at 6 pm. Show previews will be arranged by appointment only between May 12th and May 26th.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>LADY exists to prove that we all can infuse our values into our business, workplace, and lifestyle.</strong> Our current capitalist economy convinces us that we have to compromise our values to survive. That is not true. LADY serves as a reservoir of collective consciousness, reminding us what can accomplish as female-identifying entrepreneurs: more connection, more healing, more equity. </p>
<p>LADY offers a space of exploration in anti-capitalist business practices and methods. We choose to highlight female entrepreneurs and small business owners based on their feminist approach to business models, often embodying a sense of curiosity, determination, healing, and truth. Building a platform of honesty and vulnerability, womxn are invited to share their truths, their experiences, and their resources. Through sharing, we lift one another up and make collective strides towards an abundant and equitable future. The stories and art published in LADY are invaluable to our Seattle community and to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs are brave. Carving a new path for society, means stepping away from security and comfort. LADY has been a venture in entrepreneurship and has faced these same risks. Without enough financial support from the community, we risk losing the ability to publish the zine. The published zine has proven to be an important and meaningful outlet for womxn’s stories of triumph in entrepreneurship and a catalyst for empowering a female community on and off line. </p>
<p><strong>LADY holds two core values in regard to finances:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Womxn, and especially womxn of color, must be paid fairly for their work, time, &amp; energy</strong></li>
<li><strong>LADY will remain a free and accessible resource, in the spirit of equity and community</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish both these goals, we need your support. We invite you to join us in stepping into a new paradigm of doing business.</p>

<div>Hi, I am Judith Kornett, sculptor. I live and create in the greater metro Washington DC area, My studio is in the Montpelier Arts Center, where I also teach both children and adults. I would love for you to visit my website JudithKornettArts.com to learn more about me. I have an MFA in printmaking, and have been focusing on ceramic sculpture for the last six years. I my years as a printmaker have had a tremendous influence on my ceramic work relating to my use of the human form, texture, line and color.</div>
<div>I have been  offered the opportunity of having a solo show at Clay Arts Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada. This is a dream opportunity for me, not only because it is a solo show in a venue far from where I live, but also because the venue will expose my work to an entirely new market of both artists and collectors. I am hoping this show will open many new doors of opportunity for me.</div>
<div>I am asking you to help me make this show  possible.  </div>
<div>I have estimated that I am going to need ten thousand dollars. The major expense will be truck rental: almost $6000 round trip, motels and meals during both trips. In addition I will need money for gas and tolls. Also I will need airfare home for myself and the person driving with me after the reception and then back at the end of the show to bring the work back home. And of course there is the cost of the packing materials themselves. </div>
<div>Here comes the fun part- there are wonderful and fun perks perks for donating to my campaign!                          </div>
<div>For $10  you get a big fat THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart</div>

A key area for development is for me to push boundaries within my work and expand on the areas I haven't touched on ; a larger scale, new aesthetics and completely different themes. I want to create a brand new platform for my work; to expand the viewer's perception on the stereotypical outlook on embroidery and exhibit a collection of embroidery within an exciting, unusual and eye-catching space.</span>

<h3>
<font color=""#222222"" size=""2""><span style=""""><span style=""font-weight: 300;"">I am pledging for £5,583 to buy a VW Camper van and use this as a blank canvas for the foundations of my project. Embroidery will be key theme surrounding the Camper van : steering wheel covers, curtains, pillows , gear stick covers , driving gloves and suitcases containing stereotypical holiday clothing will be displayed inside the van, detailing and exhibiting the vibrancy of my skills in hand and machine embroidery and embellishment.</span><br style=""font-weight: 300;""/><span style=""font-weight: 300;"">My adoration for my friends, music, film and travelling has led me to a colour pallet of bright blue, orange, red and gold. This finalised the theme and name of my project as Indian</span></span></font><span style=""""> Summer. </span>
</h3>
<h3><span style="""">This project is incredibly personal to me, as it is primarily showcasing my work to the world; giving my audience a truthful and poetic insight into my life and what I love through embroidery. I thrive to express myself though my work and I feel that this project will act as a significantly important aid into the success of my business.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="""">Camper van's aesthetics are predominantly related to summer, sun, holidays and general happiness and I feel these themes directly relate to myself and my work which was the first thing that I was attracted to for starting the project.</span></h3>
<h3>
<font color=""#222222"" size=""2""><span style=""""><span style=""font-weight: 300;"">Once everything is made and complete the Camper van will then act as a platform for 3 important stages within my artistic practice. It will be used as a home to showcase my work within my community, be the base for a series of images and short films, detailing my progress through social media, and finally as a mode of transport to travel to summer music festivals in 2014.</span></span></font><br style=""""/>
</h3>
<div><font color=""#222222"" size=""2""><span style=""""><span style=""font-weight: 300;"">Audiences will be constantly involved throughout the making of this project, as I want to create a strong relationship between my contributors and myself.</span></span></font></div>
<div><font size=""2""><span style="""">If a donation of £500 is made, I am promising a special reward to 4 donators. Once the project is complete, every item inside the Camper van will be a separate, finished product. I am offering my contributors to receive a bespoke embroidered piece of their choice which can be designed by them, and made by me!</span></font></div>
<div><font size=""2""><span style="""">If a donation of £100 is made, 6  contributors will each receive a handmade cushion which play an important part in the the aesthetics of the Camper van. Personalised details will be added to each cushion for each person prior to making, enabling the contributor to be a part of the project.</span></font></div>
<div><span style="""">And finally, if a donation of £50 is made, 20 contributors names will be hand embroidered intricately throughout all of the products found within the Camper van. Details of exactly where and on what product will not be unveiled until the showcase of the project : where will your name be? On a cushion? On the curtains? A quilt? Or maybe even on the Camper itself!</span></div>
<div><font size=""2""><span style=""""> Ultimately, once the project is complete, the touring of its success will begin, but if the desired amount is not met, I plan to take what is met to match funding in order for it to be completed.</span></font></div>

I want to create a brand new platform for my work; to expand the viewer's perception on the stereotypical outlook on embroidery and exhibit a collection of embroidery within an exciting, unusual and eye-catching space.


I am pledging for £5,583 to buy a VW Camper van and use this as a blank canvas for the foundations of my project. Embroidery will be key theme surrounding the Camper van : steering wheel covers, curtains, pillows , gear stick covers , driving gloves and suitcases containing stereotypical holiday clothing will be displayed inside the van, detailing and exhibiting the vibrancy of my skills in hand and machine embroidery and embellishment.My adoration for my friends, music, film and travelling has led me to a colour pallet of bright blue, orange, red and gold. This finalised the theme and name of my project as Indian Summer. 

This project is incredibly personal to me, as it is primarily showcasing my work to the world; giving my audience a truthful and poetic insight into my life and what I love through embroidery. I thrive to express myself though my work and I feel that this project will act as a significantly important aid into the success of my business.
Camper van's aesthetics are predominantly related to summer, sun, holidays and general happiness and I feel these themes directly relate to myself and my work which was the first thing that I was attracted to for starting the project.

Once everything is made and complete the Camper van will then act as a platform for 3 important stages within my artistic practice. It will be used as a home to showcase my work within my community, be the base for a series of images and short films, detailing my progress through social media, and finally as a mode of transport to travel to summer music festivals in 2014.

Audiences will be constantly involved throughout the making of this project, as I want to create a strong relationship between my contributors and myself.
If a donation of £500 is made, I am promising a special reward to 4 donators. Once the project is complete, every item inside the Camper van will be a separate, finished product. I am offering my contributors to receive a bespoke embroidered piece of their choice which can be designed by them, and made by me!
If a donation of £100 is made, 6  contributors will each receive a handmade cushion which play an important part in the the aesthetics of the Camper van. Personalised details will be added to each cushion for each person prior to making, enabling the contributor to be a part of the project.
And finally, if a donation of £50 is made, 20 contributors names will be hand embroidered intricately throughout all of the products found within the Camper van. Details of exactly where and on what product will not be unveiled until the showcase of the project : where will your name be? On a cushion? On the curtains? A quilt? Or maybe even on the Camper itself!
 Ultimately, once the project is complete, the touring of its success will begin, but if the desired amount is not met, I plan to take what is met to match funding in order for it to be completed.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

This will be a 'free' workshop, with all intent on providing a fun and creative workshop, to only heighten the festival goers experience of the entire festival.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>We are aiming to raise £500 in contribution to our own funding to allow us to make this workshop as great as possible. </li>
<li>Money raised will go toward buying the arts and crafts materials like, different coloured and decorative papers, decorations like glitters, sequins, paints, glue and string, etc, along with the appropriate tools like scissors, etc. (Remember, if we are to cater for 1000 people, then we are to provide a lot of materials!)</li>
<li>We want the workshop to be a place of peace and tranquility where people can come and relax to the sound of ancient Japanese music and fold and decorate their cranes and so we will need to fashion a sheltered area forming the workshop. Money will go into sourcing materials to make our workshop shelter which we will also decorate appropriately.</li>
<li>And of course we need to be able to transport all this over to the festival site in Cambridgeshire from Bournemouth and so the money will help fund our transportation costs.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>We (Josh and Cec) are students graduating from art school and as much as we would love to fund this project entirely by ourselves, we just don't have the money to do so.

This will be a 'free' workshop, with all intent on providing a fun and creative workshop, to only heighten the festival goers experience of the entire festival.What We Need & What You Get
We are aiming to raise £500 in contribution to our own funding to allow us to make this workshop as great as possible. 
Money raised will go toward buying the arts and crafts materials like, different coloured and decorative papers, decorations like glitters, sequins, paints, glue and string, etc, along with the appropriate tools like scissors, etc. (Remember, if we are to cater for 1000 people, then we are to provide a lot of materials!)
We want the workshop to be a place of peace and tranquility where people can come and relax to the sound of ancient Japanese music and fold and decorate their cranes and so we will need to fashion a sheltered area forming the workshop. Money will go into sourcing materials to make our workshop shelter which we will also decorate appropriately.
And of course we need to be able to transport all this over to the festival site in Cambridgeshire from Bournemouth and so the money will help fund our transportation costs.
The ImpactWe (Josh and Cec) are students graduating from art school and as much as we would love to fund this project entirely by ourselves, we just don't have the money to do so. As a contributor you will be making this project possible, providing all who take part a moment of peace and calm, and a chance to express their arts and crafty side, ultimately heightening their festival experience.

<p>The vision for Build The Tip came from two die-hard Seahawks fans who believe Richard Sherman’s tipped pass to Malcolm Smith to win the NFC Championship was a moment so pivotal, awe-inspiring, and emblematic of everything great about the 2013 Seattle Seahawks team, that it should be immortalized for future generations of Seahawks fans to enjoy. The play will be captured in a magnificent bronze sculpture designed and built by local artist <a href=""http://soulinbronze.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Pettelle</a>. The sculpture will pay tribute to the entire Super Bowl XLVIII championship team by incorporating every 2013 Seahawk player.</p>
<p>Build The Tip is in discussions with the Seattle Seahawks organization, Seattle city officials, and various local property owners to choose a location for the sculpture next to CenturyLink Field which will allows fans to enjoy and interact with The Tip on their way into home games.</p>
<p>Every dollar raised in the Build The Tip campaign above the cost of the project will be donated to charity.</p>

<p></p>
<h4>Where will The Tip be located?</h4>
<p>Our goal is to place The Tip in a location near CenturyLink Field that enables fans to enjoy and interact with the sculpture on their way into Seahawks home games.  We are looking at several potential sites and will announce the official location in an update as soon as possible.   Our vision looks like this:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796746/files/20140818181311-The_Tip_at_CenturyLink_Field_3__Large.jpg?1408410791"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Do the Seattle Seahawks support this project?</h4>
<p>We are in discussions with the Seahawks organization about Build The Tip.  They are aware of the project and applaud the passion and spirit of the 12s, even while they remain focused on the upcoming football season.</p>
<h4>How long will it take to finish The Tip?</h4>
<div>It will take approximately one year to complete The Tip.  Our goal is to have an unveiling of The Tip at the start of the 2015 NFL season.</div>
<h4>Why does it cost this much to Build The Tip?<br/>
</h4>
<div>Our $250,000 budget breaks down as follows:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>$165,000   Sculpture design, prototypes, foundry, delivery &amp; installation<br/>
</li>
<li>$45,000     Prizes for campaign donors (note: a variable cost, can rise or fall)<br/>
</li>
<li>$35,000     Fees to Indiegogo and payment processors (note: a variable cost, can rise or fall)<br/>
</li>
<li>$5,000        Sculpture maintenance fund and project buffer<br/>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p></p>
<h4>If you raise surplus funds, where will they go?</h4>

Build The Tip is a crowdfunding project by 12s and for 12s to create a lasting work of art that pays tribute to our beloved Seattle Seahawks and their amazing 2013 Super Bowl Championship season.
The vision for Build The Tip came from two die-hard Seahawks fans who believe Richard Sherman’s tipped pass to Malcolm Smith to win the NFC Championship was a moment so pivotal, awe-inspiring, and emblematic of everything great about the 2013 Seattle Seahawks team, that it should be immortalized for future generations of Seahawks fans to enjoy. The play will be captured in a magnificent bronze sculpture designed and built by local artist Kevin Pettelle. The sculpture will pay tribute to the entire Super Bowl XLVIII championship team by incorporating every 2013 Seahawk player.
Build The Tip is in discussions with the Seattle Seahawks organization, Seattle city officials, and various local property owners to choose a location for the sculpture next to CenturyLink Field which will allows fans to enjoy and interact with The Tip on their way into home games.
Every dollar raised in the Build The Tip campaign above the cost of the project will be donated to charity.
plaque of 48

We will place a plaque on The Tip called the Plaque of 48, celebrating the people who made it possible to Build The Tip. This Plaque of 48 will feature four columns of 12 names. 
Donate at least $12 today and YOU are eligible to win YOUR NAME on the Plaque of 48!

frequently asked questions

Where will The Tip be located?
Our goal is to place The Tip in a location near CenturyLink Field that enables fans to enjoy and interact with the sculpture on their way into Seahawks home games.  We are looking at several potential sites and will announce the official location in an update as soon as possible.   Our vision looks like this:
Do the Seattle Seahawks support this project?
We are in discussions with the Seahawks organization about Build The Tip.  They are aware of the project and applaud the passion and spirit of the 12s, even while they remain focused on the upcoming football season.
How long will it take to finish The Tip?
It will take approximately one year to complete The Tip.  Our goal is to have an unveiling of The Tip at the start of the 2015 NFL season.
Why does it cost this much to Build The Tip?

Our $250,000 budget breaks down as follows:

$165,000   Sculpture design, prototypes, foundry, delivery & installation

$45,000     Prizes for campaign donors (note: a variable cost, can rise or fall)

$35,000     Fees to Indiegogo and payment processors (note: a variable cost, can rise or fall)

$5,000        Sculpture maintenance fund and project buffer



If you raise surplus funds, where will they go?
All funds raised in this campaign above the cost of the project will be donated to charity.  We look forward to hearing feedback from donors on which charities should benefit.
Why focus on this particular play over other great 2013 moments?
The Tip commemorates this glorious play because it was such a pivotal and memorable moment we all got to see and enjoy at home, because it sent us to Super Bowl XLVIII, and because it so beautifully represents the team's relentless determination and drive.  We intend for The Tip to celebrate the success and greatness of the entire 2013 Seattle Seahawks team.  The sculpture will include and represent all members of the championship Seahawks team.  And it will pay tribute to the 12s who have kept the faith for 38 seasons, raising their voices and believing in the team they love.
What other work has sculptor Kevin Pettelle done?
Kevin Pettelle is one of the most talented sculptors in Seattle and his work can be found across the Pacific Northwest.  See his website Soul in Bronze for more information.
How can I reach the organizers of Build The Tip with questions or feedback?  What if I want to become a corporate sponsor?
Send any questions or feedback to info@buildthetip.com, joe@buildthetip.com or chris@buildthetip.com. 

What if you don't raise all of the $250,000?  What will you do with the money you do raise?
We plan to use whatever money we raise to begin creating the sculpture.  Other art projects we researched which did not initially raise their entire goal used the funds to begin the sculpture process, which enabled them to raise the remainder of the funding through corporate sponsors.  We intend to do what it takes to complete a world-class work of art and deliver it to the 12s.

<p>
Blind Reproduction is a collaborative art and writing project between 13 artists, 13 writers, and one curator.  Sometimes we like to call it Exquisite Poop, combining the names of two less elaborate surrealist party games: Exquisite Corpse and Eat Poop You Cat (the paper game), both of which play with hidden imagery.  The artists were invited to contribute one of their smaller two dimensional works, and promise to make another.  Images, titles, size and media information were then assigned to the writers, who were charged with describing the art as thoroughly and sincerely as possible, as if the work had been destroyed and needed to be remade, or as if it were being forged.  Then, these descriptions were randomly assigned to the contributing artists, with a little tweaking to prevent artists reproducing their own work or that of someone working in media alien to them.  The artists were tasked with recreating the artwork they thought the writer had described, without knowing the artist or seeing the original image.</p>
<p>
The first stage of translation from visual to verbal varies hugely in style and focus, even given stylistic restrictions.  Several different writing strategies were tried, each likely to be misinterpreted wildly depending on the artist.  The artist's job is even harder and even more subject to the variations of personality and style.  The resulting illustration of mis/communication varies from wondrous to farcical to tragic.</p><p><br/></p>

</p><p><br/></p>
<p>Janet was inspired to do this project when she took blind gallery owner and retired professor Steve Cannon to art shows and tried to describe the art to him.  She found that even conceptual work relied on an attentive visuality sorely lacking from a great deal of art writing.  Not only that, but she decided that the spirit of absurd experimentation and attempt toward the art director's rare skill by a wide variety of creators would be worth building a show around.  If all goes well, the 13 original pieces and the 13 reproductions, as well as the descriptions, will be shown March 10 - April 14, 2012 at Steve Cannon's space <a href=""http://www.tribes.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Gathering of the Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, we invite you to support our efforts to pay Mr. Cannon's rent and exhibition costs as well as giving very hard-working artists and writers their fair due.  We'll also need to make and print a small catalog, and are offering affordable prints of each set of two visuals and a verbal: original, description, and reproduction.  You can even get in early on buying a before and after pair of artworks, ready to hang with the description linking them.  We'll even let you commission more work, in the form of either a description of the artwork of your choice, a small artwork based on a description you give, or another full iteration of one of the sets, all three artworks you then own.  Pledge early to get your name in the catalog as a supporter in larger and larger font sizes depending on your contribution, as well as updates including the descriptions, images, and discussion of the process with the artists and writers.  Tell everyone you know, and maybe this can become a series, with new writers and artists.</p></div>","Blind Reproduction

<p>You can make it happen! - a unique publication that goes beyond traditional forms of paper and digital media.<br/><br/>By supporting Zwykła Maps you help ingenious but little known artists from all the corners of the world.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3825/9413532637_98872a5bc1_o_d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-top: 40px;"">Idea</h3>
<p>Zwykła Maps (<a href=""http://zwykla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">zwykla.com</a>) is an initiative seeking formal choices that merge the need for knowledge and experience with expectations a contemporary man has toward traditional paper publications. The initiative aims at creating a form that draws on the potential of digital media. This potential enables low-budget creators to find an increasingly wider audience for their works and contribute to developing collective ideas not limited by space or scope. Our aim becomes a reality as two concepts of albums. The first one is a paper, large-format publication resembling a folding map. The other one is a digital album designed specifically for mobile devices and readers (such as tablets or ultrabooks), which have created a new segment in the publishing market. The idea of a digital album is based on a conscious and reasonable utilization of modern technology, which removes the limits of plain text and still images. Such innovative solutions include the simultaneous use of sound and animation, as well as the ability to refer to external sources instantly through the worldwide web.<br/>However, the two concepts presented above are merely indirect elements of a much larger objective, as our main intention is to facilitate creation and publishing of original works that use diverse forms of content distribution. Content that is highly unusual, we should add, as it escapes defining through our everyday means of communication – our mouths.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-top: 40px;"">Financing</h3>
<p>The budget of a project consists of donations (75%) and own contribution (25%).
Zwykła Maps’ idea is to create a publications which will fund another publications.

<li>Zine “countenance” – it’s an open form of publication in which you can also have a chance to present your own works related to the subject: a countenance in hands and face. The idea just like the famous exhibition “The Family of Man” (1955) expresses something simple and universal at the same time. Something that is easier to show with an image and emotions rather than with words.

<p>L’initiative de Zwykła Maps (<a href=""http://zwykla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">zwykla.com</a>) recherche des solutions formelles qui unissent la necessité des connaissances et des expériences aux attentes misent dans une publication traditionnelle papier. Le principe de l’entreprise est de créer une position éditrice qui fait appel au potentiel des médias digitaux. Grâce a ce potentiel, les créateurs sans fortune tirent profit de plus en plus souvent de la possibilité de partager leurs travaux et co-participer dans le développement des idées colléctives et illimitées. La réalisation de ces principes est accomplie a travers deux conception albumique. La premiere forme est une publication papier qui fait référence aux conventions de la carte, donc c’est un tirage a grande échelle pliés en plusieurs parties. La deuxieme est un album virtuel projeté pour lecteurs digitaux et portatifs (pe. tablet, ipad, ultrabook), qui forment une nouvelle niche dans le marché des livres. La principe de l’album est un faire-valoir raisonable et conscient des solutions téchnologiques innovantes qui dépassent les limites du texte et de l’image statique en présentant l’animation et le son de maniere simultannée ou en se référant aux matériaux accessibles dans la toile globale qui fonctionnent au dehors de la publication.<br/><br/>Les solutions formelles mentionnées auparavant constituent seulement un élément intermediaire par rapport aux principaux objectifs de l’entreprise. L’initiative de la maison d’édition est donc une aide a la création et a la distribution des publications d’auteurs qui mettent a profit d’une maniere différente la transmission du contenu. Cependent, c’est un contenu exeptionnel car il est difficile ou impossible a identifier en utilisant un appareil de la langue normal, utilisé quotidiennement.</p>

<p>La editorial Zwykła Maps (<a href=""http://zwykla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">zwykla.com</a>) es una iniciativa que apuesta por unas soluciones formales que unen la necesidad del conocimiento y de la experiencia con las espectativas que hombre contemporáneo tiene en respecto a la publicación tradicional en papel. La idea que promueve la creación de la editorial es parovechar el potencial de las técnicas digitales. Gracias a ese potencial los creadores indigentes empiezan a aprovechar cada vez más de la posibilidad de compartir sus propios trabajos o de coexistir en el desarrollo de las ideas colectivas e ilimitadas. La realisación de estas suposiciones se realiza a través de dos conceptos de álbumes. El primer concepto se basa en la publicación en papel que hace referencia al formato de un mapa. Se trata pues de un impreso en tamano grande redoblado en partes. El segundo – en un albúm disenado para los lectores digitales y portátiles (pe. tablet, ipad, ultrabook) que forman un nuevo nicho en el mercado de libros. El supuesto de este albúm es de aprovechar de una manera razonable y consciente de las innovadoras soluciones técnicas que no se basan solamente en el texto y la imágen estática, sino también en la presentación simultánea de animación y sonido o en la posibilidad de las referencias inmediatas a los materiales que funcionan fuera de la publicación, pero están disponibles en la red.<br/><br/>No obstante, las presentadas soluciones formales constituyen solamente un elemento intermedio ante los principos objetivos de la iniciativa. La intencia del editorial es pues la ayuda en la creación y distribución de las publicaciones de autores que aprovechan de diferentes formas para transmitir contenido.

Idea
Zwykła Maps (zwykla.com) is an initiative seeking formal choices that merge the need for knowledge and experience with expectations a contemporary man has toward traditional paper publications. The initiative aims at creating a form that draws on the potential of digital media. This potential enables low-budget creators to find an increasingly wider audience for their works and contribute to developing collective ideas not limited by space or scope. Our aim becomes a reality as two concepts of albums. The first one is a paper, large-format publication resembling a folding map. The other one is a digital album designed specifically for mobile devices and readers (such as tablets or ultrabooks), which have created a new segment in the publishing market. The idea of a digital album is based on a conscious and reasonable utilization of modern technology, which removes the limits of plain text and still images. Such innovative solutions include the simultaneous use of sound and animation, as well as the ability to refer to external sources instantly through the worldwide web.However, the two concepts presented above are merely indirect elements of a much larger objective, as our main intention is to facilitate creation and publishing of original works that use diverse forms of content distribution. Content that is highly unusual, we should add, as it escapes defining through our everyday means of communication – our mouths.
(example of B1 size poster-map)
Financing
The budget of a project consists of donations (75%) and own contribution (25%).
Zwykła Maps’ idea is to create a publications which will fund another publications.

What we need the money for:

printing and distribution of first two maps
a folding machine
color samplers
a tablet for testing purposes (testing digital publications, e.g. for the impact attached videos may have on the device’s performance)
fees (PayPal, indiegoo, payment cards), currency conversions, etc.

Broke but still want to help?
Share and publish on your website one of the promotional images! Don’t forget to attach a link to indegoo or directly to zwykla.com
Delivery costs
Perk prices include delivery costs.
First maps:

Zine “countenance” – it’s an open form of publication in which you can also have a chance to present your own works related to the subject: a countenance in hands and face. The idea just like the famous exhibition “The Family of Man” (1955) expresses something simple and universal at the same time. Something that is easier to show with an image and emotions rather than with words. Look what’s interesting for us: cotce.tumblr.com , flickr.com/groups/1622167@N21 and send us your Works!

Grâce a toi, ce sera possible de créer une maison d’édition qui dépassera toutes les limites de formes de publication en papier ou en digital.

En secourant Zwykla Maps, tu aide les créateurs geniaux mais peu connu ou meme totalement inconnus de différents coins du monde.
Idée
L’initiative de Zwykła Maps (zwykla.com) recherche des solutions formelles qui unissent la necessité des connaissances et des expériences aux attentes misent dans une publication traditionnelle papier. Le principe de l’entreprise est de créer une position éditrice qui fait appel au potentiel des médias digitaux. Grâce a ce potentiel, les créateurs sans fortune tirent profit de plus en plus souvent de la possibilité de partager leurs travaux et co-participer dans le développement des idées colléctives et illimitées. La réalisation de ces principes est accomplie a travers deux conception albumique. La premiere forme est une publication papier qui fait référence aux conventions de la carte, donc c’est un tirage a grande échelle pliés en plusieurs parties. La deuxieme est un album virtuel projeté pour lecteurs digitaux et portatifs (pe. tablet, ipad, ultrabook), qui forment une nouvelle niche dans le marché des livres. La principe de l’album est un faire-valoir raisonable et conscient des solutions téchnologiques innovantes qui dépassent les limites du texte et de l’image statique en présentant l’animation et le son de maniere simultannée ou en se référant aux matériaux accessibles dans la toile globale qui fonctionnent au dehors de la publication.Les solutions formelles mentionnées auparavant constituent seulement un élément intermediaire par rapport aux principaux objectifs de l’entreprise. L’initiative de la maison d’édition est donc une aide a la création et a la distribution des publications d’auteurs qui mettent a profit d’une maniere différente la transmission du contenu. Cependent, c’est un contenu exeptionnel car il est difficile ou impossible a identifier en utilisant un appareil de la langue normal, utilisé quotidiennement.
Financement
Le quart des ressources vient de propre fonds. Le reste viendra de dons.
L’idée es que les premiers publicacions financent les autres.
A quoi on réservera l’argent ?

a imprimer et envoyer deux premieres cartes,
a une machine pour plier le papier (une folioteuse),
aux modeles de couleurs,
a tablet pour tester des publications digitales (pe. pour vérifier si une vidéo mise en publication ne charge pas trop un appareil)
a payer l’ingiegogo, payapl / cartes de crédit, convertions de monnaie, etc.

Vous n’avez pas de ressources mais vous voudriez nous aider ?
Vous pouvez également copier une des images de promotion et rendez-le accesible sur votre page d’Internet avec l’adresse d’indiegogo ou directament de zwykla.com
Envoi
Les frais d'envois sont inclut dans une somme de suppléments.
Premieres cartes:

Zine « countenance » est une forme ouverte de publication en laquelle toi aussi tu as une chance de présenter ces travaux liés au theme : l'expression des mains et du visage. L’idée, comme une exposition tres connue « The Family of Man » (1955), donne quelque chose de simple et d' universel. Quelque chose qui est plus facile a montrer a travers des images et des émotions qu'a travers des mots. Voyez ce qui est intéressant pour nous : cotce.tumblr.com , flickr.com/groups/1622167@N21 et envoyez-nous votre travaux !

</p><p>I am about to begin a training program with Shiloh Sophia
McCloud called ""The Color of Women"". 
The purpose of the training is for me to learn Shiloh's
method of Intentional Creativity and then be able to go into my community and
teach workshops based on her method but with my own themes and content.  Intentional Creativity is about helping each
person to take a transformational journey into their own creativity. The process starts with an inner journey, a
meditation, to connect to you inner self. 
Questions are asked of the self and journaling begins.  Sketches put the symbols and ideas onto
paper.  The painting process then begins
and the image given in the journey begin to take form.</p>
<p>In Shiloh's
own words:</p>
<p>""The Color of Woman
Method 13 Step Painting process is at the heart of our work which is a method
of painting that allows for anyone to create a painting. The process leads you
on a journey through your own soul story and layer by layer reveals insight and
healing. It isn’t based on skill, because it draws from within instead of
referencing external images. The <i>Color of Woman</i> Training is designed to
connect you with what truly lights you up and activates you towards creating a
life that expresses your innermost longing and desires. This training is
designed to give you access to … you!<br/>
To show you <i>how</i> to find and express your own information.</p>
<p>I have already completed on painting myself using Shiloh's
method and can confirm the power of the process.<span>  I had an unexpected and powerful
experience.  In the next 6 months I will
be continuing this journey as I undertake the training.</span></p>
<p>I feel very strongly that art can be used to heal. I
began making art using clay over 15 years ago when I was in my late 30's. I had
not been encouraged to be an artist when I<span> 
was younger. I became so passionate about art that I returned to college
and earned a BFA and an MFA in ceramics as an older student..  My intention was to become a college
professor and professional artist.  After
graduating and beginning teaching at local colleges, I have found that something is still
missing.  My spiritual life and my
teaching life seemed disconnected.  I was
searching for an answer that would allow me to make art and also help others
discover and connect to their own creativity, especially people who do not feel
that they are creative.  I was led  by Spirit to Shiloh Sophia McCloud this past
fall.  I knew instantly that what Shiloh was teaching was what I was looking for. Her training gives me a framework to use to
help others tap into their innate creativity and transform and heal their
lives. I am about to begin her Color of
Women training this spring.  I am anxious
to bring this to the women in my community and have plans to hold workshops for
women of all ages.  This method can be
used to facilitate healing and it lends itself to many themes.  I am
hoping to work with women who have been abused and women who have had breast
cancer. Our planet and the people on it
need so much healing at this point in time and I believe very strongly in the
use of art to accomplish this. The training is expensive so I am asking for
help to cover the tuition and materials. 
I am hoping to raise $6000 to
cover the bulk of the training. I would
appreciate any help that you are able to give. I am offering some of my ceramic
art as gifts if you donate and I am also offering a chance to pre-book
workshops at a reduced price if you live near me in the Lawrence,
KS or Kansas
  City area. It
would also be a big help if you could spread the word about my campaign to your

She 		continued to study photography, first at Vancouver’s Emily Carr 		Institute of Art and Design and then the graduate program at the San 		Francisco Institute of Art and Design where she received her Master of Fine Arts Degree. She has had 15 solo art 		exhibitions and has been included in over 20 international group shows. </li></ul><ul><li>
<p></p>
<p>While working free lance in London UK,
Maria developed a friendship with a London-based Dominatrix, as she got to know
her better she realized this woman was in a very unique position of power
within this subculture community. This was in line with her continuing
investigation of societies’ layered interpretations versus self-expression of
feminine identities; the idea of the book was born. Maria realized that to make
this a strong social document she would need to look at this profession from a
global perspective.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maria
undertook the task and overcame the challenges to gather the material necessary
to create this unique visual social document. After five years of planning 13 worldwide
interviews and photo shoots, she was ready to create the book. After a year of hard
work designing, editing and laying out the book, she was ready to publish. After months of frustration approaching publishers, Maria reached an agreement with a Toronto publisher who would handle the distribution and she would finance the printing.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p></p>
<p>Maria met some of the world’s most
prominent Dominas, and gained access to areas of their lives very few see. For
the reader these women open themselves to talk about their emotional lives
which accompany the profession of Domination. This book is a testimony to not
only Maria's ability as an artist but also to her warm personality to draw out
her subjects from their otherwise hidden dungeons in such cities as London,
Paris, Tokyo, Sydney and Las Vegas. It is a strong and unique visual social
document of contemporary attitudes towards sexuality.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a fifteen year old homeschooled girl and I've been <a href=""http://paradoxesarefailing.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""new"">running my own business in traditional art mediums</a> for the past two years (or so), have had several commissions, and have been to several local art events. I love creating. Painting, drawing, writing, photography... However, I'm only able to take pictures with my phone camera, and while it's still something, I can't pursue the artform fully without an actual camera.</p>
<p>I've always, always loved photography, but never had the funds to pursue it. Ever since I was little, I've loved taking pictures of my cats, architecture, and especially the outdoors. Recently I've been very burned out on creating something on paper or canvas, and I can't bring myself to create there, but as usual, I can spend hours snapping away pictures from my phone.</p>
<p>Photography is a dream of mine, something I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and have always admired, but the funds were just never there. It would be absolutely amazing to make this happen. <span>♥</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm setting the funding goal at $700, so it covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nikon D3100 Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm VR lens</li>
<li>Memory card for the camera</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4, for editing</li>
<li>5 Reflector Discs for lighting effect</li>
<li>IndieGoGo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach the $700 goal by the time this ends, I'll buy what I can, and then work my way up to getting the other items. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Like I stated in the Summary above, I've always loved photography and have always held a high admiration for it. I love expressing creativity, and in my paintings I enjoy expressing emotion and often darker meanings. Photography would enable me to do just that, only better. I want to bring out a deeper level of emotion combined with a sense of dream-like cloudiness, surrealism, and wonder. Over the last few years, I've kept thinking of concepts for several series of art, that I would only be able to capture behind a camera, and I would finally be able to bring that dream into reality.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone can donate money, but even a share to your favourite social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter would be greatly appreciated. Every little bit helps. ♥</p>

To-date, Can Can Wonderland has a population of 71 collaborators, and we are

</div>
<p>Can Can Wonderland is a mini golf course.  We didn’t design it though.  We asked the mini golf enthusiasts of the
world to do that.  We sent out a call for
artists asking “What is the mini golf hole you have always wanted to play?” We
received over 200 proposals from all over the country and as far away as
Australia. A jury of talented architects, visual artists, fabricators, and electrical engineers helped us select the 18 mini golf holes to be built for our course, and we
believe they are spectacular!</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But Can Can Wonderland isn’t just </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">mini golf</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">; it’s a wonderland full of
arts-based fauna and flora for you to explore and delight in! Our boardwalk is
full of attractions and amusements (created by/with artists). Our two stages offer a wide array of local
and regional talents.  We have beer. We
have noshes! We even have a few unicorns. <br/></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432649642/bw6xk2kgyypn26t1u7jh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>

<i>“I’m sick of following my dreams. I’m just going to ask them where they’re going and hook up with them later. “  - Mitch Hedberg</i><br/><br/><h2><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We have been dreaming about mini golf for ages, and
we have a big vision for this project. We are creating an arts-immersive environment that includes mini golf, a boardwalk of amusements, two stages, a restaurant, bar, and a cafe and old fashioned soda fountain.</p>
<p>Of course, this project needs money to get off the ground, and
crowdfunding is a nice way to help do that, but to us, the most important part of
crowdfunding is the <i>crowd</i> part.  What’s worth more than money?  Energy! 
People believing in the project. 
People wanting to help see it through. 
Can Can Wonderland needs the love and support of the community to make
the engine turn over. A contribution in <i>ANY</i>
amount is the vote of confidence that we need. 
The dollars are gas in the tank. </p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise $40,000 from
the community. The monies raised here are ear marked for two purposes: to
complete the mini golf course and build the boardwalk of amusements. Stay tuned and we will be releasing a new video in the coming weeks so you can get to know our artists!<br/></p>

<h2>THE IMPACT<br/>
</h2> <p></p>
<p>The Twin Cities is a diverse region, yet most places are
mono-culture. Studies show that diverse audiences come together for fun,
recreational activities, for unique experiences. We aim to create an
arts-immersive place that has something for everyone. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We are using a new business
model. Because we are for profit we will be consumer-driven to survive. What
attracts people? Fun! But we don't want this to be cookie-cutter. We want the
scrappiness, edginess, whimsy, joy, imagination, vision to create something
that would be difficult to replicate, that is uniquely an arts place in St.
Paul, that will become a national treasure.</p>
<p>We became one of the first <a href=""http://www.twincities.com/business/ci_27245121/minnesota-businesses-start-year-new-socially-minded-registration"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">public benefit corporations</a> in Minnesota because we have specific values that we want to support. To be an
economic engine for the arts means that we will build new audiences for the
arts and provide ongoing paid opportunities for artists. We are also exploring ways
to expand those paid opportunities through profit sharing. Treating artists
well also translates to treating our employees well - not every employee will
start out at a living wage initially, but they will all start out above minimum
wage, and it is our goal to move all employees into a living wage. <br/></p>

<p></p></div>","WHO WE ARE
Can Can Wonderland founders are Christi Atkinson, Rob
Clapp, Chris Pennington, and Jennifer Pennington.  We are the people behind such seminal Twin
Cities art projects as Walker Artist Designed Mini golf, the Ten Second Film Festival and Soap Factory’s Haunted Basement. 
But we would not be Can Can Wonderland without the artists, fabricators
and professionals that are joining together to create this unique arts destination.
To-date, Can Can Wonderland has a population of 71 collaborators, and we are
growing every day.

(our rockstar founders pictured above; below is a gathering of some of our artist collaborators presenting their mini golf holes!)



WHAT IS CAN CAN WONDERLAND? 



Can Can Wonderland is a mini golf course.  We didn’t design it though.  We asked the mini golf enthusiasts of the
world to do that.  We sent out a call for
artists asking “What is the mini golf hole you have always wanted to play?” We
received over 200 proposals from all over the country and as far away as
Australia. A jury of talented architects, visual artists, fabricators, and electrical engineers helped us select the 18 mini golf holes to be built for our course, and we
believe they are spectacular!But Can Can Wonderland isn’t just mini golf; it’s a wonderland full of
arts-based fauna and flora for you to explore and delight in! Our boardwalk is
full of attractions and amusements (created by/with artists). Our two stages offer a wide array of local
and regional talents.  We have beer. We
have noshes! We even have a few unicorns. 

BUILDING A NATIONAL TREASURE AIN'T CHEAP!
“I’m sick of following my dreams. I’m just going to ask them where they’re going and hook up with them later. “  - Mitch HedbergWHAT WE NEED

We have been dreaming about mini golf for ages, and
we have a big vision for this project. We are creating an arts-immersive environment that includes mini golf, a boardwalk of amusements, two stages, a restaurant, bar, and a cafe and old fashioned soda fountain.
Of course, this project needs money to get off the ground, and
crowdfunding is a nice way to help do that, but to us, the most important part of
crowdfunding is the crowd part.  What’s worth more than money?  Energy! 
People believing in the project. 
People wanting to help see it through. 
Can Can Wonderland needs the love and support of the community to make
the engine turn over. A contribution in ANY
amount is the vote of confidence that we need. 
The dollars are gas in the tank. 
Our goal for this campaign is to raise $40,000 from
the community. The monies raised here are ear marked for two purposes: to
complete the mini golf course and build the boardwalk of amusements. Stay tuned and we will be releasing a new video in the coming weeks so you can get to know our artists!






THE IMPACT
 
The Twin Cities is a diverse region, yet most places are
mono-culture. Studies show that diverse audiences come together for fun,
recreational activities, for unique experiences. We aim to create an
arts-immersive place that has something for everyone. 

We are using a new business
model. Because we are for profit we will be consumer-driven to survive. What
attracts people? Fun! But we don't want this to be cookie-cutter. We want the
scrappiness, edginess, whimsy, joy, imagination, vision to create something
that would be difficult to replicate, that is uniquely an arts place in St.
Paul, that will become a national treasure.
We became one of the first public benefit corporations in Minnesota because we have specific values that we want to support. To be an
economic engine for the arts means that we will build new audiences for the
arts and provide ongoing paid opportunities for artists. We are also exploring ways
to expand those paid opportunities through profit sharing. Treating artists
well also translates to treating our employees well - not every employee will
start out at a living wage initially, but they will all start out above minimum
wage, and it is our goal to move all employees into a living wage.

We have a shared ambition and love of
art. We held our first show ‘Unknown &amp; Unseen’ in January 2015 featuring 12
emerging artists and we were amazed and inspired by its success. More than 100
people attended the opening and the gallery received unexpectedly high numbers
of visitors.
<p><a href=""http://thewaitingroom.org.uk/UnknownUnseen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thewaitingroom.org.uk/UnknownUnseen</a></p>
<p>Impressed with the
success of the exhibition, our dedication and innovation, we have been asked
for a second time to organise an exhibition in the space before it is gutted
and made into flats. </p>
<p>Invigorated by our
achievements, we want to curate another exhibition that is bigger, bolder and
more ambitious than the last. This time we want large-scale
works and a united theme. We want to give more artists the opportunity to
showcase their talents. </p>
<p>Praise for 'The Unknown &amp; Unseen':</p>
<p><i>'The Unknown &amp; Unseen'
was a profoundly clever exhibition, willing to break the boundaries between
different artistic disciplines. It played with form, function and the
unique space it was housed in – an old diamond warehouse – to ask
questions of what we take for granted when we engage with the world.'</i><br/></p>

<p>Having built on what we’ve learnt from
the first exhibition we are confident that your funding will allow us to take this
project from an amateur pop-up to a professionally run operation. </p>
<p>Without your funding, we simply cannot
afford to do everything we want to do to ensure that this complex exhibition is
as successful, innovative and explosive as we have conceived it to be.</p>
<p>Fortunate as we are to have the exhibition
in a space spanning two floors, which gives us the freedom to display
large-scale works (some of which are more than 4 meters in length) this comes
with a unique set of challenges. </p>
<p>Not wanting to jeopardise the quality
of the works in the exhibition or limit the artists we are hosting means that our
insurance premium is much higher than for our last exhibition. It is very
important to us that the space is protected and that the artists feel
comfortable that their works are safe.</p>
<p>Your funding would also help us pay
for basic but essential items to allow the exhibition’s installation to run
smoothly. This includes the transportation of the artwork, materials for
the install and de-install, drinks for the opening and expenses for the volunteers who are an
essential component in ensuring the space is secure.</p>
<p>Any donation towards this project will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who we are:</b></p>
<p>Ben and Wilhemina represent two sides
of the art industry. Ben, a recent photography graduate from Manchester School
of Art has helped realise four pop-up projects in the space of 4 months (also
at 84 Hatton Garden) for roving independent curator, Marcelle Joseph. Having
witnessed the practical necessities of curating an exhibition Ben was invited by the owner of 84
Hatton Garden, Steven Saleh to curate his own exhibition. 
</p><p>Wilhemina has extensive knowledge in
gallery, editorial and press relation systems having previously interned for arts
focused firm Sutton PR and The Serpentine gallery among others. After she
graduated from UCL with a BSc in Anthropology, Wilhemina continued her studies
at The Courtauld Institute of Art undertaking an MA in Contemporary Chinese
Art, shortly after which she started as an archivist at Michael Werner gallery
in London.</p>
<p>Ben and Wilhemina began working
together in December 2014 keen to build on their shared ethos: to give artists from
a wide range of professional and educational backgrounds, a platform to fulfil
their vision. The duo avidly support artists who are not represented by a
gallery – giving them a place at the table to articulate their concepts and
proposals.</p>

<br/></div>","As emerging curators, we (Benjamin
Copping and Wilhemina Madeley) need your help to realise an ambitious and
innovative exhibition set in a disused diamond warehouse at 84 Hatton Garden in
London.
http://thewaitingroom.org.uk/About-Us
About the exhibition:
The exhibition, entitled ‘Dimension(s)
Variable’ (April 24th – May 15th) focuses on one of the
most hotly contested, debated and controversial topics in contemporary art: the
explosion and prominence of the internet and the advancement of affordable
consumer technology. 
With a vast list of established and
emerging artists we are keen to do this
project justice, allowing it to reach its full potential. 
The exhibitors are: 
Catherine
Hughes (Bloomberg New Contemporaries 2013)
HaYoung Kim (Emerging Artists Program, Seoul Museum of Art 2014)
Natasha Peel (New Sensations 2012)
Michael
Pybus (upcoming solo exhibition at Evelyn Yard, London) Antonio Marguet (Catlin Art Guide 2012)
Rebecca
Scheinberg (Catlin Art Guide 2015)
Paul Schneider (Catlin Art
Guide 2015)
Verity Birt (commissioned
sculpture by Somerset House 2016) 
Goro Shimano (designer of
Special Olympics Fukoka 2014 poster)
Ebae (upcoming
residency at The Composing Rooms, Berlin)
Bruce Ingram (Arts
Council England Individual artist’s award 2004 & 2009)
James
Jessiman (part of Friday Late exhibition at V&A 2013)
HaYoung Kim, 'CCTV 1', 2014Catherine Hughes, 'Into the Fold; Range Rover Autobiography Black 40th Anniversary Limited Edition', 2012Antonio Marguet, 'Remote Crocodile Tears' 2012-2013Verity Birt, 'Common Era II', 2015Install shots:Why us?
We have a shared ambition and love of
art. We held our first show ‘Unknown & Unseen’ in January 2015 featuring 12
emerging artists and we were amazed and inspired by its success. More than 100
people attended the opening and the gallery received unexpectedly high numbers
of visitors.
http://thewaitingroom.org.uk/UnknownUnseen
Impressed with the
success of the exhibition, our dedication and innovation, we have been asked
for a second time to organise an exhibition in the space before it is gutted
and made into flats. 
Invigorated by our
achievements, we want to curate another exhibition that is bigger, bolder and
more ambitious than the last. This time we want large-scale
works and a united theme. We want to give more artists the opportunity to
showcase their talents. 
Praise for 'The Unknown & Unseen':
'The Unknown & Unseen'
was a profoundly clever exhibition, willing to break the boundaries between
different artistic disciplines. It played with form, function and the
unique space it was housed in – an old diamond warehouse – to ask
questions of what we take for granted when we engage with the world.'
-Felix Danczak 
The Unknown & Unseen install shots:Why we need you:
Having built on what we’ve learnt from
the first exhibition we are confident that your funding will allow us to take this
project from an amateur pop-up to a professionally run operation. 
Without your funding, we simply cannot
afford to do everything we want to do to ensure that this complex exhibition is
as successful, innovative and explosive as we have conceived it to be.
Fortunate as we are to have the exhibition
in a space spanning two floors, which gives us the freedom to display
large-scale works (some of which are more than 4 meters in length) this comes
with a unique set of challenges. 
Not wanting to jeopardise the quality
of the works in the exhibition or limit the artists we are hosting means that our
insurance premium is much higher than for our last exhibition. It is very
important to us that the space is protected and that the artists feel
comfortable that their works are safe.
Your funding would also help us pay
for basic but essential items to allow the exhibition’s installation to run
smoothly. This includes the transportation of the artwork, materials for
the install and de-install, drinks for the opening and expenses for the volunteers who are an
essential component in ensuring the space is secure.
Any donation towards this project will be greatly appreciated.
Who we are:
Ben and Wilhemina represent two sides
of the art industry. Ben, a recent photography graduate from Manchester School
of Art has helped realise four pop-up projects in the space of 4 months (also
at 84 Hatton Garden) for roving independent curator, Marcelle Joseph. Having
witnessed the practical necessities of curating an exhibition Ben was invited by the owner of 84
Hatton Garden, Steven Saleh to curate his own exhibition. 
Wilhemina has extensive knowledge in
gallery, editorial and press relation systems having previously interned for arts
focused firm Sutton PR and The Serpentine gallery among others. After she
graduated from UCL with a BSc in Anthropology, Wilhemina continued her studies
at The Courtauld Institute of Art undertaking an MA in Contemporary Chinese
Art, shortly after which she started as an archivist at Michael Werner gallery
in London.
Ben and Wilhemina began working
together in December 2014 keen to build on their shared ethos: to give artists from
a wide range of professional and educational backgrounds, a platform to fulfil
their vision. The duo avidly support artists who are not represented by a
gallery – giving them a place at the table to articulate their concepts and
proposals.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Benefits of coloring</b></p>
<p>Coloring is not just an activity for keeping kids occupied; we only associate it with children. In reality, coloring books and coloring pages for adults are also extremely therapeutic and can help generate wellness, quietness, mindfulness and the exact same benefits which meditation imparts  on the brain.</p>
<p>Let us study the top 10 benefits of coloring pages for adults in details.</p>
<p><b>1. Coloring pages for adults help de-stress</b></p>
<p>One of the earliest scientists to have studied the therapeutic benefits of coloring pages for adults was Carl Jung. He studied coloring of Mandalas as early as the first half of the 20th century. He often used Mandalas (which have concentric circles and geometrical patterns in them) for his patients and found that it helped them become calmer and witness lesser stress.</p>
<p><b>2. Coloring activities activate both parts of the cerebral hemisphere</b></p>
<p>According to psychologist Gloria Martinez Ayala, the action of coloring involves both logic and creativity. When we use logic to pick up a color for a particular shape or pattern, we activate the analytical part of the brain. On the other hand, when we choose to mix and match colors, we activate the creative side of the brain. This helps incorporate both areas of the cerebral cortex which control vision and help with coordination and fine motor skills.</p>
<p><b>3. Coloring pages for adults take them back to childhood</b></p>
<p>When an adult colors, s/he is transported back to the stress free days of childhood. Getting back those happy memories helps one relax and even feel optimistic and energetic for the future.</p>
<p><b>4. Coloring is like meditation</b></p>
<p>Meditation is the art of doing nothing. It is also the art of ‘de-concentrating’ which helps relax and reduce the chatter of a restless mind. While most people find it difficult to meditate, coloring pages and books for adults easily help induce the same meditative state. It is no wonder that many publishers in UK, France and USA have come up with coloring books just for adults. Coloring Mandalas are especially relaxing since coloring of the round and round patterns and concentric circles of these ancient designs relax the mind and make a person more mindful. It also keeps him/her focused on the present moment-just like meditation!</p>
<p><b>5. Coloring for adults helps reduce anxiety</b></p>
<p>Anxiety is a common mental condition affecting hundreds of adults. Anxiety and panic attacks cause many symptoms including: thoughts of death or dying, excessive worry, nausea, headaches, chills, fever, insomnia, etc. By using coloring pages for adults, therapists help their adult patients relax. The artistic expression helps patients go deeper into a relaxed state making other forms of therapy more effective. Research has now proven that coloring pages and books for adults can be used as prelude to regular or conventional therapy for many mental disorders.</p>
<p><b>6. Coloring for adults helps them re-discover themselves</b></p>
<p>Adults often find themselves stuck in a rut managing jobs, housework etc. Coloring pages can help one get out of this routine, making them feel more comfortable and relaxed at the end of a long day. This activity can also help one be with his/her thoughts. Many an adult has rediscovered him/herself through coloring pages for adults online and offline. You can even download free coloring apps or coloring printables and relax with this wonderful activity at the end of a long day.</p>
<p><b>7. Coloring for adults is a perfect therapy for many diseases</b></p>
<p>Coloring books for adults are ideal for patients -especially those battling health issues like epilepsy. Take the example of Cari Schofield, 38, from Stockbridge, Georgia who, due to her epilepsy, had several limitations. Since she started coloring, she finds she easily calms down and relax which, in turn, helps alleviate epileptic attacks. Due to her jerky hand movements, she used to experience difficulty holding a pen or pencil for drawing. But, by using coloring books for adults, she has started enjoying this activity again.</p>
<p><b>8. Coloring for adults helps spark creativity</b></p>
<p>One of the most important benefits of coloring books for adults is that they help ignite creativity which adults continue to experience in several other facets of their lives. Adults who color regularly find that they become great at picking colors for their clothes, their interiors etc. Coloring books and pages also help people become more creative in their jobs, analytical thinking activities and several other aspects of work and play.</p>
<p><b>9. Coloring helps adults reconnect with their Inner Child</b></p>
<p>Inner Child healing therapy is a popular therapy for disturbed adults who tend to be very harsh with themselves. As adults, we often have certain areas in our lives that need working on and all those areas are connected to certain issues which we carry forward from our past. When one reconnects with his/her inner child, a child full of innocence and love, one can actually become better as an adult. Such inner child healing especially helps break negative thinking patterns. It helps one love him/herself more-unconditionally. This, in turn, helps one become one’s best self-a confidant, radiant person who is ready to take on the world without fear.</p>
<p><b>10. Coloring books for adults help transport one to a time and place faraway</b></p>
<p>If, at the end of the day, you really wish to relax and get away from it all-simply bring out your crayons and download some coloring pages. This will surely help you get out and away from it all and help you relax and unwind. It is like taking a vacation without going anywhere!</p>

<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514146210/hfdyakfanxbbckvehrv2.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>I make paintings using found photographs as source material. I'm drawn to inane moments, awkward expressions, and uncomfortable interactions that can be captured objectively by a camera. After painting the image realistically, I add abstract visual elements to create a disruption and spark an emotional response. The intrusions in my paintings evoke different responses in individual viewers; comings and goings, presence and absence, privacy and exposure, reality and memory. </p>
<p>Check out my <a href=""http://shelleymonahan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> for more images of my artwork!</p>
<p>I show my paintings one or two times a year in the Bay Area, at a variety of venues including galleries, community spaces, and local businesses. I also regularly participate in Open Studios. All of these opportunities have been local to the SF Bay Area, and the next big step for my career is attaining meaningful exposure in new cities. I've set my sights on Los Angeles, and the stARTup Art Fair!</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.startupartfair.com/la/overview/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stARTup Art Fair LA</a> is a unique and exciting opportunity for myself and the other artists who have been invited! <a href=""https://www.thekinneyvenicebeach.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Kinney Venice Beach</a> is hosting the 2018 LA-based fair. Over the course of the three-day event, over 50 artists will each take over one room of this stylish hotel in Venice Beach. Most art fairs function as trade shows for well-established galleries, which can tend to exclude emerging and unrepresented artists like myself. stARTup Art Fair's mission is to provide a professional exhibition venue for independent artists where they can present and sell their work on their own terms, and the public can acquire amazing artwork from some of the best independent artists working today. The event is juried by a group of excellent curators, gallery owners, collectors and business owners; I'm incredibly honored to have been selected.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514148832/bldn4ay77p3lws3ohyxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need &amp; what you get!</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges to participating at stARTup Art Fair is the cost. During the final home stretch until the show (just one month left!) I need to focus on finishing paintings, organizing my additional supplies, and packing up for the journey. $5000 is the amount I am hoping to raise with this funding campaign! The vast majority of that amount will cover the base participation fees, which total $4000. The remaining $1000 will be used for logistics and sundry supplies such as packing materials, and to cover Indiegogo fees and perk fulfillment costs.</p>
<p>Of course I would love to exceed my funding goal, but I feel the amount I've set my sights on strikes a  balance between the cost of the event and an attainable goal.</p>
<p>It was important to me to offer perks for backing my campaign that are unique! Many of the perks  are one-of-a-kind opportunities to get custom artwork from me, and I won't offer them again. I'm also offering high-quality prints of my work at a steep discount from the price I typically sell them, as huge THANK YOU for backing my project. If you've wanted a print or original of my work before now, this is the time to jump at the opportunity!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514148678/tlhtv3arhvqfjhhmoxgb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any opportunity as an artist, there is no guarantee that I will ""break even"" via art sales, or make that perfect fit connection to a gallery or venue at this art fair. Accepting this risk, my goal for this show is purely wider exposure, and I trust that other opportunities and advancements will happen organically as a result. </p>
<p>When I participated in stARTup San Francisco earlier this year, I met a lot of enthusiastic art fans and had some great conversations but didn't close the fair with any concrete leads. Since then, I've gotten follow-ups about some exciting new opportunities, and it allowed me to connect with <a href=""https://rootdivision.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Root Division</a> and join their Studio Artist program as of July. These connections were an invaluable result of participating in that show, and I have faith that the Los Angeles version will provide similar chances for my career.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514146324/n55ilygegwyhmkapjqmw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","I make paintings using found photographs as source material. I'm drawn to inane moments, awkward expressions, and uncomfortable interactions that can be captured objectively by a camera. After painting the image realistically, I add abstract visual elements to create a disruption and spark an emotional response. The intrusions in my paintings evoke different responses in individual viewers; comings and goings, presence and absence, privacy and exposure, reality and memory. 
Check out my website for more images of my artwork!
I show my paintings one or two times a year in the Bay Area, at a variety of venues including galleries, community spaces, and local businesses. I also regularly participate in Open Studios. All of these opportunities have been local to the SF Bay Area, and the next big step for my career is attaining meaningful exposure in new cities. I've set my sights on Los Angeles, and the stARTup Art Fair!
stARTup Art Fair LA is a unique and exciting opportunity for myself and the other artists who have been invited! The Kinney Venice Beach is hosting the 2018 LA-based fair. Over the course of the three-day event, over 50 artists will each take over one room of this stylish hotel in Venice Beach. Most art fairs function as trade shows for well-established galleries, which can tend to exclude emerging and unrepresented artists like myself. stARTup Art Fair's mission is to provide a professional exhibition venue for independent artists where they can present and sell their work on their own terms, and the public can acquire amazing artwork from some of the best independent artists working today. The event is juried by a group of excellent curators, gallery owners, collectors and business owners; I'm incredibly honored to have been selected.


What I need & what you get!
One of the biggest challenges to participating at stARTup Art Fair is the cost. During the final home stretch until the show (just one month left!) I need to focus on finishing paintings, organizing my additional supplies, and packing up for the journey. $5000 is the amount I am hoping to raise with this funding campaign! The vast majority of that amount will cover the base participation fees, which total $4000. The remaining $1000 will be used for logistics and sundry supplies such as packing materials, and to cover Indiegogo fees and perk fulfillment costs.
Of course I would love to exceed my funding goal, but I feel the amount I've set my sights on strikes a  balance between the cost of the event and an attainable goal.
It was important to me to offer perks for backing my campaign that are unique! Many of the perks  are one-of-a-kind opportunities to get custom artwork from me, and I won't offer them again. I'm also offering high-quality prints of my work at a steep discount from the price I typically sell them, as huge THANK YOU for backing my project. If you've wanted a print or original of my work before now, this is the time to jump at the opportunity!


Challenges
As with any opportunity as an artist, there is no guarantee that I will ""break even"" via art sales, or make that perfect fit connection to a gallery or venue at this art fair. Accepting this risk, my goal for this show is purely wider exposure, and I trust that other opportunities and advancements will happen organically as a result. 
When I participated in stARTup San Francisco earlier this year, I met a lot of enthusiastic art fans and had some great conversations but didn't close the fair with any concrete leads. Since then, I've gotten follow-ups about some exciting new opportunities, and it allowed me to connect with Root Division and join their Studio Artist program as of July. These connections were an invaluable result of participating in that show, and I have faith that the Los Angeles version will provide similar chances for my career.

Que mon objectif soit atteint ou pas, le voyage se fera quand même car je suis convaincue de la viabilité du projet et du rayonnement qu'il aura pour les artistes d'ici et d'ailleurs. Si par bonheur l'objectif se voit dépassé, le surplus sera versé dans les bourses qui seront remis aux artistes récipiendaires de la prochaine édition (2015).
Ha oui... le départ est déjà fixé, je décolle le 26 septembre 2014!


Parlez-en!

<p>Taking place in a soon-to-be-demolished gas station off the Bellville Turnpike, the location is both a reminder of what remains since the automobile industry collapse, and of the ways to bring art and discussion to an otherwise dormant space.

I have held many roles in musicals and plays, but once I got into college, the opportunity for performance never presented itself much until about a year and a half ago. I was given the opportunity to model a body paint for an event and on that day, I found my new performance niche! Body Art has given me the chance in my adult life to do what I love, perform! I have also been graced with a sense of self confidence that is sometimes hard to find as an adult searching for a place in the world. It is such a privilege and honor to be able to bring to life the vision behind the art of the artist! Now, don't be fooled in thinking that being a body paint model is just a bunch of standing around looking nice. It is much more complex of an experience. It requires extreme self discipline, ability to take part when needed in the creative process, stamina, positive attitude, ability to perform during extreme pressure, among a loooong list of other attributes needed to be an outstanding human canvas! Every time that I am given the opportunity to model for an artist, I am excited to be able to improve as a model and performer. Working with different artists provides many great challenges and rewards as an emerging body paint model. Since then I have gone on to perform in many performance based body art shows and competitions in the US.  Being a LIVING canvas has also pushed me to learn new performance techniques such as Hula Hooping, Aerial Silks, Lyra and Chinese Silk Fans!</p><p>The opportunity has now presented itself for me to join an amazing artist and friend as her model for the World Body Paint Competition in Austria!! </p><p>Our team (Artist: Brittany Pelloquin, Assistant: Kimberly Davis, and Model: Me :D) Will be leaving this coming Sunday, June 28th for our 10 day journey to Austria for the biggest Body Paint Competition in the WORLD!!! </p><p>I know that it is last minute, but what a better time than now to help out a group of ladies that have the biggest heart, the most positive attitudes and the most outstanding desire to WIN!!! </p><p>Should you decide to help us out, the funds will go to housing while we are there, meals, general travel expenses and supplies needed for competition.

<p><b>Art changes lives and is a powerful tool for change.</b>Art has always been part of my life and I knew early
on that creativity was what I wanted to work with. I also realised that I’ve
been healing my own broken self by using art as therapy when growing up. </p>
<p><b>Early 2016 I will be working with Art Relief
International in Chang Mai, an artistic outreach organisation that works
with a wide range of social groups and humanitarian organisations. I will have
the opportunity to work with various groups including Burmese refugees,
indigenous hill tribe groups, children and adults with intellectual and / or
physical disabilities and children from local orphanages, to name a few. I will
also work with children from various 'Temple' (Government) Schools across
Chiang Mai which are unable to offer art as part of their curriculum. </b></p>
<p><b>I am looking for contributions towards the project fee
of £1000. You can simply donate but also help out by buying my art as all sales
will go towards this project. Even the smallest amount will be incredibly
helpful.</b></p>
<p>My background</p>
<p>I’ve studied art in Sweden and London and have worked as an
artist and workshop facilitator for over 10 years mostly with vulnerable
groups. I have also studied Psychology and have a diploma in Art Therapy from
Metafora, Barcelona and certificates from London Art Therapy Centre. I believe
that creativity has no boundaries and I am truly passionate about the positive
impact it can have when using creativity as a development and well-being tool.</p>
<p>About Art Relief and Cultural Canvas</p>
<p>Art Relief is a professional placement with research and
development opportunities rather than traditional volunteering so I am likely
to come home with new insights and ideas on how to further improve the lives of
Londoners through art. There will also be a need for a translator as many
groups won’t have had much education if any and my basic Thai lessons will only
stretch so far. Art Relief is part of Cultural Canvas Thailand, a non-profit,
non-government organisation. $1799 is the full amount for the placement
covering. We’ve already covered $300 of that to secure the placement and it
works out as the same amount as the fundraising fee of 5%. The cost of my
flights and internal transport to reach Chang Mai has already kindly been
donated. Check out their websites for more thorough info.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of the project fee:</p>
<p>4% - Administrative: website development and management, postage
and correspondence with organizations and universities</p>
<p>4% - Outreach: website development and management, postage and
correspondence with organizations and universities</p>
<p>Program Costs - 82%</p>
<p>19% - Housing</p>
<p>10% - Food</p>
<p>9% - Transportation</p>
<p>6% - Insurance: travel insurance for the duration of placement</p>
<p>12% - Placement Coordination: pre-departure costs of
communication, postage, handbooks, screening, AND in-coutry support and
orientation, in-country staff,</p>
<p>17% - Program Development and Management: research and selection
of volunteer placement, in-country director and staff, ongoing program
management, postage and communication costs associated with recruiting
volunteers</p>
<p>7% - Host Organization Support: $100 is contributed to your
partner project</p>
<p>2% - Miscellaneous: fees, unforeseen costs associated with
volunteer consumption</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>I know everyone can’t contribute and it’s a week before
Christmas (if you’re “doing” Christmas) but you can still help.</p>
<p>Help me get the word out by sharing this! Make some noise!

</div>Hello, everyone! My name's Alicia Mello and I am a student at Shasta College. Since the Fall of 2013, I have attended art classes (either for transfer or just for fun). It is now April 2015 and eventually, I'll be transferring out of the college. Well, I wanted to do something to pay my respects to the art department (since I'm a BIIIIIG fan of the department, let alone the staff members are very nice). I wanted to somehow donate money for a good cause. Since the Student Art Exhibit is coming up, it would be a great idea to give funds for it. I hope the amount I put will be raised. If not, that's totally fine! Thank you to those that're reading this and have a great day!<p></p></div>","Hello, everyone! My name's Alicia Mello and I am a student at Shasta College.

<h3>Hi, I'm Emmie.</h3>
<p>I like to draw things. I also like to write things. I especially like things that combine those first two things, which is where this little project first started.</p>
<p>I've spent the last 3 years pondering, doodling, (and perhaps procrastinating on)  haikus. What began as a frivolous side project, steadily became a mission with a very real end goal: <strong>publish an art book. </strong>Now, I've collated the best of the bunch and am ready to get printing! <i>But</i> as with most art graduates, I'm a little bit broke and need your help to make it happen.</p>
<h2><strong>It will cost £500 to print, produce, package and ship the first batch of 60 books.</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>A lot of the funds raised will actually be going towards the packaging and shipping, since the real world sucks and logistics are more expensive than you'd think. Not to mention, these fancy rewards aren't gonna fund themselves!</p>
<h3>BUT, you'll get a book that is:</h3>
<ul>
<li>140mm x 140mm - the perfect size for your coffee table (I promise!)</li>
<li>Hard back, matte, printed cover (Ooh! Aah!)</li>
<li>Digital full colour print on silk 135 gsm paper (fancy, shiny, good quality stuff!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>Plus a warm, fuzzy feeling in your heart, of course.</div><div> </div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>I'll be using an independent, UK based printer. If we're successful in reaching the goal amount, I'll be sending for a sample print, and making final adjustments. This could take a little time, but once everything is perfect, we'll be good to go!</p>

We plan to start the poll very soon!Full list is going to be our secret for now – you’ll find out who they all are when you get your deck! ;)""WILD"" CARDAs our special “Thank you” for helping us to bring this project to life we reserve one “Wild” Card for the highest bidder on the Special pledge. If you want to see your image on the card among others please follow the link to participate in the auction. The Link will be available in this section soon. For compliance reasons we are doing this outside of Kickstarter. Stand by for updates. DistributionAs our contribution to promotion of our new Government worldwide besides making the cards available through usual distribution channels we plan to send a deck to each leader of the Governments of every 193 countries – members of the United Nations (if such shipment is legally permitted from the United States) and to all people from the Time magazine list “The 100 Most Influential People” 2016.TimelineThis Deck could be a perfect gift for January 20, 2017 – the date of Inauguration of the 25th President of the United States Donald J Trump but… Many positions in the Cabinet require the US Senate approval. That’s why we can start the Deck production only after this happens. We assume that approval takes no more than 2 month. Another 6 weeks (maximum) we need to complete the design (some candidates can be replaced and our designers we’ll need to make new cards), print decks and ship them to our distribution warehouse. So we plan that no later than June 2017 (or sooner) we’ll be able to start shipping first pledgesConcept: June - December 2016Funding: January 2017Design completion: February - March 2017Production: April 2017Shipping: June 2017About usUnicorn Publishing is a truly inclusive organization. We generate most of our titles in-house and in most cases our books are manufactured by local printers. Nevertheless, we are always open to collaborate with all professionals, artists, and writers from around the country and worldwide. We are concentrating our efforts on creating best content that is interesting, educational, and fun to read/watch/play with.",16.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign is my residual inspiration to sustain a creative lifestyle, always pushing my limits and developing styles unique to every environment and situation. Making art for the now, as well as creating classic works for the future is a huge commitment that I am able to make, thanks in large part to YOUR support over the years. </p>

<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>I put myself out there when starting big walls, or even attempting to grab ideas in someone's head when working on their commissions. There is a great deal of risk involved, not only of falling off a scaffold to the death, but also of public opinion. Though hardly calloused, I take every utterance to heart and it motivates me to work harder and push forward. </p>
<p>If you are reading this, I hope you realize what a significant impact the actions you take have on my life and so many others. <i><strong>Today is the day, now is the time, let's really make it count!</strong></i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nathalie Jean. I have been a tattoo artist in Montréal for 25 years. During the pandemic I have been drawing and designing paper doll crafts of celebrities and characters that I admire and sharing them online to give people a distraction. I managed to publish my first volume of paper doll coloring crafts in a book called «  Not Maintream » with the help of a crowd fund and pre order last spring. Now, with your help, I am trying to gather funds for the publishing of my second and hopefully my third book which I have drawn during the quarantine. I would like to this by offering preorders of my second book « Heartthrob ». This money would allow me to order and publish my second coloring book and hopefully my third book called « FIERCE » which is a collection of female icons that I love.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise 3000.00$ to help with the printing costs of my paper doll coloring books. With these pre orders from buyers I can get some help to raise money to make my books happen. This money will cover printing as well as individual shipping costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone’s contributions are very appreciated. I started drawing these dolls for fun and decided to share them online and give them to people for something to pass the time with.I began to receive positive emails from Europe and other countries and I have even made some new connections and friendships through my last book crowd funding. Creating these books have given me joy and helped me pass the time during quarantine. They are a way for me to connect with people and hopefully give something fun for them to do and share. The celebrities and characters I chose in my doll books are not necessarily ones that we would typically find in such crafts books and their legacy is important to me. Hopefully they bring joy to other fans or help people discover new things.</p>
<p>THANK YOU </p>
<p>MERCI</p>
