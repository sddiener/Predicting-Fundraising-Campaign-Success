hayali üzerine bir yazı. </p><b>
</b><p>Ben Emre Yıldızlar, henüz sadece 24 yaşındayım. Burdur,
Samsun, Kars ve Antalya'da yaşadıktan sonra, üniversite eğitimim için
İstanbul'a gittim. Galatasaray Üniversitesi Fransız Dili ve Edebiyatı Bölümü'nü
başarıyla bitirdim. Henüz yaş iken eğildim tiyatroya, hala eğiliyorum ve ağaç
rolünü kapana kadar da eğilmeye devam edeceğim. Zira şimdiye kadar yuttuğum
sahne tozu beni doyurmadı. Bugüne kadar birçok tiyatro atölyesine katıldım,
oyun yazdım, kısa bir oyun yönettim, ödül aldım, ödül alamadım, Fransızca
tiyatroda rol aldım, dekora, kostüme, ışığa, kısacası bir oyun izlediğinizde
gördüğünüz her şeye elimden geldiğince katkıda bulundum. Bir de baktım ki
okuldan çok tiyatroya vakit ayırıyorum, ama bana hala yetmiyor. Sonra kalktım,
bir çay demledim ve dedim ki <b>""Bu dünyada senin üreteceğin bir şey varsa o
da tiyatro.""</b> Ufak bir uğraş böylece büyük bir hayale dönüştü. Ben de bu
hayali gerçekleştirmeye koyuldum, çünkü o an erteleseydim, hala erteliyor ve
yolun yarısına gelmemiş olacaktım. Hiçbir yere gelmemiş olacaktım, hala düşünüyor ama hareket etmiyor olacaktım. Hep yaptığımız gibi...Ama yolun yarısından geri dönmeye de niyetim
yok.</p>
<p>Şu an ilk senesinin son sömestrinde olduğum okulun adı
""Ecole Internationale de Theatre LASSAAD"" (<a href=""http://www.lassaad.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lassaad.com</a>). Brüksel'de, dünyanın birçok ülkesinden gelen öğrencileri ağırlayan bu
okul vücut, hareket ve maske tiyatrosu üzerine öğrencilerine 2 yıl süren yoğun
bir eğitim veriyor. </p>
<p>31 yıllık bu okulun ilk Türk öğrencisiyim. Fakat Türk
olmak ve eğitim için tiyatroyu seçmiş olmak, maddi destek bulabilmek için
yeterince büyük engeller. İlk seneyi, emekli memur olan babamın ve evde zaman
zaman terzilik yapan annemin birikimleri ve abimin destekleriyle tamamlamak
üzereyim. Fakat hayalimi yarıda bırakmamak için okulun ikinci ve son senesini
de okuyup, artık meyve vermek üzere yola koyulmam gerek. Ve bunun için tek sıkıntı,
ne 2. bir ailemin ne de bir memuriyet daha bekleyecek vaktimin olması. Bu
yüzden, “çevremde bulunan sizlerden ve sizin çevrenizden oluşan geniş bir
ailenin destekleriyle belki de hayalimi gerçekleştirebilirim”  düşüncesiyle bu projeyi sunmaya karar verdim.

bir senelik ücreti : 4950 avro. Sitenin ve paypal'ın keseceği komisyon bana ait
olacak. Brüksel'deki geçimimi ise (bir senedir vize talebim beklemede olduğu
için resmi olarak bir işte çalışamasam da, öğrenci buldukça özel dil dersleri
veriyorum.) kendim ve ailemin destekleriyle karşılamaya devam edeceğim.
Hedefime ulaştığım ve okulu bitirdiğim takdirde, Türkiye'de henüz az tanınan bu
tiyatro pedagojisini, Avrupa'nın diğer şehirlerinde benzer bir eğitim alan
arkadaşlarımla birlikte Türkiye'de de yaymayı ve geliştirmeyi, sizin de
desteklerinizle belki de bir tiyatro ormanı yaratmayı düşlüyoruz. Ayrıca, aldığım 2 yıllık eğitimin sonunda Jacques Lecoq tarafından yazılmış olan <b>""Le Corps Poétique""</b> eserini Türkçe'ye kazandırmayı hedefliyorum.  <br/></p>

<br/></b></p><p><b>Theater and me,</b></p><p>Hello,</p><p>My project is about planting a theater tree and growing it up. And this tree is me!</p><p>I am Emre Yıldızlar and I’m a 24 year-old young passionate with theater. After having lived in different cities of Turkey, I moved to İstanbul and studied French Literature in Galatasaray University. I put forth my roots on theater when I was really young and all I need now is some water that you can give me.</p><p>So far, I’ve participated in many workshops, written plays, put on a short play, got rewards and couldn’t get rewards, I performed in Turkish and in French, and I’ve tried my best to be helpful to anything you can see on a theater play (décor, lights, costumes, etc.) These are all my amateur experiences. But last year, when I was drinking my tea and thinking about my future like all of my undergraduate friends, I said to myself: <b>“If there’s something that you can create in this world, it is theater.</b>” While theater was an ordinary occupation, it occupied my whole life and became my dream. Thus, I set out to realize this dream. Because I know; if I had waited then, I would be waiting all my life… as we do all the time, as we don’t do anything…</p><p>As of now, I’m in the last trimester of the first year of “Ecole Internationale de Theatre LASSAAD” in Brussels. (<a href=""http://www.lassaad.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lassaad.com</a>). The education offered by the school to its international students from all over the world is based on the physical playing of the actor, movement and the mask theater. This special pedagogy is taught during 2 years in an intensive way.</p><p>I’m the first Turkish student of this 31 year-old school. However, being a Turkish and choosing theater as a career are two biggest obstacles if you want to have a scholarship. I cannot have a scholarship in Europe since I’m not European and there is no scholarship for theater studies in Turkey. But, these obstacles are not strong enough to stop me from realizing my dream. I paid the first year of the school with the help of my parents’ buildup. But unfortunately, I don’t have a second family for my second and last year at school. That’s why I launch this project and that’s why I try to create a second family consisting of you. In brief, that’s why I need your support. </p><p><b>Funding</b></p><p>The amount I need to raise is 4950 euros which is the annual tuition fee of the school. After the commissions of the website and Paypal, I’ll get more or less 4500 euros. I will make my living by working this summer and next year during the school. Upon reaching my goal of finishing this school, I dream - with my other friends who are studying theater in different cities in Europe – of introducing and spreading this pedagogy in Turkey where it is not well known yet. Therefore, any support that you can give me will help us grow up a theater forest! I hope that you consider giving some water to this tree. Besides, at the end of my 2 years education, I'm planning to translate the masterpiece called <b>""The Moving Body""</b> written by Jacques Lecoq into Turkish. <br/></p><p><b>How will I thank you</b></p><p>I created five different categories for the donations, but you are free to modify the amount. And in return, I would like to thank you with theater.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Théâtre et moi,</b></p>
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>Mon projet, le voici, je veux planter un
arbre, un arbre de théâtre que je pourrais nourrir, arroser.</p>
<p>Et… Cet arbre c'est moi!</p>
<p>Je suis Emre Yıldızlar, un jeune de 24 ans
passionné par le théâtre. Apres avoir vécu dans différentes villes en Turquie,
je suis allé à İstanbul où j’ai étudié la Littérature Française à l’Université
de Galatasaray.</p>
<p>J’ai commencé à prendre racine dans le
théâtre alors que j’étais tout jeune et ce dont j’ai besoin, maintenant, c'est
d'un peu d’eau, l'eau que vous pourrez me donner.</p>
<p>Jusqu’à présent, j’ai participé à des
ateliers, j’ai écrit des pièces, j’ai aussi mis un spectacle en scène et j’ai obtenu
des prix. J’ai joué en turc et en français, et j’ai fait de mon mieux pour
aider à tout ce qui peut contribuer à la réalisation d'un spectacle (décor,
lumières, costumes, etc.). Toutes mes expériences furent en tant qu'amateur,
on peut dire cela.</p>
<p>Mais l’année dernière, alors que je buvais mon
thé, un de ces matins, j'ai pensé à mon avenir, comme tous mes amis étudiants,
(comme beaucoup d'étudiants en fait!) et je me suis dit <b>«S’il y a un moyen de
créer, de sublimer les choses, pour moi, dans ce monde, ce sera grâce au
théâtre ».</b></p>
<p>Alors que le théâtre était un simple
passe-temps pour moi, il a occupé toute ma vie et il est devenu mon rêve.
Ainsi, je me suis mis à réaliser mon rêve. Parce que j'ai su à ce moment-là que
je ne pouvais plus attendre, que si j'attendais encore je serais encore en
train d’attendre aujourd'hui. Comme on le fait tout le temps, comme on ne fait
rien qu’attendre…</p>
<p>Voilà, à présent, je suis au dernier
trimestre de la première année de « L’Ecole Internationale de Théâtre
LASSAAD » à Bruxelles. (<a href=""http://www.lassaad.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.lassaad.com</span></a>). Elle propose un
enseignement théâtral basé sur<span>le mouvement, l'art de
la maîtrise du corps et du jeu.<br/><br/><br/>
Une formation intensive de 2 ans, offrant un parcours allant du Masque Neutre au jeu, à
travers tous les styles : Pantomime, Bandes dessinées, Cinéma muet, Mélodrame,
Mélomime, Conteur, Tragédie, Commedia dell'Arte, Bouffons, Clowns, Masques
expressifs et larvaires...</span></p>
<p><span>Je suis le premier élève turc de cette école de 31 ans
d'existence. Pourtant, être un turc et choisir le théâtre en tant que
profession sont de grands obstacles si vous voulez demander une bourse.</span></p>
<p><span>En effet, je ne peux pas obtenir une bourse en Europe parce que je
ne suis pas européen et il n’y a pas de bourses en Turquie pour les études
pratiques théâtrales. Mais pourtant ces obstacles ne m’empêcheront pas de
réaliser mon rêve. J’ai payé la première année grâce aux épargnes de ma
famille. Malheureusement je n’ai pas de deuxième famille pour la deuxième et
dernière année de l’école!</span></p>
<p><span>Ainsi j’ai lancé ce projet afin de créer ma deuxième famille,
vous.</span></p>
<p><span>J’ai besoin de votre soutien. </span></p>
<p><b>Donations</b></p>
<p>La somme dont j'ai besoin s'élève à 4950

4500 euros.</p>
<p>Aussi, je vais travailler cet été ainsi que
l’année prochaine, en dehors de l’école, pour gagner ma vie et subvenir aux
frais extérieurs. Si je peux atteindre mon but dans ce projet, je rêve, avec
mes amis étudiant en théâtre, tous dans différentes villes d’Europe,

hayali üzerine bir yazı. 
Ben Emre Yıldızlar, henüz sadece 24 yaşındayım. Burdur,
Samsun, Kars ve Antalya'da yaşadıktan sonra, üniversite eğitimim için
İstanbul'a gittim. Galatasaray Üniversitesi Fransız Dili ve Edebiyatı Bölümü'nü
başarıyla bitirdim. Henüz yaş iken eğildim tiyatroya, hala eğiliyorum ve ağaç
rolünü kapana kadar da eğilmeye devam edeceğim. Zira şimdiye kadar yuttuğum
sahne tozu beni doyurmadı. Bugüne kadar birçok tiyatro atölyesine katıldım,
oyun yazdım, kısa bir oyun yönettim, ödül aldım, ödül alamadım, Fransızca
tiyatroda rol aldım, dekora, kostüme, ışığa, kısacası bir oyun izlediğinizde
gördüğünüz her şeye elimden geldiğince katkıda bulundum. Bir de baktım ki
okuldan çok tiyatroya vakit ayırıyorum, ama bana hala yetmiyor. Sonra kalktım,
bir çay demledim ve dedim ki ""Bu dünyada senin üreteceğin bir şey varsa o
da tiyatro."" Ufak bir uğraş böylece büyük bir hayale dönüştü. Ben de bu
hayali gerçekleştirmeye koyuldum, çünkü o an erteleseydim, hala erteliyor ve
yolun yarısına gelmemiş olacaktım. Hiçbir yere gelmemiş olacaktım, hala düşünüyor ama hareket etmiyor olacaktım. Hep yaptığımız gibi...Ama yolun yarısından geri dönmeye de niyetim
yok.
Şu an ilk senesinin son sömestrinde olduğum okulun adı
""Ecole Internationale de Theatre LASSAAD"" (http://www.lassaad.com). Brüksel'de, dünyanın birçok ülkesinden gelen öğrencileri ağırlayan bu
okul vücut, hareket ve maske tiyatrosu üzerine öğrencilerine 2 yıl süren yoğun
bir eğitim veriyor. 
31 yıllık bu okulun ilk Türk öğrencisiyim. Fakat Türk
olmak ve eğitim için tiyatroyu seçmiş olmak, maddi destek bulabilmek için
yeterince büyük engeller. İlk seneyi, emekli memur olan babamın ve evde zaman
zaman terzilik yapan annemin birikimleri ve abimin destekleriyle tamamlamak
üzereyim. Fakat hayalimi yarıda bırakmamak için okulun ikinci ve son senesini
de okuyup, artık meyve vermek üzere yola koyulmam gerek. Ve bunun için tek sıkıntı,
ne 2. bir ailemin ne de bir memuriyet daha bekleyecek vaktimin olması. Bu
yüzden, “çevremde bulunan sizlerden ve sizin çevrenizden oluşan geniş bir
ailenin destekleriyle belki de hayalimi gerçekleştirebilirim”  düşüncesiyle bu projeyi sunmaya karar verdim.
BağışHedefimi gerçekleştirmek için ihtiyacım olan okulun
bir senelik ücreti : 4950 avro. Sitenin ve paypal'ın keseceği komisyon bana ait
olacak. Brüksel'deki geçimimi ise (bir senedir vize talebim beklemede olduğu
için resmi olarak bir işte çalışamasam da, öğrenci buldukça özel dil dersleri
veriyorum.) kendim ve ailemin destekleriyle karşılamaya devam edeceğim.
Hedefime ulaştığım ve okulu bitirdiğim takdirde, Türkiye'de henüz az tanınan bu
tiyatro pedagojisini, Avrupa'nın diğer şehirlerinde benzer bir eğitim alan
arkadaşlarımla birlikte Türkiye'de de yaymayı ve geliştirmeyi, sizin de
desteklerinizle belki de bir tiyatro ormanı yaratmayı düşlüyoruz. Ayrıca, aldığım 2 yıllık eğitimin sonunda Jacques Lecoq tarafından yazılmış olan ""Le Corps Poétique"" eserini Türkçe'ye kazandırmayı hedefliyorum.  
Size nasıl teşekkür edeceğimBu düşü gerçekleştirmemde bana destek vermek
isterseniz, paypal üzerinden yanda gördüğünüz veya sizin belirlediğiniz
miktarlarda bağış yapabilirsiniz. Ben de bu bağışlarınız karşılığında size ayrı ayrı,
tiyatroyla teşekkür etmek isterim: 10 Avro - Yağmur DamlasıBiliyorum
ki yağmur damlaları birikerek bir fidanı ağaca dönüştürecek. Ben de her yağmur
damlası için herhangi bir sosyal medya hesabınıza, selam verdiğim bir fotoğraf
göndererek teşekkür edeceğim.25 Avro - Bir Bardak SuHer
susadığımda bana bir bardak su verecek insanlar olduğunu bilmek güzel. Ben de
size, arkasında size özel bir not bulunan tiyatro temalı bir kartpostal atarak
teşekkür edeceğim50 Avro - ÇeşmebaşıYorulup
mola verdiğimde, çeşmebaşında bana soğuk su verip yola devam etmeme destek
olduğunuz için teşekkürler. Ben de vardığım yerden size tiyatro temalı bir
kartpostal ve kendim hazırlayacağım ufak bir hediye göndereceğim.100 Avro - Yaz YağmuruTam
sıcaktan bunalmışken yağan bir yaz yağmuru ve arkasından açan gökkuşağı kadar
değerli bu yardımınız için ben de size, içine size özel bir not yazacağım bir tiyatro oyunu göndereceğim ve ilerde dilediğiniz bir oyunuma benim davetlim olarak
katılacaksınız.500 Avro - Engin DenizKoca bir
yokuşu tırmanırken tam ""kayboldum"" dediğiniz anda tepeye
ulaştığınızda gördüğünüz deniz kadar umut dolu olduğunuz için teşekkürler. Bu
kadar cömert bir yardım karşısında ben de size, sizin için özel olarak
yapacağım bir tiyatro maskesi göndermek isterim. Ayrıca, gelebildiğiniz her oyunuma da davetlim olarak
katılacaksınız.
Theater and me,Hello,My project is about planting a theater tree and growing it up. And this tree is me!I am Emre Yıldızlar and I’m a 24 year-old young passionate with theater. After having lived in different cities of Turkey, I moved to İstanbul and studied French Literature in Galatasaray University. I put forth my roots on theater when I was really young and all I need now is some water that you can give me.So far, I’ve participated in many workshops, written plays, put on a short play, got rewards and couldn’t get rewards, I performed in Turkish and in French, and I’ve tried my best to be helpful to anything you can see on a theater play (décor, lights, costumes, etc.) These are all my amateur experiences. But last year, when I was drinking my tea and thinking about my future like all of my undergraduate friends, I said to myself: “If there’s something that you can create in this world, it is theater.” While theater was an ordinary occupation, it occupied my whole life and became my dream. Thus, I set out to realize this dream. Because I know; if I had waited then, I would be waiting all my life… as we do all the time, as we don’t do anything…As of now, I’m in the last trimester of the first year of “Ecole Internationale de Theatre LASSAAD” in Brussels. (http://www.lassaad.com). The education offered by the school to its international students from all over the world is based on the physical playing of the actor, movement and the mask theater. This special pedagogy is taught during 2 years in an intensive way.I’m the first Turkish student of this 31 year-old school. However, being a Turkish and choosing theater as a career are two biggest obstacles if you want to have a scholarship. I cannot have a scholarship in Europe since I’m not European and there is no scholarship for theater studies in Turkey. But, these obstacles are not strong enough to stop me from realizing my dream. I paid the first year of the school with the help of my parents’ buildup. But unfortunately, I don’t have a second family for my second and last year at school. That’s why I launch this project and that’s why I try to create a second family consisting of you. In brief, that’s why I need your support. FundingThe amount I need to raise is 4950 euros which is the annual tuition fee of the school. After the commissions of the website and Paypal, I’ll get more or less 4500 euros. I will make my living by working this summer and next year during the school. Upon reaching my goal of finishing this school, I dream - with my other friends who are studying theater in different cities in Europe – of introducing and spreading this pedagogy in Turkey where it is not well known yet. Therefore, any support that you can give me will help us grow up a theater forest! I hope that you consider giving some water to this tree. Besides, at the end of my 2 years education, I'm planning to translate the masterpiece called ""The Moving Body"" written by Jacques Lecoq into Turkish. How will I thank youI created five different categories for the donations, but you are free to modify the amount. And in return, I would like to thank you with theater.Théâtre et moi,
Bonjour,
Mon projet, le voici, je veux planter un
arbre, un arbre de théâtre que je pourrais nourrir, arroser.
Et… Cet arbre c'est moi!
Je suis Emre Yıldızlar, un jeune de 24 ans
passionné par le théâtre. Apres avoir vécu dans différentes villes en Turquie,
je suis allé à İstanbul où j’ai étudié la Littérature Française à l’Université
de Galatasaray.
J’ai commencé à prendre racine dans le
théâtre alors que j’étais tout jeune et ce dont j’ai besoin, maintenant, c'est
d'un peu d’eau, l'eau que vous pourrez me donner.
Jusqu’à présent, j’ai participé à des
ateliers, j’ai écrit des pièces, j’ai aussi mis un spectacle en scène et j’ai obtenu
des prix. J’ai joué en turc et en français, et j’ai fait de mon mieux pour
aider à tout ce qui peut contribuer à la réalisation d'un spectacle (décor,
lumières, costumes, etc.). Toutes mes expériences furent en tant qu'amateur,
on peut dire cela.
Mais l’année dernière, alors que je buvais mon
thé, un de ces matins, j'ai pensé à mon avenir, comme tous mes amis étudiants,
(comme beaucoup d'étudiants en fait!) et je me suis dit «S’il y a un moyen de
créer, de sublimer les choses, pour moi, dans ce monde, ce sera grâce au
théâtre ».
Alors que le théâtre était un simple
passe-temps pour moi, il a occupé toute ma vie et il est devenu mon rêve.
Ainsi, je me suis mis à réaliser mon rêve. Parce que j'ai su à ce moment-là que
je ne pouvais plus attendre, que si j'attendais encore je serais encore en
train d’attendre aujourd'hui. Comme on le fait tout le temps, comme on ne fait
rien qu’attendre…
Voilà, à présent, je suis au dernier
trimestre de la première année de « L’Ecole Internationale de Théâtre
LASSAAD » à Bruxelles. (http://www.lassaad.com). Elle propose un
enseignement théâtral basé surle mouvement, l'art de
la maîtrise du corps et du jeu.
Une formation intensive de 2 ans, offrant un parcours allant du Masque Neutre au jeu, à
travers tous les styles : Pantomime, Bandes dessinées, Cinéma muet, Mélodrame,
Mélomime, Conteur, Tragédie, Commedia dell'Arte, Bouffons, Clowns, Masques
expressifs et larvaires...
Je suis le premier élève turc de cette école de 31 ans
d'existence. Pourtant, être un turc et choisir le théâtre en tant que
profession sont de grands obstacles si vous voulez demander une bourse.
En effet, je ne peux pas obtenir une bourse en Europe parce que je
ne suis pas européen et il n’y a pas de bourses en Turquie pour les études
pratiques théâtrales. Mais pourtant ces obstacles ne m’empêcheront pas de

famille. Malheureusement je n’ai pas de deuxième famille pour la deuxième et
dernière année de l’école!
Ainsi j’ai lancé ce projet afin de créer ma deuxième famille,
vous.
J’ai besoin de votre soutien. 
Donations
La somme dont j'ai besoin s'élève à 4950
euros, cette somme recouvre les frais d'une année d'enseignement à l'école
Lassâad. Apres les commissions du site et Paypal, je recevrai plus ou moins
4500 euros.
Aussi, je vais travailler cet été ainsi que
l’année prochaine, en dehors de l’école, pour gagner ma vie et subvenir aux

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Niña and Abi, budding wildlife biologists from the Philippines. Niña is a young instructor in a university in the Philippines, teaching wildlife ecology and conservation. Her interests are on the study of bats and small mammals. On the other hand, Abi is currently a full-time masters student, studying frogs and reptiles and at the same time a museum volunteer. Though both of us are specializing in different groups of animals, we both have the same goal: to learn, understand, and protect the endangered species of our country.</p>
<p>Among over a hundred applicants from across the globe, only 26 students and young researchers were accepted in the 8<sup>th</sup> Advanced Fieldcourse in Ecology and Conservation at Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG), China which will take place on October 9 – November 20, 2016. We were fortunate to be the representative of the Philippines in this intensive field course.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The field course will focus on field research methods, which includes research design, sampling, data analysis, and among others. We personally want to learn more about the use of the statistical tool R, GIS, and spatial modelling. We believe that this training will greatly help us in our future works in ecology and conservation.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $3000 that we are raising will be used for the plane ticket, food and accommodation (for 6 weeks), visa application, insurance, and other incidental expenses. Here is where the $3000 will go:</p>
<p>(1) roundtrip ticket from Manila to Xishuangbanna (through China Southern Airlines) - $700  each (=$1400 for 2)</p>
<p>(2) accommodation (for 6 weeks) - $500 each (=$1000 for 2)</p>
<p>(3) visa application - $50 each (=$100 for 2)</p>
<p>(4) travel insurance - $50 each (=$100 for 2)</p>
<p>(5) incidental expenses - $400</p>
<p>For the organizer's counterpart, they granted us scholarship for the course fee/tuition fee and meals (for 6 weeks). </p>

<p>Rest assured that all of the funding that we will generate will be used to attend in this once in a lifetime experience. If unluckily we don't reach our entire goal of raising $3000, the funds from those generous backers will be used to at least pay for the airfare. If luckily we raise the entire $3000, exciting perks will be given to our generous backers. We will assure you that you will enjoy the nature trip in the Philippines if you will donate $1000. :)</p>

We are Niña and Abi, budding wildlife biologists from the Philippines. Niña is a young instructor in a university in the Philippines, teaching wildlife ecology and conservation. Her interests are on the study of bats and small mammals. On the other hand, Abi is currently a full-time masters student, studying frogs and reptiles and at the same time a museum volunteer. Though both of us are specializing in different groups of animals, we both have the same goal: to learn, understand, and protect the endangered species of our country.
Among over a hundred applicants from across the globe, only 26 students and young researchers were accepted in the 8th Advanced Fieldcourse in Ecology and Conservation at Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG), China which will take place on October 9 – November 20, 2016. We were fortunate to be the representative of the Philippines in this intensive field course.


 
The field course will focus on field research methods, which includes research design, sampling, data analysis, and among others. We personally want to learn more about the use of the statistical tool R, GIS, and spatial modelling. We believe that this training will greatly help us in our future works in ecology and conservation.
To know more about the field course, please see link below.

What We Need & What You Get
The $3000 that we are raising will be used for the plane ticket, food and accommodation (for 6 weeks), visa application, insurance, and other incidental expenses. Here is where the $3000 will go:
(1) roundtrip ticket from Manila to Xishuangbanna (through China Southern Airlines) - $700  each (=$1400 for 2)
(2) accommodation (for 6 weeks) - $500 each (=$1000 for 2)
(3) visa application - $50 each (=$100 for 2)
(4) travel insurance - $50 each (=$100 for 2)
(5) incidental expenses - $400
For the organizer's counterpart, they granted us scholarship for the course fee/tuition fee and meals (for 6 weeks). 

Rest assured that all of the funding that we will generate will be used to attend in this once in a lifetime experience. If unluckily we don't reach our entire goal of raising $3000, the funds from those generous backers will be used to at least pay for the airfare. If luckily we raise the entire $3000, exciting perks will be given to our generous backers. We will assure you that you will enjoy the nature trip in the Philippines if you will donate $1000. :)

<div>If you contribute, I cannot offer you anything I can't make, but I am willing to make personalized gifts of your choosing. I can write you a poem, sing you a song, record a drum solo, draw a picture featuring you riding a dinosaur, record your favorite scene in a movie (be kind and rewind-style) or something funny/crazy like chugging soy sauce and putting it on Youtube.

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We’re building this facility to help athletes grow and provide them with resources that were not available to us. These athletes may love the game, but without guidance and a place to train they cannot develop their passion like others that have the resources in different parts of the world. In our city, other sports take precedence and we have select facilities with minimum availability to utilize for basketball. Our focus is the youth, our purpose is to build a platform that will afford them opportunities not readily available to us coming up in this city. We want to dedicate a space to the game we love, and allow the youth to turn their passion into productivity.</span><br/>

<div>
<p><i><b>The Details</b>:</i> The 3000 square foot facility will house different training components to help build better athletes. The first component will be the extended half court. The warehouse will be turned into a half-court with one stationary basketball hoop and up to two portable hoops depending on the nature of training taking place.</p>
<p>The remainder of the lower level will include a trainer's table, two cold tubs, turf, track and sand training ground, and workout equipment. This facility will be built with basketball as the focal point for all elements. All workout equipment to be placed in this facility is centred around the principles of building better basketball athletes. The training equipment on the lower level will include resistance training, squat racks, strength training and select free weights.</p>
<p>The upper level of the facility will include the remainder of the workout equipment; this area will be designated to sessions that are solely for performance training with personal trainers. The segregation is necessary to allow the free flow of athletes on the lower level, and the priority for the personal training on the upper.</p>
<p><b><i>How it will help</i></b>: The facility will provide an outlet for athletes to spend their time training in a productive manner. Membership fees will be kept to a minimum to allow easier accessibility, and the facility will be personal and basketball training only.</p>
<div>
<b><i>Training: </i></b>Different areas of the facility will be catered to different types of sports specific training. As mentioned above, the upper level will be catered to the personal training elements and the lower level will be accessible for the court use and free weights for memberships.<p></p>
<p><b><i>Memberships: </i></b>This will be the primary way to access the facility. There will be a drop in program, but only to allow proper utilization of the facility; drop in will fill the scheduling gaps. The facility will be driven by the athletes that are dedicated to their craft. The half-court facility designed to work on basketball specific training will provide the space needed for working on drills, footwork, etc. while the weight room portion will have all the tools necessary to round out the training accounting for strength training, cardio, resistance and more.</p>
<p><b><i>24/7: </i></b>The facility operates 24/7. This is intended for the facility to offer options to athletes and trainers alike. After hours sessions would have to be pre-booked and free-range access would only be granted to certain levels of membership.</p>

<p>Why? The reason we’re so passionate about the game is because it’s brought us where we are today. Basketball is our anchor among other things; it’s provided us a path to stay out of trouble as youth, a motivation to develop as athletes, opened doors for our education, and allowed us to become mentors to youth in our communities. For us it has opened a gateway of opportunities to impact our personal lives, the lives of others and the well-being of our community. The love for the game is real, even when our bodies won’t let us play we’ll still be involved in one way or another.</p>

Northern Alberta Basketball is an organization dedicated to developing high-level athletes and growing the game of basketball. NAB runs university-calibre summer leagues, tournaments & youth performance training programs.

We’re building a basketball facility to help develop the athletes of the future. The facility will be a haven for like-minded athletes that want to develop their game and believe in our motto to “eat, sleep, hoop”. 24/7, 365 athletes can gain access to this facility and this is our promise to build a better future for the game.



We’re building this facility to help athletes grow and provide them with resources that were not available to us. These athletes may love the game, but without guidance and a place to train they cannot develop their passion like others that have the resources in different parts of the world. In our city, other sports take precedence and we have select facilities with minimum availability to utilize for basketball. Our focus is the youth, our purpose is to build a platform that will afford them opportunities not readily available to us coming up in this city. We want to dedicate a space to the game we love, and allow the youth to turn their passion into productivity.




The Details: The 3000 square foot facility will house different training components to help build better athletes. The first component will be the extended half court. The warehouse will be turned into a half-court with one stationary basketball hoop and up to two portable hoops depending on the nature of training taking place.
The remainder of the lower level will include a trainer's table, two cold tubs, turf, track and sand training ground, and workout equipment. This facility will be built with basketball as the focal point for all elements. All workout equipment to be placed in this facility is centred around the principles of building better basketball athletes. The training equipment on the lower level will include resistance training, squat racks, strength training and select free weights.
The upper level of the facility will include the remainder of the workout equipment; this area will be designated to sessions that are solely for performance training with personal trainers. The segregation is necessary to allow the free flow of athletes on the lower level, and the priority for the personal training on the upper.
How it will help: The facility will provide an outlet for athletes to spend their time training in a productive manner. Membership fees will be kept to a minimum to allow easier accessibility, and the facility will be personal and basketball training only.

Training: Different areas of the facility will be catered to different types of sports specific training. As mentioned above, the upper level will be catered to the personal training elements and the lower level will be accessible for the court use and free weights for memberships.
Memberships: This will be the primary way to access the facility. There will be a drop in program, but only to allow proper utilization of the facility; drop in will fill the scheduling gaps. The facility will be driven by the athletes that are dedicated to their craft. The half-court facility designed to work on basketball specific training will provide the space needed for working on drills, footwork, etc. while the weight room portion will have all the tools necessary to round out the training accounting for strength training, cardio, resistance and more.
24/7: The facility operates 24/7. This is intended for the facility to offer options to athletes and trainers alike. After hours sessions would have to be pre-booked and free-range access would only be granted to certain levels of membership.


These are the 6 main pillars that we built our programs on, and they are meant to create outstanding athletes on and off the court.


Speed & Agility -We will help you maximize your athletic potential with components focused on speed and agility training. A quick first step is just as important as being able to d-up a quicker defender, we understand that and make it a priority in our athlete development.
Conditioning - Being able to play the game you love is a privilege, conditioning is what allows you to show the world what you can do. Maintaining an in-season level of conditioning year round will allow you to get more from your talents.
Power & Strength - Our strength programs are geared to allow athletes to develop more power in their game, whether your a big man or a point guard being able to hold your own is vital. We focus on growing athletic gains related to the sport.
Basketball IQ - The other half of the equation, your basketball IQ is what allows you to make reads on the court and put yourself and your team in a position to succeed. Our coaches focus on developing our athletes to understand the principles of the game.
Skills Development - The core of our program is to help athletes develop their foundation skills, whether that is mastering the fundamentals or perfecting their step-back jumper. We are focused on adding skills to their skill set and growing their strengths to build hard-working, all-around players.
Excellence - We focus our programs on athletes that want to achieve that level of excellence that will take them above and beyond their goals. Our programs are geared to challenge athletes to grow their skills, leadership and physical conditioning. It is our priority that we maintain a balance of the student-athlete relationship so we make sure our athletes are successful on both levels.

Welcome to the Indiegogo campaign for  <b>Unschooling The Kids. </b></p><p>We are Anthony and Lehla. Parents of three children. Identical twin girls, Olive and Amari 11, and a boy, Jahli, 8.</p>
<p>Did you ever think about your education, school and wonder how it could have been better, different?  If
you are a parent are you wondering which school is right for your child?  Are you anxious about what and how your
kids are learning?</p>
<p>These questions are very much out there and there
are almost as many answers as there are adults! Four things
stood out for us.</p>
<p><b>1.</b>  The really BIG questions that we had as our children began to grow up were,
""What is the best and most enjoyable way to learn?"" ""And what
exactly do our children need to be able to understand and what skills will be most useful in their world in 20 years from now?""</p>
<p><b>2. </b> Children seem to be having their childhoods made
shorter and shorter and these childhoods seem to resemble more and more 
the
adult lives all around them. Lives they ought to live when they are 
adults and not before. We didn't fancy that for our kids either. </p>
<p><b>3.</b>  We were not drawn to what we call at our house ""Parent
Slavery!"" (More of that in the book) </p><p><b>4.</b> The biggest 
challenge would be for...us the parents. The adults. The process of 
change had been stewing for a while and now we realized we had to take 
the plunge and follow an educational road less travelled.</p>
<p>This is why we are writing this book.</p>
<p>As we began our journey into schooling we started to question the very idea of
structured education and approaches to learning. Frankly it seemed to be
most effective way of driving healthy curiosity out of our children and encouraging
anxiety, depression and even mental health problems. </p>
<p>We witnessed teachers talking to children in ways
that we don't talk to each other in our home. Where was the respect? The
love? The variety of how children actually are as opposed to how they
ought to be?</p><p>As our highly active, restless, whole body learning children
approached ""problem child"" status in the UK system we realised what the next leg of our journey would be. It was to change what we were doing and pluck our kids out of a system that wasn't working for any of us.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1008278/files/20141112074902-Jahli.png?1415807342"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><div>
<p><b>UNSCHOOLING THE KIDS</b> is our best learning and insights from all of us in our
family (yes, the kids get their say too) over the last decade. </p>
<p>What we have
learned and done to try to find a way to tap the hugely creative, natural,
curious way of growing up and becoming confident human beings, that lies as
potential (so we believe) in all children.</p>
<p>To be an Unschooling family is to adopt a set of ideas and principles that
lie as a philosophy and understanding of how learning happens. How it rises from a deep
bottomless well of natural curiosity about absolutely everything. There are
core ideas and we have identified the key
6 aspects which seem important. See below.</p>
<p><b>1. Live in the Bigger Picture</b></p>
<p><b>2. Community</b></p>
<p><b>3. Play is the gateway</b></p>
<p><b>4. Embrace Everything</b></p>
<p><b>5. Creativity</b></p>
<p><b>6. To Live is To Learn</b></p>
<p><b>We are excited to get this book into
the world for a number of reasons.</b></p>
<p><b>1.  </b>We wish we had had a book like this to read! </p>
<p><b>2.  </b>We are connectors and want to be in touch with other
families, adults and kids who are interested in some of these ideas and hang
out together either literally, face to face, but at the least on <a href=""http://www.unschoolingthekids.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our blog</a>.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>  We are perhaps not typical of what most people tend to
think alternative educationalist are. We do not do it for reasons of religious
belief. We are not survivalists. We are not eco warriors, we do not shun
technology (but see the chapter in this in our book for our position on it) and
we are not yet very good at growing organic veggies. (Working on it!) We are
not drop outs or drop ins. We represent perhaps a group of people who are not
considered to be the ones mostly likely to chose Unschooling as a way of living
and learning. </p>
<p><b>4.</b>  Unschooling works and we now understand why it is compelling and a
wonderful way to spend those precious years with your children as they grow
into adults.</p>
<p><b>BOOK SPECS</b></p>
<p>The book is 260 pages. (the printed copy that is) and is approx 70,000
words. Lehla is working on illustrations and we have a first draft cover
design....see below</p>
<p>And you will be able to get it of course as a Kindle or E-Book and the usual
formats.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1008281/files/20141112075021-Ol.png?1415807421"" src="""" style=""width: 300px; height: 300px;""/></p>
<br/>
<div>
<p><b>So who is this book for?</b></p>
<p>Well we think pretty much anyone. But in particular, those of you who
 are already parents or soon to become parents. We do not advocate
 that everyone should
just chuck up their lives and take up Unschooling. But some of the 
principles
of this approach will certainly be useful in enhancing your own family 
life. </p>
<p><b>And younger people... </b>This book may interest you if only so you can
tell us what you think we missed or could add? Or we would love to know what you think about how you
would like your learning life to be different?</p>
<p><b>If you are interested in the book then one tip we do have. </b></p>
<p>Get a few copies of the book and share it with those close to you. It will
make for a lively debate and at least if you do start adopting some Unschooling
principles, those close to you will know what you are on about when they see
your son driving the car sitting on a cushion (no, that's a joke we do not
advocate underage driving!)</p>
<p>So, please do help us bring <b>Unschooling the Kids</b> to a finished published
project by contributing to this campaign, sharing it with friends or talking
about and sharing it on your social media platforms.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the Indiegogo campaign for  Unschooling The Kids. We are Anthony and Lehla. Parents of three children. Identical twin girls, Olive and Amari 11, and a boy, Jahli, 8.
Did you ever think about your education, school and wonder how it could have been better, different?  If
you are a parent are you wondering which school is right for your child?  Are you anxious about what and how your
kids are learning?
These questions are very much out there and there
are almost as many answers as there are adults! Four things
stood out for us.
1.  The really BIG questions that we had as our children began to grow up were,
""What is the best and most enjoyable way to learn?"" ""And what
exactly do our children need to be able to understand and what skills will be most useful in their world in 20 years from now?""
2.  Children seem to be having their childhoods made
shorter and shorter and these childhoods seem to resemble more and more 
the
adult lives all around them. Lives they ought to live when they are 
adults and not before. We didn't fancy that for our kids either. 
3.  We were not drawn to what we call at our house ""Parent
Slavery!"" (More of that in the book) 4. The biggest 
challenge would be for...us the parents. The adults. The process of 
change had been stewing for a while and now we realized we had to take 
the plunge and follow an educational road less travelled.
This is why we are writing this book.
As we began our journey into schooling we started to question the very idea of
structured education and approaches to learning. Frankly it seemed to be
most effective way of driving healthy curiosity out of our children and encouraging
anxiety, depression and even mental health problems. 
We witnessed teachers talking to children in ways
that we don't talk to each other in our home. Where was the respect? The
love? The variety of how children actually are as opposed to how they
ought to be?As our highly active, restless, whole body learning children
approached ""problem child"" status in the UK system we realised what the next leg of our journey would be. It was to change what we were doing and pluck our kids out of a system that wasn't working for any of us.
UNSCHOOLING THE KIDS is our best learning and insights from all of us in our
family (yes, the kids get their say too) over the last decade. 
What we have
learned and done to try to find a way to tap the hugely creative, natural,
curious way of growing up and becoming confident human beings, that lies as
potential (so we believe) in all children.
To be an Unschooling family is to adopt a set of ideas and principles that
lie as a philosophy and understanding of how learning happens. How it rises from a deep
bottomless well of natural curiosity about absolutely everything. There are
core ideas and we have identified the key
6 aspects which seem important. See below.
1. Live in the Bigger Picture
2. Community
3. Play is the gateway
4. Embrace Everything
5. Creativity
6. To Live is To Learn
We are excited to get this book into
the world for a number of reasons.
1.  We wish we had had a book like this to read! 
2.  We are connectors and want to be in touch with other
families, adults and kids who are interested in some of these ideas and hang
out together either literally, face to face, but at the least on our blog.
3.  We are perhaps not typical of what most people tend to
think alternative educationalist are. We do not do it for reasons of religious
belief. We are not survivalists. We are not eco warriors, we do not shun
technology (but see the chapter in this in our book for our position on it) and
we are not yet very good at growing organic veggies. (Working on it!) We are
not drop outs or drop ins. We represent perhaps a group of people who are not
considered to be the ones mostly likely to chose Unschooling as a way of living
and learning. 
4.  Unschooling works and we now understand why it is compelling and a
wonderful way to spend those precious years with your children as they grow
into adults.
BOOK SPECS
The book is 260 pages. (the printed copy that is) and is approx 70,000
words. Lehla is working on illustrations and we have a first draft cover
design....see below
And you will be able to get it of course as a Kindle or E-Book and the usual
formats.




So who is this book for?
Well we think pretty much anyone. But in particular, those of you who
 are already parents or soon to become parents. We do not advocate
 that everyone should
just chuck up their lives and take up Unschooling. But some of the 
principles
of this approach will certainly be useful in enhancing your own family 
life. 
And younger people... This book may interest you if only so you can
tell us what you think we missed or could add? Or we would love to know what you think about how you
would like your learning life to be different?
If you are interested in the book then one tip we do have. 
Get a few copies of the book and share it with those close to you. It will
make for a lively debate and at least if you do start adopting some Unschooling
principles, those close to you will know what you are on about when they see
your son driving the car sitting on a cushion (no, that's a joke we do not
advocate underage driving!)
So, please do help us bring Unschooling the Kids to a finished published
project by contributing to this campaign, sharing it with friends or talking
about and sharing it on your social media platforms.

You can support us for as little as £4 / $6 ( see rewards on the right)
Here are details about some of the more juicy rewards...
£45 - level backers ( and other rewards packages with T Shirts ) get a COOL COTTON T SHIRT printed with your choice of any illustration from the book or from our designed range.
We
 have got into making our own T Shirts and we have a small range that 
have been designed by us all in the family. So you can get a T Shirt for
 an adult, you or a partner, or friend or family member -  a grown up 
one or one for the kids. Designed by our kids or the the adults.
If you like Lehla's Illustrations then they go well on a T shirt too!
If
 you go for any of the rewards options with a T Shirt then we will be in
 touch straight away and work with you to decide which one you want us 
to create and send you. Here are some samples below.





£60- Reward backers get limited edition signed illustrations 
by Lehla. These are themed around key points in the book. Their main use
 (apart from being lovely to look at) is to be a structure to support 
you to remember an idea or a principle.
Our brains like cues to remind us of things and this is one way you can have your own copy of one of the ones we use at home.
£130 backers get a 90 minute (hour and a half) conference skype call with us both.
You
 can use this time we have together to ask us anything you want as well 
as pick our brains. We will assist you in finding out more or we will help you do your best to make some decisions that you might be 
wrestling with.
As you might have read, Anthony is a professional 
coach and Lehla has some very acute 
coaching skills so expect to have a powerful and insightful session.
And included are 2 copies of the BOOK and the E - BOOK
£450 backers get
 to bring either Anthony or Lehla out to wherever you are in Europe to 
run a half day workshop based on our insights in Unschooling the Kids. 
This
 is a great option for any group of people, maybe a few families or a 
learning club, parents group, even schools and colleges to dig into the 
ideas in our book and see how some of them play out in a workshop 
environment. 
Please get in touch before you chose this option so we can talk it through and make sure we can set it up together.
No
 matter how much you contribute, we will list your name as a wonderful 
supporter in the back of the e-book and on our blog website.

Stretch Rewards
If this campaign earns more than its £6000 goal, then we will have enough funds to do some more very exciting things....
If we get to £8,000 there will be an Audio Book. We will make it available to all our campaign supporters from Kickstarter.
If we get to £10,000: We will have a Conference!
We really want to meet you and others intersted in the future of 
learning for our children. So if we have the extra funds we will book 
the venue and use it to launch the first ever UNSCHOOLING THE KIDS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE. We will get the most inspiring, speakers and workshop leaders. 
We will hold it in Italy near Assisi (Yup, as in St Francis) and have a great inspiring and informative time.
(If you want to be kept up to date on this conference idea please email me at anthony@unschoolingthekids.com)
If we get to this £10,000 target all campaign supporters who have 
taken any of the rewards above £60 or upwards will get discounted

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<div>
<p>The
grassroots health movement that has become Daily Fit Log organically grew from
the head and heart of physical education teacher and lifestyle enthusiast,
Timothy Palek. </p>

Armed with an idea, a BS in Kinesiology and a
Masters in Health and Physical Education from James Madison University, Tim set
out on a journey - not to force students to exercise within the walls of the
school gymnasium, but to ingrain pivotal and lasting behavioral changes through
the power of pairing education with technology.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1005858/files/20141111125642-_jfh8180.jpg?1415739402"" src="""" style=""width: 573.91959798995px; height: 405px;""/></p>

School budgets for
health and physical education are shrinking


Technology is vital for
students to learn in today’s education system – fitness technology can cost
upwards of $1,000/school + annual fees


23 million children in the
United States are overweight or obese, putting them at risk to potentially
life-threatening diseases


Childhood obesity is
crippling our country's youth and schools need new innovative ways to tackle
the issue


Daily Fit Log addresses
students’ health and wellness habits, encourages students to be more active,
and does so for FREE


Students use DFL’s
educational technology to record physical activity, enter health data, track
fitness testing scores, set goals, create personal fitness plans, and most
importantly, become educated on how to achieve and maintain a healthy
and physically active lifestyle


Teachers use the real time
data to help students gain a greater awareness around their physical health and
improve their fitness habitudes


Our Story

The
grassroots health movement that has become Daily Fit Log organically grew from
the head and heart of physical education teacher and lifestyle enthusiast,
Timothy Palek. 

Armed with an idea, a BS in Kinesiology and a
Masters in Health and Physical Education from James Madison University, Tim set
out on a journey - not to force students to exercise within the walls of the
school gymnasium, but to ingrain pivotal and lasting behavioral changes through
the power of pairing education with technology.
This journey
has led Tim and his three childhood friends to co-found, self-fund, and release
the Daily Fit Log platform to schools across the United States.

Today, Daily Fit Log has over 500 registered schools
across 39 states – powered by 1,000+ teachers who are making a daily impact on
the health and wellness of the 100,000+ students on DailyFitLog.com. 


Your contribution will enhance health and physical education to combat childhood
obesity in the United States AND help grow our life-changing technology to reach all 50 million students across the country, in both affluent and economically
disadvantaged schools.


America's Problem to Solve: Childhood Obesity
 








Obese youth are more likely to have risk factors
for cardiovascular disease, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure.


Children and adolescents who are obese are at
greater risk for bone and joint problems, sleep apnea, and social and
psychological problems such as stigmatization and poor self-esteem.


Obesity is associated with
increased risk for many types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, colon,
endometrium, esophagus, kidney, pancreas, gall bladder, thyroid, ovary, cervix,
and prostate, as well as multiple myeloma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Children and adolescents who are obese are likely to be obese as adults.



100,000 K-12 SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES NEED WAYS TO ADDRESS OBESITY WITH 50
MILLION 21ST CENTURY LEARNERS 

At a time when school budgets are shrinking and
teachers are forced to do more with less, physical
education tracking technology would cost our education system over $100 million in upfront licensing costs, renewal fees, tech support, training and hosting
for every school in the country to use this technology. 


DailyFitLog.com: Helps Combat Childhood Obesity


To help solve this national epidemic, Daily Fit Log offers a FREE, web-based health and physical education platform that improves fitness, health and wellness for American children. Free is not just an introductory price or a hook, it’s the backbone of what we do at Daily Fit Log.








Created by a teacher, for teachers, DFL’s full educational
platform offers schools multiple features that work simultaneously with one
another – creating a complete educational experience for students. Without
DFL’s technology, many teachers are only able to re-create small portions of
what the program can do, thus delivering a fraction of what students need in
order to learn important lifetime fitness concepts.


Daily Fit Log provides a cohesive series of
features which synchronize to create a fitness experience that includes
tracking, self-assessment, goal setting, and personal fitness planning –
teaching students the necessary skills to promote health and wellness for a
lifetime of daily physical activity.

What We Need


Every $100 contributed = FREE access to our cloud-based software, tech support, training, and hosting for an entire school.


In 2014 we
saw tremendous growth on the DFL platform by reaching 500 registered schools and more than doubling our user base to 100,000+ students. 
With 100,000 public schools and 50 million students in the United States, we have only scratched the surface in providing schools access to our platform. With a price of FREE and our grassroots approach to marketing, we look to outperform growth from 2014 and reach 250,000 students by the end of 2015. 
In order to reach our goal, we estimate that we need $50,000 (20 cents per student or $100 per school) – this will pay for access to our cloud-based software, (including tech support, training and hosting), increased operating and engineering costs to reach and maintain 250,000 students, and fulfillment of IndieGogo perks. 
If you want to practice some math, here is how the numbers breakdown: 


Avg. U.S. public school has 500 students (100 million students/100k schools)
To onboard and maintain 250,000 students, we need $50,000
Each student costs DFL roughly 20 cents ($50,000/250,000 students)
With avg. school enrollment of 500 students, $100 supports one school

Long-Term Goals:

$75,000 raised allows DFL to exhibit at the Shape America National Convention for Health & Physical Education in Seattle, WA (March 2015). 
$150,000 allows us to complete development and release a mobile app for iOS & Android!

The conference last year wrecked me and I’ll never be the same.”  - Temi O.“God used BCF to lead me to Him. It is in this ministry that I first caught a glimpse of what it meant to be on fire for God. It remains the ministry that gives me the desire to delve deeper spiritually in order to maintain an engaging, loving, experiential relationship with the Lord.”- Victoria P.“BCF means everything to me. It has truly allowed me to understand what it means to walk with Christ through fellowship with other young believers. My walk has been forever changed because of it.”- Jamal N.“BCF was the catalyst for me to experience a relationship with God and His people in a  new and awesome way. BCF showed me Christ in a way no one else has before.”-Janicia M.“BCF has been a catalyst for spiritual growth in my life. God has used so many different people in the ministry to build my faith, broaden my understanding of God, challenge me to continue learning,and so much more. Being a part of BCF has showed me time and time again, that God is real and that He changes lives for the better.”- Idara I“BCF showed me what true friendship looked like.""- Lu A",1.0,0,"21 Campaigns

As we develop new workshop material we need two things. 1) A great audience so that we can feel out the best/worst parts of the workshop and tweak as necessary 2) Practice delivering the workshops before we release them into our formal portfolio. To that end you get a great bargain, we get to practice and put our workshops to test in the real world, and get access to a much broader audience of friendly folks than we'd get to meet in our full-price workshops. We realize not everyone can afford to pay $15k for our workshops, and this is one way we can make the same workshop accessible to anyone.</p><p><b>What/Where Is The VIP Event?:</b> The VIP Event will be immediately following the workshop and held at Elasticity (see Update for details). It's less than 1/2 mile away so an easy walk from the workshop venue. We already have some great options on the table so it's going to be a blast. We'll update as we go along. One thing that never changes is that we limit the VIP attendees to 20-30 people max. We want a bit of intimacy and to get to know everyone, that's difficult to do if you get many more people than that together. You will most certainly get your moneys worth with a VIP ticket.</p><p><b>Who Is SideraWorks?: </b>SideraWorks is a management consultancy focused on helping organizations transform themselves for the next generation. We have a very tight focus on collaboration and education, specifically to tackle the disruption and impact that social media has brought about. It was founded by Matt Ridings &amp; Amber Naslund. Between the two of them they've spoken in front of hundreds of thousands people in audiences around the world, have a best-selling business book on social business, have founded, run, and advised multiple successful ventures over the years and consulted to major brands such as Levi's, Cisco, IBM, British Airways, CDW, and many, many more. Their client workshops are renowned for their interactivity, fun, and depth of engagement and learning. Periodically those workshops are available to the public either through partnerships with conferences or when testing new material.</p><p></p><p></p>

""Matt and Amber are one step ahead of the rest of the pack. They are taking​ 'social thinking' to the next logical step for an enterprise. I sincerely believe their holistic approach can translate into competitive advantage."" ~ Mark Schaefer, Rutgers University Faculty, Author of Return On Influence""If you want to get below the buzzwords of social business you Better Call SideraWorks! Matt and Amber get it and can help your organization transform its business model with social at the core where it should be."" ~Saul Kaplan, Chief Catalyst & Founder, Business Innovation Factory""So many people talk at me. Fewer make me think. And it's the rare occasion that I'm challenged and enchanted. My friends at SideraWorks are rare ones. That's why I'm honored they're in my small circle of trusted advisors."" ~Louis Richardson, Social Business & Smarter Workforce, IBM""You know that saying, ""Those who can't do, teach?"" It's completely wrong, of course. In truth: People who know their material cold are both teachers and do-ers. That's Matt and Amber.  I've hired them many times to present to our audience of marketers. And I always come away with a renewed appreciation for how they can explain complex issues simply and succinctly, and how they empower their audience, not overwhelm them.  That's not a small thing, and it speaks to the depth and breadth of their knowledge as well as their energy for an often misunderstood (and mis-used) category."" ~Ann Handley, Chief Content Officer, MarketingProfs""If I wanted to recommend a team to help my clients create a true social business these are the guys I would call"" ~Paul Higgins, Emergent FuturesPlatinum Sponsor: CrowdSource
CrowdSource is the industry leader in a multi-billion dollar market, providing clients with on-demand access to a skilled and scalable workforce. We manage crowd-based talent to deliver content, moderation and transcription solutions to enterprise clients worldwide.

An amazing venue and we can't thank them enough. Go check out some of the images, get impressed, and give them your business!Gold Sponsor & VIP Event Venue: Elasticity Elasticity is a leading national digital marketing and public relations agency that works with brands including Charter Communications, H&R Block, CafePress, Capital One, Best Buy, SunEdison, and entrepreneurial startup ecosystems. In addition, they are just a great group of people who went out of their way to help bring this event together.Gold Sponsor: UMSL
Check out the new Programs and Certifications in Digital and Social Media Marketing at the University of Missouri – St. Louis. We're thrilled to have them board as a sponsor!Adamantium Sponsor: TBD, This could be you!FAQ:Why Is This So Inexpensive?: Great question. As we develop new workshop material we need two things. 1) A great audience so that we can feel out the best/worst parts of the workshop and tweak as necessary 2) Practice delivering the workshops before we release them into our formal portfolio. To that end you get a great bargain, we get to practice and put our workshops to test in the real world, and get access to a much broader audience of friendly folks than we'd get to meet in our full-price workshops. We realize not everyone can afford to pay $15k for our workshops, and this is one way we can make the same workshop accessible to anyone.What/Where Is The VIP Event?: The VIP Event will be immediately following the workshop and held at Elasticity (see Update for details). It's less than 1/2 mile away so an easy walk from the workshop venue. We already have some great options on the table so it's going to be a blast. We'll update as we go along. One thing that never changes is that we limit the VIP attendees to 20-30 people max. We want a bit of intimacy and to get to know everyone, that's difficult to do if you get many more people than that together. You will most certainly get your moneys worth with a VIP ticket.Who Is SideraWorks?: SideraWorks is a management consultancy focused on helping organizations transform themselves for the next generation. We have a very tight focus on collaboration and education, specifically to tackle the disruption and impact that social media has brought about. It was founded by Matt Ridings & Amber Naslund.

Their client workshops are renowned for their interactivity, fun, and depth of engagement and learning. Periodically those workshops are available to the public either through partnerships with conferences or when testing new material.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Jennifer Wolfe is an amazing teacher at Emerson Junior High in Davis, California. She has nurtured and taught hundreds of our children. And she is passionate about furthering the education of Nicaraguan kids, too.  A group of Jennifer’s former students and their parents are raising funds to send Jennifer back to Nicaragua in summer of 2013 to help construct another school -- she will lay bricks, mix cement and build that school!</h3>
<h3>The funds raised help pay for the school including the rebar, wiring, plumbing, bricks and so on as well as Jennifer’s housing and travel.  Please help by donating $5 or $10 or $500!  Many small donations make the goal light!  If you want to give Jennifer an end of the school year gift, please donate to her dream of helping to build another school.  If you cannot contribute money, that's ok!  We hope to send Jennifer with duffle bags full of new or gently used school backpacks, new pencils, children's Spanish reading books, and gently used laptops.  You can also help at our car washes in Davis on June 1 and June 29 to raise more funds.</h3>
<h3>What is Seeds of Learning or ""SOL""?</h3>
<h3>Watch the video at <a href=""http://www.seedsoflearning.org/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.seedsoflearning.org/index.php </a>and you will understand Jennifer’s love of this non-profit. Seeds of Learning or ""SOL"" is a small but mighty non-profit whose sole mission is to further education in Nicaragua. Since its inception in 1991, SOL has constructed or remodeled 152 classrooms in 55 communities in Nicaragua. After a school is built, SOL matches the school in Nicaragua with a sister school in the United States. Jennifer’s class is the sister school with a very small rural elementary school that Jennifer helped build.

Jennifer’s students continue to write to the students in Nicaragua. The strong bonds between our communities will be life long because of Jennifer and others like her.</h3>
<h2>What We Need!</h2>
<h3>For Jennifer to go to Nicaragua to help build another school, we want to raise: $2900 for the program and $600 for her plane flight for a total of $3,500. As the writer of this Indiegogo campaign, I am now supposed to tell you about any unique perks I can offer you if you participate. But all I can offer is the wonderful feeling that you are contributing to the education of kids for years to come. You are contributing to sending a teacher to help instruct students and excite them about learning! If you cannot go with Jennifer on this journey, please help fund her passion in your name. SOL is a non-profit so your donation is tax deductible. If we do not raise the full $3,500, all the funds we do raise will go toward sending Jennifer to Nicaragua in 2013. We will supplement those funds with as many car washes and bake sales as necessary until we get her back to SOL!</h3>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<h3>Your contribution can be $5, $25, $100 or $500. Or it can be a gently used child's backpack, some children's reading books in Spanish or a gently used laptop. Whatever your contribution, know you are making a big difference. The kids in Nicaragua often walk hours to get to school and back home each day. They have few opportunities without an education. Through SOL, Jennifer can help children for years to come learn, thrive and be the best they can be. Like the sun or SOL, kids in Nicaragua can shine thanks to your support. Email me at jenny@outdoorkids.com if you want me to pick up your donations or drop them off at Jennifer’s classroom at Emerson.</h3>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<h3>If you cannot contribute with a financial donation, that's ok!</h3>
<h3>• Can you donate items for Jennifer to take with her? She will take new or gently used backpacks; used laptops; new school supplies especially pencils and notebooks; or children's Spanish reading books.</h3>
<h3>• Post this notice on your Facebook account or email friends and family members to let them know about SOL and Jennifer’s goal.</h3>
<h3>• Help at our car washes! The dates are June 1 and 29th</h3>
<h3>• Wish her luck. Your thoughts and support are priceless!</h3></div>","Jennifer Wolfe and Nicaragua

Your contribution can be $5, $25, $100 or $500. Or it can be a gently used child's backpack, some children's reading books in Spanish or a gently used laptop. Whatever your contribution, know you are making a big difference. The kids in Nicaragua often walk hours to get to school and back home each day. They have few opportunities without an education. Through SOL, Jennifer can help children for years to come learn, thrive and be the best they can be. Like the sun or SOL, kids in Nicaragua can shine thanks to your support. Email me at jenny@outdoorkids.com if you want me to pick up your donations or drop them off at Jennifer’s classroom at Emerson.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute with a financial donation, that's ok!
• Can you donate items for Jennifer to take with her? She will take new or gently used backpacks; used laptops; new school supplies especially pencils and notebooks; or children's Spanish reading books.
• Post this notice on your Facebook account or email friends and family members to let them know about SOL and Jennifer’s goal.
• Help at our car washes! The dates are June 1 and 29th
• Wish her luck. Your thoughts and support are priceless!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</tr></tbody></table><h2>In past years ATOP Team Members traveled to Kenya, Rwanda and DR Congo.  This year the trip will be repeated, but we need your help...</h2>
<h2>In 2012, ATOP members spent weeks, healing and spreading peace among trauma survivors.  This year will be no different.</h2>
<h2>NAIROBI, KENYA 2012</h2>
<p>The ATOP Team began working in Nairobi, Kenya, with the following groups that partner with Benjamin Mwenda, Managing Director of <strong>Youth Volunteer for Chang</strong>e:</p>
<p><br/>1. We worked with the Kwangware Women’s Group. In the largest slum of Africa, about 20 women gathered to share their experiences, stresses of life, and issues with the extreme alcoholism of their spouses. Participants engaged in energetic healing and were given tools for everyday survival and ways to engage in approaching the addiction issue as a disease, as a <br/>social outcome of unemployment, and as a cultural resignation for not being able to provide for their families. The women reported that they benefited greatly from the new tools and wereinvigorated with energetic balance. They shared how they will continue meeting even after the ATOP Team’s departure. Garments and rings were given to the participants as tokens of <br/>gratitude, acknowledgment, and love.</p>
<p><br/>2. We then worked with the Kibera Small Business Women’s Group, also in the slum area. Here 25 participants were given leadership skills and stress-reduction mindfulness breathing exercises, as well as Reiki energetic healing. The women said that they learned not to keep <br/>angry and aggressive thoughts or deeds to themselves. They also learned to process their feelings peacefully, release their anger and revenge, and transform their anger through forgiveness. One woman said, “I was fighting with my coworker before this training, and the entire time during the training I was thinking of going back and continuing the fight. But now that I learned a healthier way, through emotional intelligence, I am going to let go and practice forgiveness.”</p>
<p><br/>3. We then moved to the children’s group, where 75 children were gathered and excited to greet the ATOP Team. The Four Agreements were shared to provide a framework for how to live a stress-free life, as was Martin Luther King’s Non-Violent Communication (NVC) for preventing conflicts. In addition, energetic healing, yoga, and chakra balancing exercises were taught in combination with ethnic songs and dance, which they said was very fun and a learning process.</p>
<p><br/>4. We then worked with the Kibera Youth Volunteers for Change. This was another lively workshop of 25 young people ages 17 to 29. The Four Agreements, life processing, and emotional intelligence were shared, and NVC was reviewed and applied to their challenging personal cases. One of the cases that resonated with all the participants was how to deal with a <br/>friend who tries to take your girlfriend. This session was followed by meditation and mindfulness breathing techniques.</p>
<p><br/>5. A two-day training was given in Mathare, also in the slum area, to 22 former gang members. Here developing emotional intelligence and NVC were shared as well as the importance of the circle of dialogue.</p>
<p><br/>6. On July 1 the ATOP Team took part in the Maranatha Church services in Kwangware, a Pentecostal Church, and both team members gave sermons on love, forgiveness, and restorative vision of justice to over 700 congregation members.</p>
<p><br/>7. The ATOP Team worked with Karika aging group in Kawangare (the slums), where more than 90 women and men (ages 60 to 90) gathered to learn mindfulness and breath exercises for health, reducing blood pressure, and reducing physical pain. The motto was “old is gold.” A generational group was recommended as well as essential oils and an ongoing practice of limbic <br/>breath. After the workshop the aged attendees shared that they felt much better, experiencing less physical pain, more inner peace, and more meaning in life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8. On July 2, partnering with Bikundo Onyari, CEO of aNDE Kenya, we held a workshop with lawyers, paralegals, and prison warders in Halinguni. More than 25 attorneys, paralegals, and other prison personnel gathered with eagerness and insight to better their lives. Participants shared that <br/>this was the most helpful training they had ever experienced, in which all of the teachings were in line with their needs, such as how to manage anger in themselves and in those they work with, how to let go and practice forgiveness, and how to open their energy centers for optimum health and <br/>flow of vital energy – especially the throat and the heart centers to also alleviate the hypothyroidism and heart palpitations that were often expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>9. The ATOP Team was invited by the Office of the Vice-Chancellor and the Dean and the Chair of the Psychology Department to give a workshop at the University of Nairobi. More than 135 4 students, faculty, and staff gathered and had a transformative experiential session that revealed what trauma does in the body, mind, emotions, and spirit, as well as the restorative <br/>ways to cope with it. Although at first they were uncomfortable with physical expressions of love, at the end of the workshop they were exhibiting such transformative behavior and did not leave the auditorium without hugging and giving one another their unconditional love and regard. Future collaborative plans were made for the following year for longer all-day <br/>workshops. Dr. Kariuki, the Chairperson of the Psychology Department said: “It was our joy and pleasure to have met your team. Many thanks for reassuring us and our students that indeed forgiveness, reconciliation and resilience are possible and that each one of us has a role to play. We hope that we can work out longer collaboration and linkages in workshops and <br/>seminars in order to fully participate in the healing of our world.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10. At the Rosa Mystical Center, partnering with Eunice Olawo, Director of MA-Counseling Studies, the ATOP Team was invited to conduct a workshop especially for psychologists, counselors, directors of counseling centers, and mental health professionals. The Seven-Step Integrative Model was shared and practiced, the theoretical rationale and foundation were elaborated upon, an in-depth discussion took place, an introduction to restorative justice and<br/>ways to enhance the work of mental health professionals was presented, and essential oils from Young and Living were introduced and applied for ultimate grounding. This was followed by the experiential session in open nature, the Center’s garden. Participants shared that although they never thought they would resume positions as “secret prayer” and the “worrier pose,” they felt so much lighter, happier, more grounded, and loving. Their backaches and <br/>shoulder pains melted away with their positive affirmation and movements.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Kigali, Rwanda</strong></h2>
<p><br/>Our mission to Rwanda took place in collaboration with Aloys Ntezimana, Director of the NGO Self-Employed Youth Organization (SEYO), and Steven Shyaka, Mentee of the <br/>Strongest Oak in Kigali. On 4th of July, the ATOP Team met with Nyilinhwaya Faustin, the Minister of Gender and Family Promotion in Rwanda. Although it was a national holiday –<br/>Independence Day for Rwanda, a date it shares with the U.S. Independence Day – and all offices were closed, he made a special effort to open his office for our team. He presented us with an update of women’s issues and he elaborated on the recent improvements in gender issues such as the minimum of 50 percent of women required in the parliament. He also shared the <br/>ongoing challenges, such as national policy against gender violence, high levels of gender-based violence (GBV), limited knowledge of laws by women, persistence of some negative cultural beliefs such as female genital mutilation (FGM) – which they don’t acknowledge as mutilation because they don’t cut the clitoris but rather stretch both labia for what they believe is the <br/>ultimate pleasure for both men and women – as well as rapes of domestic workers. He also emphasized their commitment to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG)-3, <br/>which aims to promote gender equality and empower women while seeking to eradicate gender-based violence, which is an impediment to gender equality and sustainable development. He also emphasized the need for psychological support and ended by inviting our team to conduct workshops in collaboration with his office. </p>
<p>The next day we conducted a workshop at the Youth Employment Generation office in Nyagatare, which is affiliated with the Rwanda Minister of Youth and engages in reproductive <br/>health, HIV education, sewing and other vocational trainings, and nurturing entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The goals of this agency are peacebuilding, patriotism, national reconciliation, and sustainable development. We had more than 100 participants. Unfortunately, 44.9 percent Rwandese are <br/>living below the poverty line, and the majority are young people. Principles of conflict transformation, emotional intelligence, forgiveness, and restorative justice were introduced <br/>and reinforced, and this was followed by chakra balancing, energetic healing exercises, essential oils, and Bach flower remedies. Attendees were given bookmarks with non-violent <br/>communication (NVC) messages, as well as earrings. We then were transported via motorcycles to the Youth Business Center. There were 48 men and women attending this workshop, and we <br/>shared the Seven Habits of Highly Effective Leaders (Steven Covey, 1998), emotional intelligence, work ethics, and values. The team was joined by Michele Merkel, MS, and Stu Merkel, MPH, MBA; their contribution was extremely valuable, especially because of the addition of the male perspective in leadership.</p>
<h2>DR CONGO</h2>
<p>Few countries have seen the amount of violence that the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has seen in the past decades. Since 1996 the fourth largest African state has seen wars with its neighbors, civil wars, and other forms of violence that have proliferated immense poverty and famine, an AIDS/HIV epidemic, increasing rape rates and gender intolerance. The International Rescue Committee estimated that over 5.4 million people have died from the prolonged conflict, that Nicholas D. Kristof of the New York Times says is being “ignored” by the international community. The vicious cycle of hate and fear seems almost unbreakable for the citizens of the DRC.</p>
<p>Our organization,　The Association for Trauma Outreach &amp; Prevention　(ATOP) of Meaningful World, a New York based international organization affiliated with DPI of the United Nations, devoted to fostering a, just, peaceful, and meaningful world, has collaborated with many organizations to bring rehabilitation programs to Sierra Leone in March of 2009, and over 29 other humanitarian empowerment, educational, and rehabilitation programs around the world including Haiti. Our mission to DR Congo will focus on the city of Bukavu, home to nearly half a million people, including 500 displaced children. We are collaborating with the Peace Center there, as well as Université de la Paix, refugee centers, and hospitals in the area. We will be working with vulnerable groups of children, women who were raped in the war, refugees and older adults. We have the experience and expertise to make a difference. ATOP team members that will be traveling to Congo are: Dr. Ani Kalayjian – Founder and President of ATOP. Dr. Kalayjian has devoted her life to bringing healing to those who have survived the devastation of disaster. Dr Isidore A. Udoh is a postdoctoral fellow at the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University, and Jennifer De Mucci – Vice President of ATOP, holds a Master’s degree in psychology.</p>
<p>Our goals are to help survivors heal their emotional and psychospiritual wounds resulting from years of armed conflict, poverty, discrimination, and displacement. We aim to help surviving communities understand the impact of the past on their present through education, healing groups, and self-healing. We will train psychologist, social workers, nurses and other health care practitioners. This helps create educated and healthy communities that are able to transform generationally transmitted trauma by cultivating a new world view, train and educate high school teachers and students to nurture non-violence in their respective communities, and foster communal dialogue for conflict transformation and peace-building through practicing forgiveness. We also plan to help mobilize communities, facilitating healthy partnerships that build bridges of diversity through common values centered on the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

NAIROBI, KENYA 2012
The ATOP Team began working in Nairobi, Kenya, with the following groups that partner with Benjamin Mwenda, Managing Director of Youth Volunteer for Change:
1. We worked with the Kwangware Women’s Group. In the largest slum of Africa, about 20 women gathered to share their experiences, stresses of life, and issues with the extreme alcoholism of their spouses. Participants engaged in energetic healing and were given tools for everyday survival and ways to engage in approaching the addiction issue as a disease, as a social outcome of unemployment, and as a cultural resignation for not being able to provide for their families. The women reported that they benefited greatly from the new tools and wereinvigorated with energetic balance. They shared how they will continue meeting even after the ATOP Team’s departure. Garments and rings were given to the participants as tokens of gratitude, acknowledgment, and love.
2. We then worked with the Kibera Small Business Women’s Group, also in the slum area. Here 25 participants were given leadership skills and stress-reduction mindfulness breathing exercises, as well as Reiki energetic healing. The women said that they learned not to keep angry and aggressive thoughts or deeds to themselves. They also learned to process their feelings peacefully, release their anger and revenge, and transform their anger through forgiveness. One woman said, “I was fighting with my coworker before this training, and the entire time during the training I was thinking of going back and continuing the fight. But now that I learned a healthier way, through emotional intelligence, I am going to let go and practice forgiveness.”

6. On July 1 the ATOP Team took part in the Maranatha Church services in Kwangware, a Pentecostal Church, and both team members gave sermons on love, forgiveness, and restorative vision of justice to over 700 congregation members.
7. The ATOP Team worked with Karika aging group in Kawangare (the slums), where more than 90 women and men (ages 60 to 90) gathered to learn mindfulness and breath exercises for health, reducing blood pressure, and reducing physical pain. The motto was “old is gold.” A generational group was recommended as well as essential oils and an ongoing practice of limbic breath.

Kigali, Rwanda
Our mission to Rwanda took place in collaboration with Aloys Ntezimana, Director of the NGO Self-Employed Youth Organization (SEYO), and Steven Shyaka, Mentee of the Strongest Oak in Kigali. On 4th of July, the ATOP Team met with Nyilinhwaya Faustin, the Minister of Gender and Family Promotion in Rwanda. Although it was a national holiday –Independence Day for Rwanda, a date it shares with the U.S. Independence Day – and all offices were closed, he made a special effort to open his office for our team. He presented us with an update of women’s issues and he elaborated on the recent improvements in gender issues such as the minimum of 50 percent of women required in the parliament. He also shared the ongoing challenges, such as national policy against gender violence, high levels of gender-based violence (GBV), limited knowledge of laws by women, persistence of some negative cultural beliefs such as female genital mutilation (FGM) – which they don’t acknowledge as mutilation because they don’t cut the clitoris but rather stretch both labia for what they believe is the ultimate pleasure for both men and women – as well as rapes of domestic workers.

He also emphasized the need for psychological support and ended by inviting our team to conduct workshops in collaboration with his office. 
The next day we conducted a workshop at the Youth Employment Generation office in Nyagatare, which is affiliated with the Rwanda Minister of Youth and engages in reproductive health, HIV education, sewing and other vocational trainings, and nurturing entrepreneurship.
The goals of this agency are peacebuilding, patriotism, national reconciliation, and sustainable development. We had more than 100 participants. Unfortunately, 44.9 percent Rwandese are living below the poverty line, and the majority are young people. Principles of conflict transformation, emotional intelligence, forgiveness, and restorative justice were introduced and reinforced, and this was followed by chakra balancing, energetic healing exercises, essential oils, and Bach flower remedies. Attendees were given bookmarks with non-violent communication (NVC) messages, as well as earrings. We then were transported via motorcycles to the Youth Business Center. There were 48 men and women attending this workshop, and we shared the Seven Habits of Highly Effective Leaders (Steven Covey, 1998), emotional intelligence, work ethics, and values. The team was joined by Michele Merkel, MS, and Stu Merkel, MPH, MBA; their contribution was extremely valuable, especially because of the addition of the male perspective in leadership.
DR CONGO

Since 1996 the fourth largest African state has seen wars with its neighbors, civil wars, and other forms of violence that have proliferated immense poverty and famine, an AIDS/HIV epidemic, increasing rape rates and gender intolerance. The International Rescue Committee estimated that over 5.4 million people have died from the prolonged conflict, that Nicholas D.

Our organization,　The Association for Trauma Outreach & Prevention　(ATOP) of Meaningful World, a New York based international organization affiliated with DPI of the United Nations, devoted to fostering a, just, peaceful, and meaningful world, has collaborated with many organizations to bring rehabilitation programs to Sierra Leone in March of 2009, and over 29 other humanitarian empowerment, educational, and rehabilitation programs around the world including Haiti. Our mission to DR Congo will focus on the city of Bukavu, home to nearly half a million people, including 500 displaced children. We are collaborating with the Peace Center there, as well as Université de la Paix, refugee centers, and hospitals in the area. We will be working with vulnerable groups of children, women who were raped in the war, refugees and older adults. We have the experience and expertise to make a difference. ATOP team members that will be traveling to Congo are: Dr. Ani Kalayjian – Founder and President of ATOP. Dr. Kalayjian has devoted her life to bringing healing to those who have survived the devastation of disaster. Dr Isidore A. Udoh is a postdoctoral fellow at the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University, and Jennifer De Mucci – Vice President of ATOP, holds a Master’s degree in psychology.
Our goals are to help survivors heal their emotional and psychospiritual wounds resulting from years of armed conflict, poverty, discrimination, and displacement. We aim to help surviving communities understand the impact of the past on their present through education, healing groups, and self-healing. We will train psychologist, social workers, nurses and other health care practitioners. This helps create educated and healthy communities that are able to transform generationally transmitted trauma by cultivating a new world view, train and educate high school teachers and students to nurture non-violence in their respective communities, and foster communal dialogue for conflict transformation and peace-building through practicing forgiveness. We also plan to help mobilize communities, facilitating healthy partnerships that build bridges of diversity through common values centered on the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
We need your generous spirit! Please help us make a difference in in the lives of hundreds of people. Your generous donations are vital to make this ATOP of Meaningfulworld humanitarian outreach project a success. Our first team will depart June 29th 2013.

<h3>SES Baton Club</h3>
<p>These 20 cute second graders are learning to twirl batons for free, but many can't afford to buy twirling shoes or a costume for their April 20th competition.</p>
<p>When my 8yo daughter wanted to join a baton twirling team, I got the idea to start one at her school. At first it was a little selfish. Starting the club would save me the hassle of driving her to a neighboring town to pay another teacher for her to twirl. Then, I thought of how many kids at her school don't get to do fun stuff like baton, dance, karate or Scouts because over 75% of the families at her school are low-income and simply can't afford extra activities.</p>
<p>It didn't take much to get the Principle's green light to start the club and the membership jumped to 20 girls in only a few days. I volunteer my time to teach the club and the only expense has been for each girl to buy a $20 baton.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the girls need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>$200 Contest Enrtry fees ($10 per girl)</li>
<li>$1100 In Step Twirling Shoes ($55 per pair)</li>
<li>$700 Team Costume ($35 each)</li>
<li>And additional funds will buy each girl a team T-shirt</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Perk may be humble, but the joy you bring to these girls will be worth it.</p>
<p>If we don't meet the $2000 goal, we will use the funds to offset the cost of less expensive costumes and shoes and I will pay the contest entry fees out of my pocket.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Twirling Makes an Impact!</h3>
<p>Baton twirling made me a better person. Not only did I learn self-discipline, teamwork, coordination, and sportsmanship, but I made life-long friends from all over the country. I want to pass that experience on to these precious girls who wouldn't otherwise get the opportunity.</p>

<h3>Our Story &gt;&gt;</h3>
<p>After the death of our three year old son Gavin, we knew we wanted to give other kids like Gavin, who are dealing with life altering illnesses/disabilities, the same amazing life Gavin had.  In 2010 we welcomed home Angela to join Adam, myself and our older daughter Madison. Angela is diagnoised with cerebal palsy and 1p36 deletion syndrome.  Soon after we adopted Jayden who suffered traumatic brain injury and we currently are in the process of finalizing are youngest daughters adoption.</p>

<p>We want all our kids to grow up knowing that they can do anything they put their minds to and that they deserve to have the same opportunities and experiences as other kids their age.</p>
<p>Angela is a girl on a mission.  She wants to move and be independent.  Sadly, most of her equipment holds her high off the ground which leaves her no access to her toys or siblings.  She get very frustrated and we often spend our days bringing the world to her -- We want Angela to be able to GO TO her world.</p>

<p>We would like to purchase a few items.  The first is a chair called the <a href=""www.zipzac.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/499862/www.zipzac.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.zipzac.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.zipzac.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ZipZac</a> which will cost about $1200.  The chair will allow Angela to sit on the floor and reach her toys as well as be able to access big wheels to push herself around the house!  The second item is a <a href=""http://www.specialtomato.com/specialtomatotiltwedgekit2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Special Tomato Seat </a>which will cost around $500.  This seat will allow us to put Angela in other chairs besides her wheelchair, like the movies or out to eat -- even a jogger so she can go on runs with her daddy!

<p><b>What our volunteers/supporters say:</b></p>
<p><i>""The social gaps in Colombia are huge and unfortunately far too many children are denied adequate education. Giving children the opportunity to read is also giving them the opportunity to cope with life and the chance to create a good future. Spending a few hours in one of these libraries and talking to the children gives you a better understanding of this than all reports and figures you can get hold of. These children love reading, they want to learn and they understand the importance of reading. So let’s work together to give them the opportunity to gain this essential life skill."" <b>Karin Lager, Sweden</b></i></p>
<p><i>'Helping these kids to read opens the doors to so many opportunities for them! They can get an education, immerse themselves in books and express themselves through writing! It's a brilliant project!' </i><b>Becca Todd, England</b><br/></p>
<p><i>'Teaching these kids how to read is of one the greatest experience I had. They are just so keen to learn and improve themselves. So this project opens a complete new world for them with more education and probably a way more better future!' </i><b>Ole Chillt, Germany</b><br/></p>
<p><i>'Creating the opportunity for the children to befriend books and words and giving them the courage and confidence to read for themselves and out loud to others is an incredible life skill. This will allow them to grow in themselves and have life long benefits. <br/><br/>A quote from a favourite children's story of mine is: ""The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn the more places you go."" Dr Seuss ""I can read with my eyes shut""' </i><b>Julia Wickham, England</b><br/></p>
<p>""<i>Literacy opens doors that would ordinarily be closed for these kids. It gives them a future filled with possibilities. That is why my family are supporting ""100 kids - Let's Help Them Read</i>""<b> Melanie Berry, Australia</b></p>
<p><b>""</b><i>The pen is certainly mightier than the sword. The ability to read and write should be a basic skill for everyone. To think that so many children can be given these very powerful and life changing skills by sharing just the smallest amount of your own good fortune is a complete no brainer. I certainly come from a lucky country where we take so much for granted. Stop, be thankful of what you have and help change a life.</i>""<b> Ainslee Cox, Australia</b></p>

Volunteer. We need people on the ground and remotely, for everything from fundraising, to reading with the kids. Contact margaretobrien77@yahoo.com.au to find out more about the opportunities available.


What our volunteers/supporters say:
""The social gaps in Colombia are huge and unfortunately far too many children are denied adequate education. Giving children the opportunity to read is also giving them the opportunity to cope with life and the chance to create a good future. Spending a few hours in one of these libraries and talking to the children gives you a better understanding of this than all reports and figures you can get hold of. These children love reading, they want to learn and they understand the importance of reading. So let’s work together to give them the opportunity to gain this essential life skill."" Karin Lager, Sweden
'Helping these kids to read opens the doors to so many opportunities for them! They can get an education, immerse themselves in books and express themselves through writing! It's a brilliant project!' Becca Todd, England
'Teaching these kids how to read is of one the greatest experience I had. They are just so keen to learn and improve themselves. So this project opens a complete new world for them with more education and probably a way more better future!' Ole Chillt, Germany
'Creating the opportunity for the children to befriend books and words and giving them the courage and confidence to read for themselves and out loud to others is an incredible life skill. This will allow them to grow in themselves and have life long benefits. A quote from a favourite children's story of mine is: ""The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn the more places you go."" Dr Seuss ""I can read with my eyes shut""' Julia Wickham, England
""Literacy opens doors that would ordinarily be closed for these kids. It gives them a future filled with possibilities. That is why my family are supporting ""100 kids - Let's Help Them Read"" Melanie Berry, Australia
""The pen is certainly mightier than the sword. The ability to read and write should be a basic skill for everyone. To think that so many children can be given these very powerful and life changing skills by sharing just the smallest amount of your own good fortune is a complete no brainer. I certainly come from a lucky country where we take so much for granted. Stop, be thankful of what you have and help change a life."" Ainslee Cox, Australia",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Red Umbrella Project is a New York based peer-led group that works to amplify the voices of those who work in the sex trades through creative programming and legislative and policy advocacy. We are an executive member of the No Condoms as Evidence Coalition, an alliance of advocacy groups and resource providers from many different backgrounds united to pass the No Condoms as Evidence Bill through the NY State Legislature. We want to bring our experiences from this campaign to the Desiree Alliance Conference, a conference in Las Vegas dedicated ""<span>to provide leadership and create space for sex workers and supporters to come together to advocate for human, labor and civil rights for all workers in the sex industry."" We believe the drawbacks and successes of both our campaign and the coalition-building that made it possible provide fundamental knowledge for any advocacy group for those in the sex trades.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your generous contribution will help fund the travel expenses for members of Red Umbrella Project to travel to Las Vegas and present at the conference. We have raised enough money to cover most of our expenses but we need additional funds for:</p>
<p>-plane tickets for three</p>
<p>-food for three</p>
<p>-other expenses such as public transportation within the city and lodging for three<br/><br/>And it will not go unrewarded! Here are the incentives we are excited to offer for your giving:</p>
<p>-3 issues of $pread Magazine</p>
<p>-""Cooking in Heels"" by Ceyenne Doroshow</p>
<p>-Introductory year-long subscription to literary journal ""Prose &amp; Lore""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Those people who work within the sex trades are among the most marginalized members of our communities. The stigma and criminalization of the sex trades contributes to and facilitates economic, mental, physical, and social violence against those who work within them, especially when the workers already experience other extreme forms of oppression such as poverty, racism, transphobia, homophobia, and more. The NYPD practice of using condoms as evidence of prostitution is a prime example of this dynamic, and we have so far succeeded in having the District Attorneys of Nassau and King County in New York issue directives to their prosecutors and police officers to no longer use this practice. We further hope to pass the No Condoms as Evidence Bill, which will make the practice illegal within New York.</p>
<p>By funding our participation in the Desiree Conference, you will be helping us provide the information that advocacy groups for those in the sex trades need to start their own campaigns on ending their state or city's practice of using condoms as evidence, as well as more general information on how to form alliances with groups that advocate around issues other than sex work.</p>

In the past 3 years, over 100 Triangle teens have participated in our trainings and we have helped to mobilize hundreds of young people to speak-out in support of equity in public schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why YOI?</strong></p>
<p>Youth of color, LGBTQ youth, and poor and working class youth are under attack in public schools. Wake County has one of the highest suspension rates in the country. In Orange County students of color are 17x more likely to get suspended than white students for non violent crimes, such as cell phone use.  What's the solution?  Student Power!  When young people identify and name their problems, and are offered the tools, resources, and space to create solutions - the result is transformative.  In the legacy of SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committe) and following Ella Baker's leadership development models, the Youth Organizing Institute believes in elevating the collective voices and power of young people.</p>

<p>We will train 15 Triangle-based youth, ages 13-18 in a popular education-style curriculum that focuses on political education &amp; leadership development. </p>
<p>We will establish a year long inter-generational mentorship program for graduates.</p>
<p>We will strategize and plan to launch a campaign for a MORATORIUM on Out of School Suspensions</p>
<p>We will Put the Brakes on the School-to-Prison Pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>To meet our goals we need your help!</strong></p>

<p>• Enhance our summer program by taking a trip to the International Civil Rights Museum and Beloved Community Center in Greensboro</p>
<p>• Develop peer education around the school-to-prison pipeline and school push-out,</p>
<p>• Sustain our campaign for a Moratorium on out of-school suspensions by providing stipends to youth organizers.</p>

What is YOI? 
Short answer: YOI is a popular education leadership development program for high school age students.  We provide trainings on the policies that impact young people and how to organize to create change. In the past 3 years, over 100 Triangle teens have participated in our trainings and we have helped to mobilize hundreds of young people to speak-out in support of equity in public schools.
 
Why YOI?
Youth of color, LGBTQ youth, and poor and working class youth are under attack in public schools. Wake County has one of the highest suspension rates in the country. In Orange County students of color are 17x more likely to get suspended than white students for non violent crimes, such as cell phone use.  What's the solution?  Student Power!  When young people identify and name their problems, and are offered the tools, resources, and space to create solutions - the result is transformative.  In the legacy of SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committe) and following Ella Baker's leadership development models, the Youth Organizing Institute believes in elevating the collective voices and power of young people.
 
This Summer
We will train 15 Triangle-based youth, ages 13-18 in a popular education-style curriculum that focuses on political education & leadership development. 
We will establish a year long inter-generational mentorship program for graduates.
We will strategize and plan to launch a campaign for a MORATORIUM on Out of School Suspensions
We will Put the Brakes on the School-to-Prison Pipeline.
 
To meet our goals we need your help!
Funds donated will help us: • Increase the number of students we can accept into the summer program
• Enhance our summer program by taking a trip to the International Civil Rights Museum and Beloved Community Center in Greensboro
• Develop peer education around the school-to-prison pipeline and school push-out,
• Sustain our campaign for a Moratorium on out of-school suspensions by providing stipends to youth organizers.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY SO MANY CHILDREN ARE AT RISK AND WHAT YOU MUST KNOW TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY</strong></h3>
<p>
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    From the moment your child was born, you’ve given more love than you knew you had to give. You cradled your baby’s head, gently shampooed the soft spots,
    placed cushions around the crib, child-proofed your home, and installed a safety seat in your car.
</p>
<p>
    You did everything you could to keep your baby safe, and today your child runs, climbs, jumps, swims, cycles, skates and explores the world with a fearless
    hunger for adventure, experiencing fun, laughter and the occasional bump on the head.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s normal for kids to bump their heads</strong>
    - on kitchen cabinets, getting into cars, getting a can off a shelf, falling off a bike or skateboard, sliding down a railing or missing a catch at the
    park.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s normal for girls</strong>
    to get elbowed in soccer or collide on the basketball court.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s normal for boys</strong>
    to have their brains jostled on the football field by 1600 pounds of force hitting head-on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s normal for boys <em>and</em> girls</strong>
    to hit their heads when they slip in the tub, fall on the ice, tumble down a hill, trip on a shoelace or swim laps in the pool.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Kids hit their heads all the time – it’s just a normal part of childhood.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>But just because it’s <em>normal</em>, doesn't make it <em>healthy</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449857126/gqb9ncuy7bufk4sbxb2o.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p>
    The scary truth is <strong>every time your child’s head gets hit or jostled, s/he’s at risk for a concussion</strong> – a serious brain injury that can
    have a devastating impact on every part of his/her life.
</p>
<p>
    While we’d like to believe it could never happen to our own kids, the fact is concussions are much more common than we once believed.
</p>
<p>
    Research shows concussions have become a significant problem for millions of children worldwide. The <em>Center for Disease Control</em> says
    <strong>
        sports-related concussions are at epidemic levels and we’re seeing a widespread incidence of concussions occurring in playgrounds, classrooms, and even
        at home.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The latest research findings reveal <strong>70% of children have had at least one concussion, and they estimate the real number is closer to 90%</strong> -
    that’s 3 million children in the United States alone!
</p>
<p>
    It’s also estimated that <strong>40% of those children have never been diagnosed as <em>having</em> concussions</strong>. So these children are running
    around untreated and at serious risk for permanent brain damage, a dysfunctional life and an early death.
</p>
<p>
    We are committed to making sure this never happens to your child.
</p>
<p>
We are the <em>Brains Worldwide Foundation</em> and we’re driven to bring you the <strong>education</strong>, <strong>support</strong>,    <strong>research and technology</strong> you need to keep your children safe from the hidden dangers of brain concussion. We’re making that happen across 3
    critical areas of service.</p>
<h4><strong>BRAINS WORLDWIDE FOUNDATION EDUCATION</strong></h4>
<p>
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The brain is the control center of everything that keeps your child alive. Every breath, every heartbeat, every moment of laughter, learning and growth
    depends on your child having a healthy brain. You don’t need us to tell you that. But here are some critical facts about your child’s brain you may NOT
    know…
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Before the age of 14, children’s brains are at significantly higher risk for sustaining a concussion than at any other time of their lives.
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    If they do get a concussion, children between the ages of 5 and 18 run the highest risk of developing a condition called <em>Post Concussion Syndrome</em>
    leading to chronic headaches, dizziness and a host of other symptoms that could go on indefinitely and dramatically impact their lives.
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Research shows girls have 2 to 3 times more concussions than boys when they are playing the same sports and girls’ concussions are typically more severe
    and take longer to heal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    While all playground and sporting activities carry a risk of injury, the top 2 children’s sports for concussions are football for boys and soccer for
    girls.
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    We try to keep our children safe from concussions by having them they wear helmets, but research shows helmets reduce only <em>some</em> of the force of a
    hit to the head. In fact, while we once believed the only way to get a concussion is through a direct blow to the head, we now know this is a myth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    All it takes for your child to get a concussion is to be subjected to enough force so the brain gets jostled inside the skull, and that can happen by the
    air bag engaging in a car or being violently tossed around on a carnival ride.
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    All the research tells us the odds are really strong that your child will get a concussion. The problem is how are you supposed to know if your child’s
    brain gets injured – especially if you weren’t there to see it happen?
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Standard advice is to watch your child for headaches, dizziness, loss of consciousness or vomiting but these symptoms don’t always appear. Research has
    shown there are many hidden symptoms of concussions and far too often, these symptoms get ignored or attributed to something else.
</p>
<p>
    Here are just some of the symptoms that get overlooked or misinterpreted:
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Fatigue
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Lack of focus
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    A sudden drop in grades
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Irritability
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Concentration problems
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Aggression
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Lack of balance
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Sensitivity to light
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Sensitivity to sound
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Changes in sense of taste
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Changes in sense of smell
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Insomnia
</p>
<p>
<strong>==&gt; </strong>
    Mood Swings
</p>
<p>
    The fact is all these symptoms are commonly diagnosed as something other than a concussion, causing your child to be labeled with Social and Behavioral
    Problems, Learning Disorders, Psychological Disorders, or to be diagnosed with Allergies, Stress, Hormonal Changes, and the most common of all, ADHD
    (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Let’s take ADHD as an example –
</p>
<p>
    We know that in 2011, the CDC reported 11% of children aged 4 – 17 had been diagnosed with ADHD (that’s 6. 4 million children).
</p>
<p>
    The question is, <em>how many of those children are really suffering from undiagnosed concussions? </em>
</p>
<p>
And if that’s the case,    <strong><em>how can we assess these children before it’s too late and they are left with long-term brain dysfunction or worse?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Part of the problem is how assessments are made. If your child’s head gets hit in a supervised activity, assessments are typically done through the use of
    SUBJECTIVE measures. Your child will be asked a series of questions and observed for obvious symptoms like loss of consciousness or dizziness.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is <strong>concussions can impact 5 major areas of the brain, causing a host of symptoms that may not be immediately noticeable.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The bigger problem is <strong>subjective assessments do not accurately measure the health of these 5 areas of the brain.</strong>
</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448922979/wmhk6z2cchde7t42us2n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><strong>
<br/></strong><p></p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, subjective testing is the accepted standard, so if your child passes a subjective test, no referral is made to a doctor. Then, when hidden
    symptoms start to appear, no one makes the connection between the symptoms and the original brain injury. And since so many concussions happen outside of
    an adult’s watchful eye, you may not even know there <em>was</em> an original injury.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There is far too much at stake to risk your child’s life to subjective testing.</strong>
    Particularly since savvy student athletes have learned to cheat on those tests in order to keep on playing.
</p>
<p>
    Your child needs to be assessed for the hidden symptoms of concussion through an OBJECTIVE measure of 5 distinct areas of the brain. If that assessment is
    done accurately, you will know if your child’s brain has been injured and whether it’s necessary to get your child to a doctor.
</p>
<p>
    If your doctor diagnoses a concussion, then your child needs to be continuously monitored with OBJECTIVE measures to determine when it is safe to return to
    play.
</p>
<p>
<strong>No matter how much your child appears to be fine, please, don’t settle for subjective assessments that put your child’s life at risk.</strong>
</p>
<p>
At <em>Brains Worldwide Foundation</em>, we believe the greatest protection your child can have against undetected concussions is ongoing,    <strong>up-to-date education, access to convenient and affordable objective testing and a solid partnership between you and your pediatrician.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We’re committed to bringing you the education and support you need so you know how to identify, assess and report your child’s symptoms to your doctor. And
    that’s only the beginning of how we’re working to help you keep your child safe.
</p>
<h4><strong>THE BRAINS WORLDWIDE COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP FUND</strong></h4><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449857160/hri0ias0uxrktzggs1r4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><strong>
<br/></strong><p></p>
<p>
    The second way we’re helping parents keep their children safe is through the establishment of a college scholarship fund for children who can’t play sports
    due to a brain concussion.
</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>There is an ever-increasing problem occurring worldwide where,</strong>
<strong>despite physicians’ orders, children return to play before it’s safe.</strong></i></h4>
<p>
<i><strong> </strong>
</i></p>
<p>
    This puts children at tremendous risk because once a child has been concussed, any additional concussions significantly increase the risk for severely
    limited brain function, permanent degenerative brain damage, an ever-increasing cascade of thinking and behavioral problems and a life-threatening
    condition called <em>Secondary Impact Syndrome.</em>
</p>
<p>
    With so much at risk, why would a child return to play against doctor’s orders?
</p>
<p>
    Because the competitive edge is all about being tough, playing through the pain and being a team player.
</p>
<p>
    The social pressure to play is far stronger than a doctor’s treatment plan. After all, it’s just not cool to be a quitter. So kids learn to hide their
    symptoms, to cheat subjective test questions and to convince their parents, coaches and trainers that they’re totally fine.
</p>
<p>
    We understand a child’s drive to play is fueled by self-esteem, social recognition and the competitive drive to win. We also know for many child athletes,
    their urge to get back on the playing field is about survival. For these children, the only way they are able to have a hope for the future, is to receive
    a sporting scholarship to a good college, and that can’t happen if they’re not scouted on the field. The stakes for these kids are really high, so they do
    whatever it takes to stay in the game – even if it means risking their lives.
</p>
<p>
    That’s why we’re building the <strong><em>Brains Worldwide Scholarship Fund</em></strong> to provide financial assistance for child athletes who have been
    banned from play due to concussion.
</p>
<p>
    Our hope is that providing this support, we will help parents protect their children from undue risks without losing their chance for a successful and
    fulfilling future.

<p>
    All children get tossed around and bump their heads, but not all of them end up with concussions. So how are you supposed to know when your child needs
    medical help – especially if you didn’t see the incident?
</p>
<p>
    How can you get documented proof that your child is experiencing any or all of the hidden symptoms of concussion so you know whether you need to contact
    your doctor?
</p>
<p>
    And most importantly, how do you know when the symptoms are severe enough that you need to take your child straight to the emergency room?
</p>
<p>
    Finally, if your child is diagnosed with a concussion, how are you supposed to monitor the healing process objectively so you can protect your child from
    returning to the playing field before it’s safe?
</p>
<p>
    We’ve been researching this problem for more than 10 years, seeking powerful and affordable technologies to give parents the tools they need to protect
    their children.
</p>
<p>
    We’re excited to announce this technology now exists, giving moms and dads the power to objectively assess injury to the 5 critical areas of the brain that
    are affected by concussions with a simple, portable unit that is specifically designed for home-use.
</p>
<p>
    This innovative technology is called the<em> <strong>Objective Brain Concussion Assessment and Monitoring System™ </strong>(OBCAMS).</em>
</p><p><em></em></p><p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448923216/bmp5snvjuwbpaamdkbvg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p><em>
<br/></em><p></p>
<p>
<strong>
        OBCAMS brings powerful, cloud-based assessment, reporting and monitoring technology straight to your home so you have 24/7 access to test all areas of
        your child’s brain for maximum health by objectively assessing the 5 major areas of the brain that cause the hidden symptoms of concussion.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The higher your child's score across these 5 areas, the more serious the brain injury and the more urgent it is that you take your child to see a doctor to
    rule out a concussion.
</p>
<h4><strong>What’s it like to use OBCAMS?</strong></h4>
<p>
    For you, it’s simply a matter of watching a quick video and then inviting your child to play a quick game.
</p>
<p>
    For your child, it is like playing a video game with 5 different levels of play. Each level will engage your child in a different game, with fun activities
    that measure your child’s ability to focus, reaction time, vision tracking, memory and balance.
</p>
<p>
    This is OBCAMS –
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448923272/xmbnbqfgkejyzbdqqdhh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
    As you can see, unlike medical devices, OBCAMS doesn’t require probes or sensors to be attached to your child’s head. Simply hand the tablet to your child
    and in less than 10 minutes you’ll know whether your child’s brain is functioning within the range of a healthy brain.
</p>
<p>
The process is easy to use and anyone can make it work. Simply <em>touch the screen</em>, <em>follow the prompts</em> and    <em>invite your child to take the controls</em>.
</p>
<p>
While your child is watching the screen, the cloud-based software will measure the 5 major areas of your child’s brain with objective accuracy that    <em>can’t be manipulated by your child.</em>
</p>
<p>
    When you’re done, simply touch the screen to complete the test and if your child is in danger, you will be alerted to go immediately to your closest
    hospital for emergency care.
</p>
<p>
    If your child’s results are outside the range of healthy, you’ll be alerted to take the report to your pediatrician to determine the best course of
    treatment for your child.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448923338/gcc5ehj4ickixaetdt5u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> 

<p>Should your pediatrician recommend that your child stay off the playing field for a period of time, OBCAMS will help you monitor your child’s progress and
    give you objective data to bring to your doctor for follow-up care.
</p>
<p>
    If your child’s brain measures healthy in all 5 areas of the brain, your report will be emailed to you so you have it for comparison in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Kids love to take the OBCAMS tests and parents and doctors are telling us they’re excited about the OBCAMS technology--- but does it really work?
</p>
<h4><strong>PROOF</strong></h4>
<p>
    We tested a group of 2000 students and veterans using OBCAMS and here’s what we found:
</p>
<p>
    Of the 2000 people we tested, 401 showed significant symptoms of brain concussions. We then sent those people to their doctors, who, in turn, confirmed our
findings – each of the 401 who had shown significant symptoms with OBCAMS, were diagnosed with brain concussions by their doctors. That's    <strong>100% accuracy</strong>.
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448923374/y3fq003ijwakrbkphfwf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
    Now here’s the really scary part of the findings:
</p>
<p>
    Of the 401 people who were found to have brain concussions, 38% had been previously cleared by the medical community. In other words, these people had been
    told they did <em>not</em> have concussions!
</p>
<p>
    If we hadn’t used OBCAMS to test those people, 152 children and veterans would have been at serious risk for extended brain damage.
</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>How many more children are out there with undetected concussions?</i></strong></h4>
<p>
    OBCAMS technology is being manufactured by <em>Brains Worldwide, Inc.</em>, and will be available to the general public for retail purchase in 2016.
    However the <em>Brains Worldwide Foundation</em> may be able to get this technology to you in advance before the general public through our mandate for
    research.
</p>
<p>

WHY SO MANY CHILDREN ARE AT RISK AND WHAT YOU MUST KNOW TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY

 


    From the moment your child was born, you’ve given more love than you knew you had to give. You cradled your baby’s head, gently shampooed the soft spots,
    placed cushions around the crib, child-proofed your home, and installed a safety seat in your car.


    You did everything you could to keep your baby safe, and today your child runs, climbs, jumps, swims, cycles, skates and explores the world with a fearless
    hunger for adventure, experiencing fun, laughter and the occasional bump on the head.


It’s normal for kids to bump their heads
    - on kitchen cabinets, getting into cars, getting a can off a shelf, falling off a bike or skateboard, sliding down a railing or missing a catch at the
    park.


It’s normal for girls
    to get elbowed in soccer or collide on the basketball court.


It’s normal for boys
    to have their brains jostled on the football field by 1600 pounds of force hitting head-on.


It’s normal for boys and girls
    to hit their heads when they slip in the tub, fall on the ice, tumble down a hill, trip on a shoelace or swim laps in the pool.


Kids hit their heads all the time – it’s just a normal part of childhood.


 


But just because it’s normal, doesn't make it healthy.


    The scary truth is every time your child’s head gets hit or jostled, s/he’s at risk for a concussion – a serious brain injury that can
    have a devastating impact on every part of his/her life.


    While we’d like to believe it could never happen to our own kids, the fact is concussions are much more common than we once believed.


    Research shows concussions have become a significant problem for millions of children worldwide. The Center for Disease Control says
    
        sports-related concussions are at epidemic levels and we’re seeing a widespread incidence of concussions occurring in playgrounds, classrooms, and even
        at home.
    


    The latest research findings reveal 70% of children have had at least one concussion, and they estimate the real number is closer to 90% -
    that’s 3 million children in the United States alone!


    It’s also estimated that 40% of those children have never been diagnosed as having concussions. So these children are running
    around untreated and at serious risk for permanent brain damage, a dysfunctional life and an early death.


    We are committed to making sure this never happens to your child.


We are the Brains Worldwide Foundation and we’re driven to bring you the education, support,    research and technology you need to keep your children safe from the hidden dangers of brain concussion. We’re making that happen across 3
    critical areas of service.
BRAINS WORLDWIDE FOUNDATION EDUCATION

 


    The brain is the control center of everything that keeps your child alive. Every breath, every heartbeat, every moment of laughter, learning and growth
    depends on your child having a healthy brain. You don’t need us to tell you that. But here are some critical facts about your child’s brain you may NOT
    know…


==> 
    Before the age of 14, children’s brains are at significantly higher risk for sustaining a concussion than at any other time of their lives.


==> 
    If they do get a concussion, children between the ages of 5 and 18 run the highest risk of developing a condition called Post Concussion Syndrome
    leading to chronic headaches, dizziness and a host of other symptoms that could go on indefinitely and dramatically impact their lives.


==> 
    Research shows girls have 2 to 3 times more concussions than boys when they are playing the same sports and girls’ concussions are typically more severe
    and take longer to heal.


==> 
    While all playground and sporting activities carry a risk of injury, the top 2 children’s sports for concussions are football for boys and soccer for
    girls.


==> 
    We try to keep our children safe from concussions by having them they wear helmets, but research shows helmets reduce only some of the force of a
    hit to the head. In fact, while we once believed the only way to get a concussion is through a direct blow to the head, we now know this is a myth.


==> 
    All it takes for your child to get a concussion is to be subjected to enough force so the brain gets jostled inside the skull, and that can happen by the
    air bag engaging in a car or being violently tossed around on a carnival ride.


==> 
    All the research tells us the odds are really strong that your child will get a concussion. The problem is how are you supposed to know if your child’s
    brain gets injured – especially if you weren’t there to see it happen?


==> 
    Standard advice is to watch your child for headaches, dizziness, loss of consciousness or vomiting but these symptoms don’t always appear. Research has
    shown there are many hidden symptoms of concussions and far too often, these symptoms get ignored or attributed to something else.


    Here are just some of the symptoms that get overlooked or misinterpreted:


==> 
    Fatigue


==> 
    Lack of focus


==> 
    A sudden drop in grades


==> 
    Irritability


==> 
    Concentration problems


==> 
    Aggression


==> 
    Lack of balance


==> 
    Sensitivity to light


==> 
    Sensitivity to sound


==> 
    Changes in sense of taste


==> 
    Changes in sense of smell


==> 
    Insomnia


==> 
    Mood Swings


    The fact is all these symptoms are commonly diagnosed as something other than a concussion, causing your child to be labeled with Social and Behavioral
    Problems, Learning Disorders, Psychological Disorders, or to be diagnosed with Allergies, Stress, Hormonal Changes, and the most common of all, ADHD
    (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Let’s take ADHD as an example –


    We know that in 2011, the CDC reported 11% of children aged 4 – 17 had been diagnosed with ADHD (that’s 6. 4 million children).


    The question is, how many of those children are really suffering from undiagnosed concussions? 


And if that’s the case,    how can we assess these children before it’s too late and they are left with long-term brain dysfunction or worse?


    Part of the problem is how assessments are made. If your child’s head gets hit in a supervised activity, assessments are typically done through the use of
    SUBJECTIVE measures. Your child will be asked a series of questions and observed for obvious symptoms like loss of consciousness or dizziness.


    The problem is concussions can impact 5 major areas of the brain, causing a host of symptoms that may not be immediately noticeable.


    The bigger problem is subjective assessments do not accurately measure the health of these 5 areas of the brain.



    Nevertheless, subjective testing is the accepted standard, so if your child passes a subjective test, no referral is made to a doctor. Then, when hidden
    symptoms start to appear, no one makes the connection between the symptoms and the original brain injury. And since so many concussions happen outside of
    an adult’s watchful eye, you may not even know there was an original injury.


There is far too much at stake to risk your child’s life to subjective testing.
    Particularly since savvy student athletes have learned to cheat on those tests in order to keep on playing.


    Your child needs to be assessed for the hidden symptoms of concussion through an OBJECTIVE measure of 5 distinct areas of the brain. If that assessment is
    done accurately, you will know if your child’s brain has been injured and whether it’s necessary to get your child to a doctor.


    If your doctor diagnoses a concussion, then your child needs to be continuously monitored with OBJECTIVE measures to determine when it is safe to return to
    play.


No matter how much your child appears to be fine, please, don’t settle for subjective assessments that put your child’s life at risk.


At Brains Worldwide Foundation, we believe the greatest protection your child can have against undetected concussions is ongoing,    up-to-date education, access to convenient and affordable objective testing and a solid partnership between you and your pediatrician.


    We’re committed to bringing you the education and support you need so you know how to identify, assess and report your child’s symptoms to your doctor. And
    that’s only the beginning of how we’re working to help you keep your child safe.

THE BRAINS WORLDWIDE COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP FUND


    The second way we’re helping parents keep their children safe is through the establishment of a college scholarship fund for children who can’t play sports
    due to a brain concussion.

There is an ever-increasing problem occurring worldwide where,
despite physicians’ orders, children return to play before it’s safe.

 


    This puts children at tremendous risk because once a child has been concussed, any additional concussions significantly increase the risk for severely
    limited brain function, permanent degenerative brain damage, an ever-increasing cascade of thinking and behavioral problems and a life-threatening
    condition called Secondary Impact Syndrome.


    With so much at risk, why would a child return to play against doctor’s orders?


    Because the competitive edge is all about being tough, playing through the pain and being a team player.


    The social pressure to play is far stronger than a doctor’s treatment plan. After all, it’s just not cool to be a quitter. So kids learn to hide their
    symptoms, to cheat subjective test questions and to convince their parents, coaches and trainers that they’re totally fine.


    We understand a child’s drive to play is fueled by self-esteem, social recognition and the competitive drive to win. We also know for many child athletes,
    their urge to get back on the playing field is about survival. For these children, the only way they are able to have a hope for the future, is to receive
    a sporting scholarship to a good college, and that can’t happen if they’re not scouted on the field. The stakes for these kids are really high, so they do
    whatever it takes to stay in the game – even if it means risking their lives.


    That’s why we’re building the Brains Worldwide Scholarship Fund to provide financial assistance for child athletes who have been
    banned from play due to concussion.


    Our hope is that providing this support, we will help parents protect their children from undue risks without losing their chance for a successful and
    fulfilling future.

BRAINS WORLDWIDE ONGOING RESEARCH


    The third and most crucial mandate of the Brains Worldwide Foundation is ongoing research
 on
concussion assessment, reporting and monitoring technology
    .

    All children get tossed around and bump their heads, but not all of them end up with concussions. So how are you supposed to know when your child needs
    medical help – especially if you didn’t see the incident?


    How can you get documented proof that your child is experiencing any or all of the hidden symptoms of concussion so you know whether you need to contact
    your doctor?


    And most importantly, how do you know when the symptoms are severe enough that you need to take your child straight to the emergency room?


    Finally, if your child is diagnosed with a concussion, how are you supposed to monitor the healing process objectively so you can protect your child from
    returning to the playing field before it’s safe?


    We’ve been researching this problem for more than 10 years, seeking powerful and affordable technologies to give parents the tools they need to protect
    their children.


    We’re excited to announce this technology now exists, giving moms and dads the power to objectively assess injury to the 5 critical areas of the brain that
    are affected by concussions with a simple, portable unit that is specifically designed for home-use.


    This innovative technology is called the Objective Brain Concussion Assessment and Monitoring System™ (OBCAMS).




        OBCAMS brings powerful, cloud-based assessment, reporting and monitoring technology straight to your home so you have 24/7 access to test all areas of
        your child’s brain for maximum health by objectively assessing the 5 major areas of the brain that cause the hidden symptoms of concussion.
    


    The higher your child's score across these 5 areas, the more serious the brain injury and the more urgent it is that you take your child to see a doctor to
    rule out a concussion.

What’s it like to use OBCAMS?

    For you, it’s simply a matter of watching a quick video and then inviting your child to play a quick game.


    For your child, it is like playing a video game with 5 different levels of play. Each level will engage your child in a different game, with fun activities
    that measure your child’s ability to focus, reaction time, vision tracking, memory and balance.


    This is OBCAMS –


    As you can see, unlike medical devices, OBCAMS doesn’t require probes or sensors to be attached to your child’s head. Simply hand the tablet to your child
    and in less than 10 minutes you’ll know whether your child’s brain is functioning within the range of a healthy brain.


The process is easy to use and anyone can make it work. Simply touch the screen, follow the prompts and    invite your child to take the controls.


While your child is watching the screen, the cloud-based software will measure the 5 major areas of your child’s brain with objective accuracy that    can’t be manipulated by your child.


    When you’re done, simply touch the screen to complete the test and if your child is in danger, you will be alerted to go immediately to your closest
    hospital for emergency care.


    If your child’s results are outside the range of healthy, you’ll be alerted to take the report to your pediatrician to determine the best course of
    treatment for your child. 

Should your pediatrician recommend that your child stay off the playing field for a period of time, OBCAMS will help you monitor your child’s progress and
    give you objective data to bring to your doctor for follow-up care.


    If your child’s brain measures healthy in all 5 areas of the brain, your report will be emailed to you so you have it for comparison in the future.


    Kids love to take the OBCAMS tests and parents and doctors are telling us they’re excited about the OBCAMS technology--- but does it really work?

PROOF

    We tested a group of 2000 students and veterans using OBCAMS and here’s what we found:


    Of the 2000 people we tested, 401 showed significant symptoms of brain concussions. We then sent those people to their doctors, who, in turn, confirmed our
findings – each of the 401 who had shown significant symptoms with OBCAMS, were diagnosed with brain concussions by their doctors. That's    100% accuracy.


    Now here’s the really scary part of the findings:


    Of the 401 people who were found to have brain concussions, 38% had been previously cleared by the medical community. In other words, these people had been
    told they did not have concussions!


    If we hadn’t used OBCAMS to test those people, 152 children and veterans would have been at serious risk for extended brain damage.

How many more children are out there with undetected concussions?

    OBCAMS technology is being manufactured by Brains Worldwide, Inc., and will be available to the general public for retail purchase in 2016.
    However the Brains Worldwide Foundation may be able to get this technology to you in advance before the general public through our mandate for
    research.



        We are collaborating with Brains Worldwide, Inc. to give 150 families a substantial discount to purchase the new OBCAMS technology so they can use it
        to objectively test their children’s brain health at home.
    


    If your family is selected for this program, you will participate in a pilot study where we will document your use of the OBCAMS technology for 1 year,
    noting any questions you might have along the way.


    Your feedback will provide the information we need to better serve families in the future through our 24 Hour Hotline service and ongoing
    education to help parents discuss test findings with their pediatricians.


In thanks for your participation in this study,    we will cover 50% of the fee for your device, technology and support, and the OBCAMS system will be yours to keep forever.


The pilot study will begin on March 1, 2016, and you can    apply to be one of the 150 families included by selecting the Pilot Study Perk on this page.



    The simple truth of childhood is that no matter how much we love our children and try to keep them safe, our kids will run and play and inevitably bump
    their heads.


    While we may not be able to fully protect our kids from getting concussions, at Brains Worldwide Foundation we are committed to bringing you the
    education, support, research and technology you need so you can keep your family safe from the hidden danger of concussions.

<p>Ever since I was a child I thought that entering the field of counseling would be immensely useful work, and deeply rewarding in a personal-spiritual sense as well. Spiritual I say, because there is nothing more rewarding than having a deep and authentic encounter with another human being; it rewards by refining my own essence, and from the satisfaction of knowing that it helps to lighten the load of another…  In fact I believe that promotion of the empathic art of counseling throughout human society in general has the capacity to generate profound social change; a paradigm shift, if you will, such as was understood by Gene Rodenberrry when he created a futuristic society complete with an empathic race of Betazoids, some of whom provided counseling to Star Fleet.</p>
<p>Why did I not do this when I was younger? I guess I felt immortal, and that I had all the time in the world. I followed the muse of music in those days, and it was soul enriching to live the artist’s path. At one point I wound up in Kathmandu, Nepal – and stayed for 11 years. There I lived an eight year intercultural marriage with a native Buddhist of Yolmo Tamang ethnicity. I studied Buddhism, went on many pilgrimages, and learned from the gentle ways of my extended Buddhist family. Many times, the wish filled my heart for giving back from the soul riches I received. Sadly, due to the strange twisting’s of karma, in the form of an illness, I had to leave Nepal, and so ended my marriage.</p>
<p>There are so many suffering people in this world. We suffer from many things, including lack of food, finances, security, shelter, social oppression, violence, abuse, communication issues, anxiety and depression. A counselor’s role is to help people find empowering self-awareness toward achieving their goals, and resolving their difficulties. This type of empowerment is a self-development that gives continuing strength for the journey of life.</p>
<p>All people of all walks of life, colors, nations, cultures, religions, class or socio-economic status experience suffering. The therapeutic process helps people become self-aware, and to lead authentic lives. And, as we become aware of how we have been affected by power, privilege, or oppression, we become compassionate social activists.</p>
<p>For those of you with knowledge of psychology, I am attracted mostly to Solution Focused Therapy, a practical, and person-centered, positive psychology approach that respects clients for already having experience, and knowledge, they can build on for solutions; they may just need help in the process, along with some unconditional positive regard. Other approaches I like are Relational-Cultural Theory, Narrative, and Cognitive Behavioral Theory. My approach is fuelled by my personal spirituality, informed by Mooji, Buddha, Yoga, and Gaia, though not in any particular order, and devoid of any dogma.</p>
<p>My life as well has had its share of suffering.</p>
<p>Help me to realize my dream?</p>
<p>As a mother, as a Buddhist, as counselor.</p>
<p>I need to do a certain university course in October, and that is why I am asking for help now…</p>
<p>I am enrolled in Capella University’s online program in Mental Health Counseling. I must attend a Colloquium course in Florida, for a week in October, and I am $4,000 short of what I need for that (tuition, flights, and hotel costs). I have already delayed this course once, because it is not covered by financial aid (student loans), and I haven’t got the money. The course is required, and there is a chance that I will be dropped from the University program if I try to delay it again. I can’t buy tickets or register for the course unless I get some help. </p>
<p>I embarked on this life path a few years ago, and have completed 8 courses so far, (32 credits), with all A’s and one B, for an average grade of 3.875. I still have 64 credits to go, and I am doubling up my course load now that my son is in preschool.</p>
<p>I have no other sources of support currently than my student loans, and I am only eligible for the bare minimum, not enough for our survival. I am lucky that a friend gave my son and I a place to live in Berlin, Germany, where a good preschool is only 25 Euros a month. I am looking for work, having just arrived, and not speaking German. I am counting on finding some real philanthropists, who can be the warm, caring family I need to support me through this launch into a new, and very worthwhile career.</p>
<p>When I graduate, or before, I wish to return to the United States to work for a community mental health agency. I firmly believe that if governments put as much money into healing society, as they do for wars, that the human species would evolve far beyond belief in violence, and become all that we have ever dreamed. This is my effort towards that; I pray that I will achieve this goal. With your help I can.</p>

I have no other sources of support currently than my student loans, and I am only eligible for the bare minimum, not enough for our survival. I am lucky that a friend gave my son and I a place to live in Berlin, Germany, where a good preschool is only 25 Euros a month. I am looking for work, having just arrived, and not speaking German. I am counting on finding some real philanthropists, who can be the warm, caring family I need to support me through this launch into a new, and very worthwhile career.
When I graduate, or before, I wish to return to the United States to work for a community mental health agency. I firmly believe that if governments put as much money into healing society, as they do for wars, that the human species would evolve far beyond belief in violence, and become all that we have ever dreamed. This is my effort towards that; I pray that I will achieve this goal. With your help I can.
Be Well, Hugs,

children on the autism spectrum learn to ski. 
Started two years ago, the program is available at Sugarloaf Mountain in
Carrabassett Valley.  </p>
<p>Like all children, kids with autism should have the
opportunity to participate in outdoor winter activities, learn a new sport, and
be involved with other kids. Children with autism, however, have challenges
that require a person trained in understanding autism to assist them…..<b><i>Spruce
Point on the Slopes</i></b> provides this!</p>
<p>Trained volunteers provide 1:1 support for children with
autism enrolled in the mountain ski school groups. Spruce Point volunteers have
expertise in the field of autism, and have careers such as special education
teacher, clinician, recreation therapist, speech and language professional, and
direct care provider.</p>
<p>Benjamin Kahrl, father of six-year Lily, remembers the look
on his daughter’s face when she skied for the first time: <i>“She absolutely loved it. For our family, Spruce Point on the Slopes
meant being able to take a vacation together. In the past, we had to plan
separate activities that were appropriate for each child. Now, we can do these
things together.”</i></p>
<p><b>Why should you
support this effort?</b></p>
<p>The prevalence of autism continues to rise, with 1 in 88
children now being diagnosed. Children on the autism spectrum and their
families are often so involved in educational services, meetings, and special
therapies that there is little time or energy leftover for fun. Spruce Point on

in classes with other children. <b><i><u>Your donation will fully cover the cost

A member of our church has a daughter who has been living and working with a mission in Moldova for nearly 2 years now and has helped us learn of the great need in this forgotten part of Europe. We have formed a group of six people to travel to Moldova from Aug. 4 to Aug. 18, 2012 to take part in an outreach program.</p>
<p>Without putting too fine a point on it, the country is in bad shape. Moldova is known as the poorest country in Europe. Extreme poverty exists in the villages and towns—annual income can be as low as $250. Unemployment is around 80% and many people rely on the produce from their land as their only source of income. Moldova has many social problems due to parents leaving the country to find work. Human trafficking and alcoholism are rampant.</p>
<p>Here's an example of why we are passionate about going to this country to help... A member of the mission in Moldova was in a village and discovered a home that had only two occupants: a six year old and a 4 month old baby. The children had lice and had not eaten in at least 4 days. Most of us can't imagine such poverty!</p>
<p>Trust is a big issue in this country. Following many years of corruption, people are very reluctant to trust. As foreigners, we are able to build bridges between the group that is working to bring aid and the people who need it. We will be engaging in children's programs and bringing supplies to the elderly.</p>
<p>We have raised most of our support for our flights and costs while there, so your donation will not go toward our costs. We will use the money we raise here to bring supplies with us from Canada for the children. Just a few dollars will enable us to bring things like crayons and inflatable balls to give to the kids. $100 will purchase badly needed food supplies for the elderly. $1,000 will build a playground—they actually don't have these!</p>
<p>There has been a change and I will be joining my group in the trekking adventure. Originally I had planned to do a cycling adventure while the rest of my group went trekking. The video at the top shows a trekking group from 2011.</p>
<p>For your donation of $10 we will send you a photo of our team and a personal greeting. If you make a donation of $100, I will also send you a digital copy of <em>Prairies North: the magazine of Saskatchewan</em> (this is my business). If you make a donation of $1,000 or more, we will include all of the above and send you a video of us in Moldova.</p>
<p>If we raise more than our goal of $1,000, the money will be used for programs to rescue young women and children from the human trafficking industry or for operating a day centre for children. So, don't stop at $1,000! We are contributing this money directly to the group in Moldova so every penny will be used to help them.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's OK. We want to let people know about Moldova and the great need in this country, so share our campaign. You can also send people here: <a href=""http://www.md.om.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.md.om.org/</a> for more information. Prayers for our group are most welcome.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our intention and goal is to make Samui Montessori a special place where parents, teachers and staff work together to provide a safe, harmonious and enriching environment for children to learn and grow.<br/> The school’s philosophy is founded on the educational principles developed by Maria Montessori. The Montessori method is based on a deep respect for children’s spontaneous desire to learn and celebrates each child’s inherent talents and unique personality. Learning environments are created to foster functional independence and develop a lifelong love of learning.</p>
<p>Our school is starting very small, expecting only 25 children in the first year. We are a family-run school and funding has been out-of-pocket and through loans entirely. Classes started in September, 2012 and we are slowly building our classes and getting our name into the community.</p>
<p>Our teachers are AMI trained and come from overseas. Our assistants are parent volunteers and local Thai staff, interested in the Montessori philosophy of education and excited to help us start the school.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are raising funds for a few main needs that the school has:</p>
<p>1. Scholarship fund for local children to  attend the school at a reduced rate</p>
2. Playground equipment: a slide, swing set and climbing area that will be accessible to students and the rest of the community.</div>
<div>3. Repairs to the school in preparation for the monsoon season: rain guards and a cover for our outdoor portion of the classroom.</div>
<div>4. More Montessori materials for the growing classes and help to set up our garden planters. We would like to send our Thai staff to do AMI training here in Thailand as well!</div>
<div>5. We plan to expand within the next two years, to buy land and build a Montessori school village for toddlers through high school. Any help towards this goal would be incredible!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Montessori education is education for Peace. By helping children to learn at their own speed in an environment that is tailored 100% to them, they are led onto the path of healthy, happy development. We teach children to be functionally independent, courteous and polite citizens of the world. We teach conflict resolution and the environment fosters a strong bond between the mixed ages. Children learn with enthusiasm and are much better prepared to become productive, kind members of society.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Our intention and goal is to make Samui Montessori a special place where parents, teachers and staff work together to provide a safe, harmonious and enriching environment for children to learn and grow. The school’s philosophy is founded on the educational principles developed by Maria Montessori. The Montessori method is based on a deep respect for children’s spontaneous desire to learn and celebrates each child’s inherent talents and unique personality. Learning environments are created to foster functional independence and develop a lifelong love of learning.
Our school is starting very small, expecting only 25 children in the first year. We are a family-run school and funding has been out-of-pocket and through loans entirely. Classes started in September, 2012 and we are slowly building our classes and getting our name into the community.
Our teachers are AMI trained and come from overseas. Our assistants are parent volunteers and local Thai staff, interested in the Montessori philosophy of education and excited to help us start the school.


What We Need
We are raising funds for a few main needs that the school has:
1. Scholarship fund for local children to  attend the school at a reduced rate
2. Playground equipment: a slide, swing set and climbing area that will be accessible to students and the rest of the community.
3. Repairs to the school in preparation for the monsoon season: rain guards and a cover for our outdoor portion of the classroom.
4. More Montessori materials for the growing classes and help to set up our garden planters. We would like to send our Thai staff to do AMI training here in Thailand as well!
5. We plan to expand within the next two years, to buy land and build a Montessori school village for toddlers through high school. Any help towards this goal would be incredible!

The Impact
Montessori education is education for Peace. By helping children to learn at their own speed in an environment that is tailored 100% to them, they are led onto the path of healthy, happy development. We teach children to be functionally independent, courteous and polite citizens of the world. We teach conflict resolution and the environment fosters a strong bond between the mixed ages. Children learn with enthusiasm and are much better prepared to become productive, kind members of society. Montessori-educated children often learn to read and write faster than traditional education, have a better grasp of mathematics and geography through the hands-on materials that are used in Montessori classes.
 
1. Your contribution will make it possible for low-income children to attend the school. 2. It will also help to create a much-needed community space for parents and children to meet and play outside of school hours.
3. We can lower tuition if we receive outside help for the school, giving more people the opportunity to join.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please tell your friends about our project.
Donations of books, wooden toys, puzzles, art and craft supplies and stationary paper are greatly appreciated as well.
For local residents, your time to help us with our garden would be great. Also, we are open to ideas for community gatherings, play dates and other functions that we can hold at Samui Montessori.

<h2>Our Playful Mission</h2>
<p>Playful Roots is a non-denominational, spiritual ministry created by 2 moms bringing the wisdom of yoga, tai- chi, Native American, tribal African, and energy activations to families of all backgrounds. Personal transformation is the path to societal transformation. The Children's Sanctuary Project is located in the magical mountains of Crestone,Colorado. Rev. Tiya Keyze and Cecile Lanao are the creators of Playful Roots and are committed to healing themselves and  the planet back into LOVE.</p>

<h2><strong>Children's Sanctuary Project in Crestone,Colorado.</strong></h2>
<p>The ministry offers tools allowing children and families to move through life with ease and grace. As a 501c(3) Charitable nonprofit, non-denominational ministry, our vision to offer yoga programs, counseling, spiritual services, and wellness based workshops, to those who need it most, everyone!  <br/><br/>Your funds help to keep The Temple of Consciousness as a space to empower  children through classes that will lead them to the guru within.  All classes help to foster creativity and expansiveness in self. The 5 human values are at the core of our teachings.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Truth (Love in speech)</p>
<p>Right conduct (Love in action)</p>
<p>Peace (Love in thought)</p>
<p>Non-violence (Love in understanding<strong>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The magnitude</strong> of what we can achieve here is unparalleled.  With Love, you attract your higher self.  If we can all attract our higher selves, the shift into unity is here. The information era has pushed us to evolve in the understanding that we are not a society of many cultures but a tribe of one. We are not associated with any one religion; instead we practice the human code of tolerance and compassion for all systems of peaceful beliefs. As an organization we are created of many different backgrounds, but it’s the yoga at our core, that strengthens the faith in ourselves and in-turn allows us to plant the seed of self-love in others. . When you allow the mind to be calm, you are able to make lighter, more conscious decisions for yourself and those around you.</p>
<p>Yoga is more than a downward dog or a headstand; it’s the ability to take the confidence and peace gained in the physical practice to all aspects of ones life.    The child in each of us wants to be free and live with the peace and ease that is deserved.  Yoga is the union with this divine love. Spreading this light to all is the mission of our ministry.  Your fund will help us to sustain our programs for families.Our community is  based on self mastery and sustainablitlity.  We teach, mentor and give back through programs based on a simple four part philosophy that allows this complicated world to be turned on it’s head...</p>

You will find a unique blend of yoga, sound healing, breath work and aromatherapy, all supporting the growth of our children. Our classes are great for prompting focus, managing stress, emotions, and self-confidence.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>The global budget crisis led to cutbacks in school art programs all over the world. In 2011, Zanbeel Art launched a program called ""<strong>South Asian Art Literacy for Youth</strong>"" (SAALY). SAALY is an<strong> educational outreach program</strong> that strives to <strong>build bridges</strong> between the U.S and South Asia via art classes and <strong>art exchanges</strong> in low income schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SAALY'S FIRST PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>Geared to tackle this problem head on, SAALY made its debut in October 2011 with its pilot at The Watts Elementary School in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>An underprivileged school district, many students at this elementary school never had the opportunity to take art classes previously and knew virtually nothing about the South Asian region. Zanbeel Art handpicked accomplished artists to teach weekly art classes to the 5th grade on topics including portraits, sculpture, calligraphy, photography, endangered species, and herb planting.</p>
<p>The artists/teachers utilized creative tools such as visual projections, maps, and various art materials to help the students build essential critical thinking skills and an ability to see the world from a new perspective. Teachers worked closely with students to help transform negative thoughts and assumptions they may have about South Asia into a deeper understanding, empathy, and mutual respect for the region and its people. </p>
<p>The purpose of the classes was to trigger a nine-week intellectual transformation of the students by expanding their understanding of the idea of culture and encouraging them to become citizens of the world. Activities were focused on developing skills needed to live and work effectively in culturally and politically diverse societies.</p>
<p>Each class closely followed Los Angeles public school guidelines in areas such as Social Studies and Geography, and incorporated K-12 education standards which will be in affect in 2013. All classes were designed by teacher and education expert Cheryl Maletta Trujillo of California State University, Dominguez Hills.</p>
<p><strong>CONTINUING SAALY PROJECTS</strong></p>
<p>SAALY 2011 was so successful that The Watts Elementary School has invited Zanbeel Art back to implement <strong>SAALY 2012</strong>. Although the core of the program will remain the same, this years classes will incorporate a <strong>creative exchange with students in Pakistan</strong> that belong to a similar age group and low socioeconomic status.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Haskin Elementary School in Center, Colorado has an extremely high at-risk student population and has long struggled to raise reading achievement.  With a 90% poverty rate as determined by federal free and reduced lunch participation and a 50% English Language Learner population, we have long struggled to bring our reading performance up to state average.</p>
<p>In 2010, upon receiving a federal Turnaround Improvement Grant, all Haskin staff members were trained in the Lindamood-Bell reading intervention processes.  After one year of full implementation, Haskin 3rd grade reading proficiency increased from 28% proficient in 2010 to 41% proficient in 2011.  </p>
<p>After 2 years of implementation our reading proficiency increased to 76% in 2012, greater that the state of Colorado average proficiency of the very first time.  </p>
<p>With the end of our Turnaround grant we have struggled to secure the funds needed to provide this intervention to EVERY child who needs it.  </p>
<p>In 2013 our 3rd grade reading proficiency remained high at 62% proficient, and in 2014 it was at 67%.  However, during each of these years we had to treat fewer and fewer children because of a lack of after school services dollars.</p>
<p>Though Turnaround Improvement Grant dollars have gone away, we still have many staff members who are trained in this intervention process and would be willing to continue their work, if only they can be compensated. </p>
<p>Our goal is to provide EVERY child who needs this intervention with 80 hours of services after school  We currently serve 45 children.  We need to serve 75.  In this year's budget we are $12,000 short of our goal to serve all 75 children so any contribution you make will help us to provide these services for EVERY child who needs them.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our Lindamood-Bell after school intervention process costs $25 per hour to provide  treatment for up to 5 children in a group.  </p>
<p>A contribution of $25 will pay for 5 children to experience one full hour of intervention.</p>
<p>A contribution of $75 will pay for 5 children to experience a week's worth of intervention (3 one hour sessions).</p>
<p>A contribution of $2,000 will pay for 5 children to have all 80 hours of intervention. </p>
<p>$12,000 will guarantee a total of 30 extra children receive 80 hours of intervention! </p>
<ul>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At over 90% free and reduced lunch, the Center School District is among the highest poverty school systems in the state of Colorado. In addition to this, there are some school districts that have single residences worth more than the total taxable value of property in the Center School District (only $25 million).  </p>
<p>This lack of property value makes it nearly impossible for us to increase funding through our local mill levy.  Your monetary contribution will ensure we provide this proven treatment to EVERY child who needs it at Haskin Elementary School!</p>

That day was a day of great loss, but for me it was also a catalyst to do something important in the world.The Tiphany Adams Ability Awareness ProjectMy school presentations are designed to be as REAL as possible for the students. I work in an age-appropriate way to engage with them and talk about the impact of the accident and the drinking that caused it. I break down the myths of disability by showing kids how I can move in and out of my wheelchair, how I drive a fun vehicle (I bring either a Mustang or Silverado with hand controls) and how I have wheelchairs that allow me to stand up and stand out!No matter the age group we find there are always KEY QUESTIONS and ISSUES that naturally arise out of the discussions. I have a background in child development and psychology (college prior to Push Girls), and I use those skills to talk with students from preschool to college about what is on their mind. In addition to ability awareness, we talk about SERIOUS topics including real life disability questions (kids need to know life goes on and can be fun and fulfilling when you acquire or are born with a disability), the impact of drugs and alcohol, and addiction.We also talk about FUN stuff like what it’s REALLY like to be on reality television, plus film and fashion, red carpets, TV interviews, hair and makeup, and much much more.What is MOST IMPORTANT is that we always spend time talking about SELF-ACCEPTANCE. Learning to CELEBRATE who we are as individuals as we grow up and FOLLOW OUR DREAMS.Help Me Share the Ability Message at 10 Schools in the United States this Fall!Many schools do not have the funds to bring me to visit their students for a day - this fundraising project will raise funds so I can visit 10 schools in the United States this fall!$1,000 pays most of the costs associated with ONE FULL-DAY SCHOOL VISIT. This fee covers the costs of our presentation and materials (videos and giveaways). It also covers the travel expenses for me and one of my team members when the visit is within 3 hours drive distance of Los Angeles, CA. Outside of that region additional travel expenses may apply. We spend a full school day at each school and provide a general assembly as well as classroom visits. We also meet specifically with classes and student groups that focus on Film and TV, Fashion Design, LGBT, Gay/Straight Alliances, and Disabilities.For every $1,000 raised we will select a school to visit! Interested schools please visit my website at www.tiphanyadams.com for details on how to receive a Tiphany Adams Ability Awareness Project school visit!Any funds raised above our goal will be used to send us to more schools! Schools outside of our three hour drive radius are also eligible for a visit when they can underwrite the travel costs for me and one member of my team. See my website for details!You Can All Help!If you can't donate that's OK! Instead, help me spread the word about the TIPHANY ADAMS ABILITY AWARENESS PROJECT!

completed four contracts over two years as a cabaret dancer living and working in a completely
alien culture. Upon my return to Australia and in preparation to launch a pop
career in China, I was hit by a car whilst crossing a busy section of a highway in Melbourne, Australia.
I sustained a severe head injury and spent 4 weeks in a coma. </p><p>I had to learn
everything all over again: walking, talking, running, BEING.</p>
<p>I returned to my home town after intensive
rehabilitation and spent 10 years regaining my sense of self and purpose. I began to work in Disability Arts, a niche created for me! In
2009 I produced high quality circus workshops for children with and without disabilities to run during an international youth arts festival.</p><p>The week before the program launched I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.

me. </p><p>
I have confidence that my life experience is more than enough to qualify me as
someone who can share knowledge for the betterment of those listening. My keynote address will cover the breadth of my learning and realisations over these past 15 years. The ultimate aim is
to combine both performance and speech in order to present a finished product

<p>Developing a professional keynote
address that shall form the basis of my public speaking career. It is this I am
seeking to fund. I foresee it leading to my financial independence as well as
helping many others to overcome their difficulties.<br/><br/>
My keynote shall encapsulate the breadth of my learning and realisations over
these past 14 years and more. It is to be preceded by performance of the
theatre piece I am in the process of developing that has been funded by the
City Of Port Phillip up to now. Art is a gateway to healing. Using theatre to
open a subject that many find confronting can introduce the subject gently.</p>
<p>My public speaking project is focussed
upon the trajectory of my life with the lessons and gifts I have gained.
Presently working with Xanthe Beesley, a movement therapist and accomplished
theatre director in Melbourne, I am developing characterisation of stories
which have led me to where I stand today.<br/>
The ultimate aim is to combine both performance and speech in order to present
a finished product to inspire hope. In this I can provide tools and strategies
for overcoming perceived obstacles in life.</p>
<p>The finished product will be a
combination of the theatre, my keynote and a range of exercises delivered in a
workshop format to groups of people be they in a business or community sphere.
I intend to target a range of service providers and support services working
directly with survivors of trauma.</p>
<p>A quick look at my CV shows that I
have worked in a number of different capacities but all with a similar aim.
That is with the intention of enabling others to experience the transformative
nature of art. This has always been my passion and has led me to immerse myself
in a variety of roles working with a number of key arts and disability
organisations in Adelaide and Melbourne.</p>
<p>Some highlights that show dedication
and commitment to my career goals include: <i><span>Embryonic Zombie Butterfly</span></i> a portable
live performance art work characterising my trauma and recovery, Associate
Director, Other Film Festival (Arts Access Vic) I produced the ‘Sex, Love and
Intimacy’ Forum, Rag Theatre (all abilities theatre company) I was a volunteer
and participant, Artists in Schools Program, I produced a continuation of the
‘Roll Up Roll Up’ program at Mitcham Primary School, ‘Roll Up Roll Up’ Circus
Skills Workshops were delivered at Come Out ’09 International Youth Arts
Festival workshops -  circus skills development
workshops for integrated classes of primary school children with and without
disabilities. </p>
<p>Another
way I can demonstrate my commitment to my professional practice is to use the
example of being diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma at the commencement of the ‘Roll
Up Roll Up’ program. I remained dedicated to the project, attending a majority
of the workshops whilst beginning my chemotherapy.</p>

This year it's as near as St. Louis, MO! It's a 3 day conference in October with speakers from around the world, sharing experiences and encouraging growth in every facet of midwifery. I've been so excited about the whole process of watching this conference unfold. I will learn so much and have a once in a lifetime experience there, if only I can MAKE it. This is where you come in.

</ul><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","Natural Birth is My PassionI love birth and babies and families. I love serving women in all walks of life. I love contributing to a healthy start for families. I am excited for my future as a Certified Professional Midwife serving in Southwest Missouri, but that future seems far off as I try to fathom the expenses. I am grateful for the hand up I've been given in the past by my midwife, preceptor, and friend, Debbie Smithey. She has been so gracious and I love working with her and learning from her. As I try to fund my way through the certification process and attend educational retreats and conferences, though, I find my family's thin budget running dry. The Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) has an annual conference. This year it's as near as St. Louis, MO! It's a 3 day conference in October with speakers from around the world, sharing experiences and encouraging growth in every facet of midwifery. I've been so excited about the whole process of watching this conference unfold. I will learn so much and have a once in a lifetime experience there, if only I can MAKE it. This is where you come in. Will you contribute even a small donation to me so I can attend? Don't buy me Christmas, anniversary, or birthday gifts. Please contribute to my cause. Instead of sending me a card, send me the money you would have spent on that card.  I will be purchasing my registration via credit card, apply for the scholarship offered by MANA, and hope for the best. Even if I get the scholarship, though, I'll need to pay for other expenses.Update: I did not get the scholarship to pay for the conference fee. :( The need was high this year and I did not make the cut. So I'll keep campaigning and contributing my own money to get me there.   What I Need & What You GetHere's a breakdown of the cost of this conference.$350 Midwives Association of North America (MANA) conference student price for the whole 3 days, including breakfast and lunch$300 hotel fees for MANA conference. I'll be sharing a room with other attendees for at least 2 nights, possibly 3. The parking fee is outrageous. But staying there means less gas money driving to and from a different hotel or friend's house and less time wasted driving in St Louis traffic. Update: I have a place to stay! I'll need to budget more gas money, but this still saves me a ton!$150 Gas money for the trip. This is an estimate and I do plan to carpool, if possible.$50 Dinner money for 3 nightsTotal=$550If I earn more than my goal, I'll contribute the remainder to my certification process to NARM, the certifying body for the Certified Professional Midwife credential.If I don't earn at least $300, I'll use all the money for my certification.And you get perks!For every $15 you donate, I'll send you a picture of me in action, either with a client (who could say no to sweet babies?!) or spending time at the conference.If you're so dedicated to me that you send $100, in addition to several photos, I'll show my appreciation with a box of fine chocolates!The ImpactGuys, I'm really excited about this conference. I'm passionate about my path in life. Right now, money is super tight. I'll be making contributions to my own future, but I do need some help. My husband already works full-time with overtime and is starting his own business.

Maddi imkanım olamadığı için ne yazık ki 8 yıl yatalak yaşamak zorunda kaldım. Ama bu 8 yıl içinde hayattan asla kopmadım. Hayata daha sıkı bağlandım. Yaşam gücümü hiçbir zaman için kaybetmedim ve iyileşeceğime çok inandım. Tutmayan ellerimle resimler yaptım, şiirler yazdım, şarkılar yaptım. Küçücük bir odayı kocaman bir dünyaya çevirdim. Benim bu yaşam mücadelemi ve çabalarımı duyan İzmir Eski Büyük Şehir Belediye başkanı Sayın Burhan Özfatura bir kampanya başlattı ve bu kampanyada yaptığım bütün resimler satıldı, pek çok yardımsever bana yardım etti ve toplanan parayla İngiltere'de Royal Bucks Hospital'a gönderildim.

Türkiyede kök hücre tedavisi olmayınca vazgeçmeyeceğim için tekrar dünyadaki kök hücre merkezleriyle yazışmaya başladım. çünkü kök hücrenin işe yaradığını görmüştüm. ve bu benim için umuttu. 6 ülke ile görüştüm, Amerika, İsrail, iran, almanya, Ukrayna ve çin. hepsiyle yazıştım, hepsine raporlarımı gönderdim, bana en iyi sonucu verebilecek doktorlar olarak, çindeki doktorların söylemleri çok iyi geldi. ve hatta oraya gidip iyileşen bir hasta ile görüştüm. ve bundan emin olduğum için oraya gitmeye karar verdim, ve bütün raporlarımı, belgelerimi herşeyi doktorlara gönderdim. doktorlar uzun bir incelemeden sonra 4021 kişi içinden, 121 kişi seçilen grupta beni de tedaviye kabul ettiler. maddi imkanım yeterli olmadığı için, ben cumhurbaşkanımıza, başbakanımıza ve sağlık bakanlığına yazı yazdım ve tedaviye gitmek istediğimi belirttim. sağolsun cumhurbaşkanımız benim bu isteğimi sağlık bakanlığına ilettiler ve sağlık bakanlığı tedavime gönderme sözü verdi. ama öncelikle izmirde bir hastaneden heyetten rapor almak gerektiğini bildirildi. ben de bu doğrultuda izmir tepeceğik eğitim ve araştırma hastanesine yönlendirildim.

<p>---------------------------------- UPDATE -------------------------------------------</p>
<p>We have completed Round 1 of interviews for our part-time Program Coordinator role &amp; we are excited to meet them all in-person in 1 week!</p>
<p>That's right... we leave in 1 week and thanks to all of our amazing supporters, we are ALMOST at our goal!! This is amazing and we are so excited to get back to Tanzania, deliver thousands of books to hundreds of students, hire our a first team member, and start planning for a bigger, even more impactful 2013!</p>
<p>Thank you to all of those who have contributed thus far.... we are SO CLOSE!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/453881/pictures/full/20120921124359-thank_you.jpg?1348256692"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Thank You!""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Do you remember the first book you owned?  Or your first day of school?  If you are like us, it’s likely that you have had a book or two at your disposal since before you even knew how to read.  It wasn’t until our trip to Tanzania that we were able to put our fortune into perspective.</p>
<p>In 2010, we lived in Arusha, Tanzania and volunteered at CHETI School (a private school outside of Arusha).  Tanzania is a peaceful country in East Africa.  In Tanzania, 89% of people live below the poverty line and appx. 8% of the population is HIV positive.  As a result, education often takes a back seat to other things, as families either can’t afford to pay for it (even public education is costly) or because children are forced to stay home to care for other family members (often losing one or both parents to HIV).   </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/398213/pictures/full/20120820185232-188568_10100223850343962_3211023_n.jpg?1345513980"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Soon after the first volunteer trip in 2010, Cheti, a 501c3 organization whose mission it is to strengthen the local economies in Tanzania, was founded.  Shortly after, a dynamic team of past CHETI volunteers came together, dedicating endless hours to making Cheti a success. Erica was still in Africa and quickly got involved on the ground.  First step - meet and sponsor Marietta Charles!</p>
<p><img alt=""Erica and Marietta!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JtV1xOmhvL4/TC31UlImWzI/AAAAAAAAC8A/OfnUeOP7Z9U/s490/DSCF1276.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""Erica and Marietta!""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, Cheti is empowering local citizens by sponsoring education, providing start up resources, and engaging the community. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/398200/pictures/full/20120820184031-IMG_2230.JPG?1345513239"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In two years, Cheti has already made an impact in the community.  With the help of many volunteers and generous donations, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Established new facilities in Arusha – including purchasing the land, buying building material, and building 8 new classrooms</li>
<li>Sponsored 80 students within two school networks, ensuring them education through primary school (12 years old)</li>
<li>Administered 80 HIV tests to students</li>
<li>Purchased 2 school buses to ensure all students can make it to school, despite tenuous weather conditions</li>
<li>Provided over 450 meals to students</li>
<li>Impacted over 1000 people, including students, parents, teachers, and community members</li>
</ul><p>As one CHETI School parent recently said   “Because my daughter has a sponsor, I was able to give my family a nice meal on Easter for the first time.”</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/398201/pictures/full/20120820184051-IMG_2389.JPG?1345513274"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>Now, its time to take Cheti to the next level.  We have been a lean group so far and are focused on creating a sustainable organization for the future.  What does this mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>We are expanding our reach by adding schools</li>
<li>We are building our local team</li>
<li>We are increasing the capacity of our current staff by implementing more scalable infrastructure </li>
</ul><p>Sounds like something you want to be a part of?  </p>
<p>We are heading back to Arusha this fall to work closely with our schools and to hire a local coordinator who can help manage our programs on the ground.  </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What are we raising money for?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>$3,500</strong></strong> towards a school bus for our partner school, Jue. Jue School is ranked #3 in the region and #16 in the country of Tanzania. We are helping them build new classrooms and a new orphanage so they can take in twice as many (100) orphans into their school! They need this bus desperately to transport the children from their homes to the new school. </p>
<p><strong>$4,500</strong> will go to 2 flights to Tanzania, room/board for 2 weeks (1 for our President &amp; Founder, and 1 for our Board Member and prior CHETI School volunteer).</p>
<p><strong>$2,000</strong> will go to hiring a local, part-time coordinator for the next year. We will be interviewing candidates during this trip that meet our job description requirements and can begin to help facilitate the management of our programs.</p>

<p><strong>Well, this campaign is now over. We did not raise the whole amount but thanks to those who funded it is a start. I will be able to at least be able to make a down payment so this bought me a little more time to find more money somewhere. Thank you to all of those that looked at my campaign and those who shared my story and worry. It means a lot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>After years of juggling family, school, and work I was finally going to get my Bachelor of Arts in Music. Everything was going great, then tragedy struck when one day a policeman came to my house with a message from my sister, who couldn't reach my cell phone, me living in a dead zone. Our mother had just passed from a sudden heart attack. She meant so much to both my sister and me because she was a single mother from the time we were 6 months old. To me, she was my only parent and suddenly she was gone. This sudden loss really affected my focus in all aspects of my life which left me facing deadlines I could not meet. I turned in what I had for classes, but it was not enough and I failed two classes that I absolutely need for graduation. These two classes are only available in the fall. I am out of financial aid eligibility. My wife and I would have had the money to pay for these last six credit hours out of pocket, but because my mother did not have enough in savings or a life insurance policy, we had to pay for half of the funeral costs. Our half was $4000+ which we have paid already. With me working 30 hours a week at night as a cook and my wife working 35 hours during the school year as a teacher's aide, we make just enough money to scrape by on living expenses, which is fine, but there is no way we can afford to pay for my college too. I have been applying for second jobs also but have so far not been hired.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Breakin' it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need $1800 which breaks down like this:
<ul>
<li>$1300 for half time tuition and fees</li>
<li>$295 for Sibelius Academic Student Edition music notation software for a class</li>
<li>$200 misc. school supplies and indiegogo.com fees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perks:</li>
<li>$1 and you get a high five, hanshake, or hug, your choice, not matter who you are! I don't even have to know you!</li>
<li>$5 will get you a hand written thank you note (that's right, I can write words too!)</li>
<li>$10 gets you the thank you note and a printed copy of sheet music of a melodic excerpt from one of my original compositions.</li>
<li>$25 you get the thank you note and the sheet music for an entire original composition.</li>
<li>$50 gets you all of the above plus a midi or mp3 of that composition as well as the right to email me at least weekly for an update on my progress without me getting frustrated with you or being snippy.</li>
<li>$100 will get you all of the other perks at lower prices plus a short song composed by me for you on any subject you designate in any style you want. Who doesn't need their own theme music? (must be 3 instruments or less and not be longer than 2 minutes in length, so don't ask for me to compose your requiem.)</li>
<li>$1800 I WILL COMPOSE YOUR REQUIEM, or anything else you like, no holds barred, nothing off limits, no out of bounds! I am yours!</li>
<li>All funds will go toward my education if my goal is not reached. If more than my goal is reached all of the excess money will pay for expenses for auditioning away from home such as travel, hotel, food, getting my clarinet serviced, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Meeting this funding will make it possible for me to achieve my goal and bring me one step closer to realizing my dream of supporting my family through my love of music. I want to show my 3 kids that it is possible to pursue your goals in life and actually achieve them no matter what is thrown in your way.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I know some people can't afford to help fund this, but you can still help. Get the word out; let your friends, family, coworkers, anyone you know know about this effort. Email, facebook, twitter, whatever.</p>

<p>Dear Family and Friends,<br/><br/>As some of you may know I have been recently selected as a StartingBloc Social Innovation Fellow for 2010. <strong>What is StartingBloc and why should you care?</strong> So glad you asked! <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">StartingBloc</span> is a non- profit organization that takes students and young professionals (aged 20-29) and provides them with the training, education, and networks necessary to turn any career into a socially responsible one.  Fellows learn about corporate social responsibility, social entrepreneurship, cross sector partnerships and sustainability from leading academics, corporate innovators, social entrepreneurs, activists and government officials. The curriculum provides a fresh look at global issues and enables fellows to innovatively affect change at all levels.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now <strong>you're probably saying to yourself, ""LC say no more, You had me at ""StartingBloc is…"", so how do I help?!?!"" </strong> Well it's pretty simple, really: the tuition for this program is $1000 (way beyond my meager non-profit salary means)! Unlike many other organizations and programs that I've been a part of, StartingBloc does not offer scholarships... instead they challenge their fellows to be entrepreneurial and raise their tuition themselves. With you help, I think I can do just that. Consider supporting my StartingBloc adventure in one of a couple of different ways:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><br/>A) <strong>Make a donation</strong> towards my goal of raising $1200* to cover my institute fees, airfare (ok, make that bus fare), and a place to sleep other than in an cardboard box.</p>
</div>
<p><em>*Please please please consider making a donation, you don't know how much it would mean to me to know I have your vote of confidence that I have what it takes to help make our world a better place.</em></p>

</div></div>","Dear Family and Friends,As some of you may know I have been recently selected as a StartingBloc Social Innovation Fellow for 2010. What is StartingBloc and why should you care? So glad you asked! StartingBloc is a non- profit organization that takes students and young professionals (aged 20-29) and provides them with the training, education, and networks necessary to turn any career into a socially responsible one.  Fellows learn about corporate social responsibility, social entrepreneurship, cross sector partnerships and sustainability from leading academics, corporate innovators, social entrepreneurs, activists and government officials. The curriculum provides a fresh look at global issues and enables fellows to innovatively affect change at all levels.  
 
Now you're probably saying to yourself, ""LC say no more, You had me at ""StartingBloc is…"", so how do I help?!?!""  Well it's pretty simple, really: the tuition for this program is $1000 (way beyond my meager non-profit salary means)! Unlike many other organizations and programs that I've been a part of, StartingBloc does not offer scholarships... instead they challenge their fellows to be entrepreneurial and raise their tuition themselves. With you help, I think I can do just that. Consider supporting my StartingBloc adventure in one of a couple of different ways:


A) Make a donation towards my goal of raising $1200* to cover my institute fees, airfare (ok, make that bus fare), and a place to sleep other than in an cardboard box.

*Please please please consider making a donation, you don't know how much it would mean to me to know I have your vote of confidence that I have what it takes to help make our world a better place.

B) If you live in Boston, let's hangout!  The institute takes place May 24-28 so let's plan something! 
 
C) Send some words of encouragement! Pursuing a crazy dream of changing the world is not for the weak of heart. It always mean a lot to know I have great folks in my corner. 
 
D) All of the above :)",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Hello World</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Paul Gomez. I am the director of a new English language school in Novi Sad, Serbia. I am calling the school American Spirit...because...Americans are, from the beginning, told that we are free to follow our dreams. Sure, manifesting is more difficult that chasing, but we are empowered to go for it, and even embrace the difficulties.</p>
<p>My latest big idea is to open a school. To make things right, I need tables, chairs, and a big chalkboard. I don't want a white board. An old school slate number will suit my needs best. Resources in Novi Sad are rare and expensive, so I decided to come here for a little financial assistance.</p>
<p>Your contribution will enable me to install the furniture I need to make things classy and comfortable. The more I am able to raise, the better I will be able to outfit my school.</p>
<p>When people talk about the comprehensive and even extraordinary nature of the American education system, the idea of ""being well funded"" is often brought up. I think that's because resources are half the battle, so to speak. A teacher can possess language skills and the imagination needed to teach, but without a good space to teach in, and money to keep it up, that teacher is limited in their ability to convey the information.</p>
<p>I spent a year teaching on a freelance basis at various private language schools around the city, and now I'm ready to open my own place. I plan on exercising a little modern pedagogy and ideology regarding knowledge and the aquisition of information, just to keep things lively.</p>
<p>The idea is to help the citizens of Novi Sad learn English, and to teach them that they can also follow their dreams.</p>
<p>I am using the name American Spirit because it represents power, invididuality, resourcefulness, bravery, and a little fancy flashy business while charging into your destiny.</p>

<h3>We need YOUR help to bring this dream back to reality!</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to get everything we need to create the best possible place both to play and to watch great live music. Here is what we need and why:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the world's a stage, but why not build one too?</li>
<li>LIGHTS! LASER BEAMS! PROJECTORS! TELEPORTER! (patent pending)</li>
<li>Custom venue merch with signature artwork so you can take us with you!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here are some, but certainly not all, of the ideas we have for this new space:</p>
<ul>
<li>New and exciting social space to make great new friends and hang with old friends all under one roof</li>
<li>Bringing new art and music to Fort Smith and the greater Northwest Arkansas region, as well as old favorites we all know and love</li>
<li>Creating a home for all of the things and people we love in the world, and having fun during the process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This place will be a collective effort to enrich all of our lives, and can only be as great as we choose to make it.</p>
<ul>
<li>With over two decades of combined experience on both sides of the stage, we know exactly what both bands and fans want from a venue and have every intention to exceed all expectations. This can be expensive, but with your help we can make this happen!</li>
<li>Our plan is to create a place where the crowd and bands can depart from their lives one night at a time to create something truly amazing for everyone involved</li>

This place will be a collective effort to enrich all of our lives, and can only be as great as we choose to make it.

With over two decades of combined experience on both sides of the stage, we know exactly what both bands and fans want from a venue and have every intention to exceed all expectations. This can be expensive, but with your help we can make this happen!
Our plan is to create a place where the crowd and bands can depart from their lives one night at a time to create something truly amazing for everyone involved


Other Ways You Can Help
Don't have cash? That's fine! There are plenty of ways to help such as sharing and mentioning our cause to everyone you know!
Thank you all immensely for your help and consideration!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, <a href=""http://www.washingtontowashington.org/wp-content/gallery/2012-trip-photos/jamesdavy.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Davy Rothbart and James Molenda</a> here! We're the editors of <a href=""http://foundmagazine.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FOUND Magazine</a>, and each summer - with the generous help of friends like you - we put together a camping trip for inner-city kids called <a href=""http://www.washingtontowashington.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Washington II Washington</a>. Thank you so much for checking out the short video above, and contributing what you can to help this summer's trip come to life!</p>
<p>Washington II Washington is an annual hiking adventure taking city kids from Washington, D.C., Southeast Michigan, and New Orleans on a week-long camping and hiking trip to explore some of the country's most beautiful wilderness areas. Along the way, these kids will see animals they didn't know existed, swim in fresh, crisp lake water, make their own S’mores as we all tell ghost stories around a campfire they've just learned to make, learn camping and wilderness skills, and explore the Great Outdoors!</p>
<p>Last year, the kids had a blast taking in <a href=""https://vimeo.com/133395470"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the breathtaking views from atop Twin Islands Peak</a> in western Virginia's George Washington National Forest. Some of the highlights included finding a hidden swimming hole deep in the forest and meeting new animal friends, both big (DEER!) and small (SKUNKS!) alike. This year, we'll journey to two of Michigan's pristine wilderness areas — the Waterloo Recreation Area and Warren Dunes State Park — where we'll swim in Lake Michigan, canoe the Huron River, hike the summit of Mt. Randall, camp outdoors, and keep our eyes peeled for even more hidden treasures!</p>

Hello, Davy Rothbart and James Molenda here! We're the editors of FOUND Magazine, and each summer - with the generous help of friends like you - we put together a camping trip for inner-city kids called Washington II Washington. Thank you so much for checking out the short video above, and contributing what you can to help this summer's trip come to life!
Washington II Washington is an annual hiking adventure taking city kids from Washington, D.C., Southeast Michigan, and New Orleans on a week-long camping and hiking trip to explore some of the country's most beautiful wilderness areas. Along the way, these kids will see animals they didn't know existed, swim in fresh, crisp lake water, make their own S’mores as we all tell ghost stories around a campfire they've just learned to make, learn camping and wilderness skills, and explore the Great Outdoors!

Some of the highlights included finding a hidden swimming hole deep in the forest and meeting new animal friends, both big (DEER!) and small (SKUNKS!) alike. This year, we'll journey to two of Michigan's pristine wilderness areas — the Waterloo Recreation Area and Warren Dunes State Park — where we'll swim in Lake Michigan, canoe the Huron River, hike the summit of Mt. Randall, camp outdoors, and keep our eyes peeled for even more hidden treasures!

the moment we have 3 building sites on the go:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p align=""justify""><b>The
	completion of the Eurythmy/multifunctional room.</b>
	 We have been building this space since 2013.  It is connected to
	the school and adjacent to the gym. At the moment it is at an
	advanced unfinished state inside but fully finished externally. <b>For
	completion the space needs all internal fittings: flooring,
	electrics and heating.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So
	far all the work has been done by members of the co-operative; once
	finished however <b>it will remain the property of the local council
</b>	and will be available for use<b> not only by the school but by the
	local community</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>New
	secretarial office and classroom. </b><span>At
	the moment the secretarial office is located on the first floor. 
	This project aims to build a new office on the ground floor next to
	the eurythmy/multifunctional room. For the time being, only the
	foundations have been laid. <b> Everything needs to be done both
	internally and externally.</b></span>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	However by moving the office
	downstairs and removing an internal wall between the old office and
	a small box room, the space upstairs could then be transformed into
	a much needed new classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align=""justify""><b>Extraordinary maintenance of the building. </b><span>To the expansion works it has become necessary to do some extraordinary maintenance on the school building including changing some of the windows, replastering of external walls,  insulation, modernization and modifying of the heating system.  </span></p>

spaces as well as to the general maintenance of the buildings. The
entire property on the school grounds is  run by our co-operative
which oversees all building works and therefore uses private funds to
maintain and improve public spaces owned by the local council.






We
are expanding our current spaces to create a new space suitable for
the teaching of Eurythmy, but which would be large enough to be used
for  shows and conferences open to the general public.  Our school
has grown in number and all the spaces previously available have been
occupied  as classrooms.  To teach Eurythmy, an artistic discipline
fundamental for the healthy growth of our children, we have been
having to use a room external to the school buildings.  A room that
has been kindly lent to us by the community of Borgnano.
Added
to this expansion, this last academic year, we have had to modernize
some safety features of the school buildings.



So
far, as well as the practical help volunteered by our co-operative
members, we have spent 45.000 euro which was raised by members, their
families and friends._____________________________________________________________________________

We
have now run out of resources and have decided to ask for your help!_____________________________________________________________________________We about 60.000 USD  to complete our plans....
and hope to raise 
 through this project on IndieGoGo.com
_____________________________________________________________________________






The old school buildings of
Borgnano are an essential part of a  historic village and its
interplay between work, rest and nature. Our project does not just
have the short term aim of building newer, safer spaces for the
immediate future; it also aims to preserve this centuries old
relationship.  In other words our project aims to give new life to a
well established reality, maintaining it for the general use and 
well being of future generations. 

At
the moment we have 3 building sites on the go:



The
	completion of the Eurythmy/multifunctional room.
	 We have been building this space since 2013.  It is connected to
	the school and adjacent to the gym. At the moment it is at an
	advanced unfinished state inside but fully finished externally. For
	completion the space needs all internal fittings: flooring,
	electrics and heating.
So
	far all the work has been done by members of the co-operative; once
	finished however it will remain the property of the local council
	and will be available for use not only by the school but by the
	local community.


New
	secretarial office and classroom. At
	the moment the secretarial office is located on the first floor. 
	This project aims to build a new office on the ground floor next to
	the eurythmy/multifunctional room. For the time being, only the
	foundations have been laid.  Everything needs to be done both
	internally and externally.

	However by moving the office
	downstairs and removing an internal wall between the old office and
	a small box room, the space upstairs could then be transformed into
	a much needed new classroom.


Extraordinary maintenance of the building. To the expansion works it has become necessary to do some extraordinary maintenance on the school building including changing some of the windows, replastering of external walls,  insulation, modernization and modifying of the heating system.  



You can view the costs of the various stages are by clicking here_____________________________________________________________________________



Considering
the sizable large sum, we have decided to look for funds in 2 ways :



An international campaign on this present site IndieGoGo.com,
which aims to collect the 37.000.- USD  needed to complete a main part of the
works .

A second Italian campaign to raise the rest of the funds can be found by clicking   HERE..

Self-Directed and Democratic Education is illegal, while the rigid state curriculum is compulsory. Even the Greek newspaper, Kathimerini, states: “It’s a completely outdated system that is totally divorced from society’s real needs.” But a collective of young families and educators is setting out to catalyse change through Nature Play – an innovative, non-formal education startup on the island of Evia, in Central Greece – and EUDEC Greece; a network for Self-Directed and Democratic Education initiatives across the nation.</p><h3>Why are we doing this?</h3><p>Motivated by love for our children, and for nature – and inspired by the exponential growth of <a href=""http://agilelearningcenters.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Agile Learning Centres</a> in the USA – Nature Play is seeking to cultivate a vibrant and colourful social movement behind this and many other inspiring approaches to Self-Directed and Democratic Education here on the stunning island of Evia in Central Greece. You’d be forgiven for not having heard of it. It’s an underdeveloped rural area and an undiscovered island paradise — all wrapped up in one — that’s only a 2 hour drive from Athens, a major European hub.</p><p><strong>After our success in convening Europe’s first ever Agile Learning Facilitator training in 2017, we’re back to take our growing community to the next level.</strong> This campaign is your invitation to help us kickstart an emerging social movement by training a core group of committed and talented families and educators in Agile Learning Facilitation - an innovative approach to Self-Directed and Democratic Education which leverages the same agile management tools that power companies like Google and Netflix.</p><p>This time ‘round, Nature Play is collaborating with <a href=""https://eudec.gr/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EUDEC Greece</a>, the brand new regional chapter of the European Democratic Education Community (EUDEC) - a non-profit promoting democratic education across Europe.</p><p>Because something special is stirring in our hearts and minds, and of those that support us.

An Agile Learning Centre (ALC) doesn’t have a traditional curriculum. Instead, it teaches children and young people to navigate the world by cultivating core competencies in entrepreneurialism, digital literacy, resourcefulness, efficient collaboration, collective decision-making and self-directed initiative. We’re inspired by this innovative approach to Self-Directed Education, but also committed to staying firmly rooted in the lineage of Democratic Education from which ALF emerged (and the European Democratic Education Community of which EUDEC Greece is a part).</p><div>

</div><h3>Why Agile Learning Facilitator trainings?</h3><p>When it comes to teaching and learning, the medium is the message. In order to teach honesty, respect, authenticity, initiative, self-direction, follow-through, purpose, and shareable value, you must embody these traits. And so, we’ll be learning from those leading the way in the ALF field.

It shows the simple model we've developed over the last twelve months, by which the income generated from these trainings is distributed to our support network of people and projects both locally on North Evia (for example, to pay the farming collectives who supply us with fresh produce and our host venue, Stagones Nature Camp) and further afield (for example, to cover the travel expenses of our lead ALF's). Our aim is to develop an open source business model that is sustainable and scalable —built upon the long established and rigorously democratic principles of the social and solidarity economy —where risks and rewards are shared equitably by the entire stakeholder community. However, in the interests of financial transparency we feel it is important to state plainly that:</p><ol>
<li>Nature Play ALC is not currently generating any profit from these activities<strong>.</strong> Like so many others, we are instead making a significant investment in time, money and other resources to help grow the Self-Directed and Democratic Education movement here in Greece.</li>
<li>Nature Play ALC does not stand to benefit financially from this Access Fund. Setting it up—and thereby making scholarship places available for Greek families and educators on low incomes—is in fact reducing the gross income generated from these trainings, for which demand has been consistently high since August 2017. </li>

This Union is in essence a non-profit association that will facilitate the collective legal representation of families and educators who are ready and willing to unite around our inalienable human right to free choice in education.

We need your support to raise a €2,000 Access Fund for a series of catalytic trainings in Agile Learning Facilitation, as well as a €1,000 Impact Fund for the startup phase of a Greek Union for Free Choice in Education. The goal is simple — to kick-start the Self-Directed and Democratic Education movement in Greece. Join us – Nature Play and EUDEC Greece – as we embark on the learning adventure of a lifetime.In the land that birthed Western civilisation......the education system is in shambles. Self-Directed and Democratic Education is illegal, while the rigid state curriculum is compulsory. Even the Greek newspaper, Kathimerini, states: “It’s a completely outdated system that is totally divorced from society’s real needs.” But a collective of young families and educators is setting out to catalyse change through Nature Play – an innovative, non-formal education startup on the island of Evia, in Central Greece – and EUDEC Greece; a network for Self-Directed and Democratic Education initiatives across the nation.Why are we doing this?Motivated by love for our children, and for nature – and inspired by the exponential growth of Agile Learning Centres in the USA – Nature Play is seeking to cultivate a vibrant and colourful social movement behind this and many other inspiring approaches to Self-Directed and Democratic Education here on the stunning island of Evia in Central Greece. You’d be forgiven for not having heard of it. It’s an underdeveloped rural area and an undiscovered island paradise — all wrapped up in one — that’s only a 2 hour drive from Athens, a major European hub.After our success in convening Europe’s first ever Agile Learning Facilitator training in 2017, we’re back to take our growing community to the next level. This campaign is your invitation to help us kickstart an emerging social movement by training a core group of committed and talented families and educators in Agile Learning Facilitation - an innovative approach to Self-Directed and Democratic Education which leverages the same agile management tools that power companies like Google and Netflix.This time ‘round, Nature Play is collaborating with EUDEC Greece, the brand new regional chapter of the European Democratic Education Community (EUDEC) - a non-profit promoting democratic education across Europe.Because something special is stirring in our hearts and minds, and of those that support us. But first things first...What is Agile Learning?Agile Learning Facilitation (ALF) is a holistic approach that restores the joy of learning; cultivating confidence, intrinsic motivation, dynamic skill sets, mental agility, self-awareness, and group skills. An Agile Learning Centre (ALC) doesn’t have a traditional curriculum. Instead, it teaches children and young people to navigate the world by cultivating core competencies in entrepreneurialism, digital literacy, resourcefulness, efficient collaboration, collective decision-making and self-directed initiative. We’re inspired by this innovative approach to Self-Directed Education, but also committed to staying firmly rooted in the lineage of Democratic Education from which ALF emerged (and the European Democratic Education Community of which EUDEC Greece is a part).

 
Why Agile Learning Facilitator trainings?When it comes to teaching and learning, the medium is the message. In order to teach honesty, respect, authenticity, initiative, self-direction, follow-through, purpose, and shareable value, you must embody these traits. And so, we’ll be learning from those leading the way in the ALF field. People who have many years of hands-on experience working with kids and starting-up ALC’s from scratch in places like the US and Cairo. Think deep dives, Q&A’s, role-playing, behaviour modelling and so much more. It’s a bit like riding a bicycle — we will only learn by doing!Hello I’m Marcus. I’m a co-founder of Nature Play ALC and the person responsible for fundraising at EUDEC Greece.From a EUDEC Greece perspective, this campaign is our way of saying ‘hello world’ whilst raising an Access Fund and an Impact Fund to help us get our change-making vision off the ground. Our mission is simple: to tell a new story of Self-Directed and Democratic Education in Greece, hand in hand with the next generation!Meanwhile—together with my wife, Emily—we set up Nature Play to help catalyse real change in education. But we’re starting small, putting one foot in front of the other.As coordinators of this project, we like to think we’re intrinsically motivated since we have 4 and 1 year old boys to keep us focused!

What does Nature Play actually do?
We’re an Agile Learning Community who run weekend trainings, summer camps and nature exploration days, inspired by the assumptions, principles and toolkit of Agile Learning Facilitation. Discover more about this exponentially growing global network here.
We’re a non-formal education collective. Inspired by Wild + Free in the US, we’re committed to co-creating a transformative learning community of our own right here on Evia.
We need your support to help kick-start an emerging social movement by engaging a core group of committed and talented families and educators in an intensive training programme in Greece this summer.
This series of transformative trainings will empower Nature Play — as well as other education startups just like us in Athens and on islands like Crete and Paros — to make more regular offerings to learners of all ages, from weekly Nature Days to monthly ALF Weekends, pre-school groups to youth clubs!The TrainingsIt’s hard to overstate the importance of our annual ALF Summer training intensives, as well as our monthly ALF Weekends. They’re just hugely important!Because #1, we get to learn how the model works from leading practitioners — specialists in Self-Directed and Democratic Education with years of hands-on experience working with kids and starting-up ALC’s from scratch in the US and Cairo. Think deep dives, Q&A’s, role-modelling and so much more. It’s like riding a bicycle — we will only learn by doing!And because #2, these regular gatherings have become the platform from which experience is shared and trust is established by a network of pioneering Self-Directed and Democratic Education practitioners here in Greece. Trust and shared experience is the fabric of community, and thanks to these Weekends the embryonic form of a vibrant social movement is beginning to emerge!Where does my money go?Your pledges will directly support:Twelve places on a mini-series of ALF Weekends in June and July. An ALF Weekend is an invaluable taste and see experience offering families and educators an immersive, playful experience of Agile Learning Facilitation. We hope they will serve as an incubator for an emerging network of Self-Directed and Democratic Education projects in Greece.Six places on our annual ALF Summer Greece. An ALF Summer is the ALC network’s long-established training intensive. It offers an experiential + exponential learning curve in Self-Directed Education and Intentional Culture Creation (a kind of democratic process). These bursary places will specifically target pioneering individuals and families who’re ready to put this training into practice in their local places, but who are unable to participate, simply because of lack of money. Are you committed to financial transparency?We hope the Pie Chart above is helpful! It shows the simple model we've developed over the last twelve months, by which the income generated from these trainings is distributed to our support network of people and projects both locally on North Evia (for example, to pay the farming collectives who supply us with fresh produce and our host venue, Stagones Nature Camp) and further afield (for example, to cover the travel expenses of our lead ALF's). Our aim is to develop an open source business model that is sustainable and scalable —built upon the long established and rigorously democratic principles of the social and solidarity economy —where risks and rewards are shared equitably by the entire stakeholder community. However, in the interests of financial transparency we feel it is important to state plainly that:
Nature Play ALC is not currently generating any profit from these activities. Like so many others, we are instead making a significant investment in time, money and other resources to help grow the Self-Directed and Democratic Education movement here in Greece.
Nature Play ALC does not stand to benefit financially from this Access Fund. Setting it up—and thereby making scholarship places available for Greek families and educators on low incomes—is in fact reducing the gross income generated from these trainings, for which demand has been consistently high since August 2017. 
What about this EUDEC Greece Start-up Fund?Beyond Nature Play ALC’s all-important trainings, EUDEC Greece is starting up as a Democratic Education network campaigning for Free Choice and Democracy in Education on behalf of families and educators all over Greece.Specifically, 1/3rd of the total amount raised will fund the startup phase of a Greek registered Union for Free Choice in Education, paying for all kinds of things including legal fees, graphic and web development and other business critical professional services. This Union is in essence a non-profit association that will facilitate the collective legal representation of families and educators who are ready and willing to unite around our inalienable human right to free choice in education. Moving beyond the scope of EUDEC Greece's legal identity as a regional chapter of the European Democratic Education Community—which is, in fact, a German registered NGO—we urgently need this Greek registered Union in order to establish a basis in Greek law for the protection of and advocacy for all families and educators who choose Self-Directed and Democratic Education options.We’ve got dozens of families and individuals all over Greece who are already signed up to become founding members. But like so many good things which are ready to thrive here in Greece, money remains an obstacle. All we need now is a financial boost to get this campaign up and running. And that’s why we’re here asking you to join the adventure!AKA What cool stuff and transformative experiences we can give you, in exchange for the hard cash you can give us!

If you made a donation prior to 9/17/12 you are being offered  a refund of your donation. We still need the money but I will not do anything under false pretenses and while they were not false when I started this campain, the situation has changed.</p>
<p>This is my story:</p>
<p>My name is Kristen Petroff and I own Abington Kids Creative Arts Studio in Abington, PA. I have a background in running small businesses and have spent most of my life as an independent bookkeeper running up to 30 companies a month. One day I realized that I cared more about my clients businesses than they did and decided to quit bookkeeping and open up a children’s arts studio.</p>
<p>I LOVE the Arts and bringing them to my community and their children is very important to me. I used to dance, I still paint and make jewelry. I adore any project with wood or mosaics and just learned how to cut and grind glass.</p>
<p>My campaign was to save my studio. Now it is to pay my employees as some have not taken a paycheck in almost 2 months. I rent a great space in Abington, it is open, warm and inviting and now I have a year lease and no way to pay it.  When we first opened, I had a dream of 3 month long classes to really be able to teach children true art. Well, that didn't work. We then changed the program to a free form arts program. When we did that, Groupon found us which was a blessing and a curse. It gave us exposure but turned us into a daycare. After our Summer Camps were over we decided to go back to the original idea but 1 month classes. A lot of our parents, even the ones who asked us for this are not supporting us because most of them came in on a coupon and they just wanted the discounts. We cannot survive like that anymore and we are not going to.</p>
<p>We need $15,000.00, hell, now that I am closing, I need more but I will accept what I can, to, in order; pay my employees, provide refunds to clients (less than $100), pay rents, studio bills and the loan I personally guaranteed for the business.</p>
<p>If we get over our amount, whther or not all the bills are paid, at least my employees will be, I will buy art supplies for the local schools.</p>
<p>As far as perks go, they will be set up to thank you, thank you and thank you some more for your contribution. Perks will include original handmade jewelry, original paintings by myself or my amazing staff. Each piece of art created is unique and beautiful!!</p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal and get partially funded, the money will go to pay my staff, refunds, rent, studio bills, in that order...</p>
<p>We believe that Art has a purpose. Art shows us different views of the world as we see it. That not everything is black and white, instead the world is filled with all of this amazing color and you can do whatever you want to with it. With so many schools taking away art and music, we DID find a way to make it accessible to everyone. It has been proven that the arts helps children in math, English and other classes. Art can raise test scores for students. Art is just good for everyone, even if they are only exposed for a short period of time, it can change the way you view the world.</p>
<p>If you love the Arts and cannot contribute monetarily, share us, tell a friend, do whatever you can. Art IS Important to everyone!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p></div>","Disclaimer: We have had to change the campaign. If you made a donation prior to 9/17/12 you are being offered  a refund of your donation. We still need the money but I will not do anything under false pretenses and while they were not false when I started this campain, the situation has changed.
This is my story:
My name is Kristen Petroff and I own Abington Kids Creative Arts Studio in Abington, PA. I have a background in running small businesses and have spent most of my life as an independent bookkeeper running up to 30 companies a month. One day I realized that I cared more about my clients businesses than they did and decided to quit bookkeeping and open up a children’s arts studio.
I LOVE the Arts and bringing them to my community and their children is very important to me. I used to dance, I still paint and make jewelry. I adore any project with wood or mosaics and just learned how to cut and grind glass.
My campaign was to save my studio. Now it is to pay my employees as some have not taken a paycheck in almost 2 months. I rent a great space in Abington, it is open, warm and inviting and now I have a year lease and no way to pay it.  When we first opened, I had a dream of 3 month long classes to really be able to teach children true art. Well, that didn't work. We then changed the program to a free form arts program. When we did that, Groupon found us which was a blessing and a curse. It gave us exposure but turned us into a daycare.

A lot of our parents, even the ones who asked us for this are not supporting us because most of them came in on a coupon and they just wanted the discounts. We cannot survive like that anymore and we are not going to.

If we get over our amount, whther or not all the bills are paid, at least my employees will be, I will buy art supplies for the local schools.
As far as perks go, they will be set up to thank you, thank you and thank you some more for your contribution. Perks will include original handmade jewelry, original paintings by myself or my amazing staff. Each piece of art created is unique and beautiful!!
If we do not meet our goal and get partially funded, the money will go to pay my staff, refunds, rent, studio bills, in that order...

<p>Girls Rock Dallas is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering girls through music education in Dallas, Texas. GRD provides a day camp to girls, ages 8-17. Qualified volunteers will instruct campers in guitar, bass, drums and vocals. The campers will form bands and learn how to write original songs together to perform at the camp’s showcase.  The girls will also attend life-skill workshops. GRD differs from other music instruction classes by providing a safe, all-female oriented environment for the girls to interact and be themselves, thereby cultivating higher self-esteem and confidence.</p>
<p>Girls Rock Dallas is raising funds for our inaugural camp this summer, the week of July 23-27 at Life in Deep Ellum near downtown Dallas.</p>
<h3>
<strong>The Impact</strong><strong></strong>
</h3>
<p>Our program is designed to include girls who are unable to attend our camp because of financial reasons.  Money raised is vital to ensure that these girls have the opportunity to attend camp if it is something that they choose to do.</p>
<p>GRD provides full and partial scholarships on a need basis to allow girls who may not otherwise have the chance to participate in our camp. GRD believes that all girls, regardless of economic or social status, should have the opportunity to attend our camp.  We feel that our program creates a unique opportunity for girls in the Dallas area.  By providing a positive and creative community for the girls, they will be less tempted to engage in unbecoming activities.</p>
<h3> <strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong>
</h3>
<p>In order to teach these girls how to rock, we need the necessary equipment for rocking: </p>
<ul>
<li>music equipment: guitars, bass guitars, amps, PAs, mics, drums, cables, cords, gutiar strings, drum sticks, ear plugs, etc.</li>
<li>materials and supplies for our life-skill workshops</li>
<li>promotional materials</li>
<li>scholarships for campers who can't afford the full camp tuition</li>
<li>camp t-shirts</li>
<li>programs of our showcase</li>
</ul><p>For your contribution to make our camp a rockin camp we have set out some pretty awesome rewards for you guys! Picks, t-shirts, hoodies, signed posters, signed guitars, and CDs of the girls’ original songs and more! Check out the perks section on the right for specific details.  Donations are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<ul>
<li>As a project based school, we strive to bring real life examples across multiple subjects to aide in a constructive learning environment.</li>

<li>Countless cross subject matter projects will engage students to work in teams to demonstrate knowledge of the sharks, such as testing tank PH levels or demonstrating marine life’s role in local literature.</li>
<li>In addition to learning to care for and monitoring the well being of the sharks, this project will become a springboard for studying the marine animals found in the Gulf of Mexico.

<p>My dream is to empower the youth by encouraging true bravery through the understanding of the self and subsequent realization of children’s own unique potential. My goal is to integrate self-development and dignity courses into our educational system, establishing critical life skills and techniques for children to acknowledge themselves and their peers as worthy individuals.</p>
<p>There seems to be an underlying but recurrent belief in our society of human inadequacy, whether it not being eligible for a university degree, taking a leadership position or simply being a good enough mother. This belief is cemented in children’s education very early on and leads to anxiety, stress and fear, as they get older. Thus, I think it is fundamental to make a positive impact in the world, starting with people in a young age to create a stronger change in the future and it is to accomplish this purpose that I gratefully receive donations.</p>

<h3>The beginning and the end of this video are a little silly, and the middle is informative and important! Something for everyone!</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello friends, family, and indiegogo browsers!</p>
<p>I'm fundraising for a volunteer trip to the Timoun Kiskeya orphanage in Haiti, run by my dear friend, Amanda Keating.</p>
<p>In the past she and I have worked to fundraise for Hurricane Katrina Victims, and to raise awareness and end the genocide in Sudan. (Read about it here! <a href=""http://oldsite.the-signal.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=50059&amp;format=print"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://oldsite.the-signal.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=50059&amp;format=print</a>)</p>
<p>We are currently working on creating a program for me to work on with the kids for one week in September. </p>
<p>It's very important to me that I take time to do this this year. Your help will give me the opportunity to provide necessary assistance and specialized educational skills to Timoun Kiskeya.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Updates on the specifics of the budget are coming soon but for now:</p>
<p>About $300 will go towards supplementing my travel expenses.</p>
<p>The rest will go to the program itself and anything leftover from that will go to Timoun Kiskeya's running costs</p>
<p>Perks will include postcards, handmade art, poems, and personalized videos. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Though the news about Haiti is not currently at the forefront, it is still a country very much in need, and no one there more so than the children. </p>
<p>Timoun Kiskeya protects children from slavery and harm while also providing them with inspiration and tools to build better futures for themselves and their country. </p>
<p>I believe my experience and joy working with young children combined with my passions for sustainability, education, and community are worth sharing there. </p>

We are currently working on creating a program for me to work on with the kids for one week in September. 
It's very important to me that I take time to do this this year. Your help will give me the opportunity to provide necessary assistance and specialized educational skills to Timoun Kiskeya.


What We Need & What You Get
Updates on the specifics of the budget are coming soon but for now:
About $300 will go towards supplementing my travel expenses.
The rest will go to the program itself and anything leftover from that will go to Timoun Kiskeya's running costs
Perks will include postcards, handmade art, poems, and personalized videos. 


The Impact
Though the news about Haiti is not currently at the forefront, it is still a country very much in need, and no one there more so than the children. 
Timoun Kiskeya protects children from slavery and harm while also providing them with inspiration and tools to build better futures for themselves and their country. 
I believe my experience and joy working with young children combined with my passions for sustainability, education, and community are worth sharing there.

</h3>
<p>Many of you know that I discovered <a href=""http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Waldorf Education</a> when Enid was 3 years old. From then on, it became my mission to get her into a Waldorf school and explore becoming a Waldorf Handwork Teacher myself.

<p>This year I was accepted into the <a href=""http://www.fibercraftstudio.org/applied_arts_program/eighth_cycle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">8th Cycle</a> of the Applied Arts Program at the <a href=""http://www.fibercraftstudio.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fiber Craft Studio</a>, which is located at the Threefold Educational Center in Chestnut Ridge, NY. The problem is the tuition isn't cheap and like with most folks, I don't have unlimited funds. My $200 scholarship grant doesn't stretch far into the more than $3000 of tuition each year... and that's not including dorm fees, travel, and food! </p>
<p>I have scrimped and managed to save enough to start my training, but now
 I'm asking for your help. I will not fully be able to share the 
magnitude of thanks I'd like to give for those that help me along the 
way. <br/></p>
<p>On top of that, I've been working as Handwork Assistant at <a href=""http://www.emersonwaldorf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Enid's school</a>, which is measly hours/pay. As sad as I make it sound, it's an opportunity I couldn't let pass by.<br/></p>

</h3>
<ul><li>During this first phase, I'm hoping to work towards the goal of <i>only</i> $650, but don't let that dampen your donation.  If I reach my goal or go beyond it, I only lose 4%. If not, the man brings me down by 9%.<br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>I believe that handwork is beneficial and too often
forgotten in today’s society, especially in regards to children. People have forgotten how to use their hands to create useful objects, and I'd like to be part of shepherding a new generation through handwork. (no yarn pun intended) <br/></p>
<p>Handwork helps balance the
intellectual and movement activities of children. Students experience the ups and downs of creating things on their own. Handwork strengthens concentration, dexterity, and hand-eye coordination, plus it enhances math skills through
 counting and measuring. And of course, it offers a boost in self-confidence that will carry them through in life.<br/></p>

<h3><b>Short
Summary</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am Dr. Justine Marie Shuey. I am a Board Certified Sexologist and AASECT Certified Sexuality Educator with a Doctorate in Human Sexuality and a Masters in Human Sexuality Education. For years I have been helping individuals of all ages expand their knowledge around sexuality and gain confidence in their sexual expression. I present on hundreds of college campuses, medical schools, hospitals, organizations and conferences all over the United States and Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I want to teach the world about healthy sexuality! Every day college students from all over the United States and Canada reach out to me to schedule sexuality education presentations on their campuses. Unfortunately, most schools are slashing budgets and many student organizations lack the funding to cover the expenses of bringing sex education programming to their campus. The goal of this campaign is to raise funding to help reduce the actual expenses (travel and supplies) of events to make sex education more accessible to college students. </span></p>
<h3><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We need funding to make more events possible. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Every dollar gets us one step closer to providing Sex Education programs on college campuses. The funding will be used to cover the actual expenses (travel and supplies) to make more events possible. While the funding goal for this campaign is set to $500, anything above and beyond that goal will be put towards additional events. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;"">If you donate $15 or more (plus the cost of shipping) you will receive a #1 Tip for Hotter Sex T-Shirt. </span></li>

<h3><b>Sex Education Program</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">College is a time to experiment with academic interests, career choices, and sexual expression. Sexuality is still considered a taboo subject, leaving unanswered questions and perpetuating misconceptions. Dr. Justine Marie Shuey, a highly acclaimed, certified sexuality educator and keynote speaker addresses misinformation head-on while enhancing sexual awareness. Colleges and universities testify that Dr. Shuey encourages students to explore and learn about sexuality in an entertaining, engaging, and informative way.</span></p>

Summary
I am Dr. Justine Marie Shuey. I am a Board Certified Sexologist and AASECT Certified Sexuality Educator with a Doctorate in Human Sexuality and a Masters in Human Sexuality Education. For years I have been helping individuals of all ages expand their knowledge around sexuality and gain confidence in their sexual expression. I present on hundreds of college campuses, medical schools, hospitals, organizations and conferences all over the United States and Canada. 
I want to teach the world about healthy sexuality! Every day college students from all over the United States and Canada reach out to me to schedule sexuality education presentations on their campuses. Unfortunately, most schools are slashing budgets and many student organizations lack the funding to cover the expenses of bringing sex education programming to their campus. The goal of this campaign is to raise funding to help reduce the actual expenses (travel and supplies) of events to make sex education more accessible to college students. 
What
We Need & What You Get
We need funding to make more events possible. Every dollar gets us one step closer to providing Sex Education programs on college campuses. The funding will be used to cover the actual expenses (travel and supplies) to make more events possible. While the funding goal for this campaign is set to $500, anything above and beyond that goal will be put towards additional events. 

If you donate $15 or more (plus the cost of shipping) you will receive a #1 Tip for Hotter Sex T-Shirt. 
If you donate $25 or more I will give you a personal shout out on social media.
If you donate $25 or more (plus the cost of shipping) you will receive a 100% premium silicone waterproof vibrator in your choice of 4 styles. 
If you donate $69 or more you will receive a a special gift bag with tips for great oral sex, safer sex supplies and flavored lubricant for your oral pleasures. 

If you donate $100 or more you will help cover the cost of a hotel room and I will send you a bag of swag filled with sexy samples and a handwritten thank you note and give you a personal shout out on social media.


If you donate $250 or more you will help cover the cost of a flight and you will have the opportunity to schedule a personal one-on-one educational session with me via skype or phone, I will send you a bag of swag filled with sexy items and a handwritten thank you note and give you a personal shout out on social media.



We also give away condoms, lubricants, and other safer sex supplies at every event and raffle off awesome prizes to attendees. If your business would like to donate products or services to be given to students at events please contact info@drshuey.com to discuss these opportunities.

</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is
Beth and I have been a primary teacher in San Francisco, California for the
past five years. I first visited Cambodia one year ago on holiday and it was
love at first sight. Not only is the country strikingly beautiful, but so are
the people.  I was amazed at the warmth, friendliness, and contagious
smiles that greeted me here.  I wondered
how a country that has endured horrors such as genocide could be what seemed
like the happiest place on earth.  The
Cambodian people are a testament to the courage, beauty, and resilience of the
human spirit. Even though I was only able to stay in Cambodia a few days, I
knew I would be back and I knew I wanted to help. </p>
<p>Education
has taken a major hit in Cambodia since 1975-1979 when all intellectuals and
educators were killed during the Pol Pot regime. Almost a third of the
population were executed during the era of the Khmer Rouge.  People killed their own people.  Pol Pot thought an agrarian society was
utopian.  He held the famers in highest
esteem and thought anyone that had too much money was poisoning the
system.  He relocated millions of
Cambodians from the city centers to the countryside, turning major population
centers into ghost towns. The people were tortured and sent to killing fields or
placed in prisons, including children and women.  Impossible production demands were placed on
people in forced labor camps and people were given little to no food.  Maybe only a few grains of rice per day.  I met a man who said he doesn’t even know his
mother’s name. He was taken from her as a small boy and she was killed in the
camp.  Many adults who grew up during
this time were never given any type of education and some are illiterate in
their home language of Khmer.  The
country is in the beginning stages of trying to rebuild and recover from this
dark era.  Many leaders of the regime
have yet to be prosecuted.  Saws and
hammers are literally heard all day long from the early dawn hours as people
reconstruct their identities and their communities.</p>
<p> Children sell to help their families, some who
live on just pennies per day.  A good wage in Cambodia is about one hundred American dollars per
month, but this is rare. Therefore all family members need to pitch in to help
support the family, many of which are very large.  The first time I was here, a small child of
about five came to me as I walked through pub street telling me he needed money
for formula for his baby brother (a common story). Not taking, “No” for an
answer, he latched himself onto my leg and continued to walk around on my leg
for at least twenty minutes.  As much as
my heart ached to help the children, I knew that giving handouts to them and
purchasing their items was not the way to truly help.  Instead, these practices are actually counterproductive.
 If children are able to make a good living begging and selling their
items in the street, they will see no need to go to school and this will only
continue their reliance on the tourists and perpetuate the cycle of poverty. </p>
<p>Sexual
slavery of children is another grim reality in Cambodia.  A friend of mine was working for Childsafe,
helping to break up the rings of child prostitution, risking his own life to do
so.  He helped save a boy of eight and
found a girl of age four placed in a bag, her life taken.  Providing a good education will open up
worlds of opportunities for people that may feel they have no other way to
survive.</p>
<p>Who are we?</p>
<p>Painting
Smiles is a small organization of individuals committed to improving the level
of education in rural Cambodia, specifically in the area of Otres Village,
outside of Sihanoukville on the southwestern coast of Cambodia.  Painting
Smiles was started by Shaun Prest in 2011.  Shaun first traveled to
Cambodia 7 years ago with a friend on motorbikes, delivering coloring books and felt pens to
children in rural areas and it is from here that the name of the school,
""Painting Smiles"" originated.  The school's mission is to
provide quality free English instruction to over 250 students, grades K-5.
 A new initiative we are organizing is a mobile classroom that
will visit rural areas of Cambodia that do not have any access to education.
Instead, we will bring the education to them!</p>
<p>Your
contributions to the Painting Smiles school will have a direct and measurable
impact on the families in Cambodia.  Your
donations will extend the reach of our school to families with no access to
English education.  Your contributions
will enable us to take resources to those in need, improving their future opportunities. </p>
<p>At the Painting Smiles site, we have stacks of
notebooks from “lost children” who come to school a few times, then are sucked into employment. With engaging resources, a Khmer outreach worker and extra-curricular activities, we hope to offer them something that enhances their life experience. </p>
<p>Cost</p>
<p>We are
currently operating on less than $120 per month (a recent income from local businesses) which is only enough to cover the cost of a Khmer teacher and translator salary. The Western teachers are unpaid and
volunteer-only, paying their own costs. 
We are seeking funds for the following resources:</p>
<p>- truck for a MOBILE CLASSROOM to reach the people in rural Sihanoukville who do not have access to English education</p>
<p>- fuel for the mobile classroom</p>
<p>-whiteboard for the mobile classroom</p>

My name is
Beth and I have been a primary teacher in San Francisco, California for the
past five years. I first visited Cambodia one year ago on holiday and it was
love at first sight. Not only is the country strikingly beautiful, but so are
the people.  I was amazed at the warmth, friendliness, and contagious
smiles that greeted me here.  I wondered
how a country that has endured horrors such as genocide could be what seemed
like the happiest place on earth.  The
Cambodian people are a testament to the courage, beauty, and resilience of the
human spirit. Even though I was only able to stay in Cambodia a few days, I
knew I would be back and I knew I wanted to help. 
Education
has taken a major hit in Cambodia since 1975-1979 when all intellectuals and
educators were killed during the Pol Pot regime. Almost a third of the
population were executed during the era of the Khmer Rouge.  People killed their own people.  Pol Pot thought an agrarian society was
utopian.  He held the famers in highest
esteem and thought anyone that had too much money was poisoning the
system.  He relocated millions of
Cambodians from the city centers to the countryside, turning major population
centers into ghost towns. The people were tortured and sent to killing fields or
placed in prisons, including children and women.  Impossible production demands were placed on
people in forced labor camps and people were given little to no food.  Maybe only a few grains of rice per day.  I met a man who said he doesn’t even know his
mother’s name. He was taken from her as a small boy and she was killed in the
camp.  Many adults who grew up during
this time were never given any type of education and some are illiterate in
their home language of Khmer.  The
country is in the beginning stages of trying to rebuild and recover from this
dark era.  Many leaders of the regime
have yet to be prosecuted.  Saws and
hammers are literally heard all day long from the early dawn hours as people
reconstruct their identities and their communities.
 Children sell to help their families, some who
live on just pennies per day.  A good wage in Cambodia is about one hundred American dollars per
month, but this is rare. Therefore all family members need to pitch in to help
support the family, many of which are very large.  The first time I was here, a small child of
about five came to me as I walked through pub street telling me he needed money
for formula for his baby brother (a common story). Not taking, “No” for an
answer, he latched himself onto my leg and continued to walk around on my leg
for at least twenty minutes.  As much as
my heart ached to help the children, I knew that giving handouts to them and
purchasing their items was not the way to truly help.  Instead, these practices are actually counterproductive.
 If children are able to make a good living begging and selling their
items in the street, they will see no need to go to school and this will only
continue their reliance on the tourists and perpetuate the cycle of poverty. 
Sexual
slavery of children is another grim reality in Cambodia.  A friend of mine was working for Childsafe,
helping to break up the rings of child prostitution, risking his own life to do
so.  He helped save a boy of eight and
found a girl of age four placed in a bag, her life taken.  Providing a good education will open up
worlds of opportunities for people that may feel they have no other way to
survive.
Who are we?
Painting
Smiles is a small organization of individuals committed to improving the level
of education in rural Cambodia, specifically in the area of Otres Village,
outside of Sihanoukville on the southwestern coast of Cambodia.  Painting
Smiles was started by Shaun Prest in 2011.  Shaun first traveled to
Cambodia 7 years ago with a friend on motorbikes, delivering coloring books and felt pens to
children in rural areas and it is from here that the name of the school,
""Painting Smiles"" originated.  The school's mission is to
provide quality free English instruction to over 250 students, grades K-5.
 A new initiative we are organizing is a mobile classroom that
will visit rural areas of Cambodia that do not have any access to education.
Instead, we will bring the education to them!
Your
contributions to the Painting Smiles school will have a direct and measurable
impact on the families in Cambodia.  Your
donations will extend the reach of our school to families with no access to
English education.  Your contributions
will enable us to take resources to those in need, improving their future opportunities. 
At the Painting Smiles site, we have stacks of
notebooks from “lost children” who come to school a few times, then are sucked into employment. With engaging resources, a Khmer outreach worker and extra-curricular activities, we hope to offer them something that enhances their life experience. 
Cost
We are
currently operating on less than $120 per month (a recent income from local businesses) which is only enough to cover the cost of a Khmer teacher and translator salary. The Western teachers are unpaid and
volunteer-only, paying their own costs. 
We are seeking funds for the following resources:
- truck for a MOBILE CLASSROOM to reach the people in rural Sihanoukville who do not have access to English education
- fuel for the mobile classroom
-whiteboard for the mobile classroom
- clipboards for the mobile classroom

Also I cannot do any form of part-time job here to help me support myself and continue my studies. Many of the other affected international students whose countries are not far from Taiwan, especially those from Thailand have started going back home because they cannot sustain it. The living cost is so expensive in Taiwan. I believe I have come too far to go back to nothing or start from scratch   ; even if I should go back home I cannot afford the flight ticket. I believe with little help , I can continue on my studies so as to keep working on my dream of contributing to the improvement of food security in my country as well as help myself and family. I also want to be a poet whose writings may help change some negative concepts mentality that is causes most of our problems  such as the irony of “ The more children, the more fortunate”.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Pixelles is entirely volunteer-based and organized in our free time outside of our day jobs. However, while we try to keep costs down to a minimum, our programs do require some money to function. Your donation will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>TWO Pixelles Game Incubators (2015 &amp; 2016)</b><br/><i></i>Our incubator program is a free, 6 week workshop where at 10+ women of diverse backgrounds and experiences make their first video game. No previous experience or programming knowledge required!  At the end, we have a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/426056347551037/?ref=4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">community showcase</a> to celebrate our newest makers. Many of our alumna have gone on to making more games, leading game jams, and even joining the games industry!  (<i>Note: Games made during our incubator belong 100% to the participants. We don't make any money nor ask for anything in return.</i>)<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1273977/files/20150306103828-igg-pgi3.png?1425667108"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Non-profit registration fees with the Quebec government</b><br/>
	In order to be a government listed as a non-profit organization we'll have to register with Quebec and pay fees to them. Having NPO status will allow us to file for grants, obtain sponsorship with companies in Montreal, and ensure Pixelles' future beyond its  founders.	<br/><br/>
</li>
<li> <b>Taxes, fees and perk costs</b><br/>
	This includes Indiegogo campaign related costs such as printing, shipping/mailing, perks, &amp; fees.<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p>Any extra funds will cover more workshops, programs, equipment &amp; tools licenses! We're also looking into buying old laptops to make our activities more accessible since not everyone has or can afford one. We'd love to also be able to pay our workshop leaders &amp; helpers a small honorarium for their time. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, as much money as possible will go into paying for at least one run of Pixelles Game Incubator.<b> This program is one of our most important and successful ways we empower women in Montreal to make games.</b></p>

<p>Impact is always hard to quantify, but we believe that our projects have a rippling effect in the community. It’s capable of literally changing the culture and conversation around games, from Montreal outwards.</p>

<p>It’s about more than women making game prototypes. The Pixelles Game Incubator is about each participant creating a game of her very own design, literally empowering her to express herself in a form that she's never before experienced, from the seed of an idea to a real piece of software, even if she's never programmed anything before.</p>
<p>The common perception of game creation as a male-dominated activity is thereby challenged by her existence, game-making journey, and experiences. Our showcase and participation in various cultural organizations/activities in Montreal, in turn, raises awareness in the community about women-in-games &amp; the accessibility of becoming a maker.</p>
<p>Further, many participants find that their passion for game development is sparked by this creative success, and go on to make many more games:</p>

<b>↑ One year later, we asked the women from the first Pixelles Game Incubator what they’ve been up to in games.</b> Since making their first game with us, they've gone on to creating even more games, participating in jams &amp; competitions, working professionally, and becoming more involved in the games community. </div><div>Plus, check out what our 2nd incubator alumna have done, in only one year (hint: it's even more!):</div><div>

<br/>
<p><br/>Our mentorship program connects aspiring and junior women in game dev experienced folks in their dream jobs. It's more than just a role model — we foster help personal relationships that which clear the haze around joining the industry, support their job search, and contribute towards breaking the glass ceiling. So far, we've helped quite a few women get jobs in both AAA and indie studios, with many more on their way!</p>

<br/><p>Our workshops, socials, and jams all bring us together in our shared love of game creation. We've seen our activities grow larger as empowered members, in turn, inspire and teach new ones. </p>
<p>We look forward to the day when these initiatives aren't need in order for everyone or anyone to make games. With your help, we can help empower more women to create, learn, &amp; become a part of the games community, as well as, work towards changing the culture surrounding games.</p>

Pixelles is a non-profit initiative committed to helping more women make and change games. We're based in Montreal, and have already succeeded in building a supportive community of game creators, both hobbyist and professional. Based out of Montreal, our activities are roughly divided into two categories:
Games as artistic medium: Through our annual incubator, game jams, and monthly workshops, we help women realize their own potential at making whatever game they can dream of. As an art form, games benefit from having more diverse voices contributing to its growth. 
Games as career:Through our 1:1 mentorship program and socials, we help women network to gain role models and career advice. Our monthly workshops encourage them to learn new game development skills such as programming languages, 3d modelling, game design, and much more...




Learn more about our methods, incubator, results, and how to start your own women-in-games initiatives by watching Tanya's talk at the Game Developer's Conference and reading our post-mortem of the Pixelles Game Incubator (2013).


Pixelles is entirely volunteer-based and organized in our free time outside of our day jobs. However, while we try to keep costs down to a minimum, our programs do require some money to function. Your donation will go to:


TWO Pixelles Game Incubators (2015 & 2016)Our incubator program is a free, 6 week workshop where at 10+ women of diverse backgrounds and experiences make their first video game. No previous experience or programming knowledge required!  At the end, we have a community showcase to celebrate our newest makers. Many of our alumna have gone on to making more games, leading game jams, and even joining the games industry!  (Note: Games made during our incubator belong 100% to the participants. We don't make any money nor ask for anything in return.)



Non-profit registration fees with the Quebec government
	In order to be a government listed as a non-profit organization we'll have to register with Quebec and pay fees to them. Having NPO status will allow us to file for grants, obtain sponsorship with companies in Montreal, and ensure Pixelles' future beyond its  founders.	

 Taxes, fees and perk costs
	This includes Indiegogo campaign related costs such as printing, shipping/mailing, perks, & fees.




Any extra funds will cover more workshops, programs, equipment & tools licenses! We're also looking into buying old laptops to make our activities more accessible since not everyone has or can afford one. We'd love to also be able to pay our workshop leaders & helpers a small honorarium for their time. 
If we don't reach our goal, as much money as possible will go into paying for at least one run of Pixelles Game Incubator. This program is one of our most important and successful ways we empower women in Montreal to make games.


Impact is always hard to quantify, but we believe that our projects have a rippling effect in the community. It’s capable of literally changing the culture and conversation around games, from Montreal outwards.


It’s about more than women making game prototypes. The Pixelles Game Incubator is about each participant creating a game of her very own design, literally empowering her to express herself in a form that she's never before experienced, from the seed of an idea to a real piece of software, even if she's never programmed anything before.
The common perception of game creation as a male-dominated activity is thereby challenged by her existence, game-making journey, and experiences. Our showcase and participation in various cultural organizations/activities in Montreal, in turn, raises awareness in the community about women-in-games & the accessibility of becoming a maker.
Further, many participants find that their passion for game development is sparked by this creative success, and go on to make many more games:



↑ One year later, we asked the women from the first Pixelles Game Incubator what they’ve been up to in games. Since making their first game with us, they've gone on to creating even more games, participating in jams & competitions, working professionally, and becoming more involved in the games community. Plus, check out what our 2nd incubator alumna have done, in only one year (hint: it's even more!):


Our mentorship program connects aspiring and junior women in game dev experienced folks in their dream jobs. It's more than just a role model — we foster help personal relationships that which clear the haze around joining the industry, support their job search, and contribute towards breaking the glass ceiling. So far, we've helped quite a few women get jobs in both AAA and indie studios, with many more on their way!



Our workshops, socials, and jams all bring us together in our shared love of game creation. We've seen our activities grow larger as empowered members, in turn, inspire and teach new ones. 
We look forward to the day when these initiatives aren't need in order for everyone or anyone to make games. With your help, we can help empower more women to create, learn, & become a part of the games community, as well as, work towards changing the culture surrounding games.



It started with the Pixelles Game Incubator I, in January 2013. From there, Pixelles has grown to host monthly workshops, jams, socials, & 1:1 mentoring for women who want to join the games industry.
Rebecca Cohen-Palacios, Director & Co-FounderShe made her first teach-typing, cat game in the Hand Eye Society's ""Difference Engine Initiative 2"" (similar to Pixelles' incubator). That experience led her to make many more games and go on to working at Ubisoft as a UI artist & developer.
Tanya X. Short, Director & Co-FounderShe has worked as a professional game designer for many years. She is now Creative Director of her own indie studio, Kitfox Games, and speaks about procedural generation design to anyone who will listen.

The Pixelles Game Incubator III is currently in-progress and is coordinated, for the first time, by alumna of past incubators (2013/2014):





Kim Hoang
Love Love Hill Collective comics artist & alt games maker



Alicia Fortier
Game Designer at Ubisoft & veteran jammer






Pixelles is made by possible by our many allies, partners, friends, family,  developers, mentors, workshop volunteers, participants, and aspiring women-in-games. Give a high-five to our amazing mentors and join our Facebook group. Many of our activities, around the community events, and knowledge-sharing takes place there.





Anyone can help; no matter your gender, orientation, or age. If you'd like to do any of the things below please e-mail us at info@pixelles.ca! Thank you!


Become an industry mentor
	Are you experienced in the industry or as an indie developer? Volunteer your time by becoming an individual mentor and help guide a future woman in games. You can even do this long-distance! 	


Donate a laptop
	Not everyone can afford to have a laptop for our workshop, game jams, or other activities. By donating equipment, you're helping make our programs more accessible! Have equipment to donate? Send an email to info@pixelles.ca.


In Montreal: Give a workshop
	Every month, we organize a free workshop for the community; open to everyone of all ages, gender, and skill level. You can teach a small group how to code, draw, 3D model, Twine, pixel art, anything really! In the past, we've done weird Unity/SketchUp, dating sims, 3D modelling, Twine, & Unity programming.
	


In Montreal: Help out at a workshop
	It's only natural for people to get stuck or lost at a workshop. For this we have helpers who go around and make sure things run smoothly while the teacher is teaching. You'll answer questions, orient folks in the right direction, & provide encouragement. 




Since 2013, we've partnered with, organized activities, & been supported by a number of organizations around Montreal. We're looking forward to working with lots more in the future!

</p><p><b>WE NEED <u>YOUR</u>
GENEROUS SUPPORT TO INTRODUCE THIS VALUABLE PRODUCT TO THE WORLD…. MORE SUCCESSFUL FUNDRAISING…LESS WORK!  YOU CAN HELP SOLVE A
HUGE PROBLEM.</b></p>
<p>97% of all schools and service groups must fundraise to
support themselves and their projects.</p>
<p>Traditional School Fundraising as it is usually done today
is an outdated and, often times, dangerous model. We at His Coffee Company have
developed a far better way to reach and exceed fundraising goals with our new ONLINE e-commerce program,
which is better described as “an on-going Revenue Stream”. More money raised….less
work!</p>
<p>His Coffee Company has pioneered a software program that
allows us to correct all that is not good about traditional fundraising. We
looked at all the common problems associated with traditional fundraising and
we addressed them individually, using today’s technology and today’s trends in
societal behavior. Please consider the dramatic impact of the following points as
we take each challenging aspect of fundraising and present our solution.</p>
<p><i>Traditional
Fundraising usually lasts about two weeks from start to finish (not counting weeks
of confusing preparation and follow-up).</i></p>
<p><b>His Coffee Co.’s online fundraising, on-going revenue stream, does not require an end date; it does not
need one because coffee and tea are a daily commodity, not an ""extra"" in the
lives of most people. Unlike wrapping paper, popcorn, or cookie dough etc.,
people are willing to purchase and repurchase the coffee and tea they
drink daily, while supporting the group or loved ones with which they are personally
connected. We have developed an online order and reorder system to capture and
track all purchases and profits back to the original fundraising organization or individual. Monthly
orders, all school year long will far out perform a two week push for the usual
fundraising “stuff”.</b></p>
<p><i>Traditional
fundraising has always required a dedicated organizer or team of organizers to
get all the order-taking materials from the vendor to the participants and
explain to everyone involved how that program should work….always confusing! When the order taking stops after one or
two weeks, the organizer must gather all the forms from the participants, tally
them up manually, deposit the checks (hope they don’t bounce) and cash into a
special bank account, order and pay for the product from the vendor in advance,
wait 4-6 weeks usually, and then receive the bulk order. They must then
separate that bulk shipment into the original small orders per participant
based on those hand written order forms, re-contact each participant and make
sure that each perfectly prepared order is delivered to each participant, who
in turn, delivers their orders to those who gave them the original order. Even
if all this goes smoothly, the organizers are usually
heard saying.. ”Never again”!  This is how
traditional school fundraising has been done for over 75 years……<b>it’s time for a change and we have developed
the new system!</b></i></p>
<p><b>His Coffee Co. has created
a program which is run completely online which facilitates an ongoing revenue production that ELIMINATES
the massive work and confusion of the Organizer or team.  NO
MORE ordering and distributing paper order forms. NO compiling or deciphering of
completed order forms. NO processing personal checks or cash. NO bulk orders
from the vendor to sort through. NO personal deliveries by organizer or
participants. Now the online order is sent directly to the customer or purchasing
supporter in 4-6 <i>days</i>, not the currently accepted 4-6 <i>weeks</i>.  Every person who
participates in this new system of revenue production has their own
semi-customizable online landing page which automatically links them to the
group they are associated with. For example: in a typical school setting, a
student and their parents can send an email to all his or her friends and family asking them to support their
cause by clicking on their unique landing page which takes the supporter
directly to their store.  The invited supporter makes their purchases via their approved and secure credit
card. That order will be tracked in our
system back to the student/individual/family that sent the email invitation,
also tracked back to the class in which they are a member, along to the
school that they attend, and even to the His Coffee Independent Sales Representative
who may have introduced the on-going revenue program to that school. The school
will receive about 35% profit on each online sale. </b><b>Reorders are also tracked the same way.
Reminders and promotions can be sent out to all supporters as often as needed by
His Coffee Company. The school or the supporter can also check the auto-reorder
option on their original order to reorder. The ONGOING REVENUE STREAM profits
are paid to the school on the 10<sup>th</sup>
of the following month for all the sales shipped in the preceding month. </b></p>
<p><b>THIS IS WHY WE NEED
YOU…</b></p>
<p><b>The software program described above is no longer a dream. We have
spent the entire year of 2013 and invested over $100,000.00 developing this unique fundraising tool into reality. The potential to change the way
schools, groups, and even individual’s raise funds is ready to be presented to
the world. We need your help to do that! As with any software dream, in the process of bringing this program to fruition, we've exceeded our budget in order to include as many aspects as necessary to achieve successful fundraising results. In doing so, we've had to invest money into its development which was assigned to the promotion of this incredible tool.  We want to bring this project to the next level. We want to get it out there to help schools, churches, youth groups raise the money they need. The more you generously invest in this
pioneering product, the more lives we can touch. Please know you are needed.</b></p>

<p>Of all the amazing experiences I got to have on this

on these children’s faces and their eagerness to learn, only about half of them
could participate in their classroom exercises, as they didn’t own a pencil.

to donate to join me in helping the children of Dekpor Village. One dollar to
them can go such a long way, and one dollar in our society can’t get us much

<br/></div>","* All proceeds will be going directly to the Dekpor OrganizationDuring fall of 2012, I took part in a study abroad program called Semester at Sea. In 107 days, we sailed
around the perimeter of the Atlantic Ocean, visiting 14 different countries on 4
continents, North America, Europe, Africa and South America. 
Of all the amazing experiences I got to have on this
journey, the single memory that stuck with me most was my visit to Dekpor Village,
Ghana. 
As a part of my stay in the village, I got to volunteer as a
teacher in the school for a classroom containing Kindergarden-2nd
grade students.  Despite the huge smiles
on these children’s faces and their eagerness to learn, only about half of them
could participate in their classroom exercises, as they didn’t own a pencil.
Seeing this unfair limitation to education broke my heart. Yet sadly, this was
far from the only limitation that faces the children in Dekpor. 
It has now been over two years since I visited the amazing
village of Dekpor, but I continue to think about these people every day. So, for the last two years, I have been trying to help these
kids in my own small way by asking my family to donate to the Dekpor School Development Organization for my birthday. This year, I am taking it a step further. Instead
of birthday presents, birthday cards or Facebook comments, I’d like to invite everyone
to donate to join me in helping the children of Dekpor Village. One dollar to
them can go such a long way, and one dollar in our society can’t get us much
more than a cup of coffee. I've decided to focus this campaign on the need for both ...health and education of these children, as health is an integral part of being able to learn. There are many important projects that are being done, and you can be a part of making a difference in the life of someone who truly needs your help.

<p><b>FALLEN
NOT FORGOTTEN</b></p>
<p>Fallen
Not Forgotten, Inc. was founded in October of 2012.  Since that time we
have been able to successfully raise enough funds to establish four small
college scholarships:  Our first was given to Macae, the son of USMC
Sergeant Joseph Wrightsman that was killed in action (KIA) in Afghanistan on 18
July 2010. Our second was established for the three-year-old daughter of
Sergeant Enrique Mondragon (USA) who was KIA on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2012
while conducting dismounted patrols in Baraki Barak, Afghanistan.
 And our third one, established for the now 7-year-old daughter of 1<sup>st</sup>
Lieutenant Jason Mann who died while serving in Afghanistan 17 July 2008 as
part of the 24<sup>th</sup> MEU.  Our most recent one was raised in honor
of Chief Joel Baldwin (USN) for his daughter Cali who will be attending college
next fall.<span>  As we were concluding
fundraising for Cali, Fallen Not Forgotten was informed of the death of a Marine
that the President of Fallen Not Forgotten had previously served with in Iraq
on two occasions.  It is with a heavy
heart that Fallen Not Forgotten would like to do this current round of
fundraising in memory of Gunnery Sergeant (ret) Moncie Johns – a man that has
served his country in every clime and place and a continued supporter of Fallen
Not Forgotten.  At this time, Fallen Not
Forgotten asks for your continued support in celebration of those that have

<p>We

some and “Prospect Hollywood” to others.<span> 
I first met him as Gunnery Sergeant Johns in 2007 when he was serving as
Company Gunnery Sergeant for Kilo Company 3/3 as we prepared to deploy to Iraq.
During my first “field op” with the
company, I made a casual comment regarding trash around packs on the deck.  In a moment of controlled rage as the pigment of his skin turned bright red
while steam shot out of the ears on his now spinning head ...a fury of knife hands
flew about at the cyclical rate - I witnessed all hell cut loose as the Drill
Instructor in Gunny Johns unleashed an unrelenting blast of hate and discontent
until every piece of trash was properly disposed of, packs covered and aligned,
and a company of Marines quickly reminded of the expectations of the unit.  I
later served with Gunny in 2008 when he took over as a platoon commander for
Weapons Company 3/3.  A big
responsibility for the most senior company within the unit – and again he
excelled on a very independent deployment back to Iraq.  Upon return from that deployment Gunny
retired and began his life in the civilian sector.</span></p>
<p>We
have kept in touch throughout the years, with our most recent contact days ago
as we laughed about life and how we were both back over in the same neck of the
woods.<span>  Gunny, now working for a private
security contractor firm for DoS, was taken from us with only four days
remaining in country before he returned home. 
At home awaiting him are his two girls, Haley and Madison.  Haley just graduated high school and is
expected to head off to Saint Cloud State University in the fall, while Madison
remains in high school.  As many of you
who read this know – they have previously lost their mother and now this.  </span></p>

realized just how attainable this goal is if we all were to pitch in.<br/></span></p>

NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF FALLEN NOT FORGOTTEN, INC:</b></p>
<p>I
am an active duty service member that has not forgotten the sacrifices paid by
our service members overseas as well as their families at home.  I, like
many of you, have experienced the loss of many friends throughout the past thirteen
years and know in my heart that these are not “someone else’s kids” …these are
“our” sons and daughters and they deserve our help to ensure they are well
taken care of.  </p>
<p>Fallen Not Forgotten, Inc will distribute the funds directly
to the school that Haley is scheduled to attend for any of the school related expenses
mentioned above.<span>  If she does not need
the funds immediately we will maintain the funds until she does.  She will have access to these funds for
college or a trade school until she reaches the age 25, unless she is serving
in the military or attending graduate school. 
(We will remove the age stipulation and maintain access to the funds as
required if she is participating in any of the above.)  If at the age of 25 she has not utilized all
of the funds and does not fall within one of the categories mentioned above,
the funds will transfer to her younger sister Madison.  If Madison elects to not attend college or a
trade school, at that time, contributors will be given the option to recover
their contribution or provide the funds to another deserving gold star
child.  </span></p>

NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF FALLEN NOT FORGOTTEN, INC:
I
am an active duty service member that has not forgotten the sacrifices paid by
our service members overseas as well as their families at home.  I, like
many of you, have experienced the loss of many friends throughout the past thirteen
years and know in my heart that these are not “someone else’s kids” …these are
“our” sons and daughters and they deserve our help to ensure they are well
taken care of.  
Fallen Not Forgotten, Inc will distribute the funds directly
to the school that Haley is scheduled to attend for any of the school related expenses
mentioned above.  If she does not need
the funds immediately we will maintain the funds until she does.  She will have access to these funds for
college or a trade school until she reaches the age 25, unless she is serving
in the military or attending graduate school. 
(We will remove the age stipulation and maintain access to the funds as
required if she is participating in any of the above.)  If at the age of 25 she has not utilized all
of the funds and does not fall within one of the categories mentioned above,
the funds will transfer to her younger sister Madison.  If Madison elects to not attend college or a
trade school, at that time, contributors will be given the option to recover
their contribution or provide the funds to another deserving gold star
child.  
Thank you for visiting the site and taking the time to
consider contributing!",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

This is very recent: even last summer, she was battling the multiple challenges she'd lived with ever since she was hit by a car at the age of six, catastrophically injuring her brain, her nervous system and inner organs. Headaches, tummy pains, cramps through the night and limping through the day; her coordination was gone, her brain wiped by heavy seizures that left her sick for weeks on end. She was dappy, frightened, lonely and overwhelmed.</p>

My Story

I'm Magdalen's Mum, and my challenges began a little earlier: our story of total loss (thanks to squatters trashing the home we'd just put up for sale when we moved up North) is recounted in a book called ""Rescued by Angels"". I accidentally began a whole new career which began - almost literally -  with single-parenting in the snow! What came out of all this in the end was a radical new healing system (www.metatronic-life.com - do come visit!), but our personal security has yet to be rebuilt.
For the last nearly-two years, Magdalen's step-dad and I - both of us state pensioners -have held her through the final phase of her trauma release: major seizures and other symptoms have needed us on red alert 24/7. What she has eventually achieved has been so huge that it could not happen fast. But it's finally happened: the person who ""left"" at six is fully back and landed.   Magdalen's Gift

Magdalen has pushed back the frontiers in the understanding of trauma: we've witnessed miracles of healing we would never have otherwise discovered, and in time, these will be brought to many others. We have learned that so much that looks irreparable can truly be restored to health and vitality and joy.
So what's our campaign? And why?

What We Need
Magdalen's passion to help others, to take her experience and put it to good use, is one of the main factors that have kept her alive. She has just started a deep-acting, BACP course in counselling, backed up by voluntary work with Mind, the mental health charity, and with Place2Be, the charity that takes counselling into schools. 
This is not only her reward for the astounding job she has done already, but also the first step in a career that will ensure that the wisdom, understanding and knowledge she has grown already, and the skills she will now learn, are creatively harnessed. Everything she has been given in her life, she's given back royally: once she's fully qualified, she will give back - even more widely than before.
These are Magdalen's costs for the two-year period:

The Impact
 Every mother believes in her child. I am coming to this not just as a mother, however, but as someone who has watched in awe as an astoundingly brave soul has faced the deepest devastation and emerged strong, joyful and determined to put every piece of her experience to a creative purpose.   Magdalen is a natural healer: everyone who meets her is drawn to her, and pours out their heart. She is wise way beyond her years, and has been guided all her life by visions and intentions that are global in nature. She will make a difference.

<h3>
</h3>
<p>SayKhmer is a small enterprise providing Khmer language
lessons in Siem Reap Cambodia. Our aim is to teach volunteers, tourists and
long term visitors the basics of the local lingo so that they can
interact with the locals in their native tongue. Our ethos is that learning some basic
Khmer, will go a long way towards understanding the culture and gaining respect
and smiles from the locals.</p>
<p>Since starting the venture we have had the privilege of
teaching people from all corners of the globe and all walks of life in our regular classes held in Siem Reap. The
feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and we thoroughly enjoy
meeting and teaching all the enthusiastic people eager to learn the language.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>SayKhmer Tours<br/>
</h3>
<p>In addition to our regular lessons, we are now working hard
towards launching SayKhmer Tours, whereby we will offer guided tours of the surrounding countryside and lesser visited sites around Siem
Reap, all whilst practicing the language as we go. It’s a unique opportunity to visit local areas and practice the language in real world situations, which
we feel is the best way to learn. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>We need a Tuk Tuk!</h3>
<p>The reason for this crowd-fund campaign is so that we can
raise the necessary funds to buy a SayKhmer TukTuk, to be used on the tours and to provide a regular income for our Khmer teacher.
Having our own TukTuk will allow us to begin our tours for the approaching
high tourist season. <br/></p>
<p>The TukTuk will be driven by our super
friendly native Khmer teacher, who has been with us since the beginning and
without whom SayKhmer would never have been possible. When not being used
for tours, the TukTuk will be available for him to use, providing the
opportunity to make an income and help provide for his family.</p>
<p>To get involved and help us buy the SayKhmer TukTuk, please
select one of the 'Perks' on the crowdfund page. We are aiming to raise between $250 and $500. This will be enough to buy a used TukTuk that we can make our own. If the target is exceeded or there are any surplus funds, it will be used to promote and launch
SayKhmer Tours.</p>
<p>'Perks' for making a contribution include tours, lessons and even your name on the TukTuk itself! <br/></p>
<p>Thank you for your support!<br/></p>

feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and we thoroughly enjoy
meeting and teaching all the enthusiastic people eager to learn the language.

SayKhmer Tours

In addition to our regular lessons, we are now working hard
towards launching SayKhmer Tours, whereby we will offer guided tours of the surrounding countryside and lesser visited sites around Siem
Reap, all whilst practicing the language as we go. It’s a unique opportunity to visit local areas and practice the language in real world situations, which
we feel is the best way to learn. 

We need a Tuk Tuk!
The reason for this crowd-fund campaign is so that we can
raise the necessary funds to buy a SayKhmer TukTuk, to be used on the tours and to provide a regular income for our Khmer teacher.
Having our own TukTuk will allow us to begin our tours for the approaching
high tourist season. 
The TukTuk will be driven by our super
friendly native Khmer teacher, who has been with us since the beginning and
without whom SayKhmer would never have been possible. When not being used
for tours, the TukTuk will be available for him to use, providing the
opportunity to make an income and help provide for his family.
To get involved and help us buy the SayKhmer TukTuk, please
select one of the 'Perks' on the crowdfund page. We are aiming to raise between $250 and $500. This will be enough to buy a used TukTuk that we can make our own. If the target is exceeded or there are any surplus funds, it will be used to promote and launch
SayKhmer Tours.
'Perks' for making a contribution include tours, lessons and even your name on the TukTuk itself! 
Thank you for your support!
Aw’kun!  / Thank you!
