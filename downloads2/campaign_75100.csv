Je me présente Astrid SIMONEAU-PLANES, j'ai 42 ans, je suis mariée et maman de 2 adolescents. J'étais hôtelière restauratrice pendant une dizaine d'année et j'ai aussi eu aussi des commerces.
J'ai mis une photo de moi, afin que vous puissiez voir à qui vous avez à faire et aussi parce que le logo du site internet et de l'association n'est pas encore terminé.
Aujourd'hui je donne mon temps à des associations, dont l'APF (Association des Paralysés de France) et les Restos du coeur. Là, j'ai découvert la double peine que subissaient les personnes ou les familles d'enfant,  handicapés, ou atteints d'un maladie grave, rare et/ou orpheline. En plus des difficultés de santé, ils doivent affronter des difficultés financières.
J'ai donc créé l'Association Pour l'Action Participative, loi 1901, à but non lucratif, qui va gérer un site internet :                            ""www.je-suis-philanthrope.fr"" afin d'aider des personnes ou des familles touchées par un handicap, une maladie grave, rare et/ou orpheline ou la dépendance d'une personne âgée. Association Loi 1901, à but non lucratif, déclarée à la préfecture de Toulon, RNA W832010683. 
Notre devise:                                                                                     On ne peut pas aider tout le monde. Mais tout le monde peut aider quelqu'un.
Les personnes ou les familles pourront y émettre un appel aux dons, en leur nom, afin de les aider à financer un besoin, dû à leur handicap ou leur maladie.
Par exemple, ils pourront faire un appel pour financer:
     - Le reste à charge de l'achat d'un fauteuil roulant électrique (coût environ 20 000 €)
     - Une thérapie ABA, pour les enfants autistes, non remboursée par la sécurité sociale.
     - Une chirurgie à l'étranger, non pratiquée en France, et donc non remboursée.
     - L'aménagement d'une voiture familiale, pour accueillir un fauteuil roulant électrique ( environ 10 000 €, hors prix de la voiture)
     - Une prothèse auditive 
     - ETC.......
 
 
Sur le site, on trouvera aussi:
- Une page Petites annonces, dédiés au handicap et aux malades.
- Une page: Actu des Associations: où elles pourront annoncer l'organisation d'événement, comme un loto pour Eva, Les 10kms de La Londe pour Léo......

Si vous versez plus de 40 €, vous devenez automatiquement adhérent de l'association, pour une année.

I have several years of project management/construction engineering experience with affordable housing, residential and commercial construction.

HELLO HELLO HELLO!
 
We are THE UN-MEANT team, probably the most genuinely creative chaps amongst the 150 teams that will take part in the Mongol Rally in July 2012. Two goals: drive across a third of the world and raise money for 2 different charities that share with us the same human and ethical values:
 Lotus Child a non-profit, non-government organisation working with vulnerable children and families to provide the basic human rights of shelter, food and education. Here it follows a link where you can check yourself al the different activities they are involved with:http://lotuschild.org/  
 REF, Renewable Energy Foundation is a UK registered charity promoting sustainable development for the benefit of the public by means of energy conservation and the use of renewable energy. Link to the website:http://www.ref.org.uk/&nbsp;
 The happy ending of this adventure would see us donating our vehicle to Mongolia’s capital local people thanks the adventurist organization that will take care of the car once reached our destination. Before this can happen, THE UN-MEANT will have to travel for 10,000 miles interacting with local communities in order to increase the understanding of their needs and promote global awareness of their realities through our future creations that will be featured in different platforms on the web.
 
During the 6 weeks journey, we will have to face 3 deserts, 5 mountain peaks across 15 different countries only driven by the noble interest of raising money for international and local charities. Comfort and commodity will be a luxury itself for us throughout the trip.
 
WHO ARE WE BTW?
THE UN-MEANT team is made of:
Mattia an eager photographer and designer from Italy with a 5cm long beard (to be improved), now based in London since 4 years. He is currently studying at London College of Communication and occasionally freelancing. He has recently been selected for several international exhibitions, such as the Barcelona OFFF festival and the International Graphic Art Biennial. During the trip he is planning to create a reportage on different condition affecting poor comunities focusing particularly on lack of clean water.
 Sofie is a young one off Swedish student of fashion design in Florence, modelling in her free time for big firms such as Luisa Via Roma and young photographer like me. She continuously finds pleasure in forcing aventure and unexpectedness in her daily life.
 This trip will also be a chance to combine our passion, skills and true creativity with the main focus on photography and video.
 Find below a link to the previous work that saw us both involved:

2000£/ 2500£= 3000$/3500$ to buy the car

<h3>Who are you people?</h3>
<p>We are FrancoJeunes, a small but aspiring group of dedicated young French-speaking Louisiana professionals who believe in both the future of the French language in Louisiana and the cultural impact of our French-speaking cultures<strong>. </strong>FrancoJeunes seeks to further engage French speakers, especially young professionals, in Louisiana’s francophone community. FrancoJeunes supports and promotes francophone endeavors and French-friendly businesses, encourages bilingual signage and services in both public and private sectors, supports an increase in the visibility of French in all sectors of the community, all to make French an integral part of Louisiana’s cultural economy.</p>

On Friday June 15, 2012<span> a line-item veto was performed by Governor Bobby Jindal that slashed $100,000 from CODOFIL’s budget (approximately 40% of its total budget) for the upcoming year. This budget cut leaves CODOFIL just enough money to pay operating costs with no room for a budget to accomplish its goals, which are</span></span></p>

<li>to oversee the development and expansion of the state's economic development and tourism activities designed to promote our French culture, heritage, and language</li>
<li>to promote, develop, and oversee cultural and educational relations and exchanges within the state and between the state of Louisiana and other countries, provinces, and states that share Louisiana's historical French heritage, culture and language</li>

$1 –Faites partie des 100kLA ! Montrez votre soutien. Vous ne recevrez pa de cadeau, mais vous aurez le doit de fanfaronner !

$25 – Vous recevrez une copie digitale de ‘En Français.’ Le personnel incroyable à Bayou Teche Brewing Company nous a permis de vous donner une copie digitale de ce disque qui est une collection de chansons classiques de rock ‘n roll américain, reprises en français par les meilleurs musiciens au sud de la Louisiane.
$30 – Montrez votre soutien ! Vous recevrez une copie digitale de ‘En Français’ ainsi qu’un patch du drapeau acadien (dessiné par Thomas J. Arceneaux en 1965, patchifié par Bram Johnson en 2012), fait par Parish Ink. Si vous habitez hors des Etats-Unis, merci d’ajouter $3 à votre contribution pour défrayer les coûts d’expédition.
$50 – Montrez votre soutien…encore plus ! Voyez-vous notre logo? Avec les petites personnes en bleu ? Vous aurez ça sur un t-shirt ! Portez-le partout !

This has the potential to eradicate curable STDs (like chlamydia) from entire communities. Plus, don't you want to help make sure your partners tell you if they get diagnosed?</p>

</div>
<div>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Each year there are 9.1 million new STD cases among 15-24 year olds in the United States. Most people with STDs donʼt have any symptoms and donʼt seek testing or treatment. This results in ongoing transmission, particularly among youth and racial/ethnic minorities. Untreated STDs cause serious reproductive health problems over time and they leave those infected vulnerable to other STDs, such as HIV.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img alt=""Disparities"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sexualhealthinnovations.org/images/Disparities.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Disparities""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Traditionally, anonymous partner notification has been provided by health departments. However, most health departments no longer have the funding to provide anonymous partner notification services for STDs other than HIV and syphilis, and even when they do, not everyone wants to tell a government entity who they've had sex with. Still, anonymous partner notification programs have historically coincided with dramatic decreases in STD incidence.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img alt=""Trends"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sexualhealthinnovations.org/images/Trends.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Trends""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Why We Think This Will Work</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So They Can Know has an incredible team behind it, has a ton of support from the public health community, and is likely to work. We asked a random sample of STD clinics if they would tell their patients about it, and over 90% said yes. We asked young Americans if they would use it to notify a partner they weren't willing to tell in person, and over 80% said they'd be likely to. Planned Parenthood, the National Coalition of STD Directors, the Baltimore and New York City health departments, and many other organizations will help us get the word out to clinics that need us.</p>
<p>We've already put in the blood and sweat to build this thing. Now let's get it into the communities that need it and start preventing some STDs.</p>

<p>My name is Remo Moomiaie-Qajar, M.D. and I am the founder and president of the <a href=""http://www.chantalpaydarfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chantal Paydar Foundation</a>, a federally recognized Peace, Justice and Conflict Resolution pubic charity (501c3) in the US. The foundation has supported many bright young people who are doing great deeds to improve their communities and contribute to a better world. Last year on a trip to Africa, I meet two young men, Billian and Jeff, who exemplified the “do good” characteristics the foundation has become so privileged to help. The “Billian Music Family” started three years ago to mentor and to teach life-skills to a handful of disadvantaged yet talented children of the Mathare Slum using music. Through music and dance in a loving and caring family environment, it has blossomed into a community movement fostering the next generation of leaders. Fueled only by the determination of Billian and Jeff, the Billian Music Family has accomplished amazing outreach. Listening and working with Billian and Jeff, I am asking you to join the Chantal Paydar Foundation to address their most urgent need and empower the Billian Music Family to expand the number of young lives they positively influence by funding a community youth art centre in this Indiegogo campaign.</p>

The Billian Music Family was started by Billian Okoth and Jeffery Andre as an experiment 3 years ago to see if the power of music, hip-hop, and dance could elevate the spirits and hopes of the youngest slum residents. The Billian Music Family provides the children of the Mathare Slum the opportunity to explore their lives through music as a means to empower and enable them to grow as community leaders. The experiment was so successful that it grew from 6 children to over 30 in 3 years. The experiment transformed into a movement within the Mathare Slum as a platform for creating a positive change in the community. The “Clean Up the Slum” event removes litter around the slum. “Environmental Love”, where the Billian Music Family plants tree seedlings throughout the slum, motivates others in the community to invest in their community. The Billian Music Family empowers the youth and community of the Mathare slum to believe in and value themselves.  </p>

<p>The Mathare slum is one of the largest slums in the world and houses more than 500,000 people. Although filled with the problems of poverty, the slum is fertile with culture and talent. In 3 years, the founders of the Billian Music Family have proven that with determination and commitment, music and leadership can inspire the children of the Mathare slum. The Billian Music Family has grown beyond its means and needs your help to continue its movement of enlightenment by creating a community centre where children of the slum can learn and expand their musical talents in a peaceful and sheltered environment.</p>

<p>For the first three years, Billian and Jeff have operated the Billian Music Family through the generosity of local store owners who shut down their places of business to offer sanctuary to the Billian Music Family's 30 kids for a few hours of the day. The need for a proper learning environment for the growth of the children is paramount to this success story. With your help, the Chantal Paydar Foundation and the Billian Music Family will purchase a piece of property within the Mathare Slum to convert into a youth centre for learning music, community development, and leadership. The goal is to have a place where children will come and feel wanted, where they are free to express themselves and learn to sing, dance, and play instruments as all children should. </p>

Many lives are going to be directly transformed through the youth art center by empowering the youth to express themselves and gaining knowledge of a talent they have within. The centre has this power to change the lives of youth by giving them options they do not know exist. Options to work hard in discovering and mastering their musical talents while learning how to become valuable members of their community and important leadership skills. The problems of the Mathare slums are many, but until today we have very little answers to them. The community youth centre can be one of the answers for our community.

<p></p>
<p>**This is an urgent call for help.** I have done everything humanly possible to get to this point.</p>
<p>Situation (Updated For Better Clarity):</p>
<p>I didn't want to dish on someone else, yet I'm getting a handful of hate messages saying GET A JOB. So the J-O-B is actually what got me here. After recovering from the massive liver infection, the housing I could get was work trade helping a woman start her business plus her California paid in home care. I swallowed my ego and took it.</p>
<p>A month and a half after I moved in, she got diagnosed with Borderline Personality. It was a long slow slide. Eventually, she got erratic, broke some of my stuff, moved most to storage and I started rushing plans to escape. It got to where she had NO boundaries, tried to take up all my time (the majority of it unpaid), and disrupted my schedule whenever possible while trying to get new work, gigs and business clients…in her co-dependency she had to be the constant center of attention.</p>
<p>One night I got home from a business networking event. She had booze in hand. I saw a new box full of painkillers in the corner. She was loaded, had a psychotic episode, threatened me and the neighbors called the police from her noise.</p>
<p>Even though I had tenant rights, the police said they could only guarantee my safety if I moved out right then. My spiritual mentor came across the bay and got me from the nearby bus stop at 1:30 am to stay on her couch overnight. I was able to secure a warehouse stay briefly.</p>
<p>After that, I have barely had time to secure new rental housing, not enough time for new work/gigs/business clients. Now, after just having moved in an apartment with a friend, I am already facing eviction due to lack of further funds. I don't really have anything significant left to sell for cash.</p>
<div>I immediately need enough funds to stabilize my housing situation, cover food, utilities, keep my business phone on, and counseling to recover from the trauma of my prior situation. The Indiegogo perks are client work products, so this isn't a handout. If you want something else, feel free to suggest. If you have any questions please message me.<p></p>
<p>More is below about my business plans and how I intend to pay it forward. My entire purpose and reason for being is to help women of ALL backgrounds find freedom in their lives and work.</p>
<div>My eternal gratitude. THANK YOU!! &lt;3 <p></p>
<p>Immediate Needs:</p>
<div>$500 – One month rent*<p></p>
<p>$125 – Utilities, transportation, internet, plus business phone lifeline</p>
<div>$300 – 1 month healthy food, supplies, vitamins and necessary medication<p></p>
<p>$150 – 1 month sliding scale therapy</p>
<div>$85 – Indiegogo/Paypal fees estimate<div>-----<div>$1160<p></p>
<p>*Note: Was $650…got a partial reduction helping the landlord with cleaning.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial Journey:</p>
<p>I am intersex, raised as a boy yet mentally, emotionally, and hormonally more female. I was misunderstood, bullied in childhood, harassed in the corporate world. My father committed suicide in February 2005 over drinking and gambling problems. I blamed myself for not being more available. I had a near death experience (NDE), then lost my last day job.</p>
<p>It became clear the only path was my own venture. After moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010, while finishing schooling in Non-Profit and Business Management, I started helping local small business owners, experimenting with a number of different potential niches that mixed in advertising, marketing, professional and digital organizing and more. I made the rounds at local weekend seminars and women's meetup business events. </p>
<p>In 2011, I taught a Motivational Life and Business Coaching program at API Wellness in San Francisco. This past year I lead Skillshare business classes on Social Media, Branding, Marketing, Messaging and more at Wix Lounge SF.</p>
<p>I have plans to help many others, now encapsulating all I've learned into the new business skills training program I'm about to start offering. A new business mentor just arrived on Monday (she is being an angel offering her guidance initially for free), however I need time in September to implement the crucial information she has provided.</p>
<div><div>My WHY is being a conduit for women of ALL backgrounds to be their kick-ass, fully activated, authentic, and expressive selves while powerfully manifesting their business dreams. As part of my promise to ""pay it forward"" for this help, I will always keep at least one low-cost scholarship open in my business offerings to help women, especially queer and transgender women.<div>AGAIN, THANK YOU!! &lt;3 <p></p>

[Note: Please donate via paypal if possible, thank you!! Only paypal donations are received immediately, e-checks, bank card etc are held until a week after the end. Please also spread the word with Indiegogo's share tools.]

**This is an urgent call for help.** I have done everything humanly possible to get to this point.
Situation (Updated For Better Clarity):
I didn't want to dish on someone else, yet I'm getting a handful of hate messages saying GET A JOB. So the J-O-B is actually what got me here. After recovering from the massive liver infection, the housing I could get was work trade helping a woman start her business plus her California paid in home care. I swallowed my ego and took it.
A month and a half after I moved in, she got diagnosed with Borderline Personality. It was a long slow slide. Eventually, she got erratic, broke some of my stuff, moved most to storage and I started rushing plans to escape. It got to where she had NO boundaries, tried to take up all my time (the majority of it unpaid), and disrupted my schedule whenever possible while trying to get new work, gigs and business clients…in her co-dependency she had to be the constant center of attention.
One night I got home from a business networking event. She had booze in hand. I saw a new box full of painkillers in the corner. She was loaded, had a psychotic episode, threatened me and the neighbors called the police from her noise.
Even though I had tenant rights, the police said they could only guarantee my safety if I moved out right then. My spiritual mentor came across the bay and got me from the nearby bus stop at 1:30 am to stay on her couch overnight. I was able to secure a warehouse stay briefly.
After that, I have barely had time to secure new rental housing, not enough time for new work/gigs/business clients. Now, after just having moved in an apartment with a friend, I am already facing eviction due to lack of further funds. I don't really have anything significant left to sell for cash.
I immediately need enough funds to stabilize my housing situation, cover food, utilities, keep my business phone on, and counseling to recover from the trauma of my prior situation. The Indiegogo perks are client work products, so this isn't a handout. If you want something else, feel free to suggest. If you have any questions please message me.
More is below about my business plans and how I intend to pay it forward. My entire purpose and reason for being is to help women of ALL backgrounds find freedom in their lives and work.
My eternal gratitude. THANK YOU!! <3 
Immediate Needs:
$500 – One month rent*
$125 – Utilities, transportation, internet, plus business phone lifeline
$300 – 1 month healthy food, supplies, vitamins and necessary medication
$150 – 1 month sliding scale therapy
$85 – Indiegogo/Paypal fees estimate-----$1160
*Note: Was $650…got a partial reduction helping the landlord with cleaning.
Entrepreneurial Journey:
I am intersex, raised as a boy yet mentally, emotionally, and hormonally more female. I was misunderstood, bullied in childhood, harassed in the corporate world. My father committed suicide in February 2005 over drinking and gambling problems. I blamed myself for not being more available. I had a near death experience (NDE), then lost my last day job.
It became clear the only path was my own venture. After moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010, while finishing schooling in Non-Profit and Business Management, I started helping local small business owners, experimenting with a number of different potential niches that mixed in advertising, marketing, professional and digital organizing and more. I made the rounds at local weekend seminars and women's meetup business events. 
In 2011, I taught a Motivational Life and Business Coaching program at API Wellness in San Francisco. This past year I lead Skillshare business classes on Social Media, Branding, Marketing, Messaging and more at Wix Lounge SF.
I have plans to help many others, now encapsulating all I've learned into the new business skills training program I'm about to start offering. A new business mentor just arrived on Monday (she is being an angel offering her guidance initially for free), however I need time in September to implement the crucial information she has provided.
My WHY is being a conduit for women of ALL backgrounds to be their kick-ass, fully activated, authentic, and expressive selves while powerfully manifesting their business dreams. As part of my promise to ""pay it forward"" for this help, I will always keep at least one low-cost scholarship open in my business offerings to help women, especially queer and transgender women.AGAIN, THANK YOU!! <3",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

My name is Umesh Pai, I am based in Sydney, Australia. </p>
<p><b>About myself and my business venture</b>. I am an electronic engineer, now involved in my start-up called GalaxC. The business is registered in Sydney since 2008 (ACN: 130 907 274) </p>
<p><strong>About the product</strong>: GalaxC is an innovative web-application, a tool for Consumers and Businesses to transact business and enjoy several unique benefits (not available from the other alternatives). Details follow below. </p>
<p><strong>Click here: </strong><a href=""http://au.galaxc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.GalaxC.com</strong> (redirecting to Australian sub-domain site)</a></p>
<p><b>Our Values:</b> I want GalaxC to be a community focused business with strong ethical and social responsibility (paying its fair share of taxes and committing to return 5% to 10% of profits back to the community for worthy causes or projects in every country). </p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong> To be the preferred e-marketplace with a globally recognizable brand, that every Consumer and every business in the world would want to use - to buy or sell a product or a service.</p>
<p><b>Mission</b>: (1) To help every Consumer and Business save time and money while buying or selling any service or product (2) To build trust in the marketplace between the two groups. (3) To raise the bar for customer service standards.</p>
<p><b>My Team</b>: We will seek like-minded experienced executives and a reputed board of directors at the appropriate time and will also be head-hunting a top ICT professional to implement future development plans. (<i><strong>Until then we have a small Team working towards the same goals,</strong> including our outsourced software developer<strong>)</strong></i> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/145316/files/20131021044858-Team_GalaxC_2___Indiegogo.png?1382356138"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>How it came about</b>: Having experienced a lot of frustration and financial pain, both as a Consumer and as a Provider, I had been thinking about a solution as far back as 2004. I actually started seriously researching and developing the solution while recuperating after an operation in 2007. I soon learnt from many of my friends that these marketplace problems are actually quite common.  </p>
<p>Without an ICT / software background and inability to find a co-founder with the right background, outsourcing was inevitable. GalaxC is the result. So far, we have used our own money including contributions from friends and family. The delay has been mainly due to the funds running out. The product is now ready for the real test - in the actual marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>A product introduction video:</strong></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tr54K2HHM0?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><b>The background: The problem with present methods</b> of buying or selling anything, whether service or product – using directories (like Yellow Pages), Search Engines (mostly Google) or RFQ / broker sites, to search for Providers (businesses) or get quotes - is that they do not provide efficient or reliable solutions, to say the least. This is because: </p>
<p>Consumers cannot shop around easily to get best possible <b>Value for their Money </b>(which encompasses the price, quality / reliability, delivery times, their own preferences and the process itself). Booking the best value is even more difficult if the requirement is urgent.</p>
<p>Providers (Businesses) 'waste' too much money on advertising and lead generation and waste time on the wrong type of customers or prospects, paying for spurious leads etc. Online methods like SEO or SEM are neither quick nor cheap, and have been getting more expensive over time as more providers compete online for Consumers' eyeballs using search engines.</p>
<p><b>The GalaxC solution for Consumers</b> lets them get the best possible Value deal for their money or budget, for any service or product – without Searches, reading reviews, multiple telephone calls or emails to request quotes, haggling, quote comparisons. Some exceptions exist, but they are still simpler and quicker than the present methods. </p>
<p><b>The GalaxC solution for Providers</b> offers virtually unlimited FREE leads of the highest quality through RFQs (requests for quotes) from purchase-ready and committed Consumers from their chosen territory who are looking for reliable Providers and value for their money. GalaxC makes it possible for Quality Providers to win with higher quote amounts. Only the winning Provider pays a small Success Fee. </p>
<p><strong>GalaxC meets universal marketplace needs</strong> because it helps Consumers get what they want - the best value for the money they spend - any number of times in a year. Aren't we all consumers? And businesses owners want to save time and money in every part of the world and improve their productivity. GalaxC offers real solutions – not just search results or poor choice offered by our competition. </p>
<p>By cutting the costs for businesses through unlimited leads (virtually FREE), and by creating fairer competition, we help the national economy in each market / country. </p>

<p><b>This campaign and its importance</b>: </p>
<p>This campaign is very important because the project is awaiting funds injection required for the Pilot Test to show market 'traction', to some big investors / prospective partners (even though they have seen the product demo and like the product). After the Pilot Test, we expect to form strategic alliances with reputed corporations who share our values, vision and goal.</p>
<p><b>What the contributions will help me achieve: </b></p>
<p>The Pilot Test is expected to validate the platform, prove the business model, get some publicity through the media, and get the 'traction' that was recommended by some prospective strategic partners. We expect to be well placed for getting the bigger funding required for the next stage and even for ramping up global deployment which will be in phases. The Pilot is expected sometime in December (2013) - January 2014.</p>
<p><b>What we need</b> (for our immediate needs centred on the Pilot Test): </p>
<p>We are seeking $100K - about 3.5% of our original budget of $A3M for Australian<br/>(national) roll-out as the geography for this Pilot is a very small part of Sydney. This estimate is approximate and includes allowance for contingencies.</p>
<p><b>The Breakup of expenses for the Pilot + other immediate tasks (over 3-5 months)</b>: $100K. The amount is allocated for the following tasks / expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ads for awareness creation / membership $20K</li>
<li>Preparation: (Videos, content, T&amp;C, <b>Mobile App</b> + webinars/seminars) $14K</li>
<li>Bug-fixing (post Pilot / Beta) + refinements &amp; desirable features $18K</li>
<li>Live Customer Support 2-3 people @ $3-4K/m (for 3-4months)  $25K</li>
<li>Insurance, Hosting, SMS Gateway, IP issues etc. $11K</li>
<li>Approx. Fees (PayPal + Indiegogo) + Contingency $12K</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why this project is valuable to you, the contributor and to the world:</b></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> This product can <strong>save hundreds to thousands of dollars every year for every Consumer and every Business</strong> - depending on how often they use it. </p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>If you like supporting the underdog, or an ethical business with strong corporate social responsibility and be part of something benevolent on a global scale, please join us. Let us create some pleasant ripples or maybe even cause a big revolution. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. We firmly believe we can create a popular global brand, and a business which can help Consumers and businesses around the world. It is your privilege to make this happen. GalaxC will be taking on the biggest guns and we need all the support we can get. </p>
<p><strong>4</strong>. You would be able to give something back to your community and your country. GalaxC values deem it a privilege for a company to pay more in taxes; giving back to the community is part of its social responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. Your contribution is highly valued and will be duly recognized. The perk itself is also very valuable when compared with competing products in the market. Your help in promoting the GalaxC campaign through your social media network is also very welcome and will prove extremely useful to serve you in your city, faster.

<p>L’objectif initial du Parallèle 40 est de 5 000$, ce qui serait suffisant pour peinturer 18 colonnes à partir de l’axe

who are committed to the “Parallele40” Project, which  will help provide
Montreal with infrastructures that its communities will enjoy and pride
themselves with.</p>
<p><b>Why young engineers?</b></p>
<p>Why not? Like many professionals,  we want to get involved
in our community and try to make a difference outside of our day-to-day

<p><b>And what do we offer?</b></p>
<p>We offer you the “Parallele40” Project: We want to paint, embellish and much

we want to redevelop the space under the Highway 40. Starting with the intersection of
Henri-Julien and Crémazie this summer, we want to start by beautifying the
passage under Highway 40 by painting columns with stencil designs to remind citizens that this space can be warm and welcoming. This project will team up professionals, artists and Teens from l'<a href=""http://www.centredesjeuneslescale.com/nouvelles-jeunes.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Escale</a> center and other groups of young volunteers from <a href=""http://www.c-vert.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">C-Vert</a> and <a href=""http://trajetoja.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trajet</a>.

<p><b>The space under the

<p>Paint, and that’s mostly it. We want to paint the existing
concrete columns. To perform this task we need quality paint that will not
deteriorate. We also need signaling and storage since we will be working on a site of the Ministry of Transport. And again, there must be all the costs associated with the
safety of the team of 45 volunteers, participants, artists and engineers, who will work
with us to paint the columns.</p>
<p><b>And how much do we need?</b></p>
<p>The project is scalable.  The first step will require $ 5,000. It would be enough to paint 18 columns. starting from the Henri-Julien axis, offer perks and equipment renting. We managed to establish a cost per column, which means that any extra money raised involves more columns to be painted and a bigger scale of the project. </p>
<p><b>What’s in it for you?</b></p>
<p>A new user-friendly area for pedestrians underneath
the Highway 40. A place to take a coffee break or stroll. And above all, the
possibility for expansion of urban life under the Highway 40.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>""Parallele40"" is an initiative that wants to trigger a reaction
that will rejuvenate the area. It is our desire to repeat the project every
year and make it important enough to allow us to redevelop a large portion underneath the Highway 40. The ultimate goal will be to make of the ""Parallele40"" a
lively urban park in the same vein as the ""<a href=""http://www.thehighline.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HighLine</a>"" of New York. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the challenges we originally faced have been overcome with the support of public officials and the boroughs. The only remaining
challenge we must solve is funding through private means, as there are no
public funding attributed to this project, since it’s been initiated and
organized by citizens. The project scope will be proportional to the donations
obtained.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Court résumé du projet 
Qui sommes-nous ?
AFG Québec (Association des firmes de génie-conseil du Québec). Nous sommes un regroupement bénévole issu de l’industrie du
génie-conseil au Québec. À l’intérieur de l’AFG il y a le Forum des Jeunes
Professionnels et c’est nous, dans le cadre de l’évènement ""Je vois MTL"" maintenant devenu ""Je fais MTL"",
qui nous sommes engagés à réaliser le projet du Parallèle 40, une initiative communautaire contribuant à doter
Montréal d’infrastructures à l’image de ses citoyens.  Pourquoi des jeunes
ingénieurs ?
Pourquoi pas? Comme bien des professionnels nous
voulons nous impliquer dans notre communauté et essayer de faire une différence
en-dehors de notre cadre professionnel. Nous voulons mettre en pratique notre expertise et nos talent de gestion de projet, d'autant plus qu'il s'agit d'ouvrages issus de notre milieu. Qui plus est, ce projet nous permettra de sortir de nos
tâches classiques et de travailler avec la communauté.   
Et qu’est-ce que
vous proposez ?
Nous vous proposons le projet du Parallèle 40! Nous voulons peinturer, embellir et bien plus! Grace à
l’autorisation du Ministère des Transports et des arrondissements voisins, nous
voulons réaménager le dessous de l’autoroute 40.  En débutant par
l’intersection Henri-Julien et Crémazie, dès cet été, nous voulons commencer
par embellir le passage sous l’autoroute 40 en y peinturant, à l’aide de
pochoirs, des designs rappelant aux citoyens que cet espace peut être
accueillant. Ce projet se fera en équipe avec des professionnels, des artistes, des éco-quartiers et des jeunes
provenant du centre l'Escale ainsi que d'autre équipes de jeunes
provenant des organismes C-Vert et Trajet. Un des objectifs du Parallèle 40 est de favoriser
les rapprochements entre les jeunes et les professionnels et de partager
l’intérêt face à l’implication communautaire. Ce projet sert de catalyseur afin de
motiver les citoyens et les arrondissements dans le but de rendre le dessous de
l’autoroute 40 un endroit invitant et qui sait, un jour, un incontournable de
la vie urbaine de Montréal.
Ce dont nous avons de besoin et ce que
vous obtenez
Le dessous de l’autoroute 40 c’est
moche, et qu’est-ce qu’il nous faut pour arranger ça ?
De la peinture et c’est presque tout. Nous voulons
peinturer les colonnes de béton existantes. Pour réaliser cette tâche, il faut
bien entendu une peinture de qualité qui ne se détériorera pas. Il faut aussi
du balisage et de l’entreposage puisque nous travaillons sur le site du
Ministère des Transports. Et de plus, il faut prévoir tous les coûts associés à
la sécurité de l’équipe de 45 bénévoles, artistes, jeunes et divers professionnels, qui travailleront avec nous pour peindre les colonnes.
De combien avons-nous besoin?
L’objectif initial du Parallèle 40 est de 5 000$, ce qui serait suffisant pour peinturer 18 colonnes à partir de l’axe
Henri-Julien, fournir des contreparties et louer des équipements. On arrive à établir un coût par colonne, ce qui
veut dire que si nous dépassons notre objectif, nous pouvons peinturer
davantage de colonnes.
Qu’est-ce que vous
en retirez ?
Une nouvelle aire plus conviviale pour circuler en dessous de l’autoroute 40. Un endroit où prendre une pause ou flâner un peu. Et surtout, un
potentiel d’expansion de la vie urbaine sous l’autoroute 40.

Summary
Who are we?
The AFG, Association of Consulting Engineers of Quebec. We are a voluntary organization emerging from the consulting engineering
industry. Inside AFG there is the Young Professionals Forum and it is us, as
part of the movement ""I see MTL"" who has now become ""Je fais MTL"",
who are committed to the “Parallele40” Project, which  will help provide
Montreal with infrastructures that its communities will enjoy and pride
themselves with.
Why young engineers?
Why not? Like many professionals,  we want to get involved
in our community and try to make a difference outside of our day-to-day
professional practice. We want to apply our expertise and project management
skills, espacially since these works come from our field.  Also, this project will take us out of our traditional tasks and
will get us to build something meaningful with the community which benefits from

And what do we offer?
We offer you the “Parallele40” Project: We want to paint, embellish and much

we want to redevelop the space under the Highway 40. Starting with the intersection of
Henri-Julien and Crémazie this summer, we want to start by beautifying the
passage under Highway 40 by painting columns with stencil designs to remind citizens that this space can be warm and welcoming. This project will team up professionals, artists and Teens from l'Escale center and other groups of young volunteers from C-Vert and Trajet.

community involvement and citizen-driven initiatives. This project serves as a
catalyst to motivate citizens and districts in order to make the space under

What We Need & What
You Get
The space under the
Highway 40 is ugly and uninviting, but what do we need to fix it?
Paint, and that’s mostly it. We want to paint the existing
concrete columns. To perform this task we need quality paint that will not
deteriorate. We also need signaling and storage since we will be working on a site of the Ministry of Transport. And again, there must be all the costs associated with the
safety of the team of 45 volunteers, participants, artists and engineers, who will work
with us to paint the columns.
And how much do we need?
The project is scalable.  The first step will require $ 5,000. It would be enough to paint 18 columns. starting from the Henri-Julien axis, offer perks and equipment renting. We managed to establish a cost per column, which means that any extra money raised involves more columns to be painted and a bigger scale of the project. 
What’s in it for you?
A new user-friendly area for pedestrians underneath
the Highway 40. A place to take a coffee break or stroll. And above all, the
possibility for expansion of urban life under the Highway 40.
Impact
""Parallele40"" is an initiative that wants to trigger a reaction
that will rejuvenate the area. It is our desire to repeat the project every
year and make it important enough to allow us to redevelop a large portion underneath the Highway 40. The ultimate goal will be to make of the ""Parallele40"" a
lively urban park in the same vein as the ""HighLine"" of New York. 
Risks & Challenges
Most of the challenges we originally faced have been overcome with the support of public officials and the boroughs. The only remaining
challenge we must solve is funding through private means, as there are no
public funding attributed to this project, since it’s been initiated and
organized by citizens. The project scope will be proportional to the donations
obtained.

<p>Here at Grillinator, we source and sell high quality BBQ grilling accessories. Grill brushes are the #1 product in the category, so it only makes sense we need a grill brush to be a part of our product line. </p>
<p>Unfortunately upon due diligence in the summer of 2014, we realized there is a major liability aspect to selling grill brushes due to the risk of bristles coming loose, getting stuck in your food and moving on to your stomach. We didn't want any part of that.</p>
<p>Going beyond the safety aspect, we're also committed to selling products that don't suck. Unfortunately, every ounce of our combined grilling expertise told us that every grill brush sucks in one way or another. Just to be sure, we purchased and tested every brush on the market... and yep, they all had at least one major flaw. Here is what we found...</p>
<p>METAL HAIR PLUG BRISTLES </p>
<p>Pros: The good ones clean decently well.<br/>Cons: Testing showed highest risk of bristle balding.<br/>Conclusion: We're branded as the Grillin' &amp; Chillin' boys and since there isn't much chillin' to be had in the ER, we crossed these off our list.</p>

<p>METAL SPINDLE BOUND BRISTLES: </p>
<p>Pros: Bristles are virtually impossible to yank out with high quality brands.<br/>Cons: Cleans in-between your grill grate, or on top... but not both.<br/>Conclusion: Buy quality brands in both styles to get the job done safely.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466689429/hxqwifxuar1eygygeb5e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>NYLON HAIR PLUG BRISTLES: </p>
<p>Pros: Hard to miss these bristles even if they do fall out.<br/>Cons: Just doesn't get the job done.<br/>Conclusion: If you need a brush to clean dishes, this is perfect.</p>

<p>Wood &amp; Metal Scrapers:</p>

<p>A Long Story Short...</p>
<p>The only way we found to safely &amp; effectively clean a grill with current off the shelf products is to buy multiple styles of grill brushes which is both expensive and time consuming. We really wanted to find a grill brush to sell, but just couldn't find anything worthy of the Grillinator name, so we decided to build one from scratch.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a year ago, 3/26/15 to be exact, we ponied up a large R&amp;D fee and got the process started. Since that time, we've gone through more than a half dozen prototypes. We've also made a few more R&amp;D payments than we expected. It's all been worth it. We have a product we're proud of that outperforms anything on the market. </p>
<p>With your help in backing our campaign, we can turn our final prototype into a mass production reality. We're confident the Grillinator will be the last BBQ grill brush you'll ever own.</p>

<p>We are friends. We are family. We are business partners. We LOVE to grill and we LOVE to chill. We’ve known each other for years and have been working together as long. Our passion for some great BBQ, fun times and family brought us together and spawned the development of the Grillinator Brand of BBQ Tools, Gadgets and Products that you can only get from The Boys at Grillin’ and Chillin’.</p>
<p>We’ve been working together on this project for more than a year from across many miles and are so excited to see the creation of the Grillinator Grill brush become a reality and help take the BBQ experience to the next level.</p>
<p>Shawn holds down the fort in Missouri. Damien is the true blue Texan born and bred and Brad is from Michigan but got to Texas as fast as he could. We’re here to have fun, share our passion with the world and offer people first class products and an unmatched customer experience.</p>

Unfortunately upon due diligence in the summer of 2014, we realized there is a major liability aspect to selling grill brushes due to the risk of bristles coming loose, getting stuck in your food and moving on to your stomach. We didn't want any part of that.
Going beyond the safety aspect, we're also committed to selling products that don't suck. Unfortunately, every ounce of our combined grilling expertise told us that every grill brush sucks in one way or another. Just to be sure, we purchased and tested every brush on the market... and yep, they all had at least one major flaw. Here is what we found...
METAL HAIR PLUG BRISTLES 
Pros: The good ones clean decently well.Cons: Testing showed highest risk of bristle balding.Conclusion: We're branded as the Grillin' & Chillin' boys and since there isn't much chillin' to be had in the ER, we crossed these off our list.

METAL SPINDLE BOUND BRISTLES: 
Pros: Bristles are virtually impossible to yank out with high quality brands.Cons: Cleans in-between your grill grate, or on top... but not both.Conclusion: Buy quality brands in both styles to get the job done safely.

NYLON HAIR PLUG BRISTLES: 
Pros: Hard to miss these bristles even if they do fall out.Cons: Just doesn't get the job done.Conclusion: If you need a brush to clean dishes, this is perfect.

Wood & Metal Scrapers:
Pros: Cleans top of your grill grate really well.Cons: Doesn't clean in-between grill grate at all.Conclusion: Must be combined with another brush to get the job done.

A Long Story Short...
The only way we found to safely & effectively clean a grill with current off the shelf products is to buy multiple styles of grill brushes which is both expensive and time consuming. We really wanted to find a grill brush to sell, but just couldn't find anything worthy of the Grillinator name, so we decided to build one from scratch.
Almost exactly a year ago, 3/26/15 to be exact, we ponied up a large R&D fee and got the process started. Since that time, we've gone through more than a half dozen prototypes. We've also made a few more R&D payments than we expected. It's all been worth it. We have a product we're proud of that outperforms anything on the market. 
With your help in backing our campaign, we can turn our final prototype into a mass production reality. We're confident the Grillinator will be the last BBQ grill brush you'll ever own.


We are friends. We are family. We are business partners. We LOVE to grill and we LOVE to chill. We’ve known each other for years and have been working together as long. Our passion for some great BBQ, fun times and family brought us together and spawned the development of the Grillinator Brand of BBQ Tools, Gadgets and Products that you can only get from The Boys at Grillin’ and Chillin’.
We’ve been working together on this project for more than a year from across many miles and are so excited to see the creation of the Grillinator Grill brush become a reality and help take the BBQ experience to the next level.
Shawn holds down the fort in Missouri. Damien is the true blue Texan born and bred and Brad is from Michigan but got to Texas as fast as he could. We’re here to have fun, share our passion with the world and offer people first class products and an unmatched customer experience.

It is rare for communities like Carson CA to have mental health counseling. Within this community, we've found that counseling and therapy is not viewed as necessary. This is because of the steep costs of counseling.


Where does my donation go?

     Your donation goes directly to the costs it takes for counseling.

Normally, we would have to charge clients $100-150/session, and many times YMI functions on a sliding scale and even performs many pro-bono sessions. However, in order to cover our overhead costs of labor, office space, utilities, which total $1500/month, we must charge at least $100/session in order to avoid going into a deficit. 
Over the course of one year, YMI spends $18,000 to cover overhead costs, and these costs are being paid by the people we are trying to help. 
 Although our clients need counseling every week, it is far too expensive for them to come continually. Many times we see our clients discontinue the counseling that is changing their lives all because of monetary constraints.
We would like to raise money so they can continually receive help without worrying about their finances. They already have enough to worry about.
We ask for enough donations to cover a year because continual counseling leads to  exponential development in one's emotional, psychological, and spiritual health. Weekly counseling helps them grow incrementally, and their progress occurs over time. 

Why this campaign?

Sexual abuse is one of the most traumatizing forms of abuse that can occur. The pain and trauma occurs on a  chemical, emotional, psychological, and even spiritual level. Because of this, it takes extra time to reverse the effects, so blessing women who have undergone this is one of our passions.

If we exceed our goal, we will give free counseling to as many women as possible. 
Also if we exceed our goal, we would like to make video documentaries  for all of the contributors to see. In this way, you can see the effect your donation has directly. This will only occur, however, if we meet and exceed our goal.

of Danville, Illinois.  We specialize in retro/new video games, 
accessories, vintage/new toys, as well as comics, DVDs, CDs, 
posters, clothing, trading card games and more.  The store itself has been in several different locations since 2011, and with each move we've expanded and improved upon our previous space. The new location of Vintage Villains will finally allow our business to incorporate many of the ideas we have wanted since day one but were limited because of space restraints.  Several of those ideas are as follows:<br/></p><ul>
<li>The addition of an in house retro gaming museum.</li>
<li>Space to house local all age events such as concerts, stand up, theater, wrestling, gaming tournaments and more.</li>
<li>Expanding our ever growing FREE TO PLAY arcade.</li>
</ul>   The move to the new location began in late January, and will continue until our tentative opening date of April 1st 2014.  This is an extremely ambitious and risky move for Vintage Villains; and comes at a high cost! We are seeking help from backers to help fund this transition and to help make this move as smooth as possible. We are hoping to raise $30,000 to cover some of our many expenses. Budget break down is as follows.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>$10,000 PA and Light Budget for the entertainment center</li>
<li>$6600 Arcade Repair and Expansion</li>
<li>$1600 Folding Chairs (100)</li>
<li>$2000 Construction Supplies</li>
<li>$4500 Museum Displays</li>
<li>$2000 New Store Displays</li>
<li>$500 Stage <br/>
</li>
<li>$1200 New Tables (20)</li>
<li>$1600 Licensed Workers (Electrical, General Contractor)</li>
<li>If extra money is made during this funding campaign the money will be used to further expand the Arcade and Museum areas of the shop.<br/>

of Danville, Illinois.  We specialize in retro/new video games, 
accessories, vintage/new toys, as well as comics, DVDs, CDs, 
posters, clothing, trading card games and more.  The store itself has been in several different locations since 2011, and with each move we've expanded and improved upon our previous space. The new location of Vintage Villains will finally allow our business to incorporate many of the ideas we have wanted since day one but were limited because of space restraints.  Several of those ideas are as follows:
The addition of an in house retro gaming museum.
Space to house local all age events such as concerts, stand up, theater, wrestling, gaming tournaments and more.
Expanding our ever growing FREE TO PLAY arcade.
   The move to the new location began in late January, and will continue until our tentative opening date of April 1st 2014.  This is an extremely ambitious and risky move for Vintage Villains; and comes at a high cost! We are seeking help from backers to help fund this transition and to help make this move as smooth as possible. We are hoping to raise $30,000 to cover some of our many expenses. Budget break down is as follows.
$10,000 PA and Light Budget for the entertainment center
$6600 Arcade Repair and Expansion
$1600 Folding Chairs (100)
$2000 Construction Supplies
$4500 Museum Displays
$2000 New Store Displays
$500 Stage 

$1200 New Tables (20)
$1600 Licensed Workers (Electrical, General Contractor)
If extra money is made during this funding campaign the money will be used to further expand the Arcade and Museum areas of the shop.

<p><span style=""text-align: justify;"">The Story:</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;"">In December 2012, I visited eKhaya eKasi, an art and education centre in Khayelitsha, a township outside Cape Town, South Africa. I learned of the many issues women
are faced with. HIV/AIDS is an epidemic; unemployment is high as is domestic
abuse and alcoholism. For many, education does not advance beyond the grade 9
level and there is very little social assistance available. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; text-align: center;"">Women are raising their children alone. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; text-align: center;"">Grandmothers
are raising their children’s children. </span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Unemployment rates are 80% and most live on a few dollars a day or less. </b><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Many still live in makeshift
buildings without electricity or water. </p>
<p>Women are the heart of their families and communities and I believe it is the Heart of a Woman that will persevere, inspire and empower other women in their communities and elsewhere. </p>
<p>The model of <b><i>education and empowerment through the arts</i></b> inspired me and I came up with an idea of how to help using mobile photography. </p>

<p><b>Workshop Date:</b> November 15 - November 29, 2013</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Location:</b> eKhaya eKasi Art &amp; Education Centre, Khayelitsha, South Africa. </p>
<p></p>
<p>eKhaya eKasi is an Art &amp; Education Center that works to benefit the Khayelitsha community through a programs that target illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, the AIDS epidemic and lack of social services.  eKhaya eKasi is the perfect model to pilot this project as it is already established in the community and serves over 400 women, children and men and welcomes tourists from around the world. </p>
<p>As a woman and mother, the visit to eKhaya eKasi and Khayelitsha spoke to me. They are
mothers just like I am and all they want is what I want for my children,
to be happy and healthy and to have a better life than the life we have. </p>
<p>As a daughter and granddaughter of immigrants from a developing country, Myanmar (Burma), I know how easily it could be me, it could be my children. </p>

The Story:
In December 2012, I visited eKhaya eKasi, an art and education centre in Khayelitsha, a township outside Cape Town, South Africa. I learned of the many issues women
are faced with. HIV/AIDS is an epidemic; unemployment is high as is domestic
abuse and alcoholism. For many, education does not advance beyond the grade 9
level and there is very little social assistance available. Women are raising their children alone. Grandmothers
are raising their children’s children. 
Unemployment rates are 80% and most live on a few dollars a day or less. 
Many still live in makeshift
buildings without electricity or water. 
Women are the heart of their families and communities and I believe it is the Heart of a Woman that will persevere, inspire and empower other women in their communities and elsewhere. 
The model of education and empowerment through the arts inspired me and I came up with an idea of how to help using mobile photography.

The Pilot Project - heART South Africa
To educate unemployed mothers and young women (15 years+) of eKhaya eKasi, in mobile photography to empower and to fight poverty by creating a small business and sustainable income through the sales of photographic art products in the on-site art boutique.  
Workshop Date: November 15 - November 29, 2013


Location: eKhaya eKasi Art & Education Centre, Khayelitsha, South Africa. 

eKhaya eKasi is an Art & Education Center that works to benefit the Khayelitsha community through a programs that target illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, the AIDS epidemic and lack of social services.  eKhaya eKasi is the perfect model to pilot this project as it is already established in the community and serves over 400 women, children and men and welcomes tourists from around the world. 
As a woman and mother, the visit to eKhaya eKasi and Khayelitsha spoke to me. They are
mothers just like I am and all they want is what I want for my children,
to be happy and healthy and to have a better life than the life we have. 
As a daughter and granddaughter of immigrants from a developing country, Myanmar (Burma), I know how easily it could be me, it could be my children. 



eKhaya eKasi Art & Education Centre - December 10, 2012


As a professional photographer and small business entrepreneur of 10 years in Toronto, Canada, I will bring my experience and knowledge in photography, mobile photography, social media and small business for photography. 

What the Participants Will Learn during the Workshop

mobile technology and mobile photography 
photography fundamentals with a focus on lighting and composition
how to select, edit and prepare images for print as photographic art products
social media and small business for photography

Goal: Each participant will have 200 art cards produced from 1 image to be available for sale in the on-site boutique at eKhaya eKasi by the end of the workshop and through distribution in the Tourism and Fair Trade industry. If ONE tourist buys ONE art card, it can feed a family that day. What is only a few dollars to us in the developed world... a Starbucks latte, goes a much longer way in developing communities



What Will Your Donation Buy? 

mobile devices for participants should we not receive enough used iPhone 4/4s/5 donations
transportation to/from Cape Town so that they may participant in a hands on photo walk for 2 days as Khayelitsha is not safe for a group of our size
lunch during the workshop and photo walks
tour bus fees
production of photographic art products
produce perks, Indiegogo, Paypal fees
marketing and printed materials
accessories such as mobile chargers and cases
administration & start up costs such as producing products and sample products
transportation or petrol for offsite trips (printer, distribution, internet cafe)
internet service and portable wifi unit 
internet cafe to upload images to central site
a laptop to store the images until they can be uploaded to a cloud facility to prevent image loss and for volunteers to edit and produce products abroad. 



How it could make an Impact:

Empowers 
Gives women a voice and a creative outlet
Allows a real perspective of a woman in a developing community
Offers skills in mobile technology, photography, internet, small business and social media 
Creates sustainable income
Supports the community and eKhaya eKasi 
Opportunity to teach other women
Inspires
Raises awareness
Creates change and makes a difference 


Volunteer Program at eKhaya eKasi & From HomeAt eKhaya eKasi: We hope to set up a
volunteer program for photographers, mobile photographers and social media
enthusiasts. It would be ideal for locals and travelers, especially for my
fellow photographers and bloggers. Anyone that has experience in these areas
(don't have to be a pro) can help and make a difference. From Home: We need help with social media and marketing and

<h4><span style=""color: #990033;"">White Chocolate Razz Jazz Jam <em>(Premium white chocolate and raspberry)</em></span></h4>
<h4><span style=""color: #990033;"">Blueberry Pear Fusion Jam <em>(Early Blues blueberries and Barlett pears)</em></span></h4>
<h4><span style=""color: #990033;"">Mango Tango Jam <em>(Mango, pineapple and strawberry)</em></span></h4>
<h4><span style=""color: #990033;"">Bubbly Be-Bop Strawberry Jam <em>(Fresh strawberries and champagne)</em></span></h4>
<p>DJ Mix is the result of what can happen when two good friends (Donna and Jane), who once made jam alone in their kitchens, realized how much fun it is to make jam as a duo. For two summers we created day-long excursions around our area of New England to find the best sources of local fruit. We spent hours in fields and orchards hand-picking, and then a long evening cleaning and processing the fruit so that we could cook jam all the next day, using the traditional recipes we had gathered throughout the years. This is our idea of an ideal summer vacation. </p>
<p>By the second summer we got hooked on trying unique combinations of fruits. We have spent many sultry July and August days bent over the steaming kettle on the stove, breathing in, and oohing and aahing over, the aromas of mixes of raspberries and peaches, strawberries and kiwis, blueberries and pears. We have always kept it simple; fresh fruits, sugar, and fruit pectin. Then we tried adding some simple touches to a batch here and there, like bananas with toasted walnuts, some spices, some liquors. By autumn we had so many jars of jam they were flowing like glass rivers through both of our houses. But we still had more concoctions to try. We gave them away as gifts, and then made more. We got many requests for more jams, and we still couldn't stop making more. That's when we decided it was time to start selling.</p>
<p>Seven months later we are cooking our jams in a local commercial kitchen, (thanks, Ebenezer's!) selling at the local farmer's market, and fulfilling a number of custom orders. It has been quite a process and learning experience to get this far, and we can't wait to keep going! We would like to continue to ""spread"" the jam-love to a wider audience. Our next goal is to get our jams into local specialty food stores and markets, and to be able to sell them online. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The process of getting a specialty food product into the marketplace is slow, grueling, and expensive. We are really passionate to move forward, but we have whittled down to the last of our savings to get this far, and are hoping that there are good folks out there, like you, who are kind enough to support us in our endeavors.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of our needs for the licensing process (which will allow us to sell at wholesale) and our first 60-gallon batch of our top 6 jam flavors to deliver to stores throughout Massachusetts. We will also be offering our jams online when we reach this critical point.</p>
<p>• Fruit, pectin and other ingredients — $1500</p>
<p>• Jars and lids — $500</p>
<p>• Labels — $800</p>
<p>• Product testing at Cornell plus nutrition analysis — $1100</p>
<p>• UPC codes — $800</p>
<p>• Application fee for licensing — $300</p>
<p>• Marketing, printing (sell sheets, etc.), shipping — $200</p>
<p>To show our heartfelt thanks for your generous support we would like to “jam” for you! With a thoughtful donation of $25 we will create a special “limited edition” jam that we guarantee you won't be able to find in any store. We will divulge the flavor at a later date, as we're continuing to run test batches in search of a combination that will get your feet tappin' and your taste buds singin'! And, since we're true New Englanders, we'll make it with the fresh fruits and flavors of the fall season.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We really want to spread the jam love around, but even as we slowly grow, there are certain things about DJ Mix that you can count on:</p>
<p>• We will continue supporting our local farmers in New England</p>
<p>• We will never use anything but fresh, natural ingredients (no preservatives or artificial ingredients, ever!)</p>
<p>• Even as we expand (we are optimistic) we will continue to work in small batches so that we have full control over quality</p>
<p>• We will continue to infuse our passion, creativity, love and laughter into our products</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute financially, and that's OK. However, you can still help us out immensely if you “tune” other people in to our cause. We would be so grateful!!</p>

For two summers we created day-long excursions around our area of New England to find the best sources of local fruit. We spent hours in fields and orchards hand-picking, and then a long evening cleaning and processing the fruit so that we could cook jam all the next day, using the traditional recipes we had gathered throughout the years. This is our idea of an ideal summer vacation. 
By the second summer we got hooked on trying unique combinations of fruits. We have spent many sultry July and August days bent over the steaming kettle on the stove, breathing in, and oohing and aahing over, the aromas of mixes of raspberries and peaches, strawberries and kiwis, blueberries and pears. We have always kept it simple; fresh fruits, sugar, and fruit pectin. Then we tried adding some simple touches to a batch here and there, like bananas with toasted walnuts, some spices, some liquors. By autumn we had so many jars of jam they were flowing like glass rivers through both of our houses. But we still had more concoctions to try. We gave them away as gifts, and then made more. We got many requests for more jams, and we still couldn't stop making more. That's when we decided it was time to start selling.
Seven months later we are cooking our jams in a local commercial kitchen, (thanks, Ebenezer's!) selling at the local farmer's market, and fulfilling a number of custom orders. It has been quite a process and learning experience to get this far, and we can't wait to keep going! We would like to continue to ""spread"" the jam-love to a wider audience. Our next goal is to get our jams into local specialty food stores and markets, and to be able to sell them online. 
What We Need & What You Get
The process of getting a specialty food product into the marketplace is slow, grueling, and expensive. We are really passionate to move forward, but we have whittled down to the last of our savings to get this far, and are hoping that there are good folks out there, like you, who are kind enough to support us in our endeavors.
Here is the breakdown of our needs for the licensing process (which will allow us to sell at wholesale) and our first 60-gallon batch of our top 6 jam flavors to deliver to stores throughout Massachusetts. We will also be offering our jams online when we reach this critical point.
• Fruit, pectin and other ingredients — $1500
• Jars and lids — $500
• Labels — $800
• Product testing at Cornell plus nutrition analysis — $1100
• UPC codes — $800
• Application fee for licensing — $300
• Marketing, printing (sell sheets, etc.), shipping — $200
To show our heartfelt thanks for your generous support we would like to “jam” for you! With a thoughtful donation of $25 we will create a special “limited edition” jam that we guarantee you won't be able to find in any store. We will divulge the flavor at a later date, as we're continuing to run test batches in search of a combination that will get your feet tappin' and your taste buds singin'! And, since we're true New Englanders, we'll make it with the fresh fruits and flavors of the fall season.

The Impact
We really want to spread the jam love around, but even as we slowly grow, there are certain things about DJ Mix that you can count on:
• We will continue supporting our local farmers in New England
• We will never use anything but fresh, natural ingredients (no preservatives or artificial ingredients, ever!)
• Even as we expand (we are optimistic) we will continue to work in small batches so that we have full control over quality
• We will continue to infuse our passion, creativity, love and laughter into our products


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute financially, and that's OK. However, you can still help us out immensely if you “tune” other people in to our cause. We would be so grateful!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Kiva is micro-financing nonprofit whose mission is to alleviate extreme poverty through connecting entrepreneurs and others living in need to basic financial services that are often out of their reach. Kiva's most common method of making this conneciton is through working with and strengthening local nonprofit banks and micro-lenders that already have a presence in these communites. </p>
<p>During my fellowship, I’ll be spending two months in the state of Manipur working with Kiva’s partner <a href=""http://www.kiva.org/partners/238"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WSDS Initiate</a>, which specifically serves women from some of the most vulnerable populations in the region. Following that, I will spend two months in the state of Odisha.

<p>100% of every dollar you lend on Kiva goes directly to funding loans. Therefore, much of Kiva's work is dependent on their volunteers and fellows, like me.

The work of Kiva Fellows is extremely important to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx6cKAW9vx8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Kiva</strong></a> as an organization. Kiva has grown to work with over 160 microfinance partners in over 60 countries, making it difficult for Kiva to be in constant contact with all of them.

<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Michigan about 10 miles outside of Detroit. Living in this area made me passionate about finding more responsible methods for urban and general economic development. To this end, I studied Public Policy in college with a concentration in Urban Development, and took time off my third year to travel and see how different cities and regions interact around the globe.</p>
<p>After graduating, I spent a year with AmeriCorps, serving at a nonprofit in the Bay Area that supports small business owners and evaluates public and private policies that drive more capital into low-income communities. <span>I am looking forward to applying the skills I've developed domestically to help support and enhance my understanding of the programs working to alliveate extreme poverty in Eastern India. Furthermore, I could not be more thrilled to be working for organizations that specifically target underserved women.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>After speaking to past fellows and others who have lived in the region, I've budgeted that the four months in India will cost about <strong>$4,400</strong>. This includes airfare, visas, accommodation, food, immunizations, and transportation to visit borrowers, among other costs.</p>
<p>The AmeriCorps program I've just completed is not designed to leave its participants with a significant savings and as such, I have limited finances to support myself during the Kiva Fellowship. However, I believe the experience I will gain is worth a significant investment on my part. For this reason, I will be using my savings to purchase my first plane ticket and the necessary vaccinations before I go. However, I am not able to pay for the rest of the program without your help. Any contributions to this page over the fundraising goal, if not used for emergency or unseen expenses in the field, will be donated back to Kiva.</p>

</p><p>UPDATE:  Illness and injury have set me back a bit over the last few weeks, and we are obviously quite far from goal.  I intend to give this another shot in a month or two.</p><p><br/></p><p>I began working in retail in 2000, I’ve been a clerk,
cashier, lead, buyer, assistant manager, and I’ve aided in business
expansion.  Retail suits me well, not
just because I enjoy tedious tasks and organization, but because I love
interacting with people.  A lot of
consumers just do their thing; they browse/buy and go about their day.  But some customers share themselves.  I get to hear about new jobs, new love,
performances and hobbies, sadness and frustration.  It’s really amazing how many lives you
connect with over a new shirt and a cash register.</p>
<p>This brings me to what I don’t like about retail: Size
Segregation.  The vast majority of
boutiques are size specific, some cater to “standard” sizing (Extra Small- Large/Extra
Large) and some cater to “plus” sizing (1XL+). 
They may carry one or two options just outside their normal size range,
but there are nearly no boutiques that offer women of all sizes a choice to
shop indiscriminately.  This, to me, is
absurd.  Women come in all sorts of
shapes and sizes, so it stands to reason that <i>all</i> women are Woman Sized, and should therefore be able to find
clothing that fits (and looks good!) wherever they choose to shop.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about fashion; it’s about self-esteem and
self-love.  Close your eyes and imagine a
world where we aren’t obsessed with our bodies, where we see the beauty in
ourselves and each other. Size segregation needs to become a thing of the past,
and that change can start here with the support and encouragement of people
like you.  Audacious Boutique is going to
be a female focused, alternative fashion boutique, exclusively carrying sizes
XS-4XL, with special orders available for customers who require a more expansive
size range.  Every purchase comes with a
high-five, hug, or both!</p>
<p>When you contribute to Audacious Boutique you’re
contributing to the belief that all women are beautiful.  You’re offering women new opportunities to
love the body they inhabit.  Every day I
hear self-shaming statements fall out of the mouths of women who don’t see how
truly amazing they are.  I can see the
defeat in their eyes when that gorgeous dress or those jeans you've been
coveting don’t quite fit.  That look
breaks my heart every time.  Your
contribution will help transform these looks of self-loathing into looks of
confidence and empowerment.</p>
<p>Along with adding smiles to the faces of beautiful women
(and the people who love them), your contribution will also provide at least
one additional person with a job, ‘cause I’m going to need help!  Audacious will also offer products on
consignment so you’ll be helping local creators and artists with opportunities
to sell their work.  </p>
<p>My goal is to open the store with as little debt
as possible so that I will be able to focus on the growth of the business and
put revenue back into the boutique rather than giving it back to a bank.  Funding from this campaign can assist me with
that goal as contributions will be used toward rental/leasing fees,
painting/flooring/etc. (if needed), store furnishings, merchandise, and ad
space.  It will also allow me to hire
folks to assist me with getting things all set up.  Yay for jobs!</p>
<p>If the support of you lovely people results in more funding
than I’ve sought out, I will donate 25% of the additional funds to Dress for
Success, which is an organization that empowers underprivileged women by
providing them with clothing, teaching them job skills, and helping them find
and maintain employment<b>.  </b>I’ll put the rest back into the business.  As someone who is currently working two
part-time retail jobs, I understand how difficult it can be to get by on
varying hours and minimum wage.  I intend
to offer those I employ a wage that would satisfy me as an employee, rather
than the lowest wage required by law.  I
want to show my appreciation for the future Audacious Boutique family, and
additional funds would go a long way with bonuses, paid time off and possibly
insurance that includes alternative health care.</p>
<p>Any and all contributions are so incredibly
appreciated.  There are a variety of
perks available; some are similar because I wanted to offer options.  They’re named after terms that could be used
to describe various women in a positive light. 
They involve thanks, high-fives, buttons, stickers, shirts, immortality
(in the form of your name or favorite quote posted in the store).  For folks living in Portland, Oregon (or who
like to visit) there are also discounts, a store mannequin could be molded
after your body, and there will be an exclusive grand opening party where you
can be one of the first to shop with a discount!</p>

<p>This is an opportunity to help change the way
women view themselves.  So much of our

size.  This is an opportunity to promote
love.</p>

<p><b>Our Situation and Why We Need You</b></p>
<p>We have a tremendous idea...and a sticky situation. Starting in January of 2015, our FirstHand team will be working and taking a special class in Cincinnati, which is home to one the fastest growing entrepreneurial communities in the country. This is the prize for winning at Miami University's Startup Weekend in October of 2014. When we are in Cincinnati, we will have access to the <b>best experts and mentors</b> in the Midwest...but <b>not</b> <b>to funding</b>.</p>
<p>Our crowd funding efforts are important here because we need the initial capital to get this operation up and running. We want to have a functioning business already running and then ask professional investors for their capital (in order to take FirstHand to the next level) instead of asking for their money to test an idea. We want to test this idea with crowd funding while we have Cincinnati's entrepreneurial community as a consulting resource. So how did we get here and how will we test our idea? Check it out!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Our Story and What FirstHand is All About</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When we (Tom and Christian) interned this summer in San Francisco, we traveled a lot and were fortunate to have a few friends in the city take us around. They showed us cool places to go shopping, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Mom 'N Pop delis with delicious sandwiches, lively public parks, and even told us funny personal stories. They brought us into their world. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It was an incredible experience! We didn't stick out. We didn't feel an ounce of anxiety. </span></p>
<p>We felt like we had lived there for years...like locals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>    <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">                 </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">   </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/981958/files/20141103051634-Screen_Shot_2014-11-03_at_8.16.13_AM.png?1415020594"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p> </p> <p> </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We want to make that same experience possible for you... anytime...anywhere, whether you know friends in a city or not. We want to build a service that allows a traveler at any time to take out their phone, pick their local, pick the places they want to go and the activities they want to do, and then meet their local minutes later and do those things!</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through hard work and determination, two Midwestern guys like us built FirstHand from an idea we had while walking around San </span>Francisco into a business model and a team! We took the idea to<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Miami University's Startup Weekend in October of 2014. While there, we met four more talented and motivated students who believe in FirstHand and want to make it a reality! Now, the FirstHand team is up to six! After about 60 hours of intense work, the creation of a business model, and a formal pitch to successful </span>entrepreneurs<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and venture capitalists, FirstHand triumphed at Startup Weekend! </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>How We Will Test It</b></span></p>
<p>The video above represents the long-term vision for FirstHand. But in order to build it up to that point, we need to start small and be wise with the limited resources we have. The best way to do this is to solve a problem our team is familiar with: university tours. </p>
<p>Parents and students are basing the decision for their child's university partly on their impression from official tours. As students ourselves, we can tell you these tours are deceptive (Disneyland versions of universities) and can potentially lead families and students to make the wrong choice of college, have their child be miserable at a school, and waste thousands of dollars. </p>
<p>In the first few months, we want to make a website that can process payments, we want to recruit college students at select universities, and we want to reach out to families of high school seniors. We will register the college students on our website and will allow the families to choose their own personal student guide who will show them around campus and give these families the real scoop on the university, both positive and negative. Families will be able to filter their guide based on their child's interests. For example, if their child is interested in Greek life and majoring in marketing, they will be able to filter through potential guides to find a marketing major who is also a member of a Greek organization. </p>
<p>Payments will be made in advance of the tour and processed through the website. We can achieve this within the next few months and begin operations. With good results, we will be able to confidently go in front of investors with a proven model and pitch the next step: the mobile app, big city neighborhoods, and on-demand city locals. </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your Impact</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Contributors will help us develop a website with a clean user interface and payment processing capabilities. We want to do this right the first time, and you can help us! </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">From our own experiences and our research, we know that people want authenticity. People want what's real. People want to be able to customize experiences to get the most for their money. With our long-term vision, you will be able to experience new places in a much deeper and more authentic way. </span></p>

<p>Thanks for the support!</p>
<p>* We would like to thank Entrepreneur, John Altman, for giving us the opportunity to live and work in Silicon Valley this past summer. Without your generosity, none of this would be possible. Thank you for changing our lives. </p>
<p> - Tom and Christian</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div></div>","Our Situation and Why We Need You
We have a tremendous idea...and a sticky situation. Starting in January of 2015, our FirstHand team will be working and taking a special class in Cincinnati, which is home to one the fastest growing entrepreneurial communities in the country. This is the prize for winning at Miami University's Startup Weekend in October of 2014. When we are in Cincinnati, we will have access to the best experts and mentors in the Midwest...but not to funding.
Our crowd funding efforts are important here because we need the initial capital to get this operation up and running. We want to have a functioning business already running and then ask professional investors for their capital (in order to take FirstHand to the next level) instead of asking for their money to test an idea. We want to test this idea with crowd funding while we have Cincinnati's entrepreneurial community as a consulting resource. So how did we get here and how will we test our idea? Check it out!
 
Our Story and What FirstHand is All About
When we (Tom and Christian) interned this summer in San Francisco, we traveled a lot and were fortunate to have a few friends in the city take us around. They showed us cool places to go shopping, Mom 'N Pop delis with delicious sandwiches, lively public parks, and even told us funny personal stories. They brought us into their world. It was an incredible experience! We didn't stick out. We didn't feel an ounce of anxiety. 
We felt like we had lived there for years...like locals. 
 
                        
   
We want to make that same experience possible for you... anytime...anywhere, whether you know friends in a city or not. We want to build a service that allows a traveler at any time to take out their phone, pick their local, pick the places they want to go and the activities they want to do, and then meet their local minutes later and do those things!
Through hard work and determination, two Midwestern guys like us built FirstHand from an idea we had while walking around San Francisco into a business model and a team! We took the idea to Miami University's Startup Weekend in October of 2014. While there, we met four more talented and motivated students who believe in FirstHand and want to make it a reality! Now, the FirstHand team is up to six! After about 60 hours of intense work, the creation of a business model, and a formal pitch to successful entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, FirstHand triumphed at Startup Weekend! 
 
How We Will Test It
The video above represents the long-term vision for FirstHand. But in order to build it up to that point, we need to start small and be wise with the limited resources we have. The best way to do this is to solve a problem our team is familiar with: university tours. 
Parents and students are basing the decision for their child's university partly on their impression from official tours. As students ourselves, we can tell you these tours are deceptive (Disneyland versions of universities) and can potentially lead families and students to make the wrong choice of college, have their child be miserable at a school, and waste thousands of dollars. 
In the first few months, we want to make a website that can process payments, we want to recruit college students at select universities, and we want to reach out to families of high school seniors. We will register the college students on our website and will allow the families to choose their own personal student guide who will show them around campus and give these families the real scoop on the university, both positive and negative. Families will be able to filter their guide based on their child's interests. For example, if their child is interested in Greek life and majoring in marketing, they will be able to filter through potential guides to find a marketing major who is also a member of a Greek organization. 
Payments will be made in advance of the tour and processed through the website. We can achieve this within the next few months and begin operations. With good results, we will be able to confidently go in front of investors with a proven model and pitch the next step: the mobile app, big city neighborhoods, and on-demand city locals. 
Your Impact

Contributors will help us develop a website with a clean user interface and payment processing capabilities. We want to do this right the first time, and you can help us! 
From our own experiences and our research, we know that people want authenticity. People want what's real. People want to be able to customize experiences to get the most for their money. With our long-term vision, you will be able to experience new places in a much deeper and more authentic way. 
With what FirstHand can become, you will no longer have to book pre-set tours and be limited to their schedules. You will no longer have to be stuck with a guide you don't care for. You will no longer have to suffer through an entire tour when you don't want to.
FirstHand will be an on-demand service--customizable and personal. It's an incredible tool to connect the world, break down cultural barriers, and make traveling less stressful! 
  What We NeedWe need $25,000 in funding. We can get a website created for $10,000, and the rest we will use for advertising, promotion, and for unexpected roadblocks. Funding also goes toward robust background checks on the college students. We will do everything we can to ensure our customers are safe. Our biggest challenge is simply time. We are in a race against time...chasing our dream. We have a small window to accomplish our goal. But we can do it with your help!If we don't reach the funding goal, whatever we do raise will go first into making the website, and whatever is left will, again, be put into background checks and marketing. We will get as far as possible! We're working extremely hard to make this happen, and we love it! Nothing will be wasted. What matters most to us is making a great service that people will love.

<p>We want to put 100 <i>Cyclo Bicis</i> rolling in neighborhoods with limited material resources and few recreational spaces for children in Cali. </p>
<p>We will manufacture and donate 100 <b><i>Cyclo Bicis</i></b> to children between 2 and 5 years old in Cali, Colombia, whose families are poor. We want to foster the use of the bicycle from an early age and stimulate their development and learning capacity through play.</p>
<p>It’s scientifically proven that physical exercise has beneficial effects on brain function, such as promoting neuroplasticity and improve performance of learning and memory, and improve interaction with others and the physical and social environmental function. </p>
<p>For <b><i>Cyclo, Innovating, Development and Learning</i></b> the donation of these 100 <b><i>Cyclo Bicis</i></b> will impact our immediate environment which is Cali, since from the early years of life we are promoting the use of bicycles as a system of transportation that is sustainable, fun, and healthy for everyone.</p>
<p>Besides the physical activity and the feeling of freedom it gives, the <b><i>Cyclo Bicis</i></b> help strengthen family bonds. We wish to strengthen, through play and fun, family unity and social structure in the communities, along with the development and growth of the children benefited.</p>
<h3>How far have we advanced until now with the Cyclo Bicis Project </h3>
<p>After a research and experimentation process that began in early 2013, we invited family and friends to share their skills and funds necessary for the production of the first 23 Cyclo bikes; 8 were made for our Cyclo family and the rest were given to 15 children from different neighborhoods in the cities of Cali and Palmira, in the Valle del Cauca.<b><i> So we made it! ... Today Cyclo is for our sons and daughters and other children of our city, finally a reality! </i></b></p>

Mientras los niños y niñas beneficiarias del
proyecto Cyclo Bicis se divierten y sonríen, desarrollan sus destrezas físicas
incrementando su fuerza, agilidad y autoconfianza. ¡Tu contribución lo hace posible!



Queremos poner a rodar 100 Cyclo Bicis en barrios de recursos materiales limitados y pocos espacios de recreación para niños y niñas de Cali.
Vamos a fabricar y donar 100 Cyclo Bicis a los niños y niñas entre los 2 y los 5 años de edad de la ciudad de Cali, Colombia, cuyas familias son de escasos recursos. Queremos fomentar el uso de la bicicleta desde una edad temprana y estimular su desarrollo y aprendizaje a través del juego. Esta comprobado cientificamente que el ejercicio físico posee efectos beneficiosos sobre la función cerebral, tales como promover la neuroplasticidad y aumentar el rendimiento del aprendizaje y la memoria, además de mejorar la interacción con otros y con el ambiente físico y social.Para Cyclo, Innovación, Desarrollo y Aprendizaje la donación de estas 100 Cyclo Bicis tendrá un impacto en nuestro entorno inmediato que es Cali ya que desde los primeros años de vida estamos promoviendo el uso de la bicicleta como un sistema de transporte sustentable, alegre y saludable para todos.Además de la actividad física y la sensación de libertad, las Cyclo Bicis ayudan a fortalecer las relaciones familiares. Queremos fortalecer a través del juego y la diversión, la unión familiar y el tejido social de las comunidades, acompañando el desarrollo y crecimiento de los niños y niñas beneficiarias. Cuánto hemos avanzado hasta ahora con el proyecto Cyclo BicisDespués de un proceso de investigación y experimentación que inició a principios del año 2013, invitamos a la familia, a los amigos y amigas para compartir sus habilidades y los fondos necesarios para la producción de las primeras 23 Cyclo Bicis: 8 se hicieron para nuestra familia Cyclo y las restantes se entregaron a 15 niños y niñas de diferentes barrios de las ciudades de Cali y Palmira, en el Valle del Cauca. Así que lo conseguimos!…hoy Cyclo es para nuestros hijos, hijas y otros niños y niñas de nuestra ciudad, una realidad!  Mapa de Georeferenciación de los niños beneficiariosEste mapa muestra la distribución de las 23 Cyclo Bicis entregadas hasta ahora. Da click aqui Mapa de Georefenciacion, para ver el mapa completo.Cómo funciona la entrega de las Cyclo BicisCyclo, Innovación, Desarrollo y Aprendizaje junto con organizaciones comunitarias que trabajan por el bienestar de la primera infancia en diferentes sectores de limitados recursos de Cali, selecciona a los niños y niñas beneficiarios.Estos niños y niñas tienen la posibilidad de quedarse con la bicicleta de aprendizaje hasta que hayan crecido lo suficiente o hasta que puedan montar una bicicleta con pedales. Las bicicletas regresan al proyecto, se les hace un mantenimiento y están listas para ser utilizadas nuevamente. Y así se inicia nuevamente el Ciclo.Para acompañar a los niños, niñas y a sus familias en el proceso con las Cyclo Bicis, se organizan encuentros con regularidad. Estos encuentros son apoyados por profesionales voluntarios en educación física y salud, que ayudan con la organización de actividades lúdico recreativas y de integración.Lo que necesitamos Nuestra meta es fabricar 100 Cyclo Bicis y para ello necesitamos USD $22.000. Cada dólar que inviertes en la campaña estará destinado a las siguientes actividades:Producción de las 100 Cyclo Bicis: Compra de todos los materiales, principalmente madera de alta calidad para asegurar su estabilidad y durabilidad; esto incluye la mano de obra, tanto la administrativa como la operativa.Entrega de las 100 Cyclo Bicis: Las 100 Cyclo Bicis serán entregadas en un evento especial, en el que participan voluntarios recreacionistas, educadores físicos, fisioterapeutas, artistas y un staff de producción que ayudarán con la organización de actividades lúdico recreativas para los niños, niñas y sus acompañantes.

100 CYCLO BICIS AND THOUSANDS OF TENDER SMILESWhile boys and girls benefiting of the Project Cyclo Bicis have fun and smile, they develop their physical skills by increasing their strength, agility and confidence. Your contribution makes it possible! 

We want to put 100 Cyclo Bicis rolling in neighborhoods with limited material resources and few recreational spaces for children in Cali. 
We will manufacture and donate 100 Cyclo Bicis to children between 2 and 5 years old in Cali, Colombia, whose families are poor. We want to foster the use of the bicycle from an early age and stimulate their development and learning capacity through play.
It’s scientifically proven that physical exercise has beneficial effects on brain function, such as promoting neuroplasticity and improve performance of learning and memory, and improve interaction with others and the physical and social environmental function. 
For Cyclo, Innovating, Development and Learning the donation of these 100 Cyclo Bicis will impact our immediate environment which is Cali, since from the early years of life we are promoting the use of bicycles as a system of transportation that is sustainable, fun, and healthy for everyone.
Besides the physical activity and the feeling of freedom it gives, the Cyclo Bicis help strengthen family bonds. We wish to strengthen, through play and fun, family unity and social structure in the communities, along with the development and growth of the children benefited.
How far have we advanced until now with the Cyclo Bicis Project 
After a research and experimentation process that began in early 2013, we invited family and friends to share their skills and funds necessary for the production of the first 23 Cyclo bikes; 8 were made for our Cyclo family and the rest were given to 15 children from different neighborhoods in the cities of Cali and Palmira, in the Valle del Cauca. So we made it! ... Today Cyclo is for our sons and daughters and other children of our city, finally a reality!

<h2><b>The
Project </b></h2>
<p>My name is Christine Chen
and I am a current student at Stanford University. I am traveling to
Ghana this summer to create an <b>audio documentary on the current and
future dimensions of orphan care</b>. While there, I will conduct in-depth
interviews with individuals leading the way in driving nationwide orphan care
reform efforts. These stories will be synthesized into
a professional, 20-25 minute audio piece, which will be broadcast on the
Stanford public radio station (KZSU) and available online through the Stanford
Storytelling Project.</p>
<p>Service has always been a large part of my life. This project arose from a <b>personal realization</b> that we need to better understand
the effects of our desire to ""make a difference""
in other countries. Even the best intentions can do more harm than good if they are not clearly aligned with a community's needs. In this case, supporting orphanages in Ghana seems like a noble cause, but in reality ends up perpetuating a corrupt and harmful system that fails to meet the needs of the children. </p>
<h4><b><i>That is why this project is so important to me. </i></b></h4>
<p>
</p><p>It is a way to raise awareness about this sensitive and complex issue—but more importantly, to do so through the voices of those who've witnessed the
problem firsthand. People like <b>Madam Helena Obeng-Asamoah</b>, Acting Director of the
Department of Children at the Ministry, who's led Ghana's efforts in
orphanage reform since the early 2000's; or Mrs. <b>Adwoa Yeboah-Marfo</b>,
founder of the Marfo Children Care Foundation, who's dedicated her life to providing
a caring family environment in Ghana for orphaned children.</p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span><p></p>
<p>This audio documentary will be carried upon<b> <i>their</i> voices. </b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b></b></span></p>
<p><b>Help make this initiative possible. </b>With your
support, we can bring a more robust awareness to this  issue, and encourage people everywhere to more critically examine the ways they
choose to make a difference.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>
</h3><h2><b>How can you help?</b></h2>
<p>I recently received the Stanford Braden Grant in partial support of this project; however, the grant does not cover the<b> </b>cost of living expenses for the duration of this project. I will be living in Ghana for two months, and then near Stanford, CA for the final month of creating this documentary. <b>All funds will go towards paying for these</b> <b>3 months of housing</b>. </p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>Housing cost in Ghana (2 months):
     $1,200</li>
<li>Housing cost while back in
     the US (1 month): $1,200</li>
<li>TOTAL: $2,400</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h4>I would appreciate any
amount you can give towards this overall goal.<b> </b>
</h4><p>Your support helps make this project and vision possible.</p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3>
<h2><b>Why is this issue important? </b></h2>
<p>In Ghana, orphan care is

<p></p></div>","The
Project 
My name is Christine Chen
and I am a current student at Stanford University. I am traveling to
Ghana this summer to create an audio documentary on the current and
future dimensions of orphan care. While there, I will conduct in-depth
interviews with individuals leading the way in driving nationwide orphan care
reform efforts. These stories will be synthesized into
a professional, 20-25 minute audio piece, which will be broadcast on the
Stanford public radio station (KZSU) and available online through the Stanford
Storytelling Project.
Service has always been a large part of my life. This project arose from a personal realization that we need to better understand
the effects of our desire to ""make a difference""
in other countries. Even the best intentions can do more harm than good if they are not clearly aligned with a community's needs. In this case, supporting orphanages in Ghana seems like a noble cause, but in reality ends up perpetuating a corrupt and harmful system that fails to meet the needs of the children. 
That is why this project is so important to me. 

It is a way to raise awareness about this sensitive and complex issue—but more importantly, to do so through the voices of those who've witnessed the
problem firsthand. People like Madam Helena Obeng-Asamoah, Acting Director of the
Department of Children at the Ministry, who's led Ghana's efforts in
orphanage reform since the early 2000's; or Mrs. Adwoa Yeboah-Marfo,
founder of the Marfo Children Care Foundation, who's dedicated her life to providing
a caring family environment in Ghana for orphaned children.

This audio documentary will be carried upon their voices. 

Help make this initiative possible. With your
support, we can bring a more robust awareness to this  issue, and encourage people everywhere to more critically examine the ways they
choose to make a difference.

How can you help?
I recently received the Stanford Braden Grant in partial support of this project; however, the grant does not cover the cost of living expenses for the duration of this project. I will be living in Ghana for two months, and then near Stanford, CA for the final month of creating this documentary. All funds will go towards paying for these 3 months of housing. 

Housing cost in Ghana (2 months):
     $1,200
Housing cost while back in
     the US (1 month): $1,200
TOTAL: $2,400

I would appreciate any
amount you can give towards this overall goal. 
Your support helps make this project and vision possible.
Why is this issue important? 
In Ghana, orphan care is
a critically important issue.  At best, institutional care through facilities like orphanages is highly detrimental to child welfare and development, even while operating at the highest possible standards. This, coupled with the lack of continuity of care, emotional support, and training for independence outside of the orphanage put these children at a significant disadvantage (Williamson, 2010). At worst, orphanages operate illegally, taking advantage of the system—and children—to
generate a profit (IRIN, 2009). Facilities engage in ""orphan tourism,"" imposing poor living conditions on
their children as a way to solicit donations from sympathetic Western donors. (Frimpong-Manso, 2013). In spite of this, there continues to be ongoing support of orphanages from foreign donors, who pledge money or resources to support existing orphanages, or to found new ones.   While there is no simple solution to this problem, a more meaningful
long-term approach, which has been
spearheaded by the Ghanaian Department of Social Welfare, is to support family-based care. This involves reunifying children with family members
and empowering communities to support cohesive family units. In 2006, the
Ghanaian government enacted the Care Reform Initiative, a nationwide effort to
move children out of orphanages and back to immediate or extended families. Beyond mere reunification, they also aim to re-purpose orphanages into schools, community centers, and women shelters, which will contribute towards supporting the community itself (Ghanaian DSW). The
momentum of this movement, coupled with the growing realization of the
non-sustainability of orphanages, has contributed to a growing push to
better meet the needs of Ghana’s most vulnerable children. This
is the current state of affairs in Ghana, and it holds immense potential
for changing the way orphaned children are cared for now and in the future.

<p>Truly, we need $4 million dollars
- it takes a lot of money to buy, renovate, and stock a grocery store.  In the first phase we are trying to raise $1 million from the community.  $1
million is the minimum needed to secure financing for the purchase of the building.  So far, we have raised $680,000 and that
number keeps rising, but we need it to accelerate. </p>

Through this Indiegogo campaign we’re trying to raise at least $50,000,
with a reach goal of $150,000.  An influx of cash at this level would be a
huge boost in our efforts – and go a long way to convincing other potential
donors that this project is going to succeed. 
Money raised from this campaign will be used for the purchase of the
30,000 sq. ft. building.  Upon purchase, the building will then be cleaned
up, built out, and reopened in the second phase of the project.</div>

<p>This project is community
grown.  Our board of directors is made up
of dedicated community volunteers – the only benefit we stand to gain from this
project is a functioning grocery store. 
100% of your donations go towards opening Clifton Market.  We are dedicated to putting the groceries back into the grocery store.</p>
<p>We’ve already raised $680,000+
and have 885+ owners – proving both a strong community commitment to the
project and trust in its leadership and overall viability.</p>

<p>All large undertakings come with
risk - this community owned grocery being no different.  Funding is our
largest hurdle.  We are confident that the store will be successful once
opened (and we have an in-depth 3<sup>rd</sup> party market survey on our
website that adds reassurance), but we have to buy, build out, and stock the
grocery first, which represents a large investment.  Your participation in
this Indiegogo campaign will help lower this financial hurdle.</p>

<p><b>Q: Why a Co-op?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The co-op business model is the fastest and easiest way to raise money.
Grocery co-ops source more local food, pay better wages, and put more money
back into the local economy. Profits from the co-op are returned to owners in
the community in the form of patronage dividends. This encourages owner loyalty
because the more you shop, the more you get back.</p>
<p><b>Q: How will this store succeed when Keller’s didn’t?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b>Keller’s IGA was
turning a profit even in its last year of operation, but profits were being
used to support another store and the store needed renovations and modern
marketing. Market analysis indicates that an uptrend grocery would bring in
more money than the conventional model that Keller’s followed. Clifton Market
will be an uptrend grocery.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can an independent store like Clifton Market be
competitive?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Co-ops have exclusive distribution channels to get organic and quality
foods at competitive prices. We also plan to use local products not only for
quality but to reduce shipping costs. We plan to have a wide variety of
products to serve all shoppers who live or work in the area.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the status of negotiations?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>We have a contract to purchase 319 Ludlow and are
currently working on raising funds through owner loans to complete the purchase.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the condition of the former IGA?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The building is considered to be “White Box” ready by
commercial real-estate standards. It is structurally sound and ready for
cosmetic upgrades. It has a new roof, asbestos was abated, and flooring issues
have been fixed.</p>
<p><b>Q: How much will the project cost?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The cost of the building is $1.65 million, which will give us a clear
title. We will need another $2.9 million for construction, equipment and
fixtures, initial inventory, and operating expenses. The building was appraised
at over $2 million, so we are getting a bargain.</p>
<p><b>Q: How will we raise the funds?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> We are raising funds
through shares and owner loans. When we secure half the financing from the
community, we will approach banks and other institutions for conventional
loans. Distributors have offered rebatable loans and free first inventory worth
up to $500,000. We are also pursuing gifts and donations from large
institutions interested in promoting the health and well being of Clifton
residents.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I buy a share?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Purchase online,
visit us during our office hours, or download the owner share application and
mail it with a check to:</p>
<p>Clifton Market</p>
<p>PO Box 20162</p>
<p>Cincinnati,
OH 45220</p>
<p><b>Q: When will the store open?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Once we have
purchased the building, we can set the final schedule, but we expect the store
will be open for summer 2015. The sooner we raise the necessary funds, the
sooner the store will open.</p>
<p><b>Q: What does uptrend and full-service mean?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Uptrend describes the look and feel of the grocery store - a more polished look than conventional stores (think Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s).   Full-service means that the store sells fresh fruts and vegetables, fresh meats, poultry, and sea food, dairy products, canned foods, frozen foods, dry groceries and baked goods and non-alcoholic beverages.<br/></p>

</div></div>","We’re developing a cooperatively owned grocery store with a focus on local and organic food at competitive prices. The front and back of our T-shirts!    Our canvas tote bags!                                 And our bibs!If you would like to find out more the naming rights for our aisles, alley, shopping carts, etc.  please send an email to info@cliftonmarket.comClifton, a neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, lost its only grocery in 2011 when Keller’s IGA closed.  Keller’s had faithfully served the community for over 70 years, serving as both a social hub to the community and an anchor to the business district.  The Keller’s IGA was still turning a profit in its final year, but due to issues in their second store, deferred maintenance, and unpaid taxes it was forced to close.  The store served as a social hub to the community and an anchor to the business district, but it has now been vacant for three and a half years, hurting both businesses and residents alike.After numerous courtships with
larger grocery chains, a change of ownership and promise of a new IGA, the
building still sits vacant.  As a
community we cannot wait anymore for someone else to fill the space. As a
community we can create the grocery store that our neighborhood needs.The Clifton Market is incorporated as a cooperative business with the State of Ohio -it will function like a traditional grocery store, but is owned by the community (and beyond).  Owner shares in Clifton Market cannot be sold via Indiegogo, but check out our website to learn more: cliftonmarket.comThe cooperative owners will vote each year for the board of
directors.  The board will govern the
grocery store and hire a store manager to operate and manage the store.
Our shelves will be stocked
with as much local and organic products as we can source, while also stocking conventional grocery items at competitive prices.  We will have a mouth watering produce department, a full service butcher and seafood department, a Euro bakery, a deli with prepared foods and salad bar, extensive beer and wine selection, international foods as well as everyday products.




 






Truly, we need $4 million dollars
- it takes a lot of money to buy, renovate, and stock a grocery store.  In the first phase we are trying to raise $1 million from the community.  $1
million is the minimum needed to secure financing for the purchase of the building.  So far, we have raised $680,000 and that
number keeps rising, but we need it to accelerate. 

Through this Indiegogo campaign we’re trying to raise at least $50,000,
with a reach goal of $150,000.  An influx of cash at this level would be a
huge boost in our efforts – and go a long way to convincing other potential
donors that this project is going to succeed. 
Money raised from this campaign will be used for the purchase of the
30,000 sq. ft. building.  Upon purchase, the building will then be cleaned
up, built out, and reopened in the second phase of the project.







The return of a local, community-based grocery
store. 

Bringing 15,000 customers weekly to the Ludlow Business District

Local farmers and food producers, as we plan to stock
a large array of local food.


The preservation of an urban business district that
relies on the grocery store to generate the necessary foot traffic for
business.


Livable wages for employees.





When is the last time you were
given the opportunity to help open a grocery store? Support us today!  And check out our
website at cliftonmarket.com





This project is community
grown.  Our board of directors is made up
of dedicated community volunteers – the only benefit we stand to gain from this
project is a functioning grocery store. 
100% of your donations go towards opening Clifton Market.  We are dedicated to putting the groceries back into the grocery store.
We’ve already raised $680,000+
and have 885+ owners – proving both a strong community commitment to the
project and trust in its leadership and overall viability.


We have a diverse team working on
this project, with over 50 years of combined grocery experience and over 50
years of combined marketing experience.  Our board has members who are 5th generation
Clifton residents and members across a diverse age, gender, and race
groups.  We have positioned ourselves for success, and you can help.



All large undertakings come with
risk - this community owned grocery being no different.  Funding is our
largest hurdle.  We are confident that the store will be successful once
opened (and we have an in-depth 3rd party market survey on our
website that adds reassurance), but we have to buy, build out, and stock the
grocery first, which represents a large investment.  Your participation in
this Indiegogo campaign will help lower this financial hurdle.
If you would like to participate
by volunteering or becoming a share owner, check out our website at

your friends on social media.  Like us on Facebook!

UNCG quidditch was founded in Fall 2010 as an intramural (campus only) sport. By the next year, we had become a fully recognized club sport, which means we compete with teams across the state and country. Last year was the first year we went to the Mid-Atlantic Regional Competition (Sponsored by the International Quidditch Association). We are planning on going again this year, but one important thing has changed: It is now much farther away. In order to go, we have to get a hotel for two nights for the whole team (21 players) and we are planning on renting a bus with our friends from Appalachian State Quidditch. The bus alone will cost over $3000 (our half is $1500) and the hotel will cost at least $500. So we need your help! Look to the side of the screen for all of the awesome perks you get when you donate, and watch the video above for an example of our extreme awkwardness and lovableness. Also donate! (please)

campaign. By giving us 6 minutes of your time today, we hope you’ve realized
the potential Atlantis Niagara has for growth and continued excellence in the
competitive Icewine/agritourism industry in Niagara.
With your help, Atlantis Niagara can
become synonymous with Niagara Tourism. The remarkable experience combined with
the finest and most complex Icewines, is an experience ever sought out in
Niagara, but never fully realized. Now, you can be a part of it.
As we mentioned in the video, Atlantis
Niagara is the accumulation of over 200 years of experience, 7 million dollars
of our own capital, and countless hours of hard work. 


Through all of this, we have not
  sacrificed the quality of our wines and the excruciatingly complex means in
  which we produce them. This unique method of crafting ultra-premium Icewine
  has been passed down by generations of the Kocsis family.


What we hope to include now, is an
experience you will never forget. The demand in Niagara for unique experiences
is as high as ever. Approximately 12 million people visit the Niagara region
each year.
While thrill seekers of every age flock
here in search of their next story, there is a definite shortage of attractions
suited to their wants.
Besides, one highly priced helicopter Tour
Company and a couple of boat tours, Niagara has few attractions for the
adventure seeker.
Until now. Until Atlantis Niagara.




We plan to bring
  the first, and ONLY hovercraft tour to Niagara. 
The Hovercraft
  can hold 25 passengers (perfect for an office party), can travel smoothly
  across land and sea (imagine whipping through a vineyard, then out on to Lake
  Ontario for an exciting 20 minute tour with 360 degree spins), and is fully
  operational year round! Even through the chilling winters of Niagara that
  make our Icewine so special.

On top of all of this, we want to offer
helicopter and power boat tours. Atlantis Niagara will be your one-stop tourist
attraction. 
Something important to us at Atlantis
Niagara is that these attractions are reasonably priced to you, our valued
customer. You wont see any $200 for 20-minute prices here. At Atlantis Niagara,
we are geared more towards $50-$75 per person for a 7-minute helicopter ride as
well as a 20 minute hovercraft tour.
Powerboat tours in our 50foot turbine
powered catamaran that is capable of speeds in excess of 100 miles-per-hour
will be offered as a two-hour trip up the Niagara River and back to our winery. Afterwords, enjoy a delicious barbecued lunch and your choice of 3 tastings. This tour will be
in the $200 range, but is considered a half day tour…and allows you to
become an official member of the Atlantis Niagara 100MPH Club !....a very
exclusive club indeed!This will allow you to experience more of
the amenities while still being budget conscious.
A 7-minute helicopter ride still allows
plenty of time to explore the escarpment of Niagara, and offer great picture
& video opportunities (perfect for couples, photographers, and filmmakers).

Between the exuberant amounts of fun you
will be having with our attractions, you will also be able to sip on and enjoy
our handcrafted, ultra-premium Icewine.
Ahhh the Icewine, what really makes
Atlantis Niagara special. 





The
  amount of commitment and dedication that Atlantis Niagara winemaker/owner
  John Kocsis takes to craft each bottle can really only be described after you
  taste one of his Icewines.

Hailed by wine writers as Icewines
unlike anything they have ever tasted before, John’s complex Icewines are something every
person should try once in their lifetime.
If you don’t believe how unique and
special his Icewines are, just ask to taste the small lot Vidal, Riesling blend
he has concocted that fermented outside in minus 20 degree (Celsius) weather!

It has a new Engine, new transmission, new wiring(in process), Windshield, Stereo, wheels and tires, and the iconic paint job. With all of this we have already spent several thousands of dollars to make this dream come true. </p>
<p>But we need your help to finish it. we want to completely rebuild the inside, so we can give people rides in it. The ultimate goal is to be able to take kids who are sick for rides in the amazing Mystery Inc van. </p>
<p>We have pulled out the interior including all the wall panels. which will be replaced with brand new ones with themed  artistic murals by local artists for everyone to enjoy for years to come.</p>
<p>the interior will include two bench seats forming a L shape in the back, shag carpet, lights, specialty seating for sick kids, new seat covers for the front, a special dash cover, a horn that plays Scooby Doo's laugh a exterior speaker covered by a custom built prop cover that looks like the iconic spare tire in the cartoon. this speaker will be used for playing music and annoucements  at the events we attend. </p>

<p>Full Society is a socially conscious and sustainable company. We want to cut down on paper receipts (who wants to keep track of those anyway?) and change the way we think about society. </p>
<p>Our app is focused on giving back to the community, a desire that many of us have as our society becomes more interconnected. The social media integration also generates positive personal promotion for the users (and restaurants) among their peers. Our goal is to be a social enterprise that attempts to bridge gaps in society through business solutions.</p>

class at Johns Hopkins. Having waited tables and bar-tended in crowded
restaurants in the past, Paige (founder) saw a dire need for ways in which
restaurants could save time. After writing a 40 page research paper on industry
trends and analysis, creating user surveys, and conducting numerous interviews
with restaurant owners, she put together a team and went straight to work
developing the product. Paige is a Johns Hopkins University graduate who has
worked in finance for the past 6 years. Last year she went back to grad school
to get her MBA and that’s when Full Society came about. </span>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>What would life be without a little risk? We've already experienced several challenges and we are certain there will be more to come.</p>
<p>Our biggest concern is our ability to get to market quickly. Although the mobile payments industry is still very nascent, there are many startups in addition to fully developed companies encroaching upon the space. We are still exploring options to help us quickly expand to restaurants across the country.</p>
<p>To lessen this risk, we are currently focused on forming strategic partnerships that will help us expand and scale quickly.</p>
<p>Another risk we face is delay in the technical development timeline due to additional unexpected work needed. We went through a very thorough requirements definition with Bolster Labs to ensure that this will not be likely to happen.</p>

<h3><b>More About the Team</b></h3>
<p><b>The truth? Here is how the team came to be:</b></p>
<p>Paige and Mike went to high school together. Paige knew mike was smart from taking AP calculus with him. They parted ways for college and worked in different industries but always stayed close friends. When Paige was 5, her sister Lauren was born, thus saving her from being the self-absorbed only child she otherwise most certainly would have been. During her MBA, Paige solicited Lauren’s help to learn graphic design for some of her projects. That’s when Lauren realized the potential for Full Society and encouraged her sister to move forward. They searched high and low for a free intern who was intelligent and hardworking (nearly impossible). Somehow Lauren convinced Jamie to get behind the project and move from New Jersey to Baltimore to be with us full time. Paige, Mike, Lauren, and Jamie have been together ever since.</p>

YOU are in control. No bartender or server required.The Full Society app connects you to nearby restaurants and bars. Convenient, seamless, and socially conscious: our mission is to give a meal to someone in need for every table that pays through our app.The idea of ""Full Society"" is that you feel FULL from eating out, and you feel FULL by helping provide a meal for others after paying your bill.  The result? A FULL society!""I have been waiting for someone to solve this annoying restaurant problem for years"" - Leo Khin, Chapter Director of Start Up Grind ""Full Society is the best restaurant app on the East Coast! Paige is a truly gifted entrepreneur!"" - Johns Hopkins Innovation Factory “We applaud Full Society for its vision and compassion, and we celebrate this launch!”  - Robert Gehman, Executive Director of Helping Up Mission As Featured In:(See our press page!)
In today's world, our lives are busy enough! Full Society will save you TIME when you eat out, make your dining experience MORE enjoyable, and LESS awkward (e.g. the horrors of splitting the bill between 10 friends at last call).























Click here to learn more about beacons!














Full Society is a socially conscious and sustainable company. We want to cut down on paper receipts (who wants to keep track of those anyway?) and change the way we think about society. 
Our app is focused on giving back to the community, a desire that many of us have as our society becomes more interconnected. The social media integration also generates positive personal promotion for the users (and restaurants) among their peers. Our goal is to be a social enterprise that attempts to bridge gaps in society through business solutions.





Let’s not be silly.
We don’t expect that every single American will go out to eat exactly once every 5 days and donate $1.25 every time. But, we do believe that there are a large number of people who will. Those people will have a HUGE impact!Many Americans are surprised to learn how big of a problem hunger is in our own country: 1 in 6 people in America go hungry every night.




Our Non-Profit Partners: If you choose to donate, where will the money go?
We provide meals by partnering with non-profits. In-app donations are sent to these organizations to provide meals directly to those in need.











Our Founder The initial concept for Full Society was born in a
class at Johns Hopkins. Having waited tables and bar-tended in crowded
restaurants in the past, Paige (founder) saw a dire need for ways in which
restaurants could save time. After writing a 40 page research paper on industry
trends and analysis, creating user surveys, and conducting numerous interviews
with restaurant owners, she put together a team and went straight to work
developing the product. Paige is a Johns Hopkins University graduate who has
worked in finance for the past 6 years. Last year she went back to grad school
to get her MBA and that’s when Full Society came about. 


The Founding Team includes two University of Delaware graduates (Lauren “The Lorax” Cantlin and Jamie “Jambles” Winder) and a University of Maryland graduate, Mike Klicos, also known as “Dad."" Lauren brings years of creative design and writing experience to the team, while Jamie has similar writing experience in addition to strong communications and marketing skills. And Mike, the only non-female member, brings over 15 years of restaurant experience to the team. 
We also partnered with Bolster Labs to do our
technical development and design. 


Most importantly, the entire team is deeply passionate and determined to help others. Full Society wants to take all necessary risks required to do what we believe is right for our community and beyond. We are a bootstrapped business, having just recently accepted $25k in seed funding from the Accelerate Baltimore Program. 





Awards and Competitions:

Accelerate Baltimore 2015 Winner (recipient of $25k funding)
Johns Hopkins University Business Plan Competition Finalist 2015
Invest Maryland SemiFinalist 2015
Johns Hopkins University Innovation Factory Startup Winner 2014

Traction:

2,100 interested pre-users 
Pilot program set to launch MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Summer 2015 in 25 restaurants

We are so close! We still need to finish technical development to get our MVP to launch. We also believe that marketing is key in getting user adoption at our onset and beyond. Help us spread the word about America's dire need for a society full of happy, well-fed people. When you receive, you should give back. That is what creates a Full Society!


Note that the Full Society team is a lean startup. We've made ourselves successful by making our wants few (scrounging up ramen, crackers on the floor, and anything else we can find to sustain ourselves). We are entirely unpaid working around the clock on this project.
Your funding will allow us to:

<p>""The environment"". Let's be honest...the moment a person brings up the word, we immediately start to feel bad about ourselves. ""I'm not doing enough"" and ""I should do more"" is how we feel. We start to defend our actions not because we don't want to help, but because we see the problem as too hard to fix and adding discomfort to our daily lives. In our past experiences, we've encountered too many eco-products that either don't work well, are expensive, or require too much effort with minimal results. Although that may be far from the truth now, environmentalism's reputation precedes itself and to put it bluntly...it's not seen as 'cool'.</p>

<p>The Refuture app is a simple tool that transforms all of your positive daily actions into points that are ranked against our friends on a social platform. If you walk to work rather than drive your car, you gain points. If you spend less on your electricity bill, you gain points. This allows people to track their progress, motivate themselves and their friends, and most importantly see the collective impact they have on the world as a group. We've gamified the experience. Ultimately, it makes it easier for people to do good by encouraging them to do more of what they're already doing right, rather than forcing new uncomfortable behaviours. We believe that the only way to truly take sustainability to the next level is not to go against the mainstream, but to go with it. </p>
<p>We want you to be a part of this movement of changing the face of sustainability into something new. Into something you're likely to find on your Instagram feed, not in the trunk of your hippie uncle's car.  </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>What is the Refuture app?</h4>
<p>The Refuture app is a simple tool that tracks all of your positive daily actions into points that are ranked against your friends on a social platform. It helps to create good habits and aims to keep people motivated by providing social competition and showing collective impact.  </p>
<h4>Why are you doing this?</h4>Sustainability is an issue shared by all of us, but it's only being tackled by a small group of people. That's not enough. We want to make sustainability something that normal people can smoothly incorporate in their lives every day, not just the people already living green. We believe people do have the desire to help - they just find it difficult to do so. So we're planting the first seeds for a bigger movement.  </div><div><h4>How are you different?</h4></div><div>We're not the first to gamify sustainability but we are the first to do so in a way that speaks to regular people. Our branding, design and strategy all revolves around speaking our modern society's language. We aim to provide value and utility to our user's lives first and foremost, then only after that can we consider sustainability.<span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><h4>What are the donations going towards?</h4></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The $15,000 will fund the mvp (minimum viable product) development for the app, which is the creation of the data tracking and input functions, as well as the algorithm to transform the data into points. To go further, we need to do real user testing. We've come to this number by analyzing the scope of work and cost of development among quality partners.  </span></div><div><br/></div><div>

Honestly, we have no idea what's happening.

""The environment"". Let's be honest...the moment a person brings up the word, we immediately start to feel bad about ourselves. ""I'm not doing enough"" and ""I should do more"" is how we feel. We start to defend our actions not because we don't want to help, but because we see the problem as too hard to fix and adding discomfort to our daily lives. In our past experiences, we've encountered too many eco-products that either don't work well, are expensive, or require too much effort with minimal results. Although that may be far from the truth now, environmentalism's reputation precedes itself and to put it bluntly...it's not seen as 'cool'.


The Refuture app is a simple tool that transforms all of your positive daily actions into points that are ranked against our friends on a social platform. If you walk to work rather than drive your car, you gain points. If you spend less on your electricity bill, you gain points. This allows people to track their progress, motivate themselves and their friends, and most importantly see the collective impact they have on the world as a group. We've gamified the experience. Ultimately, it makes it easier for people to do good by encouraging them to do more of what they're already doing right, rather than forcing new uncomfortable behaviours. We believe that the only way to truly take sustainability to the next level is not to go against the mainstream, but to go with it.

THE APP




What does the Refuture App do?

Tracks the positive actions of each user into a point system.

Shows the collective impact the user has with friends and communities.

Ignites social competition through ranks, goals, levels, and achievements.





PROGRESS is important because by keeping track of ourselves, it enables us to maintain motivation to build the right habits. Refuture converts all positive actions into points and displays the user's world impact in an understandable context. Walking to work, recycling waste, using less water, etc. will award the user points according to their performance against the community average.






COMMUNITIES is how people can see the collective impact they are having on the world. Users can join multiple communities such as friends, city, country, workplace, clubs, etc. All users inside the community will have their points aggregated to a total with a collective goal target set each month. This allows for some friendly competition beyond borders:
London vs. Sydney, Harvard vs. Columbia, Nike vs. Adidas. 
By showing people that they are part of a larger movement and giving community goals, people will be more motivated and will likely build habits. 


PROFILES enable users to see their progress, badges, and most importantly world impact. Know how much positive impact you've made at all times and understand it in easy terms: how many trees planted, how much water saved, etc. 

STAY ON TOP OF YOUR DATA, we all know how much we spend on bills per month, but we don't know if we're spending more or less than our past. Refuture puts all of our activities in context to our surroundings by showing our personal progress against our own past and friends/communities.


SOCIAL COMPETITION is a large aspect of this platform; by understanding how much we're doing in comparison to our friends, we apply peer pressure to each other to do more. This motivates the user by providing worldly context of their impact. 


WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

Sustainability affects everybody no matter where you are or how much you earn - an issue beyond any borders. The problem is both large and multi-faceted, but the angle often not tackled is that of social behaviour and cultural desire. This how our founder got involved in sustainability: 



THE IMPACT
Refuture isn't just an app, it's a vision for making sustainability approachable for all. By changing the perception of environmentalism and building the habits for positive behaviours, we're helping to alter the social landscape for adopting sustainable living. So by supporting Refuture you're not just helping one project, you're helping all sustainability initiatives as a greater movement. When consumer desires change, businesses will adapt to meet them, and we truly have a self-feeding cycle for change.

We've received the support from OpenIDEO sponsored by Coca-Cola Enterprises in the recycling challenge where Refuture was selected as winner amongst 200+ ideas; we received feedback and support from hundreds of OpenIDEO community members around the world. This project is the accumulation of a global effort and now we need your help to bring Refuture to people's lives. A special shout out to Jes Simson and Sky Gilbar for all their community feedback and support - you guys are awesome!


WHERE ARE WE NOW


We've gone through all the branding, design and wireframes for Refuture. We've prepared our market entrance strategy and laid out the best path to market using lean start-up methodology. Our experienced app development partners have mapped the app and identified the core functions for creating the MVP (minimum viable product), so we have a clear idea of the costs involved for our development phases. 
We need $15,000 to create the core functions of data tracking/input along with the algorithm to convert the data into points. The hours that go into development as well as server costs for storing all the data when the app goes live is where the money will go. Once we have this phase completed, we can begin taking Refuture to the world for real usage and testing. 

Please donate and share this campaign to your friends and family. We will be very grateful for any kind of support. :)
Thank you so much!

Refuture Pioneer - According to Urban Dictionary, a pioneer is ""anything that is from an earlier era and looked upon with high regard or respect."" They certainly got that right.

Refuture Beta Tester - The moment the Refuture App gets made into reality, you'll be the first to know. You will receive a special invitation to be one of the first private beta-testers for this app (a little like receiving the golden ticket - note Willy Wonka reference). Awesome much? You'll also get a beta-tester badge for your profile.

Tote Bag - We can't get enough of tote bags - well designed ones, that is. This is one that you'd be able to take to the beach, grocery store, or even on a weekend roadtrip if you're looking to get adventurous. The Refuture team will even throw in a ""Secret Collection"" of your choosing. --




Custom Hand-drawn Name - Our illustrator from Flyghte will create a hand-drawing, commissioned especially for you. The original illustration (A5 size) will be mailed to your doorstep, and you'll be able to display it wherever you please. Comes with a digital scan too if you'd prefer. --

Big Mystery Box of Modern China - Same as a regular Mystery Box, but only bigger. And in this case, bigger...is better. --

IDEO Studio Tour - We're very happy to announce this amazing perk sponsored by IDEO, the first backer to this perk will receive a special tour of their San Francisco studio.

We'll take you on a special kind of tour. We'll make a list of things that you might find interesting - pick out a few and we'll be your eyes and ears, recording as we go and making comments on what we see. If you're lucky, you might even get the opportunity to pick some out for us...although I can already foresee some evil people making us eat buckets of chicken feet. And yes, they do sell them at almost every corner. --

FAQ
What is the Refuture app?
The Refuture app is a simple tool that tracks all of your positive daily actions into points that are ranked against your friends on a social platform. It helps to create good habits and aims to keep people motivated by providing social competition and showing collective impact.  
Why are you doing this?Sustainability is an issue shared by all of us, but it's only being tackled by a small group of people. That's not enough. We want to make sustainability something that normal people can smoothly incorporate in their lives every day, not just the people already living green. We believe people do have the desire to help - they just find it difficult to do so. So we're planting the first seeds for a bigger movement.  How are you different?We're not the first to gamify sustainability but we are the first to do so in a way that speaks to regular people. Our branding, design and strategy all revolves around speaking our modern society's language. We aim to provide value and utility to our user's lives first and foremost, then only after that can we consider sustainability.  
What are the donations going towards?The $15,000 will fund the mvp (minimum viable product) development for the app, which is the creation of the data tracking and input functions, as well as the algorithm to transform the data into points. To go further, we need to do real user testing. We've come to this number by analyzing the scope of work and cost of development among quality partners.  
If you have any feedback or ideas on what you'd like to be included in the Refuture app, feel free to reach out to us. Or if you'd like to get involved with our team, send us a message! :)

</h3> <p>Hi, my name is Ryan, and simply put: I love wine.  I moved to the great city of Charleston  a decade ago, and at that time I was introduced to wine by someone very close to me.  Since then, wine has evolved from a social hobby into a serious passion.  Over the last few years, I have been working on turning my passion into my profession.</p>
<p>Our goal is to bring a wine bar and shop to the West Ashley area of Charleston. Currently we are proposing to the build the bar in a space that's part of the Carriage Lane Shops. We want to educate our customers about different styles of wine, and hopefully even take them out of their comfort zone in order to broaden their taste buds.  By offering wines by the glass that may not be found elsewhere around the city, we invite you to try new wines that you might not typically try based on price.  Buying wines can be intimidating, and most people tend to fall back on what they already know and like.  <i>Pour</i> will offer almost all the wine we sell by the glass so you can take comfort in knowing you like a wine before you commit to a bottle.  So sit down with us, enjoy a glass, and take a bottle home with you.  I look forward to serving you at <i>Pour</i> for years to come.</p>

</div></div>","Spark's Unique Approach 


We believe that our current international aid system is broken. Spark is turning international development on its head, from top-down and prescriptive to bottom-up and community-led. While many organizations ask global experts to design
solutions to poverty, Spark works with rural communities in East Africa to identify their greatest challenges, and directly invests the resources to solve them. 
We believe that community ownership is an essential component of a successful development program.  Through a refined process of community organizing and small granting, Spark equips the poorest communities in the world with the tools and resources to tackle their greatest social and economic challenges. 

Spark trains and equips local university graduates to be Community Facilitators through a comprehensive training program. Facilitators work with infrastructure-poor villages in a structured five-month planning process. The community identifies a commonly shared social challenge and designs a project to overcome that challenge. Community members design the project implementation strategy and budget, and democratically elect a leadership team. Spark then provides each community with the funds to achieve their goals. 


   What We Need & What You Get We plan to double our reach in 2015. Spark's typical community investments are not huge: Partner communities request no more than $10,000 to achieve their commonly defined goals -- but the impact of these funds is enormous. Not only does Spark democratize funding for the poorest communities in the world, but the model builds community cohesion, empowers female leaders, and sets communities up for long-lasting development success.

</strong><p><strong>
</strong><strong>THE NEXT GENERATION OF INTELLIGENT,
HIGH-OUTPUT LED LIGHTING HAS ARRIVED!  </strong>CROSSROADS LED, a woman-owned and completely
self-funded company, has focused our expertise and experience in LED technology
to develop a complete family of multicolor and white LED products that are
18-24 months ahead of the technology available today.  Our proprietary approach to LEDs has led to
technical advances that have not only created the brightest, but also the most reliable
and efficient LED products on the market today, placing CROSSROADS LED as an
innovator in the industry.  CROSSROADS
LED is now seeking funding and contributions to establish an American-based
production facility that will compete against the cheap and poorly manufactured
LED lighting products currently offered today. 
Our intent is to not only produce and market our line of UL-tested
products but also to bring much needed jobs and opportunities to the U.S.</p><b>
</b><p><strong>What We are Seeking</strong></p>
<p>CROSSROADS
LED is seeking $250,000 in funding that will provide the seed money for a production
facility and equipment as well as the hiring of technicians to begin
production.<span>  Additional dollars will be
used in marketing, additional personnel and component inventory in order to
reduce lead time issues often faced with newly emerging technologies.</span></p>
<p><b>The Issues</b></p>
<p>Since
the beginning, CROSSROADS LED has set out to “do business differently.”<span>  That has been illustrated in a number of
areas.  First, the lighting and
technology industries have often been a “cut throat” game of cost-cutting and
“bait-and-switch.”  We committed ourselves
to making sure that our customers and our vendors could take us at our word.  Integrity and quality would always be our
foundations and our focus.  Second, we
realized that in order to keep that focus, we would need to self-fund our
company.  We were approached early on
about partnering with other entities, but only if we were willing to compromise
our standards or outsource our manufacturing overseas.  We knew we could never do that.  And third, we committed to remembering that
while we want to be a profitable business, we want to make sure that our
designs and our practices help our conviction in green technologies and higher
efficiencies.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1021099/files/20141116214401-Folds_of_Honor_01.png?1416203041"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Overcoming
the Challenges</b></p>
<p>As
stated in our video, our company is at a “crossroads.”<span>  In order to stand out in the industry and
compete on a level playing field with industry giants who rely on cheap,
overseas manufacturing and an antiquated, multi-tiered distribution model, CROSSROADS
LED must “step up its game” and provide products on the large scale.  One of the difficulties of new tech companies
today is when they “over-promise and under-deliver.”  Simply put, they either offer unproven
technologies or accept more orders than they could possibly deliver.  Our challenge is to make sure that as we
prepare to step out into the larger market with our high quality LED lighting
products, we need to establish a solid manufacturing capacity ready to back up
our promise of multiple orders delivered in a timely and efficient manner
without sacrificing quality or reliability.</span></p>
<p>There
are always risks in being a “David” in a “Goliath” industry like LED lighting.<span>  These include intellectual property
trespass/theft, unscrupulous business practices and changing the mindset that
equates quality with a recognized brand image.</span></p>
<p>We
face these challenges by being as prudent as possible with patent/trademark
protections, a focused marketing strategy that balances product data with an

<p></p></div>","THE NEXT GENERATION OF INTELLIGENT,
HIGH-OUTPUT LED LIGHTING HAS ARRIVED!  CROSSROADS LED, a woman-owned and completely
self-funded company, has focused our expertise and experience in LED technology
to develop a complete family of multicolor and white LED products that are
18-24 months ahead of the technology available today.  Our proprietary approach to LEDs has led to
technical advances that have not only created the brightest, but also the most reliable
and efficient LED products on the market today, placing CROSSROADS LED as an
innovator in the industry.  CROSSROADS
LED is now seeking funding and contributions to establish an American-based
production facility that will compete against the cheap and poorly manufactured
LED lighting products currently offered today. 
Our intent is to not only produce and market our line of UL-tested
products but also to bring much needed jobs and opportunities to the U.S.
What We are Seeking
CROSSROADS
LED is seeking $250,000 in funding that will provide the seed money for a production
facility and equipment as well as the hiring of technicians to begin
production.  Additional dollars will be
used in marketing, additional personnel and component inventory in order to
reduce lead time issues often faced with newly emerging technologies.
The Issues
Since
the beginning, CROSSROADS LED has set out to “do business differently.”  That has been illustrated in a number of
areas.  First, the lighting and
technology industries have often been a “cut throat” game of cost-cutting and
“bait-and-switch.”  We committed ourselves
to making sure that our customers and our vendors could take us at our word.  Integrity and quality would always be our
foundations and our focus.  Second, we
realized that in order to keep that focus, we would need to self-fund our
company.  We were approached early on
about partnering with other entities, but only if we were willing to compromise
our standards or outsource our manufacturing overseas.  We knew we could never do that.  And third, we committed to remembering that
while we want to be a profitable business, we want to make sure that our
designs and our practices help our conviction in green technologies and higher
efficiencies.

Overcoming
the Challenges
As
stated in our video, our company is at a “crossroads.”  In order to stand out in the industry and
compete on a level playing field with industry giants who rely on cheap,
overseas manufacturing and an antiquated, multi-tiered distribution model, CROSSROADS
LED must “step up its game” and provide products on the large scale.  One of the difficulties of new tech companies
today is when they “over-promise and under-deliver.”  Simply put, they either offer unproven
technologies or accept more orders than they could possibly deliver.  Our challenge is to make sure that as we
prepare to step out into the larger market with our high quality LED lighting
products, we need to establish a solid manufacturing capacity ready to back up
our promise of multiple orders delivered in a timely and efficient manner
without sacrificing quality or reliability.
There
are always risks in being a “David” in a “Goliath” industry like LED lighting.  These include intellectual property
trespass/theft, unscrupulous business practices and changing the mindset that
equates quality with a recognized brand image.
We
face these challenges by being as prudent as possible with patent/trademark
protections, a focused marketing strategy that balances product data with an
education on becoming a knowledgeable LED consumer and a commitment to provide
independent UL-certified test data in lieu of the “internally generated” (and
not always accurate or reliable) in-house test data that is often provided by
larger corporations.  Additionally, we
have made the corporate decision that no matter how we approach a potential
client or business deal, we will NEVER sacrifice our integrity or our ethics.Other Ways You Can Help
We
understand that not everyone has the resources to financially contribute to our
campaign.  But wait!  There’s still a place for you in our journey!
Our
mission is to provide high-quality LED products that reduce both global CO2
emissions and the crippling energy demand on our aging infrastructure and to do
so with integrity right here in America. 
And if you believe in our mission as we do, then tell a friend about our

<p>Hi guys, we are three young engineers with a passion: Italy and Italian Food. When we studied together we had a dream: telling everyone about the real flavors and secrets of Italy. Now we are living between Madrid and London, and everyone we run into gets excited when we say, “We are Italian!.”</p>
<p>They want to know everything about our country:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which is the best monument to visit in Rome?</li>
<li>Where was the real Pizza born and which is the best pizzeria in Naples?</li>
<li>Where can we drink the best Red Chianti wine in Tuscany?</li>
<li>Which is the best Italian restaurant in their city?</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>We are doing this campaign to expand our Video community <strong>Comoenitaly.com</strong> into other countries, translating these answers into many languages and making Comoenitaly.com enjoyed by all those addicted to Italy and Italian food!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our funding Goal:<strong><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.comoenitaly.com//userfiles/image012.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>We need a big fund to realize our dream, we’re talking about <strong>100.000€</strong>. To create our network in the biggest Cities and Country of the World, we have to develop our commercial network and invest a lot of money in advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Whoever you are (our fan, a nerd, a lovers of Italian pasta, an Italian abroad, or a Millionaire with an Italian ancestor..) and you have decided to help us, we are forever  grateful to you.  Additionally, we would like to say thank you by providing you with a unique perk: a tour in our bay, visiting Naples, Pompei, Capri and Ischia Island, Amalfi Coast where you can discover the real flavors of Italy with us.</strong></p>
<p>N.B: If we reach our funding goal we will use this money to complete our platform and create a bigger network, moving to a second and third country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Through your contribution we could</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Help owners of Italian restaurants to become known to our community</li>
<li>Advise  our followers where they can eat authentic Italian food: both abroad and in Italy</li>
<li>Help many little regional producers of Italy to export their typical products</li>
<li>...tell us how we could bring these products to you.</li>
</ul><p>If you feel we can help in any other way, feel free to contact us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thanks to Indiegogo</strong></p>
<p>We know that Indiegogo is a big opportunity for everyone to help lay the seeds, but now we need you… tomorrow you'll do the same!!</p>

<p>Ciao ragazzi, siamo tre giovani ingegneri con una passione: l'Italia e il cibo italiano. Quando abbiamo studiato insieme avevamo un sogno: raccontare a tutti i veri sapori e i segreti dell’Italia. Ora viviamo tra Madrid e Londra, ogni persona che incontriamo qui e in ogni viaggio è entusiasta quando diciamo che siamo italiani!.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vogliono sapere tutto ciò che riguarda il nostro paese:</li>
<li>Qual è il più bel monumento da visitare a Roma?</li>
<li>Dove è nata la vera pizza e quale è la migliore pizzeria di Napoli?</li>
<li>Dove possiamo bere il miglior vino rosso Chianti in Toscana?</li>
<li>Qual’è il miglior ristorante italiano nella loro città all’estero?</li>

Hi guys, we are three young engineers with a passion: Italy and Italian Food. When we studied together we had a dream: telling everyone about the real flavors and secrets of Italy. Now we are living between Madrid and London, and everyone we run into gets excited when we say, “We are Italian!.”
They want to know everything about our country:

Which is the best monument to visit in Rome?
Where was the real Pizza born and which is the best pizzeria in Naples?
Where can we drink the best Red Chianti wine in Tuscany?
Which is the best Italian restaurant in their city?
 
We are doing this campaign to expand our Video community Comoenitaly.com into other countries, translating these answers into many languages and making Comoenitaly.com enjoyed by all those addicted to Italy and Italian food!!
 
Our funding Goal:
We need a big fund to realize our dream, we’re talking about 100.000€. To create our network in the biggest Cities and Country of the World, we have to develop our commercial network and invest a lot of money in advertising.
Whoever you are (our fan, a nerd, a lovers of Italian pasta, an Italian abroad, or a Millionaire with an Italian ancestor..) and you have decided to help us, we are forever  grateful to you.  Additionally, we would like to say thank you by providing you with a unique perk: a tour in our bay, visiting Naples, Pompei, Capri and Ischia Island, Amalfi Coast where you can discover the real flavors of Italy with us.
N.B: If we reach our funding goal we will use this money to complete our platform and create a bigger network, moving to a second and third country.
 
Through your contribution we could :

Help owners of Italian restaurants to become known to our community
Advise  our followers where they can eat authentic Italian food: both abroad and in Italy
Help many little regional producers of Italy to export their typical products
...tell us how we could bring these products to you.
If you feel we can help in any other way, feel free to contact us.
 
Thanks to Indiegogo
We know that Indiegogo is a big opportunity for everyone to help lay the seeds, but now we need you… tomorrow you'll do the same!!

<p>You may have recently seen news footage about a shooting in Tempe, AZ, involving a young man named Ryan Hall.  Ryan was involved in a tragic, near death experience about three weeks ago, when he was shot through the back by a man attempting to murder him. </p>

<p>This campaign has been put together to help support Ryan through the variety of financial hurdles that are inherent to such an injury.</p>
<p>Ryan is currently a restaurant worker in downtown Phoenix, and the father of an almost two year old son.  He has been working in the restaurant industry for a few years now with the hope of eventually developing a business in audio and video production.</p>
<p>We are asking that you will take the time to consider making a donation to help Ryan through an immensely undeserved and challenging set of circumstances.</p>

<h3>
<em>En arrivant on peut découvrir un lac. En le longeant, on accède à l'entrée de la propriété. </em><em>C'est là que se dressent, la maison du gardien, l'accueil, ainsi qu'un joli bâtiment construit sur Pilotis, pour prendre en toute quiétude le petit déjeuner, boire un café</em><em> ou se restaurer.<br/></em>
</h3>
<h3><em>En s'avançant, dissimulé sous les arbres, on aperçoit  le premier chalet, magnifique avec sa terrasse dominant le lac.</em></h3>
<h3><em>Plus loin, un petit pont de bois enjambe la rivière, d'où nous pouvons apercevoir deux autres gîtes avec leur terrasse, d'où, depuis sa chaise longue ont peut facilement surveiller les enfants qui font du pédalo et du canoë sur le lac.<br/></em></h3>
<h3><em>Un petit chemin à gauche, suit le lit de  la rivière et nous emmène à d'autres maisons de bois posées sur la rive, dans un calme juste troublé par les oiseaux et le clapotis de l'eau.</em></h3>
<h3><em>Enfin , en continuant la ballade,  on découvre d'autres chalets nichés dans les bois , et de jolies cabanes cachées dans les arbres. </em></h3>
<h3>
<em>Parmi toutes les essences regroupées dans notre domaine, se dresse une érablière. </em><em>Nous allons l'exploiter, afin de vous faire découvrir la cabane à sucre , et goûter notre sirop.</em>
</h3>
<h3><em>Le domaine compte une dizaine de chalets et cabanes, tous individuels, invisibles les uns des autres, préservant l'intimité de chacun, mais restant proches.</em></h3>
<h3>
<em>Nous disposeront également d'un chalet en bois rond, grand confort, avec 3 chambres, grand salon et salle à manger, cuisine américaine, et une cheminée majestueuse. Il sera facile d'y </em><em>accueillir des groupes de 8/10 personnes.</em>
</h3>
<h3><em>Chaque chalet et cabane dispose, d'au moins deux grandes chambres avec 2 lits, ainsi que toutes les commodités, salle de bain, toilettes, eau chaude, télévision, accès internet, Climatisation et chauffage.</em></h3>
<h3>
<em>J'aimerais aussi pouvoir installer un lieu totalement dédié au bien être. </em><em>Quel bonheur de se glisser dans un sauna ou un Spa, après une bonne journée à l'extérieur, ou se prélasser au son d'une douce musique avec un bon bouquin! </em>

En arrivant on peut découvrir un lac. En le longeant, on accède à l'entrée de la propriété. C'est là que se dressent, la maison du gardien, l'accueil, ainsi qu'un joli bâtiment construit sur Pilotis, pour prendre en toute quiétude le petit déjeuner, boire un café ou se restaurer.

En s'avançant, dissimulé sous les arbres, on aperçoit  le premier chalet, magnifique avec sa terrasse dominant le lac.
Plus loin, un petit pont de bois enjambe la rivière, d'où nous pouvons apercevoir deux autres gîtes avec leur terrasse, d'où, depuis sa chaise longue ont peut facilement surveiller les enfants qui font du pédalo et du canoë sur le lac.
Un petit chemin à gauche, suit le lit de  la rivière et nous emmène à d'autres maisons de bois posées sur la rive, dans un calme juste troublé par les oiseaux et le clapotis de l'eau.
Enfin , en continuant la ballade,  on découvre d'autres chalets nichés dans les bois , et de jolies cabanes cachées dans les arbres. 

Parmi toutes les essences regroupées dans notre domaine, se dresse une érablière. Nous allons l'exploiter, afin de vous faire découvrir la cabane à sucre , et goûter notre sirop.

Le domaine compte une dizaine de chalets et cabanes, tous individuels, invisibles les uns des autres, préservant l'intimité de chacun, mais restant proches.

Nous disposeront également d'un chalet en bois rond, grand confort, avec 3 chambres, grand salon et salle à manger, cuisine américaine, et une cheminée majestueuse. Il sera facile d'y accueillir des groupes de 8/10 personnes.

Chaque chalet et cabane dispose, d'au moins deux grandes chambres avec 2 lits, ainsi que toutes les commodités, salle de bain, toilettes, eau chaude, télévision, accès internet, Climatisation et chauffage.

J'aimerais aussi pouvoir installer un lieu totalement dédié au bien être. Quel bonheur de se glisser dans un sauna ou un Spa, après une bonne journée à l'extérieur, ou se prélasser au son d'une douce musique avec un bon bouquin! 

Voila, mon rêve de ""Cabane au Canada"".
C'est dans ce cadre, que J'aimerais vous recevoir, pour un séjour inoubliable.  http://www.lacabaneaucanada.fr/

<p>Hi, we are Allison and
Lonna, the owners of Crimson.  </p>
<p>Our campaign is to raise
the money to move our shop from its tiny space in Temescal Alley into a larger
space in the alley.  This larger space
will allow us to spread out and do the things that we originally wanted to do
when we conceptualized the shop, like teach gardening and plant care classes,
host community building events, and carry a wider variety of indoor and outdoor
plants and gardening supplies.</p>
<p>By contributing to our
campaign, you will help us fix up our new space in a beautiful, old historic
building that needs some serious love before we can move in.  The old walls need to be re-plastered, the
concrete floor needs to be leveled, and the old windows need to be fixed so
that they are operable.  We also need to
build shelves and a new counter/ work-space, as well as fill the shop with all sorts
of beautiful and amazing things to buy.</p>
<p>We have some unique and
hand made perks for those who contribute which include airplants, handmade
terrariums, planted succulents, fresh flowers or orchids
every month for a year, and lastly a free consultation and garden design.  </p>
<p>Your contribution, no
matter how small, will help us reach or goal to move into our larger space and
continue our commitment to our customers and the community in and around the
alley.</p>
<p>Please help us spread
the word, Indiegogo has some great share tools to make it easy!</p>

<p>In 2007 we launched Smart Money Chicks™, A Financial Education Company for Women. We are designed to be different than the traditional financial marketing and educational models. Live educational events are the key to women having success in their financial lives.</p>
<p class=""Default"">We have held events for the last 5 years in the Atlanta Area as well as online and are proud to say that we have laid a foundation for a very bright future. The emotional energy is high at all of our events and it continues to reinforce the message that women want to know more. They want to have fun collaborating and connecting in a safe and energizing atmosphere ALL while learning and talking about MONEY and their Business.</p>
<h3><strong>The Smart Money Chicks Summit,</strong></h3>
<p>is a unique conference for women that focus on the area of Business and Personal Finance. Women, Entrepreneurs and community leaders from across the Atlanta Area will join together for a powerful 2 days of learning in the area of business and personal finances.</p>
<h3><strong>The Reality</strong></h3>
<p style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">American women are the #1 consumer group in the world. They control over 50% of all the country’s wealth--to the tune of $14 trillion. This number is expected to rise to $22 trillion in 2020, yet many women feel they do not have the education needed to manage this money.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;""><span>While the number of <em>women </em>starting their own business <em>outpaces </em>men, revenue for female owned companies still lags behind. Less than 3% of women owned businesses reach the Million Dollar Mark.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How you can Help?</strong></h3>
<p>DONATE!  It is important for us to keep our ticket prices as low as possible without losing quality content and making the SMC Summit worthwhile for everyone.  In order to make this possible, we will need help from the community.  Every dollar contributed will be put right back into the conference!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways to Help...</h3>
<p>Do you know someone who can benefit from the SMC Summit? We would love for you to spread the word to friends, families and coworkers...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What others have said about past SMC events!</h3>
<p><em>""It was one of the best conferences that I have attended. Knowledgeable speakers with a long list of information. I would have paid more more for the weath of knowledge delivered.""</em></p>
<p><em>""Very informative. All the speakers gave great advice and insight on how to build a pleasant positive relationship with money.""</em></p>
<p><em>""It was really fun meeting everyone, the topics were very informative. I just wish it would have lasted longer so we could go to more classes.""</em></p>
<p><em>”Your seminars exude ethics, sincerity, and honesty, that is one reason I have been so hooked on the people associated with you and your group. I totally trust anyone that is affiliated with Smart Money Chicks.""</em></p></div>","About Smart Money Chicks ™

American women are the #1 consumer group in the world. They control over 50% of all the country’s wealth--to the tune of $14 trillion. This number is expected to rise to $22 trillion in 2020, yet many women feel they do not have the education needed to manage this money.
While the number of women starting their own business outpaces men, revenue for female owned companies still lags behind. Less than 3% of women owned businesses reach the Million Dollar Mark.

<p>The New Waterfront Festival is a free, collaborative event made possible by City of Seattle entities, non-profit organizations, Waterfront businesses, and the community of Seattle. Intended to increase awareness and to gain consumer support for businesses during Seawall construction throughout the fall and winter of 2014/15, NWF is also a platform for all Seattle businesses to be seen and heard as a united force that can make a difference.</p>
<p>Did we mention it ends in a light show on the Great Wheel set to the live musical performance of Vaudeville Etiquette?</p>
<p>We understand that as an independently owned and operated business, you may not often have the opportunity to be a part of large events like this. By becoming a NWF Sponsor, you can utilize the broad Festival platform to be seen and heard in a large market at an affordable price, simultaneously boosting the local economy of Seattle.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>While City organizations and Partners are pitching in what they have to make the Festival a reality, we need money to pay the performers, print all the signage and festival merchandise, do a proper ad campaign to spread our message, and to cover a few other logistical and legal expenses. In return, you get the broad platform of a City-wide festival that will reach the masses of Seattle and surrounding regions.</p> <ul>
<li>We need sponsorship dollars to pay performers what they deserve, print all signage for the stages and Waterfront Park, a trash and recycling contract to protect the Puget Sound, audio engineering and lighting, festival merchandise to sell to give to our volunteers, tents and tables to give us shelter from the October rain, and an ad campaign that will properly spread the message of the festival and it's purpose - to gain awareness and continued consumer support during a time of difficult construction obstacles.

Your brand will be broadcast on a highly regarded radio station (NWCZ Radio), printed on festival signage, have placement on our social media outlets and website, and be included in all festival related press releases. Your logo will also be added to our promotional print and web campaigns, which will reach the entirety of Seattle and it's surrounding regions.</li> <li>If we don't reach our goal, the money we receive will go to pay performers what they've been contracted for, as they will have given up other paying gigs to be at the festival.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact of your sponsorship will reach much further than just an event. With each sponsor that joins this cause, the message of a community taking care of their own will become apparent.

In addition to gaining this awareness, you will prove that by working together in a collaborative fashion, it is possible to reach goals that are not possible to reach on your own.</p> <ul>
<li><p>We want to continue the spirit of collaboration long after NWF lights have gone down and we've all packed up and gone home. As local businesses work together for a good cause, we will inspire a future of creating mutually beneficial relationships for many future projects and causes.

<p>Hello Indigogo people, my name is Clinton and I am so close<br/>to capturing my lifelong dream of owning my own seaplane business, but I need<br/>your help. I live in a beautiful coastal area in Australia on Queensland’s south east coast and really can’t believe that no one has thought of doing what I want to do sooner! </p>
<p> I have been an aviation fanatic for as long as I can remember and have been a licensed pilot for the last 10 years. I work hard during the week to support my family and fly as often as I can on weekends but nothing would beat ripping holes in the skies everyday in a Beaver seaplane showcasing what this fantastic place has to offer. Having my own business would release me from the burden of working for the man and justify the huge cost I had to pay in obtaining all my licenses.</p>
<p>Over the last 15+months I have worked with the authorities of the Moreton Bay Marine Park to obtain the necessary approvals to operate the seaplane within the park. I have also sourced an aircraft that is currently being FULLY rebuilt for us to<br/>use. This means that if all goes to plan, my aircraft will be brand new and be<br/>wowwing my customers as soon as I can secure the funding we need to get started. We live on the coast and I, like many people that live in my area use the bay as our<br/>backyard. Just off the coast is Moreton Island home to the world class Tangalooma <br/>Resort that up until now can only be accessed by an hour and a half ferry ride from the Port of Brisbane. Moreton Bay Seaplanes DeHavilland Beaver seaplane will be able leave an airport on the mainland coast and cross Moreton Bay to the island in as little as 10mins!</p>
<p>The area is also home to many other unspoilt islands that we<br/>intend to visit and all have crystal clear tropical waters abundant with reefs for<br/>snorkelling and scores of wildlife such as green sea turtles, whales and<br/>dugong. Other tours will involve day trips to the Tangalooma Resort that offers all<br/>sorts of activities such as sand tobogganing, quad bike tours, parasailing and<br/>glass bottom boat adventures. We will also be offering the young and the young<br/>at heart a flightseeing/jet ski adventure where passengers enjoy some wonderful<br/>views of the nearby Glasshouse Mountains before experiencing the thrill of<br/>taking charge of a Jet Ski within the Pumicestone Passage. </p>
<p>The funds we need will be put towards the purchase of things<br/>like the cost of insurance, our website, headsets for the aircraft, slim life jackets for<br/>passengers, marketing and ferry fuel to fly our new aircraft from where it’s being<br/>rebuilt in Sydney up to Brisbane. In return for your generosity you will<br/>receive a token of our appreciation and if you like, regular updates of goings<br/>on via an email newsletter on how we’re tracking. If you’re unable to<br/>contribute you can still help by spreading the word of my dream to reach as<br/>many people as possible. Thankyou in advance to all the generous people that<br/>help to make my dream possible and I hope to someday take you on one of our tours!</p>

<div> On September 7, 1876, the James-Younger Gang rode into Northfield, Minnesota, intent on raiding the First National Bank.  The good people of Northfield, rallied by the cry ""Get yer guns, boys, they're robbin' the bank!"", gathered with their rifles and pistols to defend the bank and the town.  Defeated and bloody, the gang left Northfield, never again to ride as the James-Younger Gang.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now Northfield is facing another challenge, to save the 1888 Depot, or to let it be demolished.  The Northfield depot is an historically and architecturally significant landmark on the West Side of downtown.  If we don't act <strong>NOW</strong>, it will be demolished and its history lost forever.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>An old and faithful friend, the Northfield depot was the town's primary link to the world outside. Since 1888 it was the hub for moving goods from farm to market; bringing students to Carleton and St. Olaf College from across the nation; and transporting troops to the Spanish-American War and World Wars I and II. Its story is the story of Northfield. Now is our last chance for it to once again play a strong role in the city's economic growth.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once moved and revitalized, the depot will serve the community as a transportation hub. Buses from the Twin Cities will drop off and pick up passengers at the Depot.  There will be a bike rack of bicycles that visitors can use to explore the historic town of Northfield.  The interior of the Depot will be available for historical rail road displays, or as a gallery for local artists.  A sculpture area is planned for display of local artist sculptures.  The Northfield Depot will become a beautiful and vital part of Northfield.</div>

<div>• Create a space for exhibition and a sculpture garden</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Funds raised will be added to the $90,000 already raised.  Feel free to check out <a href=""http://www.northfielddepot.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website</a> at northfielddepot.org for more detailed information. <em>We are a 501 (c) (3) non-profit so your donation is tax-deductible.  </em>

<h3>How to ""Ride with the James-Younger Gang"":</h3>
<p>Every year in September the James-Younger Gang once again attempts to rob the Northfield First National Bank.  The ""Gang"" of re-enactors put on their dusters, strap on their gunbelts, saddle up and ride into Northfield.  <strong>You</strong> can ride along side of Jesse James and Cole Younger as they make their way into town to raid the bank. For a contribution of $5,000, you can have this a once-in-a-lifetime experience!  Jesse James will meet you at your hotel, provide you with a well-trained horse, a duster, gunbelt and pistol, and introduce you to the adventure of becoming a member of the outlaw gang.  You will also receive a professionally filmed CD of your ride, and become a life-long honorary member of the gang.</p>
<p>However, if you are more the law and order type, for a donation of $2,500 you can take part in the defense of the bank and town by joining the townfolk re-enactors.  Jesse James will meet you at your hotel, provide you with a costume, a rifle or pistol, and  place you in a location where you can help destroy the band of desperadoes.  You will also receive a professionally filmed CD of your defense of the bank.  </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: Another opportunity to re-enact is during the St. Olaf and Carleton special Reunion Re-enactments June 1 or June 20 of 2013. The rest of the perk remains the same. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You will be contacted immediately to pick your date.</strong></p>
<p>There are many other perks listed to the right of the screen.  If you aren't ready to become a bankrobber or a town defender, perhaps one of the other options would be more to your liking.</p>

</p><p>We hoped you
liked our video we had some fun making it, some of the cuts you see in the
video are a small portion of the amazing young talent we have had the
opportunity to work with whilst at university, with this soon coming to an end
we are looking to take a major step into the industry.</p>
<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>
</h3><h3><b>Who are we and what do we plan to do and
why?</b></h3>
<p>We are
Fiermente Productions a group of 3 students that all met at university and
discovered we had a similar passion and desire for recording and producing
great music. We all came from different backgrounds with different skills that
after working together we found those skills to be very complimentary. What we
would like to do with Fiermente is to create an affordable and high quality
production studio, as we have seen so many young talented people over the past
3 years ranging from buskers on the streets of London to other students at the
university. This has been going quite well over the past 6 months or so, as we
have had the facilities available to us to get the people into the studio to create some amazing sounding music as I am sure you will agree. Check it
out on the website under portfolio <a href=""http://www.fiermente.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fiermente.co.uk</a> </p>
<p>But this is
all due to come to an end as we are about to leave university when we have
looked around for a studio we could hire out to take artists into we have found
that they are either very expensive or not good enough quality. I hear you say ‘but
some people just do it from there house’ but as much as this is true, we want
to take this to the next level, having already put about £4,000 in to the
equipment, website, marketing and a few other things. We believe we can really
make a difference in the British music scene we have the passion, we have the
dedication and we have the talent you can judge that for yourself on <a href=""http://www.fiermente.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fiermente.co.uk</a>.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">WE JUST NEED
YOUR SUPPORT </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p><h3><b>What we need and why in detail?</b></h3>
<p>We are
looking for £15,000 in total this will be split to the following things</p>
<p>£4200 towards
a space, this will be dry hire of a recording space in London, this will give
us the deposit and 6 months rent, which will give us a good start in getting
set up to maximize the quality and efficiency of the studio.</p>
<p>£4000 towards
microphones, as much as we already have a small collection of microphones,
every microphone is build for a specific purpose and we do need to expand our
range to be able to record every instrument to maintain consistence in the
quality of our recording.</p>

We hoped you
liked our video we had some fun making it, some of the cuts you see in the
video are a small portion of the amazing young talent we have had the
opportunity to work with whilst at university, with this soon coming to an end
we are looking to take a major step into the industry.

Who are we and what do we plan to do and
why?
We are
Fiermente Productions a group of 3 students that all met at university and
discovered we had a similar passion and desire for recording and producing
great music. We all came from different backgrounds with different skills that
after working together we found those skills to be very complimentary. What we
would like to do with Fiermente is to create an affordable and high quality
production studio, as we have seen so many young talented people over the past
3 years ranging from buskers on the streets of London to other students at the
university. This has been going quite well over the past 6 months or so, as we
have had the facilities available to us to get the people into the studio to create some amazing sounding music as I am sure you will agree. Check it
out on the website under portfolio www.fiermente.co.uk 
But this is
all due to come to an end as we are about to leave university when we have
looked around for a studio we could hire out to take artists into we have found
that they are either very expensive or not good enough quality. I hear you say ‘but
some people just do it from there house’ but as much as this is true, we want
to take this to the next level, having already put about £4,000 in to the
equipment, website, marketing and a few other things. We believe we can really
make a difference in the British music scene we have the passion, we have the
dedication and we have the talent you can judge that for yourself on www.fiermente.co.uk.WE JUST NEED
YOUR SUPPORT 
What we need and why in detail?
We are
looking for £15,000 in total this will be split to the following things
£4200 towards
a space, this will be dry hire of a recording space in London, this will give
us the deposit and 6 months rent, which will give us a good start in getting
set up to maximize the quality and efficiency of the studio.
£4000 towards
microphones, as much as we already have a small collection of microphones,
every microphone is build for a specific purpose and we do need to expand our
range to be able to record every instrument to maintain consistence in the
quality of our recording.
£1000 will go
towards acoustic treatment, a room with bad acoustics can ruin a good
recording, it can make recordings sound unclear or unnatural, so each live room
would have to be treated to achieve a clean and clear sound.
£800 Towards
furniture, simply put, we would need sofas, chairs, table and everything to
make our clients as comfortable as possible to keep them working hard and
inspired.
£1000 towards
monitoring speakers, we have purchased monitoring speakers already but speakers
depend strongly on the size of the room and distance from the listening
position, so an alternative pair are needed to monitor the recordings
correctly.
£1500 for
Marketing/PR as clients are hard to come by, we will need to constantly be
marketing ourselves to our target market to keep work up.£2000 for some additional software to make our rig completely  professional.£500 additional equipment e.g cables, stands, ect.....

<p><b>Do/Luck?</b></p>
<p>Do/Luck is a design group found in the fall
of 2013 by three graphic design students
who attend Virginia Commonwealth
University. Having pride and love towards
their motherland, the Republic of Korea,
Do/Luck specializes in research and design
involving Hangul. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>EXHIBITION MOTIVES</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Do/Luck found themselves learning the
importance and value of their first language
going through many communicative
obstacles in English. The passion and interest
in Hangul came through longing to explore
Korean Typography more in depth than the
Roman alphabetical typography. This interest
motivated the group to hold an exhibition
spreading the word of Hangul’s great
aesthetics and structural design. The first
obstacle Do/Luck came to is that not
everyone knew upon encountered ‘Hangul.’
In Korea, where Hangul is the first language,
it is easier to attract more attention in its
design aspects. However, exhibiting how
Hangul is beautiful and physiologically driven
to a person who does not know anything
about Hangul will only become an exhibition
for our own goods rather than asking for
agreement or interest from the American
audience. In order for Do/Luck’s exhibition
</p>
<p>to be effective it is essential that visitors
know how to read Korean. This motivated
the group to teach the American audience
how to read Hangul in a fun and easy way by
hosting a Hangul Market. </p>

<br/><p>
</p>
<p>

<div>
<div>
<p><b>WHY SO IMPORTANT?
</b></p>
<p>Numerous linguists have praised hangul for
its featural design, describing it as
“remarkable”, “the most perfect phonetic
system devised”, and “brilliant, so deliberately
does it fit the language like a glove.” The
principal reason Hangul has attracted
</p>
<p>this praise is that the shapes of the letters
are related to the features of the sounds
they represent: the letters for consonants
pronounced in the same place in the mouth
are built on the same underlying shape.
</p>
<p>In addition, vowels are made from vertical<br/>
or horizontal lines so that they are easily
distinguishable from consonants. Hangul
has a written record explaining the principles
that went into its invention. Hangul is so easy
and systematic that anyone can learn how to
read it in just a few hours,
</p>
<p>if you already know how to speak some
Korean. If you are new to the Korean language,
it might take a little longer. However, learning
to read is so easy in Hangul. </p>

<p><b>EXHIBITION CONCEPT
</b></p>
<p>In the United States, farmers’ market exist
for people to sell local produce and goods to

We want to use the idea of farmer’s market

<p><b>EXHIBITION PURPOSE
</b></p>
<p>The Hangul Market Exhibition’s goal does<br/>
not aim to teach the American audience<br/>
to learn perfectly how to read and write in
hangul. The bigger picture for the group is to
teach how hangul is different physiologically
created based on human biological features
and teach the systems of the structural
aspect of Hangul. Do/Luck hopes to teach
American audiences how to distinguish
hangul from other alphabet. Currently
Korean culture receiving more attention,
Do/Luck wants to use this opportunity to
teach about Korea and hangul and its
excellence educational perspective. The
group would also like to provide fun visual
experiences for those interested in learning
hangul. Learning a second language is a way
to build influential power towards any nation
that will also build and strengthen its cultural
identity. A particular living in a foreign
country is an opportunity for the group
members to show pride in mother country. </p>

If giving something for nothing doesn't work for you, I'm trying to set up an ebay or other page where you can buy some of the old or classic games that have accumulated in my house (including games for systems as far back as Nintendo 64, SNES, and PlayStation 1) and all proceeds will go to keeping my family afloat. I'm also getting things set up so maybe I can do sewing or craft commissions. Basically, keep an eye on this space! Rewards will pop up!
Thank you for reading, thank you for caring (even if you can't give), have an excellent day.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I was hatched from a dragon's egg three decades ago and kidnapped by... ok, no, not really. I'm originally from NJ but I currently reside in Western Massachusetts with my husband and our dog. I've been working in Internet retail since 2004 and my expertise is in search engine optimization and usability. I also have a Cafepress shop for my graphic design work and an Etsy shop for my polymer clay sculptures. Most importantly I have a marketing consultation company called Strange Child Productions. I provide business support and website development for people with limited spare time, limited resources, and whose projects might not always make sense to a traditional business consultant.</p>
<p>The whole world can be your marketplace and your fan base doesn't have to be restricted to your home town. I want to show people that brick and mortar stores and galleries aren't the only way to reach people anymore. I've been helping artists and crafters sell their work online for a few years now and I really love it. I get to meet new people and help them figure out what they need to do to get more exposure. I feel like there are lots of marketing consultants out there looking to work for large companies, but I want to focus on the needs of individuals, startups and small companies.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>I've set myself a $1000 goal because this will help cover some paid advertising and some of the equipment I don't already have. I'm launching a series of ""in home"" workshops and to do this I'm going to need an overhead projector and screen, and eventually a new laptop. I am also hoping to put together print marketing materials for clients who like to have documents they can hold in their hands.</p>
<p>Any extra funds will go towards a series of free workshops in locations that are easily accessible from public transportation.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>STUFF! Awesome stuff. Useful Stuff. Educational Stuff. Or maybe even helpful stuff.</p>
<p>No seriously. I've got a variety of perks for different budgets and interests. I'm offering bumper stickers, sculpture and coupons for consultation and training.</p>
<p><strong>Spread the word!</strong></p>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, share my campaign with your friends. Every little bit helps.</p></div>","She Who Must Consult
