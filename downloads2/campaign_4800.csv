<h3>Help Build a Sculpture for the Gregg Museum in Raleigh.</h3>
<p><strong>UPDATE: As of 12/1 we have received over $14,000 from our IndieGoGo campaign, private donations and in-kind donations to build a sculpture for the Gregg Museum of Art &amp; Design. Thank you for your support as we continue our campaign for the Gregg Tree Project!</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Ann, Mike, Justin and the Gregg Tree Project Team</strong></p>
<p>Like you, we know that with growth comes inevitable impacts to the environment, and we love the idea of deliberately re-purposing the trees, rather than running them through the wood chipper and turning them into mulch.</p>
<p>With your help, we hope to fabricate the sculpture for the Gregg lawn using the smaller (9,000 Lb +) of the two trees.  The larger tree (20,000 LB +) will be slabbed (3 1/2"" - 4"" slabs), ricked and air-dried (3 years minimum) by the sawyer as preparation for future custom furniture or art for the Gregg or another location at NCSU. Our dear friend and local filmmaker David Hambridge will document the fabrication and installation process over the next several months. </p>
<h3><strong>Why Does this Matter and What Can We Achieve?</strong></h3>
<p>We hope the sculpture will remind us to pay attention to the growth, decay, or destruction that happens around us constantly, so that we might be compelled to reuse, recreate, or even better, find ways around destruction of the natural environment.  We are excited by the growth and cultural developments in Raleigh, but we also recognize that we bear a responsibility to lessen the negative impacts where at all possible.  This gives us all a way to demonstrate a respect for, and commitment to, the trees that have been here much longer than we have. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Needs: Our funding needs reflect design, fabrication and transportation of the log, with a more detailed breakdown on our <a href=""http://www.greggtreeproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website.</a>
</li>
<li>Perks: We don't have stuff to give, but we'll thank you on the Gregg Tree Project site and social media, and we'll wine and dine our major supporters at the studios (we're all great cooks.)  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why We're Doing This</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are passionate (and we know you are too) about honoring the environment and these trees, not only as objects of North Carolina State University's history, but also as testaments to their perpetual worthiness in Raleigh’s landscape. We are confident in our collective ability to deliver a meaningful and relevant piece of sculpture, and we’d be honored to do so for the Gregg and for Raleigh.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE GREGG MUSEUM</strong></p>
<p>The Gregg did not begin as a museum; it became one. It began when a former NC State chancellor and dean sought to enhance NC State’s mission by acquiring and exhibiting art that reflected the university’s curricula. By the late 1970's this program had evolved into the Visual Arts Program. With the opening of an addition to Talley Student Center in 1992, it became the Visual Arts Center and accommodated  a collection of up to 5,000 objects. Today, the Gregg Museum holds a collection of nearly seven times that.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT EIDOLON DESIGNS</strong></p>
<p>Ann Cowperthwaite and Mike Parker co-founded Eidolon Designs, which has over three decades of experience in fine custom craftwork and sculpture. Mike’s focus is engineering and flawless craftsmanship; Ann’s is design and sculpture.  Additionally, Eidolon is a foundational member of the local design and craft community, and, as such, will be similarly foundational in engaging Raleigh in this endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>What is REACTOR? </strong></p>
<p>REACTOR is a 15 foot winding, shiny,LED lined, steel tree that will be driven down to Burning Man this summer in a rented truck, and assembled in a selected space on the playa for maximum sensory effect, day and night! This project is spearheaded by Ryan Longo, creator of the Intergalactic Garden Supply (IGS) and maker of party deco pieces you may be familiar with such as Magic Plants, Desert Flowers and Flying Stingrays. REACTOR promises to propel the Intergalactic Garden Supply into new galaxies and uncharted party territories! </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Team is: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ryan Longo: Everything Man and REACTOR's papa </li>
<li>Jaclyn Potechin: Merch, Materials, and Transportation Coordinator</li>
<li>Kevin Flynn: Organizer, Liaison with other maker space, Build team  </li>
<li>Cortney Lush: Camp Organizer, Assemblage and Tear down support</li>
<li>Tiphaine Leonard: Artist Support and Playa Crew </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>REACTOR's Manifesto</b></p>
<p>The amazing feedback received by Ryan with past IGS installations helped set the intention for how REACTOR might contribute, that is, by creating a space for reflection, meditation, and retreat in a whirlwind of other energies. </p>
<p>Our sculpture has been in the planning phase since late 2015. This is the final stretch, with all contributors working daily to bring a test version of REACTOR to Playground Festival (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/929526100473156/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/929526100473156/</a>).</p>
<p>Our aim is to accumulate enough funding to add some stellar finishing touches to the Burning Man 2016 model. The REACTOR build is currently financially backed by Intergalactic Garden Supply and a few key partners who are eager to see the final result. We have help from Burning Man with site selection and with providing passes for artists. We are asking you to pitch in to encourage our team during the build, and help alleviate some costs of materials and transportation. It takes time, patience, and good will to collaborate and bring something together to share with like-minded communities. We aim to bring magic and wonder to events not just as contributors, but as participants as well. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Another way to show your support is by purchasing a custom REACTOR t-shirt (40$) or hoodie (100$) or hand written post-card from the playa (20). </p>
<p><strong>Donate here! </strong>  <a href=""http://www.intergalacticgardensupply.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.intergalacticgardensupply.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Financial Stats </strong></p>
<p>REACTOR is made of steel sheet metal, rods and mesh. individual LED lightings will line the interior of the structure with magnet powered access panels to reach the inside. We are painting the sculpture with a magnificent purple/green chrome finish. REACTOR  is very inexpensive considering its size and weight- only $5000.00 in material costs! It will be disassembled and driven down to the playa in a rented truck. This rental is another $5,000.00.</p>
<p>Our total minimum overhead is 10,000.00$</p>
<p>We are looking for funds to rig the sculpture up with a surprise additional sensory experience. With hard work and your support, we hope to push towards new opportunities and bigger projects for future events! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Journey</strong></p>
<p>Hauling REACTOR down to the desert for most of our team's first Burn, in a rented truck, and towards new friends (Camp Unicorners at Cosima and 2:45) will be challenging. We will be away with the sculpture for 18 days. If this commitment seems crazy, imagine us rolling into another Ontario festival immediately after the Burn, just in time for a fall equinox celebration. What a trip!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Kay and I run Conlang Calligraph, your one-stop shop for conlang art and merch.  I create designs in conlangs--constructed languages--and fictional writing systems.  I specialize in Vulcan and Gallifreyan, but I've also worked with Klingon, Unown, Hylian, Tengwar, and several others!</p>
<p>So far, I've worked entirely online.  But now I'm getting ready to take a big step and venture out into the world of vending at conventions!  But that takes resources, from things like making sure to have a size-inclusive stock of t-shirts, to one-time purchases like a banner for my table, to having all of my queer identity designs available, to business cards and fliers and sample pieces of the merch I don't have room to stock. </p>
<p>This is the biggest project I've ever undertaken, and with your help, it might just be the best! </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>First off, I need stock!</p>
<p>$700+.  T-shirts. That's the bare minimum to have a chance of having what people want actually at the table where they're spending money--as much as $1000 to be more plus size-inclusive.</p>
<p>$100: Sample items.  These are things like leggings and skirts--the ones I want to have visible so that people will order them from my shop, but don't have the room or resources to offer from the table.</p>
<p>$200: Mugs and socks.  Mid priced items where I don't have to worry about sizing--I'm really hoping these are some of my biggest sellers!</p>
<p>$100: Change.  Gotta have those fives and tens for the cash customers!</p>
<p>$50: Credit card chip reader</p>
<p>$250: Banner.  I need to be visible and get my name out there!</p>
<p>$250: Signs, fliers, and business cards.  People have to be able to find me again.</p>
<p>$150: Miscellaneous supplies buffer.  All the little stuff I haven't thought of yet that will inevitably come up at the last minute.</p>
<p>$150: Booth fee</p>
<p>$250: Perk fund, to make sure donors get my thanks!</p>
<p>As for those perks!</p>
<p>Any Level: My unending thanks and gratitude.</p>
<p>$15: Your name (or favorite word) in Vulcan!</p>
<p>$30: Your word or phrase in Gallifreyan!</p>
<p>$45: A pair of socks with your favorite (premade) design on them!</p>
<p>$55: A coffee mug, also with your favorite design!</p>
<p>$80: Your favorite screen printed t-shirt, any size, any color!</p>
<p>$100: Your name or word in ornate, highly stylized Vulcan!</p>
<p>$150: A unique Vulcan or Gallifreyan design, printed on the mug, socks, or shirt of your choosing!</p>
<p>$250: Unique design for you in any fictional universe's alphabet.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this con is successful, it will allow me to devote more time and effort in my craft!  I'll be able to create more art.  I'll be able to add more queer identities, more words of wisdom, and of course, more hilarious profanity.  Sometimes all at once.</p>
<p>So far, I've managed to grow this thing from a hobby done purely for love into a reasonably successful online business.  It's time to branch out into offline space, and I think we can do this!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk is that the con will be a bust.  No one will buy ANYTHING, I won't even start to make back my investment.</p>
<p>Realistically, even if I don't make back my full investment, I'll be able to get my name out there, and have memory and word of mouth bring in a steady trickle of new customers to my online store.</p>
<p>Other challenges include having to guess and what will be popular and within con-goer's budgets.  But I've made my best guesses and have a free shipping coupon ready to go so that con-goers can get exactly what they want even if I didn't bring it.</p>
<p>This is definitely a leap out of my comfort zone, but I think it will be worth every challenge!</p>

It is somewhere you would go on a date, take your family or hang out with your friends, all for less than the price of going to a movie. Our goal is to make IAM accessible to the masses in regards to location, price and formality.</p><p>-- <b>Marketing </b>-- IAM will reach out to the students of Georgia Tech, Georgia State,  Oglethorpe, Emory, Clark Atlanta, and Morehouse College as well as the high schools and middle schools in 13 counties surrounding Metro Atlanta. </p><p></p><p><i>Field Trips:</i> During weekdays we will invite schools to bring students to learn about art and socialize. </p><p><i>Atlanta Art Festivals:</i> During the summer, we will utilize the almost-weekly art festivals in Atlanta to spread word of the museum, share a few pieces of art to interact with and pre-sell tickets. </p><p><i>Group Events:</i>  Wedding parties, meet-up groups, families and businesses will be invited to host private interactive parties after hours. </p><p></p><p>--<b> Product</b> -- IAM will create original pieces of art that focus on themes entertaining and meaningful to a North American audience.

What We Need & What You GetIAM offers an  all-weather, entertaining social experience in a safe and fun space!  IAM plans to regularly rotate exhibits to keep gain repeat visits, hold contests for the most creative interpretation of the art, and ask guests and the community for feedback on how the museum can be dynamic, fun and entertaining.The entire project is estimated to cost $100,000 and we are half way short of this goal. We are asking anyone who is passionate for the Atlanta community or The Arts to help us raise the remaining $50,000 we need to open the first exhibit.  We have finalized a portfolio of sketches that need to be produced to scale.  Brush-for-hire specialists will bring these sketches to life and the money we raise here will pay for the materials to produce the art, the artists and construction of the first exhibit. For your donation we have a range of IAM branded his and hers offerings that you will receive in addition to tickets to the museum (see concepts below).We will provide regular updates of our progress on our Facebook and Twitter accounts. You can also reach us at (678) 400-9035.If you prefer to donate via check:Interact Art Museum LLCPO Box 76456Atlanta GA, 30358

Challenges & Plan of Action During the Civil Rights movement Atlanta was known as ""the city too busy to hate"".  Unfortunately, at times it also seems to be too busy to love or to have fun:  how else do you explain the departure of Atlanta Thrashers -- a team that had plenty of followers, but not enough ticket buyers?  Or the whooping 9,000 visitors per year at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia? This is why we believe that IAM is first and foremost an entertainment and social gathering space. It is somewhere you would go on a date, take your family or hang out with your friends, all for less than the price of going to a movie. Our goal is to make IAM accessible to the masses in regards to location, price and formality.-- Marketing -- IAM will reach out to the students of Georgia Tech, Georgia State,  Oglethorpe, Emory, Clark Atlanta, and Morehouse College as well as the high schools and middle schools in 13 counties surrounding Metro Atlanta. Field Trips: During weekdays we will invite schools to bring students to learn about art and socialize. Atlanta Art Festivals: During the summer, we will utilize the almost-weekly art festivals in Atlanta to spread word of the museum, share a few pieces of art to interact with and pre-sell tickets. Group Events:  Wedding parties, meet-up groups, families and businesses will be invited to host private interactive parties after hours. -- Product -- IAM will create original pieces of art that focus on themes entertaining and meaningful to a North American audience. To gain repeat guests, IAM will adjust our collection based on demand and popularity. 





  Other Ways You Can Help 
We are also seeking local
volunteers to help set up/construct the first exhibit and spread word of mouth.Or if you are a local Atlanta artist that is interested in bringing our sketches to life or sharing other work that aligns with our goals, please feel free to contact us.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Please Help Us Fund the 2012 Buffalo Infringement Festival</h3>
<p>Every summer, the streets of Buffalo come alive with scores of events by local and visiting theater and dance companies, puppeteers, media artists, poets, comics, musicians, cabaret acts, digital designers, and miscellaneous insurrectionists. The <strong>Buffalo Infringement Festival</strong> provides artists and audiences of all backgrounds the chance to <strong>come together, take chances, push boundaries, and explore uncharted territory</strong> because <strong>exciting art can happen anywhere, anytime, without a blockbuster budget, </strong>or in many cases, any budget at all.</p>
<p>The festival is run by a committed group of volunteers. These people are artists, musicians, educators, parents, engineers, who dedicate a significant portion of their year to putting together this festival.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While artists do not receive fees directly from the Festival (they do have the option to charge entry to their show), substantial costs are incurred by the organizers for:</p>
<ul>
<li>publicity</li>
<li>printing the schedule in ArtVoice Magazine</li>
<li>venue fees (they can't all be free)</li>
<li>audiovisual equipment</li>
<li>other expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>These monies are raised via Indiegogo and fundraising events leading up to the actual festival. At the festival, 100% of any door receipts go to the artists. This event would not be possible without your generous donations.</p>
<p>We are offering rewards including mentioning you in our publicity materials, stickers, t-shirts, and festival passes (for those shows that do charge admission). Of course, the greatest reward is knowing that you helped fund a festival in which you can take part.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since 2005, this festival has run every year, and every year it has expanded. We have some new venues this year as well as a lot of new people getting involved. People come from out of town to participate, and the festival brings people to Buffalo who discover venues and local businesses. The festival is visible throughout the year through fundraising efforts and our call to 'Infringe Every Day'.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute, here are other ways for you to contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us get the word out using social media and word of mouth, both for our funding campaign and for the festival itself. You can use sharing tools on Indiegogo.</li>
<li>Come to the festival. The schedule will appear in ArtVoice Magazine and online in late July so you can see what is happening when.</li>
<li>Volunteer! We are always looking for some more volunteers. We will find something for you to do.</li>

<p>See you in July!</p>

Wolfgang List of the interdisciplinary design and architecture 
collective ""mostlikely"" based in Austria. The goal was to create complex objects at a low
 price that can be used as masks, posters, lampshades or something else. To achieve a low price and be able to ship our designs worldwide we deliver our lampshades as construction sets in a role of paper. The customers have to cut out, fold and glue the parts together by themselfes - DIY. The aim of our company is not only to design lampshades, we produce them also by ourselfs. All designs were printed on a large format printer and packed in our workshop in Vienna. In the middle of Europe.</p>

Since some time we have the idea to bring more color in our world and to offer our customers lampshades with designs and color all over. We want to invite artists and designers from all over the world to be part of our company and deliver color designs for our lampshades. For the start of this project we teamed up with the artist BOICUT. We met BOICUT at a trade show in Vienna one year ago. We were excited about his work and the idea of a collaboration was growing in our minds and became reality 3 months ago. BOICUT made exclusive color designs for 10 of our models. We built the prototypes and now we are on the verge of production. And here you come in! For starting the production we need your help! </p>

<p>Hi. I am Boicut. I like living in Vienna. I have a strong focus on illustration. Having artistic freedom is important to me. I love table soccer. I love to experiment with new things. I like the opportunity to see new places and meet nice people while doing my thing. I love riding my bike. I like to customize objects. I like to be challenged. Boicut is 24/365. And it feels good. I love beeing passionate. I like good smelling magazines. I get inspired by people that love what they do. I like handmade stuff. I love having a beer with friends. I am thankful for being able to do what I love. This feels like a long journey full of experiences. The collaboration with mostlikely is a new trip &amp; you can be part of it!<br/></p>

22.10.2013
We order the large format printer today and we will start production of the new lampshade series at the end of October. National and International shipping will start in the beginning of November 



21.10.2013
MOSTLIKELY X BOICUT got featured at dezeen magazine. Read the article under this link.
18.10.2013 
We won the Price for for the BEST PRODUCT at the International Tradeshow BLICKFANG in Vienna.



INTRODUCING MOSTLIKELY

The ""mostlikely DIY lampshades"" were founded 2012 by Maik Perfahl and 
Wolfgang List of the interdisciplinary design and architecture 
collective ""mostlikely"" based in Austria. The goal was to create complex objects at a low
 price that can be used as masks, posters, lampshades or something else. To achieve a low price and be able to ship our designs worldwide we deliver our lampshades as construction sets in a role of paper. The customers have to cut out, fold and glue the parts together by themselfes - DIY. The aim of our company is not only to design lampshades, we produce them also by ourselfs. All designs were printed on a large format printer and packed in our workshop in Vienna. In the middle of Europe.


www.mostlikely.atOUR VISION

Untill now we only produce lampshades in a simple white design. Since some time we have the idea to bring more color in our world and to offer our customers lampshades with designs and color all over. We want to invite artists and designers from all over the world to be part of our company and deliver color designs for our lampshades. For the start of this project we teamed up with the artist BOICUT. We met BOICUT at a trade show in Vienna one year ago. We were excited about his work and the idea of a collaboration was growing in our minds and became reality 3 months ago. BOICUT made exclusive color designs for 10 of our models. We built the prototypes and now we are on the verge of production. And here you come in! For starting the production we need your help! 



INTRODUCING BOICUT
Hi. I am Boicut. I like living in Vienna. I have a strong focus on illustration. Having artistic freedom is important to me. I love table soccer. I love to experiment with new things. I like the opportunity to see new places and meet nice people while doing my thing. I love riding my bike. I like to customize objects. I like to be challenged. Boicut is 24/365. And it feels good. I love beeing passionate. I like good smelling magazines. I get inspired by people that love what they do. I like handmade stuff. I love having a beer with friends. I am thankful for being able to do what I love. This feels like a long journey full of experiences. The collaboration with mostlikely is a new trip & you can be part of it!

www.boicut.com

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP

During the work with the artist BOICUT and the production of the first prototypes in full color we had to realise that the oversize printer we use in our office is not good enough to produce prints in high quality. With your help it will be possible to invest in a new oversize printer that makes it possible to deliver our customers high quality prints. With your help it will also be possible to start the production of the BOICUT X MOSTLIKELY collaboration and go on with our vision.




THE REWARDS



In return for your support, we are offering you to be one of the first to receive a lampshade with an exclusive design by the artist BOICUT. The prints are limited to 100 pieces per model. They are signed and numbered by the artist. Exclusive at Indiegogo you get the BOICUT X MOSTLIKELY lampshades with discount. If you like it more simple just choose one of our existing models in pure white design for a reduced price. Find a collection of all existing white models under this link.

<br/><h3>Extra Information</h3>Guys, this calendar took me hours upon hours and weeks and weeks of solid work to do. I wanted to pour every ounce of my talent into this calendar and pictures to bring you guys something you'd be more than happy to pay money towards. That said, once you get the digital copies of the pictures - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">P.L.E.A.S.E do NOT redistribute the pictures anywhere online, or upload them anywhere!</span> You can of course show them to your friends, but if they like them as well, ask them to consider donating towards the calendar so that they can get copies of their own. I am a rent-paying, food-consuming, happy starving artist just trying to make ends meet, and if one person gets the calendar only to spread the pictures/scan them and spread them around, then I would have spent the money to make the calendars for nothing! I WILL EVENTUALLY upload the pictures to the internet in a MUCH smaller file format without the calendar information, and probably crop them, but you are getting, first hand, all of the artwork in full resolution, which I don't normally dish out. Plus once I run the calendars the first time, that's it! Then they'll be gone forever!<br/><br/>So I thank you all in advance for reading this and following the rules. If this all goes smoothly, I am more than happy to continue with the FEMALE version of the calendar after summer!<br/><br/>Also just so everyone knows...<br/>
The digital calendars will ONLY get sent out once the campaign is over at the end of the 10 days. IT was going to be when I reached the target amount, but I reached that way too soon (not that I'm complaining, lol!) but I haven't finished the pictures yet, so they'll be sent out when all 10 days are up! :D So just bear with me another week and they will be off to you! &lt;3<br/><br style=""font-style: italic;""/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">""IN PEACE, VIGILANCE</span><br style=""font-style: italic;""/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">IN WAR, VICTORY</span><br style=""font-style: italic;""/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">IN DEATH, SACRIFICE</span>""<br/><h6>--the Grey Warden motto</h6>

*EDIT*
Man… I HONESTLY didn’t know that the sketch option of the calendar would be so popular.If people still want one with a sketch, just donate 10 extra dollars to the campaign, tell me you want a sketch and what of, and I’ll make sure yours gets a sketch as well!

I WILL EVENTUALLY upload the pictures to the internet in a MUCH smaller file format without the calendar information, and probably crop them, but you are getting, first hand, all of the artwork in full resolution, which I don't normally dish out. Plus once I run the calendars the first time, that's it! Then they'll be gone forever!So I thank you all in advance for reading this and following the rules. If this all goes smoothly, I am more than happy to continue with the FEMALE version of the calendar after summer!Also just so everyone knows...
The digital calendars will ONLY get sent out once the campaign is over at the end of the 10 days. IT was going to be when I reached the target amount, but I reached that way too soon (not that I'm complaining, lol!) but I haven't finished the pictures yet, so they'll be sent out when all 10 days are up! :D So just bear with me another week and they will be off to you! <3""IN PEACE, VIGILANCEIN WAR, VICTORYIN DEATH, SACRIFICE""--the Grey Warden motto",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Allow me to introduce myself</h2>
<h3>Emerging. Artist.</h3>
Austrian born-and raised, everything I have ever been good at or interested in has been art-related. The moment I could put pen to paper, I started drawing and writing my own stories, winning my first international prize at 13 years old. At age 16, I got in touch with the urban dance scene of Europe. Upon graduating from a high school with a focus in singing and music, I spent half a year travelling to New York and around Europe. In NYC was also where I was introduced to Voguing and Waacking, two dance styles I now teach as one of the pioneers in Austria. I have studied dance in Canada and am currently enrolled in a singing education in Vienna.</div>
<div>For the rest of this year, I have been invited to perform in various countries all over Europe. Though those opportunities are all amazing, I am usually expected to come up for the travel costs and accomodations myself. Together with money for costumes, my endeavour to build working relationships and creating my vision on stage is asking for quite a bit of a budget - a budget I do not yet have.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2>What you get:</h2>
<p>If you decide to support me, you are taking me one step further down the road of becoming an established artist. The festivals I am invited to (for example, Abundance 2013 in Sweden or the MiXer artist residency in Slovenia) give me an opportunity to create and perform original work as well as establishing relationships for future projects. Also, the money will help me recreate my vision on a more polished level than now. And this is how I wanna say THANK YOU:</p>
<ul>
<li>My visual artwork called ""trans:forming beauty"" focuses on the aesthetic of drag queens and transgendered women. You could find a drawing as a personalized postcard in your mailbox!</li>
<li>The fairytale of HanZ and Gretchen, my two stage personas, is told in my voice. Be the first to listen to one of my original songs!!</li>
<li>Have you ever wanted a  private dance class? Personal make-up tips from a drag queen? A one-on-one singing lesson via Skype? Well - here you go!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Please check out the gallery to see more of my work and a taste for how the perks will look like!!</p>

<h2>What you give:</h2>
</div>
<div>If I reach my goal, I will be able to go places I have never been, while sharing my art with a community that has never been exposed to what it is that I am doing. You can help me stand on my own feet as an independent artist and create work in a quality that speaks for itself.</div>

<h3>An Artsy Winter Retreat</h3>
<p> Hello and thank you so much for visiting! My name is Annie Russell; I'm an artist in Charlevoix Michigan working in a variety of mediums, most prominantly acrylics in an impressionistic style depicting landscapes and architecture.</p>
<p>  I have an opportunity to paint in historic St Augustine this winter and I'm very excited at the prospect of working with different styles of flora,fauna,and buildings not to mention the amazing color pallet! I'm even more excited about returning to Northern Michigan to share new techniques and ideas with local artists and students. I need a little help though, and that's where you come in! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need and Why</h3>
<p>Here's the specifics-</p>
<p>   I am asking for $6,500  for the rent of a small house/studio space. This is for the months of January-April. This amount covers the rent and all utilities. The house is furnished and a 10 minute walk to St Augustine's Old Town.</p>
<p>  If the full amount is not collected I will contact the house/studio owner about adjusting the time and/or rental fee. I'm positive that this will not be necessary -- You guys rock and I just know that The Arts and Artists are still important to the health of our communities!</p>
<p>   I plan on using the winter to expand my artistic horizons and learn different techniques at retreats and classes offered in the area and in turn bring these new skills back to Northern Michigan to teach others at monthly workshops. Winters in Northern Michigan and very long and very cold--not at all conducive to insprational endeavors! Please support the arts by supporting an Artist's dream....</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>  My family and I have lived and worked in Northern Michigan for 25 years. We've raised 2 amazing children to young adulthood and I've worked many low wage jobs in order to financially contribute to not only our family, but participation in art festivals and galleries.</p>
<p> The long winters with no sunlight, very little work, and no children to keep me occupied have resulted in <em><strong>a door of opportunity opening</strong></em>; a chance to spend a warmer, lighter winter in St Augustine painting and expanding my artistic soul.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you help?</strong></p>
<p> * When you support one artist you support the greater community of The Arts</p>
<p> * You can get awesome art in exchange</p>
<p> * Helping another person just feels good!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>  Any and all help is appreciated! If you are unable to contribute to my artistic opportunity financially could you please</p>
<p> * Get The Word Out! -- check out the share tools and send my campaign to your friends and to your social media pages</p>
<p>  * Email this link to friends and family that you think may have an interest in contributing to The Arts by way of an individual Artist</p>
<p> * Take a moment and think positive thoughts for me--send those happy vibes out!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Melissa, I'm 21 years old, and I love taking pictures more than doing just about anything else. This is my passion. I'm trying to get to art school to study what I love, but it's proving to be a little bit difficult.</p>
<p>I started taking pictures roughly five years ago, in my sophomore year of high school. I've been hopelessly hooked since then. I started off taking pictures digitally, but in the past year and a half or so, I have completely immersed myself in traditional darkroom photography, which I intend to formally study to the fullest extent that I can.</p>
<p>I specialize in portraiture, nudes and other figurative work. In my pictures, I have a tendency of exploring relatively adult themes (sexuality, fetishism, objectification, oppression, gender roles, etc.) from my own sometimes childlike perspective.</p>
<p>I also use photography to cope with my PTSD and subsequent OCD and anxiety disorder. Through photography, the self-expression that comes with it, and my deep connection to the process of making pictures from shutter click to finished print, I feel a lot happier. :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Around this time last year, I was accepted to a wonderful art college in the Pacific northwest - my dream school, actually. Their curriculum has a strong emphasis on artmaking in many different mediums, and their photography program is deeply film-based.</p>
<p>I made all my necessary preparations: deposits for meal plans and housing were made, financial aid was applied for, necessary items were purchased, and all other things were put in order. There was a large portion of my tuition (about $20,000 dollars for the year) that financial aid was not going to cover, and even though neither I nor my family has enough money to even begin to cover that, I wasn't worried at the time because I was assured getting and dealing with student loans were no problem.</p>
<p>When the time finally came for the loan application, I was denied.</p>
<p>Shocked, I applied again, with a different lender. The same thing happened.</p>
<p>I continued to try to get approved for the loan I needed with different lenders and co-signers, but the same thing continued to happen. As it turns out, it's not as easy getting a student loan as you'd think.</p>
<p>I had to defer my enrollment for two semesters because of this. This upcoming school year, I'm desperate to finally get to my school. I've been working retail jobs and doing whatever I can to get myself closer to this goal. Unfortunately, the community college courses I attend now are sucking up most of my resources as it is, and I need all the help I can get to transfer to my new school this fall!</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">What It'll Take to Get Me There</span></h3>
<p>The $3,000 I have set as my goal will get me through about half a semester of tuition, so I would love to exceed that goal if at all possible! If I finally manage to get the loans I need this year, I will use whatever money I get from this project to pay for housing, art supplies, and the big move up the coast from CA to WA.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of a longshot, but my neighbor suggested I give this a shot to raise money for my tuition, so I figured why not?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where to See My Work</h2>
<p>To see examples of the pictures I take, please take a look at my two medium-specific online portfolios:</p>
<p>Please note that both of the links below contain <strong>artistic depictions of nudity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://citrus--magic.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Digital photography blog</a><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://hornandbone-photo.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Analog photography blog</a></strong></p>
<p>The above links go to the respective blogs I refer to in the perks on the right hand side.</p>
<p><strong>A quick note regarding perks - </strong>A great deal of my work contains nudity and is considered NSFW. If you'd like to take a look at a less adult collection of my work, please look at the gallery on this campaign page. If you'd like to recieve a more SFW, no-nudity image for your perk(s), please let me know ahead of time!</p>

The $3,000 I have set as my goal will get me through about half a semester of tuition, so I would love to exceed that goal if at all possible! If I finally manage to get the loans I need this year, I will use whatever money I get from this project to pay for housing, art supplies, and the big move up the coast from CA to WA.
I know this is kind of a longshot, but my neighbor suggested I give this a shot to raise money for my tuition, so I figured why not?
 
Where to See My Work
To see examples of the pictures I take, please take a look at my two medium-specific online portfolios:
Please note that both of the links below contain artistic depictions of nudity.
Digital photography blog
Analog photography blog
The above links go to the respective blogs I refer to in the perks on the right hand side.
A quick note regarding perks - A great deal of my work contains nudity and is considered NSFW. If you'd like to take a look at a less adult collection of my work, please look at the gallery on this campaign page. If you'd like to recieve a more SFW, no-nudity image for your perk(s), please let me know ahead of time!
 
Thank you so much for your interest in my campaign, and I hope you have a magnificent day!

</div><p></p></div>","Own Way is a contemplation of our desires towards higher goals.  When we choose our life path, we cannot predict where it will lead us.  In the same way we don’t know where the stairways of Own Way will lead until we actually reach the top.The Own Way TeamOwn Way project and team are from Russia.  Each member of our team is a professional in his own sphere – we are architects, engineers, designers, artists, interior decorators, camera operators, writers, translators, event managers, and mischief makers.  Together we create our art.  We have created numerous installations and art objects for festivals in our own country and several Burning Man projects.  You may already know us as the authors of the Cradle of Mir project at Burning Man 2013 and the Russian Library Souk at the 2014 festival.This is Your Own WayMany of us think about these things… We  set goals and have dreams, dreams which become the stars we reach for.  But none of us can tell at the beginning what awaits us at the finish line.  We take risks, make decisions, turn left or right and have the stars decide our destiny. What awaits burners at the end of Own Way’s flight of stairs remains a secret that we must discover on our own.  And if you don’t like what you find there, you can always begin a new ascent – just as in life.What it Looks LikeFive stairways intersect, together forming a pentagram.  We chose this figure for its uniquely ambiguous and enigmatic history.  Over thousands of years, this 5-sided star has accumulated new and different meanings: a powerful and sacred symbol of freedom, a protective ward, a sign of evil, the accursed.  And that history continues – even today each of us finds in it his or her own personal meaning.The rainbow, a symbol that connects heaven and earth, welcomes and beckons burners on our upward journey.  And even at night it will shine and help us rise ever higher. ConstructionOur art object is thirty-eight feet high, built on a foundation sixty-two feet across.  Each of the staircases will rise eighteen feet over the surface of the Playa.Depending upon where you stand, they may be transparent or hidden by the unusual construction of the beams.  The object is an optical illusion, like a mirage in the desert.The object will be one of the tallest at the festival.  It will be constructed mostly of wood.  On Friday, in the last rays of the setting sun, it will burn.What the Money will Go ToThis year, Own Way was awarded a grant from Burning Man.  That grant is extremely important for the project, but in the end it only covers a portion of the materials from which the object will be built.  We will still need to be supplied with numerous power tools, workshops space, wood transport to the Playa, and much more for Own Way to become a reality.  Our expenses are higher yet as we are coming from so far away.We are in real need of the generous support of crowdfunders – of all of you who may themselves eventually walk the stairs of Own Way, anyone who appreciates our vision and would want to see the project built.We are on a long and difficult journey and even the smallest contribution can help us to make the next step.We strongly believe that only together can we create our OWN WAY.

Take a minute to ignore all of the incoming signals and create an outgoing one instead. Produce something. Express yourself in some way. As long as you contribute rather than consume, anything you do can be a work of art.  Open a blank document and start typing. Put pen to paper and sketch a drawing. Grab your camera and take a picture. <strong>Turn up the music and dance</strong>. Start a conversation and make it a good one. Build something. Share something. Craft something. Make more art.

<li>Improves well-being by decreasing negative emotions and increasing positive ones</li>
<li>Researchers found that sustained learning in music and theater correlates strongly with higher achievement in both math and reading.</li>
<li>Improved medical outcomes, trends toward reduced depression</li>
<li>In a study of a high-poverty schools in Chicago, the schools that were participating in the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education (CAPE) made huge strides in closing the gap between high- and low-income students’ academic achievement.</li>
<li>Reductions in stress and anxiety; increases in positive emotions</li>
<li>New brain research shows that not only does music improve skills in math and reading, but it promotes creativity, social development, personality adjustment, and self-worth.</li>

Clear combines ideas from biology, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and more in articles and newsletters written to help people live better lives. In his Make More Art article, posted in the Huffington Post, in Dec of 2016, Clear concluded that one should create more than one consumes.https://azarts.gov/news/new-report-describes-po...There are both physical and mental benefits from creating art, expressing yourself in a tangible way, and sharing something with the world. I’m trying to do more of it each week, and I’d encourage you to do the same.  In our always-on, always-connected world of television, social media, and on-demand everything, it can be stupidly easy to spend your entire day consuming information and simply responding to all of the inputs that bombard your life.  Art offers an outlet and a release from all of that. Take a minute to ignore all of the incoming signals and create an outgoing one instead. Produce something. Express yourself in some way. As long as you contribute rather than consume, anything you do can be a work of art.  Open a blank document and start typing. Put pen to paper and sketch a drawing. Grab your camera and take a picture. Turn up the music and dance. Start a conversation and make it a good one. Build something. Share something. Craft something. Make more art. Your health and happiness will improve and we’ll all be better off for it.https://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/make... Pablo Picasso famously said, “Every child is an artist. The problem is staying an artist when you grow up.” Recent scientific research gives this axiom tangible meaning for older adults by demonstrating that involvement in creative pursuits has a positive effect on physical health, mental health, and social functioning as a person ages, regardless of their ability https://ohioartscouncil.wordpress.com/2014/12/1...  Quincy, founder of the Work of Art Dance Theater (WOA) and subsidiary: Quincy Projects recognized and responded to the above findings over 10 years ago.  As a young performing artist himself, having experienced the life-saving benefit of the arts through dance, theater and music; Quincy founded the 501c (3) Work of Art Dance Theater to bring transformational arts to the central New Jersey community.  The Theater consists of a professional dance company and the Work of Art School of Performing Arts. The school is currently on hiatus due to funding. (Ohhhh-Nooooo!!!) A priority of WOA School of Performing Arts is to ensure the classes in various genres are available to everyone at a fraction of the cost of traditional or competition schools, as the benefits of being involved in the arts are too great to deprive anyone of them.  The dance company is proud to have presented full-length works at: George St. Theater, Crossroads Theater, NJPAC, Westminster Theater at Bloomfield College, Middlesex County College Performing Arts Center, Hamilton Stage - Union County Performing Arts Center, Unitarian Society of Plainfield and Studio 901.  Many of these performances have hosted urban school youth, women of battered shelters and others longing to see Broadway quality productions without access to Broadway funds.

 
Is this stuff for real? Or do people just like to sing and dance so they don’t have to deal with life? IT’S REAL!
The time required to admire, experience or understand and quantify the positive impact of the arts or its influence on people is infinite; we would need to reside in a dimension where we aren’t contained by space and time just to scratch the surface.
The impact of the arts listed below are supported by years of research from Princeton University, American Journal of Public Health, dosomething.org and more.
Students who study art are 4 times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement and 3 times more likely to be awarded for school attendance.
Improves well-being by decreasing negative emotions and increasing positive ones
Researchers found that sustained learning in music and theater correlates strongly with higher achievement in both math and reading.
Improved medical outcomes, trends toward reduced depression
In a study of a high-poverty schools in Chicago, the schools that were participating in the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education (CAPE) made huge strides in closing the gap between high- and low-income students’ academic achievement.
Reductions in stress and anxiety; increases in positive emotions
New brain research shows that not only does music improve skills in math and reading, but it promotes creativity, social development, personality adjustment, and self-worth.
Reductions in distress and negative emotions
Improvements in flow and spontaneity, expression of grief, positive identity, and social networks

Our production team works hand in hand with the Board of Education to allow students to attend free performances as a day class trip, thus turning the production into an educational tool.  We offer a backstage tour and provide the chance for students to speak to the cast and creative team about their lives, their art and the development of the production.Below is clip from one of the most recent workshops: Rutgers Summer Arts Program 2018It’s borderline impossible to ignore the impact and benefits of creative arts to people and youth that have no other outlet for self-expression -- who suffer from stress related to peer pressure, bullying, emotional upheaval within the family structure and involvement in various forms of social media.   It's equally as hard to ignore or question why Federal funding for the arts and humanities rolls in around $250 million a year, while the National Science Foundation is funded at around the $5 billion mark.DONATE TODAY! NO AMOUNT IS TOO SMALL!! Everyone is on a Mission these days! What’s yours? Why are you here?Work of Art Dance Theater MissionSave and change lives through the arts with music, dance and theater; and ensure the power of performing arts is not lost from one generation to the next.We promise to do this by:
Regular classes
Mantra – “I Matter”
I matter and so does my voice. I cannot be silenced. Whether singing or speaking, my message is important.I matter and so does my movement. I cannot be stifled. It tells a story (maybe my story); this is my time to be in control through time, space and shape. When I dance my movement matters.I matter and so does my soul and spirit. The deep internal connection between the two allow me to go places, experience things and explore emotions that may never have been part of my world. Only in the theater can I be anyone and share anything. My soul and spirit matter.The arts matter to me and I matter to the world. I have something special to share.
Pop up (work)shops
Scheduled performances
School assemblies/ presentations
Exposing underprivileged communities and people to the timeless gem of the arts
Quincy “The Artist” Projects MissionSaturate the music industry with hope, positivity and love while creating music to inspire, empower and provoke thoughts of endless possibilities; through a classic, yet neo-futuristic sound.

He was a pioneer in several aspects of the ""medical revolution"" , emphasizing the value of observation in combination with received wisdom. During Paracelsus's lifetime and after his death, he was often celebrated as a wonder healer and investigator of those folk medicines that were rejected by the fathers of medicine (e.g. Galen, Avicenna). It was believed that he had success with his own remedies curing the plague, according to those that revered him. Paracelsus believed that true anatomy could only be understood once the nourishment for each part of the body was discovered. He believed that one must therefore know the influence of the stars on these particular body parts. Diseases were caused by poisons brought from the stars. However, 'poisons' were not necessarily something negative because only the dose determined if a substance was poisonous or not. So if a star or poison caused a disease, then it must be countered by another star or poison, and because everything in the universe was interrelated, beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals, and various chemical combinations thereof. ""Paracelsus' dreams Tarot"" is presented in the form of physician's diary. A powerful magical tool enriched with simbolic alchemical language that contains universal knowledge of the past and future,be it biological evolution or innate psychological processes of the human mind. The flesh and its link with the domain of sacred , interrelations between earthly organisms and stars, anatomy indistinguishable from magic- themes revealed on the edge where scientific and occult are intertwining. Truly,an invitation to apprehend the mysterious immensity of the laws of nature. -""As for the Human Skull. It has 22 bones, it sits at the top of the spinal column. The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters, the 22nd letter, Tav, means Light. At the top of Jacob’s Ladder stood Yahweh, the Light of the world. The light of the body is the eye , says Jesus. 22 is the Number of Light."" (Manly P.

He was a pioneer in several aspects of the ""medical revolution"" , emphasizing the value of observation in combination with received wisdom. During Paracelsus's lifetime and after his death, he was often celebrated as a wonder healer and investigator of those folk medicines that were rejected by the fathers of medicine (e.g. Galen, Avicenna). It was believed that he had success with his own remedies curing the plague, according to those that revered him. Paracelsus believed that true anatomy could only be understood once the nourishment for each part of the body was discovered. He believed that one must therefore know the influence of the stars on these particular body parts. Diseases were caused by poisons brought from the stars. However, 'poisons' were not necessarily something negative because only the dose determined if a substance was poisonous or not. So if a star or poison caused a disease, then it must be countered by another star or poison, and because everything in the universe was interrelated, beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals, and various chemical combinations thereof. ""Paracelsus' dreams Tarot"" is presented in the form of physician's diary. A powerful magical tool enriched with simbolic alchemical language that contains universal knowledge of the past and future,be it biological evolution or innate psychological processes of the human mind. The flesh and its link with the domain of sacred , interrelations between earthly organisms and stars, anatomy indistinguishable from magic- themes revealed on the edge where scientific and occult are intertwining. Truly,an invitation to apprehend the mysterious immensity of the laws of nature. -""As for the Human Skull. It has 22 bones, it sits at the top of the spinal column. The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters, the 22nd letter, Tav, means Light. At the top of Jacob’s Ladder stood Yahweh, the Light of the world. The light of the body is the eye , says Jesus. 22 is the Number of Light."" (Manly P. Hall)

<p>En avril prochain se
tiendra ma 2ème exposition solo entre les murs de l’entreprise montréalaise

!</p>
<p>Afin de mener mon
projet à terme et dans le but de financer celui-ci, j’ai décidé d’associer mon

plan stratégique pour accomplir leur mission repose sur une méthode efficiente
qui a fait <a href=""http://www.75ans.cancer.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>ses preuves</span></a> à maintes reprises.
Deuxièmement, le combat que mène la Société depuis 1938 est en constance
évolution et devient davantage forcené au fil des ans afin d'irradier au mieux
le cancer. J'ai espoir que, dans un futur pas si lointain, chaque cancer ait
son remède miracle.</p>
<p>Également, par cet
événement, je continue une autre de mes missions, soit de rendre l'art
accessible. Quant à ma démarche artistique, elle s'explique par la transparence
de mes émotions qui sont transmises sur des canevas vierges. Les couleurs sont
donc d'une vivacité éclatante tandis que l'aspect abstrait de mes toiles
permettent une unique compréhension pour quiconque, de-là l'accessibilité à
tous. </p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">
<strong>About the Project</strong><span><br class=""kix-line-break""/></span>
</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hi there, my name is LaRae Lobdell and I am the founder of </span><a href=""http://photosister.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>PhotoSister.com</span></a><span> and the artist behind “The Working Artists of Theatre” project.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Theatre Project started 16 months ago in January 2012 when I saw a need to give a new visual representation to the people who make up the theatre industry here in Seattle. I wanted to capture the spirit of the people who have made up Seattle theatre not only during the 2012-2013 years, but also those who have been shaping the industry for 10, 20, 30 and even 40 years. People who shaped the entire city’s art scene ON and OFF the stage.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Since then I have personally photographed over 200 individuals in over 16 theatre companies for free or for a drastically reduced rate. But I didn’t stop with just taking the images. Each artist received a full feature on my internationally recognized blog AND I was able to dedicate my professional skills in social media marketing to create a system where everyone wins: the box office had a rise in ticket sales, the artists were recognized and during this movement - for 16 months - Seattle Theatre was elevated.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>The Impact</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Now that this project has reached it’s end, it is my next goal to celebrate the unification of all the people involved with this project. On June 20th of this year, historic ACT Theatre will be hosting the grand finale of this art project in the form of an all-inclusive event titled “Celebration!”  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This large-scale exhibit of all 200 participants I photographed will be displayed over 3 floors of the historic ACT building in downtown Seattle. This entire exhibit will be on display over the course of an entire theatre-season - through October 17th, 2013 - bringing further connection and elevation to all individuals, community and industry for Seattle’s performing arts.</span></p>
<h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To help me achieve my final goal with the Theatre Project - the “Celebration” Exhibit - I have decided to bring forward this fundraising campaign, my first ever.  The prints and frames alone are thousands of dollars, and this is where you come in!</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>Help me reach my funding Goal of USD $9,000 - net funds will go to:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">Printing, framing and mounting for 200 images ranging from 18”x12” to 30”x45” {$8,275}</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">Marketing materials for on-site display thanking contributors and sponsors {750}</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">If fundraising exceeds the goal, I will be able to enlarge a few of the images beyond the 30”x45” size and have a printed book on display of the entire project (contributors receive a digital copy).</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">If I do not reach the funding goal, the event will still go ahead but scaled down from the initial plan.  </li>
<li dir=""ltr"">I am working closely on my budget with the folks at ACT Theatre to make this an amazing exhibit!</li>
</ul><h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>Your Perks</strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I have AWESOME perks for those of you who are able to contribute to meet this goal in the form of individual or corporate sponsorship.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">Everyone will receive a digital copy of the “Working Artists of Theatre” book by the end of June 2013.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">Other<strong> Individual perks</strong> include signed prints, digital screen savers and name listed at the event and on website event page.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<strong>Corporate Sponsorship is encouraged</strong> as 300-500 people will be in attendance on opening night and <em><strong>thousands</strong></em> of people will walk through the exhibit over the 6-month duration. </li>
<li dir=""ltr"">There are different levels of corporate sponsorship and the perks include logo placement on the website, event pages, email campaigns from both LaRae and ACT Theatre, printed materials at the event, personal lifestyle and editorial shoots, ACTPass memberships, social media mentions and product placement at the event.</li>
</ul><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>How you can be a part</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Choose to click the “Contribute Now” button on the right and select a perk that fits your lifestyle.</span></p>

About the Project

Hi there, my name is LaRae Lobdell and I am the founder of PhotoSister.com and the artist behind “The Working Artists of Theatre” project.
The Theatre Project started 16 months ago in January 2012 when I saw a need to give a new visual representation to the people who make up the theatre industry here in Seattle. I wanted to capture the spirit of the people who have made up Seattle theatre not only during the 2012-2013 years, but also those who have been shaping the industry for 10, 20, 30 and even 40 years. People who shaped the entire city’s art scene ON and OFF the stage.
Since then I have personally photographed over 200 individuals in over 16 theatre companies for free or for a drastically reduced rate. But I didn’t stop with just taking the images. Each artist received a full feature on my internationally recognized blog AND I was able to dedicate my professional skills in social media marketing to create a system where everyone wins: the box office had a rise in ticket sales, the artists were recognized and during this movement - for 16 months - Seattle Theatre was elevated.
 
The Impact
Now that this project has reached it’s end, it is my next goal to celebrate the unification of all the people involved with this project. On June 20th of this year, historic ACT Theatre will be hosting the grand finale of this art project in the form of an all-inclusive event titled “Celebration!”  
This large-scale exhibit of all 200 participants I photographed will be displayed over 3 floors of the historic ACT building in downtown Seattle. This entire exhibit will be on display over the course of an entire theatre-season - through October 17th, 2013 - bringing further connection and elevation to all individuals, community and industry for Seattle’s performing arts.
 
What I Need & What You Get
To help me achieve my final goal with the Theatre Project - the “Celebration” Exhibit - I have decided to bring forward this fundraising campaign, my first ever.  The prints and frames alone are thousands of dollars, and this is where you come in!
Help me reach my funding Goal of USD $9,000 - net funds will go to:

Printing, framing and mounting for 200 images ranging from 18”x12” to 30”x45” {$8,275}
Marketing materials for on-site display thanking contributors and sponsors {750}
If fundraising exceeds the goal, I will be able to enlarge a few of the images beyond the 30”x45” size and have a printed book on display of the entire project (contributors receive a digital copy).
If I do not reach the funding goal, the event will still go ahead but scaled down from the initial plan.  
I am working closely on my budget with the folks at ACT Theatre to make this an amazing exhibit!
Your Perks
I have AWESOME perks for those of you who are able to contribute to meet this goal in the form of individual or corporate sponsorship.

Everyone will receive a digital copy of the “Working Artists of Theatre” book by the end of June 2013.
Other Individual perks include signed prints, digital screen savers and name listed at the event and on website event page.

Corporate Sponsorship is encouraged as 300-500 people will be in attendance on opening night and thousands of people will walk through the exhibit over the 6-month duration. 
There are different levels of corporate sponsorship and the perks include logo placement on the website, event pages, email campaigns from both LaRae and ACT Theatre, printed materials at the event, personal lifestyle and editorial shoots, ACTPass memberships, social media mentions and product placement at the event.

Executive Director of Equinox Village informed me that the art show opening
this coming May in Manchester, VT was not a group show as I had been told, but
rather all for me to create and run with. 
Given I have primarily worked as a decorative painter in
order to support myself, this opportunity to share my fine art is a dream come
true.  For the first time, I intend to exhibit some of my
large acrylic abstracts, my more recent Big-Brush paintings mounted as scrolls,
two walls of my photographs, and two of my videos of “Painting with the Five
Elements”.</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/463133/files/20140326195341-Five_Elements_in_One.jpg?1395888821"" src="""" style=""width: 363.34352941176473px; height: 503px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>Although I majored in
“Illustration” in art school to be practical, painting intuitively is what
really floats my boat because of it being entirely inner-directed.  Inspired by the highly imaginative and refined
work of Ahmed Yacoubi, I have almost always preferred this
process of letting a spontaneous brushstroke or color begin the unpredictable
development of the end subject and feeling. 
For some inexplicable reason rendering the imagined, invisible realms proves more satisfying for me than
rendering the external, literal world.  Having
been introduced to Big-Brush painting four years ago opened this process even
further, allowing me to relinquish even more of the interference of my left
brain, yielding a direct hit of undiluted energy, communicating viscerally v.s.
rationally.  In my case, as in Chinese
philosophy, I believe this energy or “Chi” is the pure essence of life and love
itself, translated through each of us as infinitely unique and complex
forms.  Therefore, I have decided the

Executive Director of Equinox Village informed me that the art show opening
this coming May in Manchester, VT was not a group show as I had been told, but
rather all for me to create and run with. 
Given I have primarily worked as a decorative painter in
order to support myself, this opportunity to share my fine art is a dream come
true.  For the first time, I intend to exhibit some of my
large acrylic abstracts, my more recent Big-Brush paintings mounted as scrolls,
two walls of my photographs, and two of my videos of “Painting with the Five
Elements”.                            
Although I majored in
“Illustration” in art school to be practical, painting intuitively is what
really floats my boat because of it being entirely inner-directed.  Inspired by the highly imaginative and refined
work of Ahmed Yacoubi, I have almost always preferred this
process of letting a spontaneous brushstroke or color begin the unpredictable
development of the end subject and feeling. 
For some inexplicable reason rendering the imagined, invisible realms proves more satisfying for me than
rendering the external, literal world.  Having
been introduced to Big-Brush painting four years ago opened this process even
further, allowing me to relinquish even more of the interference of my left
brain, yielding a direct hit of undiluted energy, communicating viscerally v.s.
rationally.  In my case, as in Chinese
philosophy, I believe this energy or “Chi” is the pure essence of life and love
itself, translated through each of us as infinitely unique and complex
forms.  Therefore, I have decided the
name of this exhibition is:  “What Art in
Heaven?  An Exhibition of Paintings,
Photographs and Videos in Praise of Life on Earth”.                                            This
campaign is a daring (and uncomfortable) effort to ask for the funding to cover
the expenses of producing this exhibition: the cost of framing, designing the invitation, printing the photographs, postcards, and posters, postage, producing one more video in

travail de réalisatrice et maintenant d'artiste est une réflexion
sur les relations humaines. Le projet « Moi & nous » est
l'aboutissement concret d'une démarche commencée il y a trois ans
sur les réseaux sociaux.
Mon
travail consiste à photographier et filmer des rencontres qui ont
émané des réseaux sociaux. 420 derrières de têtes d'amis
Facebook, une collection de 600 photos reçues divisées par thème,
une série de nus anonymes commencés sur Instagram (avant de se
faire bannir), des secrets dévoilés en cachette par près de 80 personnes, une chaîne d'objets troqués parmi des gens qui ne se
sont jamais rencontrés. Là il est temps d'amener tout dans le réel.
D'imprimer ses centaines de photos, d'étaler les objets, de vivre
les réseaux, de donner corps à des liens Facebook, à des échanges
Instagram, des rencontres Craigslist. 

Cette
expérience doit devenir concrète et sortir du monde virtuel, en
regroupant ces liens dans le réel, en devenant des objets. Il est
temps de faire une exposition à Montréal.
Parce
qu'en fin d'exercice, c'est en débordant dans le réel que le
virtuel trouve son sens. 

Je
le fais pour moi, je le fais pour nous.
Tous ces projets existent présentement sur les réseaux sociaux et dans l'ordinateur. Convertir tout ça dans le réel coûte de l'argent. Je veux récolter 15 0000 $ pour imprimer, installer, relier, monter, projeter. Afin que nous puissions, ensemble, intégrer les réseaux, pour vrai. Tous
les donateurs recevront un cadeau en guise d'appréciation et un reçu
de dons à une organisation culturelle reconnue au Québec
(déductible d'impôt).

Notes
sur l'artiste
Sophie Lambert travaille dans le domaine de la photographie, de la vidéo,
du documentaire et des réseaux sociaux. Ses œuvres questionnent le
corps et l'identité tant dans sa valeur individuelle qu’universelle.
Sa démarche est  systématiquement collaborative.
Elle
pose un regard sur notre société, sur nos façons de rentrer en
contact avec les autres, sur l'image qu'on dévoile publiquement et
sur nos facettes plus cachées. Elle utilise les réseaux sociaux
pour rassembler les gens, tous ces utilisateurs de réseaux sociaux,
seuls, derrière leurs écrans. Elle leur propose une expérience
commune et rassembleuse. Elle invite les gens à se prêter à des
exercices révélant leurs réalités et encourageant certains à
sortir de leur zone de confort.  

Le
résultat donne une fresque de l'expérience contemporaine, tant
celle de l'individu que de la collectivité.Sa
série 5

consiste en 5 grands assemblages de plus de 100 photos. Les photos ont
été envoyées via les réseaux sociaux suite à l’appel de
l’artiste.Cent

Financing for ""I & US"" My work as a documentary director, and now as an artist, is a reflexion on human relationships. The project ""I and Us"" is the culmination of a project begun three years ago on social media.My work consists of photographed and filmed encounters that have come to life through social media. Four hundred and twenty (420) backs of heads of Facebook friends; a collection of 600 photos divided into themes; a suite of anonymous nudes begun on Instagram (before being banned); the secrets of 100 people; and a series of objects exchanged between people who have never met.

Now it's time to bring these projects to life, under one roof together, these hundreds of virtual relationships; to give form to Facebook contacts, to Instagram moments, and to Craigslist encounters.   This is the moment to bring the project into focus, to print hundreds of photos, to display the objects, to experience the network, to actually see the artwork, to be in real time – to move virtual reality into physical reality.
Now we must put together an art
exhibition in Montreal.
I'm doing it for myself, but I'm doing it for us.



All these projects exist on social media and in my computer. To move them to the real work will take money. I need to raise 15 000 $ to print, install, bind, mount and project. 

This exhibition is a way to demonstrate that only by going beyond the digital mode does virtual reality make any sense. 

Along the same lines as these collective art projects, I invite people to donate as a means to finance the exhibition. As a token of my appreciation, I will offer gifts and artwork with a tax receipt for a donation to a cultural organization recognized in Quebec
(tax deductible). 


About the artist

Sophie Lambert works with photography, film and social media. Her artworks are a study of the individual and collective values of body and identity. Her process is systematically collaborative. 

 She looks with detachment at our society, at the ways we enter into contact with each other, at the image we reveal publicly and at other more hidden sides. All these users of social media are alone, behind their screens; she proposes to bring them together. She invites these people to reveal themselves, their private reality and let themselves move beyond their comfort zone.

The result is a tableau of contemporary society, of the individual and of the group.


The suite, The 5 senses, contains 5 large collections of more than 100 photos each. The photos were sent via social media following the artist’s instructions. 



100 Bodies is a collection of 100 photos of anonymous nudes. The project was originally housed on Instagram until the artist was banned from the network for this project. 



Confessional II presents posters of anonymously received secrets exhibited around the city and rephotographed.The suite the Other Side of the Face(book), is a collection of photographs of the backs of heads of the artist's Facebook friends and famous people she encounters.  

The six second body
presents short videos in which 150 people agreed to expose one part of their body; the video sequences are joined into a loop so that the image of a single body emerges.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Based out of San Francisco, featuring artists from San Francisco State University, <em>Holloway</em> is a high quality, biannual, full-color, rigorously juried, printed publication. This way we will be able to showcase talented young artists twice a year — undergoing the same processes employed by galleries and museums. Currently there is no form, printed or otherwise, of connecting the artists who have received education from SFSU to the wider Bay Area community. Our intention is to develop a dialogue between an overshadowed yet highly successful department and its urban surroundings in an extremely polished format rivaling other high profile publications with a political undertone regarding the overvaluation of private universities and art schools above public education. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding we receive from this campaign will go directly into the publication of issue one. We have two options in printing:</p>
<p>1) Less than what we are asking for (about $900 less).</p>
<p>This path will allow us to print the magazine without all the bells and whistles. Now, don't get us wrong, the magazine will still be beautiful at this level. We just have a few things in mind that we believe could make the magazine even more stunning...</p>
<p>2) More than what we are asking for (about $900 more).</p>
<p>If we are to obtain more funding than the $5,000 we are asking for, we will be able to print the magazine in an extremely delicate, refined, and polished manner. This is our upper tier, everything-we-could-hope-for-and-imagine kind of quality. </p>
<p>Either way, Holloway will become a reality and it will be thanks to you. Our aim is to fund the production of issue one entirely through our community. This is something we can all be proud of. </p>
<p>Should we make enough for option one, but just not enough for option two, the leftover funds will go into our distribution and outreach - shipping the magazine to all kinds of venues around the world. If we make even more than enough to print option two, well, just imagine how Holloway could be sustained. This is a biannual magazine, so start dreaming about issue two!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our aim is exposure. Exposure of a very alternative education, as seen through the dominant ethos of contemporary society. We want to showcase talent regardless of prestige, to work from the ground up within our community, presenting critical artwork and suggesting pathways. The narrative in the United States of assuming tens of thousands of dollars of debt in order to attend a school hopeful students believe will place them into a job or sphere they love is tired and unsustainable. For this reason, <em>Holloway</em> serves as a model, a microcosm of a larger problem stemming from a massively creative section of California. </p>
<p>We are currently in the process of jurying over thirty-five artists from our first round of submissions. Some of these artists have just finished obtaining their degrees from SFSU, others have been working for years in varying photographic fields post-graduation. All remain passionate about the education they received under the tutelage of engaging, demanding professors.</p>
<p>Submissions ranged from the Bay Area, to New York, to Montreal. The focus of each artist was refined and clear, working complex ideas deconstructed within abstraction, studio portraiture, landscape, darkroom alterations, diptychs, murals, contact prints, and everything in between. As the story goes, most of this work ends up stored away under beds or rolled up into tubes to be thought of fleetingly by the creator. We have already been in communication with local (and national) independent bookstores and have methods of distribution in place post-publication.</p>
<p>Independent of funding from the university, our intention is to remain an autonomous organization responding to creation biannually. As we extend our branches to reach others who have passed through SFSU, our coverage will grow, and the extent to which these artists have flourished will be understood. Due to our model and philosophy, creation may continue ad infinitum. The half-year spent developing <em>Holloway</em> until now has proven there is great interest in the Bay Area and otherwise to see our artists’ work. What is needed next is you.</p>

<p>The BFA senior thesis show is what students work for their entire scholastic experience. Karl, Jess and Michaela are three senior photography students at the University of Hartford trying to fund their senior thesis show. Costs will included, materials, framing and food or beverage available at the opening. The show acts as a final push from the school and a debut into the art world.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE ARTISTS:</strong></p>
<p>Michaela Boscoe is an artist working in cyanotypes at the Hartford Art School. Cyanotypes are a non-silver photographic process in which iron reacts with UV rays and when develops is a prussian blue color. Using the cyanotype Michaela began exploring the organic forms of trees in her senior year. She uses sawdust as well as other wooden materials to create tree-like forms on the cyanotype-covered paper. The result of this exploration is a white tree form on a prussian blue background. There is no negative made in the process of her trees and therefore each print is a unique, one-of-a-kind, handmade piece.</p>
<p>Karl Mattson is a photography student with an emphasis in creating journeys of fiction, non-fiction and narrative stream of consciousness through an abstracted documentary visual style. He is currently enrolled at the Hartford Art School for his BFA in Photography, with a minor in Printmaking. His current project, titled This Is Me Saying Goodbye, abstractly documents his psychosocial inner world during the journey of mystery, pleasure and collapse of emotions within a past relationship. Embracing a new beginning from an end, his project sees him marking the end by saying goodbye to the after-image of the past relationship.</p>
<p>Jess Emonds is a senior photography student at the Hartford Art School. Her focus is on light and how it affects spaces. The series allows her to further investigate light, as well as become more familiar with the space she lives in. Light finds her. When she goes in search of light, it fades too quickly. Photography relies on light to live. Without light there would be no photograph. Light is constantly changing, as is the medium of photography. Technology persistently shapes our perceptions of the image. As new technology is introduced into the medium of photography, old ideals are pushed out. Film is fleeting, as is light. Jess uses a 4x5 field camera, itself a homage to the beginning of photography. The camera allows light to become tangible. We cannot hold light in our hands, but we can feel it on our faces. Film is an object. With the 4x5 camera, light also becomes an object in the form of the photograph.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways you can help:</strong></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can donate, but we appreciate your support in sharing our project with your friends, family and coworkers. We are very excited about this and hope that you are too! Thank you for your support.</p>

<p><strong>What is this fundraiser for?</strong></p>
<p>A group exhibition called <strong><em>War is for the Living </em></strong></p>
<p>Curated by Chuong-Dai Vo and Midori Yamamura</p>
<p>Opening reception: February 14, 2013, 6pm-9pm</p>
<p>On view: February 14-March 23, 2013, Tuesday-Saturday 11am-5pm</p>
<p>Sylvia Wald and Po Kim Gallery, 417 Lafayette Street, New York City</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the exhibition about?</strong></p>
<p>The show features installation art, sculpture, films, prints and photographs by 11 artists. These projects are about the relationships and histories formed in times of war, the displacements that people go through, and the humanity that survives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this exhibition important?</strong></p>
<p>We are living in a time of increased militarization of the U.S. and unending war, especially in the Middle East. At the same time, people across the region are demanding a right to shape their own governments and societies. This exhibition speaks to these events.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Since we started this campaign, we've raised 75% of our goal! We've received sponsorship from <strong>Japan Foundation, </strong>NYU's Asian/Pacific/American Institute, and the Vilchek. We've also received an equipment loan from NYU's APA and in-kind labor for the brochure design and installation. Please donate and help us cover the rest of the costs of the exhibition!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if I can't contribute money, but can offer in-kind help?</strong></p>
<p>We are volunteering our labor to do this show, and would love to have help to put it up! Please contact us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who are the artists in the exhibition?</strong></p>
<p>The video and gallery tab has images of most of the works that will be in the show. This is a brief snynopsis of the works:</p>
<p><strong>Simon Leung</strong>'s video/sculpture <em>War After War</em> is a collaboration with his subject, Warren Niesluchowski, a former World War II refugee and Vietnam War deserter whose life foregrounds the ethical challenge of reciprocity and hospitality. <strong>Hiroshi Sunairi</strong>’s <em>Tree Project Film</em> features an interview with a tree doctor who cares for trees that survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and who gives the seeds from these trees to people who will plant them. <strong>An-My Le</strong>’s <em>Events Ashore</em> project show the larger world of the U.S. military, its scientific, exploratory and humanitarian missions. <strong>Allan deSouza</strong>’s <em>Cityscapes</em> are images of urban landscapes made of material he scavenged from the streets of lower Manhattan in the spring of 2001. Made shortly before 9/11, the images are hauntingly prophetic of that event. <strong>Paul Qaysi</strong> is presenting a new series of photographs called <em>Misprint</em>. Printed on the reverse side of the inkjet paper, the images engage with the misperceptions that lead to military attacks on civilians and our own blindness to the effects of war on ourselves. <strong>Nina Berman</strong>’s photographic series <em>Homeland</em> examines the militarization of American life post 9/11, in particular the burgeoning security state and its influence on national and personal identity. <strong>Yoshiaki</strong><strong> Kaihatsu</strong> will install a floor piece called <em>Dust</em>, which comprises debris he collected near the 9/11 Ground Zero site. Made during the Vietnam War, <strong>Yoko Ono</strong>’s public art project, <em>WAR IS OVER! If You Want It </em>is as relevant for the current time as it was three decades ago. <strong>Dinh Q. Lê</strong>’s hand embroidery <em>The Texture of Memory</em> and photoweavings remember the dead of the Cambodian Genocide. Performance artist <strong>Nancy Hwang</strong> will invite artists and audience members to share their stories and memories of lives affected by war. <strong>Tomie Arai</strong>' silk screens encapsulate the theme of the show in her use of the folk tale <em>Momotaro</em>, to tell a story of the internment of Japanese Americans and their journeys of survival, hope and possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will the contributions go toward?</strong></p>
<p>Your support will help us pay for material and equipment, transportation and delivery of the art work, and installation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are the contributions tax deductible?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Sylvia Wald and Po Kim Art Gallery Foundation is a non-profit 501(c). The contributions will be sent to the gallery to be used only for the costs of this exhibition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the contribution perks?</strong></p>
<p>The artists are making works specifically for this occasion, and they will not be available beyond the fundraiser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there a shipping cost?</strong></p>
<p>We will cover the costs of shipping in the U.S. For other countries, the costs will be US$10-15.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the Dinner Guest and the House Guest contribution perks?</strong></p>
<p>The Dinner Guest and House Guest gifts are two new works that extend Simon Leung's video/sculpture <em>War After War</em> in its contemplation of what it means to be a displaced person, what it means to be hospitable, who gets to be hospitable, and what it means to form reciprocal relationships.</p>
<p>For the Dinner Guest gift, the contributor(s) may buy or cook Warren Niesluchowski a meal in a city, town, or any place where Warren may find himself. For the House Guest gift, the contributor may put Warren Niesluchowski up for no less than 1 night, and no more than 3 nights, at the contributor’s home in a city, town, or a place where Warren may find himself, pending Warren's agreement. The contributor must agree to negotiate specific terms with Warren upon a successful bid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who are the curators?</strong></p>
<p>Chuong-Dai Vo is an independent curator and writer based in NYC and a Visiting Scholar at MIT. Midori Yamamura is a lecturer at Museum of Modern Art in NYC and a Visiting Assistant Professor in History of Art and Design at Pratt Institute. We are guest curating this group exhibition for the Sylvia Wald and Po Kim Gallery in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who founded the gallery?</strong></p>
<p>Sylvia Wald was a politically and socially conscious artist who fought against racial inequalities during her lifetime. Po Kim was born in Korea under Japanese colonialism, and had to endure political persecution during the post-World War II formation of South Korea. He was able to leave for the U.S. on a fellowship in the 1950s, and eventually came to NYC. He and Sylvia Wald created this nonprofit art gallery to show works of social importance. Po Kim is 95-years-old and continues to paint on a regular basis.</p>

<p><strong>We thank you for your support, and hope to see you at the exhibition opening in February 2013.</strong></p>

Po Kim was born in Korea under Japanese colonialism, and had to endure political persecution during the post-World War II formation of South Korea. He was able to leave for the U.S. on a fellowship in the 1950s, and eventually came to NYC. He and Sylvia Wald created this nonprofit art gallery to show works of social importance. Po Kim is 95-years-old and continues to paint on a regular basis.

We have been creating life size reproductions of our waterbird sculptures for the last 15 years . We have had great times and slow times and this is the latter. The reason for this campaign is to raise money to get Cindy a hysterectomy surgery. She has a lot of scar tissue built up from having endometriosis and it is causing her more and more pain.                                                                                                                            We have no insurance so I am trying to raise the money to get her treated. The money you send will make a tremendous impact on her life she currently is unable to work or do any kind of strenuous activity. Seeing her in pain and feeling helpless to stop it is something that kills me . Her Dr. said she needs this surgery as soon as possible that was over a year ago and her pain has gotten steadily worse to this point . We have plenty of art so if you can help we will give back to you with our art.                                                                                                           <strong>WHERE THE MONEY GOES                                                                                       </strong>So here is what we need the money for . $4000 for the surgery and $1000 for a previous emergency room bill that we must pay. Any funds over this amount will go towards future healthcare and insurance. If anyone knows of a good Gyno/surgeon within 500 miles of Port Charlotte Fl. that can do it cheaper we would like to know that too. Your financial help will save a life and that is the greatest gift you can give. 26 years ago I saved my sisters life with a kidney donation and that was the greatest feeling I have ever felt, it is truly indescribable.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story - a real Investment in Art

We are a group of 30 UK artists who have been selected to exhibit at the prestigious Orange County Centre for Contemporary Art, bringing some of the UK’s top emerging artists to California. (Dec 21st – Jan 12th).

The list of artists reads like a who’s who of the young, London art scene, including Rosie Emerson, Tahnee Lonsdale, and Agnetha Sjogren. Works by these and other collectible artists are available to you here as part of the fundraising campaign: Our 'perks' in return for your donations are listed to the right, or we have opened an online shop here with more range: http://www.etsy.com/shop/LondonCalifornia

We are a very talented group, pushing the boundaries of the art world even in a time when it is hard to get arts funding to make shows like this happen. To enable the first Museum show of the London art scene in California, we need your help.


The Impact



This is a very exciting and potentially career expanding opportunity for all the artists that have been selected, and will also enable us to help raise support for OCCCA which develops and actively participates in public educational, outreach and community art services. 
Your contributions, big or small, will be helping on many levels.


We are not just shipping work to California – we are providing an interactive, performative presence. We will be turning heads! In order to achieve this we are aiming for as many of us as possible to travel to the show.

What We Need & What You Get


We would love for you to help make this possible - and as we are an extremely talented bunch of lovely artists we have some incredible ""perks"" to let you know grateful we are for your help!


The artists have kindly donated some stunning art pieces which can be yours if you contribute to this campaign. These artworks are usually at least twice the ‘contribution price’ listed here, so this is really an incredible opportunity to get some original artworks for a fraction of the price – a very rare opportunity with this calibre of artist, and it is only possible for the duration of this campaign. (Any works not claimed will be returning to their original price). More details below.



 

The closer you help us get to our funding target of $9000 (£5000), the more of us will actually be able to get over there and give a taste of British art to California, as well as ship the artwork.


Details:  What we have for you


Firstly we are offering limited edition artwork postcards signed by the artists. 50 of each design will be created to make up this exclusive collection.

Now that's pretty good in itself but we have a really incredible opportunity for you as well: All the artists are offering original works of art! This is a fantastic chance to own artwork from these successful emerging artists –  each very talented and collectible. Currently exhibiting in London and represented by Notting Hill based gallery Debut Contemporary, we have all successfully shown in other locations as well.


A few of the places the artists have exhibited: The Venice Biennale, Tate Britain, Tate Modern, The Southbank Centre, Sommerset House, and galleries in Singapore, LA, Russia, Salzburg, Austria, Germany and Poland. Collectors of their work are in many countries and include Banksy and Bill Woodrow. They have worked with clients such as Jerry Lewis and Groove Armada and have had work auctioned by high profile Christies auctioneer Hugh Edmeades. 



 
This is a wonderful way to get a piece of collectable contemporary art whilst supporting the artists in furthering their careers! Its not just a donation to us, it's also an art investment for you!

We are also offering exciting opportunities like commissioning your portrait for £150 or joining us at a Salon Dinner Party with London's top emerging artists. More info here: http://nicolaanthony.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/join-us-at-a-salon-dinner-party-with-the-artists/

</div><p>We are an upcoming theatre troupe preparing to stage
the longest running play of all time <b><i>‘The Mousetrap’</i> by Agatha Christie</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>About <i>‘The Mousetrap’</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>‘The Mousetrap’ by Agatha Christie opened in the West
End of London in 1952, and has been running continuously since then. It is by
far the longest initial run of any play in history, with its 25,000<sup>th</sup>performance
taking place on 18<sup>th</sup>November 2012. It is the longest running show
(of any type) of the modern era. The play is also known for its twist ending,
which the audiences are traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the
theatre.</p>
<p>The play starts with a group of strangers stranded in
a boarding house during a snow storm, one of whom is a murderer. The suspects
include the newly married couple who run the house, and the suspicions in their
minds nearly wreck their perfect marriage. Others are a spinster with a curious
background, an architect who seems better equipped to be a chef, a retired army
major, a strange little man who claims his car has overturned in a drift, and a
jurist who makes life miserable for everyone. Into their midst comes a
policemen, traveling on skis. On the very next day, the Jurist is killed. Two
down and one to go, to get to the rationale of the murderer’s pattern, the
policemen probes the background of everyone present, and rattles a lot of
skeletons. Another famous Agatha Christie switch finish. The excitement never
lets up and the search for the murderer never ceases which keeps the audience
at the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>The show is designed, choreographed &amp; directed by
Kevin Cruze and will be presented by Cold Theatre 7 featuring exemplary

the longest running play of all time ‘The Mousetrap’ by Agatha Christie.

About ‘The Mousetrap’

‘The Mousetrap’ by Agatha Christie opened in the West
End of London in 1952, and has been running continuously since then. It is by
far the longest initial run of any play in history, with its 25,000thperformance
taking place on 18thNovember 2012. It is the longest running show
(of any type) of the modern era. The play is also known for its twist ending,
which the audiences are traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the
theatre.
The play starts with a group of strangers stranded in
a boarding house during a snow storm, one of whom is a murderer. The suspects
include the newly married couple who run the house, and the suspicions in their
minds nearly wreck their perfect marriage. Others are a spinster with a curious
background, an architect who seems better equipped to be a chef, a retired army
major, a strange little man who claims his car has overturned in a drift, and a
jurist who makes life miserable for everyone. Into their midst comes a
policemen, traveling on skis. On the very next day, the Jurist is killed. Two
down and one to go, to get to the rationale of the murderer’s pattern, the
policemen probes the background of everyone present, and rattles a lot of
skeletons. Another famous Agatha Christie switch finish. The excitement never
lets up and the search for the murderer never ceases which keeps the audience
at the edge of their seats.
The show is designed, choreographed & directed by
Kevin Cruze and will be presented by Cold Theatre 7 featuring exemplary
performances by a range of actors.The performances will be held at the Lionel
Wendt Theatre, Colombo 7, Sri Lanka on the 30th, 31st
January & 1stFebruary 2015 from 7.30pm with an additional
matinee performance on 1stFebruary.

</div></div>","Cindy was a visual artist, a friend, daughter and big sister. Creation was her calling. When she wasn’t working in esteemed museums like MoMA or MOCA, she was making videos, photographing, designing, drawing and inspiring friends to follow their creative passions.  Cindy Yeh left us too early leaving many projects unfinished. Among those projects was a zine called “Urban Velocity,” a love letter to the energy of New York created in collaboration with her friends.She had been folding the first 10 copies of the zine the morning of the accident. The copies were not perfect—the printer created an unattractive big white margin in the middle of the booklet. However, Cindy was proud with this first attempt. She knew that with a couple more tries, the perfect print would have been soon shared among friends and art spaces, spreading her love of creation.The people who worked on the project, and people who've known Cindy and her talent, would want all want her creations to go on. Through her work, Cindy will always be present with us.To honor Cindywe're hoping to create 300 professional prints of her zine, “Urban Velocity.” The copies will be shared with friends, family, strangers, art spaces, zine and book fairs on both the East and West coasts. We're hoping that you might find it in your hearts to contribute any sum you can afford to our fundraiser. Radix Media in Brooklyn, the city’s only worker-owned union print shop, will making our prints for us. The zine will come in a booklet format with saddle stitching binding the 52 pages together. The cover and back pages will be made of #80 cardstock and the interior will be #60 cardstock, both uncoated. The zine itself contains photography, personal essays, stories, drawings and more ways a group of friends have express their love for the speed of a city that never sleeps. Radix will charge us $835.00 for 300 prints. This is a pretty good price but we’ll need help from friends, family, zine fanatics and people that want to preserve Cindy’s legacy. Shipping the copies will then be the second main expense. We’re counting on the financial support from people interested in zines and art books. Even if you can only donate a few dollars that will help our cause.  We plan to charge a small amount of $4 per zine in festivals and bookstores.

<h3>Nine <br/>Dragon <br/>Heads </h3>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>Nine Dragon Heads aspires to generate positive environmental and spiritual legacies for the future. This is in a context where humankind benefits from manipulating and dominating its natural surroundings; regarding the natural environment as a target and challenge for conquest, a test of its ability to transform and possess nature. </p>
<p>Our desire and ingenuity to exploit and develop the natural environment through domination and control implies superiority. Reflecting on the history of the planet however, many species of all forms became extinct when the friendly environmental conditions that firstly nurtured their birth later changed and became hostile. </p>
<p>The question of when will humankind disappear hangs over us. No matter how 'special' we Homo Sapiens think we may be, we have to realise we are a part of the greater natural world and the product of a unique environment that supports our life. </p>
<p>How can we lead a life with understanding and respect for the world of nature? How can we maintain a life peacefully and fairly for the survival of mankind? </p>
<p>Nine Dragon Heads changes ‘I’ into ‘we’, a community of artists, who explore and re-consider the relationship and equilibrium between people and the natural environment. </p>
<p>Nine Dragon Heads joins with other communities to share their imagination, experience and ideas through creative art practices, to reveal and celebrate both diverse and common consciousness and to further co-operation. </p>
<p>Nine Dragon Heads aims to further greater understanding of human nature and the world through restorative creative action and engagement and in so doing aims to leave a healthier environment - the heritage of the future - to posterity. </p>

<h3>“DMZ &amp; JSA"" 2019<br/>Art Politic-Border Crossing ONSAEMIRO</h3>
<p>""DMZ &amp; JSA” is the fourth project from the Nine Dragon Heads' series of events that emphasize a new component in NDH’s current activity. It is working on the subjects of mutual influences and connections between a art event and the geography of its realization, a international art politic, and a large-scale art event with a fixed location and periodicity. Alongside the usual mode of NDH such as open-air symposiums, research-oriented workshops, exhibitions and conferences, these projects will be held in the Demilitarized Zone and Joint Sceurity Area (DMZ &amp; JSA), the 155mile from West to East Borderline that divides the North and South Korea, and will be realised through both an exhibition and research presentation at the Suwon Museum of Art, Experimental Space UZ, Space NOON. </p>
<p>The research destination of DMZ is a weapons-free buffer zone between North and South Korea. The area was established on July 27, 1953 when the Armistice Agreement was signed during the Korean War, and created a the 2km-wide stretch of land both north and south of the demarcation line. The DMZ extends largely from Gyeonggi-do to Gangwon-do, includes seven different cities and smaller counties of Paju, Yeoncheon, Cheorwon, Hwacheon, Yanggu, Inje and Goseong. As a results, The zone has been protected from human disturbance for the last six decades and has unintentionally become a haven for wildlife. </p>
<p>With the project ""DMZ &amp; JSA"" Nine Dragon Heads continues its journey on important geographic routes and the locations of special environmental, cultural and historical significance. Working within the DMZ &amp; JSA will be especially rewarding for the NDH artists-researchers for several reasons. </p>
<p>As a multimedia art project, ""DMZ &amp; JSA"" will examine the complexity of environmental and social issues as well as the political, geographic, historical, and cultural aspects of the DMZ &amp; JSA. This will be presented through an Archive Show and include installation, video, sculpture, photography, and performance. </p>
<p>The title ""Border Crossing ONSAEMIRO"" refers to an artistic investigation of the nature of borders. On the one hand, the title underlines the vital importance of something happening inside the restricted and exceptional environment of the DMZ &amp; JSA, while on the other it offers the possibility of going outside the visible or hidden limits - not only physically, but also intellectually, in order to research differences and commonalities that can be found at the DMZ &amp; JSA . </p>
<p>“DMZ &amp; JSA” presents the works of the International Environmental Art Symposium - Nine Dragon Heads. Nine Dragon Heads is an interdisciplinary platform where artists from across the 5 continents work in locations that may be environmentally, economically or politically troubled, following important cultural, historical and geopolitical routes. Initiated in South Korea in 1995 in response to the destruction of an important historical site, Nine Dragon Heads has evolved to address varying crises and transitory situations in localized and situation-specific ways. The title of the project “Border Crossing ONSAEMIRO” refers to the inherently spontaneous nature of the International Environmental Art Symposium which will react to the particular geographic and environmental situation of the DMZ &amp; JSA 2019. The project accompanied by an exhibition of working traces, artifacts and performances from within the DMZ at the Suwon Museum of Art, Space UZ , Space NOON from 22th, Sept to 5th, OCT, 2019.</p>
<p>“DMZ &amp; JSA” brings together site-specific work, installation, video, sculpture, photography and performance. It synthesizes and facilitates joint and individual works, while threads of overlapping artistic inquiry are produced in a process of evolving collaborative association. Participating artists do not aim to place full stops or to answer specific questions. Rather, they look for the creation of a space where experimental open air and public art-practice results in an ethical artistic message. </p>
<p>“DMZ &amp; JSA ”is not supported by any formal umbrella institution or major foundation. The majority of organizational functions are implemented directly by the Nine Dragon Heads participating artists, with directorial overview and coordination provided by Park Byoung Uk, the project’s artistic director.</p>
<p>“DMZ &amp; JSA” is organized in collaboration with the SHUROOP art group and dedicated to the support and promotion of contemporary visual arts. The project is curated by Magda Guruli.</p>

The area was established on July 27, 1953 when the Armistice Agreement was signed during the Korean War, and includes the 2km-wide stretch of land both north and south of the line. The DMZ extends largely from Gyeonggi-do to Gangwon-do, including seven different cities and smaller counties of Paju, Yeoncheon, Cheorwon, Hwacheon, Yanggu, Inje and Goseong. The zone has been protected from human disturbance for about 6 decades and has unintentionally become a haven for wildlife, making it a popular destination for nature lovers.</p>
<p>Location </p>
<p>The Korean Demilitarized Zone intersects but does not follow the 38th parallel north, which was the border before the Korean War. It crosses the parallel on an angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of th e parallel and the east end lying north of it. </p>
<p>The DMZ is 250 kilometres long, approximately 4 km wide. Though the zone separating both sides is demilitarized, the border beyond that strip is one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world. The Northern Limit Line, or NLL, is the disputed maritime demarcation line between North and South Korea in the Yellow Sea, not agreed in the armistice. The coastline and islands on both sides of the NLL are also heavily militarized. </p>
<p>History </p>
<p>The 38th parallel north—which divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half—was the original boundary between the United States and Soviet Union's brief administration areas of Korea at the end of World War II. Upon the creation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, informally North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (ROK, informally South Korea) in 1948, it became a de factointernational border and one of the most tense fronts in the Cold War. </p>
<p>Both the North and the South remained dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the Korean War. That conflict, which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines, commenced on 25 June 1950, with a full-front </p>
<p>DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel, and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the front of the war back to near the 38th parallel. </p>
<p>In the Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953, the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back 2,000 m (2,200 yards) from the front line, creating a buffer zone 4 km (2.5 mi) wide. The Military Demarcation Line (MDL) goes through the center of the DMZ and indicates where the front was when the agreement was signed. </p>
<p>Owing to this theoretical stalemate, and genuine hostility between the North and the South, large numbers of troops are still stationed along both sides of the line, each side guarding against potential aggression from the other side. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL; ROK soldiers, however heavily armed, patrol under the aegis of military police, and have memorized each line of the armistice Sporadic outbreaks of violence have killed over 500 South Korean soldiers, 50 US soldiers and 250 soldiers from DPRK along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999. Daeseong-dong (also written Tae Sung Dong) and Kijŏng-dong are the only settlements allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ. Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency. In 2008, the village had a population of 218 people. The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950–53 Korean War. </p>
<p>To continue to deter North Korean incursion, in 2014 the United States government exempted the Korean DMZ from its pledge to eliminate anti-personnel landmines. On October 1, 2018, however, a 20-day process began to remove landmines from both sides of the DMZ. </p>

<p>JSA ( Joint Security Area ) </p>
<p>The Joint Security Area (JSA) is the only portion of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face. It is often called the Truce Village of Panmunjom (the Truce Village; or simply, Panmunjom) in the media and various military accounts. </p>
<p>The JSA is used by the two Koreas for diplomatic engagements and, until March 1991, was also the site of military negotiations between North Korea and the United Nations Command (UNC). In 2018, North and South Korean officials ordered the JSA to be cleared of all landmines, weapons, guard posts, and personnel. This withdrawal was complete on October 25, 2018 and the JSA now just contains 35 unarmed security guards. The area will also no longer function in its current state and it was agreed that it will now just serve as a tourist attraction. </p>
<p>The Joint Security Area is located at 37°57′21″N 126°40′36″ECoordinates: </p>
<p>37°57′21″N 126°40′36″E lying within the village of Panmunjom. </p>
<p>The original village of Panmunjom encompassed a larger area than the current inter-military complex of the JSA, and consisted mostly of farms. The JSA itself is actually about 800 meters (1⁄2 mile) south of where the village proper used to be, though still within the village's old farming area. It is because of this proximity that there is often ambiguity between the terms JSA or Panmunjom. Panmunjom no longer exists as an inhabited village as it was destroyed during the war, and all that now remains on the site of the village is the building constructed for the signing of the armistice agreement, now the North Korea Peace Museum. </p>
<p>Residing within the North Korean half of the DMZ, the village has not been rebuilt or repopulated, but the name carries on and the name is now used to usually refer to the JSA. The village gained lasting fame as the site where the Korean Armistice Agreement was negotiated. General Nam Il of North Korea and General William Harrison, Jr. of the United </p>
<p>Nations Command signed the armistice agreement at 10:00 am on July 27, 1953, in a hastily constructed pavilion at Panmunjom. </p>
<p>General Mark W. Clark, Commander-in-Chief, UNC, later countersigned the document in a separate ceremony at Munsan, approximately 18 kilometers (11 mi) south of the DMZ; and Marshal Kim Il Sung, Korean People's Army (KPA) Supreme Commander, along with Peng Dehuai, Commander, Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPV), countersigned it at Kaesong, approximately 10 kilometers (6 mi) to the north in another separate ceremony. </p>
<p>The JSA has been the site of numerous major events since its establishment in 1953, the first of which was the repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs) after the cessation of hostilities, across the Bridge of No Return. </p>

Nine Dragon Heads 
Introduction 
Nine Dragon Heads aspires to generate positive environmental and spiritual legacies for the future. This is in a context where humankind benefits from manipulating and dominating its natural surroundings; regarding the natural environment as a target and challenge for conquest, a test of its ability to transform and possess nature. 
Our desire and ingenuity to exploit and develop the natural environment through domination and control implies superiority. Reflecting on the history of the planet however, many species of all forms became extinct when the friendly environmental conditions that firstly nurtured their birth later changed and became hostile. 
The question of when will humankind disappear hangs over us. No matter how 'special' we Homo Sapiens think we may be, we have to realise we are a part of the greater natural world and the product of a unique environment that supports our life. 
How can we lead a life with understanding and respect for the world of nature? How can we maintain a life peacefully and fairly for the survival of mankind? 
Nine Dragon Heads changes ‘I’ into ‘we’, a community of artists, who explore and re-consider the relationship and equilibrium between people and the natural environment. 
Nine Dragon Heads joins with other communities to share their imagination, experience and ideas through creative art practices, to reveal and celebrate both diverse and common consciousness and to further co-operation. 
Nine Dragon Heads aims to further greater understanding of human nature and the world through restorative creative action and engagement and in so doing aims to leave a healthier environment - the heritage of the future - to posterity.

“DMZ & JSA"" 2019Art Politic-Border Crossing ONSAEMIRO
""DMZ & JSA” is the fourth project from the Nine Dragon Heads' series of events that emphasize a new component in NDH’s current activity. It is working on the subjects of mutual influences and connections between a art event and the geography of its realization, a international art politic, and a large-scale art event with a fixed location and periodicity. Alongside the usual mode of NDH such as open-air symposiums, research-oriented workshops, exhibitions and conferences, these projects will be held in the Demilitarized Zone and Joint Sceurity Area (DMZ & JSA), the 155mile from West to East Borderline that divides the North and South Korea, and will be realised through both an exhibition and research presentation at the Suwon Museum of Art, Experimental Space UZ, Space NOON. 
The research destination of DMZ is a weapons-free buffer zone between North and South Korea. The area was established on July 27, 1953 when the Armistice Agreement was signed during the Korean War, and created a the 2km-wide stretch of land both north and south of the demarcation line. The DMZ extends largely from Gyeonggi-do to Gangwon-do, includes seven different cities and smaller counties of Paju, Yeoncheon, Cheorwon, Hwacheon, Yanggu, Inje and Goseong. As a results, The zone has been protected from human disturbance for the last six decades and has unintentionally become a haven for wildlife. 
With the project ""DMZ & JSA"" Nine Dragon Heads continues its journey on important geographic routes and the locations of special environmental, cultural and historical significance. Working within the DMZ & JSA will be especially rewarding for the NDH artists-researchers for several reasons. 
As a multimedia art project, ""DMZ & JSA"" will examine the complexity of environmental and social issues as well as the political, geographic, historical, and cultural aspects of the DMZ & JSA. This will be presented through an Archive Show and include installation, video, sculpture, photography, and performance. 
The title ""Border Crossing ONSAEMIRO"" refers to an artistic investigation of the nature of borders. On the one hand, the title underlines the vital importance of something happening inside the restricted and exceptional environment of the DMZ & JSA, while on the other it offers the possibility of going outside the visible or hidden limits - not only physically, but also intellectually, in order to research differences and commonalities that can be found at the DMZ & JSA . 
“DMZ & JSA” presents the works of the International Environmental Art Symposium - Nine Dragon Heads. Nine Dragon Heads is an interdisciplinary platform where artists from across the 5 continents work in locations that may be environmentally, economically or politically troubled, following important cultural, historical and geopolitical routes. Initiated in South Korea in 1995 in response to the destruction of an important historical site, Nine Dragon Heads has evolved to address varying crises and transitory situations in localized and situation-specific ways. The title of the project “Border Crossing ONSAEMIRO” refers to the inherently spontaneous nature of the International Environmental Art Symposium which will react to the particular geographic and environmental situation of the DMZ & JSA 2019. The project accompanied by an exhibition of working traces, artifacts and performances from within the DMZ at the Suwon Museum of Art, Space UZ , Space NOON from 22th, Sept to 5th, OCT, 2019.
“DMZ & JSA” brings together site-specific work, installation, video, sculpture, photography and performance. It synthesizes and facilitates joint and individual works, while threads of overlapping artistic inquiry are produced in a process of evolving collaborative association. Participating artists do not aim to place full stops or to answer specific questions. Rather, they look for the creation of a space where experimental open air and public art-practice results in an ethical artistic message. 
“DMZ & JSA ”is not supported by any formal umbrella institution or major foundation. The majority of organizational functions are implemented directly by the Nine Dragon Heads participating artists, with directorial overview and coordination provided by Park Byoung Uk, the project’s artistic director.
“DMZ & JSA” is organized in collaboration with the SHUROOP art group and dedicated to the support and promotion of contemporary visual arts. The project is curated by Magda Guruli.

DMZ ( Demilitarized Zone )
The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a weapons-free buffer zone between North and South Korea. The area was established on July 27, 1953 when the Armistice Agreement was signed during the Korean War, and includes the 2km-wide stretch of land both north and south of the line.

<p>At Alchemy Art, supporting the community we work with is one of our primary goals, along with continuing to push creatives to grow and offer them new opportunities. Our hope is that we always give back something in the projects we create, whether it be for charity (which we've donated just under $50,000 to-date) or working with other professionals in our community.</p>
<p>With approval from <i>The Dragon Prince</i> team, this project is for-profit, supporting the creators in the process. The Dragon Prince team has always been supportive of creative efforts, and that's something we hope to honor with this endeavor. We truly seek to make a memorable book that's both a collector's item and an exciting experience for the reader.</p>

<p>As with any large project, there are always potential problems with working with many contributors and many different manufacturers. We're grateful to be working with all manufacturers that we have used before for this project, and we're confident of their quality and our mutual expectations.</p>
<p>In that, almost all of our artwork for the Echoes of Thunder book is complete; the items that remain are finalizing the book designs and doing a few test runs. We don't anticipate any delays in pushing the book to production or seeing any of the merchandise sent to the printers (once the project funds, we'll be okaying test pieces!). </p>

</div></div>","Happiness. The small cheerful memories of the past that we hold onto.Sadness. The hurt reflected in the mirror when we take those breaths to stay calm.Fear. The nagging worries that threaten to pull us undone.Surprise. The emotion that can turn from wonder to horror in a heartbeat.Anger. The fiery bitterness of wounds that never seem to close. Disgust. The disappointment and judgement of actions done. 
In the 1970s, psychologist Paul Eckman pointed to these six emotions as those that lie at the root of all emotional action and reactions. Much like in real life, the characters in our favorite tales are, at their core, compelled by these feelings.
Today, join us as we venture into the storytelling of The Dragon Prince to paint an illustrative homage to our favorite characters; let's make this book a reality!

Echoes of Thunder is a 200+ page art anthology that features works from 75 contributors from around the globe. The book is a celebration of The Dragon Prince and its characters, who we follow on various adventures in the hit Netflix series. 
While looking at both major and minor characters, each illustrator was assigned one of the six core emotions and asked to show us how the series depicted that emotion in a character of their choice. From there, we worked with each of them to cultivate a visual narrative showcasing the various aspects of the scene.
Whether you're new to The Dragon Prince fandom or have been following since the first glimpses of dragons made their way onto the internet, we welcome you to join us on this artistic journey and hope you'll support us.

As a thanks for sharing our campaign, the top three people with the most referrals will be granted a $40, $20 and $10 credit to the store. Please see the blurb below for notes on referral tracking from Indiegogo:
For a backer to count as a referrer, they must promote your campaign with Indiegogo’s share tools while logged into their Indiegogo account. This is important because otherwise, their unique ID won’t be attached to any resulting contributions or visits.


At Alchemy Art, supporting the community we work with is one of our primary goals, along with continuing to push creatives to grow and offer them new opportunities. Our hope is that we always give back something in the projects we create, whether it be for charity (which we've donated just under $50,000 to-date) or working with other professionals in our community.
With approval from The Dragon Prince team, this project is for-profit, supporting the creators in the process. The Dragon Prince team has always been supportive of creative efforts, and that's something we hope to honor with this endeavor. We truly seek to make a memorable book that's both a collector's item and an exciting experience for the reader.

Note: The breakdown for 500 books is above. In the 500 book breakdown pictured, the owners & art directors of Alchemy Art aren't paid for their efforts (which amount to several thousand hours cumulatively). These are the primary items that are funded first to make sure the project is funded successfully.
To the best of our ability, we'll adhere to the timetable! Our hope is to have items in during the early portion of November and start getting the items moving out mid-November. (Barring any extreme situations, all books should be received by Christmas!)

As with any large project, there are always potential problems with working with many contributors and many different manufacturers. We're grateful to be working with all manufacturers that we have used before for this project, and we're confident of their quality and our mutual expectations.
In that, almost all of our artwork for the Echoes of Thunder book is complete; the items that remain are finalizing the book designs and doing a few test runs. We don't anticipate any delays in pushing the book to production or seeing any of the merchandise sent to the printers (once the project funds, we'll be okaying test pieces!). 
We work with BackerKit for post-campaign fulfilment and PrintNinja for our main set of custom books. 

All in all, we always strive to be fully transparent and forthcoming about any issues, and will always update when we have enough information to pass along.
If you have any issues at any time, please feel free to reach out to us at alchemyartgroup@gmail.com.",18.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Throughout my entire career as an artist, books have been important to me. I made miniature ""books"" as a child and graduated into zinemaking and handmade books. I used to go to the bookstore with my late grandfather and absolutely marvel at the pages surrounding me. Making books felt like a natural fit both as an artist and as a photographer. I made a number of artist books in college that were very successful, including my senior thesis project. Books have always felt like the perfect space for my photography and writing to come together.</p>
<p>I am passionate about this project. I have been working on it nonstop for months and feel I have created some of the strongest imagery I have ever made and that it melds beautifully with the writing component of the project as well. Unfortunately, due to limited resources, handmaking the book is not practical at this time. I have partnered with Conveyor Arts to come up with a beautiful proof that I am excited to make into reality. The costs of book production are expensive and frankly, I need help. This is where y'all come in.</p>
<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p>ca·dence (‘kādns): a modulation or inflection of the voice; a modulation in reading aloud as implied by the structure and ordering of words and phrases in written text; a fall in pitch of the voice at the end of a phrase or sentence; rhythm.</p>
<p>This project describes an existential crisis at 3 AM following a stoned orgasm. It chronologically follows a train of thought in the form of text-to-speech notes on an iPhone. Save for punctuation and spelling, these notes are unedited.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking for $600 to self-publish my book through Conveyor Arts. This will pay for all the production costs associated with the book. I am offering many perk options for those who donate, including stickers from this project, postcards, and preorder copies of the book itself, as well as copies of my other releases. This is a really great opportunity to both support me as an artist and be the owner of some of my work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I struggled to find my place in the world after graduation. I threw myself into the world of bartending and took a break from creating art, but I was not as happy as I could be. While I am still bartending to support myself, I have really dedicated myself to my practice in the last few months and am very proud of what I am creating.  It has been hard to make ends meet as it is, and the idea of publishing this book seemed like a luxury. I have a hard time asking people for help; it was only after an overwhelming response on Instagram that I decided that I wanted to open this project up for donations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Thankfully, because I am not printing and binding myself this time around, there are very few risks and challenges involved. The quote I have recieved from Conveyor is thorough and I have all of my costs laid out in front of me.</p>

<h3>Stop me if you've heard this one before:</h3>
<p><i>You are a baker - a friend of an acquaintance asks you to bake her dream wedding cake for free. Don't worry, she'll tell the guests all about you!</i></p>
<p><i>You are a graphic designer - your uncle's best friend's nephew asks you to design his logo, free of charge.  But don't worry, he's gonna pin a few on the board at the local coffee shop with all the other cards - everyone will see it and the exposure will be great!</i></p>
<p><i>You are a comic artist - some random person on the internet demands you draw their dog dressed up as a superhero for free. They promise to show their friends.  WHY DO YOU WANT MONEY? WHERE IS YOUR PASSION? WHY DO YOU HATE DOGS? WhAtEvEr YoUr WoRk IsNt EvEn tHaT gOoD loL.</i></p>
<p>And the list goes on.</p>
<p>Of course, requests and expectations of working for nothing more than exposure is not limited to creative professionals. You'll hear some of the same lamentations from people in a variety of trades - plumbers, accountants, mechanics and more. Word of mouth is great and so very important, but exposure does not pay the bills! The Exposure Coin won't pay the bills either, but it will at least give you a laugh, help you remember your value, and give you a little something to clench your fist around the next time someone asks!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570073483/xao3trk6ohndjsr25yyi.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>The first design in The Exposure Coin™ line of novelty coins was made available for online purchase in the beginning of August.  There are currently two designs available: the original design (left) that started it all and Liberty (right), featuring a partial pressing of Ron Landis' Liberty Skull!<br/><a href=""https://ruefish.com/exposure-coins"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570073593/vd3yz5enam0ym2aqtyds.png"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p>If you've ever tried to pay a bill in exposure, you know how well it works: it doesn't. Working for exposure stinks.  It's senseless.  No, wait.  It's cents-less.  If you had a penny for every time someone asked, you'd probably be a little better off.</p>
<h3>Our newest Exposure Coin design: Cented!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570131081/gjupjjt4lxrcu56jacjk.png"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Above: Mock-up of the next design</i></p>
<p><i>Cented</i> features an aluminum ring with a US cent encased in the center.  Along with <i>Cented</i>, we're releasing <i>Uncented</i>: an identical aluminum design without an encased cent!  (We offer no apologies for our absolutely shameless word-play).</p>
</div><div>
<p>Many of our customers know about our penchant for vintage machines and souvenirs. From buttons to bracelets, they've inspired our work from the beginning.  Coins have been no different - so it should come as no surprise that we looked to vintage encased cents and lucky coins for inspiration!</p>
<p>Encased coins began showing up as souvenirs in 1901. Their production and popularity peaked after World War II into the 50s with the end of wartime conservation efforts, and the increased availability of inexpensive aluminum and other metals.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570074443/gyywkkibbi0pez8zw3xy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Both <i>Cented</i> and <i>Uncented</i> will be made using a 32mm (~1.25"") aluminum ring approximately 2mm (~5/64"") thick. We think it's the perfect size - small enough to keep in your pocket, but large enough to not be mistaken for the loose change and lost.  All <i>Cented</i> Exposure Coins have one US cent encased in the center. <strong>Just for this campaign, we are only using pennies that are 95% copper.</strong></p>
<p>With the exception of 1943, cents minted from 1900 through 1981 are what we're looking to encase in the perks that we send out through this campaign. Don't get too excited, we seriously doubt we'll end up with many pennies more than 50 or so years old. Why the emphasis on copper content? Fun fact: the copper content in the pennies we're using are actually worth more than a penny! We think that makes the concept behind this design just a little more fun, and the extra sorting and possible expense in pursuit of this little chuckle is the least we can do to say thanks for the support!</p>
<p>We press the design into the aluminum at the same time we insert the cent. It's the pressure in the production process that causes the metal to flow and lock the penny in place. The penny encased within a <i>Cented </i>is not going anywhere without a whole lot of effort, probable destruction of the aluminum encasement, and possible injury. <i><strong>The penny is not meant to be removed: do not try to remove it. </strong>Any attempt to remove the penny is done at your risk.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570080513/k6fbhisejszce1ggnzf9.png"" src=""""/></i></p>

<p><u><strong>Encase of Exposure <i>(unlocked once Early Exposure runs out)</i></strong></u><br/>You get both <i>Cented </i>with a US cent encased in the center as well as <i>Uncented</i>  with the cent missing!</p>
<p><u><strong>Centsational Exposure</strong></u><br/>If you're looking to get a few coins, this is the perk for you!  You get a three pack of <i>Cented</i> and <i>Uncented</i>.</p>

<p>Each coin is made manually, one by one in our shop and we work in small batches, which is why reward tiers are marked with limited availability. We will open up new perks with later delivery dates if perks with earlier delivery dates sell out.</p>
<p>The Exposure Coin™ is an ongoing product line and project. Any funds remaining beyond the completion and delivery of this design will be put toward continued development of The Exposure Coin product line and associated activities.  It's more than just merch, it's a mission and a movement!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570074768/fsygyhfegpz2fhxtjbcj.png"" src=""""/></p>

We anticipate a timeline of approximately 6-8 weeks from campaign close for production, packaging and shipping. Answering your backer surveys in a timely fashion will help us to stay on track in getting rewards shipped to you.<br/><br/>Our goal is to begin shipping no later than the second week of December, however our timeline allows for minor shipping delays for the remaining supplies.

<p>Hello.
My name is Jun Sugawara of the Animator Supporting Organization.</p>
<p>This
project is aimed to set up more dormitory facilities that animators who are new
to the industry can use for 30,000JPY per month(including utility expenses).
The animators who get to use the [Starting Out Animators’ Dormitory] will also
get chances for social exchanges beyond the boundaries of companies, and also
receive technical support for illustrations and drawing. Currently, we are
supporting 2 starting out animators at the dorm. For this project, we aim to
expand the dorm facility up to 2 times the current scale.</p>
<p>But
as we are short in managing funds in order to expand the dorm facilities, we
would like to ask for your kind support.</p>

is a country which lacks in natural resources.</p>
<p>Even
now, many animation shows are shown on TV and in theaters, and there are also
many people who say they love watching Anime. But behind that shiny center
stage, the average salary of animators in their 20’s are said to be just around
90,000JPY per month. (※1)</p>
<p>The
reason why the earnings are so drastically low despite of the hard labor,
overtime, holiday shifts at almost every field of work, is because in most
cases, animators are hired and paid according to the piece-work system(※2) based on the price per each
frame an animator draws, and it takes time to become a skillful animator who
can draw quicker and cover more frames within the given time, to have a fair
amount of earnings per month.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432295747/hcyazdmcnydbsv9k6gnv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>Also,
many animation studios are mostly located in Tokyo(※especially in the Suginami and
Nerima districts), and the high monthly cost for rent in Tokyo becomes a
greater burden for starting out animators who come to Tokyo from other regions
in Japan. (So they are in a state where they have to pay high rent in Tokyo to
live, despite of their low income)</p>
<p>※1) According
to the research on the current situation(answered by 728 people) announced by
the Japan Animation Creators Association(JAniCA) in 2009 states that the
average monthly income of animators in their 20’s is a bit more than 90,000JPY.
Which makes it around 1,100,000JPY on an yearly basis.</p>
<p>※2) In the
case of TV series, the price for inbetweens is 200JPY per piece(when the work
is done under prime contract). So if an animator draws 300 pieces per month,
the monthly income is 300 pieces ×
200JPY = 60,000JPY. But it is especially difficult for a starting out animator
to draw 300 pieces per month. Also, as animation work is time-consuming, it is
not likely to have part-time jobs on the side.</p>

<p>  We think that it would be nice to have an
environment where many active animators and applicants who want to be a part of
the anime production, can have a more direct contact and exchanges with each
other. But as the system management and operations required for such environment
is tremendous, in reality it is difficult for an average animator to try such a
thing by oneself.</p><p><span>  Therefore the Animator Supporting
Organization is thinking of being in the position to take over that troublesome
“Management &amp; Operations” part, to develop an environment where animators

Animation
content has gained worldwide popularity, and for Japan, it is also an industry

contest. Until now, we have supported 5 animators with 600,000JPY as [Residence
Support Fund] for the past 3 years.
・Operating
dormitory for starting out animators
  http://animator.main.jp/dormitory_2014.html
  We have opened the 1st dormitory
of the [Starting Out Animators’ Dormitory] on March, 2014. Currently, we are
providing residential support to 2 starting out animators. With the current
project, we are aiming to expand the facility to 2 times the current scale. 
(Interior
of the 1st Dormitory opened on March 2014)・Holding
animation workshops
  http://animator.main.jp/workshop_2014_001.html
  We think that it would be nice to have an
environment where many active animators and applicants who want to be a part of
the anime production, can have a more direct contact and exchanges with each
other. But as the system management and operations required for such environment
is tremendous, in reality it is difficult for an average animator to try such a
thing by oneself.  Therefore the Animator Supporting
Organization is thinking of being in the position to take over that troublesome
“Management & Operations” part, to develop an environment where animators
can find it easy to come and give lectures, and also create a ‘Platform’ where
many animators can have easy access to.
  ※The
Starting Out Animators’ Dormitory users can attend the Anime Workshops for free
of charge.[About

<p>Hi, you may know me, I am Lawrence Dinkins (or NSAA to my poetry friends). I am an underground art and cultural archivist. I am a local Sacramento poet that is a co-host at Jose Montoya's Poetry Unplugged, Mahogany Urban Poetry Series and 3rd Thursday Lunch Hour Poetry at the Central Library. I also have three podcast: Black Talk Sacramento, Coffee &amp; Poets and The NSAA Report. I'm also provide sound at The Brickhouse Art Gallery for some of their events.  </p>
<p>I love what I do and I want to keep doing what I do--only better. I want to take my promotion of the art and black community here in Sacramento to the next level but I need your help to do this. I need better equipment and resources.</p>
<p>Every year I do a fundraiser for my birthday to upgrade my capabilities. This year’s fundraiser is a bit more ambitious but I know we can do it.  </p>
<p>In 2010 I did a night of poetry and music called Poet Vs. Band for the now ended ""In The Flow Festival"" a festival celebrating improvisational music established by Ross Hammond. He asked me to do a poetry night and what I came up with is a night of music and poetry fusion. It went so well I did a couple more. I decided to resurrect the format for my birthday. What better way to celebrate my birthday but with night of poetry and music. Which are my passion. </p>
<p>Art for me is that thing we all live for. It makes us feel better, it makes us reflect, it reveals more about ourselves. It is something we pass down to the next generation. We not only past down our knowledge but we also pass down how we see the world. I want to be part of that archiving. It is important that we capture not just the broad stokes of Sacramento but also its underground. </p>
<p>With your help, I can obtain some of the equipment needed to do the above. This year my personal goal is $1500 (although the indigogo is set to my wish amount of 2,500). 1,500 should get the new laptop I desperately need. But if more is raised that would further my capabilities. And if less is raised that is okay too. Below are the achievement benchmarks.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“If Then” Benchmarks</strong></p>
<p>1. If $250 then Soundboard</p>
<p>2. If $550 then Soundboard + Video Card</p>

</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Help Us to keep this magazine ad-free and really independent</b></p><br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">What is SPOON Magazine?</h4>
<span style=""background-color: #ffff00;""><b>SPOON</b> is an ad-free, fine-Art and slow fashion photography magazine</span>. Originally created in 1996 as one of the first fashion Internet publication, we printed our first special edition that same year. After 7 issues, we left the company when the commercial protocol started to conflict with our creative goals and values. We recently re-purchased the <b>SPOON</b> magazine trademark, and right away, we relaunched and first issue of the new edition was born in early 2014.<p></p><br/>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Breaking free from the advertising pollution and feeling happier</h4><p>The biggest decision we made when re-starting <b>SPOON</b> was to make <span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">a completely ad-free magazine</span> because we felt this was the only way to keep our publication independent, and free from commercial pressure.</p>
<p>Since repurchasing, we’ve printed only with the help of the pre-orders on Indiegogo: <span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">we have no other revenues but sales and pre-orders</span>. When the fixed goal for previous issues was not reached, we paid from our own, along with help from some generous friends. We won’t complain about it. This is our choice! We know that <b>SPOON </b>cannot be as independent, daring and free  if we take money from advertisers. We believe there is a strong future for a <span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">reader funded magazine</span> like ours.</p><p>As we always gave freedom to our contributors, we give you the freedom to reflect and get inspired with no advertising interference of any kind. </p><br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Ready to roll !</h4><p><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">We already have produced the brand new content for <b>SPOON | 04</b></span>, and we cannot wait to present it to you!

Help Us to keep this magazine ad-free and really independentWhat is SPOON Magazine?
SPOON is an ad-free, fine-Art and slow fashion photography magazine. Originally created in 1996 as one of the first fashion Internet publication, we printed our first special edition that same year. After 7 issues, we left the company when the commercial protocol started to conflict with our creative goals and values. We recently re-purchased the SPOON magazine trademark, and right away, we relaunched and first issue of the new edition was born in early 2014.
Breaking free from the advertising pollution and feeling happierThe biggest decision we made when re-starting SPOON was to make a completely ad-free magazine because we felt this was the only way to keep our publication independent, and free from commercial pressure.
Since repurchasing, we’ve printed only with the help of the pre-orders on Indiegogo: we have no other revenues but sales and pre-orders. When the fixed goal for previous issues was not reached, we paid from our own, along with help from some generous friends. We won’t complain about it. This is our choice! We know that SPOON cannot be as independent, daring and free  if we take money from advertisers. We believe there is a strong future for a reader funded magazine like ours.As we always gave freedom to our contributors, we give you the freedom to reflect and get inspired with no advertising interference of any kind. Ready to roll !We already have produced the brand new content for SPOON | 04, and we cannot wait to present it to you! To get the magazine launched for end of April 2016, we just need a little bit of help to fund the final phase: the printing and shipping of the magazines3,500 € is our goal for this issue. Every bit of money donated, will be going towards the intended cause. Any excess of our goal will go directly into funding our next issue,so that we can raise the production value of our contents and pay for our contributors expenses appropriately. Please, check out this fantastic line-up of artists curated from around the world for this issue: Lars Botten, Marcel Boudan,  Patrice Fuma Courtis, Peter C. Christensen,Emmanuel Gimeno, Steve Hiett, Andrew Lyman, Ollie Ma', Andreï Molodkin,  Stephen Rose, Sanna Saastamoinen-Barrois, and many more .

<br/><h2>How this project was identified</h2>
<p>
</p><p>During a strategic planning session in 2015, the members of Artspace identified the need to reach out
and engage our local community over the next several years.
Artspace’s location inside the Plant Zero Art Center makes it
difficult for visitors to find us, and keeps us hidden from the
public at large. The members decided that we needed to make our
street entrance at 31 East 3rd Street more visible to encourage
new patrons to come inside. The Public Kinetic Art Exhibition Space will
give Artspace much needed visibility and deliver enticing visual
displays that will peak the public’s curiosity, encouraging them to
come inside to learn more about the project and other exhibitions on
view inside the gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>Why this project is innovative</h2>
<p>
</p><p>Projection displays have long been
limited to night time performances due to the highly specialized
equipment needed for day-light viewing. By providing these displays
during the daytime, Artspace is creating a new way for the public to
experience kinetic art during breaks from their work and on their way
to and from their homes. Visitors to Richmond will have a new fine
art attraction to explore during their daytime adventures around the
river and in the Shockoe Slip and Bottom. Moving image art tends to
be more accessible to the general public, creating a non-intimidating
first impression of the gallery. This will encourage people to come
inside to get more information about the public art on view and to
gain exposure to the other more traditional work that is frequently
exhibited inside, making a big impact on the gallery's ability to
promote the understanding and awareness of contemporary visual and
performance art.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Site of the project<br/>
</h2>
<p>
</p><p>The site of the Public Kinetic Art Space will be the
street level window at the 31 E. 3rd St. entrance of Artspace.
Artspace is located in the Manchester district of Richmond, in a
rapidly growing area of urban renewal. According to the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, in an article titled ""Momentum gathering speed
as Manchester springs back to life"" published on Wednesday,
March 19, 2014, ""About 3,700 apartments have been built in
Manchester in the past 10 years and 1,200 more are under
construction..."" <br/></p><p>Artspace's neighbors on E. 3rd Street include
the Plant Zero Cafe and the offices of Style Weekly. Artspace's
location in Industrial Manchester is within easy walking distance of
an older, under-served neighborhood that will also benefit from the
display. East 3rd Street is a route commonly used by vehicular traffic going to
and from Hull Street to I-95's Maury St. Exit.<br/></p><p>The site is near numerous Richmond attractions like the new RVA street Art Festival Site at the Southern States Silos, the Floodwall
Walk, Canal Walk, Cap to Cap Bike Trail, Shockoe Bottom and Shockoe
Slip. <br/></p>
<p>
</p><h2>Impact on the community</h2>
<p>
</p><p>The program will activate the public space outside of Artspace's East
3rd Street entrance as well as the industrial Manchester community.
The public art display in our East 3rd Street window will increase
the public's awareness of contemporary art and encourage their
understanding of the work through information and literature available inside the gallery and on our website.<br/></p><p>The Public Kinetic Art Exhibition
Space will benefit students and artists involved in the display of
their work as well the general public of the Manchester community. <a href=""https://vimeo.com/156459376/547179db49"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watch video examples of work from VCUarts Department of Kinetic Imagery.</a></p><p>In the words of Pamela T. Turner, Chair of the VCUarts Department of Kinetic Imaging:</p><p><i>""The department of Kinetic Imaging has a comprehensive curriculum that covers video, animation, sounds, emerging media and the many hybrids and extensions of those areas. All students in the BFA program get a solid foundation in video, sounds, and animation production. The curriculum allows flexibility, enabling students to focus on an area or to create a cross-disciplinary art practice. It is critical that our students make art and media work that is meaningful, are able to make meaningful analysis and evaluation, attain a high level of electronic and digital media technical skills, and are professionally prepared upon completion of their degree.<br/><br/>This partnership [with artspace will] support these professional development goals [for the students] as they work outside of the classroom to apply their critical skills, and present their work to a public audience. They will gain invaluable experience working with a gallery such as Artspace to expand the offering of digital and electronic media arts . . . It is critical for the department to have this relationship as outreach into the community and to ensure that we contribute to the ongoing art welfare of the larger community. This work has the potential for inspiring under-served segments of our community, providing an accessible place to learn about kinetic artwork.""</i><br/></p><br/><h2>Goals and objectives</h2>
<p>
</p><p>The primary audience will be the
general public – both the growing local population as well as
nearby residents from previously existing under-served neighborhoods
in the Manchester area. Artspace wants to activate the under-served
Manchester community by engaging residents and visitors with the goal
of encouraging them to come inside and learn more about the kinetic
display as well as other forms of contemporary art on view inside the
gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This project creates a Public Art
Exhibition venue destination which will activate and engage the
community as a whole, including the growing population of urban
dwellers flocking to the new residential locations in Manchester as
well as nearby residents from lower income neighborhoods. The program
has the potential of inspiring this under-served segment of society
to learn about and create kinetic artwork, providing new avenues of
creative expression.</p><h2>
What if we don't reach our funding goal?</h2>Artspace and VCUarts Department of Kinetic Imaging are dedicated to raising funds for this project. If total funding isn't met, we will first allocate donations towards the lighting renovations required in the office and next towards the purchase of the laser projector. The projector can be used in other places both inside and outside of the gallery providing exhibition space while we continue to fund raise for the custom screen. <br/><br/><h2>More than we need?</h2>In addition to this Indiegogo Campaign, Artspace has submitted grant 
proposals to the Virginia Commission for the Arts and CultureWorks Richmond for a
 total of $32,500. Award announcements from these proposals are due at the beginning of summer. If we are awarded grant money and/or raise more funds than needed, we will purchase a sound system for outside/inside use to go with the video aspect of the exhibitions, pay for professional design services for the office renovation and provide stipends for artists, technical assistants, and curators. <br/><p></p></div>","Help Create a New Public Kinetic Art Exhibition Space

How this project was identified

During a strategic planning session in 2015, the members of Artspace identified the need to reach out
and engage our local community over the next several years.
Artspace’s location inside the Plant Zero Art Center makes it
difficult for visitors to find us, and keeps us hidden from the
public at large. The members decided that we needed to make our
street entrance at 31 East 3rd Street more visible to encourage
new patrons to come inside. The Public Kinetic Art Exhibition Space will
give Artspace much needed visibility and deliver enticing visual
displays that will peak the public’s curiosity, encouraging them to
come inside to learn more about the project and other exhibitions on
view inside the gallery.

Why this project is innovative

Projection displays have long been
limited to night time performances due to the highly specialized
equipment needed for day-light viewing. By providing these displays
during the daytime, Artspace is creating a new way for the public to
experience kinetic art during breaks from their work and on their way
to and from their homes. Visitors to Richmond will have a new fine
art attraction to explore during their daytime adventures around the
river and in the Shockoe Slip and Bottom. Moving image art tends to
be more accessible to the general public, creating a non-intimidating
first impression of the gallery. This will encourage people to come
inside to get more information about the public art on view and to
gain exposure to the other more traditional work that is frequently
exhibited inside, making a big impact on the gallery's ability to
promote the understanding and awareness of contemporary visual and
performance art.





Site of the project


The site of the Public Kinetic Art Space will be the
street level window at the 31 E. 3rd St. entrance of Artspace.
Artspace is located in the Manchester district of Richmond, in a
rapidly growing area of urban renewal. According to the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, in an article titled ""Momentum gathering speed
as Manchester springs back to life"" published on Wednesday,
March 19, 2014, ""About 3,700 apartments have been built in
Manchester in the past 10 years and 1,200 more are under
construction..."" Artspace's neighbors on E. 3rd Street include
the Plant Zero Cafe and the offices of Style Weekly. Artspace's
location in Industrial Manchester is within easy walking distance of
an older, under-served neighborhood that will also benefit from the
display. East 3rd Street is a route commonly used by vehicular traffic going to
and from Hull Street to I-95's Maury St. Exit.The site is near numerous Richmond attractions like the new RVA street Art Festival Site at the Southern States Silos, the Floodwall
Walk, Canal Walk, Cap to Cap Bike Trail, Shockoe Bottom and Shockoe
Slip. 

Impact on the community

The program will activate the public space outside of Artspace's East
3rd Street entrance as well as the industrial Manchester community.
The public art display in our East 3rd Street window will increase
the public's awareness of contemporary art and encourage their
understanding of the work through information and literature available inside the gallery and on our website.The Public Kinetic Art Exhibition
Space will benefit students and artists involved in the display of
their work as well the general public of the Manchester community. Watch video examples of work from VCUarts Department of Kinetic Imagery.In the words of Pamela T. Turner, Chair of the VCUarts Department of Kinetic Imaging:""The department of Kinetic Imaging has a comprehensive curriculum that covers video, animation, sounds, emerging media and the many hybrids and extensions of those areas. All students in the BFA program get a solid foundation in video, sounds, and animation production. The curriculum allows flexibility, enabling students to focus on an area or to create a cross-disciplinary art practice. It is critical that our students make art and media work that is meaningful, are able to make meaningful analysis and evaluation, attain a high level of electronic and digital media technical skills, and are professionally prepared upon completion of their degree.This partnership [with artspace will] support these professional development goals [for the students] as they work outside of the classroom to apply their critical skills, and present their work to a public audience. They will gain invaluable experience working with a gallery such as Artspace to expand the offering of digital and electronic media arts . . . It is critical for the department to have this relationship as outreach into the community and to ensure that we contribute to the ongoing art welfare of the larger community. This work has the potential for inspiring under-served segments of our community, providing an accessible place to learn about kinetic artwork.""Goals and objectives

The primary audience will be the
general public – both the growing local population as well as
nearby residents from previously existing under-served neighborhoods
in the Manchester area. Artspace wants to activate the under-served
Manchester community by engaging residents and visitors with the goal
of encouraging them to come inside and learn more about the kinetic
display as well as other forms of contemporary art on view inside the
gallery.

This project creates a Public Art
Exhibition venue destination which will activate and engage the
community as a whole, including the growing population of urban
dwellers flocking to the new residential locations in Manchester as
well as nearby residents from lower income neighborhoods. The program
has the potential of inspiring this under-served segment of society
to learn about and create kinetic artwork, providing new avenues of
creative expression.
What if we don't reach our funding goal?Artspace and VCUarts Department of Kinetic Imaging are dedicated to raising funds for this project. If total funding isn't met, we will first allocate donations towards the lighting renovations required in the office and next towards the purchase of the laser projector. The projector can be used in other places both inside and outside of the gallery providing exhibition space while we continue to fund raise for the custom screen. More than we need?In addition to this Indiegogo Campaign, Artspace has submitted grant 
proposals to the Virginia Commission for the Arts and CultureWorks Richmond for a
 total of $32,500. Award announcements from these proposals are due at the beginning of summer. If we are awarded grant money and/or raise more funds than needed, we will purchase a sound system for outside/inside use to go with the video aspect of the exhibitions, pay for professional design services for the office renovation and provide stipends for artists, technical assistants, and curators.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Most of the funds of this campaign will go towards the manufacturing (designing, printing, producing, studio hire) of the zine and music, as well as distribution and living expenses.
When you donate, you will receive fun things like digital downloads of my back catalog of music, original artwork and prints, and even original animations and songs written to your briefing.
If I don't reach the full campaign amount, I will still go ahead and make both the EP and zine, but both will be much more humble projects, and the zines will be very limited edition (10-20 copies in total)


The Impact

When you support this project, you are supporting a local artist, and will get your hands on original and personalised content.
If I reach my campaign goal, I believe the finished project would be wrapped up in early August.

Refira-se que esta é uma iniciativa sem fins lucrativos porque todos os dias o Porto nos surpreende com o melhor que tem e acreditamos está na altura de retribuirmos com o que de melhor temos para dar.

O Push Porto pretende ser um
festival multi-cultural com foco na arte
urbana e ilustração. À semelhança de muitas outras metrópoles mundiais, a cidade Invicta deve tomar o seu lugar no circuito do graffiti de qualidade e para tal nada melhor que um evento que concentre alguns dos melhores artistas
nacionais e internacionais da área. Para além de ser uma óptima

da cidade é algo que de certo marcará qualquer pessoa que se cruze com uma das muitas atividades do festival. É de considerar também que esta é um
bom modelo para cativar o público
estrangeiro amante deste tipo de arte.
Desta forma, consideramos que um evento
desta envergadura é uma mais valia para Invicta neste ano em que é considerada o melhor destino Europeu.
O festival irá englobar diversas
atividades que percorrem este tipo de artes
emergentes como por exemplo pintura de murais e exposições que formarão um roteiro criativo por toda a cidade do Porto:

Para além disto vamos também ter diversas atividades a acontecer durante toda a semana, como workshops, palestras, festas, instalações e acções de sensibilização. 






Tal como observamos em cidades como Lisboa, com a GAU
e a Underdogz, e em Ponta Delgada, com o festival Walk and Talk,
este tipo de iniciativas tem sempre grande apoio e admiração por parte dos cidadãos. O impacto nas cidades é sempre positivo.
Cria-se um novo tipo de turismo, cultivam-se os cidadãos e acima de tudo combate-se a degradação das cidades através da arte. 








O que precisamos
 Pretendemos que este festival seja gratuito e aberto a toda a população e desta forma necessitamos de toda o apoio possível de forma a conseguirmos concretizar todas as actividades que temos planeadas para esta semana de grande criatividade.
Para além de apoio monetário estamos à procura de:


Alimentação para os artistas que vêm pintar os murais e para os oradores que vêm dar palestras;
Viagens e estadias para os mesmos;
Andaimes;
Tintas (tanto tintas de rolo como tintas spray);

<p>The show explores the echoes and the subtle relationships that are established between works that are sometimes critical, and always fascinating.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Roots and River Productions grew from the small seed of an idea. Artistic Director Azure D. Osborne-Lee moved to New York City and experienced firsthand how difficult it can be for an emerging artist, especially an artist of color, to make headway in the theatre. And so, out of a desire to foster artistic community for queer artists of color, Roots and River Productions was born. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Roots and River's mission is to produce creative work grounded in the community. The company is an artistic home for artists of color residing in the New York City metropolitan area. Roots and River serves as an incubator for new work, a site of artistic exploration, and an agency for community outreach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The company's primary programming consists of the Roots and River Emerging Artist Mentorship Program and a portable, sustainable model for creating new work, simply called the Voicebox Workshops. Roots and River Productions has a particular interest in supporting the work of emerging interdisciplinary and performing artists. In 2012 Roots and River will kick off an artist residency program.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Roots and River's team has been hard at work since the beginning of the year producing the Voicebox Writing Workshop series internationally and setting up a mentorship program for emerging black queer artists in Brooklyn, New York, which will launch this fall. We have a vision and the drive, but we need your help to keep us going! </p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"">Making work in the big city isn't cheap! Our goal is to raise at least $3000 for the 2011/2012 Roots and River Emerging Artist Mentorship Program. This will cover stipends for our mentors as well as the cost of workshops for our mentees. Additionally, your contributions will help defray other program costs such as rehearsal, meeting, or studio space rental and transportation fees.</p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Roots and River accepts donations in all forms. If you have goods, services, or supplies that you would like to contribute, then we would be happy to receive them. Examples include paper, envelopes, photocopying privileges, and studio and/or rehearsal space. Every little bit counts and is much appreciated!</p>

<p>I am here campaigning to raise funds to purchase supplies and equipment that I need to further my success as an artist. These materials and the equipment I am in need of will give me a strong foundation and a sturdy platform to reach the next level of my goals. Not only will these things allow me to stock prints for shows and sale, it will also give me a great start on my goal of having a gallery showing in the near future.</p>
<p>With the ability to produce quality prints and keep a stock of my work, I will be able to sell prints, publish art books, cards, and decorative items, sell my work through galleries and publications, and travel to various locations for art shows.</p>
<p>Your help will not only boost my career as an artist, but it will give me the ability to produce the income I need, and allow me to gain the financial security to be able to care for my family without struggling or being dependent on others to help us through.</p>

<li>Paper supplies: stock of quality art paper to print, art papers, cards, and canvases for current sales and large canvases for my future gallery showing.</li>
<li>To stock up medium that I use: a variety of paints, pens, pencils, and additional woodworking tools. Also a larger supply of oil paints to accomplish my collection of large gallery paintings. These larger tubes sell for between $18 and $35 each.</li>
<li>Misc. items: brushes, thinning oils, cleaners.</li>
<li>Light table.</li>
<li>Lighting and table for my work space.</li>
<li>Small furnishings for storage.</li>
</ul><p>Up to this point, I have been working off of an end table in my living room, spreading out on my kitchen table between meals, or working on a clip board in my lap, wherever I can sit. I have been getting small supplies a couple times a month with my coupons, and making the best with what I have. I now have a studio space to work in, that is currently standing empty. I need your help to build my studio, my art career, and my LIFE.</p>
<p>I am offering acknowledgement at any and all shows I attend in the future, and to include you in any future mailings or updates on my progress via email or postal mail.

<p>White Rabbit<b> is an interactive 3-D art book inspired by philosophical &amp; literary themes.</b> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We've asked over </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">thirty young artists</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to create pieces as their own </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">individualized response</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to a selected quote and concept that will be featured in the book. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
central theme of this book is </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">reality as a social construction</span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>.</b> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Some of
the featured concepts include </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">gender performance</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, the non-binary spectrum, consumerism, the</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> male gaze</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, femininity, effects of media on perception and identity, </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">double-consciousness</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, technology</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and the constructed concept of “America.” </span></p><p>Artists are responding to quotes from those such as <b>Judith Butler, <b>John Berger, </b>Walter Lippmann, Jean Baudrillard, <b>Susan J. Douglas, </b>Slavoj Zizek, Nietzsche, <b>Plato, </b>Sartre</b>,<b> Simone de Beauvoir</b>, and the films <b><i>It Felt Like A Kiss</i> </b>and <b><i>Paris is Burning</i>.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>HOW?</b></p><p>With everything so <b>fast
paced and transient </b>in today’s world of mass media and technology, we've decided it's extremely important for White Rabbit to be made in print as a <b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">physical book </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">that is</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> highly interactive </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> engaging</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in a unique way. This will be achieved</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: bold;""> </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">through the addition of </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">colorful plastic layovers</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, foldouts, </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">3-D graphics and</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">glasses</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, scratch-off materials, thermochromatic ink, and of course, </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">shiny </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">materials. </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This kind of </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">specialty printing</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is where the majority of the costs will go.  </span></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>CO$TS</b>: </p>
<p>We’ve already raised <b>⅓ of
the necessary funds</b> but still need your help to see this project all the way through. We’ve found a <b>specialty printer</b> that has agreed to make the book with all of the
features mentioned above that we’ve envisioned. </p>
<p>In addition to printing, costs will also go towards
our <b>gallery opening</b> and <b>book launch event</b>, which will take place in <b>New York
City</b> in January 2015. Any <b>profits</b> will go towards the funding of our next White Rabbit project. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PERKS!</b></p>
<p>We’re working with a group of extremely talented, wonderful artists and individuals who have offered to gift
pieces of their work to backers, as a <b>personal gift of thanks</b> for helping to
support our project. We've also provided a number of unique and exciting prizes we hope you will enjoy.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>FUNDING GOALS:</b></p>
<p>Even <b>if we do not reach our
goal</b>, we will still use any amount of funding received towards the creation of
White Rabbit, but will be <b>highly limited</b> in what we can use in terms of features and materials for the book. This would likely mean not having the envisioned gallery
opening for our artists, where we would have <b>installations</b> and <b>original works</b> from
the book on display for the public. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>BUT WHY</b> <b>ARE WE DOING THIS??</b></p>
<p>We’re making this book in
response to what we see as a frustratingly high amount of <b>negative, superficial </b>and<b> unhealthy
art</b> that’s out there in the world, often specifically marketed towards and
consumed by <b>people our age.</b></p><p>
With White Rabbit we aim to make something both <b>sincere </b>and<b> meaningful </b>that will
encourage individuals to engage with <b>thought-provoking</b> and <b>perspective
changing works and ideas</b>, which we hope others will find as helpful
and inspiring in their own lives as we have in ours. </p><p><br/></p>

of psychological discovery."" - Urban Dictionary: white rabbit
WHO ARE WE? Emily & Sophie, co-founding coeditors of White Rabbit, and our managing editor Bianca, students at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. The three of us met last year in an extremely awesome, life-changing course called The Social Construction of Reality, taught by Stephen Duncombe, and decided to create White Rabbit in order to share and continue this experience with others JUST LIKE YOU. WHAT IS WHITE RABBIT?
White Rabbit is an interactive 3-D art book inspired by philosophical & literary themes. We've asked over thirty young artists to create pieces as their own individualized response to a selected quote and concept that will be featured in the book. The
central theme of this book is reality as a social construction. Some of
the featured concepts include gender performance, the non-binary spectrum, consumerism, the male gaze, femininity, effects of media on perception and identity, double-consciousness, technology and the constructed concept of “America.” Artists are responding to quotes from those such as Judith Butler, John Berger, Walter Lippmann, Jean Baudrillard, Susan J. Douglas, Slavoj Zizek, Nietzsche, Plato, Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and the films It Felt Like A Kiss and Paris is Burning.
HOW?With everything so fast
paced and transient in today’s world of mass media and technology, we've decided it's extremely important for White Rabbit to be made in print as a physical book that is highly interactive and engaging in a unique way. This will be achieved through the addition of colorful plastic layovers, foldouts, 3-D graphics and glasses, scratch-off materials, thermochromatic ink, and of course, shiny materials. This kind of specialty printing is where the majority of the costs will go.  
CO$TS: 
We’ve already raised ⅓ of
the necessary funds but still need your help to see this project all the way through. We’ve found a specialty printer that has agreed to make the book with all of the
features mentioned above that we’ve envisioned. 
In addition to printing, costs will also go towards
our gallery opening and book launch event, which will take place in New York
City in January 2015. Any profits will go towards the funding of our next White Rabbit project. 
PERKS!
We’re working with a group of extremely talented, wonderful artists and individuals who have offered to gift
pieces of their work to backers, as a personal gift of thanks for helping to
support our project. We've also provided a number of unique and exciting prizes we hope you will enjoy.  

FUNDING GOALS:
Even if we do not reach our
goal, we will still use any amount of funding received towards the creation of
White Rabbit, but will be highly limited in what we can use in terms of features and materials for the book. This would likely mean not having the envisioned gallery
opening for our artists, where we would have installations and original works from
the book on display for the public. 
BUT WHY ARE WE DOING THIS??
We’re making this book in
response to what we see as a frustratingly high amount of negative, superficial and unhealthy
art that’s out there in the world, often specifically marketed towards and
consumed by people our age.
With White Rabbit we aim to make something both sincere and meaningful that will
encourage individuals to engage with thought-provoking and perspective
changing works and ideas, which we hope others will find as helpful
and inspiring in their own lives as we have in ours.

<p class=""p2"">It all started from a conversation with friends that presented a simple reality - when you flip an election on its head, it's really just about choosing a future. And with that Think Act Vote (?!X) was founded and immediately set out to playfully ask people that very question; <i>What is the Future You Choose?</i></p>
<p class=""p3""><br/></p>
<p class=""p2"">We started with a ballet box and asked hundreds of people to think about and vote for the future they choose. The most powerful of these futures have recently been visualised by over fifty amazing illustrators - we'll be revealing this incredible work in the new year. We ran a t-shirt design competition, judged by an<span class=""s1""><b> </b><a href=""http://thinkactvote.org/friends/the-judges/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>esteemed creative panel</b></a></span>, including Fashion Designer Katharine Hamnett, Social Entrepreneur Cyndi Rhoades and Stylish Illustrator Daisy de Villeneuve, and the winning design by Jesson Yip was lovingly made into t-shirts by ethical fashion superstars, Komodo. We then ran an event called<a href=""http://thinkactvote.org/ecofashion/x-refashioned/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b> </b><span class=""s1""><b>?!X Refashioned</b></span></a> that saw leading ethical fashion designers Tara Starlet, Ada Zandtion, Beautiful Soul, Junky Styling and others design a one off piece and customisations for any one to do at home. And, with our travelling<a href=""http://thinkactvote.org/ecofashion/x-photobooth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <span class=""s1""><b>photobooth</b></span></a> we've travelled to events and festivals across the country, including Vintage Goodwood and Latitude Festival and snapped hundreds of people in the ?!X t-shirts. </p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">In 2011 we launched our Futures Interviews series, asking people to share their chosen futures and some of the ways we can think, act and vote to create them. The Futures Interviews are continuing to fly into our inbox thick and fast, and we're publishing many interviews online every week. Whilst we're super excited about this we really don't want the older stories to be lost in a digital archive. We want to pause for a moment and capture some of the best responses we've had in a book, all about the future.</p>

It will also cover a little brand refresh, to design and print some cool postcards, produce a DIY Futures toolkit, and will help toward a book launch event. And, there's a very small contingency to account for the crowd-funding fees and exchange rates.<br/><br/>
Any additional money we raise will be going towards things like hiring a professional editor, invested in the launch events and marketing, and maybe a few surprises in the book as well.

Any additional money we raise will be going towards things like hiring a professional editor, invested in the launch events and marketing, and maybe a few surprises in the book as well. Anything significant will go toward paying a team to design and build a website for ?!X.Exchange RatePlease note that the $/Â£ exchange rate is based on 1.55, the average rate at time of campaign launch. Therefore the donation exchanges are estimations. ?!X are unable to do anything about the exchange rate conversions once donations are made. 




The ?!X Impact & Press
In our first two years, Think Act Vote (?!X) has reached and empowered thousands of people, asking them to consider and to create their own futures. We've received some wonderful support from an array of high profile individuals too - check out what they've been saying about us, here. And, read some of our press coverage here too.

** January Donation SPECIAL! **  Win a chance to dine with TV Historian Dan & ?!X Friends
Everyone who backs us in December 2011 will be automatically entered into a special competition draw. In early January we will be selecting a winner at random to join us on 9th February 2012 for a wonderfully inspiring and unmissable ?!X Dinner in London, with some of our high profile supporters including TV Historian Dan Snow. Exciting stuff!

<h2>About The Golden Lifetree</h2>
<h3>a worldwide project for more light and love</h3>
<p>The Lifetree is a map that helps people to get through the maze of life, right to their deepest core and their own highest truth. Throughout the project ""Golden Lifetree"" Smoenjala paints this very map around the world – branch by branch, root by root.<br/><br/>This way over 500 paintings are composed together like dominoes to a giant Tree of Life, and thus universal love takes on the form of the “Golden Lifetree”. In addition, everywhere, where the caravan of the Golden Lifetree is welcome, Smoenjala paints a personal Tree of Life for the country. This way, expressed by the pictures, a light-grid of universal love embraces the globe.<br/><br/>By purchasing these paintings, as well as by any other type of alternative support, you become a conscious co-creator of this light network, contribute to the growth of the tree of life as well as future projects. One of the fruits of the Golden Lifetree is to be a living “Healing Art Park”, with seminars, concerts, exhibitions, meditations, a holistic place of transformation, a ""Garden of Eden"" from the future in the NOW.<br/><br/>In this garden, an integrated platform is created for children, on which they are supported in different ways to save and evolve their own divine creativity.<br/>Another fruit in the ""Garden of Eden"" is the Golden Pomegranate, a new kind of education space of new age consciousness and creativity through the art of empathy.<br/><br/><br/>… and so the Golden Lifetree always brings new flowers to bloom and new fruits to ripen …</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><img alt=""into the world"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.goldenlifetree.org/files/6813/7061/9059/cf_into_world.png"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 22px; margin-bottom: 22px;""/></h2>
<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<h3>the Initiator Smoenjala and the Golden Lifetree team</h3>
<p>To make the Golden Lifetree blossom and ripe, for the last year, we, a small team of three people, have been dedicating all our love and energy, in volunteer work, have self-financed the project and brought it, to where it is now.</p>
<p>The first fruit that has come to ripen is our internet presence.</p>
<p>¡¡¡ <a href=""http://www.GoldenLifetree.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.GoldenLifetree.org</a> came to see the light of day on April 25 2013!!!<br/><br/></p>
<p>The second fruit is what you are seeing here – the Golden Lifetree fundraising campaign. Presenting a worldwide project for more light and love requires a lot of light and love, thought and dedication, creativity and implementing capacity.  All this has been flowing into our campaign.   <br/><br/>The next flower that is already blossoming and eagerly waiting to be manifested and turn into a fruit is the first Golden Lifetree <a href=""http://www.goldenlifetree.org/en/veranstaltungen/eventgalerie/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exhibition</a> from July 4th - 26th 2013 in San Sebastian de La Gomera (Canary Islands) which initiates the project of the Golden Lifetree.</p>
<p><br/>So this is where we are at the moment. The Golden Lifetree Team has been working voluntarily and so did some of our helpers, from the bottom of their hearts, without anything in exchange. Some artists forgo the payment of their fees but need bed and breakfast. And some work will simply have to be paid. Until now, as we´ve already mentioned above, we´ve self-financed the project in endless hours of volunteer work but now we are about to take the next step, where the Golden Lifetree is to grow into and rise to its true greatness and full potential.<br/><br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","About The Golden Lifetree
a worldwide project for more light and love
The Lifetree is a map that helps people to get through the maze of life, right to their deepest core and their own highest truth. Throughout the project ""Golden Lifetree"" Smoenjala paints this very map around the world – branch by branch, root by root.This way over 500 paintings are composed together like dominoes to a giant Tree of Life, and thus universal love takes on the form of the “Golden Lifetree”. In addition, everywhere, where the caravan of the Golden Lifetree is welcome, Smoenjala paints a personal Tree of Life for the country. This way, expressed by the pictures, a light-grid of universal love embraces the globe.By purchasing these paintings, as well as by any other type of alternative support, you become a conscious co-creator of this light network, contribute to the growth of the tree of life as well as future projects. One of the fruits of the Golden Lifetree is to be a living “Healing Art Park”, with seminars, concerts, exhibitions, meditations, a holistic place of transformation, a ""Garden of Eden"" from the future in the NOW.In this garden, an integrated platform is created for children, on which they are supported in different ways to save and evolve their own divine creativity.Another fruit in the ""Garden of Eden"" is the Golden Pomegranate, a new kind of education space of new age consciousness and creativity through the art of empathy.… and so the Golden Lifetree always brings new flowers to bloom and new fruits to ripen …
 

Behind the scenes
the Initiator Smoenjala and the Golden Lifetree team
To make the Golden Lifetree blossom and ripe, for the last year, we, a small team of three people, have been dedicating all our love and energy, in volunteer work, have self-financed the project and brought it, to where it is now.
The first fruit that has come to ripen is our internet presence.
¡¡¡ www.GoldenLifetree.org came to see the light of day on April 25 2013!!!
The second fruit is what you are seeing here – the Golden Lifetree fundraising campaign. Presenting a worldwide project for more light and love requires a lot of light and love, thought and dedication, creativity and implementing capacity.  All this has been flowing into our campaign.   The next flower that is already blossoming and eagerly waiting to be manifested and turn into a fruit is the first Golden Lifetree exhibition from July 4th - 26th 2013 in San Sebastian de La Gomera (Canary Islands) which initiates the project of the Golden Lifetree.
So this is where we are at the moment. The Golden Lifetree Team has been working voluntarily and so did some of our helpers, from the bottom of their hearts, without anything in exchange. Some artists forgo the payment of their fees but need bed and breakfast. And some work will simply have to be paid. Until now, as we´ve already mentioned above, we´ve self-financed the project in endless hours of volunteer work but now we are about to take the next step, where the Golden Lifetree is to grow into and rise to its true greatness and full potential.

How you can support the project
and help spreading the seeds
You, of course, will want to know, where your money goes to, what it is used for so we have been creative to make it as easy as possible for anyone who wishes to support the growth of the Golden Lifetree and collected a list of ways to do so...  you can support the project through purchasing one or more of our exclusive perks here on indiegogo you can browse through the galleries on www.goldenlifetree.org, purchase paintings and other kinds of art, like music and there’s much more to come, so stay tuned!  you can help us in many different ways. on http://www.goldenlifetree.org/en/verwirklichung/ we created a list of areas in which we will need support on our journey to embrace the light-grid of universal love throughout the globe. Go check it out!   And you can always help to spread the seeds of the Golden Lifetree project throughout the world by sending a friendly link to this indigogo project to your friends and family or even organisations within your reach who you`d think might be interested in collaborating with us!

You can see examples of my works in the gallery tab above. Also on my WEBSITE - <a href=""http://kahlilirving.wordpress.com/portfolio-2/undergraduate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://kahlilirving.wordpress.com/portfolio-2/undergraduate/</a> This will become an awesome crossroads in my design work as I spent a month at the studio during the summer of 2012 studying under my ceramics professor George Timock.  During my time at the ICS I met internationally renowned ceramics artist Ilona Romule. I spent many hours with Ms. Romule which greatly broadened my perspective as an artist and the time that I spent at the ICS inspired me to look deeper into what I really want to share with the world as both an artist and as an individual.  I learned and saw examples of complex mold designs and how industry influences studio ceramic work on a perpetual basis.  Consequently, this international study opportunity has become of great interest to me and is what I would like to present as a basis for the collection making up my senior thesis.  Exploring the use of the mold more in-depth to create objects that solidify an idea of the various architectural elements in which I have once lived is on the forefront of my thinking.  Utilizing the solid white and sheer translucent porcelain strictly used at the ICS in combination with the element of light and various techniques such as sgraffito, china paint, and gold luster I will create a sort of transitory place for the viewer to create implied dimension into my own personal narrative and historical timeline of lifetime events.</p>
<p>Working at the ICS will help polish my artistic skills as a ceramicist due to the participation in individualized workshops designed for established makers in all types of artistic media.  I will be able to also work on and develop my own ceramic collections which as I discussed previously is of the utmost importance.  Developing my skills as an artist will be taken to a whole new realm being immersed in another culture, as well as being surrounded by a diverse group of artists and their unique ideals.  The ability to work alongside these artists who will bring their unique perspectives, experiences, and cultural backgrounds will significantly help broaden my scope and this will be just the beginning of the excitement of my journey.  I also hope to influence other students with my dedication to self-improvement, hard work, and with the story of the hardships I have overcome to become who I am today.</p>
<p>These six months in Hungary will become an invaluable addition to my creative and intellectual development.  It what would normally take many years to gain this type of artistic experience, this trip will help expedite some of the learning process in a matter of a few months.  Everything that I learn and experience will be shared with others so that they may too be influenced to take creative risks as I have learned to do here at the Kansas City Art Institute. Ultimately, this semester abroad will help me to attain my goal of refining my skills as a ceramic artist in order to create beautifully crafted objects that express my ideas in a way that is both innovative and cutting edge as well as grounded in the historical tradition of ceramics.  Most of all, this trip will help to prepare me for the next step in my journey- my Master’s Degree.</p>
<p>I am requesting monetary support that would allow me to embark on this journey.  The funds for this project cover all expenses for my semester overseas: plane ticket, accommodations, material and firing fees, individual workshop fees, technical mold assistance and meals at the center.  All donors will receive a piece of art from my life and I will keep you posted via blog and my Facebook page.  My extended parents Jeff and Emily Tofaute will be sponsoring a senior thesis showing sometime in the late spring of 2014 in St. Louis, MO and I would be most grateful for you to come and see my collection of work I am so ardently yet zealously putting together.  It's going to be one awesome show! Thank you so much for your time and consideration.</p>

I want to fill in the rest of the space with additional imagery from sci fi TV shows and crop cricle images I've pulled from all over the world!
So you have a chance to make art on my body and tell folks you helped me ink my skin!  Here's what you can get in return:
$25 donations will get a signed professionally taken photograph of my with the new ink with my autograph!
$50 donations will get (assuming the donor is over the legal age for adult content in their state) a fully nude erotic photo of me displaying my new ink with autograph and personal message!
$100 donations will get the $50 photo, and a short thank you video emailed to you!
$250 donations get  the $50 photo and a 15 minute live Skype call to chat and allow us to meet and me to show off for you!
$500 donations or more get the $50 photo, the 15 minute Skype call and the chance to have a drink or coffee if we can coordinate a time to be in the same city!


The Impact
As an adult film star, I constantly have to reinvent and maintain my body and its look.  This is tough to do, and I unfortunately am very hyper critical of myself because of it.  Helping me get the newe tattoos, makes me feel better about myself, gives you a chance to say thank you for the work I've done that you've enjoyed, and gives us a connection and something to get excited about!

<strong>Hi! I'm Mary!<br/></strong>I am a young paper-maker and sculptor on my way to refining my craft and achieving my Masters at the University of Iowa's Dimensional Practices Program.  To help fund my move to the university I am harnessing my craft to offer you various artisan papers and sculptures!<br/><br/>
</div>
All Perks will be made on site at the University on both my personal and University equipment. All items are unique, and handmade. </div>

I believe in the ability of nature to heal people and the world.  I fell in love with paper-making while getting my BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and after graduation I passed on my passion by training homeless women in stationary-making as job training. As a result these women gained self-confidence, learned how to express themselves, became employed, and had a renewed sense of possibility.<br/><br/><div><strong>Your Impact<br/></strong></div>

<p><strong>A SPANKING NEW LOGO FOR YOU AND AN EXCITING PROJECT FOR ME. WIN WIN!</strong></p>
<p>Hey I'm Dina, an entrepreneur building a new graphic design company called Logo Juice. My team of graphic designers have over 10 years experience in logo development and we are passionate about creating top notch branding solutions for both companies and start ups alike.</p>
<p>Before we launch our new website <a href=""http://morelogojuiceplease.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">morelogojuiceplease.com</a>, we want to start off this new venture with a bang by offering our services at highly discounted rates! Our goal is to create 100 logos in 100 days to help fill our portfolio page with high quality design. </p>
<p>Once this crowd funding campaign ends and our website is live, our prices will go up over $300! I can guarantee you that you won't find a better deal and a higher quality design service then this anywhere. </p>

<p><strong>EVERY SINGLE BACKER IS GETTING A ONE OF A KIND LOGO!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the big sea of advertising, it is especially tough to set your brand apart. Let’s be honest. Marketing is expensive and for the most part a lot of the logos out there are rushed, thoughtless and just darn right ugly. </p>
<p>Your business is your baby and you want that baby to shine! Help me build my Logo Juice portfolio and I promise to help make your business stand out from the crowd. Each morning I want to pour myself a cup of Logo Juice for my daily serving of spectacular design.</p>
<p>Each backer will receive their logo in the following final formats; png, pdf, and vector eps. Once all of the logos are complete they will be published at <a href=""http://morelogojuiceplease.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">morelogojuiceplease.com</a> for the world to see. Your logo will link to the url of your choice. This not only gives you an awesome online shout out for customers to find your business, but it also contributes to your websites positive SEO. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a special bonus backers will also receive access to my custom lettering wallpaper page. There my backers can download different motivational type wallpapers for all of their smart devices and computers. These wallpapers will be produced while this campaign is live. </p>

<h3>GREETINGS!</h3>
<p>I am Joe Frontel, owner and creator of <em>JF DECKS</em>, an Independently run custom skateboard-design company that produces hand designed wood burnt skateboards. I started this idea about 2 years ago when i moved to Brooklyn, NY from St. Petersburg, FL, as a way to still make work while living in a small space. Growing up skating I always had a draw toward the graphics and aesthetics on the bottom. In Brooklyn, I saw a way to combine handmade fine art with skateboarding to make one-of-a-kind pieces to be hung or skated.</p>
<p>These are one-of-a-kind pieces, I have been doing pyrography (wood-burning) for about 4 years now to make these and have been using the same tool i purchased at Wal-Mart for $20. I have been recieving a lot of attention for the work lately and need to up the ante! Having a more professional wood burning machine would allow me to create higher quality work, and ideally be able to crank out more pieces so more ideas can reach more people.</p>
<p>This campaign is a way for donators to contribute to a DIY skateboard design company, assist me in getting legitimate equipment &amp; supplies, and a chance to recieve original artwork from me in return. Your contributions will be the catalyst to help me turn this passion of mine into a real business!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE SITCH</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The donations will go toward making you happy! How does that work? Well I would love to send you custom art work created by me in exchange for your donation. That should do the trick.</p>
<p>Check out the Perks section for how it breaks down, and how you can get a chance to purchase some art!</p>
<p>But for real:</p>
<p>Donations will help me raise money to pay for a professional wood burning machine, stock up on blank skateboards, non-yellowing UV coating for the pieces, as well as be able to purchase shirts to send out for you all. </p>
<p>Even if the goal is not met, WHO CARES!? You will still recieve the perk you purchased and will forever go down in my heart as a real deal friend. ANY, I mean, ANY way you can help out would be influential to producing more quality art work. Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>So you went back to the land of your ancestors, reconnected to a past that you knew little about and then made art about it?  </h2>
<h3><strong><br/>Exactly! Let me give you a bit of the backstory.</strong></h3>
<p>In the fall of 2009 I was invited to Tábor – a small town in the Czech Republic that most of us have probably never heard of, to do a month-long artist residency in a country I had always longed to get to. This is the same country that 90 years before my own great grandmother, “Old Grandma” as we lovingly called her, boarded a train, and then a ship, and left behind forever. </p>
<p>On the day that I was leaving Canada I heard a voice, a tiny voice in my head, that whispered, “you’re going home.” <br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1145.photobucket.com/albums/o518/jessicaserran/jessicamap600dpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><em>Home? </em></strong></h3>
<p>For those of you who don’t know me, it’s these kinds of signs and synchroncities that I pay attention to. For years, I had wondered about this not-so-distant past, about this land that Old Grandma seemed to long for, and about a language that was quickly losing its place in our family. I had even made paintings and performances to try to reconnect to it.</p>
<p>So there I was, standing in proximity to the soil where she once stood, with paintbrushes in hand and a burning desire to understand this place and the past. Not long after, I even found myself standing in the very room where my grandfather was born.</p>
<p><em>Field Guide to the Czech Psyche</em> was created in this magical realm where the past, my family and my constant wonderings about how we come to be who we are, all came together. It is a collection of notes taken, interviews made and paintings created while I walked this field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1145.photobucket.com/albums/o518/jessicaserran/photosontable600dpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How it looked and what it is:</h3>
<p>During the course of two and half years I talked extensively to nine Czech people. I asked them about everything that I longed to know about this place and all the things that as an outsider, I had permission to ask. This project is about a place, but it is also about something bigger, ancient and much more profound. It is about the pieces of life that make us who we are. It is an investigation into the threads that matter and the things that stick.</p>
<p>This book is personal yes, but it is also more general and recognizes the things that either fall away, refuse to leave or end up being born in some other place altogether.</p>
<p>Nearly three years later, this book, this labour of love, this collection of paintings have all been completed, lovingly edited, translated and readied for print. </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Your generous donations will help to bring this project full circle by sending it to press.  It will also help to create a space where others can explore these magical, known and unknown landscapes and discover their own clues to who we are, how we came to be, and quite possibly, where we’re going. </strong></p>

<h2><strong>Why this campaign is so damn worth funding:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Because holy shit this book is going to be so beautiful! The designer is incredible, the photos are gorgeous, the words of the interviewees will open up new landscapes and the paintings will pull you into magical non-linear terrain where you can pause and let the complexity of it all coexist and be perfect exactly as it is. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Because this is not <em>just</em> about the Czech people, and its not <em>just</em> about a country in the middle of Europe, this is about connecting to what matters most and to what keeps us all connected.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Because this is also about Czech people and for those of us who’ve been here for any length of time we know that we can use all the help we can get!</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Because nine amazing Czechs have opened themselves up to us, fully, and lovingly and are ready to walk us through the landscape of their psyches.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Because these questions, these ancient, profound and connecting questions about who we are and how we came to be, matter. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>And because these images, these paintings are the stuff that sparks magical and meaningful conversations. You'll be amazed. You'll want them around you.<br/> </li>
</ul><h3>And of course, if you can’t contribute financially, how about forwarding this on to your friends, or even just donating one dollar. Just one dollar. That’s less than the cost of a cup of coffee.</h3>
<h3>B<strong>y forwarding it on, and getting this campaign more indiegogo hits, you’ll increase the chances of this campaign going to a whole other level and being featured on the indiegogo home page.</strong>

<h3><strong>And for those of you who might not know me, here’s a bit more of my story:  </strong></h3>
<p>I’ve been an artist, guide and psycho-cartographer for over 10 years; drawing, painting and thrusting myself into foreign territory in cities throughout Europe and North America to dig deeper into the psychological / spiritual / metaphorical terrain that we all travel. I examine the ubiquitous nature of the creative process, and try to find the archetypal threads that run through each new thing that is birthed into the world. As a guide, my specialty is diving into the messy, dark, powerfully transformative layers of the creative feminine by using images and non-linear ways of thinking, helping others to give voice (and visuals) to the sticking points in their own creative processes.</p>
<p>At the moment I live in Prague, was born on a farm in a small town in Southern Ontario, Canada, studied Illustration in Detroit and went on to study Transformative Arts in Berkeley, California. Beautifully, I’ve received grants and awards from the <a href=""http://www.arts.on.ca/site4.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ontario Arts Council</a>, <a href=""http://www.ciis.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the California Institute of Integral Studies</a>, the <a href=""http://www.dswps.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Detroit Society of Women Painter’s and Sculptors</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.culturenet.cz/index.php?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arts Institute of Prague</a>.

</div></div>","(ENG + CZ FRIENDLY!  The entirety of this book has been translated into Czech.)
So you went back to the land of your ancestors, reconnected to a past that you knew little about and then made art about it?  
Exactly! Let me give you a bit of the backstory.
In the fall of 2009 I was invited to Tábor – a small town in the Czech Republic that most of us have probably never heard of, to do a month-long artist residency in a country I had always longed to get to. This is the same country that 90 years before my own great grandmother, “Old Grandma” as we lovingly called her, boarded a train, and then a ship, and left behind forever. 
On the day that I was leaving Canada I heard a voice, a tiny voice in my head, that whispered, “you’re going home.” 

Home? 
For those of you who don’t know me, it’s these kinds of signs and synchroncities that I pay attention to. For years, I had wondered about this not-so-distant past, about this land that Old Grandma seemed to long for, and about a language that was quickly losing its place in our family. I had even made paintings and performances to try to reconnect to it.
So there I was, standing in proximity to the soil where she once stood, with paintbrushes in hand and a burning desire to understand this place and the past. Not long after, I even found myself standing in the very room where my grandfather was born.
Field Guide to the Czech Psyche was created in this magical realm where the past, my family and my constant wonderings about how we come to be who we are, all came together. It is a collection of notes taken, interviews made and paintings created while I walked this field.
 

 
How it looked and what it is:
During the course of two and half years I talked extensively to nine Czech people. I asked them about everything that I longed to know about this place and all the things that as an outsider, I had permission to ask. This project is about a place, but it is also about something bigger, ancient and much more profound. It is about the pieces of life that make us who we are. It is an investigation into the threads that matter and the things that stick.
This book is personal yes, but it is also more general and recognizes the things that either fall away, refuse to leave or end up being born in some other place altogether.
Nearly three years later, this book, this labour of love, this collection of paintings have all been completed, lovingly edited, translated and readied for print. 
Your generous donations will help to bring this project full circle by sending it to press.  It will also help to create a space where others can explore these magical, known and unknown landscapes and discover their own clues to who we are, how we came to be, and quite possibly, where we’re going.

How will the funding be used?  
Three-quarters of the money donated will be used to print the beautifully bound, hard-covered books, designed by the amazing Linda Dostálková, and the 10 poster-sized reproductions of each of the 10 paintings that will accompany them. 
The rest of the funding will cover the cost of design, the gorgeous photographs of both the art and the interviewees taken by the uber-talented Daniela Dostálková, the final proofreading, and the shipping costs associated with sending out all the gorgeous rewards, and…
... it will help to fund the first exhibition of this book and the 10 paintings, which are scheduled to be debuted in Prague, this spring from May 23 – June 24 at the Běhal Fejér Institute. Anything extra will help to put this project on tour!

The designer is incredible, the photos are gorgeous, the words of the interviewees will open up new landscapes and the paintings will pull you into magical non-linear terrain where you can pause and let the complexity of it all coexist and be perfect exactly as it is.

<p><b style=""line-height: 23px;"">Perk pictures available below or at the Gallery.</b><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Hi! My name is Jo, I am a Music Technologist turned t-shirt maker!</span></p><p>In
June 2013 I started bleaching and dying t-shirts. What
began as a hobby, turned into a bigger dream, and I am now starting a
creative arts group that seeks to extend to all art forms. Please help me get it off the ground! There is still much work to do, and much funding is necessary to
get it up to speed!</p>
<h1><b>LTC</b></h1>
<p>Love the Christ has as its most urgent mission supporting anyone who
dreams of getting involved in the arts but lacks a chance. We are specially
concerned with Christians who find it hard to get the expose and support they
need, and are tempted to hide their faith [or put it aside altogether] to get their foot in the door. At
LTC we encourage them to embrace the arts, while holding on to Christ tighter
than before!</p>
<p>My passion and motivation for creating a group such as LTC comes from my own
experience of being rejected in the sound industry simply because of my
quasi-teetotaller lifestyle, i.e. I don’t accept booze as payment.
However, my talent and work ethics are well praised and recognized. Similar situations happen to many talented young artists whom sometimes get the comment,
“You are super talented, but this Jesus thing, it’s gotta go, it doesn’t
sell...”</p>
<h1><b>The Campaign </b></h1>
<p>This campaign was designed to help me get LTC off the ground. I am
looking for exposure, funding, feedback, a customer base, and I also hope that through this campaign new (and experienced) artists may become interested in
joining the team - even at this early stage.</p>
<p>The items here presented are part of LTC’s project <i><a href=""http://www.lovethechrist.co.uk/bleacherize"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bleacherize</a></i>. In this project we transform plain items into something unique, thus
every item is different from any other, and no one else in the world will have
one exactly the same as yours! We have t-shirts to offer (5 of them are truly
special!) and academic diaries. [Scroll down to see item pictures].</p>
<h1><b>The Perks </b></h1>
<p>All the items are unique. They are all transformed by hand, and
include a degree of randomness in their making. You will not find one the same
anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p><b>Mailing List – </b>All contributors
will be added to LTC's mailing list, so please let us know if you would like to

Let’s do it!” I incorporated the message found in Paramore’s lyrics “Hate To
See Your Heart Break” because I thought this t-shirt - and indeed these 5
t-shirts altogether - embody perfectly that message: they have been taken apart, cut, burned, disfigured, put through all kinds of stress and pain,
however, they have been fixed, put together, healed, and the result is more
beautiful now than ever before. This is the message: though we undergo much

was so. I looked at the other t-shirts and the Pain Tee screamed out Taylor
York at me, while the Lyrics Tee screamed out Hayley Williams, so now it was left
to do one in honour of Jeremy Davies. For some reason, and I am not sure why,
the first thing – and only thing – that came to mind were palms. Size is 36'' Chest Fit.</p><h2>What else on perks...</h2>
<p><b>The Lifelong Pack</b> - if you have invested £4403 or more in this campaign, then I want to believe you are passionate about this cause, and you share our desire to make a difference in the world of arts and in the life of artists. LTC would like to keep an on-going relationship with you by forever sharing freebies made by our artists and within our projects. You will receive an item every Birthday, Valentine's Day, Wedding Day/Anniversary (if you are married), 3rd of June (LTC's birthday), and Christmas. Each of them will be accompanied by a short letter with greetings from all at LTC. Your first pack will come after the end of the campaign, containing a t-shirt and a diary made especially for you! - P.S.: You don't need to worry about adding shipping to your order, wherever you are in the world ;)<br/></p><p><b>The One-Year Pack - </b>you will receive everything included in the Life-Time Pack, except only for one year, and the pack includes UK shipping only [if you live in the Channel Islands or anywhere outside the UK please add £48]. Your last pack will arrive approximately on LTC's 2nd anniversary (June 3rd 2015).</p><p><b>Packaging &amp; Shipping</b> – UK Packaging and Shipping is included in all the prices, but please add £8 to your donation if you live in the Channel Islands or anywhere outside the UK.</p><p><b>Fulfilment</b> – perks will be fulfilled as soon as possible, even before the end of the campaign. However, there may be cases where it will take up to the first week of July to complete fulfilment [this is specially true if you live outside the UK, as delivery may span over 1 or 2 weeks].</p><p></p>
<h1><b>The Impact</b></h1>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By donating to this campaign, you will be funding a group that </span>offers a much needed environment of Christ-centreness for young artists.</p><p>The main focus of this campaign isn't to introduce a great product, but to introduce an idea, that became concept, and is now coming into reality! A place where all those who love Christ - and want not to step outside His way - can embrace art with all their efforts, without having to cover up their faith and hide it, but rather proclaim Christ through their artistic endeavour!</p><p>We want to hold on to Christ tighter than before, and we want to embrace art, and we want to bring about a change in society and in the world of art.</p><p>We want to see great artists with a great love for Christ come about and be culturally and morally influential in the world, and a great help in the mission of the Gospel.</p><p>How do you benefit? You will get the first fruits of the work done within LTC. With your contribution you get a unique item, and some of them are the very items that triggered this whole idea! You will be part of LTC's history, and you will retain part of LTC's history!</p><p>The general public will benefit from art that is based not on hatred, profanity nor moral corruption, but on Love, on Christ; from artists whom are not driven by greed nor narcissism, but by humble love and a passion for art and for the Creator!</p>
<h1></h1><h1 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>The Money</b></h1><p>Earlier this year I conducted a similar campaign, the <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2xl-collection"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2XL Collection</a>. This was a campaign in US Dollars (because LTC was in the States for a while!), and it focused on promoting LTC, displaying the work done within <a href=""http://www.lovethechrist.co.uk/life-renewal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Life Renewal</a> (another project within LTC) and helping another Christian ministry. We raised $501 (complete funding!), 60% went to <a href=""http://ptse.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PTSE</a> (more about them below), 21.99% went to Indiegogo fees (including a $25 fee for Non-US bank transfer. Madness!) and what was left was used to pay expenses such as shipping, etc, but it was not enough to cover it all. So, though the campaign was successful and reached goal, the end result left LTC with £5.53 of debt, hence why I am doing a new campaign, but this time I will do things a little different!</p><p>This time, because the campaign is in British Sterling Pounds (£), I am expecting Indiegogo to take 7% if the campaign reaches goal, and 10% of the profit (that is, of the money that gets to us) will go to PTSE. Since the expenses for this campaign have mainly to do with t-shirt prices, packaging, and shipment – which have already been included in the perk values – this should leave LTC with much more substantial profit!</p><p>Why have I set the goal to Indiegogo’s minimum of £500? Because even £270 (approximate profit in a worst case scenario after fees, expenses, and the 10% share to PTSE) would come to great aid! However, if we raise a little or a lot more, then that's great! Another reason I have set it to the minimum is because it helps to ensure we reach the 'safe zone' sooner (that is, avoid Indiegogo taking a bigger share because we haven’t reached goal!) I have set the perk values so that LTC has a good profit margin, and we do not end up in a similar situation as in the previous campaign.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What do we need the money for?</b></p><p>At the moment LTC needs it most desperately for registration purposes. I am still getting LTC registered and up to speed as a corporate body. The money is also necessary to invest on equipment, materials, and supplies! I wish to widen the product range within LTC's yet small online store, and this will require payment of fees and a certain amount of upfront investment! The fashion and recycling &amp; renewal projects have already seen the light of day, but I wish to kick-off photography, creative writing, and short film production projects before the end of 2014 [you can read more on these <a href=""http://www.lovethechrist.co.uk/for-2015"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>]. Going into 2017 I dream LTC will have it's own music label, and a music festival. Basically we are really talking in the thousands if we are going to grow LTC into what I have been dreaming. However, more than funding, we need people, so please get involved! – more on that below.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What if we don’t reach £500?</b></p><p>Like I explained above, any amount of money will be useful, and the exposure alone helps LTC tremendously, but my personal desirable minimum is of £372, to account for expenses and cover the investment made to even produce the campaign.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What is PTSE?</b></p><p>LTC's mission is not only to support new and aspiring artists, but also to use part of the profits to fund Christian ministries all over the world, especially those that are in most need. I have set it as a rule that from now on 10% of all LTC's profit will be invested in a Christian ministry as an offering. PTSE is the only ministry benefiting from us at the moment. They are a Gospel-centred non-profit organisation based in North Florida that raises awareness for human trafficking, and offers help to those addicted to pornography, prostitution, and other types of sexual misconduct. My hope is that LTC will be able to help many other ministries of differing focus in the near future.</p><h1><b>My challenge to you is: no matter how much you give, or what perk you go for, Participate In Positive World Change!</b></h1><p>Here are some ways you can help us further:</p><p></p><ul><li>

<p></p></div>","Perk pictures available below or at the Gallery.Hi! My name is Jo, I am a Music Technologist turned t-shirt maker!In
June 2013 I started bleaching and dying t-shirts. What
began as a hobby, turned into a bigger dream, and I am now starting a
creative arts group that seeks to extend to all art forms. Please help me get it off the ground! There is still much work to do, and much funding is necessary to
get it up to speed!
LTC
Love the Christ has as its most urgent mission supporting anyone who
dreams of getting involved in the arts but lacks a chance. We are specially
concerned with Christians who find it hard to get the expose and support they
need, and are tempted to hide their faith [or put it aside altogether] to get their foot in the door. At
LTC we encourage them to embrace the arts, while holding on to Christ tighter
than before!
My passion and motivation for creating a group such as LTC comes from my own
experience of being rejected in the sound industry simply because of my
quasi-teetotaller lifestyle, i.e. I don’t accept booze as payment.
However, my talent and work ethics are well praised and recognized. Similar situations happen to many talented young artists whom sometimes get the comment,
“You are super talented, but this Jesus thing, it’s gotta go, it doesn’t
sell...”
The Campaign 
This campaign was designed to help me get LTC off the ground. I am
looking for exposure, funding, feedback, a customer base, and I also hope that through this campaign new (and experienced) artists may become interested in
joining the team - even at this early stage.
The items here presented are part of LTC’s project Bleacherize. In this project we transform plain items into something unique, thus
every item is different from any other, and no one else in the world will have
one exactly the same as yours! We have t-shirts to offer (5 of them are truly
special!) and academic diaries. [Scroll down to see item pictures].
The Perks 
All the items are unique. They are all transformed by hand, and
include a degree of randomness in their making. You will not find one the same
anywhere else in the world.

The Lifelong Pack - if you have invested £4403 or more in this campaign, then I want to believe you are passionate about this cause, and you share our desire to make a difference in the world of arts and in the life of artists. LTC would like to keep an on-going relationship with you by forever sharing freebies made by our artists and within our projects. You will receive an item every Birthday, Valentine's Day, Wedding Day/Anniversary (if you are married), 3rd of June (LTC's birthday), and Christmas. Each of them will be accompanied by a short letter with greetings from all at LTC. Your first pack will come after the end of the campaign, containing a t-shirt and a diary made especially for you! - P.S.: You don't need to worry about adding shipping to your order, wherever you are in the world ;)The One-Year Pack - you will receive everything included in the Life-Time Pack, except only for one year, and the pack includes UK shipping only [if you live in the Channel Islands or anywhere outside the UK please add £48]. Your last pack will arrive approximately on LTC's 2nd anniversary (June 3rd 2015).Packaging & Shipping – UK Packaging and Shipping is included in all the prices, but please add £8 to your donation if you live in the Channel Islands or anywhere outside the UK.Fulfilment – perks will be fulfilled as soon as possible, even before the end of the campaign. However, there may be cases where it will take up to the first week of July to complete fulfilment [this is specially true if you live outside the UK, as delivery may span over 1 or 2 weeks].
The Impact
By donating to this campaign, you will be funding a group that offers a much needed environment of Christ-centreness for young artists.The main focus of this campaign isn't to introduce a great product, but to introduce an idea, that became concept, and is now coming into reality! A place where all those who love Christ - and want not to step outside His way - can embrace art with all their efforts, without having to cover up their faith and hide it, but rather proclaim Christ through their artistic endeavour!We want to hold on to Christ tighter than before, and we want to embrace art, and we want to bring about a change in society and in the world of art.We want to see great artists with a great love for Christ come about and be culturally and morally influential in the world, and a great help in the mission of the Gospel.How do you benefit? You will get the first fruits of the work done within LTC. With your contribution you get a unique item, and some of them are the very items that triggered this whole idea! You will be part of LTC's history, and you will retain part of LTC's history!The general public will benefit from art that is based not on hatred, profanity nor moral corruption, but on Love, on Christ; from artists whom are not driven by greed nor narcissism, but by humble love and a passion for art and for the Creator!
The MoneyEarlier this year I conducted a similar campaign, the 2XL Collection. This was a campaign in US Dollars (because LTC was in the States for a while!), and it focused on promoting LTC, displaying the work done within Life Renewal (another project within LTC) and helping another Christian ministry. We raised $501 (complete funding!), 60% went to PTSE (more about them below), 21.99% went to Indiegogo fees (including a $25 fee for Non-US bank transfer. Madness!) and what was left was used to pay expenses such as shipping, etc, but it was not enough to cover it all. So, though the campaign was successful and reached goal, the end result left LTC with £5.53 of debt, hence why I am doing a new campaign, but this time I will do things a little different!This time, because the campaign is in British Sterling Pounds (£), I am expecting Indiegogo to take 7% if the campaign reaches goal, and 10% of the profit (that is, of the money that gets to us) will go to PTSE. Since the expenses for this campaign have mainly to do with t-shirt prices, packaging, and shipment – which have already been included in the perk values – this should leave LTC with much more substantial profit!Why have I set the goal to Indiegogo’s minimum of £500? Because even £270 (approximate profit in a worst case scenario after fees, expenses, and the 10% share to PTSE) would come to great aid! However, if we raise a little or a lot more, then that's great! Another reason I have set it to the minimum is because it helps to ensure we reach the 'safe zone' sooner (that is, avoid Indiegogo taking a bigger share because we haven’t reached goal!) I have set the perk values so that LTC has a good profit margin, and we do not end up in a similar situation as in the previous campaign.What do we need the money for?At the moment LTC needs it most desperately for registration purposes. I am still getting LTC registered and up to speed as a corporate body. The money is also necessary to invest on equipment, materials, and supplies! I wish to widen the product range within LTC's yet small online store, and this will require payment of fees and a certain amount of upfront investment! The fashion and recycling & renewal projects have already seen the light of day, but I wish to kick-off photography, creative writing, and short film production projects before the end of 2014 [you can read more on these here]. Going into 2017 I dream LTC will have it's own music label, and a music festival. Basically we are really talking in the thousands if we are going to grow LTC into what I have been dreaming. However, more than funding, we need people, so please get involved! – more on that below.What if we don’t reach £500?Like I explained above, any amount of money will be useful, and the exposure alone helps LTC tremendously, but my personal desirable minimum is of £372, to account for expenses and cover the investment made to even produce the campaign.What is PTSE?LTC's mission is not only to support new and aspiring artists, but also to use part of the profits to fund Christian ministries all over the world, especially those that are in most need. I have set it as a rule that from now on 10% of all LTC's profit will be invested in a Christian ministry as an offering. PTSE is the only ministry benefiting from us at the moment. They are a Gospel-centred non-profit organisation based in North Florida that raises awareness for human trafficking, and offers help to those addicted to pornography, prostitution, and other types of sexual misconduct. My hope is that LTC will be able to help many other ministries of differing focus in the near future.My challenge to you is: no matter how much you give, or what perk you go for, Participate In Positive World Change!Here are some ways you can help us further:
Share this campaign! This should be the first thing you do, whether you contribute or not. Please share on your social networks, share by word of mouth, share at home, at work, at school, with your church, with your family and friends, with your neighbours, with everyone!
If you are from in and around Hereford, and you would like to give me a hand getting these perks ready, please get in touch.If you are an experienced artist, (or even renowned!) please consider getting involved and helping us! We are keen on learning from artists that love Christ and have been working in the creative arts at a professional level.
If you would like to get involved in the arts, then check out our website! We look forward to take you in and support you as you go through a journey of learning and growing in the arts and in Christ!

Thank you for reading this far! Thank you for checking out the campaign! Thank you for giving! Thank you for getting a perk! Thank you for supporting aspiring artists! Thank you for sharing with everyone you know! In essence, thank you for being faithful to Christ, loving God and being a good neighbour!Jo Pires - Founder of LTCFAQCan I pledge even though I don't have a credit card? Yes.

<p>I hope that no one is disappointed with the results of the campaign which ended today. We did in fact raise over $2000 which will provide 2-$1000 cash scholarships for 2 deserving student veterans next year at SJSU. As a current grad student at SJSU, I can tell you first hand, $1000 is nothing to be disappointed about. Your support made this happen. I can't thank you enough. My love and respect to those of you who contributed so generously and for helping me to promote the campaign. I still have t-shirts already paid for so if you would like to buy one, I will continue to sell them for $20 and then use that money to contribute to the Veteran Student Organization at SJSU, a very worthy cause. Please continue to tell others about the tragedy of veteran suicide, continue to engage with veterans...I know you will! </p>
