exploration into the lives of three Black women who, for different reasons,

share many of their unique experiences and have their understandings of life
challenged. <i>freight.</i> takes a glimpse

<br/><h3>From the playwright:</h3><p>There is a common saying of ""being one illness or accident away from the
 poor house."" For much of the world, the poor house is the structure in 
which they live presently. The risks then of living, are not associated 
with stock options, but with choosing between nutrient rich foods or having enough food to last until the next payday. The risk is in 
choosing between having a day's pay or taking the day off to see a doctor (or spending 12 hours in the emergency room if you are 
uninsured). The risk becomes dealing with the crushing reality of 
uncertainty. The risk, is in finding the space to dream when you are 
intimately acquainted with a profound and persistent lack.</p><p>Like many things that are lingering from the Regan era in 
the United States, the myth of the welfare queen still shames and 
stigmatizes poor women of color; particularly Black women. It manages to
 place all of the burdens imposed by the various systems at play 
squarely on the shoulders of the victims of both active oppression and 
passive neglect. It then mocks these same women when they attempt to 
free themselves from the trap engineered for them. In this decades long,
 one dimensional portrayal of what it means to be poor, Black, Female, 
and a U.S. citizen, yet another aspect of Black womanhood becomes 
profane.</p>
<p><i>freight</i>. was written to largely to dismiss (or at minimum

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>This is a Protest of What Happened </i>examines the ""deconstruction of the administrative state"" through the lens of Italian Futurism smashed against the giddy dread of Donald Trump's favorite musical, Andrew Lloyd Webber's <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>. It is a manic post-logic performance collage, inspired by our manic post-logic world in which everything is a protest of something.</p>
<p>This piece will be performed at The Brick's <strong>THIS IS NOT NORMAL FESTIVAL </strong>on June 24th and 25th of 2017 featuring the work of Dara Malina (Lead Artist), Alexis Roblan (Lead Artist), Kenard Jackson (Performer/Co-Creator), Eunyoung Bona-Jung (Performer/Co-Creator), Gina Manziello (Performer/Co-Creator), Kea Trevett (Performer/Co-Creator), Jonathan Randell Silver (Co-Creator/Sound Designer), Amanda Clegg-Lyon (Lighting Designer), Kadaja Brown (Assistant Director), and Michael Padden (Producer). </p>
<p><b>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT: </b>On November 8, 2016, the world changed dramatically with the election of Donald J. Trump to the Presidency of the United States of America. Since, then we've all been trying to understand what this new administration will do to  the future of democracy and to the world at large.</p>
<p><strong>This Is Not Normal</strong> is an arts festival at The Brick. Replete with weekly cabarets and collective action projects, the festival aims to remind us of the reality we live in and the reality we are moving toward.</p>
<p><i>This is a Protest of What Happened </i>will take a look at the corrosive qualities of the new administration in an attempt to gauge what comes next for all of us. </p>

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT: On November 8, 2016, the world changed dramatically with the election of Donald J. Trump to the Presidency of the United States of America. Since, then we've all been trying to understand what this new administration will do to  the future of democracy and to the world at large.
This Is Not Normal is an arts festival at The Brick. Replete with weekly cabarets and collective action projects, the festival aims to remind us of the reality we live in and the reality we are moving toward.
This is a Protest of What Happened will take a look at the corrosive qualities of the new administration in an attempt to gauge what comes next for all of us.

<i>Juggalicious</i> is a dark comedy about of a group of fans devoted to the music and
theology of the horror-core rap group, The Insane Clown Posse. These
individuals, who define themselves as “Juggalos” have a communal devotion and
adherence to religious and spiritual philosophies put forth through the albums
of this rap group; a group who have been dubbed by Rolling Stone to be the
“worst band in the world”. Yet, the Juggalos are representative of a social
demographic; specifically the ostracized, the alienated, and the impoverished
persons in American society. <i>Juggalicious</i>
strives to explore themes of class-consciousness, the dichotomy between the
privileged and the unprivileged, and in addition the fragmentation of the
nuclear family. At its core, this play is about the human struggle against the
immovable obstacles of poverty and abuse, and the drastic, though often
destructive, measures one may take in order to overcome.<br/><br/><span>        <i>Juggalicious</i> bears a contemporary relevance specifically because of
the recent legal entanglements surrounding The Insane Clown Posse. In 2013 the
FBI elevated the Juggalos to gang status, based merely on a series of isolated
crimes committed by individuals identifying as Juggalos. This, in turn, has
lead to unnecessary harassment by law enforcement officials towards a group of
individuals simply because they have a particular taste in music.  In
response, The Insane Clown Posse has sued the FBI in order to get Juggalos
removed from the FBI’s gang classification. The ACLU recently came to their
aid, and they continue to fight against the criminal stigma associated with
their fans. On a political level, this promises to be a landmark legal case in
Free Speech and will set certain standards in the American Justice system
regarding gang classifications.</span><p><br/></p></div>","JUGGALICIOUSby Britton ButtrillDirected by Celine Rosenthal. What is a Juggalo? Not just a fan of the Insane Clown Posse.

<p>We at <a href=""http://www.7daughtersofeve.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">7 Daughters of Eve Thtr. &amp; Perf. Co.</a> have been developing this piece since 2014, beginning with workshops at Dixon Place and at the formal launch of 7 Daughters at the Martin E. Segal Center on April 6th, 2015. We grew and solidified the piece through independent research initiatives, related performances (see our <a href=""http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/SibylKempson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">12 SHOUTS TO THE TEN FORGOTTEN HEAVENS</a> at the Whitney Museum of American Art) and several residencies at <a href=""http://www.mounttremperarts.org/SibylKempson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mount Tremper Arts</a> in Ulster County, NY, and <a href=""http://www.abronsartscenter.org/artist-residencies/sibyl-kempson/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Abrons Arts Center</a> in NYC. </p>
<p>The SASQUATCH RITUALS are a cycle of site-specific, live ritual performance installations performed by a rotation of six women. They begin with a study of the eyewitness accounts of Sasquatch encounters and are concerned in particular with the patterns of language that American people use on the internet to describe something they cannot explain. They document and contemplate, without metaphor (but not without humor), our spiral-shaped journey researching and investigating the Bigfoot phenomenon in the United States and Canada.  </p>
<p>The SASQUATCH RITUALS are physically performed anecdotal evidence of our relationship to Nature, science and technology, a mapping of the unknown within our selves, our consciousness and our collective &amp; collected mythological memory.  </p>
<p>The ‘truth’ of the elusive, nocturnal forest beings’ existence (or lack thereof) aside, Sasquatch, walking the mysterious line between actual and imagined existence, represents the option each individual has as a birthright: to become part of a greater totality – an opportunity to politely decline the Cartesian separations between mind and matter, individual and environment.   </p>
<p>SASQUATCH RITUALS seek to restore the reciprocity between the hidden presences of the land and the recesses of our American imaginations, bypassing the pressurized and pressuring civilization in its current dark age of disconnection, consumption, and over-accumulation.   </p>
<p>In order to fulfill the shamanic aspect of the RITUALS, the theatrical performances for humans have been balanced by performances for the Sasquatches themselves – on their turf – out in the woods, in locations that evidence a concentration of sightings, at night. That which has been sourced for the purposes of theatrical performance (or anything else for that matter), has also been given back to the land and its hidden populace, by whom we are always watched. </p>
<p>The Kitchen performance was a sharing of our experiences as women in an isolated group, out in the woods, at night, without men or weapons, conjuring a communication with something we cannot see or understand. It includes textual contributions from myself and members of the ensemble Laurena Allan, Lindsay Hockaday, Eleanor Hutchins, Laura Stinger and Sarah Willis, with performances by Maurina Lioce, Linda Mancini, and Jessica Weinstein, music by Julie LaMendola, and Alexis and Lindsay Powell, accompanied by Sound Designer Keenan Hurley and his bandmates Tony Macht and Peter McNally. Costumes by Becky Hubbert, lighting design by Sophie Sotsky, set design by Elena Tilli. Dramaturgy by Clarinda MacLow, Stage Management by Molly Zimmelman with assistance from Leonie Bell, technical direction by Tavish Miller, and we are produced by Sarah Cameron Hughes.</p>
<p>Your FULLY TAX-DEDUCTIBLE contribution will directly support these artists, help us cover rentals of some very special props and make an archival video recording for posterity but also to help us garner interest from other presenters who might extend the life of the project and the production. We hope to bring this work to as many places as we can.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that SASQUATCH RITUALS is a twin project, along with an experimental play with songs entitled THE SECURELY CONFERRED, VOUCHSAFED KEEPSAKES OF MAERY S., written and directed by Sibyl Kempson with music by Graham Reynolds, currently in development with residencies at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, and New Dramatists, winner of a 2016 Frederick Loewe Award for Musical Theater, and is set to premiere in Fall 2018, venue TBA. </p>
<p>If you feel you'd like to help, but aren't able to make a financial contribution, we hope you'll consider sharing this page with others who you think would be interested in supporting. Either way, it will mean a great deal to us! </p>

It includes textual contributions from myself and members of the ensemble Laurena Allan, Lindsay Hockaday, Eleanor Hutchins, Laura Stinger and Sarah Willis, with performances by Maurina Lioce, Linda Mancini, and Jessica Weinstein, music by Julie LaMendola, and Alexis and Lindsay Powell, accompanied by Sound Designer Keenan Hurley and his bandmates Tony Macht and Peter McNally. Costumes by Becky Hubbert, lighting design by Sophie Sotsky, set design by Elena Tilli. Dramaturgy by Clarinda MacLow, Stage Management by Molly Zimmelman with assistance from Leonie Bell, technical direction by Tavish Miller, and we are produced by Sarah Cameron Hughes.
Your FULLY TAX-DEDUCTIBLE contribution will directly support these artists, help us cover rentals of some very special props and make an archival video recording for posterity but also to help us garner interest from other presenters who might extend the life of the project and the production. We hope to bring this work to as many places as we can.
It is also worth mentioning that SASQUATCH RITUALS is a twin project, along with an experimental play with songs entitled THE SECURELY CONFERRED, VOUCHSAFED KEEPSAKES OF MAERY S., written and directed by Sibyl Kempson with music by Graham Reynolds, currently in development with residencies at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, and New Dramatists, winner of a 2016 Frederick Loewe Award for Musical Theater, and is set to premiere in Fall 2018, venue TBA. 
If you feel you'd like to help, but aren't able to make a financial contribution, we hope you'll consider sharing this page with others who you think would be interested in supporting. Either way, it will mean a great deal to us!

<li>FREE MORNING GOSPEL SHOW - With Dustin Jenkins, at 10:30 AM.<br/>
</li> <li>THE GARY WINNINGHAM SHOW - Also free, and Gospel, at 2:00 PM.<br/>
</li> <li>SMOKY MOUNTAIN FRONT PORCH VARIETY SHOW - 4:30 &amp; 7:00 PM.<br/>
</li> </ul>
<p>Our feature show will have a price tag of $24.95 per ticket, BUY ONE GET ONE FREE!  At this value, we should easily fill seats up throughout the entire fall.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We've funded approximately HALF of what we need already, but still have some expenses to cover prior to opening.  Here's a breakdown of what we still need, and the cost of each item.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Video Projector and Screen: $500<br/>
</li> <li>Digital Grand Piano (committed but not yet paid for): $1,200</li>
<li>Initial Order of 5,000 Show Brochures: $500</li>
<li>Initial ""Navigator Magazine"" Show Ad: $2,100</li>
<li>Show and Church Ad In LOCAL Magazine: $1,200</li>
<li>2 Separate Tourist Outreach Postcards for Church services<br/>(1000 qty each): $200</li>
<li>First Month Of Television Commercials For Shows AND Church, Through Tourist Based Visitor's Channel: $700<br/>
</li> <li>Prop Building Budget: $1,100</li>
</ul>
<p>The gift  you give will help us establish a ministry-based journey of church services AND fun family friendly shows, that will touch the lives of countless, and plant seeds that no one could imagine.  People will come to our shows that wouldn't grace the door to a ""conventional church"".  Thus, we have the opportunity to REACH people that would normally not be reachable.  You can be a VITAL part of that.  But, in addition to the joy of blessing others, We have VARIOUS gifts to bless you back with, if you can and will give 
to help us reach this very important goal we have - and we have them on 
several different levels.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Gift Of $20 or More:  Four FREE Tickets To Our Feature Show, ""The Smoky Mountain Front Porch Variety Show, usable ANYTIME this year.  Just pre-reserve your seats.  That's LESS than half of our already low ticket price.</li>
<li>Gift Of $100 Or More (Option One):  Four FREE SEASON PASSES usable for this fall, plus ALL YEAR next year.  That means ANY SHOW we put on, you, along with 3 other people get in completely FREE!  Our normal price PER season pass for one year is set at $100 EACH!  That means you're getting 4 at the price of 1.  Our thank you to you for being our PREMIUM Partner.</li>
<li>Gift Of $100 Or More (Option Two):  1 FREE Custom Track, from Dustin Jenkins Nashville, and a locked in price guarantee for as many tracks as you need and can order in the span of 1 year, whether orchestrated or not, for $100 each thereafter.  The money this gift could save you is UN-calculatable.</li>
<li>Gift Of $500 Or More:  You're our LIFE LONG PARTNER!  You'll get a 3 LIFETIME Season Passes, for the life of our theater and ministry, getting you in to every show we ever produce for life.  In addition, you'll get a special copy of EVERY recording, video and publicity photo/poster we ever produce for the theater, during the pre release time.  That means you'll get yours BEFORE we put it on the table.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Please consider helping us do this.  Your gift of ANY amount will help us accomplish the goal of reaching others for Christ.<br/></p>

FREE MORNING GOSPEL SHOW - With Dustin Jenkins, at 10:30 AM.
 THE GARY WINNINGHAM SHOW - Also free, and Gospel, at 2:00 PM.
 SMOKY MOUNTAIN FRONT PORCH VARIETY SHOW - 4:30 & 7:00 PM.
 
Our feature show will have a price tag of $24.95 per ticket, BUY ONE GET ONE FREE!  At this value, we should easily fill seats up throughout the entire fall.   
What We Need & What You Get We've funded approximately HALF of what we need already, but still have some expenses to cover prior to opening.  Here's a breakdown of what we still need, and the cost of each item. 
Video Projector and Screen: $500
 Digital Grand Piano (committed but not yet paid for): $1,200
Initial Order of 5,000 Show Brochures: $500
Initial ""Navigator Magazine"" Show Ad: $2,100
Show and Church Ad In LOCAL Magazine: $1,200
2 Separate Tourist Outreach Postcards for Church services(1000 qty each): $200
First Month Of Television Commercials For Shows AND Church, Through Tourist Based Visitor's Channel: $700
 Prop Building Budget: $1,100

The gift  you give will help us establish a ministry-based journey of church services AND fun family friendly shows, that will touch the lives of countless, and plant seeds that no one could imagine.  People will come to our shows that wouldn't grace the door to a ""conventional church"".  Thus, we have the opportunity to REACH people that would normally not be reachable.  You can be a VITAL part of that.  But, in addition to the joy of blessing others, We have VARIOUS gifts to bless you back with, if you can and will give 
to help us reach this very important goal we have - and we have them on 
several different levels.

Gift Of $20 or More:  Four FREE Tickets To Our Feature Show, ""The Smoky Mountain Front Porch Variety Show, usable ANYTIME this year.  Just pre-reserve your seats.  That's LESS than half of our already low ticket price.
Gift Of $100 Or More (Option One):  Four FREE SEASON PASSES usable for this fall, plus ALL YEAR next year.  That means ANY SHOW we put on, you, along with 3 other people get in completely FREE!  Our normal price PER season pass for one year is set at $100 EACH!  That means you're getting 4 at the price of 1.  Our thank you to you for being our PREMIUM Partner.
Gift Of $100 Or More (Option Two):  1 FREE Custom Track, from Dustin Jenkins Nashville, and a locked in price guarantee for as many tracks as you need and can order in the span of 1 year, whether orchestrated or not, for $100 each thereafter.  The money this gift could save you is UN-calculatable.
Gift Of $500 Or More:  You're our LIFE LONG PARTNER!  You'll get a 3 LIFETIME Season Passes, for the life of our theater and ministry, getting you in to every show we ever produce for life.  In addition, you'll get a special copy of EVERY recording, video and publicity photo/poster we ever produce for the theater, during the pre release time.  That means you'll get yours BEFORE we put it on the table.  


Please consider helping us do this.  Your gift of ANY amount will help us accomplish the goal of reaching others for Christ.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of young international artists who are passionate about dance, music and filmmaking. In our project, we are combining these artforms to bring them to a broad audience of art lovers as well as people who might not otherwise have access to these artforms. After having created multiple ballets for professional companies around the world, Filipe Portugal is now creating a new choreography specifically for the screen. The ballet will be performed by Emma Antrobus and Luca D’Amato to the piano piece <i>Kaleidoscope</i> by Adriàn Berenguer. Nicole Davidson is the producer and director of this short dance film, which will be filmed by Saro Tschan and Karim Fawaz. Last but not least, Lixel Müller will be doing the sound design for our project. Find out more about what we need and who we are in the sections below!</p>

Cassandra, Ronald and Penelope Klaphake – expected the theatre to be 
completed by September 2005. Construction delays, however, caused a 
slight detour on the theatre's way to settling in at 7701 W. Paradise 
Lane. We forged ahead and opened our first show, ""Anything Goes"", in a 
large pavilion (okay…tent) at the Peoria Sports Complex. Our patrons 
experienced food prepared in a dugout kitchen, an array of daytime and 
nighttime temperatures, baseballs landing on the roof, and street sounds
 at the most inopportune times. (Not to mention one heck of a show!) 
But, our customers endured (as did our employees) and we finally opened 
in our new facility on January 3, 2006. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/anythingGoes7.jpg"" id=""irc_mi"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>""Anything Goes""<br/><br/>Sellout crowds 
packed the new theatre for our second show, Brigadoon. At this time, our
 3,000-square-foot kitchen wasn't complete, and meals had to be catered 
in. The best staging area for this activity was our expansive scene 
shop. Thus, ABT had to purchase or rent sets until the kitchen became 
fully functional. It wasn't until our fifth production, H.M.S. Pinafore,
 that the kitchen, scene and costume shops were all up and running as 
initially planned. (Prior to the building's completion, the costume shop
 had been located in our costume director's apartment: five sewing 
machines in the living room and a work table in one of the bedrooms!) <img align=""right"" alt='""Anything Goes,"" performed in a tent during construction of the theatre' border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://azbroadway.org/images/aboutus/venue/the%20tent.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.azcentral.com/i/4/6/f/M11_CIFR4f131a1976f7329564b4db18a7e16f64.jpg"" id=""irc_mi"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>""H.M.S Pinafore""<br/><br/>Despite

Inc.--and on January 1st the founders literally and seamlessly turned 
the keys to the theatrical operation over to the new entity. With a 
Board of Directors in place, the Association is now responsible for the 
day-to-day activities of the theatre. This approach allows ABT to apply 
for grants from foundations and governmental sources, to lower its 
operating costs and to attract sponsorship and advertising dollars. <br/><br/>Productions
 of the hit show Fiddler on the Roof, followed by Jekyll &amp; Hyde, 
Ain't Misbehavin', The Music Man and Nunsense rounded out our third

 stage capabilities by incorporating a trap door and a multi-level set. 
The holidays were abuzz with activity: tap shoes were flying with Crazy 
for You; ABT performers shown brightly among the 1.5 million lights of 
Glendale Glitters; Peoria Unified School District students entertained 
guests in the lavishly decorated lobby; and the Encore Room took on an 
added dimension by becoming a venue for Mystery Dinner Theatre and a 
special Holiday Cabaret. As 2008 approached, ABT created a new 
not-for-profit organization--the ABT Performing Arts Association, 
Inc.--and on January 1st the founders literally and seamlessly turned 
the keys to the theatrical operation over to the new entity. With a 
Board of Directors in place, the Association is now responsible for the 
day-to-day activities of the theatre. This approach allows ABT to apply 
for grants from foundations and governmental sources, to lower its 
operating costs and to attract sponsorship and advertising dollars. Productions
 of the hit show Fiddler on the Roof, followed by Jekyll & Hyde, 
Ain't Misbehavin', The Music Man and Nunsense rounded out our third 
season, and ABT presented its milestone 1,000th performance. ABT
 continues to strive to be a different kind of dinner theatre, 
presenting you – our loyal patrons – with a venue unique to the 
Northwest Valley. May the curtain continue to rise.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><span>UBCimprov has been an Alma Mater Society Club at the University of British Columbia since 1999. Based in Vancouver and possessing a sizable Alumni population, UBCimprov has become a launching pad for young improvisers and the next generation of Canadian comedians. Last year we became the first Canadian team in the College Improv Tournament, going to the Chicago finals with a Wild Card bid. This year they once again broke new ground, becoming the first Canadian team to come in first at a College Improv Tournament Regional, with unanimous first place votes from all five judges.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What You Can Do</strong></span></p>
<div><span>With great power comes great responsibilities. Now that we have earned our seat in the Chicago finals, we have to get there. That requires funding for transportation and lodging for our team. Unfortunately passion and talent aren't enough to fly to Chicago. Trust us. We tried. The airlines told us that ""dedication isn't acceptable currency."" So this is where you come in. Every dollar gets us that much closer to funding this trip and representing our school, city, country, and the Pacific Northwest in Chicago.</span></div>
<p><span><strong>The Impact</strong></span></p>
<div><span>Vancouver has it's own style of Improvisational Theatre. Like many groups in the Pacific Northwest, we are funny, clever, witty, and good looking. However, we spice the pot up a little bit with something we think is pretty unique to Vancouver improv and UBCimprov: sentimentality. We try to tell meaningful stories with characters the audience loves. Through the guise of improv we explore our own lives, question our own beliefs, share our personal thoughts, and experience journeys that change our lives. By performing on stage we hope to share what we learn with our audiences. By performing in Chicago we hope to spread the love and therapeutic value of Vancouver improv with Improvisers around the continent.</span></div>

What is it all about?
Based on a true story, SOUNDWAVES: The Passion of Noor Inayat Khan is a play about a young Sufi woman of Indian descent, a children’s writer, musician and daughter of a great Indian musician and Sufi master, who flees her father’s spiritual center in France in before the Nazi onslaught. This devotee of Gandhi’s non-violence re-emerges as the heroine of the French Resistance known as “Madeleine” – and one of the most highly honored heroes of the struggle against Nazism in France and England – whose only weapons was a radio.
SOUNDWAVES: The Passion of Noor Inayat Khan was presented in October 2012 as a staged reading in “readers theatre” format at the Brecht Forum in New York's West Village.
The international Italian theatre information/review website Teatroteatro.it praised the performance for “[...] mov[ing] between detailed historical description, on the one hand, and the parallels of spiritual and Islamic mysticism on the other,” and concluded that “[...] SOUNWAVES fascinates and enchants the audience with the beauty of its text and the energy of its cast.”
The play is a homage to Noor Inayat Khan and functions as a reminder of the power of Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance. Noor is a symbol for spiritual and moral values in times of crises, a paradigm for the fight against evil without losing one's integrity.

<h3> </h3>
<p>Sierra Madre Playhouse, located in Sierra Madre, California, asks for your support to help us mount <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>, a specific and universal story by Susan Kim adapted from the novel by Amy Tan. The story is an intergenerational tapestry of stories of immigrant mothers and their American daughters.</p>
<p>Located in the San Gabriel Valley, the Sierra Madre Playhouse, draws from the rich cultural traditions of local residents.  Over some forty theatrical seasons, experience tells us that audience members' own stories enrich and expand the work on stage.  This is a dialog between actor and audience member that makes theater such an enduring artistic tradition.  We are anxious to offer <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> to the Chinese and Chinese-American residents of our community, in particular, yet equally, every audience member representing other cultural roots to join in its universal wisdom.</p>
<p>We are thrilled that Tim Dang returns to direct THE JOY LUCK CLUB at Sierra Madre Playhouse. Having previously run East West Players, the longest running theater of color in the United States and the largest producer of Asian American artistic work, he continues to share the rich cultural experience of the Chinese in America with the greater community that is vital to his work as a director as well as a long-time activist in cultural equity and inclusion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Sierra Madre Playhouse is seeking to raise $15,000 from this campaign that is over and above the average cost of a non-musical production at our intimate theater due to the large cast size of eleven that this production requires. There are also technical elements of this production that make this an expensive undertaking such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video projections to convey a cinematic sweep of time and space as we segue from story to story.</li>
<li>Period costume designs to portray the dress from 1920s China to 1980s America.</li>
<li>A cast size of eleven that will be paid under the 99-seat Actors Equity Plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your generosity of a tax-deductible contribution, some of the exciting perks of being able to share these heartwarming stories - some hilarious, some heartbreaking - includes email updates about the production process from the first day of rehearsal through Opening Night, a production program autographed by the cast, an exclusive invitation to a rehearsal, and tickets to a performance of the production. We want to include you as part of the Joy Luck Club Family.</p>
<p>We feel confident that we will reach our goal of $15,000. In fact, we are prepared to expand our goal to include other engagement activities that will help to build bridges with the surrounding communities through post-performance talkbacks, ""meet the artists"" forums, an informative lobby exhibit about the Chinese in America, and an opportunity for a film series about the Chinese American experience during the run of <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your financial support will contribute to ensuring a top caliber production of <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> with artistic integrity that is the cornerstone of Sierra Madre Playhouse's artistic mission.</p>
<p>Your support will enable Sierra Madre Playhouse to expand our reach to surrounding neighborhoods such as Pasadena, Arcadia, San Marino, and other San Gabriel Valley cities by sharing stories familiar to the Chinese and Chinese American communities.</p>
<p>Your support will entertain, educate, and enlighten all who walk through the doors of the Sierra Madre Playhouse through your participation in cultivating and deepening relationships with our neighbors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The importance of ""art"" is that ""art"" tells a story. Art is all about the story. Through stories (and The Joy Luck Club has many stories), we can start the dialogue between all of us on many issues. The art brings us together to understand different points of view. Sierra Madre Playhouse is taking this step to build our community, our neighborhood, and to build relationships. Our world needs to build community, and what better way than through art.</p>
<p>*The Joy Luck Club may be too specific for me to connect to.</p>
<p>Though The Joy Luck Club is about the relationships between four Chinese immigrant mothers and their four American daughters, there are universal themes that come out of the specificity and authenticity of these stories. The stories are so touching that every adult daughter (and son) who has a deep relationship with their mother can relate to in a multitude of ways. The stories on stage guide the audience member through their own tapestry of life stories. Through The Joy Luck Club, you will experience your own tapestry of life stories.</p>
<p>*There is a lot of TV, film and theater productions competing for my time.</p>
<p>Sierra Madre Playhouse is committed to artistic integrity. Our past productions have been recognized by both theatre reviewers and audience members of the quality of our theatrical offerings. Your time will be well spent experiencing The joy Luck Club at the Sierra Madre Playhouse.</p>
<p>Tim Dang will direct the stage production of The Joy Luck Club. He is the producing artistic director emeritus of East West Players, the longest running theater of color in the United States and the largest creator of Asian American artistic work for the stage, having run the organization for 23 years. An excellent design team has been assembled to support the vision of the play. Tim is a director with great sensitivity bringing his unique talent to the production making it more than a play about the Chinese-Americas experience but a great play with universal appeal about intergenerational family relationships.</p>

<p><strong>The Creation</strong></p>
<p>The Monstress Mess production of 'The Stronger' is a theatre performance which replicates the way the human mind functions on the stage; both through the way the text is structured and through the design elements. A psychological puzzle and an immersive blow-your-mind live experience. </p>
<p>The story ultimately hinges on the link between perception and reality: how well do we really know the people closest to us? How well do we really know ourselves? Think Groundhog Day for the Berlin elite. The audience are trapped in a time loop with the guests present at the bourgeois Christmas networking benefit at the luxury Charlottenburg apartment of Mr and Mrs X. </p>
<p>1 Text. 2 Women. 4 Versions. </p>
<p><strong>Why is Strindberg in a time loop?</strong></p>
<p>The setting for this Monstress Mess production is: Christmas, 2019, Berlin. Strindberg originally wrote the play in 1888. He was writing about, what was a new problem at the time; the way we trap ourselves in a cycle of thought and a pattern of behaviour which we cannot escape from. He was predicting a mental health epidemic at a time when people were moving away from the structure of religion, tradition and more pressing for Strindberg; the rise of the emancipated woman threatening the male dominance of society. </p>
<p>The story centres around the relationship between married Mrs X and single Miss Y, who once had a very close relationship but something happened causing them to drift apart which they have never spoken about...until the play begins. The inspiration for the time loop came from Strindbergs ideas on cycles of thought and the process before a confrontation that everyone experiences (whether consciously or unconsciously) where you imagine what you might say to this person and how they might react. You also imagine multiple possible reasons for them to act the way that they did. In this production the audience will have front row seats to this process in Mrs X's mind playing out on the stage. We will be observing her stream of consciousness. The avatars of her loved ones and acquaintances will show us the power and the possibilities of the imagination. </p>
<p><strong>The Details</strong></p>
<p>The Stronger will premiere on May 2 at Brotfabrik in Berlin. We have chosen the venue due to its immersive qualities; it allows us to take our audience on a journey on which we can reveal secrets along the way. </p>
<p>Director Rebecca Scott has been exploring the possibilities, and pushing the relationship, between theatre and psychology throughout her studies and career. Rebecca was born in Sydney Australia in 1988. She lived and studied as an actress in Sydney (Actors Centre), New York (Lee Strasberg Institute) and London (RADA) before coming to Berlin to study theatre directing. However her most important education was working with renown Australian acting coach Annie Swann. </p>
<p>Whilst transitioning into directing in Sydney, Rebecca completed directing internships at the Ensemble Theatre, Sydney Theatre Company, Sport for Jove and the John Bell Shakespeare Company. In the last 3 years she was granted directing internships working with Katie Mitchell at the Schaubühne Berlin and the Deutsches Schauspielhaus Hamburg, and with Barrie Kosky at the Komische Oper. She has also worked as an assistant director to Kim Hardwick of White Box Theatre Sydney, Erman Jones of the Berlin English Repertory Theatre and Glen Sheppard in Berlin. In April 2019 she directed a production of Chekhov’s ‘The Proposal’ at Studio 800a Berlin. </p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The scale of this project is massive and involves an array of artists, storytelling professionals and technical equipment. The funds for the execution of the project are the primary challenge we are facing at the moment. Contributions we collect will be arranged to cover various parts of the project, as all are interdependent to pull off the production. To be able to pay these professionals and cover our expenses in putting on the show we need at least 10,000 euros.  It is important for us to be able to pay our team what they deserve for their artistic contributions to the project. </p>
<p>Where is that money going?? Here are just some of the costs. </p>

It is very important for us to be able to document our work, with good quality photography and videography, to allow us to apply for other types of funding in the future and so we do not need to rely on only support from our community in the future. </p>
<p>We have developed amazing perks so that you will not only invest in a great team but you will also get something unique back in return - sponsored by our wonderful and generous community of artists who want to support us.</p>

We have developed amazing perks so that you will not only invest in a great team but you will also get something unique back in return - sponsored by our wonderful and generous community of artists who want to support us.
We also want you to feel as proud to be part of The Stronger as we are.
The Support
We also know that not everyone will have the means to donate. If you are able to share support in other acts of loving kindness, we would super appreciate:
Sharing the campaign link with your friends via email, text, social media - every dollar counts
Talk about The Stronger online - share the visuals (i.e the campaign videos) for promotion
Follow Monstress Mess on Facebook and Instagram for production updates that could be relevant to you - (maybe we even tour The Stronger to your part of the world!)
In any case, your support in whichever form, means the world -- both the physical and virtual 
Yours,

<h3>The Nitty Gritty</h3>
<p>Robert Moses' Kin's <b><i>20th Season </i></b>is here! In celebration of our two decades of consistently offering compelling, powerful and unique work, RMK is on the cusp of a performance season like no other. Commissions, travel, collaborations, educational partnerships - they are all lined up in what will truly be a season of firsts. Fitting to this theme of firsts is this invitation from Sapphire Dance, Eastern India's only experimental dance company that exudes a ready awareness of contemporary global concerns, to perform at the INTERFACE 2014, a biennially running festival since 2002. The festival is a major event in the cultural calendar of India, covering all artistic disciplines of performing and visual arts. </p>
<p>We are sending Robert Moses along with 4 Company Dancers. They will travel to 3 different cities along the 12-day tour: New Delhi, Chandigarh, and Calcutta In addition to performing on this multi-city <span style=""color: black; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">tour, RMK will have opportunities to teach young people who may not otherwise have access to such high-quality instruction from an international, professional choreographer and instructor.<i> Exciting, right?</i> We are honored at the chance because aside from performing, teaching the next generation is one of our favorite things to do!</span></p>

We and are reaching out to the community so that for such a special occasion, we're not reaching into the funds we plan to use to produce our 20th season.

<h3>Death Goes on Strike</h3>
<p>Around 1943 the composer Viktor Ullman and librettist Peter Kien were prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp where they composed a beautiful and darkly funny allegory about mechanized war where the character of Death, feeling quite put out at the extra work, goes on strike. When the Nazi's found out they shut down rehearsals and eventually sent both men to Auschwitz where they were murdered.</p>

<li>Hi, I'm Aaron Vega. I've been creating theatrical pieces since I was old enough to tell stories and I'm excited to create this piece for Denver audiences in such an unexpected locale.</li>
<li>The opera DER KAISER VON ATLANTIS is startlingly relevant to our culture today. By making older pieces new again with exciting designs, concepts and comfortable locations, we can renew discussions to issues that still plague our modern society. And, hopefully, find resolutions through humor and imagination.</li>
<li>By funding this project through small donations we're able to stay true to our mission of being dedicated to integrity and design and provoking the imagination through socially relevant storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our first project in the Denver area and we are excited to bring this "" high-brow bar art"" to this exciting arts community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's easy to find live entertainment, but it's not as easy to find live entertainment that has integrity.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's easy to dismiss opera, theatre or puppetry as non-essential to society. With so many problems plaguing our world why should you throw money at a puppet opera in a bar? The answer is easy. Because good Art makes our society a better place. It's that simple.</li>
<li>By funding artists with proven track-records of high-quality performance and design you're contributing to everything that makes Denver fun, funky, and worth living in. Not only is the show entertaining but it stirs conversation, and conversation stirs change and change creates a better society. With top-notch designers, singers, director and puppeteers you'll enjoy this opera, think deeply, and have a drink in your hand. That's something worth supporting.</li>
<li>Join us in our adventure to make high-quality Art in accessible locations. It's the future of live theatre and you'll be happy with what we can create together.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the nitty-gritty:</p>
<ul>
<li>While live entertainment can often be quite expensive to produce we're only asking for $7,000. This project is a labor of love and we're dedicated to keeping the focus on the art. These funds will go toward stipends for the artists involved but also toward a compact and flexible lighting and sound system that will allow us to bring pieces like this one to locations where Denver folks want to go anyway.</li>
<li>We've got tickets to the show, personalized videos and even specialty cocktails for donors! So jump on in and give what you can.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal the funds we raise will go into our general fund where we can use them to reach out to more donors in the future to make this project happen. We're tenacious and won't give up.</li>

The documentary, Ze’eva Cohen: Creating a Life in Dance, 
describes how it was possible to thrive artistically and even survive 
economically as an independent artist in the world of dance.The film encompasses her life as a dance student in pre-independent Israel to her work in the USA: as soloist with Anna Sokolow's Dance Company; her pioneering solo repertory concerts; as dancer and choreographer for her company, Ze'eva Cohen and Dancers; and for some of the twenty-nine national and international companies with whom she worked.  The film also documents her important educational work at Princeton University, whose dance program she founded and directed from 1969 to 2009.
The Beginning of the ProjectThe collaboration of dancer and choreographer Ze’eva Cohen and film editor and producer Sharon Kaufman, a former senior editor at ABC television, expands on and further develops a film they co-produced for a private showing in the spring of 2010 for a retirement tribute concert celebrating Cohen’s contributions to the dance program at Princeton University.The two met in 2009, when they were each about to retire from 40 years of work in their respective careers; Ze'eva was hoping to find an editor to help create a short documentary of highlights from her career that began in the 1970's to be shown at her retirement gala. The goal of that project was to communicate to the Princeton University community the breadth of Ze’eva’s career in dance outside of academia.  At the same time, Sharon was exploring creative possibilities after years of editing for ABC's ""20/20."" Thus, the project was born.The audience response to the film was overwhelmingly enthusiastic, and it became clear that the 25-minute documentary could become the basis of a legacy project covering Ze’eva Cohen’s fifty years of work, not only as a luminary dancer and choreographer, but also as a pioneer in building a comprehensive dance program in a widely respected university dance program.To more fully detail and explore her contributions to dance, the documentary will demonstrate how Ze’eva was able to produce highly original work while building a serious dance program in an elite academic environment.

Current Status of the Project
In early 2013, Cohen and Kaufman set out to complete their documentary, which now includes historical highlights of the Princeton dance program and interviews with four unique dance artists who studied under Cohen at Princeton University. Since leaving Princeton, these artists, Jose Mateo '74, David Rousseve '81, Jill Sigman '89 *98, and Mariah Steele '06, have themselves been creating important, challenging, and thought-provoking work with their own dance companies.
Audience for the DocumentaryThis documentary will illuminate the life of an artist from the 1960s - 2013, and will, by example, influence and inspire future generations of artists in dance, lovers of dance, and those who might choose any independent artistic journey.

Financing of the Project to Date
To date, the costs of producing the original film total $18,900. A $6,500 grant from Princeton University in 2009-10 helped advance the project, and the balance of $12,400 was financed by the Ze’eva Cohen Dance Foundation, a not-for-profit arts organization.

dynamic festival such as Edinburgh Fringe and we hope to raise awareness
amongst the Fringe audience about the deadliness of isolation, loneliness and the disregard for, not just our elderly population, but anyone who suffers in
silence with depression and no one to turn to.  We also hope to, in
conjunction with elderly charities, help make people aware of the urgent need
to reduce the level of abuse and attacks on the elderly, (particularly violent and often sexual assaults) and ensure victims have
better access to appropriate support. 
Tackling often unspoken social issues on how we perceive old age and mental health. Where do the isolated ""fit "" in a society that often disregards and feels uncomfortable, when faced with imperfection and suffering?The inspiration to produce and perform 'Teaset' began
after a personal loss and a strong feeling that our elderly generation
desperately need treated with more respect, equality and dignity. 'Tea set' became the perfect vehicle and voice
to express the importance of these topics and open up a dialogue about
them. 
“I related to the piece totally yet it was still mysterious and
playful. I lost my paternal Grandmother on Christmas Eve last year. She was
like another Mum to me and, I felt, was largely ignored and marginalised by her
doctors as her illness progressed. Much like Mrs. A, she was increasingly
overlooked by the world around her. l feel very strongly about improving care
of the elderly and achieving better approaches to dealing with depression and
mental health. As a society we tend to value youth and perfection above all
else these days and it has some terrible consequences.” 
                                                                                   —— actress Amy Molloy“Tea Set is a deeply unsettling play about our forgotten elderly living in fear and isolation and the effects this neglect can have on our future generations.”                                                                                    ——artistic director Sharon Willems.Press Response

<h3>Synopsis of the play</h3>
<p>After a violent family tragedy, in which their mentally-ill mother took the life of their little sister; three children are placed in the home of their loving, patient and elderly Great-Aunt Eveline in North London. Charlie, a sensitive and mature teen, is Eveline’s ally and a voice of calm in the chaos created by her older sister, Penelope. She, on the other hand, is the instigator of chaos and mayhem in the formerly-childless Eveline’s life. Suffering from mental illness and traumatized by the death of her sister, she is at once angry, needy, rebellious, mean, and confused but also loving toward her boyfriend, Jamie. William, better known as Whizzer, is the youngest and most sensitive of the trio, tormented by Penelope and a bit of a bed-wetter. In the course of one tumultuous evening, Penelope and the rest try to work through some of their demons and wrestle with mental illness, the lingering trauma from their sister’s murder and the concept of mortality.</p>

<h3>Who Am I? What is This?!</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Kevin McAuliffe and this is my first stand-up comedy one man show! I was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and I grew up in Missoula, MT. I recently graduated with a BFA  in acting from the Theatre Conservatory at the Chicago College of Performing Arts. From a very young age I loved comedy, especially stand-up, but I was really nervous about doing it in high school and I also did not have the opportunity to do so. Then in college I decided to give it a try. The first time I did the standing up and the comedy thing was during my sophomore year for a project for my class called, ""The Story of My Voice."" I did nine minutes, which is a lot for a first time, and it went well. Two years later, I got cast in a performance art show at my school and I did stand-up for it. That time I wrote 12 minutes and the performance ended up being 19 (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uK7owgp_c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uK7owgp_c</a>). That was my second time doing stand-up. After that performance, I wanted to do more work like that. Since graduating, I have been doing open mics in Chicago.</p>
<p>The show is called ""Hello, My Name is Kevin,"" where I tell stories about my life, and why I am the way I am. The reason why this show is different from other one man shows is because it's told from my weird point of view towards life.

Hello my name is Kevin McAuliffe and this is my first stand-up comedy one man show! I was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and I grew up in Missoula, MT. I recently graduated with a BFA  in acting from the Theatre Conservatory at the Chicago College of Performing Arts. From a very young age I loved comedy, especially stand-up, but I was really nervous about doing it in high school and I also did not have the opportunity to do so. Then in college I decided to give it a try. The first time I did the standing up and the comedy thing was during my sophomore year for a project for my class called, ""The Story of My Voice."" I did nine minutes, which is a lot for a first time, and it went well. Two years later, I got cast in a performance art show at my school and I did stand-up for it. That time I wrote 12 minutes and the performance ended up being 19 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uK7owgp_c). That was my second time doing stand-up. After that performance, I wanted to do more work like that. Since graduating, I have been doing open mics in Chicago.
The show is called ""Hello, My Name is Kevin,"" where I tell stories about my life, and why I am the way I am. The reason why this show is different from other one man shows is because it's told from my weird point of view towards life.

This is not a Viveca Vázquez Piece  


 


Short Summary

To celebrate renowned Puerto Rican choreographer and dancer Viveca Vázquez’ 30-year career, the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC) has organized a retrospective exhibition about her work entitled A Choreography of Error: Viveca Vázquez’ CONDUCT.  The exhibition, which opened to the public last April, has been curated by scholar Nelson Rivera and includes video and documentary material. A rich education program has been designed integrating forums, artistic workshops, and,–as part of the MAC Live Workshop Program– performances of some of Vázquez’ pieces. The exhibition project opened to the public with a performance that merged a selection of some twelve choreographic excerpts, original costumes, and video art material directed by Viveca Vázquez, in which she also performed with ten other dancers who have collaborated with her in the past. Amongst these is José Pepe Álvarez, her co-director for this repertory, who has been immersed in Vázquez’ work for the past ten years as student, dancer, and now colleague.

*This interdisciplinary project is now open to the public and will run through September 22, 2013.


For the project finale, Viveca Vázquez invited José Pepe Álvarez to direct the closing events, which include a forum and a closing performance that he has titled ¨This is not a Viveca Vázquez Piece¨ (¨Esto no es una pieza de Viveca Vázquez¨).  

José Pepe Álvarez is re-visiting her conceptual and aesthetic propositions by using archive material, such as performance recordings, interviews and articles about her work, to reformulate those experimental art principles. He is highlighting her movement invention and its relation to language, which Vázquez has endowed with urban Caribbean as well as with race, gender and queer attributes in the context of Puerto Rico’s sociopolitical situation. 
 

Resumen del proyecto

En celebración de los treinta años de carrera de la renombrada bailarina y coreógrafa puertorriqueña Viveca Vázquez, el Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Puerto Rico (MAC) ha organizado la exhibición retrospectiva: Coreografía del error: CONDUCTA de Viveca Vázquez. La exhibición, abierta al público el pasado mes de abril, ha sido curada por el estudioso Nelson Rivera e incluye material fílmico y documental. Un variado programa educativo ha sido diseñado para el proyecto, incluyendo foros, talleres artísticos y –como parte del programa de Taller Vivo del MAC– performances de algunas coreografías de Viveca Vázquez. CONDUCTA abrió al público con una presentación que recogía doce fragmentos de una selección de piezas coreográficas que junto con vestuarios originales y piezas de video arte, fue dirigida por Viveca Vázquez quien también participó como bailarina junto a su co-director José Pepe Álvarez y diez performeros de distintas generaciones que han colaborado con ella en el pasado. Álvarez ha estado inmerso durante diez años en el trabajo de Viveca Vázquez como estudiante,  bailarín y ahora colega. 

En este momento y para el final de esta retrospectiva, Vázquez invita a José Pepe Álvarez a dirigir los eventos de clausura de CONDUCTA que incluyen un foro y un performance que el denomina ¨Esto no es una pieza de Viveca Vázquez¨ Para esta pieza, Álvarez re-visitará los postulados conceptuales y estéticos de la coreógrafa usando su material de archivo tales como documentaciones de sus piezas, entrevistas y artículos sobre su trabajo para re-formular su propuesta experimental.  Álvarez hace particular énfasis en su invención de movimiento y su relación con el lenguaje que Vázquez atribuye en asuntos sobre raza y género, contextualizados en la situación social y política de Puerto Rico.   


 


 The project 


¨This is not a Viveca Vázquez Piece¨ works with different raw materials from Vazquez´ archive to extract them from their original context. The audience will be invited to travel with Álvarez and other performers around two empty gallery spaces on the first floor of the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art,: the courtyard and the gallery where the CONDUCTA exhibition is presented. This journey will be guided by performative gestures, movement improvisations, video installations and other theatrical resources to articulate this performative inquiry. Álvarez’s ten-year experience working with Viveca Vázquez will allow him to contextualize all of this through a dialogue with some aspects of his own solo works. 


The audience is going to experiment Alvarez´ interpretation of some of Vázquez’ pieces, performed by and through his own body, and also his appropriation of some non-choreographic materials. These he will reformulate into a live installation that will incorporate her video and sound works, originally created for dance pieces, here re-signified for a museum context. 


Álvarez’ co-director is Arnaldo Rodríguez-Bagué, who is also working on Vázquez’ retrospective and whose interest in Vazquez´ works comes from the fields of visual anthropology and video art. For ¨This is not a Viveca Vázquez Piece¨, Álvarez is formulating with Rodríguez Bagué a comparative montage of Vazquez’ video works and those by experimental artist Maya Deren. 


One aspect of this piece is the reinterpretation of one of Vazquez’ most important video pieces, ¨Las Playas Son Nuestras¨ (¨The Beaches are Ours¨), which focuses on the environmental and political issues related to the US military practices carried out in and around Vieques, a small island off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. This video piece, recorded in 1990 with professional dancers and related to one of the most intractable political situations of the time, is now brought into a different sociopolitical context, as relevant today as the US military occupation of Vieques was some years ago. A group of seventeen- and eighteen-year old immigrant residents of the Dominican community of Barrio Obrero will be part of his “re-writing” of this video, which focuses on immigration, environmental, social and health issues caused by the contaminated waters of El Caño Martín Peña, a mangrove channel located in the center of the San Juan metropolitan area which is part of their community. . 


Additionally Álvarez is going to direct Viveca Vázquez as a dancer and performer by re-staging a selection of one of her pieces. 


CONDUCTA’s closing event –at the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art– seeks to underscore Vázquez’ contribution to dance and theatre as well as reflect upon the connections between her body of work and that of younger generations of contemporary artists in Puerto Rico. It also presents an approach to Vázquez’s work through another, younger artist’s perspective who wishes to contribute to the theoretical and critical production that gives continuity to the contemporary arts in Puerto Rico. 

 

El proyecto


 ¨Esto no es una pieza de Viveca Vázquez¨ se sirve de los materiales de archivo de Viveca Vázquez y los saca fuera de su contexto original. El público será invitado a recorrer con José Pepe Álvarez y otros performeros las dos galerías del primer piso del Museo de Arte Contemporáneo incluyendo el patio interior y la galería donde la exhibición CONDUCTA está ubicada. Este recorrido será guiado por gestos performáticos, improvisaciones de movimiento, coreografías, instalaciones de video y recursos teatrales que articularán este performance investigativo. ¨Esto no es una pieza de Viveca Vázquez¨ recoge la experiencia de Álvarez colaborando con Vázquez estableciendo así, un diálogo entre la obra de Vázquez y algunos aspectos formales y temáticos de su obra como solista. 


El público experimentará la re-interpretación corporal de Álvarez sobre algunas piezas de Vázquez así como también la apropiación de materiales no coreográficos junto con otros materiales ¨crudos¨ no utilizados del archivo de la coreógrafa. En estas reformulaciones Álvarez utilizará también material de video-arte junto con algunas bandas sonoras, originalmente creadas para piezas escénicas y de movimiento, para así resignificarlas en una ¨instalación viva¨ dentro del contexto del museo. 


Álvarez trabaja en colaboración con su co-director Arnaldo Rodríguez Bagué, quien también colabora en CONDUCTA. El interés de Rodríguez Bagué en el trabajo de Viveca Vázquez proviene de los terrenos de la antropología visual y el video arte. Para¨Esto no es una pieza de Viveca Vázquez¨ Álvarez está formulando junto a Rodríguez Bagué un montaje visual comparativo entre el trabajo de video-arte de Viveca Vázquez y los videos experimentales de Maya Deren.


Otro de los aspectos importantes de ¨Esto no es una pieza de Viveca Vázquez¨ es la reinterpretación de una de las piezas de video mas importantes de Vázquez, ¨Las playas son nuestras¨, la cual enfoca en los asuntos políticos y ambientales causados por las prácticas militares de EEUU llevadas a cabo en Vieques, una pequeña isla municipio ubicada en la costa este de Puerto Rico. Esta pieza de video, filmada originalmente en 1990 con bailarines profesionales, basada en una de las situaciones políticas mas insuperables de nuestros tiempos, es ahora llevada a una situación sociopolítica diferente pero igualmente relevante como la ocupación militar de EEUU en Vieques hace unos años atrás. Un grupo de jóvenes entre 17 y 18 años de la comunidad dominicana de Barrio Obrero serán parte de la ¨re-escritura¨ de este video enfocado en la inmigración y los problemas sociales, ambientales y de salud causados por las aguas contaminadas del Caño Martín Peña, un manglar localizado en el centro del área metropolitana de San Juan donde se encuentra su comunidad. Adicional a esto Álvarez dirigirá a Viveca Vázquez para una de las re-formulaciones de sus piezas. 

Los eventos de clausura de CONDUCTA pretenden resaltar las contribuciones de Vázquez en el teatro y la danza así como reflexionar sobre las conexiones entre su cuerpo de trabajo y el de generaciones mas jóvenes de artistas contemporáneos en Puerto Rico. Este proyecto también propone un acercamiento al trabajo de Viveca Vázquez desde una perspectiva artística jóven contribuyendo al análisis crítico y teórico sobre el arte contemporáneo en Puerto Rico.

<h3>Why this project?</h3>
<p>I was inspired to do this show as a way of paying homage to my childhood spent on 40 acres of land in Langley.  Over the last few years, I’ve noticed that ""outdoorsy"" side of me slowly fading away.  Despite the fact that Vancouver is a natural rainforest and surrounds us with an overwhelming abundance of natural resources, at times I’ve felt like I’m being swallowed by the hustle and bustle of city life.  The need to work multiple jobs to support myself as a budding artist disconnects me - and I know many others - from the natural world and elements that surround us all the time (as we struggle to make ends meet in one of the most expensive cities in the world).  It’s a sad and strange paradox, not all encompassing, but a true reflection on my life and on the lives of others I know, with an acknowledgement of where I’ve come from and where I'm at now.</p>
<p>As a graduate of UBC's BA Honours program, I was also looking to challenge myself by truly spearheading a project, rather than just being the second string.  My passion for collective creation and on-site productions stems from the diverse challenges and happy accidents that present themself under atypical circumstances, influencing our creation in ways we may never think of in that conventional black-box theatre space.</p>
<h3>The ""Fringe"" Onsite Challenge</h3>
<p>No, it is never easy to independently produce any type of theatre production, but it IS particularly challenging when the cost attached to getting involved with the festival exceeds the actual amount that one may make back.  My passion for this project has led me to take the risk of simply, losing money.  According to my budget, even taking into consideration ""in kind"" donations from friends and family, the cost of the show simply exceeds the revenues, by approximately $1650.  This is factoring in the time and effort that is put in by the actors, the crew, my production team, and everything else that goes into putting on the show, like costumes, props etc.</p>
<p><strong>THE CATCH</strong> :  We only have one audience member per show.  The show is meant to be experienced in a one-to-one framework with one audience member being guided through the play with the lead actress.  So in theory, there is only potential to sell one ticket per show:  Which means we have...</p>
<p>42 shows at $10 per show</p>
<p>28 shows at $12 per show</p>
<p>Budgeting our projections at 30% audience capacity = $226.80 from ticket sales</p>
<p>Even at full audience capacity, that only = $756 and it costs...drumroll please...</p>
<h3><strong>$800 for the Onsite Venue alone!</strong></h3>
<h3>So, unfortunately, we can't even really break even without help from friends outside of ticket sales. :(  </h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Anything and everything you would like to send our way.  And I know everyone says this, but, every little bit really DOES HELP!</p>
<p>If you're not able to make a monetary contribution, there are many other ways that you can contribute.  Should you want to make an in-kind donation to the production you can e-mail me directly at <a href=""mailto:jessica-nelson@live.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jessica-nelson@live.ca </a></p>
<p>Items that would be useful for the show! </p>
<p>1. Outdoor battery powered lanterns!  This is our way of lighting the show, and it might seem like at this point in time it stays light out longer, by September, the sun will be setting by 8:00pm, so lighting will be key!!! (cost of batteries and lanterns each can add up, my friends!)</p>
<p>2. If you are affiliated with some sort of printing company and would like to donate or sponsor the show with posters and postcards to advertise, that would also be incredible!</p>
<p>3. If you have read about the show from the above campaign and would like to share information about us on social media to help us get an audience that too would be amazing!!!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our artistic economy is in dire straights at the moment.  With continuous funding cuts and lack of support from provincial and federal artistic governing bodies, theatre suffers across the board.  As it is, the majority of funding still goes to union-affliiated theatre houses that have been staples in the Vancouver scene for a long time.  Supporting the Fringe Festival, and in turn supporting artists who participate in this festival, gives new artists an opportunity to take risks and contribute to the theatre canon in ways that are less affected by the need to do a show that will ""have an audience"".  This is not to say that the audience is invalid, but more a point in support of taking chances in order to further the artistic make-up and craft of theatre.  It gives us an outlet to really explore pressing issues that are affecting us NOW!  It also gives us an opportunity to push the envelope and explore new ways for theatre to plant roots in our current arts environment.</p>
<h3>Why Theatre?</h3>
<p>There is a romance about theatre.  That romance is in its fleeting nature.  No matter what, no show is ever like the last.  Something that happens at one show, may not happen at another.  This is even more of a possibility when one is doing an on-site show, with the environment also playing a character in the piece.  Also, no matter what you do, there is no way to accurately document a live performance.  Never.  No one has ever managed, and no one ever will, because there is a genuine exchange of energy that takes place between audience and performer that can not be replicated.  And in particular with this show, the exchange, will inevitably be even more intimate when one person's energy and participation with the actors, will inform the style, mood, and energy of the piece.  THAT'S exciting!  Don't you think?  The ephemerality is priceless! </p>
<p><br/>As a final note:</p>
<h2>THANK YOU!!!!!</h2>
<p>So much!  For taking the time to read about our show!  For spreading the word!  For any and all support that you're able to give in any way shape or form!  And for supporting the arts and seeing the value in it for our world today! </p>

Our Story
An
innovative performance: 

spoken word fused with enchanting experimental
music, contemporary dance and mesmerizing visuals.

      Lovers Walk - A Poetic Journey in Eight Scenes, a short (yet infinite) odyssey created by dancer Siri Embla and poet Gus Simonovic, with video material by visual artist Peter Brierley-Millman and music by Jo Blankenburg ( piano ), Gareth Priceless ( guitar ), Dubtext ( all things electronica ) and Kotaro Nishishita (classical guitar ).""Aroha, acquaintance, romance, affection, devotion, liaison - the show is about love in all its forms. “Lovers Walk reshapes shapes and brighten colours in your love-kaleidoscope while telling you a story that you know so well, as it was your own,”

 ... created to be a feast for all senses .. rich in content and extravagant  ... 
and now, compacted to be portable/ tour-able/perform-able in small spaces ...                                  performed LIVE by Gus and Siri .. but 
 WITHOUT A PROJECTOR THERE IS NO SHOW!!! We've been blessed with borrowing a projector for our shows in New Zealand...  Now we are travelling overseas, Fringe Festival in Edinburgh and other spots in Europe we must take one with us.

<h3>What are you crazy kids up to?</h3>
<p>We're a dedicated group of actors who will perform 12 shows of Adam Bock's ""The Drunken City"" in late November - early December. We've hired a director, assembled a stellar team of designers, and rented a theater.</p>
<p>Now, all we need is a little cash to get us on stage!!</p>
<p>Samantha Payne Garland, the lead producer, self-produced a play early in 2011, and it was a huge success. This is her newest effort, a great big ambitious goal to produce and co-star in a play in a 65-seat theater, with a real design team supporting the players. She is joined by David Marshall, Jen Ponton, Kelly Strandemo, and Tyrone Davis, Jr. and Nicholas Cocchetto. We will be directed by Misti Wills.</p>
We'll be performing at the Workshop Theater Main Stage in midtown Manhattan. It's a 65-seat, plushly outfitted theater.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>(Full production details listed below)</em></div>
<div>
<h3>What will you do with all this money?</h3>
<p>We are fundraising for the very basic costs of space and the rights to perform the play. Theater rentals and rehearsal space are exorbitantly expensive in this little town of NYC.</p>
<p>Theater rental:            $8,100</p>
<p>Rehearsal space:         $2,500                                                               </p>
<p>Licensing play rights:    $   900                                                          </p>
<p>Insurance:                  $   550</p>
<p>                                 ________</p>
<p>                                 $ 12,050</p>
<p><br/>Most of our designers are pitching in out of passion for the project. But we still want to honor their designs and give them the tools to build the sets, hang the lights, design the sound, and choreograph the heck out of this amazing play.</p>
<p>For this, we will sell tickets to cover the costs.</p>
<p>OR - if we do really well and raise the minimum $13,000 here, then we will spend that money on sets and costumes and lights!! Can you imagine?!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why this play now?</h3>
<p>This play examines what's hard and what's wonderful about friendships and about love. A bride out on the town for her bachelorette party starts to question the decision she has made... and it ripples through her friendships. ""The Drunken City"" explores the ways in which our intimate relationships are tied to our peer groups, and how hard it can be to break out of those. And it explores the myriad ways in which we run from love, how being afraid of what's hard keeps us from opening up to what's right in front of us.</p>
<p>""The Drunken City"" offers a timely exploration of the relationships that shape us, and the ways we struggle to remain true to ourselves within or in spite of those relationships.</p>

<p>areadance is a co-operated company in the process of expanding it's artistic scope through collaboration, and an eager openness. Drawn to vulnerability and risk, the work allows each performance to exist as a fleeting moment. We view new inspirations as opportunities to explore boundaries and see potential in space, time, and intention. Movement shares many commonalities, but the breadth of the work is within the through-line that allows movement to become meaning, to become a statement.</p>
<p>As a young company, we've been relishing in the journey and soaking up the creative juices of our 2011 season. Now, after a year of learning, experiencing, and growing, we are so grateful to see our work culminate for an evening in NYC. On November 2nd &amp; 3rd areadance will fill the air of Dixon Place Theater, coloring the walls with memories, dreams, and a deeply rooted soul. Our work, envisioned by two artistic directors, is richly painted by humanity and ingenuity with a physicality tapering on the edge of falling. We care less about the final product, than we do the development of that project; a trait which gives us the power for progressive artistry. Movement is a universal language, which has the potential to speak volumes and generate conversation.</p>
<p><br/>By donating to our campaign, you will bring areadance's vision to life. Contributing towards our efforts makes you a member of the areadance family, having a firsthand opportunity to access our work and share personal insight.</p>

<p><strong>Our Embodied Impulses </strong></p>
<p>…is a dance project for 10 dance artists to join in creating a performance using movement scores that encourage dancers to engage in a grounding and introspective process. The movement scores that shape this project will cultivate a meditative and reflective embodied practice, accompanied by journaling and guided by our physical and emotional impulses. The dancers complete the movement scores in their own private space, then later come together as a group to exchange findings and explore them collectively.  Ultimately, we will create dances together out of the material that surfaces. </p>
<p>During a time when stress, loss, uncertainty and isolation have been abundant, it feels essential to make time for ourselves to check-in, acknowledge, and release whatever it is we’re holding from the day(s).  The movement scores offered through Our Embodied Impulses will prompt dancers to bring attention to physical and emotional impulses, to move with them, and to create short dances from our personal and embodied narratives. We will identify themes and retell our discussions symbolically via movement.</p>
<p>Our Embodied Impulses has been carefully crafted to provide a nurturing environment for its collaborators and invites cathartic release. By tuning in to our senses, we gather the body’s knowledge and let it guide us through processes of insight and self-expression. In addition to making dances, this is a space for us to be together, move together, and share experiences while exercising our ability as creatives to transform and regenerate our realities into something bigger. We’ll use our dances to move through and release burdens and baggages, to celebrate accomplishments, and to honor ourselves and each other.  We will allow our stories to lead us in creating something new that represents our experiences individually and collectively.   </p>
<p><strong>Our Embodied Impulses: Origin and transformation</strong></p>
<p> Our Embodied Impulses was created in response to the “lockdowns” put into effect by the coronavirus outbreak.  Originally named, “Hey Homebody” the project aimed to acknowledge the widespread and largescale stressors that many folx were met with - especially related to being isolated at home, and considering the many different scenarios that could make home feel unwelcoming, unsafe, or uncomfortable.  Interested in the question, “how do you find home in your body?”, the movement scores asked dancers to bring attention to their thoughts and their senses, and to let the body speak its peace accompanied by some journal prompts and reflections.  Through virtual rehearsals, collaborators and I came up with an under five-minute piece that represented our reflections and group discussions about the state of the world and our own states of mind during civil unrest, pandemic, and other personal challenges and joys we had met during the summer months.  We really utilized this process as a way to connect and reflect on where we were mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and to identify or explore what we needed together in this creative space.  I'm very much looking forward to sharing this experience with a larger group of movers and dance-makers, this time with a new name, and with more time to indulge in process to tell our stories. </p>
<p><strong>Your donations will...</strong></p>
<p>…give you access to snippets of our movement scores which include grounding and body centering tips, self-reflection journal prompts, and related movement exercises for you to explore on your own. </p>
<p>…compensate 10 dancers/collaborators for dedicating their artistry, bodies, time, and talents to our weekly rehearsals. Each dancer will be compensated $18/hr. </p>
<p>…make ways for us to fully engage in process by helping us reach our goal of (16) 2-hour rehearsals. In this time, we will complete two movement scores, unpack themes, and piece together movement that represents the meaning we uncover.  </p>
<p>…create a movement piece for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p>
<p>I look forward to sharing our process and outcomes with you.  I hope that you will join us by starting your own in-home self-reflective movement practice.  I also invite you to be a part of viewing and sharing feedback at the culminating premier of Our Embodied Impulses.</p>

Her works have been widely toured around the South East, and include '<em>FAWN</em>', '<em>Memento</em>', '<em>Slowly We Collide</em>' and '<em>And They Have Escaped</em>'. Her last works for A D Dance Company were '<em>Slowly We Collide</em>' and '<em>And They Have Escaped</em>' which were performed at the Yard Theatre in Hackney Wick in July 2012. <br/><br/>Holly is also actively involved in youth dance: she's the Artistic Director of <strong>English National Ballet</strong>'s youth company, <strong>ENB YouthCo</strong>, she's a regular guest teacher at <strong>Tring Park School</strong> and has worked on numerous youth dance projects and performances as well as delivering workshops throughout the UK and mentoring young dancers and choreographers.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>A D Dance Company Showcase</strong></p>
<p>We want to follow up our Glastonbury performance with a showcase of A D Dance Company pieces in London in July, in response to demand for our works, and also to stimulate interest in a nationwide tour which we are in the process of confirming. Not only will these performances provide us with the opportunity to reconnect with our London audience, but they will enable us to invite key VIPs to see our work and meet with us afterwards.</p>
<p>We are planning two performances at an intimate venue, already associated with contemporary ballet, which will be an ideal setting for attracting new audiences to our work. We feel that it would be in the company's interest to hold two performances rather than one, partly due to the size of the venue and also to accomodate those who would not be able to come if it was only on one date.</p>
<p>These performances are essential to our work because of Holly's belief in helping talented dancers reach their full potential and creating performance opportunities for them to gain more exposure and recognition.</p>
<p>The venue will offer us a box office split which will cover some of the costs of the showcase, but we need your help in ensuring our dancers get paid for their brilliant performances on both nights.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Youth Workshops</strong><br/><br/>Holly is also planning to offer a series of youth dance workshops in Brixton over the summer, specifically to reach young people with limited or no previous experience of dance. The workshops will be designed to teach basic movement sequences and improvisation, while developing sequences which can be performed at the end of the workshops. <br/><br/>The workshops will be taught by Holly and a guest teacher on alternate days so that the students can benefit from different approaches and styles.

<h3>What are You Doing Here?</h3>
<p>Our current show, <em>What are You Doing Here?, </em>has been in the works since we first came together in November 2011. After one year of devising, improvising, writing and rewriting it is coming to fruition. Now we need your help to see it through! It's part improvised, part scripted, and all site-specific at the Democracy Center in Cambridge, MA. </p>
<h3>Who is Project: Project</h3>
<p>Project: Project is a troupe producing ensemble-created, original stories that combine scripted material with improvisation, in site-specific, non-traditional spaces. Preferring creating to interpreting, we explore and experiment with form, story telling, and the role of the audience.</p>
<p>WE KNOW BOSTON NEEDS THEATRE LIKE THIS! So we're forging our own production, model, and theatre ensemble dedicated to this kind of creative process.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>YOUR DONATION MEANS YOU SUPPORT NEW, NON-TRADITIONAL, AND ENSEMBLE BASED THEATRE...</p>
<p>but like any production, we need some start up cash to get the ball rolling, and hopefully keep it rolling. Your contribution will assist with long term items such as:</p>

<li>A means of props and costume storage</li>
<li>Validation in our existance as artists.</li>

<li>A Dinner for you and a Friend made with secret recipies from Project: Project core members. (They will have dinner with you too!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Look, we're artists....</h3>
<p>and we know that what the world needs now is more art. Our formation is a testament to that, and we hope that by working together we can create something bigger than ourselves.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're a diverse group of LA-based theatre artists, with backgrounds in everything from the cutting edge works of Sacred Fools, to the Shakespeare and Americana of Theatricum Botanicum, to indie film, the Hollywood Fringe, and burlesque.</li>
<li>Like many of you, we are continually shaken by the dangers of our current political climate and president. This unorthodox, yet powerfully poignant cabaret is our way of giving voice and action to our concerns and frustration, and inspiring others to do the same. We hope you'll join us.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to stipend/reimburse all of our artists, cover the expenses of publicizing for Fringe, and allow the Cabaret to reach as many audience members as possible, we are setting a goal to raise $7000.</li>
<li>Your contribution and interest in our show, no matter how big or small, won't go unrewarded. We are offering a wide variety of amazing perks: personalized Trump-style Twitter rants, signed posters from the cast, an Orange-Mango original skit, and even one-of-a-kind artwork made just for you by Playwright/Producer Teresa Beardsley.</li>
<li><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Every donation helps. Even if our goal </span>isn't<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>reached, what we do receive will all go to the amazing artists donating their time and talent to the Cabaret.</font></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since its conception, theatre has been an integral part of political discourse and resistance. We are believers is the dogma that art can truly bring about the change we wish to see in the world, with its power, as Homer once said, ""to teach and to please."" </li>
<li>Given our current political situation, it is more imperative now to tap into the political power of theatre than at any other point in recent history. Your contributions will guarantee that our production has all of the tools at its disposal to make a powerful, meaningful statement that serves as a call to action. </li>
<li>As veterans of Fringe and a slew of successful productions around Los Angeles, we have the experience to guarantee your support will have the greatest amount of impact possible, and not go unrewarded or unappreciated.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><ul>
<li>As artists ourselves, we know that sometimes making a monetary donation can be challenging. If you are unable to contribute in this way, but still wish to support the Cabaret and what it stands, fear not! There are many other ways to help contribute to the cause!</li>
<li>Come to our show at The Hollywood Fringe! Donations are wonderful, but what our production truly needs is an audience to share its story with. Check us out and purchase tickets on our Fringe Website: <a href=""http://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/4388"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/4388</a>

Like many of you, we are continually shaken by the dangers of our current political climate and president. This unorthodox, yet powerfully poignant cabaret is our way of giving voice and action to our concerns and frustration, and inspiring others to do the same. We hope you'll join us.


What We Need & What You Get

In order to stipend/reimburse all of our artists, cover the expenses of publicizing for Fringe, and allow the Cabaret to reach as many audience members as possible, we are setting a goal to raise $7000.
Your contribution and interest in our show, no matter how big or small, won't go unrewarded. We are offering a wide variety of amazing perks: personalized Trump-style Twitter rants, signed posters from the cast, an Orange-Mango original skit, and even one-of-a-kind artwork made just for you by Playwright/Producer Teresa Beardsley.
Every donation helps. Even if our goal isn't reached, what we do receive will all go to the amazing artists donating their time and talent to the Cabaret.


The Impact

Since its conception, theatre has been an integral part of political discourse and resistance. We are believers is the dogma that art can truly bring about the change we wish to see in the world, with its power, as Homer once said, ""to teach and to please."" 
Given our current political situation, it is more imperative now to tap into the political power of theatre than at any other point in recent history. Your contributions will guarantee that our production has all of the tools at its disposal to make a powerful, meaningful statement that serves as a call to action. 
As veterans of Fringe and a slew of successful productions around Los Angeles, we have the experience to guarantee your support will have the greatest amount of impact possible, and not go unrewarded or unappreciated.

Other Ways You Can Help
As artists ourselves, we know that sometimes making a monetary donation can be challenging. If you are unable to contribute in this way, but still wish to support the Cabaret and what it stands, fear not! There are many other ways to help contribute to the cause!
Come to our show at The Hollywood Fringe! Donations are wonderful, but what our production truly needs is an audience to share its story with. Check us out and purchase tickets on our Fringe Website: http://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/4388

Follow us on social networking! Find us on Facebook (@OrangeMangoCabaret), Twitter (@CabaretMango), and Instagram (@themangoinchief). Share our updates and posts, and help us spread the word! Feel free to share this Indiegogo page as well!

<p>I have started Irish
Dancing in 2008 with the certainty that this was what I had to do in my life. I’ve
started off with a few workshops, as at that time there were no regular classes
in Romania, so in between occasional workshops, I would spend 3 to 6 hours a day practicing every day. <br/></p><p>After finishing up my University studies (which included
general teaching techniques), I’ve decided it was time I made regular Irish
dance classes a permanent thing, so I gave up my “normal” job, my Master’s
degree and my financial stability and set-up a proper school which addresses
kids and adults all together. <b>My main goal is to make Irish
dancing in Romania the popular sport it is abroad and one major contribution to this is my achieving of the TCRG certificate. </b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/336380/files/20140129042938-1782161_10202309242106084_2074095378_n_-_Copy.jpg?1390998578"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What do I need help for and how will I acknowledge your support ?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Because Irish dancing
is a new sport in Romania, it needs all the local involvement it can get in
order to be visible and available for an increasing number of people. This
means that all the spare time I can get and almost all the financial resources
I have I invest in it. </p>
<p>With five to six days
of weekly dance classes, plus all the extra hours needed to promote it, manage
the performance group, the accounting part, website and social network
managing, choreographing, practicing, studying and so on, I would not have the
time for an extra job. I would never complain about it, as it is a very
rewarding life-style, but my personal means of raising the money for the exam
fee and associated expenses have already made me postpone it three times
already.</p>
<p><b>The exam fee is 600 EUR
and I will have to travel to Limerick/Ireland and stay there for a few days, as
long as the exam lasts. It all sums up to 900 EUR (this including exam fee, travelling costs and accommodation). </b></p>
<p>With much gratitude for those who will support
me in my dream, <b><i>I will send out a personalised post card from Ireland</i></b>, so please send me
your address.<b><i> I will also make a list of all the supporters on <a href=""http://www.steysha-dansirlandez.ro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the school’s website</a></i></b>, so please let me know if you wish to be
listed and give me your full name.</p>
<br/><h3>More about me and the exam<br/>
</h3><p><b></b></p>
<p>After my beginners years, I have associated with my current TCRG (also the first and only native Polish TCRG),
who is mentoring me for the certification exam and so, my dancers were able to
start competing. Between 2012-2013, within 3 feiseanna, I had 21 dancers
entered (ages 6-42) who brought home a total of 149 awards (13 firsts and a
great number of seconds and thirds) and their tendency of getting more medals,
being better awarded and granted more and more placements in the next levels of
difficulty are part of what makes it all worth the love and effort I put in teaching
all of them. </p>
<p>I have as well been in
several feiseanna (beginner to Open Championships), but I have decided that being there for their competitions
and moments of success was more important, so my focus has naturally shifted.<b>
My ultimate goal, the TCRG examination, is more important for my dancers, the
school and myself. Succeeding in this would bring much more delight and opportunities
for all of us, both nationaly, as well as internationally.</b></p>
<p><b>What
is this exam?</b></p>
<p>The TCRG examination is
one of the biggest challenges of an Irish dancer choosing to become a teacher. It
is a multi-section official examination which the dancer has to pass in front
of a Commission and succeeding in it grants you the diploma and international
status of official Irish Dancing teacher. </p>
<p>It consists of five
sections and the preparation for each of them requires a lot of time, energy and
dedication (which often equals to days of just living and breathing Irish dance
– dance classes, personal practice, learning the traditional, modern and social dances,
choreographing and so on). </p>
<p><u>The exam sections</u>: <br/></p><p>1) practical test in dancing <span><br/></span></p><p><span>2) written ceili dancing test

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Harold and the Purple Crayon is the story of a boy with a magical purple crayon that makes everything he draws come to life. It is inherently about creating something out of nothing. To highlight this, we use a company of six performers: one to play Harold and the rest to collectively portray the crayon and create the structure of Harold’s worlds using their bodies.</p>
<p>Overall, this adaptation of Harold and the Purple Crayon tells the tale of a boy who leaves home only to discover, using the assistance of a little magic, that he needs to return. The piece’s whimsical exploration of themes such as rebuilding and the importance of community will allow spectators of all generations to follow both their imaginations and their hearts.</p>
<p>We began the creation and devising process in September 2017, and have since grown it into a full scale production that we are excited about sharing with as many kids as possible. </p>

Christopher K. Morgan & Artists is the newest company to hit the Washington, DC dance scene and is the resident dance company of CityDance.  
November 18-20, the company will present Reveal, an evening of dance to celebrate the opening of the CityDance Studio Theater at Strathmore. But BEFORE we can hit the stage we need your help, to make sure we can get DRESSED!
Currently almost all the funds available to the company are going to artist fees.  But we all know it takes more than just performers to stage a dance concert.  Please don't let us dance naked! And while we are at it, we'll not only make sure the dancers have clothes, but we are making custom designed jackets for the panels that will serve as the projection surfaces for the newest work on the program, In Plain Sight.  The fabric for these panels has already cost $400, the labor is estimated to be $300. Your contribution directly underwrites these and other costs.
In Plain Sight is a world premiere collaboration between Choreographer & Artistic Director Christopher K. Morgan, Composer Ignacio Alcover (Morgan's longtime collaborator from Musica Aperta), Photographer Kay Chernush (whose series of photographs on human trafficking inspire the work) and Projection Designer/Dance Technologist Shannon Braine.

Also on the program, Morgan will perform a world premiere solo (that still needs a costume!) with an orginal score he created with New York based composer Monstah Black, a reprise of the exuberant work Tarantella, and a special performance by students of the CityDance Conservatory in Morgan's 2002 work Ties That Bind (we made sure the students have costumes already!).
Check out the website for more information on the company and upcoming performances.




The Impact
Christopher K. Morgan & Artists recognizes that in order to do their best work dancers need to be clothed and warm. You can help us do that by making sure they do not go onstage naked! Reveal will truly be a special evening of performance, with wonderful collaborations and work that connects current cutting edge artists with the next generation of performers.  Your contributions are an important part of the perpetuation of this vitally important art form.

What We Need & What You Get

We are seeking to raise $1500 to finish costuming this production, both the dancers and the set!

No matter how much money we raise the show will go on... but this campaign determines what we will be wearing!

<p><b><i>VIRGINS DIE HORNY </i></b>is the provocative, funny, and
terrifying story of Katie, a 38-year old woman, who has married for
the third time in ten years. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The play opens on Katie’s
honeymoon night with James and takes the audience on a cocaine-fuelled,
alcohol-drenched roller coaster ride through the tangled relationships
tenuously held by Katie and her three husbands, past and present – Jamie,
Jimmy, and now James. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As the play unfolds, Jimmy, Katie’s second husband
crashes the honeymoon, drunk and suicidal. Jimmy, holds Katie and her new
husband, James, hostage  threatening to detonate the dynamite sown into the
orange life jacket he is wearing under his coat. Meanwhile, Jimmy has
secretly arranged for Jamie, Katie’s first husband to join them as well. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So by the end of the first act, poor Katie finds
herself held hostage with all three of her husbands – on her honeymoon! </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The second act is a terrifying and sometimes funny
tour de force that builds to the reluctant disclosure of a carefully kept and
devastating secret that all three husbands have agreed to keep from Katie.
Events late in the second act, dictate that this secret must be told, regardless
of the chilling consequences … consequences unlike any that you may have seen
before on the London stage.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Katie is a woman who at times feels  she is defined
by the men she marries. And the husbands feel that they are meant to care and
protect Katie … firmly believing that they know what’s best for her. So, the
play is about love, loneliness, protecting what you value, and holding onto
secrets. The title itself refers to a decision that we are all faced with, a
question that each of us needs to answer in some aspects of our lives … one way or
another. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The question is this: Whether you are willing to
risk pain, loss, and experience of venturing outside yourself to joint others

valuing safety over the expense of experience.</p>

Who are We? 

We are are group of passionate dancers dedicated to unearthing the expressive power of dance! The brainchild of Dawn Mazzola and Catherine Natter, PhysiKal Bodies works to bring to light dance's ability to not only delve into emotion, but the psychological and philosophical musings of the mind.

This performance will premiere in September as a part of the Philadelphia Live Arts/Fringe Festival.

Jenny Larsson, a Swedish choreographer working in South Florida. My newest
project, called <i>The Forest Diaries</i>,
will take place in both Sweden and America, and deal with some of the themes
I've been working on for a long time: roots, ancestry, and identity. </p>
<p>The
aim behind the project is to investigate and explore my relationship with the
deep forests of Sweden (the inner calm, the scenic and beautiful sites, but
also the mystical and sometimes scary forests I’m afraid to enter). My intention is to channel all of these sensations through my dancing.</p>
<p> Throughout all of July, I'll be selecting 30
sites in the forests of my homeland, one for each day of the month. There, in
each spot, I will create a site specific dance piece. I will be collaborating
with musical composer Dag Rosenqvist, which will be writing original music for
each piece. I will also be collaborating with Bjornhult Media, who will be
filming the pieces.  </p>
<p>The
final product will be three-fold. First, I will create a 30 minute-long dance
film with photographer and video artist, Edison Penafiel . The film will be screened, alongside a
multimedia presentation at Girls' Club, an alternative contemporary art space in
Ft Lauderdale, followed by a live performance at the Vanguard Theater,
also in Ft. Lauderdale. </p>
<p>To
do all of this, we need your support. Every little bit helps -- a five dollar
donation can make a big difference in the long run! For me, it's very important
to pay artists for their hard work and your donations will help make that
happen. The money will pay for technicians and materials.Thank you for listening and watching this video. We really appreciate
you, and are excited to begin working on this project!</p><br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need </h3><p></p><table><tbody>

Haché pourront travailler ensemble pour transporter le public dans son propre monde, trop souvent ignoré.Le pourquoiFaire du théâtre n'est pas chose simple, et souvent l'obstacle de l'argent est le premier qui se pose dans le chemin. Le Théâtre La Cigogne essaie donc avec cette campagne de financement de ramasser les fonds de base pour payer l'auteur et le concepteur musical. Vos dons participeront donc directement à la création du spectacle. Votre participation nous est absolument indispensable! C'est pourquoi n'importe quel don est incroyablement apprécié et certaines récompenses seront remises!

<p>We are an ensemble of 8 international actors finishing their last semester of our MFA program at Brooklyn College and we're looking for backers to help fund our Spring showcase!</p>
<p>Our ensemble consists of artists from Zambia, Puerto Rico, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, India, and various regions of the United States: a microcosm of the world and a reflection of our home for the last two years, Flatbush, Brooklyn. Our class is uniquely suited to meet the needs of an industry that craves and desperately needs diversity in representation to tell the stories that need to be told in 2018 and beyond.</p>
<p>For the first time, the Brooklyn College MFA Acting class will be conducting an innovative, two-pronged approach to our showcase: we will be creating an online video series of professionally produced scenes highlighting our diverse talents and personalities, as well as an onstage performance for industry professionals alongside the Brooklyn College BFA class on April 1, 2019 at the Clurman Theater in Theatre Row. Together, these two showcases will serve as our official introduction to the professional film, TV, and theatre world as well as the culmination of two years of rigorous study and practice.</p>
<p>We have so far raised $1000 of our $5000 goal. However, we need $2300 ASAP in order to pay for our online showcase. <strong>Hence, your generous contributions towards Phase I of our fundraising efforts will be geared towards paying the production company that will be handling our online reel</strong>. We will launch Phase II in February to fund theater rental for our live showcase, brochure printing, catering, and marketing costs. Any leftover funds will be given as a gift towards next year's MFA Acting showcase.</p>
<p>Any and all contributions are welcome and helpful. If you can't give, don't fret! Please help us out by sharing this campaign on social media and spread the word!</p>

<p>The Penguin Project is a unique theatre experience dedicated to children with developmental disabilities.

<p>Our mission is to bring out these hidden abilities in a safe and supporting environment. For many of these children, it is the first time they are able to connect or bond with people of their age.

By performing in fantastic shows every year, children with disabilities gain self-confidence and learn communication skills essential for when they leave the comfort of the program.</p>
<p>The Penguin Project also includes a summer camp immersion experience to continue the project year round. We have also created a troupe for older Penguins who have graduated from the program to continue their opportunities to perform and maintain social connections.</p>

After producing my last creation Fragmented Mind in spring 2016 with great feedback from audiences, I was inspired to pursue my own creative channels. Having danced the last year with  Ballet Jazz, I am inspirited with new ideas and here comes the moment. My dream is coming true. I am back choreographing and presenting full evening show.</p><p>This creation is very special for me, mostly because of its main topic, which is addiction. Addiction to blue.</p><p><i><strong>Blue Dependence</strong></i></p><p><i>We all dance throughout our days, years and entire lives. <br/>We play, we work, we reach upwards, but we always fall to the level of our habits.<br/>If this dance we call life, was a show, it would be called <br/>""Blue Dependence"". <br/>And if our heroine had a name, it would be Iris.</i></p><p><i>Iris named after the Greek goddess, who was the link between the divine and humanity. <br/>Goddess of the high skies and low rocky ocean, Iris was a messenger of the gods; a flower shifting from blue to violet; a set of eyes between two worlds.</i></p><p><i>Our pupils dilate when we see something we desire - expanding into our irises like ink dropped into a drink. All the iris can do is support this cycle, holding each pupil under tension; cradling them as they grow and collapse over and over.</i></p><p><i>Our eyes do this dance and we can see a pattern emerging: a pattern of desire, release and craving... a pattern of addiction, and the iris is witness to it all.</i></p><p><i>I am telling the story of our human Iris and her struggle with dependence. <br/>This is her struggle and ours. <br/>We cannot move forward until we conquer what holds us back. <br/>In the end, it is ourselves.</i></p><p><i>Once we realize this, we can awaken our spirit and set it free!</i></p><p><u><strong>ABOUT THE TEAM</strong></u></p><p><strong>Choreographer, <a href=""http://www.evakolarova.com/dance-me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eva Kolarova</a></strong></p><p>Eva was born in Czech Republic. She studied at the National Dance Conservatory in Prague, then Rudra Béjart Ballet School in Lausanne and the Hoschule für Kunst und Musik in Munich. In 2008, she joined the Ballet de l'Opéra National du Rhin, in France. In spring 2011, she joined Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal and in June 2016 she joined Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal.</p><p>A native of the Czech Republic, a professional dancer, and for several years now, a choreographer living and based in Montreal, I have always felt the need to find my own way, my own “steps”, and to invent my own choreographic language.</p><p>I started dancing at the age of 5 and won my first choreographic prize at the age of 13.                    </p><p>In pursuit of this dream, I recently decided to leave Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal, and took the risk of becoming a free-lance dancer and choreographer full time. </p><p>My goal is to make and produce my own work and found a dance company here in Montreal.</p><p><strong>Assistant of the choreographer, <a href=""http://www.kyrajeangreen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kyra Jean Green</a></strong></p><p><strong>Dancers, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sara.harton.5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sara Harton</a>, Eva Kolarova, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=521495018"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">José Flores</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/francois.richard.393?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Francois Richard</a></strong></p><p><strong>Concept for Video Projection and photo material, <a href=""http://www.runningleappictures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paolo Santos</a></strong></p><p><strong>Music composer, <a href=""https://vieuxneant.bandcamp.com/album/vieux-neant"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charles Bicari</a></strong></p><p><strong>Lighting Designer and Technical Director, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pierre.lavoie.77?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pierre Lavoie</a></strong></p><p><strong>Digital promotion/marketing communications, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/legatomtl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ryan MacDowell</a> </strong></p><p><strong>Photo by <a href=""http://www.kravetzphotographics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sasha Onyshchenko</a></strong></p><p>I am very grateful to collaborate with such a wonderful artists and I believe that together we will bring an amazing performance to the stage.</p><p><strong>This is where you come in!</strong></p><p>For that dream become a big success, we need your help to meet the cost of producing such a performance.</p><p><u><strong>GOAL OF THIS CAMPAIGN - WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING? </strong></u></p><p>This campaign is important as it will help us with much needed funding to go towards expenses incurred in producing this show. </p><p>Within the team, our individual expertise and processes are diverse, and we are all bringing  something different to the framework of this performance.  </p><p>The expenses of doing so are fairly significant, and we are asking for your help so that we may be able to secure costumes, props, production elements, lighting, projection equipment,promotional materials, as well as the means to pay the crew a fair fee for their efforts in making the show possible.

</h3><p>( Na kterém tradičně spolupracuji s Actors studiem, mou mateřskou školou. )</p><p><strong>Pro ty z Vás, kteří mne neznají:</strong></p><p>Jmenuji se Eva Kolářová, jsem Češka, jsem profesionální klasická a moderní tanečnice a miluji tanec. Také již mnoho let současně s tancem, se realizuji jako choreografka.</p><p>Co je pro mne tanec?</p><p>Zatím jsem nenašla lepší definici tance, než jakou jsem si pro sebe před lety, jako velmi mladá vytvořila.</p><p>""Balanc nad propastí naší touhy po dokonalosti a kráse, kde  používáme řeč duše, beze slov... Nemůžeme tančit v minulosti ani v budoucnosti, ale tančíme vždy tady a teď, celým svým já! Neopakovatelně!“</p><p>Snad proto, již jako malá, jsem cítila touhu vytvářet své vlastní kroky, svůj vlastní taneční jazyk.

After producing my last creation Fragmented Mind in spring 2016 with great feedback from audiences, I was inspired to pursue my own creative channels. Having danced the last year with  Ballet Jazz, I am inspirited with new ideas and here comes the moment. My dream is coming true. I am back choreographing and presenting full evening show.This creation is very special for me, mostly because of its main topic, which is addiction. Addiction to blue.Blue DependenceWe all dance throughout our days, years and entire lives. We play, we work, we reach upwards, but we always fall to the level of our habits.If this dance we call life, was a show, it would be called ""Blue Dependence"". And if our heroine had a name, it would be Iris.Iris named after the Greek goddess, who was the link between the divine and humanity. Goddess of the high skies and low rocky ocean, Iris was a messenger of the gods; a flower shifting from blue to violet; a set of eyes between two worlds.Our pupils dilate when we see something we desire - expanding into our irises like ink dropped into a drink. All the iris can do is support this cycle, holding each pupil under tension; cradling them as they grow and collapse over and over.Our eyes do this dance and we can see a pattern emerging: a pattern of desire, release and craving... a pattern of addiction, and the iris is witness to it all.I am telling the story of our human Iris and her struggle with dependence. This is her struggle and ours. We cannot move forward until we conquer what holds us back. In the end, it is ourselves.Once we realize this, we can awaken our spirit and set it free!ABOUT THE TEAMChoreographer, Eva KolarovaEva was born in Czech Republic. She studied at the National Dance Conservatory in Prague, then Rudra Béjart Ballet School in Lausanne and the Hoschule für Kunst und Musik in Munich. In 2008, she joined the Ballet de l'Opéra National du Rhin, in France. In spring 2011, she joined Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal and in June 2016 she joined Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal.A native of the Czech Republic, a professional dancer, and for several years now, a choreographer living and based in Montreal, I have always felt the need to find my own way, my own “steps”, and to invent my own choreographic language.I started dancing at the age of 5 and won my first choreographic prize at the age of 13.                    In pursuit of this dream, I recently decided to leave Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal, and took the risk of becoming a free-lance dancer and choreographer full time. My goal is to make and produce my own work and found a dance company here in Montreal.Assistant of the choreographer, Kyra Jean GreenDancers, Sara Harton, Eva Kolarova, José Flores, Francois RichardConcept for Video Projection and photo material, Paolo SantosMusic composer, Charles BicariLighting Designer and Technical Director, Pierre LavoieDigital promotion/marketing communications, Ryan MacDowell Photo by Sasha OnyshchenkoI am very grateful to collaborate with such a wonderful artists and I believe that together we will bring an amazing performance to the stage.This is where you come in!For that dream become a big success, we need your help to meet the cost of producing such a performance.GOAL OF THIS CAMPAIGN - WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING? This campaign is important as it will help us with much needed funding to go towards expenses incurred in producing this show. Within the team, our individual expertise and processes are diverse, and we are all bringing  something different to the framework of this performance.  The expenses of doing so are fairly significant, and we are asking for your help so that we may be able to secure costumes, props, production elements, lighting, projection equipment,promotional materials, as well as the means to pay the crew a fair fee for their efforts in making the show possible. The amount we are asking for is $5000. This is only a small part of the whole cost of this creation, but a very significant part which will help us greatly!From the bottom of our hearts, we appreciate anything you’re willing to give, and can assure you that all proceeds will go to help make our vision possible.Also. PLEASE come join us in October 20 and 21, 2017 at Cinquième Salle, Place des Arts in Montréal and check out the fun rewards we are able to offer in exchange for your donations, including tickets to see the show.For more details check: www.evakolarova.comThank you very much for your support!________________________________________________________________Other Ways You Can HelpSHARESpreading the word is another valuable way you can help.   Share this campaign on Facebook and Twitter.

( Na kterém tradičně spolupracuji s Actors studiem, mou mateřskou školou. )Pro ty z Vás, kteří mne neznají:Jmenuji se Eva Kolářová, jsem Češka, jsem profesionální klasická a moderní tanečnice a miluji tanec. Také již mnoho let současně s tancem, se realizuji jako choreografka.Co je pro mne tanec?Zatím jsem nenašla lepší definici tance, než jakou jsem si pro sebe před lety, jako velmi mladá vytvořila.""Balanc nad propastí naší touhy po dokonalosti a kráse, kde  používáme řeč duše, beze slov... Nemůžeme tančit v minulosti ani v budoucnosti, ale tančíme vždy tady a teď, celým svým já! Neopakovatelně!“Snad proto, již jako malá, jsem cítila touhu vytvářet své vlastní kroky, svůj vlastní taneční jazyk. A tak se choreografování brzy stalo mou vášní.O mně:Po třech letech v souboru Ballet du Rhin, po čtyřech letech v souboru Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, kde jsem tančila jako demi-sólistka, a po roce v souboru  Ballets Jazz de Montréal, kdy jsem tančila v uznávaných, velkých divadlech, skoro po celém světě, jsem se rozhodla riskovat a postavit se na vlastní nohy, abych se mohla naplno věnovat choreografování a založit si svou vlastní taneční společnost.Ne jen proto, věnuji tomuto představení celý svůj čas a energii.Celkově jde již o čtvrtou mou celovečerní choreografii a druhou, jejíž premiéra bude ve významném divadle na Place des Arts v Montrealu!O mém choreografování:Jako velmi mladá,ještě během mého studia na Taneční konzervatoři v Praze,jsem již realizovala několik svých  prací pro Actors studio v různých divadlech.... Později, při mém zahraničním studiu, jsem vytvořila několik choreografií pro Gala představení TCP ve Stavovském divadle a na Nové scéně Národního divadla a spoluvytvářela celovečerní  představení „Portrét E.K.“ v divadle ABC v Praze.Dále při svém zahraničním studiu, jsem dostala možnost choreografovat v představení pořádaném školou světoznámého choreografa Maurice Béjarta pod jeho přímým vedením! Později již v angažmá, jsem tvořila zejména pro soubor Ballet du Rhin de Mulhouse, dále pro Conservatoire de Danse de St Louis ve Francii.Od mého příjezdu do Kanady jsem uvedla několik projektů, které vyvolali zájem v profesionální taneční komunitě v Montreálu.:„Metamorphosis de l’amour“ v Théâtre La Chapelle v Montreálu, složené z mých choreografií.Výňatky z kritik :Co mě nejvíce zasáhlo z celého večera byla scéna  ""Lidský hlas"", zatančená  Evou  Kolarovou samotnou…, která nás vtáhla do víru emocí beze slov a přesto naprosto výmluvných! V souhrnu: jde o velmi přitažlivé umělecké dílo, které nás vrací k tématu lásky… ( © Voir,  Robert St-Amour - 12.8.2012).  „Koloběh“ ,který byl uveden na festivalu Quartiers Danses v roce 2014„Koloběh“ od  Evy Kolářové …. je zářivou „jedna a plus“ současného moderního tance…       ( © Danscussions.com, 15.9.2014).… Evu Kolarovou, demisólistku  „Les Grands Ballet“, která se, od uvedení vlastního celovečerního představení v roce 2012, výrazně rýsuje jako nadějný choreografický talent a to jak pro abstraktní, tak i pro narativní choreografie…( © Gazette Montreal, 6.9.2014)  „Koloběh“ byl také vybrán porotou na 20. výročí dalšího významného festivalu v Montrealu „Vue sur la Relevé“ v dubnu 2015.
 „Koloběh–fáze II“ , který byl uveden v rámci projektu „Metamorphosis“ organizovaném Studiem 303 a uvedeným v prosinci 2014. 
„Rozpolcené vědomí“, mé poslední celovečerní představení, které mělo svou velmi úspěšnou premiéru v únoru 2016, v Cinquième Salle, Place des Arts. 
„Rozpolcené vědomí“, bylo vizuálně ohromující a emocionálně nabité moderní taneční představení, mladé a nesmírně talentované české choreografky Evy Kolarové, která momentálně tvoří zde v Montreálu...

</ul></div>","5th Element Center for Dance’s mission is to foster personal & artistic development through the hip hop arts for youth to grow into compassionate, knowledgeable, and expressive artists who are connected to themselves & their communities. Through a multifaceted and culturally responsive approach, we work to remove social and economic hurdles that limit access to dance, wellness, and academic opportunities for youth in Aurora, CO.We work to make spaces that prioritize equity in a field that is permeated with inequities and reflects greater systems of oppression in our society. We believe that the commercialization of dance should not make it inaccessible to the communities who founded many of the most commodified styles out of hardship, liberation, and joy. We are committed to changing the cultures and systems that keep the field of dance homogeneous. 5th Element Center of Dance seeks to build and contribute to a society in which the waves of culture and the arts uplift the expression of the most historically silenced people.Through dance instruction, self engagement, community engagement, and social emotional & relational and academic supports, we offer resources that low-income and Black and Brown students need to thrive as competitive dancers, as cultural producers, and as humans successfully navigating their own wellness. We have offered tens of virtual dance classes for students of all ages and skill levels, with no cost barrier, and we’re just getting started! Every class and service is a chance for us to provide connection and expression, as an opportunity to enrich our students’ lives.Your financial contribution will help us lay a foundation for our new organization. It will allow us to open a physical location for our students and programs and hire and train a full staff, including the dance instructors, tutors, and Dean of Students who will be critical to our support systems.We offer a variety of dance classes.

<h3>OUR BEGINNING...</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Scarlett Kim, the creator and director of THE END, THE END, THE END... Let me tell you how it all began, and how ecstatic and grateful we are to show our work on the Edinburgh stage!</p>
<p>In 2016, artists from South Korea, the Philippines, China, Puerto Rico, Chile, Alabama, Illinois, New Haven, and Georgia, MFA students at the California Institute of the Arts School of Theatre asked a question that none could answer but no one was exempt from: <strong>What is America?</strong> We proposed: perhaps it is a rehearsal room, like this one. Tyler mentioned his utopic childhood memory of watching <i>Home Alone </i>with his family on Christmas Eve in his Chicago living room. I said, well, I’ve never actually watched <i>Home Alone</i>, but when I first moved to America, I used to tell people a made-up memory of watching Home Alone with my family in front of a fireplace because it seemed like such an iconic American memory. I believed that to possess that memory would surely make me American.</p>
<p>Then and there we grasped “Americans” and “non-Americans” in the room alike had been developing a practice of imagining and remembering as a way to survive America. Since then, our tribe of outsiders-in-a-land-of-outsiders grew to include artists from Taiwan, Nigeria, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and California. We often toss around “I wouldn’t give a f*** about theatre if I didn’t have to perform every day in real life.” <strong>THE END, THE END, THE END… is a Rube Goldberg machine whose parts are our bodies, convictions, and prejudices, a culmination of our two-year experiment in performing as becoming in America.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></h3>
<p>Facing end-of-the-world paranoia in America and drowning in media, the exiles labor through the act of remembering and performing. To survive America, they must constantly revise their personal histories and ideologies as the alleged “other.” To combat entropy, to find home, to discover utopia, to believe in anything at all, the ensemble grotesquely reenacts found and real childhood memories, and channels political superpowers.</p>
<p>The blood-pumping rhythm of pop iconography intersects with intensely intimate storytelling, and cuts to operatic manifestos of political prophets, creating an explosive performance collage that defies borders, genre and time. A rich array of multimedia platforms headed by motion-sensor video and real-time light art partners the athleticism and sensuality of the performing bodies.</p>
<p>THE END, THE END, THE END… responds to the urgent identity crisis America is currently undergoing. Through their powerful polyphonic togetherness, the tribe of outsiders-in-a-land-of-outsiders debunks myths of otherness, and invites the audience to co-author the utopia machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE COMPANY &amp; OUR PRACTICE</h3>
<p><i>Our body of work is an act of survival and love, a laboratory of being, becoming and performing. We stage our funeral, wedding, birth at once in face of end-of-the-world paranoia. A simultaneous act of rehearsal and archiving, our ontologies and ideologies perpetually re-collage themselves in our ritual, as they do in our lives as exiles. Our mission of polyphony, paradox and porousness manifests formally and through our commitment to changing the world. Our practice is a platform for inquiry into our direct experience with urgent justice initiatives such as institutional oppression, censorship, immigration, post-/colonialism, and gender and racial emancipation. Growing out of grassroots and DIY origins, we conceive of our practice as labor, and urge the audience to work with us. We cast YOU as co-authors in our work as a nexus for exchange of subjectivity.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR STAKES</h3>
</div><div>
<p>THE END, THE END, THE END… has developed through a unique intersection of international artists gathered in America. Our daring take on myths of America and otherness may conflict with freedom of speech measures of some of the countries we are from. <strong>In certain cases, some combination of the perceived propaganda message and indirect speech in our work may be subject to censorship</strong>. We internationally premiere THE END… at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2017, a third space to the dichotomy of our home and our present in America.</p>
<p>By helping us get to Edinburgh, you foster our budding ensemble of two years in search of unique situations for our work that resonates with our liminality and survival stakes. <strong>You are our first producers of a collaboration we hope to grow into a lifelong ensemble and practice</strong>. We hope to continue to find contexts all over the globe and across genres to produce our work, and we can only do it if you journey with us!</p>

<h3><strong>A forest cannot grow without just the right elements coming together, and neither can we. </strong></h3>
<p>My name is Twila Jane (many of you knew me as Khalima!), and I am the the producer, choreographer,  and community mama for Eternal Forest, a fiercely gorgeous theatrical dance taking place at Dogtown Dance Theatre in September of 2017. I'm also the owner and instructor at Electric Nomad Dance (formerly Illumination Dance Studio), where an amazing group of women and men explore their strength and passion through dance. <br/><br/>We at Electric Nomad Dance studio are a group of primarily women who not only dance and create together, but who have a vision of making a positive impact on the world with our dance and art, while learning about dances of the world. In addition to weekly classes, workshops, and excellent technical training in classic and fusion forms of bellydance, we provide a space where are everyone is welcome to come as they are. All of our classes and most of our shows are sliding scale and donation based. We are the home to two companies that I am artistic director and choreographer for Laterna and Plume,  which are comprised of a diverse group of dancers who work hard, play hard, and have become a microcosm of what it means to truly work together. We live the art of symbiosis, and we would like to invite you to grow alongside us!<br/><br/>The narrative of Eternal Forest is a remedy for our times, a reminder that working together is essential to the human experience, and reflects the symbiotic relationship of nature as a metaphor for communities within the world. We feel strongly that creating this kind of art is wonderful practice for how we can navigate more compassionately in the world. Supporting community based art is supporting a more positive future for our world!<br/><br/>Thankfully, Eternal Forest is not a one-woman show; it's a uniquely multi-disciplinary work that includes diverse genders, ages, sizes, and ethnicities in its cast. It is deeply important to us that what is seen on stage is a reflection of the real world (even as fantastical as we make it at times!)<br/><br/>Check out the folks who we are working with us:<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/laternadanceco/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laterna Dance Company</a><br/><a href=""http://www.rinajna.com/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rin Ajna's Myriad Project</a><br/><a href=""http://www.dawnflores.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dawn Flores and The Forest Project </a><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/serenaspearsdance/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Serena Spears</a><br/><a href=""http://www.alyssumdances.com/contortion.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alyssum Pohl</a><br/><a href=""https://hostofsparrows.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heather Bailey of Host of Sparrows</a><br/><a href=""http://www.rvadancecollective.com/company-artists"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RVA Dance Collective</a><br/><br/>Music: original music composed for the Eternal Forest by <a href=""http://fourstringsrva.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam Birce of Four Strings</a> in collaboration with Twila Jane, and also by Rin Ajna for the Myriad Project. <br/><br/>Film Backdrops by: <a href=""http://www.patrickgregoryfilms.com/Patrick_Gregory_Films/Patrick_Gregory_Films.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patrick Gregory Films</a><br/> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So much work has already gone into this production, and we are at a crucial time: we must start sewing costumes, building sets, and getting a rental home together for our out of town guests. We cannot take any chances in getting what we need for this, as the train has left the station! Together, I know our community can raise the funds needed to make this the best and most accessible show possible. When we have these material needs met, we can focus on the art and spirit of the work, AND we will have the ability to share the show with an audience on a completely donation basis. We will be able to take excerpts of the show to schools and other events, inspiring others to look at the world around them in new ways. In exchange for your contributions, we have a huge variety of perks, from front-row seats, classes, tarot readings, seeds and bulbs that were salvaged as part of Dawn Flores' conservation efforts at the Bliley Farm, and much more. <br/><br/>This is what we need: </p>
<p><strong>Guest performer pay and lodging: $4150</strong></p>
<p>This is a minimal stipend to cover the work of professional dancers who were chosen to collaborate with us, as well as the rent for housing while they are in town the week of the show.<br/><br/>House rental for a week for performers: $700</p>
<p>Groceries: $300</p>
<p><br/>Dawn Flores: $300/ $100 for each show<br/>Host of Sparrows: $300/ $100 for each show<br/>Dana: $300/ $100 for each show<br/>Rin Ajna: $300/ $100 for each show</p>
<p>~additional stipend for each member of Myriad: $1050 total/$150 each for 7 performers<br/>Sami Te': $300/ $100 for each show<br/>Alyssum Pohl: $300/ $100 for each show <br/> </p>
<p><strong>Costumes: $2000</strong><br/>$50 set aside for 40 costume pieces. This total will be used to purchase the print-to order fabric created by Dawn Flores, manufactured through Spoonflower.com. This total does not include the cost of additional embellishments. Our goal is to use as much material from the forest as possible, and to reuse/upcycle as much as possible. These costumes will be used again and again for performances and educational experiences.</p>

<p>In joining us in funding for Eternal Forest, you are making a commitment to stand by lady artists who are active in spreading the message of diverse community and remembrance of environmental concerns.

</div><div><p>We know that creating works like Eternal Forest does work to change perspectives. After <a href=""https://vimeo.com/207897671"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oceanic, our last theatrical production</a>, the feedback was incredible. Our audience left hopeful; they felt moved, and they wanted to see the show again (and bring their friends and families!). They learned about ways that they can reduce their impact on the environment through shared materials, and saw another perspective on how we can handle social toxicity as well. We were told by the audience that the world needed more positive perspectives such as what we put forth, and a personal connection to the cultural and environmental issues that we face today. Best of all, Oceanic started a lot of conversations, and sparked people to take action in their own lives. Eternal Forest is yet another chapter in the living book of care we are writing!</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this point, our greatest challenge is financial. We have already put a huge amount of work into the production already: the cast, show, music, video, and costume designs are already rolling, but we need materials to dance forward with! If we do not meet our goal, we will improvise, but the show will go on. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While we would love it if every supporter and friend could contribute, we understand that sometimes cash is hard to come by. We understand, and hope that you would consider sharing our campaign with friends and on social media, along with a message of why you think it is important for our work to be supported. If you are able to sponsor the show in a way that is not financial, please feel free to message twilajanedance@gmail.com. <br/><br/>We love you, and can't wait to dance for you!</p>
</div></div>","A forest cannot grow without just the right elements coming together, and neither can we. 
My name is Twila Jane (many of you knew me as Khalima!), and I am the the producer, choreographer,  and community mama for Eternal Forest, a fiercely gorgeous theatrical dance taking place at Dogtown Dance Theatre in September of 2017. I'm also the owner and instructor at Electric Nomad Dance (formerly Illumination Dance Studio), where an amazing group of women and men explore their strength and passion through dance. We at Electric Nomad Dance studio are a group of primarily women who not only dance and create together, but who have a vision of making a positive impact on the world with our dance and art, while learning about dances of the world. In addition to weekly classes, workshops, and excellent technical training in classic and fusion forms of bellydance, we provide a space where are everyone is welcome to come as they are. All of our classes and most of our shows are sliding scale and donation based. We are the home to two companies that I am artistic director and choreographer for Laterna and Plume,  which are comprised of a diverse group of dancers who work hard, play hard, and have become a microcosm of what it means to truly work together. We live the art of symbiosis, and we would like to invite you to grow alongside us!The narrative of Eternal Forest is a remedy for our times, a reminder that working together is essential to the human experience, and reflects the symbiotic relationship of nature as a metaphor for communities within the world. We feel strongly that creating this kind of art is wonderful practice for how we can navigate more compassionately in the world. Supporting community based art is supporting a more positive future for our world!Thankfully, Eternal Forest is not a one-woman show; it's a uniquely multi-disciplinary work that includes diverse genders, ages, sizes, and ethnicities in its cast. It is deeply important to us that what is seen on stage is a reflection of the real world (even as fantastical as we make it at times!)Check out the folks who we are working with us:Laterna Dance CompanyRin Ajna's Myriad ProjectDawn Flores and The Forest Project Serena SpearsAlyssum PohlHeather Bailey of Host of SparrowsRVA Dance CollectiveMusic: original music composed for the Eternal Forest by Adam Birce of Four Strings in collaboration with Twila Jane, and also by Rin Ajna for the Myriad Project. Film Backdrops by: Patrick Gregory Films 

What We Need & What You Get
So much work has already gone into this production, and we are at a crucial time: we must start sewing costumes, building sets, and getting a rental home together for our out of town guests. We cannot take any chances in getting what we need for this, as the train has left the station! Together, I know our community can raise the funds needed to make this the best and most accessible show possible. When we have these material needs met, we can focus on the art and spirit of the work, AND we will have the ability to share the show with an audience on a completely donation basis. We will be able to take excerpts of the show to schools and other events, inspiring others to look at the world around them in new ways. In exchange for your contributions, we have a huge variety of perks, from front-row seats, classes, tarot readings, seeds and bulbs that were salvaged as part of Dawn Flores' conservation efforts at the Bliley Farm, and much more. This is what we need: 
Guest performer pay and lodging: $4150
This is a minimal stipend to cover the work of professional dancers who were chosen to collaborate with us, as well as the rent for housing while they are in town the week of the show.House rental for a week for performers: $700
Groceries: $300
Dawn Flores: $300/ $100 for each showHost of Sparrows: $300/ $100 for each showDana: $300/ $100 for each showRin Ajna: $300/ $100 for each show
~additional stipend for each member of Myriad: $1050 total/$150 each for 7 performersSami Te': $300/ $100 for each showAlyssum Pohl: $300/ $100 for each show  
Costumes: $2000$50 set aside for 40 costume pieces. This total will be used to purchase the print-to order fabric created by Dawn Flores, manufactured through Spoonflower.com. This total does not include the cost of additional embellishments. Our goal is to use as much material from the forest as possible, and to reuse/upcycle as much as possible. These costumes will be used again and again for performances and educational experiences.
Venue: $1500This amount covers the theatre space for three shows and rehearsals, as well as crew pay.Sets: $1000While there is a focus on reusing and recycling materials, we will still have to buy items such as paint and print-on-demand fabric. This total also includes payment for backstage dressers and makeup artists.
Printing/promotional/marketing on recycled materials: $760 This will include postcards,         posters, playbills, and large display posters for outside of Dogtown Dance Theatre.

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>In the past we have been lucky to fund and create hit shows on a shoestring budget. It was exhausting and challenging but we were exhilarated by the response and the work that has been born from that. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.redbearcompany.com/patchwork"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patchwork</a> is special. We have gained experience of work within and outside our own company and we want to give this show the support, the insight and the airtime it deserves. We believe it will reach into your heart and hold a mirror up to you and the world and, for that, we desperately want to make it!</p>

Filming for ""Sister This"" (funded by Screen Ireland),  a script inspired by HARDER FASTER MORE, has just wrapped. 
Beyond the Red Bear house, most recently, Tracy's play ""Dublin Will Show You How You"" premiered at The Abbey, Ireland's National Theatre, while Aoibhéann has just completed a five week run playing Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" at The Lyric Theatre, Belfast. We're a busy, industrious bunch!
This year we want to make PATCHWORK, written & performed by Louis Deslis and directed by Tracy Martin. We have a breathtaking team behind it to make it the show it deserves to be and we believe this story should be told.
It is important to keep challenging ourselves as a company and we want this next show to challenge us AND you. It would mean an awful lot to be able to give this production the financial support it needs to really fly. We know times are tough and anything you can contribute (no matter what size) would be hugely appreciated.
The following are some of our terrific team:

Director & Producer: Tracy Martin

Dramaturg: Lee Coffey

Movement: Kate Finegan

Voice Support & Producer: Aoibhéann McCann
 

What We Need & What You Get
€3200 would help:

Design and make an amazing set, complete with technology and 'high end' finish.
Costume Louis, an essential part of our storytelling. 
Light our set and give you an exhilarating (Yes. We promise!) theatre experience.
Give our artists a (very) nominal fee for the time they use to make the show.
Us sleep at night.


The Impact
In the past we have been lucky to fund and create hit shows on a shoestring budget. It was exhausting and challenging but we were exhilarated by the response and the work that has been born from that. 
Patchwork is special. We have gained experience of work within and outside our own company and we want to give this show the support, the insight and the airtime it deserves. We believe it will reach into your heart and hold a mirror up to you and the world and, for that, we desperately want to make it!
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute it would also be brilliant if you might share this page or spread the word any way you can. 
Thank You so much,

<div>
<div>Eine Bühnen Show welches Bauchreden (Puppenspiel) und Stand Up Comedy mit magischen Elementen (Zauberkunst) vereint. Ist nicht neu? Doch! Denn es handelt sich hierbei nicht um ein Nummernprogramm, sondern um eine Konzeptshow. Und darin liegt auch die Herausforderung.

χιούμορ και τρυφερότητα το όνειρο ενός αγοριού που γκρεμίζει τον κόσμο που του
επιβάλλεται και τον ξαναστήνει από την αρχή. Πρόκειται για ένα ταξίδι ονείρου,
για μία διαδοχή εικόνων και ιδεών, μέσα από τις οποίες το παιδί ξανασυναντάει τον

<p>Στο παραμύθι αυτό, μέσα από ένα

προσδοκιών, το παιδί πειραματίζεται με τη ζωή, κάνει λάθη, αναγνωρίζει τα
συναισθήματά του και έρχεται αντιμέτωπο με τις επιλογές του. Στην πορεία αυτής
της διαδρομής, κάπου μεταξύ ονείρου και πραγματικότητας, το παιδί θα συναντήσει
έναν κόσμο όπου αντικείμενα, άνθρωποι και ζωόμορφα πλάσματα συνομιλούν, το
έμψυχο συνυπάρχει με το άψυχο, μεγέθη και κλίμακες
ανατρέπονται, χαρακτήρες εξαφανίζονται ως «δια μαγείας», σκιές

<p>Ο έντονα χειροποίητος χαρακτήρας

ομιλητικές εικόνες, η κίνηση, η μετακίνηση, η πρωτότυπη ζωντανή μουσική που
βρίσκεται σε συνομιλία με την κλασική μουσική και συνολικότερα, η αισθητηριακή
πρόσληψη του βασικού μύθου, εμπνέουν τα παιδιά να σκέφτονται δημιουργικά και
αισιόδοξα.</p>

<p><b>Σημείωμα </b><b>default </b><b>company</b></p>
<p>«Πώς να κρυφτείς απ’ τα παιδιά, έτσι κι’ αλλιώς τα ξέρουν
όλα»</p>
<p>Όχι μόνο για τα παιδιά, το θέατρο παραμένει πάντα ένα
παιχνίδι ταυτίσεων, μεταθέσεων, παραξενίσματος και γοητείας. Για να γοητεύσουμε
το παιδικό μας κοινό δεν μας αρέσει να εμπιστευόμαστε εντυπωσιακά εφέ. Οι
παραστάσεις μας θέλουμε να έχουν χαρακτήρα χειροποίητο και να φέρουν τα παιδιά
σε επαφή με τα επιμέρους στοιχεία της θεατρικής πράξης. Επιλέγουμε να
χρησιμοποιούμε στοιχεία σωματικού θεάτρου, ακροβατικά, τρόπους από το θέατρο
σκιών, από το σύγχρονο και τον κλασικό χορό. Παράλληλα οργανώνουμε και
ορισμένες, ελάχιστες, ήσυχες σκηνές που απαιτούν λίγη παραπάνω από την προσοχή
των παιδιών. Για να κατανοήσουν ότι δεν είναι όλα εύκολα, ότι να, ο χειμώνας
μπορεί να είναι λίγο πιο μελαγχολικός από το καλοκαίρι, αλλά αυτό δεν πειράζει,
ίσως-ίσως αυτό να είναι και το κρυμμένο αίνιγμα των πραγμάτων.</p>

έμψυχο συνυπάρχει με το άψυχο, μεγέθη και κλίμακες
ανατρέπονται, χαρακτήρες εξαφανίζονται ως «δια μαγείας», σκιές
και αντικατοπτρισμοί διασταυρώνονται.
Ο έντονα χειροποίητος χαρακτήρας
της παράστασης, η αφήγηση του παραμυθιού που προκύπτει μέσα από όσο γίνεται πιο
ομιλητικές εικόνες, η κίνηση, η μετακίνηση, η πρωτότυπη ζωντανή μουσική που
βρίσκεται σε συνομιλία με την κλασική μουσική και συνολικότερα, η αισθητηριακή
πρόσληψη του βασικού μύθου, εμπνέουν τα παιδιά να σκέφτονται δημιουργικά και
αισιόδοξα.
«Το παιδί και τα μάγια» είναι ένα παραμύθι που μιλάει για
την ελευθερία στο να φανταζόμαστε.
Η μουσική και τα τραγούδια
της παράστασης κυκλοφόρησαν και διατίθενται σε CD στο φουαγέ του Θεάτρου Πόρτα,
σε συσκευασία που μπορεί να γίνει και μάσκα.

Λίγα λόγια για την default company
Η default company δημιουργήθηκε από την Ξένια Θεμελή, την Αλεξία
Μπεζίκη και την Καλλιρρόη Παπαδοπούλου. Τα μέλη της ομάδας σπούδασαν θέατρο και
χορό στη Θεσσαλονίκη, τη Βέρνη και το Λονδίνο. Η ομάδα δραστηριοποιείται από το
2003 στο χώρο του θεάτρου, του χοροθεάτρου και της σύγχρονης performance. Προηγούμενες Παραγωγές: Ιστορίες
Καιρού (2012-2013), On the Run (2009), On the Blink (2007),Almost there (2006), Forced feeding (2005), Τα γενέθλια της Ινφάντα (2003).
Σημείωμα default company
«Πώς να κρυφτείς απ’ τα παιδιά, έτσι κι’ αλλιώς τα ξέρουν
όλα»
Όχι μόνο για τα παιδιά, το θέατρο παραμένει πάντα ένα
παιχνίδι ταυτίσεων, μεταθέσεων, παραξενίσματος και γοητείας. Για να γοητεύσουμε
το παιδικό μας κοινό δεν μας αρέσει να εμπιστευόμαστε εντυπωσιακά εφέ. Οι
παραστάσεις μας θέλουμε να έχουν χαρακτήρα χειροποίητο και να φέρουν τα παιδιά
σε επαφή με τα επιμέρους στοιχεία της θεατρικής πράξης. Επιλέγουμε να
χρησιμοποιούμε στοιχεία σωματικού θεάτρου, ακροβατικά, τρόπους από το θέατρο
σκιών, από το σύγχρονο και τον κλασικό χορό. Παράλληλα οργανώνουμε και
ορισμένες, ελάχιστες, ήσυχες σκηνές που απαιτούν λίγη παραπάνω από την προσοχή
των παιδιών. Για να κατανοήσουν ότι δεν είναι όλα εύκολα, ότι να, ο χειμώνας
μπορεί να είναι λίγο πιο μελαγχολικός από το καλοκαίρι, αλλά αυτό δεν πειράζει,
ίσως-ίσως αυτό να είναι και το κρυμμένο αίνιγμα των πραγμάτων.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Blue Butterfly Productions are partnering with a team of young, talented creatives to bring the most touching and currently relevant play, <i>Precious Little Talent</i>, to the Courtyard Theatre this October!</p>
<p><i>Precious Little Talent</i> explores the plight of two young people with opposing world views, Joey and Sam, as they struggle to interact with the realities of life, love, hope and relevance in a seemingly hostile and complicated world. The play also explores the story of George, an elderly gentleman navigating his retirement years with Dementia – the insufferable disease which threatens to impact everyone he loves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534832415/h6ury1pxjyqeebubo6jn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We truly believe that this play deserves a platform and as a new and emerging team, we just need a little bit of help to get it off the ground. Dementia is a subject that is not explored enough on stage and this play directly captures the experience through the eyes of the beholder, which we believe to be a rare gift! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking to raise £3,000 to get <i>Precious Little Talent</i> to the stage! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534719160/jgvzbdahlxz4b9yw3z25.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have successfully secured the rights to put on this play in October with Ella Hickson and her team and all we need now is £500 to be able to pay for them. We are over the moon that the playwright has given us the green light to bring her writing to life and we hope that you can help us find this money to get over this small but very important hurdle. </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>We have the most incredibly talented actors on board for <i>Precious Little Talent</i>! There will be 7 weeks of rehearsal for our team followed by a three week run of the play. We are passionate about supporting our actors on their journey's - not only on a career level but also by making sure that they can afford to quite literally get to work!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our set is one of the most important and exciting elements of our production. <i>Precious Little Talent</i> is mostly set in the slightly aged apartment in New York City belonging to 'George'. We need to be able to break down the set after each performance, so we are looking to spend a good chunk of the budget on a few really important pieces of furniture that represent George and his life in this apartment living with Dementia. The armchair for the character represents a real home comfort and a place to feel safe when everything gets a little too much. Take a look at our perk 'Astor Place' if you want to get your hands on our original set design sketches! </p>

If you want to get your hands on a signed copy of our poster delivered straight to your door, please see the 'Williamsburg' perk now...</p>
<p>If we do not find the entire £3000, we will prioritise spending what we do raise on the set design. All the factors mentioned above are so important to the success of our production and we so appreciate any and all donations to help us bring this show to life! </p>

<p>We wanted to get creative with our perks and to offer you some truly personal and unique gifts completely specific to the show at this time.

<p><strong>""Amor mio""</strong></p>
<p>E’la storia di un en travestì che sta per avere il suo debutto che vi racconteremo.</p>
<p>Un camerino, un palco, un pubblico in febbrile attesa: tra poco “il travestito” di cui tutta la città parla si esibirà. Un momento di divertimento per un pubblico eterogeneo che, nonostante il vento di libertà che spira in quegli anni ’70, si diverte al doppiogiochismo dell’ambiguità.</p>
<p>Del resto tutto è ambiguo nell'Italia anni ’70, in pieno fermento multiculturale, intriso di spirito di libertà, di trasgressione, di lotte politiche, libertà nei costumi, nei colori, nelle mode.</p>
<p>E non è tutto le donne diventano protagoniste complice il movimento di liberazione delle donne.</p>
<p>Un vento di novità che soffia attraverso la musica non solo made in USA ma anche quella che accompagna lo scorrere di chi è giovane in quel crocevia della storia: Battisti, Mina, Aznavour…</p>
<p>Mentre il mondo cambia, lui “il travestito” continua a vivere il doloroso dramma dell’esclusione, lui il marginale della storia e della vita. Quel palco, l’apertura di quel sipario appaiono come la sua possibilità. L’unica, forse l’ultima. Con lui una giovane donna, una francese che è la sua forza e un’ombra la madre con un carico di insopportabile dolore.</p>
<p>Un travestito, un essere umano in perenne apprendimento esistenziale, disperato equilibrismo di cuore e sentimenti, sempre in bilico tra il rifiuto e la precaria accettazione, una ricerca disperata di radici, in un continuo doloroso chiedersi il senso di quella vita che pure deve vivere, giorno dopo giorno, testa alta e cera nelle orecchie come Ulisse. Ma le Sirene che lo circondano non cantano amore e non intrecciano trame di reti nelle quali sarebbe dolce perdersi e addormentarsi come in un grembo di madre. Quelle Sirene non vivono il gioco di una sessualità negata, ma gridano e sputano veleno, deturpando nel profondo chi la sua vita in tacchi a spillo e abiti scintillanti vorrebbe solo viverla, sulla scena e in disparte. Una intima, profonda, incorrotta innocenza violata dal fango di chi si arroga la normalità: il solito vecchio scandalo della storia che si ripete da diecimila anni.</p>
<p>Uno scandalo che il travestito, conosce, indifeso: l’abbandono e il tradimento, il peggiore, quello che sua madre scrive sulla sua pelle bambina con la punta di un pennino che intinge nell'inchiostro nero e denso del rifiuto. Con quell'inchiostro al veleno lui scrive un doloroso amore: in un intreccio fra gioco, travestimento e ricerca di affettività. Il rifiuto di una donna troverà, forse,compensazione nella accettazione piena e incondizionata dell’altra donna.</p>

<p><strong>La Mission</strong></p>
<p>Raccontare storie e in specie storie di esclusione è la nostra vocazione, raccontarle in un continuo contrappunto musicale quasi d’obbligo, perché ogni vita ha un suo leit motive. Ogni storia il suo intimo mai completamente svelato perché.</p>
<p>Abbiamo cominciato la nostra trilogia con “Antonietta e Gabriele”, storia di una esclusione di due anime diverse eppure tanto simili nella Roma degli anni ’30, continuiamo ora con “Amor mio” gli anni sono i ’70, ma l’accettazione della diversità è ancora difficile. Oggi il mondo se non è il migliore dei mondi possibili, è un mondo che sia pure a stento e fatica, affrontando ostacoli e improvvise inversioni di rotta, si avvia ad essere migliore. Noi vogliamo che lo sia e utilizziamo i nostri ferri del mestiere per collaborare a questa costruzione.</p>

Since our last successful run at New York Theater Workshop this April, First Ladies Project has been offered the exciting opportunity to be presented by the Playwrights Horizons Theater School Festival, THE COOKERY. The plays chosen for THE COOKERY are selected based on the recommendation of faculty and staff at Playwrights Horizons Theater School.

First Ladies Project dives deep into 1776’s America with Martha Washington and resurfaces with Michelle Obama, coursing through the White House and unearthing the stories of this entirely American and oft-forgotten sorority. The tour is lead by an ensemble cast of five bright, earnest, unapologetic and deeply devoted women in classic period undergarments who inhabit the styles and hair-shapes of the First Ladies to resuscitate their memories and bring this truly electric hallway of portraits to life.

<h3>WHAT IS RECONSTRUCTION?</h3>
<p>Reconstruction is a play about a young woman named Sylvia who comes to grips with her father’s death through the help of her best friend- Abraham Lincoln. What better way to explore daddy issues than with one of the countries greatest fore-fathers? Life is one great anecdote with Lincoln as a roommate, until Syliva must chose between her fantasy world, and the reality of her father’s suicide. Laughs, tears, battle scenes- Reconstruction follows these two individuals as they attempt to rebuild their lives after their loss.</p>

<p>Alyssa has worked since 2010 as a professional stage manager and will be co-producing Reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Claudia Gomez-Restrepo: </strong></p>

<p>The Arc of Kitsap &amp; Jefferson Counties (The Arc) works to provide education, advocacy, and support to people living with Intellectual and Developmental disabilities (ID/DD) such as Autism, Cerebral Palsy, and Downs Syndrome, to have whole and successful lives in the community. The Arc also provides advocacy and support for the families, other loved ones, and care providers, in the work it does providing programs, services, and connection to community members and government agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What’s happening?</strong></p>
<p>The Friday Night Social or “the dance” is one of the Arc’s most beloved programs since 1978, and strives to increase social skills, meaningful participation, and self-determination, all in a recreational opportunity. It is an evening where community comes together, in a safe environment, to have fun, meet friends, and of course dance.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""70th Aniversary Dance"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/425737/pictures/full/20120905222252-88230NewS_83_20081023223748_ARCAnniversary_20081025.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since its founding in 1938, The Arc has gone through a number of changes. Due to a number of factors, including the economic downturn of the past few years, we have had to look at the realities of reorganization, needs for fundraising, and the options for scaling back or completely shutting down some of the Arc’s important programs; one of those is the dance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What can you do to help?</strong></p>
<p>Plain and simple, donate to save the dance! Direct costs for the dance are over $25,000 a year. That includes paying for a minimum of staff to oversee the dancing, socializing, and serving of food and drink. All the while ensuring everyone is safe and of course having a good time. It also includes the pizza, drinks, snacks, and once a month, birthday cake.</p>
<p>This of course does not represent the costs to provide a facility that can handle 150 to 300 participants and care givers, the overhead of providing communication and administration of the program, and other supporting expenses.</p>

The Arc also provides advocacy and support for the families, other loved ones, and care providers, in the work it does providing programs, services, and connection to community members and government agencies.
 
What’s happening?
The Friday Night Social or “the dance” is one of the Arc’s most beloved programs since 1978, and strives to increase social skills, meaningful participation, and self-determination, all in a recreational opportunity. It is an evening where community comes together, in a safe environment, to have fun, meet friends, and of course dance.

Since its founding in 1938, The Arc has gone through a number of changes. Due to a number of factors, including the economic downturn of the past few years, we have had to look at the realities of reorganization, needs for fundraising, and the options for scaling back or completely shutting down some of the Arc’s important programs; one of those is the dance.
 
What can you do to help?
Plain and simple, donate to save the dance! Direct costs for the dance are over $25,000 a year. That includes paying for a minimum of staff to oversee the dancing, socializing, and serving of food and drink. All the while ensuring everyone is safe and of course having a good time. It also includes the pizza, drinks, snacks, and once a month, birthday cake.
This of course does not represent the costs to provide a facility that can handle 150 to 300 participants and care givers, the overhead of providing communication and administration of the program, and other supporting expenses.

 
Can I do anything else to help?
We would love for you to share this with your family, friends, and coworkers. We make it easy, using the buttons below for FaceBook, and soon Twitter!
Our thanks to you for your time and donation!
Don’t let this be their last dance!

<p>My name is Kelly Nieto and I am the creator, songwriter, and producer of<em> The Cross and the Light, </em>an acclaimed musical dramatization of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of Christ<em>. </em>This extraordinary stage production has been described as the “Broadway version of the ‘Passion of Christ’” because of its original musical score, special effects, and high-caliber actors. <em>The Cross and The Light</em> will make its debut at the iconic Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts in Detroit for 11 performances from Sunday, March 24 to Easter Sunday, March 31, 2013.</p>
<h3>Why IndieGoGo?</h3>
<p>I know that hundreds of people at Music Hall will want to purchase <em>The Cross and the Light</em> CD. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to record a CD prior to our performance dates. That’s why we have created <em>The Cross and the Light</em> IndieGoGo Campaign!</p>
<h3><strong>Help us fund our LIVE CD from Music Hall this year!</strong></h3>
<p>Moving to a professional theater is a serious financial undertaking for our new production company. In addition to raising five children, my husband and I have personally funded the majority of this project since 2002. Thanks to a handful of generous donors we have been able to move to Music Hall, but we need financial assistance on this project. </p>
<h3>So I'm asking YOU for help!</h3>
<p>If we can get 280 people to purchase a CD in advance for only $25, we can create “<em>The Cross and the Light</em> - LIVE CD from Music Hall” this year!</p>
<p>As an added bonus for your help, your CD will be personally autographed by Kenny Watson, the man playing the role of “Jesus”, and Kelly Nieto, the creator and songwriter of <em>The Cross and the Light.</em></p>
<h3><strong>We only need to pre-sell 280 CDs during our campaign!</strong></h3>

<h3>It's Great Music and a Powerful Prayer!</h3>
<p>The Cross and the Light is not only about great music, it's a great prayer; a prayer that should be prayed all throughout the year, not just during Lent. So why not purchase the CD today. If you're like me and always looking for ways to evangelize to friends and family, purchase 2 or more CDs today and give them away as gifts! It's a great way to evangelize!</p>

<p>It is impossible to put a price on the spiritual impact of <em>The Cross and the Light</em>. For many, it is a spiritual wake-up call; a visual realization of what Christ went through on the Cross.

<h3><strong>A vision from God that changed my life and thousands of others!</strong></h3>
<p><em>The Cross and the Light </em>is a “vision” that God put on my heart while praying the Stations of the Cross for the first time on Good Friday in 2000. I had ever been in a church on a Good Friday, let alone prayed this prayer. By the 6th Station, I was overwhelmed with grief and spiritual pain. When I looked at the altar, I saw <em>The Cross and the Light </em>and heard God’s voice say, “This is why you are here!” I knew I had been CALLED for this work, but didn’t know <em>how</em> I could ever make it happen. For more details about Kelly's personal testimony, <a href=""http://crossandlight.com/index.php/about/the-story/founders-bio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Founder's bio"">click here.</a> </p>

<p>God heard my prayers and with the help of many, we created and produced the first version of<em> The Cross and the Light</em>, formerly known as Living Stations, in 2002 at Our Lady of Sorrows in Farmington. To bring the story to the masses, we founded Living Faith Fine Arts Apostolate, a501c(3) Non Profit Corporation, and produced <em>Living Stations </em>at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament in 2011 &amp; 2012. Over 44,000 people have experienced this epic theatrical event. </p>
<p>Remarkably, God has laid another important mission on my heart in 2012, to continue the story beyond the death of Christ by adding Act 2: The Empty Tomb to Pentecost. The union of Living Stations and the second act is now titled <em>The Cross and the Light.</em></p>
<h3>So what happens if we surpass our goal? </h3>
<p>Our next project is to fund a DVD of The Cross and the Light at Music Hall 2013. if we are able to raise more money on our CD campaign than is needed, we will start creating the DVD.

<p><strong> Tickets here: </strong><a href=""http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/370864"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/370864</a></p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Delaney Yeager. I'm a senior theater major at Pace University in NYC with a double minor in creative writing and fine art. Besides studying and writing, I intern for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart as well as AllThingsComedy.com. I've always known that I wanted to be a writer for TV, film, and stage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wrote Waiting for AAA after working on Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, knowing I would never be able to play or cast women in any of Godot's roles. I started toying with the idea of an all-female adaptation of Godot when it soon turned into an idea that wouldn't leave me alone. What started as an idea I just jotted down in an unorganized notebook is now a 73-page play with it's own story, characters, and shape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign is extremely important to me as Waiting for AAA, is the first full-length play I've ever written (or directed, for that matter) and my team and I need all the support we can get so this play can be the best it can be. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>Since the wonderful, student-run Studio 501 is a non-profit theater company, it is up to myself and the rest of the AAA ladies to fund the show, ourselves. We are asking for around $700 as I had the brilliant idea* of making a car the most necessary set piece in the show. We are currently in the creative process of figuring out how we will pull this off... we've realized it's not going to be the cheapest thing in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It isn't only the car that is throwing us into a financial bind. Your generous contributions will help us in every department; props, costumes, lights, printing fees, etc.</p>

<p>It is not only us and our audiences who get to reap the benefits of your donations... you will, too! Please see our ""Perks"" to the right and find out what you can get in return for what you have given us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, the show will go on. It just will go on looking a little less baller than it would had we reached our goal.</p>

<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>I wrote and submitted this play to Pace University's Studio 501 not only because I wanted the experience of seeing it on it's feet, but because I was hoping it would hit home with many of Pace's students. I have already found, by sharing the piece with my cast members, my crew, and my closest friends, that I was correct.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wrote this piece as a 22-year-old woman just a few months from graduating. It's an exciting though bizarre and frightening place to be. I know that the themes and subjects illustrated in Waiting for AAA are ones to which just about every one of us who will be walking in our caps and gowns this summer will relate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The play is also the only comedy among Studio 501's line-up this season, which I think is important! Everyone needs a good laugh - especially at the end of the semester.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Waiting for AAA gives a large handful of women the opportunity to show their theater program just how talented they are. Between the cast and crew, there are eleven very gifted, very bright women behind WFAAA, all of whom play major roles in making this a wonderful process (and a sure-to-be wonderful end product).</p>

 Tickets here: http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/370864
WHO ARE WE?
My name is Delaney Yeager. I'm a senior theater major at Pace University in NYC with a double minor in creative writing and fine art. Besides studying and writing, I intern for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart as well as AllThingsComedy.com. I've always known that I wanted to be a writer for TV, film, and stage.
 
I wrote Waiting for AAA after working on Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, knowing I would never be able to play or cast women in any of Godot's roles. I started toying with the idea of an all-female adaptation of Godot when it soon turned into an idea that wouldn't leave me alone. What started as an idea I just jotted down in an unorganized notebook is now a 73-page play with it's own story, characters, and shape.
 
This campaign is extremely important to me as Waiting for AAA, is the first full-length play I've ever written (or directed, for that matter) and my team and I need all the support we can get so this play can be the best it can be.

Going Beyond the Fables!

The Drexel Players are back for another round of fun at the Philadelphia FringeArts Festival! This summer, we need your help to bring our latest original play AE$OP to life. 
Everyone has heard one of Aesop's fables at some point in their lives - The Tortoise and the Hare, The Dog and Its Reflection, The Boy Cried Wolf. But not everyone has taken the time to dissect, contextualize, or even plain-old understand these sometimes-twisted stories.  That's where AE$OP takes over!

This mature take on the stories will encourage audiences to consider what these childhood lessons truly taught us.
Who are the Drexel Players?
 Good question, ambiguous potential donor! The Drexel Players are the only student-run theater organization at Drexel University. We strive to produce quality theater, engage the student body socially, and broaden students' knowledge and involvement in the Philly theater community. 
When it comes to our productions, students participate in all aspects from acting to design to publicity. Over the past two years we have staged two successful pieces for the FringeArts festival: MONUMENT in 2012 and Parts: A Speed-Through in 2013.

What We Still Need



As college students, the Drexel Players are no strangers to being thrifty (Ramen noodles, EasyMac, sneaking into dorms to do laundry on the cheap). Despite that frugal aptitude, theater can't always be bought at a 10-for-10 sale.  We try our best, like acquiring Drexel's URBN Annex Black Box for a killer performance space, but we still have some other costs to cover: 


Scenic Design - because our characters will be sitting in style


Props - because an office needs staplers, Post-its, water-coolers

Costume - because CEO's wear ties and blouses

Sound and Lighting- addressing the needs of two vital senses


Marketing - because people need to know when and where to show up
Incidentals - because laundry detergent doesn't grow on trees
Other - because you never know

<p>Since our founding, Nehara Dance Group has been struggling to survive on a daily basis.  Dance is an expensive enterprise, not widely funded.  We want to continue advancing our important message, inspiring change within the world of modern orthodoxy and dance.</p><p>It is not easy being a professional dancer with the rigorous schedule and demands of the profession (and our personal lives.)  Add to that the fact that we have a burning desire to remain true to our convictions - observing Shabbat, dress code, covering hair, you can see how complex our lives must be.  But, with Nehara this complexity is transformed into an opportunity to be  complete within our lives – and to share that completeness with thousands of others.</p>

<p></p>
<p><br/>Israel's dance world is very rich and developed, with an abundance of dance companies, large and small. But, there is no high-level, professional dance group which provides both a viable platform for dancers who live and believe in a religious lifestyle and a repertory that combines Jewish and universal themes.</p>
<p>Nehara expresses its uniqueness in two major arenas. First, we aim to create a <b>bridge between two worlds -- Judaism and professional dance</b> -- ensuring that all performances will maintain the highest professional standards of dance and theater. <b>Our goal</b> is to ensure that these two worlds, rather than opposing each other, will complement and strengthen each other.</p>
<p>Second, Nehara  performs before mixed audiences. By showing that a religious way of life is part and parcel of the members of the dance company, we aspire to attract the religious sector to our performances and similarly share our life experiences and art form with the secular sector.</p>

<p>Daniella Bloch (founder &amp; Artistic Director): ""<i>How does something go from being just an idea to becoming an actual living, breathing active project?</i></p>
<p><i>Nehara Dance Group started as an idea, a dream. At the time I didn't really realize what it meant or where it would take me but I knew that it felt right, at home, something I had to do.</i></p>
<p><span><i>The idea of Nehara is an outgrowth from my personal biography --  my life as a professional dancer alongside my belief and way of life as a Jewish orthodox woman -- and all the struggles that go along with these two alternate lifestyles.</i></span></p>
<p><i>Dance and religion do not mesh easily. On the contrary - they clash in almost every way possible. Yet, ever since I can remember, I have juggled my way between these two opposite worlds. However, growing up in a religious home which also had a great passion for the arts, gave me the strength and willpower to live and grow within both my "" identities,"" pursuing a very demanding career as a dancer while continuing to observe a traditional Jewish way of life keeping Shabbat, Kashrut laws and such.</i></p>
<p><i>Everything was a battle, a struggle to be who I am without compromise. But in the end , compromise was everywhere, on both sides.</i></p>
<p><i>From these experiences, these hardships, the idea of Nehara was born. Nehara is  a professional dance group providing a home, a professional feeding ground for orthodox female dancers who want to promote their careers as performers without compromising their religious way of life.  But, it is also more than that.  Over time, as I wanted to share my experiences with my religious friends I would invite them to performances of mine.  For many of them this was their first exposure to dance and it was a real eye-opener.  All of a sudden they began to understand the many ways in which one's body can speak, tell a story and share profound emotional experiences.  To this day, they remain a loyal and engaged audience.  </i></p>

<h3>Questions &amp; Answers</h3>
<div><b></b></div>
<p><b>How is it that orthodox women perform before mixed audiences ( men and women )?</b></p>
<p>We believe that as a dancer and artist it is important to be a part of the dance community. This demands a high level of performance.  It also exposes dancers to what is new and upcoming within the dance field, enables them to be part of the community and take part and contribute to the changes that are taking place. Without this you become irrelevant. It is like any community, you must be physically part of and participate in the communal activities.  It this case, this translates into rehearsals and performances.  We feed off each other's successes and creations. This is how you become excellent.</p>
<p>As individual Jewish women, performing only for women is not part of our belief system. We believe in respecting our bodies and our place within the Jewish community and keeping to the traditional laws of Judaism but men seeing us dance is not an issue for us.. What is important to us is to bring under one roof the passion and love we have for our Torah-based belief system and raising our children in a religious home and our professional lives as dancers.  </p>
<p>It is also important for us to be able to serve as a bridge between the secular and orthodox communities in Israel. Sitting next to each other in a theater during a performance is one way of doing that. </p>
<p><b>Who funds us?</b></p>
<p><b>No one.</b> For the past three years we have been functioning on a low - no budget. Private funding has been invested in the group by Daniella Bloch ( Artistic Director) who deeply believes in this venture and its importance. In addition, we received a modest one-time grant from the Mifal Hapayis in Israel for a new work. </p>
<p><b>Where do we perform? </b></p>
<p>Nehara has performed in some of  Israel's major theaters - Suzanne Dellal Center, Tel Aviv, The Gerard Bahar Center, Jerusalem. Inbal Theater, Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>We participated in several major dance festivals - “Between Heaven and Earth” (Jerusalem), “Machol Lohet” ( Tel Aviv ), “Emunah Festival for the Arts” (Beit Raban ), “International Exposure” (Tel Aviv )  and the major dance festival "" Arte Sacro "" in<b> Madrid.</b></p>
<p>We also perform in schools to students and give lectures and workshops on the connection between dance and religion.</p>
<p><b>Do all of our dance pieces correspond with Jewish Issues?</b></p>
<p>No. We believe artists need to bring their entire selves and experiences from life to the stage.  Therefore, Nehara's creations deal with universal issues such as womanhood and our daily struggles, alongside relevant Jewish issues and content, such as prayer, spiritual journeys, covering one's hair, etc..<br/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Does the group work only with women?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Within the studio we work only with women professionals - Dancers, Choreographers, Teachers, Rehearsal Directors, Costume designers, etc.</p>
<p><b>Do we promote dance education to students?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We deeply believe in the importance of what we do and its educational aspect. Some of us  are teachers as well, and we use this platform to educate children on the importance of understanding the complexity and possibility of fusing these two ways of life together - dance and religion. </p>
<p>Nehara Dance Group is part of the Israel's Sal Tarbut Artzi, an educational program offering cultural programming for high school, grade school, and kindergarten children all over Israel.</p>
<p><b>Where will the funding go?</b></p>
<p>The funding will go to studio and theater rentals, costumes, lighting design, dancers fees, set designs, and other production costs.<br/></p>

<p>Some people are extremely excited and moved by what Nehara Dance Group is doing. They feel it is sorely needed with the Jewish orthodox community and brings a new and unique platform for dialogue and change.</p>

Nehara symbolizes the challenge of the Jewish modern orthodox woman combining a professional dance career without compromising her observant way of life.
Revolutionary within the dance world and the orthodox world – Nehara's performances are open to all audiences - orthodox and secular, men and women,  Nehara's unique creative works serve as vehicles bringing together Jewish and universal content and bridging the Jewish world and the professional dance world.

What is important to us is to bring under one roof the passion and love we have for our Torah-based belief system, raising our children in a religious home, and maintaining high standards as professional dancers.It  also important for us to be able to serve as a bridge between the secular and orthodox communities in Israel. Sitting next to each other in a theater during a performance, talking about and sharing one's feelings about the performance are other ways of doing that.For more info, check our Press Kit.


Your support counts!


Nehara Dance Group has brought a new vision to the world of dance and the Jewish community. Over the past three years we have performed to sold out theaters throughout Israel, performed for Jewish communities abroad, given workshops and lectures in schools to students about the complexity of our way of lives , combining our observance of Jewish faith and laws with our passion and will to dance professionally.

Today, all this is in danger of coming to an end.

No artistic institution including dance companies can survive anywhere in the world without government and/or private funding. We receive neither.  We are a young group with a big vision and have been promoting ourselves independently both artistically and financially.
With your support we can continue:



performing


giving workshops


speaking to youth

expanding our artistic and communal activity.

Your support will allow us to keep our ""home""and it will enable us to continue bringing the important messages of diversity within the Jewish faith and the extraordinary richness of the culture of dance to thousands of people. 








Since our founding, Nehara Dance Group has been struggling to survive on a daily basis.  Dance is an expensive enterprise, not widely funded.  We want to continue advancing our important message, inspiring change within the world of modern orthodoxy and dance.It is not easy being a professional dancer with the rigorous schedule and demands of the profession (and our personal lives.)  Add to that the fact that we have a burning desire to remain true to our convictions - observing Shabbat, dress code, covering hair, you can see how complex our lives must be.  But, with Nehara this complexity is transformed into an opportunity to be  complete within our lives – and to share that completeness with thousands of others.

extensively. In 2006, current owner John Trickey stepped in for much 
needed improvements, including a new roof and the digital marquee. We are committed to staying open no matter what it takes. The one change we must make to stay open is the purchase of a digital projector. By early 2014, film prints will no longer be available. The cost
 of this projector is approximately $70,000. We don't expect our patrons
 to contribute every penny of this, but every donation from the 
community brings us closer to our goal. We have 
been overwhelmed by the generosity our patrons! We are now within 
$25,000 of our goal. Please keep donating to The Cinema. Your help means
 everything.Please, support your neighborhood movie house! Save The Cinema Theater! Make its 100th birthday the greatest yet! Check out the great perks your generosity will bring!",0.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<i>Homo File</i>'s Story</h3><i>Homo File</i> is a Queer history performance project chronicling
the life of iconoclast Samuel Steward (1909-1993). Steward was a college
professor, friend to Gertrude Stein and Dr. Alfred Kinsey, a groundbreaking
author of homoerotic fiction, an influential tattoo artist, and sexual rebel
who lived in the Bay Area before dying in his 80s, nearly forgotten.<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/585656/files/20140517091709-images.jpg?1400343429"" src="""" style=""""/>                                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619205/files/20140601203843-Image_7.jpg?1401680323"" src="""" style=""width: 183.338px; height: 274px;""/><br/></p><p></p>
<p>Samuel Steward's life story is an essential Civil Rights story
and reflects the experiences of many LGBTQ ancestors whose lives have been
erased from the historical record and tragically forgotten. We are preserving
Sam's legacy and we need your help to make it happen. Your contribution will
help produce the first staged production based on Sam Steward's life and you’ll
also be supporting an incredible team of artists.</p>
<p>The title <b><i>Homo File </i></b>is a fusion
of Sam Steward's <i>Stud Files</i> (meticulous records he kept of his
sex life) and <i>""homophile,""</i>  the alternative to <i>""homosexual,""</i> used
by early gay Civil Rights activists.  <b><i>Homo File </i></b>combines  performance, original music, puppetry,
aerial dance, video, and visual art to examine Steward’s life 20 years after
his death. Because Sam meticulously described all of his sexual encounters, his
memoirs fill in missing pieces of Queer history (1930 through 1969) when the
majority of the nation’s LGBT community lived underground in fear of being
fired, jailed and socially ostracized. His creative output provides windows
into the life of a gay man who accepted his sexual orientation and examined his
impulses as sources of self-knowledge and artistic vision.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/585689/files/20140517094105-140216_HomoFile-5210.jpg?1400344865"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

Her screen image was that of a hot-blooded Latin seductress, dressed in fanciful costumes and sparkling jewels.

Hola...I am an actress, writer and community activist from the South Bronx and for the last 3 years I've been writing a one-woman show about an ""unnamed"" New York City actress who wants to transform into 1940's film star Maria Montez..but first she has to take a Journey, a Journey to the Dominican Republic that will forever change her life. I was  awarded a grant to write the show and now I need your help in order to bring the show to life. This is the first time I will be performing an Orginal work that will be debuting in my hometown of the South Bronx...a community that is in need of artists and stories that will help them continue living with hope in neighborhoods that can at times be harsh. I know that my work will continue to evolve here in the South Bronx.  


ABOUT THE SHOW 
(The show will debut September 29-October 3,2011... 6 shows. Directed by Padraic Lillis)

Tickets go on sale June 29


Pretending to be Maria Montez Queen of Technicolor is a one woman multi-media show that tells the story of an “Unnamed” New York City actress as she is transforming into the 1940’s Dominican Hollywood film star María Montez, and in the process reconnects with her Dominican roots, her mother, and explores the strength of her spirituality while living in the South Bronx. For the performance Dalia Davi alternates between story telling, two short films and photo projections. There will be a talk back after each performance with the intention of gaining feedback on the themes raised during the performance. Including the search of an identity in a foreign country, escapism, spirituality, the parallels of the “Unnamed” actress's Journey and María Montez’s Journey, the power that images and Hollywood have on the sub-conscience, and the role of the artist during a time of war. 


ABOUT MARÍA MONTEZ
Maria Montez (June 6, 1912 – September 7, 1951) was a Dominican born motion picture actress who gained fame and popularity in the 1940s as an exotic beauty starring in a series of filmed-in-Technicolor costume adventure films. Her screen image was that of a hot-blooded Latin seductress, dressed in fanciful costumes and sparkling jewels. She became so identified with these adventure epics that she became known as ""The Queen of Technicolor."" Over her career, Montez appeared in 26 films, 21 of which were made in United States and five in Europe. 




The Impact
On June 3, 2011 I read an excerpt of the show to a group of 60 kids from Maine, kids that had never been to the South Bronx and their response was amazing. They were so eager to learn more about different cultures and understand our community, which at times has not been well represented in the mass media. The story I am telling with this show will have a tremendous enlightening impact for the youth of the South Bronx and all over the country.
 Once I am able to raise the money to produce the show, I plan to tour schools, translate the show into Spanish and hopefully take it to the Dominican Republic and other Spanish speaking countries. But what I wish the most is to raise awarness within the New York City theater community about the budding artist community of the South Bronx, and to invite everyone to come to Pregones Theater, which is one of the most beautiful theaters in the City.
