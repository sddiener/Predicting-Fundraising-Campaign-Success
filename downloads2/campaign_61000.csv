<h3>About NESA Night Camp</h3>
<p><span>Our <strong>NESA Night Camp</strong>, with a late summer start, will reach inner city and disadvantaged youth ages 6 to 12 years old during their most critical window of development. Currently, there are several hundred kids in the greater Boston area who cannot attend summer camps or programs and are left playing in the streets and crime-filled neighborhoods during the summer. New England Sports Academy can address the need for a summer camp for a thousand children through our scholarship initiative combined with our incredible camp offerings, leaders in training program, and our world-class coaches. We are confident that the scholarship students will grow immensely as people and incorporate the skills and values learned into their lives!</span></p>
<p><span>For every donation made, we will share the stories of the scholarship recipients who benefitted from the program! </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>New England Sports Academy has launched a separate program as a part of this project. A variety of camps, from dance to basketball to mixed sports to soccer will be available from 4-8pm on each weekday of the summer. It costs only $200 per child to attend a week of camp! Our goal is to raise money to cover the cost of accommodating 100 kids in this program, AND transporting them from downtown Boston to NESA and back.</span></p>
<p><span>Each year, we have over 300 kids from local towns attending one or several of our 10+ camps. They are able to choose what they would like to do each day: dance, soccer, gymnastics, basketball, parkour, academics, or perhaps be a princess or a pirate. We would love to give the same options to disadvantaged youth as well.</span></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Many inner city families cannot afford to provide their kids with the exciting experience of summer camps. We would like to help them bring their kids together and build the community through athletics, academics and fun! Sports teach lots of life lessons, such as teamwork, goal setting, hard work, communication skills and many more. This is why we want to make this opportunity available for those who cannot afford it.</span></p>
<p><span>We will be including a ""leaders in training"" course for the scholarship recipients. The topics in this course include: goal setting, negotiation, team building, public speaking, qualities of leadership, types of leaders, informal/formal leaders, and financial interest.</span></p>

The object of its research goals are:<p></p><p>• Improve the quality of life of Dialysis patients and reduce their mortality.</p><p>• Provide a clinical solution for treating small children that require chronic Dialysis.  Today, many infants and small children cannot receive chronic hemodialysis because their blood volume is too small.

CLINICAL BENEFITS </b><b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 38px;"">OF WAK™ WILL BE AS FOLLOWS:</b><br/><p></p><p>·<span> 
</span>Daily dialysis normalizes the blood pressure of
ESRD patients, eliminating or greatly reducing the need for blood pressure
medications.  Normal blood pressure
achieved by daily dialysis or continuous dialysis with the WAK™ would also
greatly reduce the incidence of strokes and heart attacks that Dialysis patients
currently experience.  These incidents
often require hospitalization and can be disabling or even fatal.

</p><p>·<span> 
</span>Patients with kidney failure do not eliminate
excess water from their bodies, since they produce little or no urine.  The retained fluid accumulates in the lungs,
resulting in severe breathing problems. 
As fluid that accumulated over two or three days must be removed bluntly
over three or four hours, this fast, unnatural removal causes great discomfort
and increases the risk of strokes and heart disease.  Fluid overload is one of the main causes of
hospitalizations in this population. 
Daily dialysis has been shown to eliminate this problem, as would use of
the WAK™.</p>
<p>·<span>  Dialysis </span>Patients retain large amounts
of phosphorus, which becomes toxic.  In order to address this problem, patients
receiving dialysis three times per week have to swallow 12 to 15 pills a day in
order to remove the excess phosphorus through the gut.  In daily dialysis, excess phosphorus is
removed without the need for any pills. 
The WAK™ has been shown in animal and human studies to remove the same
amount of phosphorus as in daily dialysis. 
Continuous dialysis using the WAK™ would not only eliminate the
patient’s need to swallow 12 to 15 pills a day (and save associated expenses),
but would also greatly reduce the incidence of bone disease in these patients.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Shunts (connections between an artery and a vein)
used in conventional dialysis, often clot or become infected.  This results in the need for repeated
surgical interventions and hospitalizations. 
Repeated and more frequent needle insertions with daily dialysis have
already resulted in increased need for surgical procedures.  The WAK™ is connected to a vein via a
specially designed catheter, in a less complex outpatient surgical
procedure.  The WAK™ blood connection is
expected to greatly reduce infections incurred by patients and avoid painful
repeated needle sticks. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Dialysis patients using conventional dialysis
are often malnourished, which results in a greater risk of infection and other
complications.  Daily dialysis has been
shown to eliminate malnutrition in Dialysis patients.  The WAK™ has been shown in animal and human
studies to have the same biochemical effects as daily dialysis and, therefore,
it is likely to eliminate malnutrition.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Conventional dialysis treatment does not remove
enough salt from the body, but daily dialysis does.  Accumulation of excess salt in Dialysis patients
is a common cause of high blood pressure and heart disease.  This condition requires imposing severe
restrictions on the salt intake of dialysis patients.  The WAK™ would allow patients to ingest salt,
making food more palatable.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Dialysis patients in rural areas are subject to
additional hardship and expense since they often have to travel great distances
to get to the nearest dialysis unit.  The
WAK™ would reduce the frequency and duration of those trips.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Dialysis is physically debilitating such that most
dialysis patients are unable to work  and earn a living.  Daily dialysis has been shown to rehabilitate
these patients and greatly increase their ability to work and exercise.  </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Daily
dialysis greatly enhances patients’ quality of life with respect to the
frequency of shots and pills and the time required to travel frequently to
clinics.</p><p> · 
Foods commonly consumed by healthy people become
restricted for Dialysis patients, further hindering their quality of life.  Failure to observe these restrictions can result
in serious complications, including bone disease, strokes and heart disease,
and sometimes, even death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately daily dialysis remains,
for the most part, impractical due to operational constraints at dialysis
centers.  If each patient were to spend
more time on dialysis machines every week, additional machines, space and
personnel will be needed.  Many centers
already lack adequate facilities and staff resources at their present levels of
utilization, in which patients only receive treatment three times a week. </p><p> </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/720418/files/20140715195518-HEMODIALYSISROOM.png?1405479318"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Dialysis Clinic/Hospital Room, we believe may soon no longer be necessary!</p><p>There is little investment incentive to build
twice as many units as we have today, and insurance carriers and taxpayers show
no desire to pay more for dialysis time. 
Further, there are not enough nurses and technicians to allow for the
delivery of daily dialysis.  While home
dialysis is a viable alternative to providing more frequent and longer dialysis

(""the Foundation""), an IRS approved Non-Profit Charitable Organization, to raise public awareness and support research to give Dialysis patients their life back.ABOUT DIALYSIS PATIENTSThere are more than 2 million patients being treated for End Stage Renal Disease (""ESRD"") globally, with over 570,000 receiving treatment in the US. ESRD (""Dialysis"") patient numbers continue to grow steadily at 8% annually worldwide and most of this growth is attributed to an aging population, increasing obesity, diabetes and hypertension due to genetic predisposition as well as increasing adoption of Westernized dietary habits. Additionally, China and India, where about 1/3rd of the worlds population reside,  have recently announced that they will be providing coverage for ESRD, which should increase the global ESRD patient population by millions.
PRESENT TREATMENT FOR DIALYSIS PATIENTS
The only treatment for ESRD is Dialysis or a kidney transplant, if you are that lucky, as the vast majority of patients waiting for kidney transplants will pass before a new organ becomes available for them.The average mortality rate for US Dialysis patients is about 20%. This means that approximately 20% of US Dialysis patients will not survive each year. SO WHAT IS THE WAK™ AND HOW CAN IT HELP ?     The WAK™ is a miniaturized dialysis machine that can be worn as a belt by a patient.  The WAK™ operates on batteries and weighs less than 10 pounds, allowing patients to wear the device continuously instead of being tethered to conventional dialysis machines several days a week for many hours.                                               Trial Participant wearing 1st Prototype in United Kingdom WAK™ Trialit is this miniaturization, like the computer, which went from a system that took up an entire floor to the tablets and laptops we now use, that provides the Dialysis patient the possibilities we are now discussing.                                    Miniaturization is the AnswerWHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PRESENT STANDARD DIALYSIS TREATMENTWith the approval of the WAK™,   we believe that millions of Dialysis patients in the US and around the world will no longer be tethered and chained to a refrigerator sized machine for 3-4 hours a day, 3 times week, and spend the days between such treatments recuperating from the effects of such treatments. We believe that they will no longer be subject to the many possible hardships, resulting from standard dialysis, such as:•Anemia •Arrhythmia •Blunt and massive changes in fluid balance •Brain strokes •Coronary disease •Depression •Disability •Draconian diets •Endothelial dysfunction •Fluid restriction •Hemodynamic instability •Hyperparathyroidism •Insufficient clearance of “middle molecules” •Insufficient  phosphorus removal •Left ventricular hypertrophy •Neurological deficit •Poorly controlled hypertension •Poor removal of protein bound toxins •Poor sleep •Post dialysis fatigue •Salt restriction •Sleep apnea •Sudden changes in electrolyte concentration and pHWho is Developing the WAK™ and what is its status?The WAK™ is being Developed by Blood Purification Technologies, Inc. (""BPTI""), a Washington state Corporation. At the present time, the FDA has approved the WAK™ to commence its human clinical Trial #1 of 5 trials to be conducted. While most of the costs of Trial #1 have been paid, BPTI still needs approximately $400,000 to complete Trial #1. Your assistance is vitally requested.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE FOUNDATION ?
The Wearable Artificial Kidney Foundation is an IRS approved Charitable Organization that has been formed for the purpose of both raising awareness to the plight of Dialysis patients and addressing several unmet needs in the treatment of Dialysis patients. The object of its research goals are:• Improve the quality of life of Dialysis patients and reduce their mortality.• Provide a clinical solution for treating small children that require chronic Dialysis.  Today, many infants and small children cannot receive chronic hemodialysis because their blood volume is too small. The miniaturized size of the WAK™ will, for the first time, allow babies to be dialyzed on a chronic basis.The Foundation will be doing so by funding the neccesary research, including FDA human clinical trials on the Wearable Artificial Kidney, which has already had successful human clinical trials in Italy and the United Kingdom.WHAT DOES THE FOUNDATION NEED?The Foundation needs only one thing - FUNDING and it needs it Critically !!!!!
REASONS TO DONATE TO THE FOUNDATION
It is critical to move the WAK™ through all 5 planned clinical trials in order to allow the use of the WAK™ by the general public. It is the goal of the Foundation to improve the lives of millions of Dialysis patients and give them back their lives, through the use of the WAK™.It is also immensly important to raise public awareness of the human cost of today's standard dialysis treatment.WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS OF THE FDA TRIALS ?
WHAT ARE THE APPROXIMATE COST OF FDA TRIALS ?
The cost of FDA mandated trials are calculated to run around $35 Million. The Foundation will make every attempt to raise as much of this as is possible, with other funds being raised by alternative methods.If you can’t contribute, for any reason, but you understand the importance of this project, please let all of your friends and colleagues know about our project.We thank you from the bottom of our heart, as will every Dialysis patient once the WAK™ is approved and available worldwide.
WHAT ARE THE CONTEMPLATED END RESULTS OF USING THE WAK™ ?
We, as many others, believe that patients will live longer and their quality of live will be real. We also believe that patients will be able to function as productive citizens, work, play, eat many foods otherwise restricted, such as oranges, bananas, ice cream, salt intake, etc. and live longer healthier lives all at a cost to their governments which are substantially less than they expend now.In addition, we envision that the WAK™ will provide superior clinical results for patients and give Dialysis patients back a more normal life.Our belief is based upon the many clinical benefits described below through daily Dialysis and we believe that the WAK™ will deliver no less.
Treatment for kidney disease represents more than 10% of U.S. healthcare spending at a cost of over $30 Billion annually and is steadily
rising.  It is our belief, which is shared by many others, that the use of the WAK™ will result in a annual savings to the U.S. of approximately $10 Billion. 
WHAT IS THE FDA INNOVATION PATHWAY 2.O PROGRAM ?

In March 2012 the WAK™ won the the FDA’s Innovation Pathway 2.0 award, which was
created to speed pioneering and life saving devices to market.  The
FDA has indicated it is committed to the goal of shortening the time from
development to market, and the WAK™ has been actively engaged
with a specially formed FDA team for “hands on” collaboration that is intended
to accelerate the approval process of the WAK™. 
This collaborative effort has resulted in the approval of the human use of the WAK™
in the U.S. for clinical research purposes.  
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE ABOUT THE WAK, PLEASE VIEW THE FOLLOWING 30 MINUTE LECTURE GIVEN BY THE INVENTOR OF THE WAK™ IN SHANGHAI CHINA DURING A HEMODIALYSIS SYMPOSIUMWE BELIEVE THE
CLINICAL BENEFITS OF WAK™ WILL BE AS FOLLOWS:· 
Daily dialysis normalizes the blood pressure of
ESRD patients, eliminating or greatly reducing the need for blood pressure
medications.  Normal blood pressure
achieved by daily dialysis or continuous dialysis with the WAK™ would also
greatly reduce the incidence of strokes and heart attacks that Dialysis patients
currently experience.  These incidents
often require hospitalization and can be disabling or even fatal.

· 
Patients with kidney failure do not eliminate
excess water from their bodies, since they produce little or no urine.  The retained fluid accumulates in the lungs,
resulting in severe breathing problems. 
As fluid that accumulated over two or three days must be removed bluntly
over three or four hours, this fast, unnatural removal causes great discomfort
and increases the risk of strokes and heart disease.  Fluid overload is one of the main causes of
hospitalizations in this population. 
Daily dialysis has been shown to eliminate this problem, as would use of
the WAK™.
·  Dialysis Patients retain large amounts
of phosphorus, which becomes toxic.  In order to address this problem, patients
receiving dialysis three times per week have to swallow 12 to 15 pills a day in
order to remove the excess phosphorus through the gut.  In daily dialysis, excess phosphorus is
removed without the need for any pills. 
The WAK™ has been shown in animal and human studies to remove the same
amount of phosphorus as in daily dialysis. 
Continuous dialysis using the WAK™ would not only eliminate the
patient’s need to swallow 12 to 15 pills a day (and save associated expenses),
but would also greatly reduce the incidence of bone disease in these patients.
· 
Shunts (connections between an artery and a vein)
used in conventional dialysis, often clot or become infected.  This results in the need for repeated
surgical interventions and hospitalizations. 
Repeated and more frequent needle insertions with daily dialysis have
already resulted in increased need for surgical procedures.  The WAK™ is connected to a vein via a
specially designed catheter, in a less complex outpatient surgical
procedure.  The WAK™ blood connection is
expected to greatly reduce infections incurred by patients and avoid painful
repeated needle sticks. 
· 
Dialysis patients using conventional dialysis
are often malnourished, which results in a greater risk of infection and other
complications.  Daily dialysis has been
shown to eliminate malnutrition in Dialysis patients.  The WAK™ has been shown in animal and human
studies to have the same biochemical effects as daily dialysis and, therefore,
it is likely to eliminate malnutrition.
· 
Conventional dialysis treatment does not remove
enough salt from the body, but daily dialysis does.  Accumulation of excess salt in Dialysis patients
is a common cause of high blood pressure and heart disease.  This condition requires imposing severe
restrictions on the salt intake of dialysis patients.  The WAK™ would allow patients to ingest salt,
making food more palatable.
· 
Dialysis patients in rural areas are subject to
additional hardship and expense since they often have to travel great distances
to get to the nearest dialysis unit.  The
WAK™ would reduce the frequency and duration of those trips.
· 
Dialysis is physically debilitating such that most
dialysis patients are unable to work  and earn a living.  Daily dialysis has been shown to rehabilitate
these patients and greatly increase their ability to work and exercise.  
· 
Daily
dialysis greatly enhances patients’ quality of life with respect to the
frequency of shots and pills and the time required to travel frequently to
clinics. · 
Foods commonly consumed by healthy people become
restricted for Dialysis patients, further hindering their quality of life.  Failure to observe these restrictions can result
in serious complications, including bone disease, strokes and heart disease,
and sometimes, even death.
Unfortunately daily dialysis remains,
for the most part, impractical due to operational constraints at dialysis
centers.  If each patient were to spend
more time on dialysis machines every week, additional machines, space and
personnel will be needed.  Many centers
already lack adequate facilities and staff resources at their present levels of
utilization, in which patients only receive treatment three times a week.  Dialysis Clinic/Hospital Room, we believe may soon no longer be necessary!There is little investment incentive to build
twice as many units as we have today, and insurance carriers and taxpayers show
no desire to pay more for dialysis time. 
Further, there are not enough nurses and technicians to allow for the
delivery of daily dialysis.  While home
dialysis is a viable alternative to providing more frequent and longer dialysis
it only reaches 10% of the ESRD population.  Again, we believe that the WAK™ will deliver the clinical benefits of daily dialysis as well as a major enhancement to the patients’ quality of life.THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORTWe hope that Mary's story, and maybe some of the rewards, have encouraged you to take part in this Indiegogo fundraiser.

                        Today we have a working prototype, but in order to bring QLIPP to the world, we need your help. We’re raising funds to build the mold, purchase materials and gain FCC and CE Bluetooth certification. Each of these steps will be critical to our ability to manufacture QLIPP and give people everywhere an easy way to improve their game.        The QLIPP sensor is currently in the DVT (Design Verification Testing) Stage. This will ensure the manufacturing quality of your QLIPP sensor. After this stage we will be sending your QLIPP sensor for electronic certification (FCC and CE). What this means is we will be obtaining a license for this electronic product to be used in your geographical region. Once this certification is approved, your QLIPP sensor will be shipped immediately. In the meantime, you will also be provided with timely updates and will be kept posted of our progress. The video below is a short clip of our manufacturing process and electronic testing of our beta trial units.     With your help, we can get QLIPP into the market. Also, once we’re funded, we have plans to expand into other sports like racquetball, running, baseball and many others. Just imagine the potential.    
 
We started with a vision to make QLIPP something that could help all tennis players play better. After 2 years of testing and R&D, we’re sure that QLIPP can fulfill our goal and we’re excited that your help can bring us one step closer. The QLIPP team is part of 9 Degrees Freedom, a company founded in February 2012 by Donny Soh and Cen Lee, a pair of entrepreneurs with a passion in innovative lifestyle sports technologies. 9 Degrees Freedom is incubated by NTUitive, a startup accelerator from NTU.
 
What you see today is the result of more than two years of Research and Development. A lot of effort, resources and promises have been poured into this and we are truly happy and excited to be able to have the opportunity to present to you and the tennis community, the QLIPP sensor.
You can be well assured that we are fully committed to delivering your QLIPP sensor.

A: The battery is able to last for 4-6 hours per charge.     Q: Do I have to inform the app of the types of strokes that I will be doing?  A: No. After you have selected whether you are a right or left hander, our sensor is able to differentiate your serves, forehands and backhands automatically by measuring the corresponding vibrations of each type of stroke.      Q: How long has the QLIPP sensor been in development?  A: 9 Degrees Freedom was established in 2012 and the QLIPP sensor has been in constant development for the past 2.5 years.     Q: Has the QLIPP sensor been tested with actual tennis players?  A: Yes, we have tested our sensor with ex-pro tennis players, tennis coaches and also club players for the past few years.",35.0,10,"1 Campaign

<li>Roswell has already booked their convention center and committed to having all of their 4th graders there. They have also committed to giving us the use of their museum, which is right next door to the convention center. </li>
<li>We were interviewed by the local press in Sanford, NC and Roswell, NM. In fact, we made the front page of the newspaper in Roswell. This told me that we were on to something because this was just the scouting mission. Just think what they would do for the ""real thing"".</li>
</ul><p>We have partnered with the 100 Mile Club®, a childhood fitness charity that challenges kids to run (or walk) 100 miles in a school year.  In fact, we will be running right past their headquarters in Norco, California, on the second day of our event. The 100 Mile Club® is currently operating in over 700 schools in all 50 states, as well as Canada, New Zealand, and Japan.   In addition to paying registration, each coast-to-coast runner has committed to raising $2,000 to be used to provide scholarships for nationally-recognized sports fitness programs.  Your donation will provide us with the funds to hold this coast-to-coast event, which in turn, will spark a renaissance in childhood health and fitness.</p>

</p><p>Batu
Biologics is a privately held immunotherapeutic company with laboratories at
Janssen Research and Development in San Diego, CA. The company was founded by Samuel Wagner and Dr. Alan Lewis subsequent to a successful $26 million exit from Dr. Lewis's former
company Medistem Inc.  Through leveraging
existing manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical relationships, the company is
in late stage preclinical development for two immunotherapy products.  The products are anticipated to enter
clinical development through the FDA IND process in Q1 2015 (ValloVax).</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>ValloVax <b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); line-height: 26px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><i>-  A novel cancer vaccine
targeting the tumor endothelium</i></b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>Tumors
cannot grow larger than 1-2 millimeter in diameter without stimulating new
blood vessels to feed them, demonstrating that new blood vessel formation
(angiogenesis) is critical to sustainable tumor growth.  Blocking angiogenesis led to the development
of multibillion dollar blockbuster drugs such as Avastin ($5.9 billion 2012),
Sunitinib ($1.2 billion 2012), and Revlimed ($3.2 billion 2011).  Unfortunately these drugs target only one
pathway of the angiogenesis process, and as a result tumor remissions are
temporary, and in many cases not sustainable (for example 2011 FDA retraction
of breast cancer indication for Avastin). 
ValloVax is based on leveraging the immune system’s ability to selectively
seek and destroy tumor-associated blood vessels, while sparing non-malignant
blood vessels.  Proof of concept has been
demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and the company is currently refining GMP
manufacturing protocols together with Cook General Biotechnology.</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b>Use of Proceeds</b></h3><p><b>

Biologics is seeking $100,000 to: 1) Define release criteria for ValloVax and

in late stage preclinical development for two immunotherapy products.  The products are anticipated to enter
clinical development through the FDA IND process in Q1 2015 (ValloVax).
ValloVax -  A novel cancer vaccine
targeting the tumor endothelium
Tumors
cannot grow larger than 1-2 millimeter in diameter without stimulating new
blood vessels to feed them, demonstrating that new blood vessel formation
(angiogenesis) is critical to sustainable tumor growth.  Blocking angiogenesis led to the development
of multibillion dollar blockbuster drugs such as Avastin ($5.9 billion 2012),
Sunitinib ($1.2 billion 2012), and Revlimed ($3.2 billion 2011).  Unfortunately these drugs target only one
pathway of the angiogenesis process, and as a result tumor remissions are
temporary, and in many cases not sustainable (for example 2011 FDA retraction
of breast cancer indication for Avastin). 
ValloVax is based on leveraging the immune system’s ability to selectively
seek and destroy tumor-associated blood vessels, while sparing non-malignant
blood vessels.  Proof of concept has been
demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and the company is currently refining GMP
manufacturing protocols together with Cook General Biotechnology.Use of Proceeds
Batu
Biologics is seeking $100,000 to: 1) Define release criteria for ValloVax and
secure clinical grade manufacturing 2) Additional IND enabling mouse studies 3)
Filing of IND application for ValloVax

And the language is often not a language we understand. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>HealthWords can help solve this problem. We offer health education in a non intimidating language and environment, in a medium you can use at your convenience. We also give you a community in which to share your education, giving you the opportunity to see others using HealthWords, near and far. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We make it easy and fun to learn the things you need to take care of yourself or your loved ones, and to understand conversations with your friends and colleagues that once made you uncomfortable because of jargon you did not understand.  We are helping to create a better dialogue for engagement. You may have a clean bill of health,  but it is likely that you or someone you know is not so lucky.

<h3>What's the connection between oral health and overall health?</h3>
</div>
<div>Did you know that your oral health can offer clues about your overall health — or that problems in your mouth can affect the rest of your body? Understanding the intimate connection between oral health and overall health is key to staying healthy.</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Taking good care of your mouth, teeth and gums is a worthy goal in and of itself. Good oral and dental hygiene can help prevent bad breath, tooth decay and gum disease—and can help you keep your teeth as you get older.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Researchers are also discovering new reasons to brush and floss.  A healthy mouth may help you ward off medical disorders. The flip side? An unhealthy mouth, especially if you have gum disease, may increase your risk of serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, poorly controlled diabetes and preterm labor.*</span></p>
</div>
<p>Like many areas of the body, your mouth is teeming with bacteria — most of them harmless. Normally the body's natural defenses and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, can keep these bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth decay and gum disease. </p>

<h3>Why is it so important to stay properly hydrated?</h3>
<p>Whether you’re a serious athlete, recreational exerciser, or just trying to stay healthy, it’s important to make sure you get the right amount of water before, during and after exercising. Water regulates your body temperature, lubricates joints and helps transport nutrients for energy and health. If you’re not properly hydrated, your body will be unable to perform at its highest level, and you may experience fatigue, muscle cramps, dizziness or more serious symptoms.</p>Water is life.  You <em>need </em>water to eliminate toxic substances, produce digestive enzymes, maintain healthy skin, hair and organs, and to help your body absorb essential vitamins, minerals and natural sugars.  Water also regulates body temperature, stimulates metabolism and helps promote regularity.  Fluids other than pure water don’t act the same as water in your body, and they don’t meet your needs for hydration like water does.  Most people are slightly dehydrated from relying on other fluids besides water for their fluid intake.  Coffee, tea, alcohol, sodas (or any other caffeinated beverages) don’t count; they’re diuretics, which means they actually remove water and nutrients from the body.<br/>

<h4><b>How do we measure Breath Quality? </b></h4>
<p>Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs) are created by anaerobic bacteria biofilms in the mouth.  VSCs can be elevated by certain foods and beverages you consume and may also indicate gum disease and tooth decay.  In all cases, elevated VSCs can reduce breath quality and increase social anxiety about your breath.</p>
<p>(Our Breath Quality Sensor is measuring: Hydrogen Sulfide, Methyl Mercapthan and Hydrogen Disulfide levels in parts per billion)</p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>How do we measure Hydration?</b></h4>
<p>Detecting hydration levels in the mouth is accomplished by measuring the moisture level of your mucus membrane - which is the first place where dehydration symptoms occur.  The importance of maintaining hydration levels for optimal health and wellness continues to grow.  Mint detects hydration where it first shows signs of impact.  Certain medications can also cause dry mouth- or oral dehydration.   Mint provides information about the state of oral hydration and allows you to track hydration level trends and will present recommendations on how to improve your overall hydration goals.</p>

</div></div>","Importance of Oral Health + Hydration



What's the connection between oral health and overall health?

Did you know that your oral health can offer clues about your overall health — or that problems in your mouth can affect the rest of your body? Understanding the intimate connection between oral health and overall health is key to staying healthy.


Taking good care of your mouth, teeth and gums is a worthy goal in and of itself. Good oral and dental hygiene can help prevent bad breath, tooth decay and gum disease—and can help you keep your teeth as you get older.  Researchers are also discovering new reasons to brush and floss.  A healthy mouth may help you ward off medical disorders. The flip side? An unhealthy mouth, especially if you have gum disease, may increase your risk of serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, poorly controlled diabetes and preterm labor.*

Like many areas of the body, your mouth is teeming with bacteria — most of them harmless. Normally the body's natural defenses and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, can keep these bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth decay and gum disease. 
*Additional details on Oral Health: http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-...





Why is it so important to stay properly hydrated?
Whether you’re a serious athlete, recreational exerciser, or just trying to stay healthy, it’s important to make sure you get the right amount of water before, during and after exercising. Water regulates your body temperature, lubricates joints and helps transport nutrients for energy and health. If you’re not properly hydrated, your body will be unable to perform at its highest level, and you may experience fatigue, muscle cramps, dizziness or more serious symptoms.Water is life.  You need water to eliminate toxic substances, produce digestive enzymes, maintain healthy skin, hair and organs, and to help your body absorb essential vitamins, minerals and natural sugars.  Water also regulates body temperature, stimulates metabolism and helps promote regularity.  Fluids other than pure water don’t act the same as water in your body, and they don’t meet your needs for hydration like water does.  Most people are slightly dehydrated from relying on other fluids besides water for their fluid intake.  Coffee, tea, alcohol, sodas (or any other caffeinated beverages) don’t count; they’re diuretics, which means they actually remove water and nutrients from the body.

Chronic dehydration has been linked to the following symptoms and disease processes:  Fatigue, constipation, headaches, indigestion, muscle and joint aches and pains, high blood pressure, depression, allergies, lack of mental clarity, skin issues and excess weight.Introducing Breathometer Mint

Introducing Mint™- the worlds first portable Breath Quality and Hydration level detection product.  Simply place Mint in your mouth, let it automatically draw a sample of the air in your mouth and within seconds the Breathometer app on your smartphone will let you know the quality of your breath, as well as how hydrated you are. 



How do we measure Breath Quality? 
Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs) are created by anaerobic bacteria biofilms in the mouth.  VSCs can be elevated by certain foods and beverages you consume and may also indicate gum disease and tooth decay.  In all cases, elevated VSCs can reduce breath quality and increase social anxiety about your breath.

Research projects: TDI's research projects have included immunoparasitological studies in experimental mouse models of Chagas disease, vectorial competence of mosquitoes to transmit Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis and Rift Valley Fever virus, safety of the blood supply, Chagas disease epidemiology in Ecuador and in the USA, among others. 
 
The contributions of TDI:  Faculty and students have been instrumental in the initiation of a Chagas disease control and T. cruzi blood screeningprograms in Ecuador.

<p><span>In one elegant product, we have incorporated all the best proven practices for enhancing and transforming a person’s life.

Our exclusive training system has taken over 10 years of development at our clinic in Harley Street – the address for cutting-edge wellness practices in London.</span></p>

<h3><strong>HELP US CHANGE LIVES</strong></h3>
<p><span>We embarked on this journey because we have seen first-hand the incredible life-changing results ME System 24 achieved as a method on so many people at our clinic. We wanted to be able to offer it to the world, not just those with access to the exclusive Harley Street environment. That led us on a two-year journey of how to administer ME System 24 through a consumer product which culminated in ME Clock and ME Clock App. With your support, we now want to change as many lives as we can around the world.</span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/793679/pictures/full/20130505153047-29.jpg?1367793051"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/793183/pictures/full/20130505092438-18.jpg?1367771080"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h3>
<p>ME Clock helps you overcome negative thought patterns that have built up over time and prevented you from being the ME you want to BE. Think of your mind like a computer. For a computer to perform at an optimum level, negative programs (or viruses) need to be removed and replaced with fresh applications and positive programs. The result is a faster more efficient computer that completes any task you assign, without stalling or breaking down. ME Clock retrains you to use your mind to overcome these negative thought patterns, allowing you to flourish and effortlessly achieve your goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/793593/pictures/full/20130505144634-26.jpg?1367790397"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The latest brain science says that when your mind wants something and your emotions agree, you win. But if there is conflict, you lose. To achieve any goal you want, your mind and emotions need to be in sync. ME Clock helps bridge this gap. That’s when change occurs and positive habits are born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/793183/pictures/full/20130505092438-18.jpg?1367771080"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>CHANGE YOUR LIFE AS YOU SLEEP</strong></h3>
<p>ME Clock is used before, during and after you sleep, enabling you to make the most of your down time. Instead of spending your day chasing your dreams, you can now spend your day living your dreams. Minimum effort for maximum effect – that’s ME Clock.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/793673/pictures/full/20130505152804-28.jpg?1367792890"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The ME System 24 training protocol, delivered by ME Clock via ME Programs and ME 101, consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ME-START</strong> – 10 minutes each morning to motivate and energize you for the day ahead, tailored with empowering scripts in relation to the ME Program you’re working on.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>ME-FRESH</strong> – 15 minutes each evening to clear all the cumulative stresses of the day from your mind and body, preparing you for a restful night’s sleep through audio scripts correlating to the ME Program you’re working on. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>ME-SET</strong> – <span>works as you sleep, helping you to eliminate negative thought patterns relevant to the ME Program you’re working on. While you are in the right part of sleep, ME Clock or ME Clock App plays a track for 45 minutes. The track is delivered at a very low audible level, to keep you soundly asleep as it helps you dissolve negative patterns and replaces them with positive thoughts.</span>

<h3><strong>HOW DO I KNOW IT WORKS?</strong></h3>
<p><span>Because over the past 10- years integrated medicine expert and personal development coach, Mike Squirrell, developed ME System 24 at his Harley Street clinic in London and successfully administered it as a therapy on thousands of patients including professional athletes, business executives, royalty and celebrities</span></p>
<p> <em>Here is what a few of them have said about ME System 24:</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Mike Squirrell is one of the most inspiring people I have ever encountered. When I first met him at his practice on Harley Street it's fair to say I didn't quite know what to expect in terms of results but after just one session of his ME System 24 treatment I was blown away. The energy created in the room that day was so powerful it opened me up to the amazing possibilities within me. It made me realise that change for the greater good of myself and those near to me was not only possible but easy. After a few more treatments the change in me in terms of what I could achieve, how I felt about myself, the improvement in all my personal relationships, how possible it is to achieve my goals in life and make personal dreams come true are now deeply instilled in me. I'll never forget the confidence and amazing energy that ME System 24 gave me. To this day like I was after my very first session I'm brimming with confidence and energy, feel like I'm 10 ft. tall and that anything is possible.”</strong></p>
<p><em>Craig Kelly - Celebrity, Actor, TV Personality, London</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Mike is quite simply a miracle healer in every sense of the word!”</strong></p>
<p><em>Amanda Ghost - Music Producer, 3-time Grammy Nominee, London</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“After walking away from my last ME System 24 treatment I felt quite light-headed and suddenly optimistic. By the end of that week Mike's magic was like a crazy miracle, all the heavy grief had lifted. I could think clearly and not feel so broken-hearted; the following week I was excited to embrace independent life. Mike allowed me this re-gaining of my former self. He is the best kept secret in the world of Harley Street medicine!”</strong></p>

<h3><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</strong></h3>
<p>We have now designed, developed and built the ME Clock prototype by working with award-winning London design agency “Therefore” (who were behind the successful “Gravity Light” Indiegogo campaign last year). We have also designed and built a Beta version of ME Clock App, launched our website, and recorded the 12 ME Programs and additional features at our London studio totaling 50 hours of mastered content.</p>
<p>To get ME Clock into the marketplace, we now need your help. With your contributions, we can fund production costs, expand the size of our team and increase our marketing outreach.</p>
<p>We have spent the last two years and all of our own funding getting ME Clock to the verge of market launch. By reserving a ME Clock now, you can make this happen. With the funds for our first production run, we can expose ME Clock to a community of early adopters who will help spread the word to a bigger marketplace as quickly as possible and build a nonprofit organization through which we can donate our training methods to schools and the disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Our goal is to get ME Clock and ME Clock App into as many people’s hands as possible to help change as many lives around the world as we can – <em><strong>starting with yours!</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/793088/pictures/full/20130505081448-8.jpg?1367766890"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><em><strong>                                   Thank you for your support!</strong></em></h3></div>","ME Clock is the Ultimate Digital Life Coach: a personal trainer for your mind that empowers you to become the ME you want to BE. Whether your goal is becoming thinner, richer, happier, fitter and smarter or conquering stress, low self-esteem, or poor energy levels, this is the revolutionary system and product that can make it happen.
We are all creatures of habit, and bad habits, formed by years of negative thought patterns, that can be hard to break. That’s where ME Clock enters the picture – using technology, it empowers you to create and sustain positive habits on-demand anytime, anywhere.
In one elegant product, we have incorporated all the best proven practices for enhancing and transforming a person’s life. ME Clock delivers ME System 24, a very specific sequence of targeted mind empowering exercises, behavioural modification, learning techniques, emotive music and meditation to help you keep your life on track 24/7 at the press of a button. Our exclusive training system has taken over 10 years of development at our clinic in Harley Street – the address for cutting-edge wellness practices in London.
In one sleek, stylish and simple to use product, we have combined all you need to help you achieve any goal in life. A groundbreaking hi-tech consumer product that incorporates millennia of self-improvement thought and practices, ME Clock marks a new era in personal development - and now you can be among the first to own it.
 

 

HELP US CHANGE LIVES
We embarked on this journey because we have seen first-hand the incredible life-changing results ME System 24 achieved as a method on so many people at our clinic. We wanted to be able to offer it to the world, not just those with access to the exclusive Harley Street environment. That led us on a two-year journey of how to administer ME System 24 through a consumer product which culminated in ME Clock and ME Clock App. With your support, we now want to change as many lives as we can around the world.


HOW DOES IT WORK?
ME Clock helps you overcome negative thought patterns that have built up over time and prevented you from being the ME you want to BE. Think of your mind like a computer. For a computer to perform at an optimum level, negative programs (or viruses) need to be removed and replaced with fresh applications and positive programs. The result is a faster more efficient computer that completes any task you assign, without stalling or breaking down. ME Clock retrains you to use your mind to overcome these negative thought patterns, allowing you to flourish and effortlessly achieve your goals.
 

The latest brain science says that when your mind wants something and your emotions agree, you win. But if there is conflict, you lose. To achieve any goal you want, your mind and emotions need to be in sync. ME Clock helps bridge this gap. That’s when change occurs and positive habits are born.
 

CHANGE YOUR LIFE AS YOU SLEEP
ME Clock is used before, during and after you sleep, enabling you to make the most of your down time. Instead of spending your day chasing your dreams, you can now spend your day living your dreams. Minimum effort for maximum effect – that’s ME Clock.

The ME System 24 training protocol, delivered by ME Clock via ME Programs and ME 101, consists of:


ME-START – 10 minutes each morning to motivate and energize you for the day ahead, tailored with empowering scripts in relation to the ME Program you’re working on.


ME-FRESH – 15 minutes each evening to clear all the cumulative stresses of the day from your mind and body, preparing you for a restful night’s sleep through audio scripts correlating to the ME Program you’re working on. 


ME-SET – works as you sleep, helping you to eliminate negative thought patterns relevant to the ME Program you’re working on. While you are in the right part of sleep, ME Clock or ME Clock App plays a track for 45 minutes. The track is delivered at a very low audible level, to keep you soundly asleep as it helps you dissolve negative patterns and replaces them with positive thoughts.



HOW TO BECOME THE ME YOU WANT TO BE

Sign up for a ME Clock or ME Clock App pledge package.
When your package arrives, do the ME 101 program for 7 days to become level-set.
Select any ME Program from your pledge package that corresponds to the area in your life where you want to see positive change and use for 7-21 days.
Use Sleep Solutions, ME Sound, Nature Sounds and ME Books as support for your mind & emotions whenever you need it.
Meet the New You.
 
 


WHAT DOES COME WITH?



ME 101 – a 7-day entry level program to get your mind and emotions level-set before moving onto specific ME Programs.


Sleep Solutions – to help you achieve a better night’s rest.


ME Sound – music to stimulate your mind and emotions any time of the day or night.


Nature Sounds & White Noise - to help you achieve the right ambient environment in any room of your home.


ME Books – to help guide you on your journey.
(Sleep Solutions, ME Sound, Nature Sounds & White Noise and ME Books are collectively known as the Lifestyle Suite.)
 
* ME Clock is also a stylish digital alarm clock radio and stereo designed to fit into any bedroom space.
 
 
HOW IS APP DIFFERENT?
ME Clock App has exactly the same functionality as ME Clock, but the audio is delivered through the phone’s speaker, headphones, or docking station. The audio was created to work perfectly with your Android or iPhone speaker. Those who are happy to have their phone in their bedroom or are always on the move may prefer ME Clock App to ME Clock.
The App is available for iPhone and Android platforms.

<h3>About Water Ecuador<br/>
</h3>
<p>Water shouldn't be brown.  It shouldn't taste bad or have dirt in it.  And when you put it in a petri dish, it shouldn't grow thick, red colonies of bacteria.  In Isla Puna, a small island 4 hours from the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil, we found some of the dirtiest water we've ever seen, and it makes people ill.  And we're teaming up with Cecilia  Villar Eljuri to change that.</p>
<p>Water Ecuador (<a href=""http://www.waterecuador.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.waterecuador.org</a>) is a non-profit based in Muisne, a rural town in coastal Ecuador.  We were founded in 2007, and focus on innovative, high-impact, measurable solutions to comprehensively address the global water crisis.  We take a social entrepreneurial approach to our work, believing that development should be long-term and self-sustaining.   A good drinking water program empowers a community to provide itself with clean water every day, generation after generation, not simply for a few months or years, and in order to do so, we form lasting relationships with the communities where we work. </p>
<p>Currently, we run 6 small water centers in rural Ecuador that provide clean water to over 2000 people daily as well as running several educational initiatives to teach children and adults about the importance of clean water.  We plan to build our 7th on Isla Puna and to raise money with a concert.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
Here is the plan in a bit more detail.



We need to raise about $16,000 to build a water center.  (Here is the budget breakdown from our last center which opened in March 2013).
Once a water center is open, it stays sustainable by charging a very low cost for the water -- 1/2 to 1/6 of the market cost and just enough to pay our water center manager and for any repairs.
We are raising money from several sources for the project and have thus far received generous donations from Chobani and the Rotary Club of Essex Connecticut.
We have teamed up with Cecilia Villar Eljuri to host a Water Ecuador benefit concert on October 9th to help us move $2000 closer to our goal.




The Impact

The Isla Puna community will receive clean water.
A water center manager gets a job to support his or her family.
You get to attend an awesome concert on October 9th, and get some other great freebies.

   The Phlex EDGE is the first fitness tracker created by swimmers, for swimmers. This revolutionary hardware incorporates patented machine learning technology to provide real-time heart rate for swimmers, advanced stroke analysis, and thousands of professionally written workouts all in a seamlessly designed, and incredibly intuitive device worn on-goggle. In The Press  Why Not A Watch? You wouldn't run a marathon in sandals, so why train for swimming wearing a watch. Watches and chest-worn heart rate monitors are cumbersome and bulky, which increases the chances that your stroke will suffer. Lose those inefficiencies and embrace the EDGE technology, a head based, hydrodynamic design that's virtually unnoticeable when being worn. All In One Solution  It's as simple as threading your goggle strap through the EDGE and going for a swim. The process has been designed to be as simple as possible so that you can focus more on your workout.

<h3>SAVING THE BRUMBLEY'S</h3>
<p><em><strong>My name is Tammy Swets and I'm going to tell you the story of a major battle my family has been going through for years. In 2008 Ralph Brumbley (my father) developed a big knot on his neck. At first we all figured it was just an infection. He took some antibiotics he had and the knot kept getting bigger.</strong></em> <em><strong>He made an appointment to find out what was causing this knot. Many scans and xrays were done and a day before Thanksgiving we recieved a phone call stating he had cancer of the throat. He went through numberous sessions of chemo and radiation and a surgery he only had a 5% chance of making it through. He had to have a feeding tube inserted into his stomach due to the radiation burning his mouth so badly it damaged saliva glands and caused major burns. His cancer has recently went into remission but sadly the battle isn't over. The radiation left him with a damaged mouth. His jaw bone was burned so much it crumbled. He has no saliva in his mouth because the glands were so destroyed that eating is impossible. However the feeding tube was removed and he now lives by trying his best to eat although the pain with trying to eat is severe. He is on several medications for pain and still we are treating scabs and burn wounds. He was told he needs a surgery to fix his jaw which consists of taking a piece of a bone from his hip. Again the chances of him making it out of the surgery are very slim and all the surgery will do is fix the bone in his jaw but will do nothing for his wounds in his mouth. Right now he is surving by drinking Osmolite 1.5 Cal. This use to be what he fed himself with through his feeding tube. Since he no longer has taste buds he drinks as much as he can to stay alive. Sadly since the feeding tube was removed the insurance no longer covers his Osmolite. Then when we though it couldn't get worse in September I recieved a call from my father stating I needed to come over quick. I rushed to my parents home. My mother had became very weak and her breasts were becoming deformed and bleeding. We rushed her to the local Emergency room to find out she needed to be admitted. The doctor came in and said that she has terminal breast cancer, diabetes, and a cist on her ovaries along with a cist on the outside of her leg. We were told she would not survive. The first question that came through my mothers mind wasn't about herself. She worried that my dad would forget all his appointments and the fight he fought so hard for to be there with her and to die with her. Right at that moment we all prayed. We refuse to give into this diagnoses. My mother had a biopsy done at the hospital and a port put in for chemo to start. The doctors lanced her leg and drained the cist she had and thankfully it was not cancerous. Both of my mothers breasts were found to be nothing but tumors there was no breast tissue left. We were then told after a scan was done that the cancer was pressing against her heart cavity and that she could possibly have a heart attack. The treatment given to her is not to save her. The chemo they used was only to shrink the cancer not to kill it. My mothers heart started to get weaker so the chemo had to be lessoned. The doctors then added to the list of diagnoses that she also has pulminary disease. The cancer is aggressive and my mother will be starting radiation in a week. She has several places around her heart that are severe and the doctors believe that if they do not radiate that the cancer will pass to the bone which will cause a horrible and painful death. Everything they are doing is to insure they make her death as painless and comfortable as possible. Yet we are praying for a miracle. My mother decided to stay home and raise us as we were growing up so we recently were told she could not recieve disability. She is falling through every loop hole there is when it comes to medicaid. We were told she can only receive medically needy. If you know anyone who has cancer or had you know that the costs of treatment are beyond what 1,400 a month can take care of. Keep in mind on that income they have a payment to make for their home, to feed themselves, to pay co-pays and to pay for treatments that medicare will not pay for such as bone density scans which we are told her bones are showing weakness. </strong></em></p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We marked the goal for 5,000 because we know there are so many others in the same situation and we want everyone out there who needs a donation to get one. Right now the current medical bills are over 10,000 and growing. We are receiving threatening letters stating they will be put into collections and even some stating they will stop treatment. They really need your help. As for the perks we don't have a lot to give other thanks and appreciation and prayers. What we will do is keep you informed on treatments to show you what your donation help pay for. We will give you links to a facebook site to where you can follow us every step of the way. You will get a personal thanks from Janice and Ralph by email or mail. We will also send photos. On facebook we will be posting intimate photos of what our family is going through along with pictures of my fathers tumors, radiation photo's, surgery photo's. We will also be posting photos of my mothers port for her chemo and blood. Her leg but not alot having to do with her breasts since its personal. We will also be posting paperwork to give you proof of what your helping with. We know sometimes its hard to believe without seeing and we understand that. All these things will be on facebook for you to see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Basically a dollar helps loads. Your donation will help with medications that cost over 100's of dollars. We believe that even with the prognoses that there is hope and you may be part of a miracle of saving their lives. It will help with treatments they couldn't afford. It will insure she wont suffer a horrible death if that is the outcome. You will be helping provide a family with peace.</p>

Simply press the top mounted button and slide the device over the text. As it scans, the words will be read aloud in real time using a small, discreet Bluetooth earpiece.  Hidden Abilities, the startup company responsible for the Read 'n Style pen, is backed by the full support of  The KU Catalyst, the University of Kansas' student business accelerator. The Catalyst has been an invaluable resource for the team, providing office space, mentoring,  continuing education, professional contacts, and more.    The Read ‘n Style pen does more than just read text aloud for struggling readers, it helps kids learn to overcome obstacles on their own, boosting their self-confidence and making them more independent. Seeing the written words as they hear them pronounced has been shown to help students increase the size of their sight words, build their vocabulary, and improve their spelling.By using the Read ‘n Style pen, your son or daughter will become more efficient, knocking out their schoolwork in a fraction of the time. And because the Read ‘n Style pen can’t store information, students can use it on tests with no risk of cheating.The Read ‘n Style pen also helps students learn broad topics and concepts because it allows them to learn in a way that is better suited their learning style. That's important because the value of reading isn't the reading itself, but the ability to understand the information that is encoded in the text, and that's what makes the Read 'n Style pen such a powerful tool.   Anxiety free readingThroughout a normal school day, many teachers give handouts that they expect their students to read. This can be a nightmare for those that struggle with slow reading speed. The Read ‘n Style pen can ease your student’s nerves, letting them calmly listen to the text as they follow along. Knock out homework in minutes, not hoursAn hour of homework easily turns into three for students with dyslexia. By allowing students to listen to the text as they follow along, the Read ‘n Style pen decreases homework time while increasing the amount of material students are able to digest and comprehend.  Use the Read ‘n Style pen on tests with no risk of cheatingFor many schools, the go-to “solution” for testing is to pull the student out of the classroom so the test can be read aloud without disturbing the other students. This can be humiliating for students who just want to fit in with their classmates. Because the Read ‘n Style pen can’t store information, students can use it on tests with no risk of cheating. This means your child will never again have to experience the pain and embarrassment of being pulled from the classroom. Great for on the go studentsPeople with dyslexia often have difficulty tracking words on the page. This problem is only made worse when you’re traveling in a vehicle. With the help of the Read ‘n Style pen, students can complete homework on the bus ride home or during a weekend trip Put they joy back in readingThe Read ‘n Style pen brings stories to life. By reading text aloud, the Read ‘n Style pen helps struggling readers paint mental pictures, making reading enjoyable. From now on, accelerated reader points will be a breeze.       For the millions of Americans who struggle with dyslexia, reading can be the single biggest obstacle to achievement. All too often students with dyslexia are pushed away, held back, and swept under the rug. That ends now. We’ve created the Read ‘n Style pen to give students the tools to succeed. The idea for the Read ‘n Style pen began when Jamee was in elementary school. Like many others, she struggled with reading. When Jamee had homework, she went to her mom for help, and the two of them would sit at the kitchen table taking turns reading. Jamee would read a page out loud and her mom read the next to her. They would repeat this process back and forth until they were finished. When it was her mom’s turn to read, Jamee would follow along with her, reading the words on the page as her mom pronounced them out loud. Seeing the words, then listening to them pronounced helped Jamee understand what she was reading, improved her spelling, and built her vocabulary. Flash forward to 2013; Jamee’s in college trying to read the “wall of text” her professor assigned. “There’s no way I’ll even be able to finish half of this!” Jamee thought to herself in frustration. “I wish there was a better way.” Suddenly, the memories of all those late nights and early mornings reading with her mom came back to her, and she thought, “What if I had a device that did just what mom had done?” Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled throughout the room. The Read ‘n Style pen was born. At least that’s how Jamee tells it.     ""Proud Dyslexic"" TierBy backing our project at the “Proud Dyslexic” tier, you'll be among the first in the world to own a Read ‘n Style pen. As a reward for supporting our campaign you'll receive save $70 off the retail price. (MSRP: $396.99) By selecting this per you'll receive one Read 'n Style pen, one micro USB charger, and one set of Bluetooth earbuds. ""Proud Dyslexic Family"" TierDyslexia run in families so why not offer a bundle package at a special price. Back at the “Proud Dyslexic Family” tier and receive two Read ‘n Style pens, two micro USB chargers, and two sets of rechargeable Bluetooth earbuds for a combined $170 off the retail price. We'll even combine shipping. ""Honorary Dyslexic"" TierThese ""Empowered By Dyslexia"" T-shirts are conversation starters. Our mission, beyond the Read ‘n Style pen, is to create a change in the way society views dyslexia and to spark discussions about learning disorders in households around the world. Help us start that conversation by backing at the ""Honorary Dyslexic"" tier. That way you can start sporting these t-shirts, custom designed by Becky to help you spread awareness and create better public understanding.Printed by Payden's former high school technology teacher and a group of his current students, RAIDER Ink, $1 from each transaction will go towards helping the student led charity, RAIDER relief. We'll be in touch after the campaign to get your size and color choice.  Since we began working on this three years ago, we’ve had a lot of ups and downs and false starts, but we’ve kept at it, always pushing forward. We’ve been incredibly fortunate in our pursuit of this, linking together with the just the right people at just the right time. It’s our great pleasure to introduce our team.  After more than 9 months of work, Shane completed the first working prototype of the read ‘n Style pen in April. From there we contacted several contract electronic development companies, looking for someone to help us design a custom printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) that fits our needs. After shopping around and evaluating several different options we found a small company that has been in business since 1981, developing electronics mainly for the railroad and aviation industries. Their small size and personal feel is what attracted us to the company because they are able to give us the personalized attention we need. We have been working with them on the Read ‘n Style pen since the middle of August and we should have an engineered prototype very soon. From there we will need to integrate the software we've been developing in house with the new PCBA, finish out the housing design, and decide on packaging.  When all is said and done, we should be able to ship out the rewards by the end of February. But to be clear, we aren’t going to cut corners in order to meet that deadline. These things take time and sometimes stuff happens that we can’t foresee. Our promise to you is that we will make our best effort to complete the project on time so we can ship out the rewards by the end of February. If we can’t do that we'll be forward and honest about it, letting you guys know about it as soon as it becomes apparent that we won’t be able to make the deadline. EDIT: We ran into a few issues in development that delayed the project. We've since gotten past the hurdles that slowed us down and should begin shipping orders by mid July if things continue to go as well as they have been lately. My sincerest apologies for the delay.   We are asking for $40,000 so we can make our first production run. The money will be used to cover the one-time fixed development costs needed to produce the first unit, as well as the variable costs needed to manufacture each unit that is ordered through this campaign. For fixed costs, we will be using the capital raised for FCC certification testing, an injection mold to create the housing, transportation for our input material, a software development kit for the text-to-speech voice engine, and product liability insurance.For variable costs, we’ll need to cover the cost of supplies and machine time for our first production run.

Many are beneficial to people and help us build healthy immune systems. But some germs are dangerous and life threatening—especially to babies and their underdeveloped immune systems. Most adults have fully developed immune systems, but babies and infants don’t and should have additional protection from potentially harmful germs. And now with Ellie, they do. <br/><br/><strong>Why not sterilize like my parents did?</strong><br/>The biggest risks are new and emerging viruses, like superbugs, that simply weren’t a threat to ours and previous generations. Superbugs are resistant to some or all of the most commonly used antibiotics. However, superbugs are fully susceptible to the TRUVIOLET™ UV light found in Ellie. Just 60 seconds in Ellie and superbugs are rendered completely harmless. So without muss or fuss, boiling water or steam, Ellie safely and quickly sterilizes in 60 seconds. And you can take it with you wherever you go.<br/><br/><strong>What is TRUVIOLET?</strong><br/>TRUVIOLET is the most advanced and effective digital UV LED technology developed. TRUVIOLET is compact and powerful, fast and convenient, deadly to superbugs, and completely safe to use. Most existing UV solutions feature mercury lamps, which can easily break. TRUVIOLET, on the other hand, is a microchip. So Ellie is 100% mercury free and completely non-toxic. <br/><br/><strong>How does TRUVIOLET kill germs?</strong><br/>When germs are exposed to the ultraviolet light of TRUVIOLET, they absorb it and trigger a photochemical reaction that breaks their DNA. Once their DNA is destroyed, the germs can’t replicate and pose no threat to babies, infants, children, adults, or pets.<br/><br/><strong>Aren’t we supposed to avoid UV light?</strong><br/>UV light occurs naturally; you’re exposed to it whenever you’re exposed to sunlight. While everyone needs some exposure to UV light to stay healthy, it’s also important to protect our skin and eyes from intense exposure. Ellie is designed so that neither caregiver nor baby is ever exposed to the UV light. It is 100% contained inside the case. When Ellie’s door is opened, the UV LEDs turn off. <br/><br/><strong>Where else is UV light used?</strong><br/>Ultraviolet light is widely used in hospitals to disinfect patient rooms where it eliminates bacteria and viruses like E. coli, Staph and other germs that can cause severe illness or death. It’s also used to fight superbugs such as MRSA that can’t be killed by traditional methods using chemicals or antibiotics. UV light is also used for skin therapy to combat diseases like psoriasis, eczema, rickets and jaundice. In every case, UV light has proven to be effective at disinfecting and sterilizing surfaces, air, water and objects to prevent disease and illness.<br/><br/><strong>What infections does Ellie prevent?</strong><br/>Ellie helps prevent infections such as MRSA (which causes pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia); E. coli (which causes diarrhea and septicemia); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (which causes diarrhea); and Salmonella (which causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea and nausea). <br/><br/><strong>How effective is Ellie?</strong><br/>Independent third party laboratories have tested the TRUVIOLET technology inside Ellie and confirm that it eradicates superbugs and more with 99.9% germicidal efficacy in just 60 seconds.<br/><br/><strong>How do I use Ellie?</strong><br/>Simply place bottles, binkies, small toys and anything else that needs to be sterilized inside Ellie. Use a wet wipe or water to remove any dirt or milk on the objects. Put the bottle upside down with the opening facing the UV LED. Place the nipple on the middle shelf where UV LED light can get into both the exterior and interior surfaces. Rest pacifiers at the bottom, below the shelf next to the bottle. Close the door, making sure it’s locked, and press the button at the top. In 60 seconds, everything is sterilized. <br/><br/><strong>Does Ellie need batteries?</strong><br/>Ellie uses a rechargeable battery with micro-USB charging interface. It’s safe for air travel and good for at least one week when used up to twenty times a day.<br/><br/><strong>Why is Ellie’s interior coated with aluminum?</strong><br/>Ellie's sterilization chamber is coated with highly reflective, food-safe aluminum material to help bounce the sterilizing UV light multiple times—and in numerous directions—back and forth inside the chamber. This helps expose the maximum surface area of the baby’s feeding products to the ultraviolet light. <br/><br/><strong>Is Ellie BPA free?</strong><br/>Yes, Ellie is made of high quality, BPA-free, food-grade plastics to ensure the highest quality, safety, and environmental responsibility.<br/><br/><strong>Can Ellie sterilize breast pump accessories?</strong><br/>Ellie can be used to sterilize parts from common breast pumps, such as the cup, nipple shield, connector valves and milk bottle. Just place these parts inside Ellie and make sure they sit correctly above the UV LED lights to get maximum UV exposure. Again, please don't overfill the Ellie case chamber with too many parts at once.<br/><br/><strong>Can Ellie purify water for formula?</strong><br/>Yes. Fill a bottle with water, place the bottle in Ellie without anything over the opening, and Ellie will simultaneously sterilize the bottle’s interior and purify the water inside.<br/><br/><strong>What else can Ellie sterilize?</strong><br/>Ellie was designed for baby bottles and pacifiers,  and it’s also great for sterilizing exposed surfaces of other everyday items that can transmit germs, such as cell phones, tablets, TV remote controls, coffee mugs, key chains, toothbrushes, dentures, utensils, small toys, etc. But please remember not to overfill the Ellie case with too many items at once.<br/><br/><strong>Is Ellie compatible with all baby bottles?</strong><br/>Ellie is compatible with most baby bottles on the market. To ensure best results, we recommend bottles made by the following brands: Philips Avent, NUK, and MAM. These bottles have simple designs and no complicated geometries inside the bottle. Ellie is compatible with Dr. Brown bottles, except for the anti-colic tube which is difficult for Ellie's UV LED light to get into. Please avoid putting elongated tubes inside Ellie for purpose of sterilizing their interiors.<br/><br/><strong>Is Ellie waterproof?</strong><br/>Ellie is water resistant. It can be wiped with a wet cloth, but not washed against running water or put into a dishwasher.<br/><br/><strong>How big is Ellie?</strong><br/>Ellie is 7.6 inches wide (193 mm), 9.33 inches tall (237 mm), and 3.7 inches deep (94 mm).<br/><br/><strong>What is Ellie’s retail price?</strong><br/>$129.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478829262/xjo3xbvztc1jfhiylonk.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>","Goes wherever you go.Ellie is lightweight and portable enough to take anywhere so you’re never without a sterilized bottle, pacifier or teething ring. Small enough to fit into a diaper bag, Ellie’s week-long battery life makes it the perfect sterilizing solution while on the go. It is also the perfect place to hygienically store your baby’s bottles and pacifiers.  Works at the push of a button.Simple-to-use, one-touch operation allows busy parents to sterilize any items that go into their babies’ mouths quickly and easily—even when their hands are full. Eradicates the bad stuff quickly.Ellie kills 99.9% of harmful germs and bacteria in just 60 seconds without the worry of boiling, steaming or harsh chemicals.

Ellie is compatible with Dr. Brown bottles, except for the anti-colic tube which is difficult for Ellie's UV LED light to get into. Please avoid putting elongated tubes inside Ellie for purpose of sterilizing their interiors.Is Ellie waterproof?Ellie is water resistant. It can be wiped with a wet cloth, but not washed against running water or put into a dishwasher.How big is Ellie?Ellie is 7.6 inches wide (193 mm), 9.33 inches tall (237 mm), and 3.7 inches deep (94 mm).What is Ellie’s retail price?$129.",61.0,2,"1 Campaign

When your day has Clair's clean air and sweet sounds, your day is perfect.            We announced the 3rd prototype of clair-S at the 2017 CES in Las Vegas. Many who visited our booth gave us compliments saying ""it feels like I'm in rainforest"", ""it keeps me feeling refreshed"", and ""this could really help my sleep"".  Sleep is how we recharge. Good sleep is crucial to improving brain function and preventing a host of health problems.  When we think of wellness, the three most important elements should be: diet, exercise, and sleep. Many people don’t realize that the air we breathe while we sleep is also tremendously important, and can have a major impact on our sleep quality. There is evidence that the air quality you breathe at night, plays an important role in your sleep quality.  The Harvard School of Public Health published a study that found air pollution to significantly increases the risk of having poor sleep. While air quality’s effect on sleep can often go unnoticed, noises are often the primary culprit for us waking up in the middle of the night. Although irritable noises like your neighbor’s barking dog or a partner’s snoring can keep you up at night, other soothing sounds like crashing waves or the soft hum of an air conditioner can lull you to sleep.  Certain sounds, including falling rain, can improve the actual quality of your sleep.       What if we developed an air purifier that helps you get a good night’s sleep? To do this, the device must both be quiet, and effectively provide purified air to breathe. To accomplish this, we developed our own proprietary air filtration technology named “e2f”. clair-S is more than just a standard air purifier with a HEPA filter. Its patented e2f filter goes beyond standard HEPA filter requirements, to even capture particulate matter 0.1 micrometers in size.       The clair-S air purifier operates on the principle of attracting polarized air-borne contaminants to the filter with a penetrating high polymer synthetic resin film. Highly effective in asthma and allergy care, it is capable of eliminating not only ultra-fine dust (as small as 0.1µm) but also allergens, pollen, mold, cigarette smoke, exhaust gasses and other unwanted particulate matter. Most personal air purifiers on the market are not designed to run continuously. Power consumption often ranges as high as 40W to 120W, making constant use impractical, and necessitating timers and noxious gas detectors which only add to the product’s price tag. However, Clair-S is designed to run continuously. Clair-S uses a maximum of 3 watts, costing you just a few cents a month, even as you enjoy its benefits continuously all day and night.        HEPA filter-based air purifiers require powerful fans to push air through a fine mesh to capture airborne particles. The finer the mesh, the more powerful a fan is needed. Clair-S works on completely different technology that efficiently captures airborne particles without needing a strong fan. Far less noise is generated.  Even on the highest settings, Clair air purifiers only maintain noise levels equal to a quiet library or a whisper in a quiet room.         You can control the Clair-S companion app by connecting through Bluetooth . Using the app, you can play natural sounds, white noise, and ambient music. This helps lull you into even deeper, more restful sleep. For fresh air and pleasant sleep, Clair S is the smart air purifier. Mix different soothing sounds together, to create your own custom audio mixes for relaxation, sleep, or concentration with our easy-to-use mobile app.Soothing sounds played through the equipped bluetooth speaker will bring positive therapeutic effects and deeper sleep, by masking unwanted frequencies with the sounds of nature, white noise, and soothing songs, promoting a more stable physical and mental state. Record a lullaby with your own voice. Clair-S will sing your child to sleep. Most people hate alarm clocks and are needlessly distressed by classic wake alarms. clair-S will pleasantly wake you each morning with a recording of the familiar voice of your loved one, your spouse, your kids, or even your own voice. You will start to love your mornings. The better you start your day, the better you’ll feel for the rest of the day. Whatever music sources your Bluetooth enabled smart device can access, clair-S can play.          clair-S is simple and easy to Use for everyone. Unlike HEPA filters, which must be replaced every few months due to unremovable dust accumulation, the e2f filter was designed for easy cleaning and replacement. The e2f filter lasts for a full 12 months, and cleaning is as simple as vacuuming the dust off the filter's top portion.(once every 3 months recommended)Clair-S can be used almost anywhere, but the ideal locations are small-medium sized rooms. It can also be used in larger rooms, such as an open office space. As long as the Clair-S is positioned relatively close to you in your work space, the benefits of having a personal air purifier can still improve the air you breathe. We refer to this area as the Clair zone. 
BEDROOM : The ideal placement of a Clair air purifier in the bedroom is right next to your bed. This ensures the air you breathe while your sleep is the first to be filtered. 
OFFICE : If you’re in an office all day, having an air purifier next to you on your desk is the perfect location. It’s close and highly effective. With a large model, the side or in the corner is a suggested. But with a Clair air purifier, your desk is the ideal spot, and will enhance the overall appearance of your office area. For the design elements we collaborated with The Korean Institute of Design Promotion. The process was highly collaborative with multiple conceptualizations, re-designs and testing before deciding upon a final design.     Clair received recognition for its outstanding design and was invited to the IF design exhibition in Hamburg. (June.13.2016 ~ July.18.2016) After several modifications, we have finalized the industrial design of clair-S that is ready to go into mass production.Since the 3rd prototype is ready, we have continued evaluating and improving its effectiveness. Before starting mass production we will continue working on optimization and mobile app development. Of course, safety testing and certification application are ongoing as well.                       Our team is comprised of talented and professional indoor air quality experts, engineers, and designers with enthusiasm for developing innovative products.   Please contact marketing@clair.kr with further questions or requests.Warranty One year from the date of manufacturer produce. If a defect exists, at its option Clair will repair the product at no charge. Though, users are responsible  for the shipping cost. However, any breakdowns or not function properly caused by customer, costs will be collected from the users.Filter replacement and MaintenanceChanging filters is breeze.

This positive pressure pushes out exhaled air from inside through two filtering air vents. Inflowing air passes through a KN95 filter to remove up to 95% of particulate matter from the inflowing air. This includes, but is not limited to, aerosol-transmitted pathogens, mist droplets, pollen, dust, soot, and pet dander. It's important to keep in mind that if infectious particles are caught in the filters, it is important to take precautions when replacing the filters to avoid contamination. Your BioVYZR will come with detailed instructions on how to safely replace and dispose of used filters.        We're able to execute this ambitious production timeline because we already have established material sourcing and manufacturing partners on the ground. Before pivoting to the BioVYZR, we were already in the process of manufacturing our own product lines. As of June 10, 2020, we're currently in the middle of production for our first batch.  Please be sure to check our update for the latest information.    PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The BioVYZR is an outer layer that protects against airborne hazards in our daily environments. When it comes to protecting against airborne hazards, it can provide better protection than face masks and KN95 respirators. Its proprietary design offers a 360-degree seal to shield your personal space on all sides. It also features a built-in air purifying system to filter out pathogens, allergens, and pollutants from the air you breathe. The BioVYZR a type of PPE known as a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (or PAPR).

<div>You read that right. We invented a micro-CPAP device that has no hoses, no cords, and no mask. We did it because too many people have sleep apnea, and too many of those don’t wear their CPAP masks. Who can blame them with those masks and hoses? But <b>we need your help</b> to get it out of the lab and into your hands. </div>
<div> </div>

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is typically caused by a blockage of the airway when the soft tissue in the rear of the throat collapses during sleep. Untreated, OSA causes a number of serious health problems, including high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, memory impairment, weight gain, and headaches. The standard treatment for OSA is what is known as “Continuous Positive Airway Pressure,” or CPAP. </span><br/><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">CPAP machines can mitigate this problem, but their poor design causes sleep apnea sufferers to give up on it: <b>80% of CPAP users stop using it within one year</b>. Airing intends to change that with a revolutionary design that will work as well as any other CPAP machine, and patients won't have to deal with cumbersome, uncomfortable masks.</span><br/> <p> </p> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434458660/g2lupxty91maxbgm0vg8.png"" src=""""/></span><br/> </p> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Another reason patients give up on the traditional CPAP masks is that they get dirty and need to be cleaned regularly. Not so with Airing. Each Airing device is designed for one night’s use only and is recyclable. As a result, every night you get a clean device with <b>no cleaning to do, ever</b>. Airing also liberates you from the “mess” of uncomfortable straps and the noisy hum that both come with other CPAP machines. </span><br/> </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Airing’s design is a combination of several inventions, chief of which are the micro-blowers originally intended for heat regulation for chips in computers. These micro-blowers are entirely contained within the Airing device, so there is no need for external air hoses. Each Airing device is battery operated, so no need for any power wires. <b>Just “plug” the comfortable buds into your nostrils and breathe all night long</b>.</span><br/> </p>

</div><div>CPAP masks have a hard time maintaining a perfect seal onto your face as you move during sleep. The sound of rushing air will wake up not only you but also your partner.

</div></div></div></div></div>","Though we may have reached our initial financial goal on Indiegogo, our mission is far from over. Every penny will accelerate the development of a working prototype, accelerate the necessary testing we will need to do, and ultimately accelerate manufacturing. The more money we raise through this Indiegogo campaign, the more resources we can deploy to speed this technology into the hands of the people who need it. 

For example, recently we were able to purchase a piece of equipment that will allow us to execute one portion of our micro-blower construction completely in-house. Read more about why this is so important.  Click here to read more.

 
We invite you to learn more below about the Airing technology and contribute what you can to make Airing happen. Informed and committed, we are all in this together!
 


 

  
 
 
You read that right. We invented a micro-CPAP device that has no hoses, no cords, and no mask. We did it because too many people have sleep apnea, and too many of those don’t wear their CPAP masks. Who can blame them with those masks and hoses? But we need your help to get it out of the lab and into your hands. 
 
  
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is typically caused by a blockage of the airway when the soft tissue in the rear of the throat collapses during sleep. Untreated, OSA causes a number of serious health problems, including high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, memory impairment, weight gain, and headaches. The standard treatment for OSA is what is known as “Continuous Positive Airway Pressure,” or CPAP. CPAP machines can mitigate this problem, but their poor design causes sleep apnea sufferers to give up on it: 80% of CPAP users stop using it within one year. Airing intends to change that with a revolutionary design that will work as well as any other CPAP machine, and patients won't have to deal with cumbersome, uncomfortable masks.       
 
 
 
 
  
Another reason patients give up on the traditional CPAP masks is that they get dirty and need to be cleaned regularly. Not so with Airing. Each Airing device is designed for one night’s use only and is recyclable. As a result, every night you get a clean device with no cleaning to do, ever. Airing also liberates you from the “mess” of uncomfortable straps and the noisy hum that both come with other CPAP machines.  
 
 
 
 
  
Airing’s design is a combination of several inventions, chief of which are the micro-blowers originally intended for heat regulation for chips in computers. These micro-blowers are entirely contained within the Airing device, so there is no need for external air hoses. Each Airing device is battery operated, so no need for any power wires. Just “plug” the comfortable buds into your nostrils and breathe all night long. 

 
 

CPAP masks have a hard time maintaining a perfect seal onto your face as you move during sleep. The sound of rushing air will wake up not only you but also your partner. The hoses used by CPAP masks drag on the end table and on the bed, causing sleep disruptions. But Airing creates a tight fit inside your nostrils with no hoses to catch on anything. Better yet, snoring is eliminated. 
Think about how liberated you could be with not just one good night's sleep, but hundreds of them. Think about health problems you will avoid. Think about the energy you will have. Think about how much more productive you will be at work, the potential car accidents you’ll avoid, even your golf handicap decreasing by 3 shots. In short, think about how liberated you will be when you start using Airing to manage your sleep apnea. 

 


 
 
 
 



 

 


 

 
 
  

 
 
 

The timing of the development of complex and innovative technologies is difficult to predict precisely. Delay in achieving one milestone affects the remaining development process.
 

 
If you are interested in writing about Airing, feel free to contact us at  contact@fundairing.com

 

 

 
 
Airing will use your money to accelerate the execution of our development plan. We will be able to expand our technical staff and get access to the equipment and materials critical to building a working prototype of our micro-blowers, which we can then test. The more we raise, the more resources we can deploy to speed this technology into the hands of the people who need it.
 
Technical Update 3/14/15: 
 
We are very close to having the first fully-constructed micro-blower subassemblies completed. Once we have them, we will begin testing their functionality.
 

To prepare for this testing, we have just completed a key, customized component of our test system. This component, called a device under test (DUT) test fixture, will eventually allow us to test the operational performance of the micro-blower technology we have been building.  Click to read more 
 
 
We love the idea of involving the people directly and indirectly impacted by sleep apnea in a communal effort to bring about this revolutionary product. We know what we need to do, and we need your support to do it. This is your chance to contribute directly to dealing with a major health issue that affects tens of millions of people. But you have to exercise your vote to change the world of sleep apnea. One at a time, collectively your contributions can be a powerful force in enabling us to realize the awesome potential of this technology.

<p>Our Story</p>
<p>My name is Jean-Sébastien &amp; that's me and my wife Sommer back when she could smile! Sommer has a very RARE Bone disease and she has been through so much in her young years. We are now in our early 30s and have been married for 12yrs...and she has spent 8 of our Anniversaries in the hospital. Sommer has had well over 25 major surgeries including hip replacements and spinal decompression surgeies, plus countless other medical procedures, and years of physical therapy. She is only 3ft 7 and as you can see I stand a bit taller at 6ft1! We try to live a normal life and don't ask for much nor do we need a lot to be happy. We are so blessed to have a home, which we work hard for and have been blessed to use our home to help others in need (Sommer is most happy when we are able to help others &amp; when are able to just enjoy each other's company). We also have loving friends and family who are helping us to get the word out. In the past few years Sommer is just now at a point where she is not in so much pain from her back and hip replacements. She works hard to exercise her muscles &amp; has learned to walk all over again! She is learning to enjoy herself &amp; live a better life! However, there is one surgery left to be done before we can start our family. Sommer's bone disease has attacked her jaw bones and is rapidly wearing them away. The bones in her Jaw and Mouth need to be stabilized as well as permanent dentures placed in her mouth as it has also worn away her teeth immensely. It's not just a cosmetic problem, all the nerves in her teeth are exposed and she has constant pain, headaches, problems eating, and a severe bone infection...because of the infection she cannot fight off any other germs that come her way and she stays sick constantly. We, along with her doctors, have tried for the last year and a half to get our medical insurance to cover the surgery but they will not do so because our insurance company does not possess the proper codes &amp; processing manner to process the surgery as anything other than a ""Dental surgery"" and they do not intend to implement a process to help us or anyone else. Even though Sommer stays constantly sick and under doctor's care because of the damage to her bone and teeth, and it is obvious it is caused by her Bone disease, they will not reconsider. She has lost a lot of teeth and is embarrassed to go out in public although she tries to put on a brave face and positive attitude. I have watched her go from my once outgoing wife to shy, sickly, and timid. We are still paying medical bills from previous surgeries and the dentists do not offer payment plans. We get barely get by every month with all of her medical bills and it would take years and years to save for what we need...years she does not have. If you can help in any way it would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>If this happens for her, I will see my sickly, weak, timid wife who doesn't go out anymore, go back to her wonderful, beautiful, outgoing self! She she can get back in action making people smile and helping others! She also sings, does a lot for the church,  and makes awesome sculptures..so she will be able to do that again and contribute to the world her talent! She had a beautiful smile...I can't wait to see her smile again! We will also be able to finally start a family since this will be one of the last surgeries she requires! If this does not happen, the bones will continue to deteriorate and she will stay constantly sick, eventually lose her ability to have any kind of implants, lose the ability to chew, or even speak. Sommer will still find a way to smile and make me smile but she will it will be hard living with constant medical problems and not being able to have a family...something we would love so dearly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>The longer we wait, the worse the condition and the more expensive it gets to fix. It is already become worse while waiting on the insurance. Right now the surgeons want half of the surgical amount of $20,000 which is of course $10,000. Then the prosthetic denture has an added cost of $25,000 and we are not sure yet about what our payment options for the prosthetic will be, if any at all. If we are able to raise the money we need, we will blog our process, take pics and inform you of every step of her journey! With your help, I can bring so much joy and life back to my beautiful wife!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Please pass this along to anyone you think could spare even a dollar! You can really change her life! You have no idea how much joy and happiness you will bring to her, her family, and me! You can always offer words of encouragement to her as well in the comment section because that in itself means a lot! Thank you so much!</p></div>","Our Story

The bones in her Jaw and Mouth need to be stabilized as well as permanent dentures placed in her mouth as it has also worn away her teeth immensely. It's not just a cosmetic problem, all the nerves in her teeth are exposed and she has constant pain, headaches, problems eating, and a severe bone infection...because of the infection she cannot fight off any other germs that come her way and she stays sick constantly. We, along with her doctors, have tried for the last year and a half to get our medical insurance to cover the surgery but they will not do so because our insurance company does not possess the proper codes & processing manner to process the surgery as anything other than a ""Dental surgery"" and they do not intend to implement a process to help us or anyone else. Even though Sommer stays constantly sick and under doctor's care because of the damage to her bone and teeth, and it is obvious it is caused by her Bone disease, they will not reconsider. She has lost a lot of teeth and is embarrassed to go out in public although she tries to put on a brave face and positive attitude. I have watched her go from my once outgoing wife to shy, sickly, and timid. We are still paying medical bills from previous surgeries and the dentists do not offer payment plans. We get barely get by every month with all of her medical bills and it would take years and years to save for what we need...years she does not have. If you can help in any way it would be greatly appreciated!
 
The Impact
If this happens for her, I will see my sickly, weak, timid wife who doesn't go out anymore, go back to her wonderful, beautiful, outgoing self! She she can get back in action making people smile and helping others! She also sings, does a lot for the church,  and makes awesome sculptures..so she will be able to do that again and contribute to the world her talent! She had a beautiful smile...I can't wait to see her smile again! We will also be able to finally start a family since this will be one of the last surgeries she requires! If this does not happen, the bones will continue to deteriorate and she will stay constantly sick, eventually lose her ability to have any kind of implants, lose the ability to chew, or even speak. Sommer will still find a way to smile and make me smile but she will it will be hard living with constant medical problems and not being able to have a family...something we would love so dearly.
 
What We Need & What You Get
The longer we wait, the worse the condition and the more expensive it gets to fix. It is already become worse while waiting on the insurance. Right now the surgeons want half of the surgical amount of $20,000 which is of course $10,000. Then the prosthetic denture has an added cost of $25,000 and we are not sure yet about what our payment options for the prosthetic will be, if any at all. If we are able to raise the money we need, we will blog our process, take pics and inform you of every step of her journey! With your help, I can bring so much joy and life back to my beautiful wife!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Please pass this along to anyone you think could spare even a dollar! You can really change her life! You have no idea how much joy and happiness you will bring to her, her family, and me! You can always offer words of encouragement to her as well in the comment section because that in itself means a lot! Thank you so much!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>""Everyone assumes that hearing you’ve got cancer will be the worst moment of your life. You’ve seen the adverts where there’s a load of sad people staring into the camera with tears in their eyes and sad expressions on their faces like they’ve realized that unicorns don’t actually exist. And they get chucked into breaks when you’re trying to relax with a few biscuits of an evening making you listen to how one in three people have this horrible disease. That’s enough to ruin anyone’s Emmedale""</p>
<h3>Cancer is a mother bitch and if you have it, you don’t really know what to do with yourself. I want to show people the reality of cancer and how it affects or will affect them, their family, their friends, their cat and their unicorn.</h3>
<p>My name is Effi Mai and I have a company called ForrReal. After being diagnosed with Cancer at seventeen I decided to do something for others. So five years later I told people I have the disease and here I am. I’ve had two types of the shitty thing myself, breast and cervical, which I’m sure is the universe’s way of telling me to stop having sex. If I get mouth cancer, I’ll really know. So what was I saying? Yes so still have the cervical stuff currently so now it’s time to share the knowledge and love and possibly prevent other girls from going through this.</p>
<h3>So this is how we do it.</h3>
<p><br/> ForrReal is a few things.  First, it is an advice website for every woman. When I came out of the cancer closet my inbox started to fill with questions, inquiries, pictures of inspiring cats and all other fancy bits. I try and answer every email in detail, with dialogue, with humour (if sometimes a tad inappropriate) and all the positive princess love I can give.  Anything from what to eat to stop feeling nauseous to what wig is best to French braid. These questions and answers will all go public on the brand spanking new website.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is to let everyone know the real stuff about cancer. The effects of everything from beginning to end, the things that doctors don’t have the time to tell you and the stuff that will happen. How to check your breasts, how a lump feels, how not to panic and how to cope with having to tell your loved ones are just tiny examples.</p>
<p>If you start having chemo you might expect to feel sick, but you probably won’t expect to have a nosebleed while you’re wearing a white dress. If you’re put on pills to stop the hair loss you won’t expect to feel high and want to tell strangers on the tube that you love them. All in a cancer day. I want to put all the articles I have written into a book in due course once the company grows.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly, which is my biggest challenge, is that I want to get the age of which a woman has a cervical screening test down to the age of eighteen and to have a smear every two years.</strong> Living in Wales at the time, I was lucky enough to get a screening done at twenty years old and they caught it at stage two. Currently in England you have to be twenty-five before you even get a letter telling you should possibly maybe slightly think about going to get a smear test. And then you have to wait five years before you get another one. Cervical cancer can be cured if it is caught early and this just isn’t happening in the UK.  </p>
<p>**The LESBIAN add on to part three. If you are a lesbian, you can get cervical cancer. You don’t have to sleep with a penis to get it. You don’t have to do rude things in the back of mini with that penis either. You can get cervical cancer, gay or straight. Look at me for example, gold star lesbian, never slept with said penis and bam! It got me in the vagina.</p>
<h3>Spread your legs and spread the word</h3>
<p>It’s a company where there’s a community and there’s women and girls who can join together each knowing what the others are going through.</p>
<h3>What we need from you princess faces</h3>
<p>What I need for you is money for funding of the actual company ForrReal, and money for Effi and team to live on while we do it. Effi likes talking about herself in the third person and should do it more often.</p>
<p>I work from home on a magazine and newspaper that I plan to connect this company to. Also, when you're throwing up throughout the day it's difficult to maintain a proffessional outlook in an office environment.  I work on this every spare minute I have. I’ll even miss Pretty Little Liars in order to work on it. That’s dedication of the highest order in my world.</p>
<p>I also have a small team working with me so we can run the campaign and run the website smoothly, and they don’t really ask for much for working their bums off for this company. Just a slice of pizza and a shot of tequila now and then.</p>
<p>We need your help to keep things running, especially through the next few crucial months of our growth.

We don’t want to be another boring talk either, we want to make women laugh and we want to tell them everything they need to know.</p>
<p>- Flyers and brochures designed, printed out and spread around the place<br/>- Money to travel on the trains to get to places to talk<br/>- Advertising in magazines, on websites and on posters to raise as much awareness as possible and to help us with our campaign to take it to the government.</p>

HealthID is changing the way medical information is managed and communicated. Currently consumers that take prescription medications, have a chronic illness (i.e. diabetes) or general medical conditions have no simple mobile solution with management capabilities, medication reminders, ability to share information with doctors or others and then have that critical up-to-date information available for a first responder in a medical emergency; and we use NFC technology as a simple and cost effective solution for immediate management and communication. NO SPECIAL APP needed to view the medical emergency summary, just a tap from a NFC smartphone. Users of our products can download our app to quickly access their HealthID Profile and manage any/all aspects of their medical situation (ex. Change/update medication(s), enter a glucose level or insulin dosage or change a phone number to an emergency contact)...ALL UPDATES OR CHANGES WILL BE IMMEDIATELY VIEWABLE FROM THE HEALTHID BAND OR CARD!

Emergency Communication

A first responder can immediately view your up-to-date medical information in a medical emergency with a simple “tap” from an NFC Smartphone. Your information can be communicated in seconds...and every second counts can help save lives!




Medication Adherence

Quickly add your prescription medication(s) to your HealthID profile. Then set-up reminders by text, email or mobile app to take them! This will help assure that you take your medication as prescribed.



Medical Condition & Chronic Disease Management

Any medical condition can be managed from our Mobile App; or access your profile from any pc or laptop. Update basic profile information, any medical condition, medications, emergency contacts that can be quickly dialed from the emergency summary screen, to managing chronic illness such as diabetes with glucose entry and trend charting. MRI’s, EKG’s, X-Rays and lab results can also be uploaded and stored in your profile. All information is stored securely on our cloud based platform and allows for easy access to your account to manage or share any aspect of your personal healthcare.


 

Ability to Share

A simple way to share your information with your doctors, family or support community, all while on the go with our mobile application. 
 



No NFC? No Problem



Your critical information can still be accessed in seconds without an NFC smartphone. Simply enter the wearers unique HIP Code (located on each of our products) at healthid.com from ANY INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICE whether a PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone.
 
 

  

How it works

 
HealthID’s technology activates with a simple tap from an NFC smartphone. Your information is stored securely in our cloud-based servers. None of your information is stored on our products locally, so when an NFC smartphone taps your band or card it gives the instruction to retrieve your specific information from the cloud and display it on the smartphone’s screen so it can be quickly viewed.

 
Manage Multiple HIP Products

We have designed HealthID so that you can add and remove multiple products to your profile...all from the mobile app or web based application. If you lose one, you can simply remove that product (HIP Code) from your profile for security. So add all the HealthID Band colors and the HealthID Card to your profile, then have ability to add any future HealthID products...because we are always thinking of new things!

He's a humble guy, incredibly smart, funny, and would give anyone in need the shirt off his back. He's a lot like how our Mom and Dad were when they were alive. Always giving, never taking.  But Marvin was suddenly in a position needing help, and since then, despite he's had several close-calls with the cancer, he's managed to bounce back. The Energizer Bunny doesn't have nuthin on good ole Marvin! But  it's not been easy, especially on my Sister who is closer to the emotional ups and downs this cancer brings. She's right there with him when Marvin's cancer turns for the worst, and I get choked up with tears just thinking of each time she phoned or messaged with grim news. But my brother keeps bouncing back each time. A lot of it is due to the amazing doctors and nurses who are tough yet caring with Marvin, and a whole whole lot is due to the love and care of friends and family who have stepped up to be there (especially my Sister and Brother-in-Law!).  Cousins helping my Sister take Marvin to his treatments, Friends and Coworkers doing the same so my Sister and her Husband could work their demanding full time jobs whilst my Sister also completed her college courses. And then also is our amazing Aunt who invites Marvin to come live with her at times so she could enjoy his company. <br/><br/>There have been a lot of hospital emergencies, chemotherapies, urgent surgeries, and loads of prescriptions as well as medical supplies. <br/><br/>Marvin has absolutely no medical insurance to cover any of the costs. He had COBRA for awhile after having to leave his much-loved job due to his condition, and we're told Medicare will kick in starting January 2015 (in 2 years!).  Marvin is an Army Veteran, but, unfortunately, he was enlisted during the years Veterans were not given benefits. My Sister and her Husband have been footing the bill these years, paying out of pocket this entire time and not asking for any help other than trying to get Marvin the benefits he should have, but battling paperwork and red tape to get.  But now it's gotten really rough with more prescriptions needed after a recent urgent surgery to remove some of the cancer, that, thankfully, Marvin has bounced back yet again from.  <br/>Today my Sister sent an SOS and our family huddled together to all chip in what little we can to cover the immediate prescriptions and bills for this month. Now we're trying to sort out how to pay for Marvin's next procedure coming up in a weeks time!  As well his monthly oncology visit is in a months time, but the finance office put a block on Marvin at the check in desk saying the visit has to be paid in cash for him to be seen. <br/><br/>I put this donation page together hoping to reach everyone who knew and knows Marvin, because if you met him once, he's such a nice guy you don't forget him.  I was blessed to have recently stayed a week with him after living out of the country for the past 6 years, and it was one of the best weeks I'll always remember, as will my kids. They managed to pick up their Uncle Marvin's dry sense of humor so I'm reminded often of him when my children crack the same jokes :)  <br/><br/>If you know Marvin or happen to read this and can feel for his situation, please know that his entire Family thank you already with the biggest hugs.  Comeraderie and Compassion mean more than anything in any dire situation, especially Marvin's. If you would like to donate to help with the medical bills, please know it's greatly needed and so much appreciated.  Hopefully when Medicare kicks in it will ease this burden. <br/><br/>Take a look at what you get for your donation as well. We don't have money but we can give in return with creativity and talent you can appreciate.  The perks offered cannot be purchased anywhere.

My name is Heather Scott and I’m the founder of Purple Plant Smoothies. I started this company in San Francisco in the spring of 2011 as a way to help educate people on the benefits of eating fresh, local whole foods. I recently started to see a trend where way too many people aren’t eating their greens and fresh fruits regularly. This is usually what leads to snacking on not so healthy foods and sweets during the day and late into the night.
That said, I decided to create an affordable, tasty and convenient way to help people eat healthier.  In doing so, I made a commitment to Purple Plant Smoothie drinkers that our smoothies are 100% pesticide free and are made with nothing more than 100% pure fruits, veggies and roots.
As a former Division I Cross Country and Track runner, I've had a strong passion for good health throughout my life. I became an NASM CPT in 2010, in order to start helping people on their paths to becoming healthier through exercise. However, I quickly realized that exercise alone doesn’t make someone healthier overall. Proper nutrition is a necessary component. 

I had THOUGHT I was really healthy, since I would run a lot and work out every day. I was also eating pretty healthy...or so I thought... Interestingly, even as health conscious as I was, I still wasn’t eating greens (spinach, kale, chard), whole fruits (berries, oranges, bananas and apples) and roots (ginger and beets) regularly.
Eating greens regularly has really improved my quality of life. Drinking these smoothies every morning has made me more alive and full of energy, I feel stronger during my runs, my skin clears, I am not as sick as I used to be and I  maintain a healthy weight with moderate exercise.
I'm so excited to be able to make Purple Plant Smoothies for others as a way for them to also get the proper nutrition they need to be healthier, too!


The Impact

This campaign is very important to us, as we'd really love to grow and be able to reach even more people than we are currently. In the winter months it's tough to be out on the cart without any protective covering. We also need to be able to hire some more people to help, so we can increase the amount of farmer's markets we're in.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Chainey. About a year and a half ago my gums got infected, and due to lack of healthcare and rising costs it went untreated and turned into gum disease, which exponentially brakes down my teeth causing them to break and fall off, along with very powerful pain. I haven't been able to chew in about six months, limited to very soft or liquid food. The procedure to cut out the remaining roots and extract the remaining teeth along with replacing them with new teeth costs roughly $7,000. But, since I'm a 21 year old female with hardly any teeth, it's very hard to find work. </p>

What can I do to reduce my stress in parenting?""Holistically,"" in this sense, means taking into account all aspects of the human condition: Body, Mind, Spirit, and Heart (Emotion). If we ""live in our heads"" most of the time, it follows that our body, our spirit, and our emotions could become negatively affected, and we can't access parts of ourselves that could help us bounce back from stressors. I have been a holistic healing practitioner and meditation coach since the early 1990's. I've organized several international workshops and a conference on children's health--led by myself and other presenters. You can read more about these as you scroll down.  The goal of this campaign is to secure the funds necessary to self-publish the handbook's first printing, to gain a wider audience to share what I have learned in the past twenty years, with a wider audience. I thought that crowdfunding, accumulating small donations of $5 to $10, would be a great way to accomplish this. If this is the first time you have landed on this campaign, please check the updates! There are testimonials if you click on ""See More"".I have a video clip there which has some great information of interest to parents with kids on the autism spectrum.The book is all about offering strategies many people may not yet know about, to navigate our lives with more ease and grace.  It is all the more important for parents. Parents can feel at times like they have the  toughest job in the world ( “a handful and a heartful,” as the saying goes.) The 21st century has its own set of challenges, not the least of which is the extent to which electronics have taken over our lives, and that daily life does not have the rhythm it once had with everything being “on,” 24/7. For instance, does anyone know the long-term side effects, when a parent or a nanny gives a toddler in a stroller an I-pad to play with, for short-term amusement, rather than engaging with the child one-on-one?The harmful side effects of the electromagnetic radiation from screens for children's developing brains  is now well-documented. But are today's kids missing out on something we used to take for granted?
If any funds are left over after the $1600 goal is reached (or equivalent in euros, Swiss francs, etc) they will be used for additional promotion, through the publisher or for expenses related to providing the perks to my Indiegogo contributors.
If the goal is not reached within the 40 days, the amount we do raise will go toward a payment plan with the publisher, Balboa Press.

If you would share on your own social networks, that would be  great. Thank you so much in advance!  And--please ""like"" my Facebook page of the same name, and help me reach 100 ""likes"" or more!
I decided that this book had to be written, because I wasn’t able to find a handbook that  addressed these subjects in an easy- to -use format, to refer to while on the go. Many of my holistic practice clients were looking for answers. Other holistic practitioners may already know a lot of these strategies, but my feeling is that even they will find out something new here!

I don’t enjoy prolonged time on the computer wading through articles. I figured there were hundreds of people who probably felt the same way. I’ve done the legwork here, so you don’t have to! It is gleaned  largely from my own personal experience, trainings, and professional holistic practice of twenty-one years and counting.

There has been an explosion in the wellness industry, but not all internet information is reliable. I was also talking to people, even to 20-somethings, who did not even know that there were alternatives to antidepressants, which are particularly in widespread use in America. Similarly, there are people worldwide who do not understand why so many American school personnel choose to drug their students (in the millions) who exhibit behavior challenges without getting to the root cause!

I have treated clients from the age of 17 months to 86 years. I have also been an art teacher, in several venues, and privately, working with children and teens of all ages. I have learned a lot about child development as a result. As a support person in the special needs departments of  public schools-- for children with behavior and attention challenges (many of whom were refugees), I saw first hand what was lacking in some cases, and what was working in others. Children suffer from stress-related circumstances, just as adults do. I had the great opportunity to work in  two pioneering magnet schools in Burlington, Vermont: The Sustainability Academy at Lawrence Barnes, and the Integrated Arts Academy (the IAA, formerly Wheeler Elementary).

The first content contained in the  book was originally written with a focus on finding natural, non-pharmaceutical solutions for challenges faced by parents of children and teens who were labeled with ADD/ADHD and autism. Later, new sections were added to assist anybody, of any age, to manage their stress, through body/mind/spirit/heart-centered strategies and therapies of all kinds,for parents and non-parents alike.

I’ve written several articles for each of these American publications:""South Burlington Life,"" ""EverChanging"" (both in the State of Vermont) and ""Sedona Journal of Emergence"" from Arizona. The latter is a well-respected monthly magazine containing articles on human potential and spiritual growth.

In 1995, I founded the Waterfront Holistic Healing Center in Burlington, Vermont with a colleague.I went on to manage it for seven years, and I worked with a total of 17 other practitioners. I had the idea to start a local television talk show, with interviews with professional, established practitioners, both from inside and outside the Center,  to get the word out to more people. It started out as “Earth Healing Outreach” on Adelphia Cable 15 in the late 1990’s. It  later evolved into “Holistically Speaking TV” in March 2012 at VCAM (Vermont Community Access Media) . I originally produced it, and Lisa Bridge interviewed. Now, both functions have been taken over by Morella Devost, and she has done a stellar job. We have produced more than 100 episodes, and several of them are viewable on our YouTube channel, “holisticallyspeakingtv.”I have links throughout the book to some of these.

Balboa Press (www.balboapress.com) is  the self-publishing arm of Hay House (www.hayhouse.com), one of the biggest publishers in the world of holistic, self-help books. Maybe some of you have read Louise Hay’s book, “You Can Heal Your Life,” or attended one of the webinars by the many well-known figures in the world of alternative medicine and wellness. Balboa, with the publishing package, will do the editing, layout, promotion, and on-demand printing for me. The book will be available through Amazon and www.barnesandnoble.com, most probably in January 2016. It takes four months from my submission of the manuscript.

Again, thanks in advance for any  contribution, no matter how small, and I hope together that we can create a great community in the process!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>On August 12th I woke feeling strange. Whenever I tried to sit up it felt like my head was made of lead and that the world was spinning, it took several attempts before I was able to get out of bed. I assumed I was just overly tired from staying up late and told myself to stop being dramatic and go to work. I drank a glass of milk to settle my queezey stomach and walked to work. Upon reaching work I spoke to my manager about finding someone else to work for me and that if we could reach someone I would head home when they arrived. She agreed and I turned to go clock in and immediately found myself on the ground with a coworker standing above me. He drove me home and that day I went to the emergency clinic where they tested my blood sugar levels. <br/><br/>I was sitting at a 56. <br/><br/>Now I had no idea what that meant and I'm assuming most people are like me and know little to nothing about what is normal for a human when it comes to blood sugar. The doctor informed me I should be anywhere from 80 to 110. Needless to say, I was very low. After bringing my blood sugar back up I still wasn't feeling well. I couldn't stand without help and couldn't move my head around without getting dizzy. I was diagnosed with a sinus infection and was told I was a <b>hypoglycemic and possibly anemic. </b><br/><br/>He wanted follow up his assumption with blood work...but given the clinic visit itself was $75 and that I had lost at least one days wage I could not afford the $200 it would be for blood work. He understood, gave my a prescription to fight off my infection ($85 worth of medication) and sent me on my way. He did not give me any information to fight off the hypoglycemia he had unofficially diagnosed me with. <br/><br/>I ended up bed ridden and could not return to work for a week.<br/><br/><i>Flashforward to now. (TL;DR)</i><br/><br/>I've been living my life under the assumption that I am, indeed a hypoglycemic. All of the reading I've done (from various sources on the internet and E-Books) I seem to have all of the correct symtopms. I've been adjusting my diet accordingly....but the problem is:<br/><br/></p>
<h4>I'm not getting better.</h4>
<br/>I seem to slowly be getting worse. I've had to loose several shifts at work because I simply cannot walk in a straight line let alone preform the job I'm being payed for. <br/><br/>I am now begining to susspect that I cannot carry on the way I am.

Why wait until now?

The simple answer is what is always is: MONEY.


My Father was supposed to be receiving insurance in a few months and I was going to push through and just wait it out until then. But now my Father has returned to being unemployed and I have no hope for health insurance in sight, nor do I feel as though I can ask my parents for help given that my mother struggles to feed four people on her wage. I had also just payed for my school tuition without any help from grants or finical aid. I'm now left sitting here wondering if I should take another year off of school and drop out of my classes so I could use the refunded money for medical bills. What is Hypoglycemia and how does it effect a person's life?
According to Wikipedia: ""Hypoglycemia (...) is a medical emergency that involves an abnormally diminished content of glucose in the blood. The term literally means ""low blood sugar""  It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects but the principal problems arise from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain, resulting in impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage or death.""
As I understand it:My body is no longer able to accept the intake of sugars because when I introduce sugar into my body, say 39 grams which is found in a can of Coca-Cola. My body then produces enough insulin to take out 39 grams of sugar and THEN some, which ends up lowing the natural levels of sugar my blood is supposed to have. 
This leaves me crashing and my most common symtomps are currently:
Dizziness
Trouble Speaking

Trouble concentrating

Irritability

Heart palpitations

Shakiness
Heavy sweating
Numbness in my legs and feet
Stomach pains
Depression,
Sudden crying

Memory loss

<p>My
name is Hicham and I am a passionate runner who has both run marathons and
volunteered at water stops. I started Water Baton in 2013 to design a unique
concept to satisfy the hydration needs of runners and other athletes. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The
Purpose</b></p>
<p>WATER
BATON™ was created to solve a problem that millions of runners and I experience
in this sport. We runners are not able to effectively and quickly hydrate at
water stops. </p>
<p>We
get splashed in the face, sometimes gag and are left with little to
drink out of cups distributed at the water stops. Sometimes runners
have to completely stop to be able to grab a cup and drink. We not only
lose precious seconds attempting to get the water cups but we are also not able
to just grab them and go: water spills out of the cups.  What a waste of
time and water!  </p>
<p>In
an effort to correct this, I've conceived the idea of a WATER BATON™. </p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What
is WATER BATON™?</b></p>
<p>In
the format of a relay baton, WATER BATON™ is a light, recyclable beverage
container, with an EASY GRIP to grab and go, filled with just enough water
to quench the thirst of an athlete. </p>
<p>A
water bottle is too heavy and bulky; water cups are not practical to handle and
hold while running, so WATER BATON™ comes in handy to runners. Made of PP
plastic, the container is BPA-free and can be reused if not damaged or broken.</p>
<p>It
can be used by runners, triathlon competitors, swimmers, walkers and other
athletes.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why
is WATER BATON™ different than any other water bottle?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>WATER
BATON™ was designed especially for water stops, races and athletes who do not
like to carry too much water but would like to have enough water to hydrate. The
container holds approximately 4 fl oz and is easy to secure in any running
belt, waist band, arm band, or simply in ones hands.</p>

<h3><strong>Why you need Surefire Wellness' Vitality Greens Superfood</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Let's be honest, we are not eating the daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables; even if we are, we are missing out on so many ""superfoods"" with their incredible benefits! Many foods today are loaded with chemicals. Chemicals stemming from the soil and/or preservatives which aid the foods growth. These chemicals, processed sugar and other artificial sweeteners are very toxic and are highly acidic foods. High acidity levels inhibit our bodies from performing at optimum levels and make you feel more sluggish and more prone to disease! Our drink will help alkalize your body and remove toxins to increase nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Ingesting whole foods is quite different than ingesting from isolated vitamin capsules. Our green drink, with all whole foods, has a synergistic effect, complementing and boosting how the body can effectively absorb and use the nutrients. </p>
<p><strong>Surefire Wellness' Vitality Greens Superfood will help the digestive system, nervous system, respiratory system, endocrine system, urinary system, musculoskeletal system, exocrine system (skin-biggest organ of your body), immune and reproductive systems! </strong></p>

<p>Andy was one of the few truly decent people left in the world. He was always there for the ones he loved to lend a helping hand or a sympathetic ear. Despite all of the hardships he faced for so long, he never let it break his spirit. Ten years have passed since the day he lost his long battle with lymphoma. It is time we honor him in the way that he deserves. Please help support us in creating a memorial bench in his honor. The majority of the funds raised will be used to build a new bench overlooking the duck pond in Johnson Park. An additional amount will be allocated to create a beautiful memorial plaque to be attached to the bench. The remaining funds will be used to reserve a picnic grove and for supplies to be used at the memorial event in August. Time is of the essence. We need to raise the funds in enough time to reserve the grove and create the bench prior to the 10 year anniversary of his passing which is in August.

<h3>So Here Is My Story:</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Judy and my Dad passed away in May of 2012. My elderly Mom suffers from Mid Stage Dementia and Type 1 Diabetes. Without Dad there to care for her, my Mom was faced with having to leave the comfort of her own home and go to the ""dreaded"" Nursing Home. I made the decision to sacrifice everything for my Mom. I moved to Kentucky to become my Mom's 24/7 caregiver. I am unable to get a job due to the comittment I have made. I receive no compensation.  Therefore, I have no way to make any money unless I make it from home. I love to crochet with yarn that is handspun from fiber and natural wools. I have been using a hand Drop Spindle to spin my yarn. However, I was diagnosed with Juvenile Rhuematoid Arthritus at the age of 12. My hands are becoming more and more painful. If I could raise enough to buy a Spinning Wheel my hands wouldn't be as involved. I would then be able to make enough handspun yarn to sell for a small profit so that I can feel more accomplished and have a little pocket money. Most importantly, this will allow me to help Mom stay in her own home. </p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what can make it possible for me to keep Mom home:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>She's my Mom and I love her dearly... I have to try.</p>

<li>I can't continue to care for her without an income.</li>

Gaberila and her mother were at John's Hopkins University Hospital and Gaberila is scheduled to start a modified Atkins diet for seizure control, similar to a ketogenic diet, they will use food to control her seizures. But first, she needs to stabilize, and then slowly get off of her current medications. She is currently in Santa Barbara CA at Sanctuary Psychiatric Center, a non-profit 24 hour facility that will work with Johns Hopkins to treat Gaberila's Epilepsy and Schizoaffective Disorder caused by the pharmaceuticals.

<h2><strong><strong><span>How you can help and how your contributions will be used</span></strong></strong></h2>
<p>We have successfully tested the working prototypes which you see in the pictures and videos. Everyone who has tried Gorilla Gym loves it: not only family and friends but also total strangers at the Harvard Square Octoberfest. Next, we will finalize the colors, file expanded legal  paperwork, and generally get ramped up for production. Your contributions will help put the project across the finish line, help the production process preparations, and help fund our first production run. The more funding raised, the more funders will be the first able to get their hands on Gorilla Gym in early 2013 at a special discounted price just in time to keep all those New Year’s Resolutions!</p>

<h3><strong><strong><span>Your Doorway – One of the Strongest Structures In Your House</span><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<p>The old saying: “in an earthquake, the safest place in your house is under your doorway.” comes from the fact that your doorways are framed on all sides by sturdy 2 by 4s which can support hundreds of pounds.  </p>
<h3><strong><strong>Self-Adjusting Cantilevered Design Supports Up and Down Motion</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Part of our design is cantilevered just like the old-school pullup bars which easily attach to a doorframe and are able to support up and down motion by transferring the force to the wall above the door frame and to the side of the door frame.  See figure below:<strong><strong><br/><img alt=""How Gorilla Gym Works (Pullups)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gorilla-gym.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/How-It-Works-Vertical-Forces.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></strong></strong>Traditional cantilevered pullup bars, however, are not designed to support motion (swinging back-and-forth or sideways). This is where Gorilla GymTM comes in!</p>
<h3><strong><strong><span>Our Patent-Pending Vise Grips Secure Gorilla Gym To Your Doorframe</span></strong></strong></h3>

How it works
(Disclaimer: The descriptions below are for information purposes only)
Your Doorway – One of the Strongest Structures In Your House
The old saying: “in an earthquake, the safest place in your house is under your doorway.” comes from the fact that your doorways are framed on all sides by sturdy 2 by 4s which can support hundreds of pounds.  
Self-Adjusting Cantilevered Design Supports Up and Down Motion
Part of our design is cantilevered just like the old-school pullup bars which easily attach to a doorframe and are able to support up and down motion by transferring the force to the wall above the door frame and to the side of the door frame.  See figure below:Traditional cantilevered pullup bars, however, are not designed to support motion (swinging back-and-forth or sideways). This is where Gorilla GymTM comes in!
Our Patent-Pending Vise Grips Secure Gorilla Gym To Your Doorframe
Swinging motion or the forces that result from using an attachment like a boxing bag introduce lateral (across the wall) and longitudinal (along the side of the wall) motion. The Gorilla Gym Vise Grips are designed to counteract these forces and keep Gorilla Gym secured to the door frames on each side.

We'd like to extend our reach to support youth in our local community.</p>
<p>Oolagen is an organization that helps youth and their families cope with mental illness. They provide a variety of services, but our favourite is their FREE walk-in clinic, located at Church &amp; Wellesley in downtown Toronto. Teenagers from 13-18 years old and their families can either walk in or make appointments to see a counselor and receive assistance for their mental health concerns. And that's right - it's free. They provide an amazing service and they need our help to keep it up and make it even better. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p>We want to host a benefit in order to raise funds for Oolagen in April 2015. The date that we are planning for right now is Friday April 10th in the evening. It will be located in the Junior Common Room in University College.</p>
<p>The benefit will largely be a dance party with a more ""sophisticated"" cocktail period beforehand. We hope that older members of the community will join us at that time in order to participate in a silent auction, donate, and grab some food. Our broad theme is ""comfort"" - things that make you feel good and increase your mental health. Appetizers and desserts will be served to fit in with this theme as ""comfort food"". There will be a cash bar. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that big parties, loud music and drinks make some people nervous - that's why we will have another small room open for people to take breaks and chat with their friends. We want to make this an enjoyable experience for everyone and a great way to end the school year, so we're open to suggestions. </p>
<p>In addition to selling tickets, we want to raise money in other ways too - we'd like to have a silent auction featuring art pieces by students (preferably mental health inspired) and other donated items. We hope to feature students' work inspired by mental health in this way, or through short performances and displays. There will be a photographer present who will take great photos for you guys. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/>We receive very little funding from the University of Toronto - what money we do receive is needed to keep Active Minds at UofT running during the school year.

This is because we want as many people as possible to be able to be a part of our community.</p>
<p>In order to put on this benefit in the first place, we need to raise some money to pay for things like:</p>
<p>-Food (~$500). We will be serving a variety of appetizers and desserts that tie into our mental health theme as ""comfort food"". It doesn't sound like much, but food for 100+ people adds up.<br/>-Bar (~$400).

Little things add up too.</p>
<p><br/>We will also be trying to raise money during the year as well by selling merch, having bake sales, etc. We will be selling tickets starting in the spring - they will be $10 in advance and $15 at the door. <br/><br/>For every $10 you donate, you will receive a ticket to the benefit. For example, donating $20 can get you a ticket for yourself and a date. <br/><br/>If you don't want multiple tickets, but still want to donate more - thank you so much! You can choose from alternative perks as well. If you're not coming to the benefit, but still want to donate - again, thank you so much! We've got perks for you as well. Our favourite perk is also a little bit unconventional, so we just wanted to take a sec to explain it:<br/><br/><i>$5 - 1 song. Our cheapest perk is actually our favourite, and we think you'll love it too. If you donate at least $5, you get to pick a song that will be played at some point during the benefit, guaranteed. No need to pester the DJ with requests or be disappointed - it's happening. (As long as it's not offensive.) You can purchase your ticket later if you want, or request a song for that special someone in your life.<br/>50 available.</i><br/><br/></p>
<p>The restrictions on this one are based on time. All other perk ""packages"" that include songs will be subject to the limitation of 50 as well. </p>

<h3><strong>Not just another Online Fitness Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Online fitness is not something new or revolutionary, so what makes us different?</p>
<p><br/>Our focus is different; we propose the platform with tools for the fitness instructor to freely teach online and decide on his sessions' commercialization options. The platform will allow the instructor to build his community of followers and grow his business.</p>
<p>We base ourselves on the existing instructor's app, with more than 8.000 instructors registered and growing. Most instructors are eager to propose live and recorded paying sessions. The reality is that the majority of instructors got their fitness revenue streams reduced down to zero.<br/>Today, no platform allows instructors to commercialize their work freely and propose it to a large fitness enthusiast community. </p>
<p>We often use the word community, what does it mean for us, and why is it different from other platforms? </p>
<p>Although fitness is a general term, there are many fitness bubbles or communities, usually depending on the program type. These bubbles can combine fitness brands or types, countries, and languages.</p>
<p>We created this new concept of a dynamic fitness community. Any user, instructor, or enthusiast identifies his/her fitness preferences, country, and language; this results in dynamic groups that will grow over time.</p>
<p>These dynamic communities will be used for instructors to propose their content adapted to a dynamic community, touching enthusiasts they could not reach before.</p>
<p>Fitness enthusiasts will discover instructors that provide content to their preferred community, they will evaluate the content, and by default, the best content will rise from the crowd.</p>
<p>Overall, this technique will improve the general quality of the content, just like Uber enhances cab service quality due to the end-user evaluations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>So, coming to the funding.</p>
<p>We need financial support from backers like you and we need it with some sense of urgency. To capitalize on the aftermath of this pandemic, which presents a great business opportunity for apps like TINA, we would like to get funds and accelerate her development. While we are currently building a MVP, we wish to add more helpful functions and your funding will help us reach that goal faster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be able to provide the best streaming quality and lower the cost per stream, we require to engage on an annual plan with our streaming provider. Your support will cover parts of that to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your funds will also be utilized to engage with our prospective customer base through marketing and PR activities. We want to do it right in the very first time and we hope that you’ll help us in that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fitness enthusiasts will get free premium memberships, to use the platform all they want, full access to live and recorded sessions.</p>
<p>Fitness Instructors will get a free instructor premium account, with full access to schedule free or paid live or recorded classes. Premium access is the highest revenue tier. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>TINA.FIT is not just an app that lets fitness instructors run their live and online classes. It also allows them to monetize their sessions and restart their revenue streams.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TINA FIT lets fitness fans reconnect online with their favorite instructors and join in on their classes.</p>
<p>Fitness Instructors will now have a one stop shop to commercialize their work and get rewarded for all the hard work they put into their classes.</p>
<p>Fitness Enthusiasts can continue to train at home or while abroad, with their preferred instructor in their own language.</p>
<p>More than these features, we want to build a very complete fitness community solution.</p>
<p>We think this is pretty exciting. If you do too, then please consider investing in TINA. We will value all of your contributions and will use them to make this a real success. </p>

</p><p><b><i>Was ist ‹Healing Garden›? </i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>‹Healing Garden› ist ein biodynamischer Heilpflanzengarten in Candelaria, Teneriffa. Das Projekt startet im Oktober 2014 auf 4000m2. Das Unternehmen ruht auf drei Säulen: Ökotourismus, Umweltpädagogik und, vor Allem, der Vertrieb von Heilpflanzen: Artemisia Annua Anamed, Moringa, Jiaogulan, Kurkuma, Ingwer, Zistrose, Guanabana, Ginseng etc.  </p>
<p><b><i>Wie entstand ‹Healing Garden›?</i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Im Frühjahr 2011 begann Ich in der Demeterlandwirtschaft zu arbeiten: zunächst auf dem ‹Trantenrotherhof›, danach auf dem ‹Hof Sackern› in Witten und schließlich auf dem ‹Dottenfelderhof› bei Frankfurt. – 2013 zog ich nach Candelaria und absolvierte dort ein einjähriges Praktikum im ‹Eridanos- Zentrum für Salutogenese›, wo ich gemeinsam mit einem Freund einen vielseitigen Permakulturgarten anlegte.</p>
<p>Aus dem Wunsch heraus, mich mit der Landwirtschaft selbstständig zu machen, verbunden mit der Begeisterung für Heilpflanzen, die im subtropischen Klima Teneriffas besonders gut gedeihen, begann ich im Frühjahr 2014 mit der Konzeption von ‹Healing Garden›.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>Worin liegt der originäre Impuls von ‹Healing Garden›?</i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Mit ‹Healing Garden› soll ein vielfältiger Lebensraum entstehen, der sowohl nach den Prinzipien der Biodynamik als auch der Permakultur gestaltet ist: Geschlossene Kreisläufe, Berücksichtigung des Kosmos, große Vielfalt von Pflanzen und Tieren, Steigerung der Bodenfruchtbarkeit, Solarenergie, ‹Landwirtschaftliche Individualität›, biodynamische Präparate, natürlicher Pflanzenschutz, Synergie durch Mischkulturen und Fruchtfolge.</p>
<p>Im Besonderen sind es zwei Merkmale, die ‹Healing Garden› einzigartig machen. Der ‹Low-Budget› und ‹Do-it-yourself-Ansatz› der Permakultur: Beobachten, Konventionen hinterfragen, möglichst alles selbst machen aus recycelten oder gefundenen Materialien. Zweitens: Der Fokus liegt auf  – teils noch wenig erforschten aber viel versprechenden – Heilpflanzen, die das Projekt wirtschaftlich tragfähig machen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><i>      </i>                                   </p>
<p>
</p><p><b><i>Inwieweit stellt sich das Projekt den Herausforderungen der Zeit? </i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Zeiten von Ebola und anderen globalen Seuchengefahren wird zunehmend deutlich: Das isolierende Prinzip – das Isolieren einzelner Stoffe zum Zwecke der Herstellung von Medikamenten – ist an sein Ende gekommen. Die traditionelle Pharmazie wird einerseits immer un-bezahlbarer, vor Allen für jene, die sie am dringendsten benötigen. Auf der anderen Seite zeigt sich, dass Viren und andere Erreger sich an isolierte Substanzen in kürzester Zeit anpassen und somit selbst teure Medikamente beängstigend schnell ihre Wirksamkeit verlieren.</p>
<p>Insofern ist ‹Healing Garden› ein Ort der Ganzheit im besten Sinne: Die produzierten Heilpflanzen wirken nachgewiesenermaßen als Ganzes – keine teure Isolation einzelner Stoffe – besser, als die Medikamente, die daraus hergestellt werden könnten: Die Extrakte der ganzen Pflanze  enthalten oft hunderte wirksamer Substanzen, die sich gegenseitig ergänzen, und sie sind dazu wesentlich erschwinglicher – sie kosten etwa ein Zehntel dessen, was die daraus gewonnenen Medikamente kosten würden. Sie bekämpfen zudem nicht nur einzelne Symptome, sondern sie helfen dem aus der Balance geratenen Organismus, sich selbst zu heilen. </p>
<p>Darüber hinaus ist ‹Healing Garden› als Ganzes ein komplexes System, ein Organismus, an dem exemplarisch aufgezeigt und studiert werden kann, wie ganzheitliches Denken und damit tatsächliche Nachhaltigkeit für unseren Planeten in der Praxis aussehen können.</p><p><br/></p>

</p><p>
</p><p><i>     </i> </p>
<p><b><i>Wie wirken die Ergebnisse/Erkenntnisse/Erzeugnisse weiter, sind sie Anregungen für Andere? </i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Auf den Kanaren wird bis heute DDT verwendet, der Einsatz von Pestiziden in der Landwirtschaft ist dort doppelt so hoch wie im übrigen Spanien. Darüber hinaus herrscht eine Jugendarbeitslosenquote von rund Fünfzig Prozent, staatliche Langzeit-Arbeitslosenhilfe gibt es nicht.</p>

</p><p><i>«Im Allgemeinen neigen wir dazu, zu überschätzen, was wir in einem Jahr erreichen können. – Doch wir neigen ebenso dazu, zu unterschätzen, was wir in fünf bis acht Jahren erreichen können». </i><i>Fritz Helmut Hemmerich</i></p>
<p>Die Startphase des Unternehmens ist auf fünf bis acht Jahre angelegt. Einige der Heilpflanzen, wie die zunehmend bekannter werdende ‹Moringa› oder die antitumoral wirkende ‹Guanabana›, sind Bäume, die – auch wenn sie relativ schnell wachsen – mindestens fünf Jahre benötigen, bis sie ausreichend Blätter produzieren. Eine ähnlich lange Zeit dauert es, bis Ginsengwurzeln geerntet werden können. Sind diese und weitere Pflanzen jedoch erst einmal fest im Boden verwurzelt, produzieren sie stetig, ergiebig und ohne viel Arbeitsaufwand. – Das gleiche gilt für das aus der Permakultur entlehnte Konzept ‹food forrest› insgesamt. Ist ein vielfältiger und klug gestalteter ‹essbarer› oder in diesem Falle ‹medizinischer› Wald erst einmal über die Pionierphase hinausgekommen, produziert er stetig und benötigt dabei relativ wenig äußere Pflege.</p>
<p>Pflanzen wie das aus China stammende Adaptogen ‹Jiaogulan›, das anitviral wirkende ‹Zystus› oder der gegen Rheuma hochwirksame ‹Pilli- Pilli-Pfeffer› dagegen wachsen wesentlich schneller: Bereits nach drei Monaten kann der Verkauf von Teeblättern, Essenzen und Salben auf dem Wochenmarkt und über das Internet beginnen. – Im ersten Jahr wird der Schwerpunkt vornehmlich auf ‹Artemisia Annua Anamed› liegen, einer Hybridzüchtung, die bisher vor Allem in Afrika angebaut wird und gegen Malaria, inzwischen aber auch zunehmend zur Linderung der Symptome  von Krebs, Aids und vielen weiteren Krankheiten verwendet wird. Mit dieser Pflanze liegen bereits sehr positive Erfahrungen vor, sowohl was den erfolgreichen Anbau auf Teneriffa als auch was den Direktverkauf sowie die unmittelbaren Wirksamkeit als Medikament betrifft: </p>
<p>Geerntet wird Artemisia 10 Monate nach Aussaat. Im ersten Jahr werden rund 200 bis 300 Kilogramm auf rund 1000m2 produziert und anschließend in 50-Gramm-Päckchen zu je 8€ auf dem lokalen Wochenmarkt vetrieben. </p><p><br/></p>
<p>Die Mietkosten für das Land betragen monatlich 200€, die Kosten für Wasser liegen bei 60 Cent/m3 oder 50-200€ im Monat. Die Installation eines effizienten Tröpfchen-Bewässerungssystems liegt bei einmaligen 200€ plus 16 bis 48 Cent/m2, je nachdem, wie eng gepflanzt wird.</p>
<p>Saatgut ist bereits ausreichend vorhanden, anfallende Kosten sind beliebig hoch, können aber zB. durch den Austausch mit anderen Gärtnern relativ niedrig gehalten werden. Ähnliches gilt für Werkzeuge. Da so gut wie alles in Handarbeit erledigt wird, fallen nur geringe Kosten für Maschinen und Strom an. Eine kleine Solarzelle kostet rund 500€.</p>
<p>Am Anfang, solange noch keine Tiere vor Ort sind, muss Kompost zugekauft werden. Durch den Anbau von stickstofffixierenden Pflanzen und die eigene Herstellung von ‹18-Tage-Kompost› mit Hilfe von Mist, Stroh und Wasser sowie weitere Techniken aus der Permakultur können auch hier die Kosten relativ niedrig gehalten werden. 18m3 hochwertiger Mulch kosten 300€. </p>
<p>Für den Bau von Zäunen, Ställen sowie das Schaffen von Schattenflächen werden einfache Materialien wie Draht, Folie, Schilf, Palmenblätter und Holzpaletten verwendet, die Kosten dafür sind überschaubar. Das absolute Minimum um das erste, laufende Jahr zu finanzieren, bis die Artemisia-pflanzen geerntet werden können und ein stetiges Einkommen erzeugen beträgt 8000€.</p><p><br/></p>

‹Healing Garden› ist ein biodynamischer Heilpflanzengarten in Candelaria, Teneriffa. Das Projekt startet im Oktober 2014 auf 4000m2. Das Unternehmen ruht auf drei Säulen: Ökotourismus, Umweltpädagogik und, vor Allem, der Vertrieb von Heilpflanzen: Artemisia Annua Anamed, Moringa, Jiaogulan, Kurkuma, Ingwer, Zistrose, Guanabana, Ginseng etc.  
Wie entstand ‹Healing Garden›?

Im Frühjahr 2011 begann Ich in der Demeterlandwirtschaft zu arbeiten: zunächst auf dem ‹Trantenrotherhof›, danach auf dem ‹Hof Sackern› in Witten und schließlich auf dem ‹Dottenfelderhof› bei Frankfurt. – 2013 zog ich nach Candelaria und absolvierte dort ein einjähriges Praktikum im ‹Eridanos- Zentrum für Salutogenese›, wo ich gemeinsam mit einem Freund einen vielseitigen Permakulturgarten anlegte.
Aus dem Wunsch heraus, mich mit der Landwirtschaft selbstständig zu machen, verbunden mit der Begeisterung für Heilpflanzen, die im subtropischen Klima Teneriffas besonders gut gedeihen, begann ich im Frühjahr 2014 mit der Konzeption von ‹Healing Garden›.


                                                                              






                                                                                                  Im Permakulturgarten auf Teneriffa





Worin liegt der originäre Impuls von ‹Healing Garden›?

Mit ‹Healing Garden› soll ein vielfältiger Lebensraum entstehen, der sowohl nach den Prinzipien der Biodynamik als auch der Permakultur gestaltet ist: Geschlossene Kreisläufe, Berücksichtigung des Kosmos, große Vielfalt von Pflanzen und Tieren, Steigerung der Bodenfruchtbarkeit, Solarenergie, ‹Landwirtschaftliche Individualität›, biodynamische Präparate, natürlicher Pflanzenschutz, Synergie durch Mischkulturen und Fruchtfolge.
Im Besonderen sind es zwei Merkmale, die ‹Healing Garden› einzigartig machen. Der ‹Low-Budget› und ‹Do-it-yourself-Ansatz› der Permakultur: Beobachten, Konventionen hinterfragen, möglichst alles selbst machen aus recycelten oder gefundenen Materialien. Zweitens: Der Fokus liegt auf  – teils noch wenig erforschten aber viel versprechenden – Heilpflanzen, die das Projekt wirtschaftlich tragfähig machen.

                                         

Inwieweit stellt sich das Projekt den Herausforderungen der Zeit? 

In Zeiten von Ebola und anderen globalen Seuchengefahren wird zunehmend deutlich: Das isolierende Prinzip – das Isolieren einzelner Stoffe zum Zwecke der Herstellung von Medikamenten – ist an sein Ende gekommen. Die traditionelle Pharmazie wird einerseits immer un-bezahlbarer, vor Allen für jene, die sie am dringendsten benötigen. Auf der anderen Seite zeigt sich, dass Viren und andere Erreger sich an isolierte Substanzen in kürzester Zeit anpassen und somit selbst teure Medikamente beängstigend schnell ihre Wirksamkeit verlieren.
Insofern ist ‹Healing Garden› ein Ort der Ganzheit im besten Sinne: Die produzierten Heilpflanzen wirken nachgewiesenermaßen als Ganzes – keine teure Isolation einzelner Stoffe – besser, als die Medikamente, die daraus hergestellt werden könnten: Die Extrakte der ganzen Pflanze  enthalten oft hunderte wirksamer Substanzen, die sich gegenseitig ergänzen, und sie sind dazu wesentlich erschwinglicher – sie kosten etwa ein Zehntel dessen, was die daraus gewonnenen Medikamente kosten würden. Sie bekämpfen zudem nicht nur einzelne Symptome, sondern sie helfen dem aus der Balance geratenen Organismus, sich selbst zu heilen. 
Darüber hinaus ist ‹Healing Garden› als Ganzes ein komplexes System, ein Organismus, an dem exemplarisch aufgezeigt und studiert werden kann, wie ganzheitliches Denken und damit tatsächliche Nachhaltigkeit für unseren Planeten in der Praxis aussehen können.

Wie wirken die Ergebnisse/Erkenntnisse/Erzeugnisse weiter, sind sie Anregungen für Andere? 

Auf den Kanaren wird bis heute DDT verwendet, der Einsatz von Pestiziden in der Landwirtschaft ist dort doppelt so hoch wie im übrigen Spanien. Darüber hinaus herrscht eine Jugendarbeitslosenquote von rund Fünfzig Prozent, staatliche Langzeit-Arbeitslosenhilfe gibt es nicht.
‹Healing Garden› könnte eine Art ‹Leuchtturm› sein, der zeigt, dass man sich seinen Arbeitsplatz auch selbst schaffen kann mit etwas, das auch für die Umwelt gut ist und das dazu auch noch eine Menge Spass macht! 
Die Kanaren gehören zu den biodiversesten Lebensräumen unseres Planeten, ein Drittel der hier wachsenden Pflanzen ist endemisch, weswegen sie auch die ‹Galapagosinseln der Botaniker› genannt werden.
                                                                    Artemisiakeimlinge nach drei Wochen, September 2014
Die produzierte Heilpflanzen kommen zunächst der lokalen Bevölkerung zu Gute: sie sind effizient, kostengünstig, frei von Nebenwirkungen und sie leisten durch die Unterstützung von ‹Healing Garden› einem Beitrag zu Naturschutz und Artenvielfalt. 
Die Hälfte der Agrarflächen auf Teneriffa liegt brach! Der Anbau von Heilpflanzen könnten – über dieses Modellprojekt hinaus – eine Möglichkeit sein, das in Europa einzigartige Klima der Kanaren für den weltweiten Export zu erschließen und so extensive, ökologische Landwirtschaft wieder attraktiv und rentabel zu machen und darüber hinaus die wachsende Nische des Öko- und Agrartourismus auszubauen.

</p><p>Spud Alford, founder and CEO of the parent company stated that 
the National Finger Football League was off and running so it was just a
 natural progression to take our Finger Golf game and give golfers the 
same national platform.  “I would guess that 75% of America’s population
 has at some time flicked a piece of paper or a pack of sugar across a 
table, whether in a lunchroom or a restaurant setting, hoping to score a
 touchdown by skillfully causing the object to rest with one portion of 
it hanging over the table’s edge. We simply took the concept to a whole 
new level.”<br/><br/>In the Zelosport Finger Golf version, according to 
Spud, “It is the only national competition to my knowledge where a 
child, a parent and a grandparent in the same family and of either 
gender can compete together with an equal chance at winning.” <br/><br/>An 18 city tour is being developed starting in 2014 with test events being held earlier in the year.  </p><p>
</p><p><br/>With a recent study showing that the number one thing young
 people prefer to do is spend time with their family, Zelosport will 
create an environment that is wholesome and fun allowing sports 
enthusiasts a chance to compete with and against their own family 
members. Tanner Childs, a 19 year old from Columbus, Ga. who competed in
 and won a “test” Finger Football tournament held in 2006 when he was 
just 11 said “I made it all the way to the finals and wound up competing
 against my 47 year old uncle. And I beat him!” Tanner added, “It’s just
 a great way to spend a Saturday. And it’s not a computer game. The 
players are actually doing something. Everyone was competing as though 
we were on national television.”  <br/><br/>Spud, the inventor of the 
games, is actually himself a former U.S. Olympic hopeful in the 10 event
 decathlon. His whole idea behind the concept was to create games that 
families can play together in their kitchens and living rooms while 
building lasting memories. “The PFG Tour was simply a natural 
progression of the board game created in 2007 with tour players having 
partial ownership in the PFGT.”<br/><br/>A survivor of testicular cancer,

FULLY FUNDED!


Please follow on Twitter @NourishThriveCo


Hello Friends!
My name is Brittany Van Ness and I am in pursuit of a seat on the Millennial Trains Project (MTP). I am passionate about holistic health and nutrition, especially for its application in cancer prevention and patient care. 
Poor diet and a lack of exercise are two key factors in increasing cancer risk, and about one third of all cancer deaths are linked to these same risk factors [1].


On the MTP journey, my goal is to gather industry-accepted health and nutrition practices from experts across the American South.  I would have access to some of the best resources across the country while meeting with cutting edge oncology and research centers. Through insights gained from the MTP experience, my objective is to spread awareness of the nutrition-health connection and create an accessible  guide to lead cancer patients and the general public to better health.



The Project

My project is The Nourish & Thrive Initiative - and with it, I want to open a conversation about health and nutrition for cancer patients. I want to erase the information gap between today's research and the average citizen. Reducing cancer risk and deaths is a real and tangible goal and it all starts with making this information accessible for all.With my MTP journey, I will lay the foundation to create a toolkit to maximize nutrition and minimize environmental risks during cancer treatment and recovery. This information would serve as a road map regardless of diagnosis, geography, or economic status.




The Problem, The Vision, & The Future

Each year 14 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed around the world [2], this is leading to a massive community of patients within the United States that is currently being underserved. Cancer patients are often limited to the information provided by their local doctors or the cancer services available within their region. I believe that patients deserve easier access to top-rate nutrition and health guidance regardless of their geography. I want to help foster the creation of a multidisciplinary approach to health with obtainable directives that leads cancer patients though treatments, harsh side effects, and post-treatment recovery. In much of the country, there is a disconnect between cutting edge research and the direction given to cancer patients in terms of nutrition, mental health practices, and environmental risks. I want to close this gap, and create an accessible resource to help patients take control of the health variables within their personal power. 


The Game-plan 

I will take time in each city to meet with a variety of experts in the fields of cancer treatment, nutrition, health, and non-profit organizations that serve the greater cancer community across the United States. Through interviews and behind-the-scenes looks into some of the most successful programs in the country, I plan to gather a comprehensive introduction to lay the groundwork for a usable toolkit for cancer patients. 


The Breakdown

I've identified targets to meet with on the MTP journey in each city:


Los Angeles, CA: Simms/Mann – UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology; F C Cancer Foundation


Austin, TX: Whole Foods Market Headquarters


San Antonio, TX: University of Texas, Cancer Therapy & Research Center (CTRC); Center for Integrative Oncology - A Division of Oncology San Antonio


New Orleans, LA: Tulane University Center for Culinary Medicine; The ReFresh Project and SPROUT NOLA


Atlanta, GA: The American Cancer Society; The World Health Organization; Cancer Treatment Centers of America


Washington D.C.: The American Institute for Cancer Research; The National Cancer Institute; Environmental Working Group

<p>Hello!  My name
is Eduardo Dysangco and I am the manager of the 2015, 12U Northwest Travelers
Baseball Team.  The Northwest Travelers Baseball Organization (NWT) is a
completely volunteer-run, not-for-profit organization. We are committed to
providing safe, fun, and family-oriented baseball instruction and experience to
9 to 14 year-old boys in the northwest Chicagoland area.</p>
<p>Each year the NWT
12-year-old team takes a trip to Cooperstown, New York, to participate in the
Cooperstown Dreams Park Tournament. </p>
<p> The tournament
comes as an additional expense to these players’ regular season costs, and that
is why we are asking for your help.</p>
<p><b>What We Need and What You Will Get!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The estimated total cost for the Cooperstown Experience
     is $15,000.  We are asking for half of this total.  We will raise the remainder through other
     fundraisers we are holding locally in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago.</li>
<li>Money raised will go towards: Tournament Fees, Baseball Training, Uniforms, Trading Pins, and Umpire Fees, and many more!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal we use our funds towards the
     tournament and extra expenses will be covered by the players individual
     family pockets.</li>

<li>$250.00 - Receive the perks above and team autographed baseball (who knows one of these boys could become a baseball star and the ball would be worth millions)</li>
</ul></div><p><b>Make the Difference</b></p>
<p></p>This is an experience of a lifetime for ballplayers and families alike. This tournament affords the boys valuable experience in being independent and accountable for their actions and provides an incredible look inside the history and traditions of the game of baseball.  <div>
<br/>The players and coaches will stay together as a team throughout the 6 Day tournament. They will build a stronger bond; where friendships last a lifetime.  In addition, these boys will compete and meet players from all across the nation.  </div><div>Your generous contribution will make a difference for these boys.</div><div><br/></div><div><div>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>If we don't raise enough funds there is a possibility that the boys won't make the tournament in Cooperstown.  We will do our best in getting close to our fundraising goal and calculate the out of pocket expenses each family will need to provide.  If it is manageable we will go.</p>
<p>A major challenge is there are 2 other teams in our organization going to Cooperstown as well!  So, the pool of people attending our local fundraisers will be lower than normal.  We would work together as an organization to help teams that are short.  For example, if we are over our goal and another team is short - we would contribute money to help.   </p>

He had been suffering from renal failure for years and was down to about 15% function. He had lost all his energy and struggled with dizzy spells, nausea, vomiting, confusion, memory loss, and at 19 years old, I was faced with the very real fear of losing my dad. <br/><br/>Only 7 months before his surgery, in May, I had my 3rd and 4th spine surgery to take care of a spinal infection that resulted from scoliosis complications. My parents were already struggling with the hospital bills, the follow up appointments, and the cost of the intravenous medications I had to be on for 5 months. All the while, my parents were also worrying about how we would pay for his much needed treatments and when we would ever see a kidney match for him.</p>
<p><br/>Little did we know, my grandmother had already begun tests to find out if she was a match to her son. In August, my grandmother told my dad that she was willing to donate one of her kidneys to him. Obviously, my dad resisted only to be met with, ""What if your daughter came to you and told you her kidneys were failing, what would you do?"" Needless to say, he then accepted her offer.</p>
<p><br/>On December 11th, while at one of my follow up appointments, my dad got a call from UCSF. My grandma and dad were green to go for surgery.</p>
<p><br/>We were so happy and so appreciative to my grandma. Only 7 years prior, she gave two-thirds of her liver to her dying sister, and now she would give the gift of life once again to her baby, my dad. My super grandma gave my dad life twice.</p>
<p>Now, it has been about 4 weeks since the surgeries. My dad is recovering very well and so is my grandma. But now, we are being faced with the financial burden...Only one of my dad's anti-rejection medications cost $3,754 and his insurance is giving us a bit of trouble. In order to pay for a majority of his medical costs for the rest of the year, he and my mom will have to come up with $3,000.</p>
<p><br/>My grandma is a wonderful, hard working woman and she has always wanted to go on a cruise. My parents and I all feel that she deserves such a gift after the gifts she has given others. Please help us raise some money to get my dad's medications and send my super-grandma on her dream cruise.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome,
and thank you for visiting my Indiegogo page. I am embarking on my dream of sharing yoga where it will have
a tremendous impact on the well-being of children.<span>
I will spend one month this spring collaborating with local yoga teachers and organizations to promote mind-body programs. My goal is to offer yoga as a form of mind-body
healing and to support local organizations in building viable yoga-based
programs. I will spend time in Jordan and Turkey and will volunteer to:
(1) instruct yoga for children and youth in health and community centres;
and (2) facilitate pediatric yoga therapy training programs for local yoga
teachers and health professionals.</span></p><p>
Your support will be instrumental in allowing me to create and
deliver the best training resources possible in order to share yoga where it
will have a significant impact. Below are details about the mission. You can
follow progress <a href=""www.robynlongyoga.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/yoga-in-bethlehem/edit/www.robynlongyoga.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on my blog</a>.<br/><br/></p><h2><b>Why Yoga?</b></h2>
<p>Palestinian
and Syrian children are exposed to regular violence such
as military operations. As a result, an alarming percentage experience
post-traumatic stress symptoms such as problems sleeping, a constant feeling of
anxiety and insecurity, and difficulty concentrating in school. On top of this
reality, and close to my heart, a handful of children are also battling cancer
and suffering from treatment-related side effects such as extreme fatigue and
muscular deconditioning.</p>
<p>Yoga is a mindful
activity that supports the interrelated physical, social, and emotional needs
of children. Yoga practices tailored to their needs will provide these children
with an opportunity to experience relaxation and a sense of peace within
themselves. Also, through yoga, children can learn tools to identify and
regulate their feelings, such as breathing practices to help them calm down if
they feel anxious.</p>
<p>Local health and community organizations are eager to develop therapeutic mindfulness
and relaxation programs that promote healing and resiliency. Based on a
preliminary yoga-teaching visit last summer, I was invited to return and help
build yoga-based programs at community centers, including the Huda Al
Masri Childhood Cancer Centre (see my <u>blog on the experience</u> from last summer's visit). Syrian civil society organizations are eager to support their human rights advocates. Yoga is a unique program that can support the courageous, inspiring work of local organizations. <br/><br/></p>
<h2><b>Resources
Needed</b></h2>
<p>One of the
advantages of yoga is that it is a low-cost intervention since minimal
equipment is needed. I will volunteer my time to teach yoga, create materials,
and facilitate trainings.  Local collaborators will assist with
translating materials into Arabic. Still, there are basic expenses for this
project and your support will ensure it is feasible:</p>
<p> * Travel
to and within Jordan and Turkey, lodging, communications, visas</p>
<p> * Travel for Palestinian yoga teachers from Bethlehem to visit Amman for training programs </p><p>* Honorarium
for a photographer to take photos in order to create yoga materials for
children (for example, handouts with breathing exercises they can practice at
home before bed)</p>
<p>  * Printing
yoga handouts for participants and training materials for teachers</p>
<p>While yoga
mats and props are nice to have, they are not included due to the project’s
goal of reaching a large number of participants. In fact, in India, children’s
yoga classes are generally taught without any mats or props. For children with
limited mobility or who may be ill, we will adapt yoga poses by using chairs or
other readily available props such as pillows. <br/>
<br/><b>
I have set a fundraising goal of $2,000, which is lower than the actual cost in
order to lessen the fundraising pressure since this is my first “fixed funding”
(i.e. all or nothing) campaign.</b> Any extra funds will enable me to print more
copies of materials or purchase basic yoga props/resources. <br/><span><br/>
<span>When you join my community of supporters, I will
add you to my email list for regular updates. You have the option to give any
amount and anonymously. All amounts make a significant contribution (and fuel
the project’s energy!). Please refer to Indiegogo's page </span><span><span>for details on giving anonymously</span></span>. 

<br/><br/></span></p><p></p><h2><b><span>The Impact</span></b></h2>
Your support will make a tremendous difference in the daily lives of children in the Middle East. Your help will ensure that:
<br/><br/><p>* Children
participate in fun, nurturing yoga classes and learn tools that strengthen
their resiliency</p>
<p>* Yoga
teachers and health workers gain new skills to promote children’s wellness</p>
<p>* Yoga
resources are free and accessible to community centers and clinics</p>
<p>Ultimately,
this project is building a foundation for community-based yoga and other
mindfulness-based programs that will support children in healing the wounds of war.
Yoga provides a holistic and cost-effective approach to the physical, mental,
emotional, and spiritual needs of children. <br/><br/></p>
<h2><b>Risks and
Challenges</b></h2>
<p>As with all
projects in the region, yoga classes and trainings could be delayed or
challenged by political situations. This is why flexible support from this campaign is critical! It enables yoga teachers to move the location of a training or class as necessary. In the end, passionate teachers will always find creative solutions to promote peace and healing. <br/><br/></p>

Bostinno - DC Based IndieGoGo Campaign Calls Upon Harvard Robotics Team to Help Cure MalariaSANARIA is a biotechnology company located in Rockville, Maryland, USA. Sanaria has developed a malaria vaccine that protects against the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, responsible for more than 98% of malaria associated deaths world-wide.Until now no vaccine has ever fully protected people against the malaria parasite. Sanaria’s PfSPZ Vaccine now shows real promise in meeting that standard. In August 2013 Sanaria published groundbreaking clinical trial results: In the group that received the highest dose, PfSPZ Vaccine was 100% protective against malaria. See the results published in Science magazine here. As a result we received extensive press coverage for this groundbreaking achievement. Read the New York Times article on SporoBot™ here.Currently we do a key step of the vaccine manufacturing process by hand. To reduce the cost of the vaccine and scale up production, we need to automate this key step.All funds received from the campaign will be directly used to develop and implement SporoBot™. SporoBot™ will automate a key component of the manufacturing process, facilitating inexpensive mass production of the critically needed malaria vaccine. We've built the parts, we've demonstrated they work, now we need to assemble SporoBot™ into a working prototype. And for this, we need your help.With SporoBot™, Sanaria’s PfSPZ Vaccine can be made accessible to the millions of people most at risk. Please help protect these people to prevent the more than 200 million cases and more than 600,000 deaths caused by malaria every year. Worldwide NeedAUTOMATION DEVELOPMENTSanaria’s PfSPZ Vaccine is made from living, weakened malaria parasites (called sporozoites) that trigger protective immunity without causing disease. The sporozoites are produced in mosquitoes, and become concentrated in the insects' salivary glands. To make the vaccine, Sanaria’s mosquito dissectors remove the heads of mosquitoes and extract their salivary glands. Currently, we do this by hand dissection, but to produce the quantities of vaccine needed to treat hundreds of millions of people as quickly and as inexpensively as possible, we want to automate this process. Our plan is to develop a robot we call SporoBot™ and use it in performing this crucial step in vaccine production. As a result, we will increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease costs. With your help we can and will do both.RAPID PRODUCTIONWe estimate one SporoBot™ will be able to produce vaccine at 20 - 30 times our current efficiency. While we go forward using the current manufacturing process, SporoBot™ will enable greater productivity and will permit a more rapid production and deployment of greater quantities of the vaccine. Greater abundance and faster deployment of the vaccine will push forward the eventual elimination of malaria and the immeasurable improvement in the lives of billions of people now living under the threat of this disease.Who We AreIn 2003, Dr. Stephen Hoffman and Dr. Kim Lee Sim started Sanaria at the kitchen table of their home. Nearly 50 scientists, researchers, and innovators have joined the Sanaria team. With grant funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we built our clinical manufacturing facility and our insectory in Rockville, Maryland. Why Crowdfunding?Grants and Awards from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institutes of Health, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and the US Department of Defense and others have supported Sanaria since its founding in 2003. The recent government sequester reduced our access to funds that would have otherwise been available for projects such as SporoBot™. Grants from private and public institutions continue to support our ongoing research and clinical trials at home and overseas in Africa and Europe. But the processes in place to seek multi-million dollar grants to fund new projects, such as SporoBot™, can take years to process, and they are not guaranteed.

birth of your own child, this sacred moment. Can you feel your heart?
Full of love, joy, strength, excitement, all at once. Can you imagine
that you trust Life, that you trust Nature, and follow your wisdom,
whether you are the one who is giving birth, or the one supporting
your women. Can you see people around you? They are calm and
supportive. They embrace birthing mum, so that she can be in tune
with herself and her baby. In this peaceful atmosphere everybody
knows what to do and what is needed at that very moment. And your
baby can feel wanted and welcomed in this world, in your family.
Gentle and loving hands, kisses, mums heartbeat, a beautiful

Story</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,
my name is Kasia Slazak and birth is my passion. 
</p>
<p>I
work as doula, which means that I help people to prepare for birth on
emotional, physical and spiritual level. I assist during the labour
and I can help afterwords, too. It is amazing for me to see how
people change. They grow and become stronger on their journey into
parenthood, they come to be more
confident in caring for this little new being, their
baby. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For
me Life is about this moment, and I believe that Ceremonies help us
being present and make Life more enjoyable. This is why I offer
Ceremonies during the pregnancy and after birth. And touch, it is so
important for humans. I love it, so yes, I teach Baby massage and I
offer pregnancy massage to mums, so that they can be more relaxed and
enjoy their pregnancy. I am also active in many other ways connected
to birth. You can read about who I am and what I do on this website:

birth of your own child, this sacred moment. Can you feel your heart?
Full of love, joy, strength, excitement, all at once. Can you imagine
that you trust Life, that you trust Nature, and follow your wisdom,
whether you are the one who is giving birth, or the one supporting
your women. Can you see people around you? They are calm and
supportive. They embrace birthing mum, so that she can be in tune
with herself and her baby. In this peaceful atmosphere everybody
knows what to do and what is needed at that very moment. And your
baby can feel wanted and welcomed in this world, in your family.
Gentle and loving hands, kisses, mums heartbeat, a beautiful
beginning... 


I
wish all of us could experience such a blissful birth. 



Our
Story

Hello,
my name is Kasia Slazak and birth is my passion. 

I
work as doula, which means that I help people to prepare for birth on
emotional, physical and spiritual level. I assist during the labour
and I can help afterwords, too. It is amazing for me to see how
people change. They grow and become stronger on their journey into
parenthood, they come to be more
confident in caring for this little new being, their
baby. 


For
me Life is about this moment, and I believe that Ceremonies help us
being present and make Life more enjoyable. This is why I offer
Ceremonies during the pregnancy and after birth. And touch, it is so
important for humans. I love it, so yes, I teach Baby massage and I
offer pregnancy massage to mums, so that they can be more relaxed and
enjoy their pregnancy. I am also active in many other ways connected
to birth. You can read about who I am and what I do on this website:
www.smileysoul.co.uk




The
impact

I
believe that the way we arrive to this world has a significant impact
on the quality of our lives. This is why I promote natural and
conscious birth.

Birth
is life changing. I feel that trusting Nature and wisdom of the body
can make it an empowering experience. With Nature on our side giving
birth can be so much easier.
There
is birth
center
in Bali where they believe in the power of Nature and help women and
babies to experience birth as an empowering moment. I really wanted
to go there and learn from them directly, because they approach
the miracle of birth with trust and humility. I applied for a place

I
decided to go anyway, despite uncertainty, obstacles and all

I
will probably need less money now, but there is no option of
changing the goal on this site. Whatever money I'll have left at the

<p>My name is Mary and although I now call Toronto home, for most of my childhood I enjoyed living in Madeira Island Portugal. It was a beautiful place with friendly people and a great climate year round. Today the island is a well known tourist destination with its semi-tropical climate, beautiful landscapes and world renowned Madeira wine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately on July 18, 2012 fire broke out in various wooded areas in the higher elevations of the island. An unfortunate combination of lack of rain, temperatures in the mid 30’s to low 40’s and high winds quickly spread the out-of-control fires to residential areas. The island did not have enough firefighters to accommodate the multitude of fires in the different regions. People did their best to protect their properties with garden hoses and buckets, however, water being in such demand; many were left with dry tanks and no means of protecting themselves and their properties from the fires. Some recount how the fires leapt from one area to another quickly surrounding them in a matter of minutes. Many were evacuated from their homes taking nothing with them, only to return to burnt rubble and ashes where once their most prized possession, their homes, had stood. To add to this tragedy, most do not have property insurance, so there is no claim to be made or chance of recovery of their losses.</p>
<p>The once beautiful lush green countryside is now, in large areas of the island, scorched and gray. Gone are some of the beautiful banana plantations and vineyards.</p>
<p>Many animals perished – from pets to livestock – and of the livestock that did survive the farmer now has the dilemma of how to feed these animals that once grazed on the abundant greens of the countryside.</p>
<p>The current surreal grey environment will have a major impact on its vital Tourism industry. As for government assistance, from what I have seen on Portuguese television, folks aren’t optimistic to say the least. As we all know the current economic situation in Europe is difficult and this too will have an impact in the help provided to those affected.</p>
<p><strong>The people of Madeira need your help.</strong> For the many who lost their homes, possessions, farms, livestock and pets, for those who suffered damage to their property and now have no means of making the necessary repairs – you can help! Every dollar collected will go directly to those affected.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot provide charitable donation receipts, this is not a registered charity, merely a former Madeirense who never forgot her roots and truly feels for those back home. This is my way of reaching out and hopefully making a difference, but I can’t do it without you, so please help this worthy cause because together we can make a difference.</p>

<li>High and Consistent Concentration of Active Components - VV contains ingredients that have high concentrations of phytonutrients.</li>
<li>HPLC tested - All VV ingredients are tested by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, one of the most accurate tests for measuring the level of active ingredients in supplements. You can be certain the advertised quantity is correct.</li>
<li>Toxicity tested.</li>
<li>Phytosome utilization - A complex of a natural active ingredient and a phospholipid, phytosomes increase absorption of herbal extracts, consequently, the active ingredients in VV are enhanced for better absorption.</li>
<li>High dosage  - Many supplement companies sell potentially beneficial products in quantities and doses too small to be effective. VV  contains more than the minimum effective dose of each active nutrient, only possible through the usage of:</li>
<li>Micronization - This technology makes particles smaller, thus allowing more ingredients to fit into a smaller space. You will not have to swallow a large number of pills to get an effective dose.</li>
<li>Absorption Enhancers - Apart from the phytosomes and micronization, additional absorption enhancers are included in VV, bioperene and astragin, which together boost the absorption of the active ingredients another 100%, increasing the already impressive potency of the vitamin.</li>
</ul><u>Why do you need Virility Vitamin?</u><p></p><p>Studies indicate that the average level of testosterone in men has decreased every generation for over one hundred years. Cell phone radiation, estrogen contamination in food and water, un-athletic, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy, fattening food all contribute to the negative trend.</p><p>Estrogen, although necessary even in the male body in small amounts, wreaks havoc on a man's body in concentrations any higher than necessary.</p><p>Other contaminants that are not necessarily estrogen still cause a decrease in testosterone levels, such as cell phone radiation.</p><p>In addition, the male body did not evolve to sit in a desk all day, eating french fries and be drained psychologically by the rigors of the modern workforce. </p><p>It appears as though a perfect storm of factors has amassed to lower healthy male hormone levels, thus stealing a man's health and zest for life.</p><p>This is causing a gradual decrease in masculinity over time, more difficulty building muscle, less clear thinking, less ability to stabilize positive moods, more storage of body fat and many other effects.</p><p>One of the most drastic changes has been the deterioration of man's sexual capacity. Studies show that up to 78% of people that are married or are in a long-term, monogamous relationship are dissatisfied with their sex lives. Erectile dysfunction is at an all-time high; premature ejaculation is much more common that it should be. </p><p>Even if you believe yourself to be already healthy and virile, you will still notice a powerful, positive effect upon taking VV. </p><p>This vitamin will promote the proper functioning of the endocrine system, strengthen the body to fight estrogen contaminants, and boost free testosterone to optimal levels.</p><p>Virility Vitamin is comprised of phytonutrients, natural chemicals found in plants, to protect men's testosterone, vigor and manliness against the hazards of the modern world.</p><p><u>What is in the Virility Vitamin that makes it work so well?</u></p><p>All of the ingredients in VV are backed up by both academic research, and many years of use in folk medicine. Phytonutrients are beneficial chemicals found in plants, an exciting area of medical research that holds great promise for the future. These isolated phytonutrients and supporting additives are present in the vitamin:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Maca - a vegetable in the broccoli family resembling a turnip. It was grown in Peru where it was used as an aphrodisiac. It benefits both genders sexually, and is not known to interact negatively with any hormone.</li>
<li>Mucuna Pruriens - velvet bean is a bean that grows from trees which is a good source of L-DOPA. As L-DOPA levels increase in the body, prolactin (a protein that inhibits erections, and causes the refractory period) drops. It also promotes optimal levels of serotonin, which has been shown to delay ejaculation.</li>
<li>Eurycoma/Tongkat Ali - pro-fertility agent and aphrodisiac that has a large body of evidence supporting its anti-estrogen agency. It also contains 9H6One which promotes erections and delays ejaculation.</li>
<li>Grape Seed Extract - enhances blood flow and decreases estrogen levels.</li>
<li>L-Citrulline - turns into L-Arginine (a beneficial protein) after absorption, which proves to be a better source of L-Arginine than taking L-Arginine directly, regulates blood flow and promote stronger erections.</li>
<li>Bioperene - black pepper extract, increases absorption of active ingredients</li>
<li>Astragin - a natural compound composed of highly fractionated Astragalus and Panax Notoginseng, another absorption enhancer to increase effectiveness of VV dose.</li>
</ul><u>What's next for Virility Labs, LLC. after Virility Vitamin?</u><p></p><p></p><p>We will be preparing our next product: 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one
(9-HC-6-one)</p>
<p>9-hydroxycanthin-6-one (9-HC-6-one), a b-carboline alkaloid
isolated from Eurycoma longifolia Jack, also known as Tongkat Ali, is a plant
native to Indonesia and Malaysia that is known for its testosterone boosting
and libido enhancing properties. Tongkat ali increases the strength of
erections, and the b-carboline alkaloid 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has been
identified as the source of this erection enhancing property. It enhances
erections by interfering with Ca2+ mobilization. This is a totally different
mechanism of action than Viagra and other current erectile dysfunction drugs.
Consequently, 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has the potential to induce erections as
effectively as Viagra, but without as many side effects. Furthermore,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has an additional benefit, it treats premature
ejaculation. Studies show that 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one increased the time
between penetration and ejaculation by 400%, a result equivalent to the drug
Clomipramine, which is used to treat premature ejaculation. However,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has the potential to treat premature ejaculation with
far fewer side effects than Clomipramine. Clomipramine is an antidepressant
that has been known to decrease or even ruin men's libidos. By contrast,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one is not an antidepressant and has positive effects on
libido. </p>
<p>While Tongkat Ali, and by extension its component
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one, is currently an ingredient in Virility Vitamin,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has not been isolated for commercial use. The
concentrations of 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one  in Tongkat Ali are very small,
approximately 1% of the Tongkat Ali plant. Virility Labs would like to create
an over the counter supplement that will include large, concentrated amounts of
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one. </p>
<p>First, Virilty Labs must conduct additional tests on
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one to determine side effects. The study listed below shows
that the substance is non-toxic, however, a more detailed analysis of its side
effects is necessary. <br/><br/>
Second, Virility Labs must create a synthetic equivalent to
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one in a laboratory. It is not economically feasible to buy
the tons of Tongkat ali plants that would be necessary in order to extract a
commercially viable amount of 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one. Therefore, creating a
synthetic equivalent of 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one is the best option. <br/><br/>
Third, Virilty Labs must increase the bio-oral availability of
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one. In the aforementioned study, 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one was
administered via injection. Injection is not convenient on a daily basis,
therefore an oral delivery system must be delivered. Virility Labs has several
ideas for ensuring oral delivery, such as imbedding the 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one
molecules within phytosomes. </p>
<p>If
Virility Labs accomplishes these goals, it will have brought to the market an
affordable supplement that allows men to experience optimal erections and
delayed ejaculation with minimal side effects. <br/><br/><u>
Why aren't drug companies working on 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one?</u></p><p>Unfortunately, the
patent laws disincentivize drug companies bringing natural compounds to the
market. Compounds found in nature, such as 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one, cannot be
patented and therefore the drug companies cannot monopolize the sale of the
compound, which results in lower prices and, consequently, lower profits for
them when compared to their patented products. <br/><br/>
With your crowd funding support, Virilty Labs will attempt to bring this
product to the market so that men and their partners can benefit from on-demand
peak sexual performance.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>

We are a new, ambitious health supplement company devoted to self-improvement and betterment. In response to the dangerously decreasing average levels of testosterone in men, (contributing to obesity, depression, sexual inability, etc.) we have created the world's best male sexual health supplement.Ingredients included in Virility Vitamin have been scientifically proven to provide:
increased rigidity of erections
increased duration of erections
delayed ejaculation
increased intensity of ejaculation
increased volume of ejaculate
decrease length of refractory period
In addition to these benefits, a healthier hormonal balance and higher testosterone will improve psychological health as well increase effectiveness of diet and exercise.The BrodysseyTo celebrate the launch of Virility Vitamin and the IndieGoGo campaign, Virility Labs is launching the world's first official Bro-Odyssey, an exhaustive 30 day self-improvement journey. The program will be updated live daily via blogspot, and video journals will be uploaded biweekly to the Virility Labs YouTube channel.The Brodyssey includes programs and supplements from sources such as: Jamie Lewis at Chaos and Pain, Roosh V from Return of Kings, Rob Regish and all the guys at Mass Pro, Bryan Haycock from Think Muscle, Timothy Ferris from 4-Hour Work Week and many more.For updates, check out:www.theofficialbrodyssey.blogspot.com
What We Need & What You Get
Our funding goal is $50,000.00 USD. This will fund the procurement of supplies, necessary testing, encapsulation, bottling, labeling, and shipping of the first batch of Virility Vitamin, as well as an initial wave of marketing presence establishment. Any additional funding over our goal will be directly routed to Research & Development to conduct testing on 9-Hydroxycanthin-6-One, a b-carboline alkaloid isolated from the plant E.longifolia, shown in a promising study to promote penile erection and delay ejaculation by 400%If our funding goal is met, we will have the first batch of Virility Vitamin shipping out within 1-3 months of the completion of the campaign.Within 3-6 months, increase production levels of VV.Within 6-12 months, begin R&D for 9H6One.Within 12-18 months, develop a supplement utilizing 9H6One.The ImpactWhat makes VV different from other similar male sexual health supplements?Made in America - Virility Labs, LLC is proud to source all of its products from reputable American suppliers, and are subject to extensive quality and safety testing.
High and Consistent Concentration of Active Components - VV contains ingredients that have high concentrations of phytonutrients.
HPLC tested - All VV ingredients are tested by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, one of the most accurate tests for measuring the level of active ingredients in supplements. You can be certain the advertised quantity is correct.
Toxicity tested.
Phytosome utilization - A complex of a natural active ingredient and a phospholipid, phytosomes increase absorption of herbal extracts, consequently, the active ingredients in VV are enhanced for better absorption.
High dosage  - Many supplement companies sell potentially beneficial products in quantities and doses too small to be effective. VV  contains more than the minimum effective dose of each active nutrient, only possible through the usage of:
Micronization - This technology makes particles smaller, thus allowing more ingredients to fit into a smaller space. You will not have to swallow a large number of pills to get an effective dose.
Absorption Enhancers - Apart from the phytosomes and micronization, additional absorption enhancers are included in VV, bioperene and astragin, which together boost the absorption of the active ingredients another 100%, increasing the already impressive potency of the vitamin.
Why do you need Virility Vitamin?Studies indicate that the average level of testosterone in men has decreased every generation for over one hundred years. Cell phone radiation, estrogen contamination in food and water, un-athletic, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy, fattening food all contribute to the negative trend.Estrogen, although necessary even in the male body in small amounts, wreaks havoc on a man's body in concentrations any higher than necessary.Other contaminants that are not necessarily estrogen still cause a decrease in testosterone levels, such as cell phone radiation.In addition, the male body did not evolve to sit in a desk all day, eating french fries and be drained psychologically by the rigors of the modern workforce. It appears as though a perfect storm of factors has amassed to lower healthy male hormone levels, thus stealing a man's health and zest for life.This is causing a gradual decrease in masculinity over time, more difficulty building muscle, less clear thinking, less ability to stabilize positive moods, more storage of body fat and many other effects.One of the most drastic changes has been the deterioration of man's sexual capacity. Studies show that up to 78% of people that are married or are in a long-term, monogamous relationship are dissatisfied with their sex lives. Erectile dysfunction is at an all-time high; premature ejaculation is much more common that it should be. Even if you believe yourself to be already healthy and virile, you will still notice a powerful, positive effect upon taking VV. This vitamin will promote the proper functioning of the endocrine system, strengthen the body to fight estrogen contaminants, and boost free testosterone to optimal levels.Virility Vitamin is comprised of phytonutrients, natural chemicals found in plants, to protect men's testosterone, vigor and manliness against the hazards of the modern world.What is in the Virility Vitamin that makes it work so well?All of the ingredients in VV are backed up by both academic research, and many years of use in folk medicine. Phytonutrients are beneficial chemicals found in plants, an exciting area of medical research that holds great promise for the future. These isolated phytonutrients and supporting additives are present in the vitamin:
Maca - a vegetable in the broccoli family resembling a turnip. It was grown in Peru where it was used as an aphrodisiac. It benefits both genders sexually, and is not known to interact negatively with any hormone.
Mucuna Pruriens - velvet bean is a bean that grows from trees which is a good source of L-DOPA. As L-DOPA levels increase in the body, prolactin (a protein that inhibits erections, and causes the refractory period) drops. It also promotes optimal levels of serotonin, which has been shown to delay ejaculation.
Eurycoma/Tongkat Ali - pro-fertility agent and aphrodisiac that has a large body of evidence supporting its anti-estrogen agency. It also contains 9H6One which promotes erections and delays ejaculation.
Grape Seed Extract - enhances blood flow and decreases estrogen levels.
L-Citrulline - turns into L-Arginine (a beneficial protein) after absorption, which proves to be a better source of L-Arginine than taking L-Arginine directly, regulates blood flow and promote stronger erections.
Bioperene - black pepper extract, increases absorption of active ingredients
Astragin - a natural compound composed of highly fractionated Astragalus and Panax Notoginseng, another absorption enhancer to increase effectiveness of VV dose.
What's next for Virility Labs, LLC. after Virility Vitamin?We will be preparing our next product: 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one
(9-HC-6-one)
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one (9-HC-6-one), a b-carboline alkaloid
isolated from Eurycoma longifolia Jack, also known as Tongkat Ali, is a plant
native to Indonesia and Malaysia that is known for its testosterone boosting
and libido enhancing properties. Tongkat ali increases the strength of
erections, and the b-carboline alkaloid 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has been
identified as the source of this erection enhancing property. It enhances
erections by interfering with Ca2+ mobilization. This is a totally different
mechanism of action than Viagra and other current erectile dysfunction drugs.
Consequently, 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has the potential to induce erections as
effectively as Viagra, but without as many side effects. Furthermore,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has an additional benefit, it treats premature
ejaculation. Studies show that 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one increased the time
between penetration and ejaculation by 400%, a result equivalent to the drug
Clomipramine, which is used to treat premature ejaculation. However,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has the potential to treat premature ejaculation with
far fewer side effects than Clomipramine. Clomipramine is an antidepressant
that has been known to decrease or even ruin men's libidos. By contrast,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one is not an antidepressant and has positive effects on
libido. 
While Tongkat Ali, and by extension its component
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one, is currently an ingredient in Virility Vitamin,
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one has not been isolated for commercial use. The
concentrations of 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one  in Tongkat Ali are very small,
approximately 1% of the Tongkat Ali plant. Virility Labs would like to create
an over the counter supplement that will include large, concentrated amounts of
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one. 
First, Virilty Labs must conduct additional tests on
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one to determine side effects. The study listed below shows
that the substance is non-toxic, however, a more detailed analysis of its side
effects is necessary. 
Second, Virility Labs must create a synthetic equivalent to
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one in a laboratory. It is not economically feasible to buy
the tons of Tongkat ali plants that would be necessary in order to extract a
commercially viable amount of 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one. Therefore, creating a
synthetic equivalent of 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one is the best option. 
Third, Virilty Labs must increase the bio-oral availability of
9-hydroxycanthin-6-one. In the aforementioned study, 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one was
administered via injection. Injection is not convenient on a daily basis,
therefore an oral delivery system must be delivered. Virility Labs has several
ideas for ensuring oral delivery, such as imbedding the 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one
molecules within phytosomes. 
If
Virility Labs accomplishes these goals, it will have brought to the market an
affordable supplement that allows men to experience optimal erections and
delayed ejaculation with minimal side effects. 
Why aren't drug companies working on 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one?Unfortunately, the
patent laws disincentivize drug companies bringing natural compounds to the
market. Compounds found in nature, such as 9-hydroxycanthin-6-one, cannot be
patented and therefore the drug companies cannot monopolize the sale of the
compound, which results in lower prices and, consequently, lower profits for
them when compared to their patented products. 
With your crowd funding support, Virilty Labs will attempt to bring this
product to the market so that men and their partners can benefit from on-demand
peak sexual performance.

Beulah Baptist Institutional Church, located in Tampa,Florida started a medical
outreach ministry for the poor and under served children and families in Jamaica
approximately ten years ago.  We
started with the idea of helping to facilitate the delivery of free, accessible
and quality healthcare services to the poor in rural and under served communities in Jamaica and in correctional institutions.Our initial focus was on the Parish of St.Catherine.</p>
<p>The catalyst
for this program was a native-born Jamaican couple, Leslie and Elloreece
Burrell, who had been engaged in this health outreach with other organizations
since 1997. Leslie has since passed but
Elloreece continues to lead, direct and expand this mission throughout Jamaica
with a volunteer team of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, counselors, ministers,
and administrative assistants.  Beulah
  Baptist Institutional
  Church
and Mrs. Burrell’s efforts have been acknowledged and honored at the highest
levels of Jamaican Government, she as a caring member of the Jamaican Diaspora
and Beulah Baptist a church which takes seriously its call to be a servant
leader.</p>Since 2004 our mission team has made a major difference in the provision of healthcare relief for this under served population of Jamaicans, who in most cases get to receive medical treatment only when we make our annual visits to their communities.  While there are other missions throughout the country they are not enough and observing the existing conditions breaks your heart.<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><p> Annually our team from Beulah Baptist Institutional Church
travel to Jamaica to provide medical treatment, counseling, medicines and to
tell all about the Love and saving Grace of God our Father.All of the medical personnel volunteer their services,but all other costs of the trip such as flights,food &amp;lodging,supplies,medicines,medical license fees,local transportation,security,insurance and local administration assistance must be paid by the mission.The total estimated cost this year is $31,500.00 disbursed as follows;</p><p>Flights                    $8600.00</p><p>Food &amp;Lodging      $6500.00</p><p>Medicine                $8000.00</p><p>Supplies                $4500.00</p><p>Local Transport     $1200.00</p><p>Insurance             $   750.00</p><p>Security                $   750.00</p><p>Med Licenses       $   700.00</p><p>Local Admn           $   500.00</p><p>     Total                                           $31,500.00</p><p></p><ul><li>If we don't reach our total goal all collected funds will be used solely for the Medical Mission at a level commensurate with the contributions levels and church funds.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>There are plenty of countries with citizens in similar conditions as there are in Jamaica and need help also but we have been called to this area and are intent on making a difference for the good of these people in need.While much remains to be done we are confident that with your help and God's blessings we are making a difference.When people find out we are coming and start lining up at the crack of dawn or aged women set out walking from the hills at night to be seen by the doctor you thank God for this opportunity to serve and show His love.But it makes you cry when a senior citizen's monthly pension or assistance is equal to the cost of exactly one pill she needs for her medical condition and she hasn't had any since the 60 day supply we gave her last year ran out.This mission is very important and we need your help. </p>

Beulah Baptist Institutional Church, located in Tampa,Florida started a medical
outreach ministry for the poor and under served children and families in Jamaica
approximately ten years ago.  We
started with the idea of helping to facilitate the delivery of free, accessible
and quality healthcare services to the poor in rural and under served communities in Jamaica and in correctional institutions.Our initial focus was on the Parish of St.Catherine.
The catalyst
for this program was a native-born Jamaican couple, Leslie and Elloreece
Burrell, who had been engaged in this health outreach with other organizations
since 1997. Leslie has since passed but
Elloreece continues to lead, direct and expand this mission throughout Jamaica
with a volunteer team of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, counselors, ministers,
and administrative assistants.  Beulah
  Baptist Institutional
  Church
and Mrs. Burrell’s efforts have been acknowledged and honored at the highest
levels of Jamaican Government, she as a caring member of the Jamaican Diaspora
and Beulah Baptist a church which takes seriously its call to be a servant
leader.Since 2004 our mission team has made a major difference in the provision of healthcare relief for this under served population of Jamaicans, who in most cases get to receive medical treatment only when we make our annual visits to their communities.  While there are other missions throughout the country they are not enough and observing the existing conditions breaks your heart.What We Need & What You Get Annually our team from Beulah Baptist Institutional Church
travel to Jamaica to provide medical treatment, counseling, medicines and to
tell all about the Love and saving Grace of God our Father.All of the medical personnel volunteer their services,but all other costs of the trip such as flights,food &lodging,supplies,medicines,medical license fees,local transportation,security,insurance and local administration assistance must be paid by the mission.The total estimated cost this year is $31,500.00 disbursed as follows;Flights                    $8600.00Food &Lodging      $6500.00Medicine                $8000.00Supplies                $4500.00Local Transport     $1200.00Insurance             $   750.00Security                $   750.00Med Licenses       $   700.00Local Admn           $   500.00     Total                                           $31,500.00If we don't reach our total goal all collected funds will be used solely for the Medical Mission at a level commensurate with the contributions levels and church funds.The ImpactThere are plenty of countries with citizens in similar conditions as there are in Jamaica and need help also but we have been called to this area and are intent on making a difference for the good of these people in need.While much remains to be done we are confident that with your help and God's blessings we are making a difference.When people find out we are coming and start lining up at the crack of dawn or aged women set out walking from the hills at night to be seen by the doctor you thank God for this opportunity to serve and show His love.But it makes you cry when a senior citizen's monthly pension or assistance is equal to the cost of exactly one pill she needs for her medical condition and she hasn't had any since the 60 day supply we gave her last year ran out.This mission is very important and we need your help. 
Here is a
listing of our efforts in Jamaica
since this mission began and some of what we have accomplished:
· 
Provided
medications,supplies and equipment valued at over $450,000.
· 
Treated
over 5,500 patients and provided home visits for some who couldn't get to
healthcare centers.
· 
Counseled
some 4,000 students at schools and health fairs.
· 
Delivered
over 3,000+ books.
· 
Visited
women’s correctional institutions and provided medical treatment and
counseling.
· 
Established
and funded vocational programs in boys’ correctional institutions.
· 
Provided
barber chairs, supplies, tools and equipment for barber training programs.
· 
Ministered
to all and shared with them the important concept of salvation through Jesus
Christ.
As you can
see, over the years we have done a good job but there still remains plenty to
accomplish.You can help us make a difference in the lives of these people by joining hands and hearts through love and being a blessing to someone in need. Other Ways You Can HelpTo you, as my friends and “Christian family,” I am asking first for your prayers that God would continue to bless this mission, our church, the volunteer outreach team and the people of Jamaica through His Word and the medical treatments we provide.

Before we dive into the details,  we are excited to share with you a testimonial we received recently.Can you think of a time in your life (or in the life of someone close to you) when you were not in the best of health, either physically, emotionally or spiritually?And a little bit of prayer from people was something you really could do with?But honestly, how many people really prayed for you? If you are not a celebrity, then probably just a few, or maybe no one!Now, how about getting several people around the world to pray for you and send you healing energy? How about... say, 10, 20, 50, or even 100 people? Or probably even more?Until now, there was no organized 
way through which this was possible. But now it is.Welcome to Healingg.com!Healingg.com is a unique, global platform for sending and receiving healing prayers from people around the world - people who believe in helping others, and in doing good.So how does this work? Simple! Healingg.com provides 2 channels through which users can receive healing,Channel 1. Get healing/prayers through our community:Firstly, users can easily submit healing cases and start receiving prayers and distance healing from others around the world, at no cost. This is the channel through which majority of the healing is sent.This is a very effective channel because people across continents, regardless of 
their religious backgrounds, believe in prayers and their 
tremendous capacity to heal.  And when multiple people  send prayers to someone, the results are even more effective because these prayers carry the good intention of an entire community that believes in helping others.Channel 2. Get healing through professional Healers / Practitioners:Secondly, users can avail professional healing services through the healers / practitioners listed on our site.Healingg.com is a great place to search for alternative 
healers and practitioners across different healing modalities.  We bring together the whole gamut of global alternative healers under one roof, with exhaustive details about each of them, including client reviews and testimonials. This channel is for users who need 
professional healing.There is an ever-increasing belief in alternative healing therapies like Reiki, Pranic Healing, Yoga, Hypnotherapy, Meditation, Ayurveda etc. Over the last few decades, a growing number of people have started practicing these therapies, and even more people are claiming to benefit from them. With escalating costs of modern medicine and their unwanted side-effects, many people are now becoming more holistic in their approach to healing, and are turning towards alternative healing therapies.According to Global Industry Analysts, the global alternative medicine sector is expected to reach close to $115 billion by 2015,  This gives us a fair idea about the growing interest in alternative healing methods.                                                  (Image Credit: FreeDigitalPhotos.net and Twobee)A few years ago, we created a web app on Happiness called Revelri.com, where we included a small section on distance healing, called Synergy. But very frankly, this was just another section (out of the many we had), and we were not expecting much out it.Now, it so happened that as soon as we launched Revelri, Synergy became the most popular part of our website! Hundreds of people started posting their healing cases and thousands of people sent them healing. And so many people reported being healed. So it was only by this ""accident"" that we realized that people not only wanted to receive prayers, but they even wanted to pray for others whom they did not even know! We were pleasantly amazed to see such a strong desire to help, and get helped!Given below is a long screenshot of the ""healed"" section of Synergy. You can see the various kinds of healing cases that were submitted, and the number of people who sent their healing prayers (the number in the pink heart denotes the number of people who prayed).After realizing how much Synergy was helping our members, we became serious about getting it out to the world. We expanded our idea further, and gave Synergy a unique identity of it's own, in the form of Healingg.comWe launched Healingg.com a few months ago, and with very little promotion, we already have around 300 healers on board. Many members have submitted healing cases and have received healing from our existing community. And yes, people are benefiting from it. The testimonial we shared in the beginning of this page is an example.Since we have recently started, the numbers are low right now. But we know it is just a matter of time before more people come to know about us. Healingg.com is not something that we ""feel"" will help people. It is a tried and tested model. We have seen so many people benefit from Synergy. And we are sure we can replicate it on Healingg.com as well, with a much bigger and wider reach.The funds we receive from our campaign will primarily be used for the following:                        1.  Marketing (70% - About $10,500)The biggest work in front of us is to promote Healingg.com to a lot of people. We need to market it extensively to let people know that this is a great way to receive healing. Not just that, we also need to get more alternative practitioners on board, We plan to allocate about 70% of our funds for this. Broadly, the marketing funds will be used for:- Social media marketing- Email marketing - Print advertising - Traveling expenses 2. Improving our existing website (30% - About $4,500)About 30% of the funds will be used to improve the overall performance of our existing website (improve load-time, upgrade our server, improve design etc). We will need to hire one part-time developer for this.In case our campaign exceeds our funding goal, we will use the additional amount to ramp up our marketing endeavors. The more we can spend on marketing, the more people will we be able to help.We cannot stress enough how much your contribution will impact the world. Your contribution will help us reach out to many more people, so that they can heal all aspects of their lives.And who knows, in due course, Healingg.com might be the first place people would prefer going to for any kind of healing -  physical, emotional or spiritual. Ok, now, so a little bit about myself! My name is Abhishek Agarwal. I am married to my beautiful wife, Nam and we have a cute little 18-month old daughter, Mohi. Here is a pic of ours when Mohi was 1 year old.          Last year I got selected for Awesomeness Fest, a fast-growing movement where like-minded people come together to push humanity forward.Here is a photo of me with Lisa Nichols, a popular star from the blockbuster movie (and the book), The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne.My TeamApart from myself, I have my close friend Naveed, in my team. He is a top-notch techie and handles all our tech details, things that go over my head!  He is an awesome designer as well, a master strategist and comes up with some great ideas. He shares my vision, and has always been of tremendous help in all our ventures. I am happy to have him in my team.I also consider my wonderful family as part of my team. They have always been very supportive of my vision for making this a better world.Personally,
 I have a good amount of experience working online. - I have been a 
full-time Internet marketer for over a decade. - Ex-PowerSeller on eBay India, having sold over 14,000 products.- Over the years, I have created over 200
niche websites.- Built a subscriber-base of over 100,000 users. - Created Revelri.com that now has around 14,000 members. - I am also ranked as #3 in a list of over 400,000 expert authors on EzineArticles, the Internet's foremost article directory.http://ezinearticles.com/?type=expertsI absolutely loved what I did in my Internet marketing career. However, a 
couple of years ago, I had a strong calling to create something that would 
make a positive impact on our planet. Driven by this idea, we created 
Revelri, to spread happiness.  And now, we created Healingg, to spread more holistic ways of healing.Although I am not a professional healer, I have had several personal experiences in healing others and myself. I have also seen other healers do some amazing healing 'miracles'.  So, I have a strong, unshakeable belief in alternative healing. I know it works, and I 
am now driven by the idea of making it easy for others to experience it 
first-hand, so that they too can live a life full of joy, happiness and 
abundance. Through Healingg.com we want to make a positive change in the lives of people. We want to unify those who believe in doing good through prayers and healing... no matter what caste, creed or religion they belong to. And we need your help in doing that. So, please support us. And together, let's make this world a healthier and happier place.We do understand that not everyone who sees this page will contribute. That is absolutely all right :) But it will be great if you can spread the word and let people know about our campaign and what we want to achieve. That will be great support in itself!You can use the IndieGoGo tools to spread the word.",29.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You wouldn’t just run 23 miles and call it a marathon. You wouldn’t go to the gym and not know exactly how much you’re lifting.

<blockquote>
“I really tried to get into the habit of using a chest strap monitor, but the chafing always left me frustrated and eventually it just sat on my shelf. SenseON is totally different. When I train, SenseON does it’s thing, and I do mine. It’s obvious that is was designed with the ATHLETE in mind.” <br/> -<b>Alexis,</b> 31 - Triathlete 
</blockquote> <br/>
<blockquote>
“I’m a tech junkie and somewhat new to endurance sports. When I first started out, I tried nearly every major monitor on the market. I was surprised to find that they all seemed very ‘2004’ in their overall function and user-friendliness. So glad I found SenseON. It’s a powerful piece of hardware in a simple package.”  <br/> -<b>Jeff,</b> 43 - Age Grouper</blockquote>

That’s why we created SenseON, the first clinically accurate heart rate monitor that’s incredibly comfortable to wear. 

Connect with your body.
 
With a low profile design that flexes with your movements, SenseON will fit effortlessly into your daily routine.

View your progress.

Get meaningful feedback every time you workout. A comfortable all-day fit allows you to get valuable data like heart rate recovery.

Push your limits.

Knowing your boundaries means being able to avoid over or under training.  Do what you could not do yesterday.

Track your activity.

Get all of your fitness data in one place. SenseON tracks total steps, distance covered, calories burned, heart rate recovery, etc.


We knew there had to be another option. Since wristbands use LED light to detect your pulse, they require you to be absolutely still for optimal performance (meaning that when you need them, they don’t work). Chest strap monitors can be somewhat accurate, but they chafe, retain odor, need batteries replacements, and are flat out uncomfortable.


Connect SenseON with your preferred smartphone or fitness watch


Peel off the tape protector.



Find a dry area on the left side of your chest to adhere SenseON and then simply tap twice to activate it. 





HeBE ™ Sensing Electrodes
Made with 304 titanium plated stainless steel, these electrodes are highly conductive, resistant to erosion, and harmless to your body.


BiPA ™ TechnologyBy employing the latest BiPA ™ technology, SenseOn continuously captures the heart’s electrical pulses at an accuracy level of ±1 BPM (the same process used in medical EKG's). 

SenseON ™ TapeBy using specially designed medical grade tape, SenseOn can resist sweat and water, giving you the freedom to train like you always do. 

Cordless Charging
The portable charging case is SenseON’s home base. When you are done working out, simply put it back into the case and it will conveniently be charged for your next workout. The case delivers 8 full charges and each charge is good for 20 hours of continuous use.



“I really tried to get into the habit of using a chest strap monitor, but the chafing always left me frustrated and eventually it just sat on my shelf. SenseON is totally different. When I train, SenseON does it’s thing, and I do mine. It’s obvious that is was designed with the ATHLETE in mind.”  -Alexis, 31 - Triathlete 
 

“I’m a tech junkie and somewhat new to endurance sports. When I first started out, I tried nearly every major monitor on the market. I was surprised to find that they all seemed very ‘2004’ in their overall function and user-friendliness. So glad I found SenseON. It’s a powerful piece of hardware in a simple package.”   -Jeff, 43 - Age Grouper

















When can I select my color?
We'll send out a survey shortly after the campaign ends where we'll ask you for your color choice.

What is SenseON and how does it work?
SenseON is a water resistant, rechargeable, wearable device that adheres comfortably to your torso and continuously tracks your heart rate, physical activity, and other vital bio signals  – during activity, rest, recovery, and sleep. SenseON is applied to the left side of your torso, where a super-sensitive sensor captures a clear heart rate signal. It uses the industry standard Bluetooth 4.0 to continuously communicate with your mobile app of choice and display real time data and insights.
What does SenseON track?

Heart rate and heart rate zones
Breadth rate
Resting heart rate when worn while sleeping
Heart rate recovery
Steps
Distances
Calories burned
Sleep

How do I wear the SenseON?
SenseON is worn on the left side of the torso, under the left pectoral muscle.  For women, it should be positioned just below the sports bra.  To wear it, you will put a new adhesive on it, then simply remove the backing from the adhesive and press it firmly to your body (Just like a Band-Aid®).
How often should I replace my adhesives?
You should replace the adhesive with a new one each time you put SenseON on.
How much will the replacement adhesives cost?
3-6 month supply of adhesives(30 pieces) cost $6.99.
Is the battery rechargeable or does it need to be replaced?
SenseON comes with a cordless charging case. The rechargeable battery will last up to 20 hours per charge and take about 30 minutes to recharge. The charging case can charge SenseON 8 times before it needs to be recharged.
Can I swim with the SenseON in water?
You cannot track heart rate while swimming with SenseON, but SenseON is waterproof to IP67.
Is SenseON FDA approved?
No. SenseON is intended for consumer use only and is not a medical device.
Which devices are compatible with SenseON?
The SenseON can be used with Bluetooth 4.0 mobile devices such as smart phones and some sport watches.
Will SenseON work with my existing apps?
SenseON is compatible with fitness apps that support BlueTooth heart rate monitors, such as EndoMondo, Polar Beat and RunKeeper.

</p><p><strong>NEED OF THE PROJECT</strong> <br/>
Sensing that Medicare is the most important component of village life,
DEVELOPMENT <br/>
FORUM has proposed a unique project Mobile Medicare Unit. There are persons who are too vulnerable and old to visit hospital for treatment &amp; are too poor to afford it. It hence, becomes necessary to bring medical facilities at their doorsteps. <br/>
This tragedy of old age magnifies in proportion, if elderly person is financially poor. He not only faces neglect of family, but does not receive proper nutrition, medical facilities &amp; various things necessary in twilight years of life. Considering the size of population, who cannot afford medical treatment, this
number is a drop in ocean. Deployment ofMMCUs to various uncovered areas is a major challenge. <br/>
MMCU is highly potential project &amp; has the ability to penetrate deeper into the society. <br/></p><p>Since a social worker always accompanies MMCU, wide reaching effects can be created through <br/>
medical &amp; other kinds of care. This potential is yet to be realized. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT</strong> <br/>
1. To provide mobile health care services in Ankola Taluk by covering 50
villages where the basic access to health service is lacking. <br/></p><p>
2. Increase access to health care in an underserved area: The primary objective of the mobile clinic is to bring health care into a community with limited access,
specifically to those who are uninsured or under insured. <br/></p><p>
3.To ensure curative health care: To prescribe and dispense medicines on the
spot for the common ailments and referral to hospital for other cases. <br/></p><p>
4.To educate and build health awareness: To raise awareness about preventive health care issues including family planning, communicable and other diseases, audio visual equipment and a large screen will be fitted in the van. With the help of this
facility educational films can be shown in villages. <br/></p><p>
5.The clinic also integrates patients into existing social services and health care <br/>
systems through referrals</p><p>
6.To provides free episodic care at a time and place chosen to best serve our target <br/>
population. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY</strong> <br/>
It is proposed to run a Mobile medical care unit (MMCU) in form of a van to provide primary medical care to those, who due to age and poverty cannot approach regular doctors, in the targeted 50 backward villages. <br/>
Social worker associated with the MMCU will reach out to society by involving
the local community and organizes them for health care. Besides providing medical consultancy most of the medicines at practically no cost are also made available. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Mobile Medical Staff</strong> <br/>
ِِDoctor: A qualified M.B.B.S doctor will be appointed as Medical Officer for the
MMCU. <br/>
<br/>
Nurse: A qualified nurse (B.Sc./Diploma in Nursing)person would be appointed as nurse. <br/>
<br/>
Health Worker: The concerned person must have at least three years of work experience in the event of not being professionally qualified. <br/>
<br/>
Pharmacist: A qualified pharmacist would be appointed for drug distribution. <br/>
<br/>
Social Worker: An experienced social worker with at least three year of work experience will be appointed. <br/>
<br/>
Driver: A committed driver with a valid driving license will be appointed for
this post. <br/>
<br/>
At the end i would like to say that all of the employees are ready to work as
volunteers and all what we need is to build that mobile clinic and supply it by
needed instruments .<br/>

<h3>Our Story</h3>North County Roller Derby is the newest women's roller derby league in San Diego County.  The Cutthroat Cupcakes is our debut team!  We're training hard so that we can bring you some hard-hitting women's roller derby in 2012!  We formed in May of this year and have been growing steadily with new skaters joining every month.  Now, we need a home.  To date, all our practices have been held outdoors in local parks on rough, uneven  - not the safest surface for derby - not to mention that we can't always count on our practice location being available since these are public parks.  We need to have a permanent training facility where we can hold derby practices, work on off-skates training, and use as a bouting venue so you can come see us play!  We'd like to add a <a href=""http://www.icecourt.com/portable_skating_surface.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">SkateCourt derby track</a> to make our facility great!  This will give our skaters a much safer surface to skate on!<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We love roller derby and we want to introduce as many women to this sport as we can.  Having a dedicated practice facility would allow us to hold team practices several times a week and add some beginner derby classes as well.  We'd like to work with those who are completely new to skating &amp; let them give derby a try!  We think that roller derby is a great sport that builds confidence and is a fun way to exercise too!  If we don't secure a practice facility we may have to cut back our on-skates training for the winter months once it starts to get colder and dark earlier.  We would hate to do that, so help us out and we won't have to!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make all this happen we will need to raise $10,000.  That will give us enough to secure a facility and put a down payment on SkateCourt floor.  We have sponsors who will add additional funds and our members will pay monthly dues to keep things going.  Everyone who donates to our cause will  from us as a thank you!  We have stickers, t-shirts, VIP passes, and more!  We are a true DIY organization, so we've even designed and screen printed all the t-shirts and stickers ourselves!  If our goal is not met with this campaign, we will  to raise the funds until we have what we need to get our practice facility &amp; skate track.

<p>For anyone who knows Grumpy and me,
they know this is one of the hardest things to do. We talked, argued and finally decided to do it, to ask for help again. <br/></p><p>As most of you know back in
January Grumpy had an emergency colostomy. At that time I did humble myself and
ask for help. Help in the means of financials for those who could afford it and
for prayers. I will gladly accept the continued prayers. Both Grumpy and I are
still in awe with all of the financial help we received so I could stay at home
and take care of him, but I need two more months though.  <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/617866/files/20140601071901-CAM00108.jpg?1401632341"" src="""" style=""width: 173.509px; height: 230px;""/></p><span>  Grumpy
slipped out of his truck at work and ended up with a pretty black eye, bruised
ribs and a swollen arm/wrist/hand. He is out of work for who knows how long due to persistent pain in his ribs. I need to be around to drive him around to
his appointments and to keep him from doing what he should not be doing around
the house. I have an awesome lead for a work at home job; I just need a new
computer with the proper accessories to make it happen. I have enrolled for my
Masters degree online and am taking the extra money that I can get from the
loan since it is a low interest loan and the first installment will be sent to
me around the first week of July and then every 2-3 months for the next couple
of years. <br/></span>
<p><span>  Grumpy
is getting workman’s comp pay, but since he was only working part time to just
cover the benefits and child support, the 33% deduction that is not paid out is
really hurting us right now. We need $180 per week to pay for his benefits
leaving us just $40/week for child support/rent/food/utilities. </span></p>
<p><span>  So
basically, in short the story goes from an emergency colostomy in January, me
asking for help a couple weeks later, help was received, Grumpy went back to
work mid March, but only worked part time so the funds we raised in
January/February along with his tax return is now depleted. Thankfully Grumpy
does not have to have a reversal, but the cost of living with a colostomy is
not cheap, thankfully with his insurance the supplies are only around
$25/month, but his benefits cost $780/month. Take away his benefits the cost
would be about the same, but he would not have disability benefits from work
that he may be utilizing here soon due to his MG, not to mention health insurance for both
of us would be gone. </span></p>
<p><span>  We
both know that times are tough for everyone, but some are more fortunate than
others and just need to be asked in order to give a few dollars. We are asking
and know the day will come when where we can pass it forward, just as we have
in the past.</span></p><p><span>    You can also help by clicking like, share, create an Indiegogo account and leave a comment. It will help get the word out to people who might be able to help. <br/></span></p>

<p>SpeedForce's GPS works two ways: Turn-by-turn and Off-the-road. Turn-by-turn requires your smartphone's GPS. Your GPS sends the navigation via Bluetooth and SpeedForce will direct you that way. Off-the-road is when you pre-plan the route and push it to SpeedForce. Afterwards, even without your phone, SpeedForce will follow the submitted route.</p>

<p>When creating the prototype, we used 6061 series aluminum when creating SpeedForce in order to have excellent corrosion resistance, high tenacity and lightness.  SpeedForce was tested with 40kg of compression around 200,000 times to make sure it is safe for cycling. We forged SpeedForce with 3D integrated technology, 76 CNC process, and over 30 adjustments and testing to reduce the weight and make it the lightest aluminum possible.</p>
<p>As a final test to make sure it could handle any kind of ride and to ensure accuracy, SpeedForce has undergone drop tests and vibration tests over 200,000 times. It’s also IPX6 water-resistant. </p>Our next step is to make this product a reality.<p></p>

We created SpeedForce as a way to bring technology and cycling together in one place. SpeedForce is a fully integrated smart cycling computer that replaces your stem, combines different cycling products together, measures over 8 sets of data, and comes with an app.










“...touted as a means to improve the aptitude of bicycles... the device adds GPS navigation, smartphone charging and sensors on pedals and wheels to measure performance.” -USA Today
“Cyclists can track their bike performance, share their routes, and get motivated to continue biking. SpeedForce serves as a charger, too, which will keep you juiced up while riding.” - Mac World /IT World
“What sets SpeedForce's smart bike computer apart... is that it is durable and doesn't just mount onto your bike, but becomes part of the steering column, installing at the stem.” - CRN



The elegant, integrated design seamlessly incorporates a GPS cycling computer with a power supply, headlight, and navigation. It becomes the stem of your bike for a full integration rather than as an extra part.





SpeedForce has additional pedal and wheel sensors that ensure the highest accuracy. With each pedal, SpeedForce can pick up and calculate your riding data: speed, time, distance, track, heart rate, altitude, temperature, and cadence .


With a built-in GPS chip that syncs with your phone’s GPS, SpeedForce has turn signal indicators that light up to tell you where to turn next without needing to glance at your smartphone. It makes riding with navigation on safer and easier.




SpeedForce's GPS works two ways: Turn-by-turn and Off-the-road. Turn-by-turn requires your smartphone's GPS. Your GPS sends the navigation via Bluetooth and SpeedForce will direct you that way. Off-the-road is when you pre-plan the route and push it to SpeedForce. Afterwards, even without your phone, SpeedForce will follow the submitted route.

SpeedForce can operate up to 40 hours (16 hours with GPS navigation on). The removable battery offers more power options; just pack one more battery with you and SpeedForce will last through a long distance ride.


Keep your nightly rides safe by illuminating the path with more than 30 feet of light from Speedforce’s CREE headlight. It was built with a sleek design and has 150 lumens in order to focus a bright light on your path allowing for maximum visibility so nothing gets by you.



SpeedForce not only just reads the data, it interprets it for you. It tells you when to shift gears or when to pedal more so you get an optimal riding experience without putting additional strain to your body. It helps fix any bad cycling habits you may not know you have.
Even if your smartphone is in your pouch, you can still be alerted of important calls and messages. 


Employing state-of-art craftsmanship, we first used 3-D modeling to construct the ideal cycling accessory. SpeedForce has also undergone the drop test and vibration test over 200,000 times. We designed the cycling computer to be dust proof and water-resistant. We’ve also made two versions available: mountain bike and road bike, so it's tailored to the needs of both and fits perfectly as a stem.


A beautiful 1.6 inch color screen graces the SpeedForce for an easier reading of data. It’s visible whether you’re riding day or night. It has 8 different screens and can even give you phone and text notifications on it.

The app has been developed for two years now and has over 400,000 users who share and compete against each other. Make cycling into a lifestyle, not just a hobby!

Completely free app
View leaderboards - see who you’re doing better than
Meet new riders - don’t limit yourself locally, explore the world
City guides - there’s always a new route to be found
Cycling and training advice - great for beginners to learn their bike fit

 The data from SpeedForce can sync with our SpeedX app so you can access your data using your smartphone anytime instead of needing a computer. It also allows you to share your data with other users and see how others are doing as well. You can view a leaderboard and compete with others.


   

SpeedX has users all over the world, with this app, you are not alone. You can join bike clubs, chat in forums, and even share photos of trails you’ve been to. We want to encourage more people to be cyclists and this is the first step to do it.


No matter where you are, you can find a route using our app. Our app has different route suggestions based on your current location. You can ride new trails and have a new adventure each day.

As a beginner in cycling, you may feel lost. However, SpeedForce gives you the information you need to start. We have information ranging from bike fit to what types of bikes are available. That way, when you’re on a ride, you can be confident in knowing what you’re doing. 





We developed the prototype for over a year before we were satisfied with the results. We first started with a 3-D model to construct the ideal design and then used state-of-the-art craftsmanship to create the prototype. We were meticulous in creating a product cyclists would need and love to use. To make sure it’s an ideal fit, we made two models: MTB and Road.


                  


When creating the prototype, we used 6061 series aluminum when creating SpeedForce in order to have excellent corrosion resistance, high tenacity and lightness.  SpeedForce was tested with 40kg of compression around 200,000 times to make sure it is safe for cycling. We forged SpeedForce with 3D integrated technology, 76 CNC process, and over 30 adjustments and testing to reduce the weight and make it the lightest aluminum possible.
As a final test to make sure it could handle any kind of ride and to ensure accuracy, SpeedForce has undergone drop tests and vibration tests over 200,000 times. It’s also IPX6 water-resistant. Our next step is to make this product a reality.













We want more bikers on the road and we believe biking should be affordable. Our prices are even lower than the market price, and you get the same amazing features, if not, even more.





 







Our team comes from various career backgrounds, including the internet industry, hardware industry, professional cycling, and the strategy consulting industry, and we were all drawn together by a mutual passion in cycling.
SpeedForce uses superior design, first class technology and outstanding user experience to offer cyclists a new cycling experience. Our team has decades of expertise in bicycle research and development as well as design and with that experience comes SpeedForce.
