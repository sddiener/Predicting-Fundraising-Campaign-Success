<h2><strong>FAQs<br/></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. What type of keys are supported by Keyper?</strong></p>
<p>As Keyper is designed for common key types, most keys will fit Keyper. Keyper accomodates keys with a maximum length of 56mm.</p>
<p>If your current key does not fit, you can find a suitable key blank at your local hardware store and have it cut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Will the leather will expand over time, causing the keys to fall out?</strong></p>
<p>No, genuine leather and the design of stitching allows for the keys to be stored snuggly in the individual compartments. Leather may expand slightly over prolonged use, but expands to fit the shape of the keys, hence the keys will not fall out easily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. How long does it take for the item to arrive via international shipping?</strong></p>
<p>Shipping time varies for different countries, typically 10-14 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. What are the shipping charges?</strong></p>
<p>$10 for international shipping, local shipping is free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. Is the Keyper made from genuine leather?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is made from genuine calf leather, vegetable tanned and dyed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. What is the size of Keyper?</strong></p>
<p>Keyper is 94 x 61.5 mm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7. How do I choose the color that I want?</strong></p>
<p>Once the campaign is successful and we have finalized the color variation, we will contact each of you via email, regarding your choice of color. </p>

He remembered how wearing a Kevlar helmet in the Persian Gulf was actually cooler than not wearing one, and set out to determine how to duplicate the cooling effects of the helmet into his ball cap. After some trial and error he came up with a revolutionary design based upon the principles of flight aerodynamics that can be incorporated into any ball cap or hat with a curved bill. By adding a second smaller bill under the main bill of a cap and creating a gap from the front to the back between the two bills, the two bills create a curved shape that acts like an airfoil, thus creating a high and low pressure system that funnels and accelerates the free flow of air over a wearer's forehead, inducing a cooling effect. It works no matter which direction the wind is coming from, and even generates cooling air flow whenever a person moves. Besides the benefit of a cooling effect, the appearance of the ball cap is such that an observer looking at someone wearing it would not notice if there was anything overtly different about the design of the ball cap.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The photo's of the various caps shown here are regular ball caps in which we've incorporated the AIRCAP technology to showcase the effectiveness of the design. Why did the AIRCAP receive a US Patent? Because the gap does more than just allow cool air in; it ACCELERATES the flow of air between the bills and into the cap no matter which way the wind is blowing, using the principle of lift. It's one of those, ""why didn't I think of that"" products.</span></span><br/></p>
<p>The photos throughout this page demonstrate to potential manufacturers how the technology can be fitted to their own popular ball cap styles without altering the appearance of their products.  The AIRCAP shown above is a sample of what contributors will receive. This AIRCAP is in Special Forces Black.</p>
<p>It's the special insert that makes a regular ball cap an AIRCAP and we'd like to license (or sell) the AIRCAP technology to various manufacturers so they can contact their own ball cap suppliers to determine how best to incorporate the AIRCAP technology into their own designs.</p>
<p>The photos below show how we’ve incorporated the dual bill into normal ball caps to produce an AIRCAP. If you can help us launch this product by contributing and getting an AIRCAP, that we’ll manufacture just for this effort, and a little bit extra (all contained in the $49 and above perks) to cover operations, then you’ll have been part of the special effort that gets this product to market.</p>

<li>Funds will  be used to buy enough samples to market and showcase the product design to potential retailers for incorporation into their own designs and reward our investors.

<b>Perks:</b>
</li>
<li>Be in on the ground floor of the first major change to ball cap design since they were invented.  In the ""Perks"" section the differing amounts invested DO NOT correlate to the anticipated retail price of the AIRCAP, so while $49, for example, gets you an AIRCAP, that's a token of our thanks and not the retail price of the AIRCAP, which will be set by each vendor that purchases a license to produce them.

<li>With all products of this type the major risk is counterfeit products. While the AIRCAP has an issued US Patent, patents only mean something to people and companies that obey our laws.

<li>The AIRCAP technology is not an insert. Ball caps must be made with the technology incorporated, however, that isn't to say that an insert kit can't be made to retrofit a non-aircap ball cap into an AIRCAP. </li>
<li>The other challenge will be price points. Ballcaps come at all price points with high quality, major league and franchised ballcaps costing $75 or more. However, you can get a cheap ballcap with a plastic mesh screened back that costs less than $7 at any gas station. We envision that the AIRCAP will only be made to high quality standards, using premium materials and will target the higher quality ballcap market.

</div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","The AIRCAP Story


While jogging around his base, an Air Force officer kept arranging his ball cap to block the hot sun from his eyes and try to keep his head cool. He remembered how wearing a Kevlar helmet in the Persian Gulf was actually cooler than not wearing one, and set out to determine how to duplicate the cooling effects of the helmet into his ball cap. After some trial and error he came up with a revolutionary design based upon the principles of flight aerodynamics that can be incorporated into any ball cap or hat with a curved bill. By adding a second smaller bill under the main bill of a cap and creating a gap from the front to the back between the two bills, the two bills create a curved shape that acts like an airfoil, thus creating a high and low pressure system that funnels and accelerates the free flow of air over a wearer's forehead, inducing a cooling effect. It works no matter which direction the wind is coming from, and even generates cooling air flow whenever a person moves. Besides the benefit of a cooling effect, the appearance of the ball cap is such that an observer looking at someone wearing it would not notice if there was anything overtly different about the design of the ball cap. The end result?






The Amazing AIRCAP!!  A US Patent (US Patent 8,640,264; Cap which utilizes an airfoil effect for inducing cooling) and Trademark have already been issued for this incredible invention and prototypes have been hand produced.


The photo's of the various caps shown here are regular ball caps in which we've incorporated the AIRCAP technology to showcase the effectiveness of the design. Why did the AIRCAP receive a US Patent? Because the gap does more than just allow cool air in; it ACCELERATES the flow of air between the bills and into the cap no matter which way the wind is blowing, using the principle of lift. It's one of those, ""why didn't I think of that"" products.
The photos throughout this page demonstrate to potential manufacturers how the technology can be fitted to their own popular ball cap styles without altering the appearance of their products.  The AIRCAP shown above is a sample of what contributors will receive. This AIRCAP is in Special Forces Black.
It's the special insert that makes a regular ball cap an AIRCAP and we'd like to license (or sell) the AIRCAP technology to various manufacturers so they can contact their own ball cap suppliers to determine how best to incorporate the AIRCAP technology into their own designs.
The photos below show how we’ve incorporated the dual bill into normal ball caps to produce an AIRCAP. If you can help us launch this product by contributing and getting an AIRCAP, that we’ll manufacture just for this effort, and a little bit extra (all contained in the $49 and above perks) to cover operations, then you’ll have been part of the special effort that gets this product to market.
Please contribute TODAY!
                     
                     







By achieving our funding goal we can obtain production level prototypes, as well as, deliver AIRCAPS to our supporters. Plus, we'd have the operational funds required to visit a few potential retailers in the USA that may be interested in incorporating the AIRCAP design into their own line of ball caps (Cabelas, Gander Mountain, PING, Callaway, Nike, Bass Pro Shops, Under Armour, Independent large retailers, etc.).


Everyone on the planet has, at one time, worn a ball cap. They're international, and they're sentimental. They tell people who you are, where you've been, what you like, and what your passions are. They bring good memories to life - unlike cold electronic gadgets that fade away with time. Ball caps are timeless.

Time and time again you've probably lifted the bill slightly off of your head to get some cooling air flowing over your head, or your ballcap shows an ugly sweat stain across the front. This design alleviates almost all of that!

<p>To mark the final 7 days of the crowdfunding campaign coinciding with Fair Tuesday, 25% of purchases made from November 27th-December 2nd 2012, will be donated to sponsor orphans or severely at risk children in Rishikesh, India.</p>
<p>UNA Fashion is proud to be a partner of the Fair Tuesday initiative. The goal of #FairTuesday is to inspire conscious consumption and show how as a consumer, you have the power to create positive change! Find out more about the movement <a href=""http://www.fairtuesday.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a></p>
<p>Volunteering and spending time with several schools and orphanages throughout India was an eye opener for me. It also reinforced the belief that every child has a right to education and it is a vital tool for peace, development and freedom. The sponsorship will provide everything from proper nutrition (mostly from their own organic garden), healthcare, education, books and a home with a family of 60+ children full of compassion and love. </p>
<p><br/>Help UNA Fashion finish strong by making a pledge and sharing the campaign with your social networks, family and friends! 80% funded and only 6 days to go! I am overwhelmed and grateful for your continued support! Thank you!!!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Last winter I set out for India to bring my vision for UNA Fashion to life. </h2>
<p>My mission was to create a label where a purchase has a d<strong>irect and positive impact on people and our precious planet</strong>. A label that follows the principles of the <strong>slow fashion movement</strong>; to choose well and make it last. Therefor, a collection designed to be durable, timeless and functional. Lastly, a label to inspire the movement for <strong>conscious consumerism</strong>. Understanding that together, <strong>our power as consumer can change the world!</strong></p>
<p>I left for India not knowing exactly where my mission would take me. The past 7 months have been a whirlwind to bring UNA Fashion to where is it today. From finding the best eco-materials, artisans, and perfecting the designs; the journey has been challenging and immensely rewarding. <strong>Finally, the eco-leather bags and scarfs are ready for you!  </strong></p>
<p>Artisans in fair trade certified organizations craft the original designs. The groups have incredible missions beyond the World Trade Organization Fair Trade principles. They are tackling poverty and socials injustices by providing programs and support beyond employment.

<h2>kaj.ani Transition-Resort Capsule Collection</h2>
</div>
<h3>Beautiful &amp; Useful is what I aspire to when designing these clothes,  along with ethical manufacturing standards and quality materials. I aim for every piece to feel special &amp; to add beauty to your life. This has been a life long love and I've been practicing and honing my craft for many years. I want wearing these pieces to feel like lovely adventure. <strong>Every day you get a chance to invent yourself.</strong>
</h3>
<h3>                                                               <img alt=""Liberty Shirt close-up"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i334.photobucket.com/albums/m425/greenofkajani/Indigogo%20file/133ffabd-eb91-4ce0-a3f9-1ddbc8ed3636.jpg?t=1372526759"" src="""" style="""" title=""detail of Jeweled sleeve""/><strong>      </strong>
</h3>
<h3>With this ‘Transitional’ capsule collection we’re thinking a little outside the traditional, seasonal fashion box, What is currently being shown is ‘Resort’, so you can call this Resort if you like, but I think Transition makes more sense for today’s world. (okay, ‘Transition-Resort’ ;-)</h3>
<h3><strong>I wanted this collection to be both seasonless and seasonal, if that’s possible. Lifestyle, climate, where and how we live have a lot to do with how we dress. With this small group I hope to give you some versatile and beautiful pieces that you will enjoy wearing  when it’s warm, when it’s cool and in between. Casual, dressy or somewhere in the middle, it just has to work. Providing beauty, value, usefulness. Well-made, modern clothes with lovely details that are fun, pretty and practical.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>                                                   <img alt=""Liberty Mini-Dress close-up"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i334.photobucket.com/albums/m425/greenofkajani/Indigogo%20file/4745418a-e40b-4903-a3e1-232270fd39d2.jpg?t=1372526881"" src="""" style="""" title=""detail of Liberty Mini-dress""/><strong>  </strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>*The Images seen in the GALLERY section are from the ‘Transition’ collection, many of which represent the PERKS* we're offering.</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong> I believe good clothes serve you better and thus are more sustainable. These are not meant to be discarded seasonally or quickly replaced with the next trend,  but to be enjoyed for as long as you love wearing them.  Any new items purchased will just build upon the pieces that you love. It isn’t so much about fashion trends as it is about style that endures.  </strong>I have a love affair with good fabric; quality, luxury &amp; some practicality wrapped in a beautiful package is what I look for. L<strong>ife would be a bit sad without good coffee &amp; chocolate. The same goes for good clothes. </strong>
</h3>
<h2><strong>*Beauty is a necessity in life, that’s why beautiful is useful.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong> We make everything locally in Los Angeles. At the moment everything is done on a small scale – old-fashioned atelier style – no mass production, mostly limited edition. This is not easy in a mass-produced, super trendy, cheap labor, hyper PR fashion world,  but it is what I love to do.  I love the craft and the connection with people wearing what we’ve created.  While we aspire to greater success, more sales &amp; exposure, we intend to preserve the integrity of the product and continue strive toward ethical manufacturing standards. I really believe in the progress of small business entrepreneurs. I feel there’s a growing desire toward conscious commerce.  We feel good about knowing and connecting with where our stuff comes from and with the people that make it. It creates greater intimacy with the things we use.</strong></h3>

</h2></div>","kaj.ani Transition-Resort Capsule Collection

Beautiful & Useful is what I aspire to when designing these clothes,  along with ethical manufacturing standards and quality materials. I aim for every piece to feel special & to add beauty to your life. This has been a life long love and I've been practicing and honing my craft for many years. I want wearing these pieces to feel like lovely adventure. Every day you get a chance to invent yourself.

                                                                     

With this ‘Transitional’ capsule collection we’re thinking a little outside the traditional, seasonal fashion box, What is currently being shown is ‘Resort’, so you can call this Resort if you like, but I think Transition makes more sense for today’s world. (okay, ‘Transition-Resort’ ;-)
I wanted this collection to be both seasonless and seasonal, if that’s possible. Lifestyle, climate, where and how we live have a lot to do with how we dress. With this small group I hope to give you some versatile and beautiful pieces that you will enjoy wearing  when it’s warm, when it’s cool and in between. Casual, dressy or somewhere in the middle, it just has to work. Providing beauty, value, usefulness. Well-made, modern clothes with lovely details that are fun, pretty and practical.
                                                     
*The Images seen in the GALLERY section are from the ‘Transition’ collection, many of which represent the PERKS* we're offering.

 I believe good clothes serve you better and thus are more sustainable. These are not meant to be discarded seasonally or quickly replaced with the next trend,  but to be enjoyed for as long as you love wearing them.  Any new items purchased will just build upon the pieces that you love. It isn’t so much about fashion trends as it is about style that endures.  I have a love affair with good fabric; quality, luxury & some practicality wrapped in a beautiful package is what I look for. Life would be a bit sad without good coffee & chocolate. The same goes for good clothes. 

*Beauty is a necessity in life, that’s why beautiful is useful.
                                                                                     
 We make everything locally in Los Angeles. At the moment everything is done on a small scale – old-fashioned atelier style – no mass production, mostly limited edition. This is not easy in a mass-produced, super trendy, cheap labor, hyper PR fashion world,  but it is what I love to do.  I love the craft and the connection with people wearing what we’ve created.  While we aspire to greater success, more sales & exposure, we intend to preserve the integrity of the product and continue strive toward ethical manufacturing standards. I really believe in the progress of small business entrepreneurs. I feel there’s a growing desire toward conscious commerce.  We feel good about knowing and connecting with where our stuff comes from and with the people that make it. It creates greater intimacy with the things we use.
                                                                               

*kaj.ani was on hiatus for a while, we now bring it back with this collection.
 With your support we’ll be able to get this small collection produced & out to market, and create work for people.  We’ll also be able to get our Spring-Summer 2014 collection started and have the prototypes made. I am so grateful for your help in any capacity. Sharing this project with friends & on socail media is greatly appreciated.  Besides feeling good about helping us re-launch, to achieve our mission and put people to work, the other great perk is getting these clothes WHOLESALE!

<h2>Personal Style. Powerful Impact. </h2>
<p>Be a part of something bigger. Together, we can collectively challenge the $3+ trillion fashion industry to work more for human rights, workers' rights, sustainability, and positive impact in the lives of so many around the world.</p>
<h2>Our Why</h2>
<p>12+ million garment workers make the clothing we wear every day. Too often, these people are in unsafe conditions and grossly underpaid. Consider the shirt you have on right now - do you know who made it? Does she or he have a safe working environment or access to clean water? </p>
<h2>Join Us.  </h2>
<p>These questions inspired us to look for alternatives - and we’re thinking big. Join us in a movement to motivate the fashion industry to change. As wearwell connects more people to consciously-made clothing, the collective demand and buying power of conscious consumers grows.</p>

<h2>More On How It Works:</h2>
<p>Your wearwell experience starts when you tell us about the looks and the causes you love in your style profile. Are you preppy, edgy, boho-chic? Or looking for a little guidance on what’s in style right now?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483738190/rgfyt7d67dqexdbvns5u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And what do you care about most?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483738281/pbqpdsuzujec7wkrxxwf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p>We consider all of this - including your sizing + budget - and curate products just for you, shipping them straight to your door.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i63.tinypic.com/rvgg3p.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each piece is chosen from high-quality, fashion-forward lines that ""walk the talk"" when it comes to making an impact. Your box includes information on the positive social and environmental impact generated by your purchase.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i65.tinypic.com/xdb2x5.jpg%3E%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E%C2%A0%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EKeep%20what%20you%20want%20and%20send%20back%20what%20you%20don't.%20Simple.%20You'll%20only%20ever%20pay%20for%20the%20items%20you%20keep.%20Guaranteed.%C2%A0%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E%C2%A0%3C/p%3E%3Cp%20style="" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Keep what you love, send back what you don't. Simple. You'll only ever pay for the items you keep. Guaranteed. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i67.tinypic.com/14t3ddl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your pre-order code - once redeemed - covers the styling fee and shipping both ways. Even if you keep just one item from the box and we'll waive the fee for your next order! </p>
<h2>Our Process &amp; Criteria</h2>
<p>We search high and low for brands and suppliers that meet our standards for environmental and workers' rights. These standards were developed by us, the founders, while earning our Master's degrees at the American University School of International Service, and are based on research developed by leading global entities, including the ILO, Fair Trade USA, and Conservation International.  As wearwell grows, we will continue to monitor our standards alongside changes and advancements in the apparel industry to ensure that the brands we carry continue to meet our high expectations.</p>
<h2>How We'll Use Your Money </h2>
<p>Right now, we have a website built and ready to serve our backers. In order to market more widely and serve even more people, we will use the capital you are helping us to raise to build a site savvy enough to handle a higher volume of orders and enhance the experience for our initial backers + future customers. We also need to invest in human capital, hiring additional hands, talented stylists, and more.  </p>
<h2>Challenges &amp; Risks</h2>
<p>Finding the brands that we carry is challenging work, and unfortunately it's cost-prohibitive to fly to factories to check on working conditions and local environments. We are working with self-reported data from our suppliers. We pledge to be transparent and direct with our customers; we value your trust immensely.</p>
<p>Once you receive your pre-order code, you’ll create a profile and tell us all about your style and what you care about. From there, we’ll select specific items and you can expect a box within 4-6 weeks - a bit longer than we’ll take in the future. We are a startup and know that some hurdles are simply unpredictable in the early stages. But don’t worry; we’ll keep you updated every step of the way. We appreciate your patience!</p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>Together, <a href=""http://www.shopwearwell.com/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erin &amp; Emily</a> have over 15 years of experience in international development, global operations, marketing, sales, and communications. Erin is based in the US and Emily is based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia - the emerging hub for consciously-made apparel.</p>

<p>We wanted to buy our clothes from brands that do good for others and for the planet. But shopping consciously is a lot of work. Who has time to hunt down brands that suit your style, your budget, and what you care about?</p>
<p>We knew there had to be a better way. With our backgrounds in working for change around the globe, we decided to do something about it. </p>
<h2><strong>Be a Part of Something MUCH Bigger</strong></h2>
<p>In April 2013, the Rana Plaza Factory collapsed in Bangladesh, killing 1,000+ and injuring 2,400+, garnering international headlines about the practices of some of the US' and UK's largest clothing brands who were involved. But solutions to human rights and environmental challenges in the fashion industry are much more complicated than they seem and it's no single brand or company's fault. What's more, simply abandoning production in Bangladesh and countries with similar challenges would collapse economies, causing even deeper poverty. We are a long way from a conscious fashion industry, but we believe it can be done. (If you want to learn more, we recommend watching <a href=""http://truecostmovie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The True Cost</a> - available on Netflix.)</p>

</div><div> </div></div>","So How Does It Work? 

Tell us about your style, sizing, and the issues that you care about most.

We send you a variety of clothes from the latest cool + conscious brands that fit what you are looking for. Clothes that look good + do good, curated just for you by a personal stylist. 
 Keep what you love, return what you don’t. Finally! It's easy to choose clothes that reflect all of who you are.
Personal Style. Powerful Impact. 
Be a part of something bigger. Together, we can collectively challenge the $3+ trillion fashion industry to work more for human rights, workers' rights, sustainability, and positive impact in the lives of so many around the world.
Our Why
12+ million garment workers make the clothing we wear every day. Too often, these people are in unsafe conditions and grossly underpaid. Consider the shirt you have on right now - do you know who made it? Does she or he have a safe working environment or access to clean water? 
Join Us.  
These questions inspired us to look for alternatives - and we’re thinking big. Join us in a movement to motivate the fashion industry to change. As wearwell connects more people to consciously-made clothing, the collective demand and buying power of conscious consumers grows.

We envision a world where companies compete for customers not just on price but on their reputation for human rights and sustainability. This vision starts with you.
Choose a Perk →
If you select a perk that includes a pre-order, you’ll receive an exclusive pre-order code to join wearwell in the weeks shortly after the Indiegogo campaign closes. The code is your ticket into wearwell and covers our styling fee for your first order. Each time you keep an item from your order, we'll waive that fee next time. Please note: right now, wearwell can only serve customers with a mailing address in the US.

Why Choose wearwell? 
Wear your values...and be fashion-forward.
You care about the world and you care about the way you look. wearwell helps you to discover fashion-forward pieces that make you feel as great in your own skin as you do about where your money is going.
 
Look great and feel good.
Simply don’t know what to wear? Have our stylists refresh your wardrobe with clothes and accessories that inspire confidence - both in how you look and how you feel knowing that your purchase is making a difference in the lives of others. 

Discover new brands.
You want to shop consciously but don’t know where to begin. Let wearwell do all of the hard work for you. We’ll introduce you to new brands and styles and show you the impact that your purchase will have in communities across the world.

Be the ultimate conversation starter.
Headed to a party? Have a date? That compliment on how beautiful your shirt is doesn’t end at the visual. You have a story to share of the impact you helped to create.

More On How It Works:
Your wearwell experience starts when you tell us about the looks and the causes you love in your style profile. Are you preppy, edgy, boho-chic? Or looking for a little guidance on what’s in style right now?

And what do you care about most?
 We consider all of this - including your sizing + budget - and curate products just for you, shipping them straight to your door.

Each piece is chosen from high-quality, fashion-forward lines that ""walk the talk"" when it comes to making an impact. Your box includes information on the positive social and environmental impact generated by your purchase. 
Keep what you love, send back what you don't. Simple. You'll only ever pay for the items you keep. Guaranteed. 

Your pre-order code - once redeemed - covers the styling fee and shipping both ways. Even if you keep just one item from the box and we'll waive the fee for your next order! 
Our Process & Criteria
We search high and low for brands and suppliers that meet our standards for environmental and workers' rights. These standards were developed by us, the founders, while earning our Master's degrees at the American University School of International Service, and are based on research developed by leading global entities, including the ILO, Fair Trade USA, and Conservation International.  As wearwell grows, we will continue to monitor our standards alongside changes and advancements in the apparel industry to ensure that the brands we carry continue to meet our high expectations.
How We'll Use Your Money 
Right now, we have a website built and ready to serve our backers. In order to market more widely and serve even more people, we will use the capital you are helping us to raise to build a site savvy enough to handle a higher volume of orders and enhance the experience for our initial backers + future customers. We also need to invest in human capital, hiring additional hands, talented stylists, and more.  
Challenges & Risks
Finding the brands that we carry is challenging work, and unfortunately it's cost-prohibitive to fly to factories to check on working conditions and local environments. We are working with self-reported data from our suppliers. We pledge to be transparent and direct with our customers; we value your trust immensely.
Once you receive your pre-order code, you’ll create a profile and tell us all about your style and what you care about. From there, we’ll select specific items and you can expect a box within 4-6 weeks - a bit longer than we’ll take in the future. We are a startup and know that some hurdles are simply unpredictable in the early stages. But don’t worry; we’ll keep you updated every step of the way. We appreciate your patience!
The Team
Together, Erin & Emily have over 15 years of experience in international development, global operations, marketing, sales, and communications. Erin is based in the US and Emily is based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia - the emerging hub for consciously-made apparel.

We wanted to buy our clothes from brands that do good for others and for the planet. But shopping consciously is a lot of work. Who has time to hunt down brands that suit your style, your budget, and what you care about?
We knew there had to be a better way. With our backgrounds in working for change around the globe, we decided to do something about it. 
Be a Part of Something MUCH Bigger
In April 2013, the Rana Plaza Factory collapsed in Bangladesh, killing 1,000+ and injuring 2,400+, garnering international headlines about the practices of some of the US' and UK's largest clothing brands who were involved. But solutions to human rights and environmental challenges in the fashion industry are much more complicated than they seem and it's no single brand or company's fault. What's more, simply abandoning production in Bangladesh and countries with similar challenges would collapse economies, causing even deeper poverty. We are a long way from a conscious fashion industry, but we believe it can be done. (If you want to learn more, we recommend watching The True Cost - available on Netflix.)

When you fund wearwell, you’re beginning to solve the problem. By helping to build a service that allows people to easily find beautiful, quality clothes they can feel great about purchasing, you are collectively challenging the fashion industry to work more for human rights, sustainability, and improving the lives of so many people around the world.
Thanks for your support!
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't financially contribute, you can still be a part of the movement. Help us make some noise!
Here's exactly what you can do:

share the campaign over social (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, whatever works for you!) 
send an email with a link to your friends who you think will love wearwell 
connect us with people you think might be able to help by emailing info@shopwearwell.com. 
follow us on social media and sign up for our emails


We are so grateful. Thank you!
- Erin Houston & Emily Kenney, Co-Founders, wearwell

The brainchild of an enthusiastic young designer, fabricated by an aerospace engineer and finished by an artisan jeweler, the <i>Wõitleja </i>is the Estonian spirit distilled into a physical form. It is a permanent token of the resolve and ingenuity which a century ago helped a tiny nation beat back two invading empires, and today still helps it punch above its weight in freedom and innovation.</p><p>Limited to a run of no more than a hundred items, the <i>Wõitleja </i>(Estonian for Freedom Fighter) has been selected as part of the official celebrations of the Republic of Estonia’s centennial anniversary. <a href=""http://www.ev100.ee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R</a>ead More <a href=""https://ev100.ee/et/estonia-1918-woitleja-kaekellad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472215626/fk3zzvoim6ictxjhnhec.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>The History</h1><p>After eight centuries of continued occupation by foreign powers – first the Crusaders, then various colonial empires – Estonia declared itself an independent nation on February 24<sup>th</sup>, 1918. It was immediately attacked on two sides, by the Red Army of Soviet Russia, and by the German Empire’s Landeswehr.</p><p>Within two years, Estonian soldiers had beaten back both enemies, and secured their country’s independence. Estonia’s secret weapons were the Armored Trains – massive rail bound war machines that traveled fast and delivered overwhelming firepower.</p><p>The name <i>Wõitleja </i>initially belonged to the artillery car of Armored Train Nr. 2, and the watch’s design is directly inspired by the intricate workmanship of bronze gauges found on the heavy military equipment of the First World War era.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472214282/usefeppwutlrxzsctzub.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>The Look</h1><p>1918-era locomotives were festooned with bronze gauges, used to tell steam pressure and other vital parameters. These gauges had to be sturdy, but easy to read from a distance, through smoke, in the cab of a train running at full speed. Over time, the metal developed a beautiful patina that gives the items a distinguished masculine appearance. This was the inspiration for the <i>Wõitleja </i>by Estonia1918.</p><p>The timepiece is designed to be compact and thin, but look large on the wrist. Its case is machined whole from a single block of true old-school CuSn8 brass, a marine-grade alloy of brass and tin that was developed to be submerged in saltwater for a lifetime without corrosion. Exposed to skin and air, it will build up a unique patina that testifies to decades of faithful service.</p><p>The dial face, adorned by sword-shaped lumed hands and complemented by the brass indexes that form part of the case itself, is hand-crafted and covered in deep black enamel by an artisan jeweler from Roman Tavast, the same person who creates Estonia’s decorations of state – including the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, the highest honor that can be awarded to non-Estonians for outstanding service to the country’s independence.</p><p>The dial face is covered by sapphire crystal, and sapphire is also used in the waterproof exhibition caseback that both protects and presents the specially embellished Swiss movement. With a 44mm diameter and a height of only 11mm, the thin bezels, enamel dial and machined indexes combine to generate a three-dimensional legibility that enable you to easily tell the time at a glance, from a distance.</p><p>The watch comes with a selection of military-inspired straps, but will take the owner’s choice of standard 24mm strap, in cloth, leather, or metal that are attached to the watch case with strong screwdown strapbars. Each watch carries a unique serial number between 1 and 100, with number 1 reserved for the watch to be given to the President of Estonia.</p><h2>The Perks</h2><p><strong>1 out of 100 Wõitleja Wristwatch</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472215456/wr3nlmtflysty6sjcoqf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Estonian Coat of Arms Pinion for the strap or to be worn separately</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472215478/wodmnyjwlohnipdco520.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h1>The Technology</h1><p> </p><p>The watch designer’s extensive IT experience came in handy in Estonia’s famously tight-knit digital community, known in Silicon Valley as the Estonian Mafia. For the machining of the bronze case and the final assembly of this limited-run centennial timepiece, he drafted in aerospace engineers who spend their days building satellites.</p><p>The <i>Wõitleja </i>was intended to look as large as possible on the wrist, while maintaining a reasonable physical size. As a military-style watch, it also needed to be practical, which meant serviceable by any competent watchmaker around the world. Despite a broad choice of available movements, only one fit all the criteria: an upgraded variant of the Swiss-made Unitas 6497-2. This more precise and more durable version beats at 3Hz, has 19 jewels instead of the usual 17, and its matte gold plating can be admired through the transparent sapphire caseback. The watch is held together by titanium screws in extruded pods, with hex heads instead of the more classic phillips, to give a subtle clue to future generations that this timepiece was actually made in 2016, not 1918.</p><p>The dial fabrication process starts by making a die in a CNC machine. The machine engraves the letters “ESTONIA” onto the mold with a precision of 1 micron. Then the die is taken to a press that stamps out the base of the dial, already lettered and curved at the edges. Pure enamel powder (essentially tiny glass particles) that has been washed several times is added to the base of dial, fired at temperatures of over 800 degrees Celsius. At that point, the powder liquefies and fuses to the base of the dial. Once cooled, the process is repeated with the next layer of enamel powder. Altogether, between five and ten coats are applied to produce the desired color and thickness.</p><p>When the firing is finished, the enamel is polished to a mirror finish. The entire dial creation process is incredibly time-consuming, even for an enameller with over twenty years of experience. Enamel gives the dial an extremely deep black color that will never fade. Since the enamel dials are known as the most durable dial types in the history of watchmaking, this centennial anniversary timepiece will easily last for another 100 years.</p><ul>

The watch had to be related to Estonia, the Estonian War of Independence, and the country’s approaching 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary. It also had to be made in Estonia. The target market he had in mind were people of Estonian heritage around the world, who remain true patriots of their country and would appreciate a piece of history that they can keep on them at all times. The watch had to remind them of where they came from, and what made their legacy possible. The <i>Wõitleja</i> is not just for those who live in Estonia, but for those whose roots and hearts remain in the tiny North European country. It is also for the many dearly appreciated friends of Estonia, whether they be compassionate statesmen, ambitious and innovative e-residents, or just tourists who found Estonia’s beautiful nature to be a respite for their soul.</p><p>The design process started by diving into the history of the beginning – years 1918-1939. Tõnis found many interesting stories about how it was possible for such a small country to win simultaneous wars against Soviet Russia and Germany; he wanted to see and feel what the people who lived during this period felt. The most inspiring parts were the ones involving Armored Trains, the crucial secret weapons for defeating both enemies. In one of the books, he noticed a picture of an artillery car named <i>Wõitleja</i>, an archaic spelling of the Estonian word for freedom fighter. This word has the special letter Õ, unpronounceable in English, the same letter as in Tõnis’s name. At that moment, the name of the watch was decided.</p><p>To hear Tõnis tell the tale:</p><p>“I am a 32-year-old IT professional, currently holding a management position in a large multinational corporation. I am also a life-long timepiece enthusiast. I remember liking them since I was six, when I had the opportunity to play with my grandfather’s vintage watches. Even at that age, I knew enough to treat them with great respect.</p><p>I have worn a wristwatch ever since, and have gone through numerous different models. My first one was, of course, the classic Casio F91-W. Some years back, I got my first automatic Tag Heuer, which is when the real collecting started. Currently, I own over 20 watches of different makes and styles. My latest acquisition is a Zenith Pilot 20 in bronze.</p><p>This Zenith actually served as the greatest inspiration while I was designing my own watch. Before I decided to design a complete timepiece, I created several dial designs on paper and in Photoshop. I modified the watches in my collection – changed their dials, hands, straps, brushed and polished them, and did some movement upgrades.</p><p>The design started on paper, and soon moved to 3D thanks to the help of my friends Tago Kalbri and Jürgen Aleksejev. The first version of the watch that was 3D-printed was large, very large. It was made to look like an armored part of a train or a tank. Soon after making the first prototype and showing it to my friends and family, I understood that it is simply too big. I had to pick a smaller size and stick to it. Having a relatively large wrist, I wanted to make it look good on me. The optimal size of the watches I pick for my own collection is 44mm. It is not so small that it will be invisible or illegible, and not too big for wearing all day. The principle of designing a watch that looks large but is comfortable to wear with long sleeves affected the Wõitleja a lot. If you need to make a watch that wears large but is actually not too big, you have only one choice: make the dial as big as possible. To maximize the dial size while sticking to the 44mm limit, I had to give it a very thin bezel. I also wanted the watch to be as thin as possible, no more than 11mm with the caseback. Pretty much all wristwatches have the same layers: crystal, hands, dial, movement, O-ring, and caseback. To minimize thickness, you need to go with either a thin crystal, a thin movement, or a thin caseback.</p><p>My first attempt was to go with a thin movement, the ETA2892. This looked weird inside the large-diameter case, and I did not like the look of the third hand. If you are looking for a large-diameter, thin, commonly serviceable movement from Switzerland, there is really only one choice: the Unitas 6497.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472216326/whbd7wglzl2gv0dm8q6n.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>With the movement selected, I had to fit it inside the case, along with the O-ring that makes it waterproof. First, I tried a screwdown caseback, but it took up too much space inside the watch, and would have made it thicker.

The brainchild of an enthusiastic young designer, fabricated by an aerospace engineer and finished by an artisan jeweler, the Wõitleja is the Estonian spirit distilled into a physical form. It is a permanent token of the resolve and ingenuity which a century ago helped a tiny nation beat back two invading empires, and today still helps it punch above its weight in freedom and innovation.Limited to a run of no more than a hundred items, the Wõitleja (Estonian for Freedom Fighter) has been selected as part of the official celebrations of the Republic of Estonia’s centennial anniversary. Read More HereThe HistoryAfter eight centuries of continued occupation by foreign powers – first the Crusaders, then various colonial empires – Estonia declared itself an independent nation on February 24th, 1918. It was immediately attacked on two sides, by the Red Army of Soviet Russia, and by the German Empire’s Landeswehr.Within two years, Estonian soldiers had beaten back both enemies, and secured their country’s independence. Estonia’s secret weapons were the Armored Trains – massive rail bound war machines that traveled fast and delivered overwhelming firepower.The name Wõitleja initially belonged to the artillery car of Armored Train Nr. 2, and the watch’s design is directly inspired by the intricate workmanship of bronze gauges found on the heavy military equipment of the First World War era.The Look1918-era locomotives were festooned with bronze gauges, used to tell steam pressure and other vital parameters. These gauges had to be sturdy, but easy to read from a distance, through smoke, in the cab of a train running at full speed. Over time, the metal developed a beautiful patina that gives the items a distinguished masculine appearance. This was the inspiration for the Wõitleja by Estonia1918.The timepiece is designed to be compact and thin, but look large on the wrist. Its case is machined whole from a single block of true old-school CuSn8 brass, a marine-grade alloy of brass and tin that was developed to be submerged in saltwater for a lifetime without corrosion. Exposed to skin and air, it will build up a unique patina that testifies to decades of faithful service.The dial face, adorned by sword-shaped lumed hands and complemented by the brass indexes that form part of the case itself, is hand-crafted and covered in deep black enamel by an artisan jeweler from Roman Tavast, the same person who creates Estonia’s decorations of state – including the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, the highest honor that can be awarded to non-Estonians for outstanding service to the country’s independence.The dial face is covered by sapphire crystal, and sapphire is also used in the waterproof exhibition caseback that both protects and presents the specially embellished Swiss movement. With a 44mm diameter and a height of only 11mm, the thin bezels, enamel dial and machined indexes combine to generate a three-dimensional legibility that enable you to easily tell the time at a glance, from a distance.The watch comes with a selection of military-inspired straps, but will take the owner’s choice of standard 24mm strap, in cloth, leather, or metal that are attached to the watch case with strong screwdown strapbars. Each watch carries a unique serial number between 1 and 100, with number 1 reserved for the watch to be given to the President of Estonia.The Perks1 out of 100 Wõitleja WristwatchEstonian Coat of Arms Pinion for the strap or to be worn separately The Technology The watch designer’s extensive IT experience came in handy in Estonia’s famously tight-knit digital community, known in Silicon Valley as the Estonian Mafia. For the machining of the bronze case and the final assembly of this limited-run centennial timepiece, he drafted in aerospace engineers who spend their days building satellites.The Wõitleja was intended to look as large as possible on the wrist, while maintaining a reasonable physical size. As a military-style watch, it also needed to be practical, which meant serviceable by any competent watchmaker around the world. Despite a broad choice of available movements, only one fit all the criteria: an upgraded variant of the Swiss-made Unitas 6497-2. This more precise and more durable version beats at 3Hz, has 19 jewels instead of the usual 17, and its matte gold plating can be admired through the transparent sapphire caseback. The watch is held together by titanium screws in extruded pods, with hex heads instead of the more classic phillips, to give a subtle clue to future generations that this timepiece was actually made in 2016, not 1918.The dial fabrication process starts by making a die in a CNC machine. The machine engraves the letters “ESTONIA” onto the mold with a precision of 1 micron. Then the die is taken to a press that stamps out the base of the dial, already lettered and curved at the edges. Pure enamel powder (essentially tiny glass particles) that has been washed several times is added to the base of dial, fired at temperatures of over 800 degrees Celsius. At that point, the powder liquefies and fuses to the base of the dial. Once cooled, the process is repeated with the next layer of enamel powder. Altogether, between five and ten coats are applied to produce the desired color and thickness.When the firing is finished, the enamel is polished to a mirror finish. The entire dial creation process is incredibly time-consuming, even for an enameller with over twenty years of experience. Enamel gives the dial an extremely deep black color that will never fade. Since the enamel dials are known as the most durable dial types in the history of watchmaking, this centennial anniversary timepiece will easily last for another 100 years.

The JourneyWhen he started designing the watch about 2 years ago, Tõnis Leissoo set out a few firm design principles. The watch had to be related to Estonia, the Estonian War of Independence, and the country’s approaching 100th anniversary. It also had to be made in Estonia. The target market he had in mind were people of Estonian heritage around the world, who remain true patriots of their country and would appreciate a piece of history that they can keep on them at all times. The watch had to remind them of where they came from, and what made their legacy possible. The Wõitleja is not just for those who live in Estonia, but for those whose roots and hearts remain in the tiny North European country. It is also for the many dearly appreciated friends of Estonia, whether they be compassionate statesmen, ambitious and innovative e-residents, or just tourists who found Estonia’s beautiful nature to be a respite for their soul.The design process started by diving into the history of the beginning – years 1918-1939. Tõnis found many interesting stories about how it was possible for such a small country to win simultaneous wars against Soviet Russia and Germany; he wanted to see and feel what the people who lived during this period felt. The most inspiring parts were the ones involving Armored Trains, the crucial secret weapons for defeating both enemies. In one of the books, he noticed a picture of an artillery car named Wõitleja, an archaic spelling of the Estonian word for freedom fighter. This word has the special letter Õ, unpronounceable in English, the same letter as in Tõnis’s name. At that moment, the name of the watch was decided.To hear Tõnis tell the tale:“I am a 32-year-old IT professional, currently holding a management position in a large multinational corporation. I am also a life-long timepiece enthusiast. I remember liking them since I was six, when I had the opportunity to play with my grandfather’s vintage watches. Even at that age, I knew enough to treat them with great respect.I have worn a wristwatch ever since, and have gone through numerous different models. My first one was, of course, the classic Casio F91-W. Some years back, I got my first automatic Tag Heuer, which is when the real collecting started. Currently, I own over 20 watches of different makes and styles. My latest acquisition is a Zenith Pilot 20 in bronze.This Zenith actually served as the greatest inspiration while I was designing my own watch. Before I decided to design a complete timepiece, I created several dial designs on paper and in Photoshop. I modified the watches in my collection – changed their dials, hands, straps, brushed and polished them, and did some movement upgrades.The design started on paper, and soon moved to 3D thanks to the help of my friends Tago Kalbri and Jürgen Aleksejev. The first version of the watch that was 3D-printed was large, very large. It was made to look like an armored part of a train or a tank. Soon after making the first prototype and showing it to my friends and family, I understood that it is simply too big. I had to pick a smaller size and stick to it. Having a relatively large wrist, I wanted to make it look good on me. The optimal size of the watches I pick for my own collection is 44mm. It is not so small that it will be invisible or illegible, and not too big for wearing all day. The principle of designing a watch that looks large but is comfortable to wear with long sleeves affected the Wõitleja a lot. If you need to make a watch that wears large but is actually not too big, you have only one choice: make the dial as big as possible. To maximize the dial size while sticking to the 44mm limit, I had to give it a very thin bezel. I also wanted the watch to be as thin as possible, no more than 11mm with the caseback. Pretty much all wristwatches have the same layers: crystal, hands, dial, movement, O-ring, and caseback. To minimize thickness, you need to go with either a thin crystal, a thin movement, or a thin caseback.My first attempt was to go with a thin movement, the ETA2892. This looked weird inside the large-diameter case, and I did not like the look of the third hand. If you are looking for a large-diameter, thin, commonly serviceable movement from Switzerland, there is really only one choice: the Unitas 6497.With the movement selected, I had to fit it inside the case, along with the O-ring that makes it waterproof. First, I tried a screwdown caseback, but it took up too much space inside the watch, and would have made it thicker. I played around with the design for months, and finally got the idea of moving the screws that keep the watch together to the outside – just like on military equipment gauges. The screws had to be top-down, to complement the masculine, military style. I chose to go with machined titanium 6AL4V hex screws. Hex, not Philips, because this watch is made in 2016: it needs a hint that while it looks vintage, it is actually new.With all the pieces together, the final design looked so obviously right that I was surprised it took me so long to come up with it. That is the thing about beautiful simplicity – everyone thinks they could have come up with the same solution, but they did not.The PurchaseThe watch is available now, to be built to order with a specially embellished Unitas 6497-2 movement (900€). A leather NATO strap or a matching canvas strap is included. Expected lead time is 2-3 months. The estimated retail price after the campaign is 1200€All parts of the Estonia1918 Wõitleja watch are finished by hand, so there may be some imperfections, just as there are with hand-crafted jewelry. The patina on each timepiece will also develop differently, depending on the environment in which it is worn, how much it is touched by hands, and many other factors. It will not be even, and it will not be perfect, but that is part of the design of the Wõitleja. Like the country of Estonia, it is not perfect – but for us Estonians, it is the best of its kind in the world.Media PublicationsArticle in a local Estonian NewspaperInterview with the authorReview of the watchCoverage in Roman Tavast blogFeatured at Watchuseek.com",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487899668/iijtam4lprr3pf17xw58.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Thermal images showing the specific eyelid area that is heated during treatment. The skin warms to a comfortable, constant, optimal temperature. Just ten minutes a day will yield long term benefits!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>The Heated Eye Pad is for everyone: computer users, frequent travelers, contact wearers, and all ages of adults. Avoid and prevent digital eye strain by taking care of your eyes with our simple wearable!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How do you use it?</h3>
<p>The Heated Eye Pad is as simple as a pair of glasses. After plugging it in (with its USB cord/power supply), the warming elements on the device heat up immediately. Just close your eyes and put it on, making sure that the golden eyelid warming elements are positioned over your upper eyelids.</p>
<p>While wearing your device, it's best to sit or lay down. Get comfy! Listen to music or a podcast during your 10-15 minutes a day.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Digital eye strain, dry eye, or other irritating eye conditions develop due to many of the same reasons. Your eyelid contains glands with oils that help your eyes produce tears, moisturize, and maintain overall eye health. Due to stress, aging, eye strain, and other factors, these oils can get trapped in the glands of your eyes. The Heated Eye Pad releases these oils, ultimately relieving you of dry, tired eyes!</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>John got the idea for the Heated Eye Pad after struggling with dry eye problems for years. Living in a desert environment and spending way too much time in front of a computer only made his eye problems worse. Physicians all advised the use of a warm compress, but it just wasn’t good enough – warm compresses that were available on the market couldn’t sustain a constant temperature, and they were always a mess and a lot of hassle to warm up. John was sick of heating up wet rags and buying multiple disposable compresses.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, John developed a chalazion on his eye that became so enflamed, it needed to be surgically excised. The problem now? The excision was incomplete and his eye problems were even further exacerbated. His doctor tried injecting a steroid into his eyelid, but when that failed to dissolve, he passed John’s case over to an in-house plastic surgeon. The surgeon’s procedure on John’s eye became infected and now an even more aggressive surgery needed to be performed to clean everything up. These procedures left John with a divot in his eyelid, multiple destroyed meibomian glands, and heavy scar tissue around his eye.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What advice did John’s doctors give him now that he had so many physical issues with his eyes? Simple – they still recommended a warm compress. The answer was ALWAYS a warm compress, but John knew there had to be a better way to deliver the treatment. And so, the Heated Eye Pad was born. John was desperate for a real long-term solution to keep up with preventative treatment for his eyes so he invented the first and only no-mess digitally heated eye compress – the Heated Eye Pad. The best part? It didn’t just help John avoid dry eye and chalazion recurrence. Instead, the Heated Eye Pad had a use for EVERYONE who sought out healthy, refreshed eyes.</p>

<p>MODUCO (MODern Urban COmpany) is the collaborative vision of two good friends and former roommates; one an American watch designer, the other a Swiss watch brand &amp; product manager with a combined experience of more than 10 years in the watch industry.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520123633/b1g7z4urw7hjknxz6qiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have set out to design a watch inspired by the urban environment, modern aesthetics and industrial elements that finely juxtaposes boldness with simplicity and rawness with sophistication.</p>

<p>The concept of the MODUCO timepiece was originally conceived during our time in Miami Florida as roommates and co-workers. What started us on our journey was our passion for watch design which initially landed us both at a company in the fashion watch industry; an industry full of possibilities, but ultimately over saturated with monotonous designs seen many times over. Our dream was to utilize our combined experience of over 10 years in the watch industry and create something of our own, something meaningful, powerful and unique.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520123536/dugmjmdikdfukyiqlc3e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since our days in South Florida and our initial concept phase, we have separated; one left for New York and continued design operations, while the other went back to his home country of Switzerland to begin generating relationships with manufactures and to lead the development process.</p>

<li><p>Both in our early thirties. </p></li>
<li><p>Worked for watch companies in Switzerland, U.S. and Hong-Kong.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed and developed watches from $50 up to $100,000.</p></li>

<p>MODUCO's most eye catching and unique feature is its distinct cylindrical bezel and case back that erupts through the case body and draws inspiration from raw industrial piping. It is finely balanced with a combination of traditional finishing techniques interpreted in fresh new ways.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520123238/axc9yluucgoipvpbvysb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The top of the bezel is diagonally brushed which adds interest and assists in creating depth and a sense of perspective. This is contrasted with heavy vertical brushing on the bezel side. These two planes are broken by a highly polished chamfer that beautifully captures and reflects light.</p>

MODUCO (MODern Urban COmpany) is the collaborative vision of two good friends and former roommates; one an American watch designer, the other a Swiss watch brand & product manager with a combined experience of more than 10 years in the watch industry.

We have set out to design a watch inspired by the urban environment, modern aesthetics and industrial elements that finely juxtaposes boldness with simplicity and rawness with sophistication.
 

The concept of the MODUCO timepiece was originally conceived during our time in Miami Florida as roommates and co-workers. What started us on our journey was our passion for watch design which initially landed us both at a company in the fashion watch industry; an industry full of possibilities, but ultimately over saturated with monotonous designs seen many times over. Our dream was to utilize our combined experience of over 10 years in the watch industry and create something of our own, something meaningful, powerful and unique.

Since our days in South Florida and our initial concept phase, we have separated; one left for New York and continued design operations, while the other went back to his home country of Switzerland to begin generating relationships with manufactures and to lead the development process.

Us in a few words : 

One is an American who currently lives in New York. The other is a Swiss who is now based in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.  
Both in our early thirties. 
Worked for watch companies in Switzerland, U.S. and Hong-Kong.
Designed and developed watches from $50 up to $100,000.
Accomplished in creating new watch collections (from concept to final product) for well known fashion and luxury brands. 
Combined experience of over 10 years.

 


Our case is defined by the interplay of several elements derived from our inspiration: 

raw and industrial
dimensional play of height and depth 
modern and minimal

This criteria coupled with meticulous execution of contrasting details creates a look that is powerful, yet sophisticated and uncluttered. 

 


MODUCO's most eye catching and unique feature is its distinct cylindrical bezel and case back that erupts through the case body and draws inspiration from raw industrial piping. It is finely balanced with a combination of traditional finishing techniques interpreted in fresh new ways.
The top of the bezel is diagonally brushed which adds interest and assists in creating depth and a sense of perspective. This is contrasted with heavy vertical brushing on the bezel side. These two planes are broken by a highly polished chamfer that beautifully captures and reflects light.

The case body is sculpted with clean architectural lines and completed with a subtle sandblast finish to contrast the industrial rawness of the cylinder bezel.


 

The crown plays in harmony with the bezel and displays heavy vertical brushing on the side of the cylinder and the top which is separated by a notched chamfer to provide a firm grip for setting the watch.

 

UPDATE: All backers can upgrade to the ""Lume dial"" for $25.This new dial features a black matte upper-layer, Tritec C1 Super-Luminova lower-layer and XII ceramic applied with C1 Tritec Super-Luminova powder.

Dimension drives the design, from the striking cylinder bezel to the sandwich construction dial consisting of a matte top dial with cut-out hour indexes that exposes the sunray lacquered dial below.

This dimensional push/pull effect is completed by the heavy vertical brushed Roman numeral XII ascending from the surface of the dial like a city skyline.

 

Our modern heavy brushed skeleton hands add to the dimensional effect created by the sandwich dial and high rise index and will utilize Tritec Luminova C1 for easy visibility in low light.

 

We will be offering two Swiss Made movements (both quartz and automatic) to power our unique case style. 

UPDATE: Free movement upgrade for all backers

For the automatic we will be partnering with Sellita, a successful leader in the watch industry, and utilizing their SW200 movement with 26 jewels, a calendar at the 3 o'clock position and a 38 hour running time. We chose the élaboré grade with incabloc shock absorber. 

(Prototype Only - The final movement will feature a custom engraved rotor with the brand name)
The automatic version will boast a heavy diagonal brushed, screw down exhibition case back with acid etched markings.


We have chosen to team with Ronda for our quartz edition, a company with over 70 years of watch making experience, and will be employing their very reliable and precise 513 caliber.

The quartz edition case back will feature a heavy diagonal brushed, screw down case back with acid etched logo and markings.

 

The modern lifestyle offers a variety of opportunities and interactions, from work to play, each day. 
Each watch purchased will come with a 100% vegetable tanned Italian calf leather strap that is pre-selected for each coloration, but you will also be allowed to choose an additional strap option of either a Nato strap or stainless steel mesh bracelet (additional $20). 
All straps will come with easy quick release pin levers for easy changeability, so you may further customize your watch to suit your mood and occasion .

(Add $20 to your contribution and swap one of the straps for a premium quality 316L stainless steel mesh band with brushed finishing and quick release spring bar)

You can now also choose from the textile cordura straps (at no extra cost). Add a technical look to your selection by choosing the black or green cordura. Both of them come with leather lining. 

 

Holding true to our desire to create every detail with purpose, the MODUCO 305 watch will be delivered in a book-closure style luxury box that is slim, easy to store and even travel with, so that your watch will always be protected when not worn.

(Dimensions: 280mm x 130mm x 20mm)
Our box will exhibit:

a magnetic lid closure
soft touch lamination paper for the cover
silver vertical brushed paper around the inner carton
spot UV gloss treated logo with diagonal brushing effect, reminiscent of the bezel top
and high density premium protective foam with cutouts for the watch, additional strap and warranty card for ultimate protection.

 


 

MODUCO prides itself on quality and the execution of fine details. Bringing you a uniquely crafted 'Swiss Made' watch at an affordable price point that cuts out the middleman and additional markups is our goal. 

Our watches are designed in the USA and will be developed and hand assembled in the region of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Jura, Bienne and Solothurn in Switzerland with some of the finest partners in the industry.
 

By supporting our campaign, you will be given the option to chose from our pre-designed collection. 
Our Sellita SW200 automatic edition (305A) will be offered at a limited quantity of 305 pieces, while our quartz (305Q) will be offered at an unlimited quantity.

After completion of the campaign, each backer will be sent an order form via email. You will receive one order form for each purchase made to choose your:

additional strap option
This form must be returned to us to place your order and begin manufacturing on a timely schedule.

With our 10 years of combined experience in the watch industry and with one of our co-founders stationed in Switzerland who has built strong relationships with some of the top Swiss manufacturers, we feel confident that we have greatly minimized these risks.
We have spent 3 years meticulously crafting this timepiece down to the finest detail and with tried and tested prototypes gaining excellent reviews from bloggers and influencers abroad, we are confident in its quality. 
It is our goal to be completely transparent with our backers, keeping them informed every step along the journey of manufacturing.  We will be providing photos and videos of this process from manufacturing to delivery.
If along the way, we find that there is a setback in production, or a delay somewhere during the process in the timeline, we will be transparent and keep all of our backers informed. If our campaign is successful, we are targeting a shipping window in mid to late August. 
We desire to provide our backer with the best customer service and encourage our backers to feel comfortable to reach out to us at any moment to ask questions and we pledge to get back to you within 24 hours.
Thank you for backing MODUCO!

<p><strong>THE MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Sugar Patrol Clothing is on a mission to inspire others to create change.  Let's transform dreams into reality.  We promote perseverance, fortitude, wellness, education, and love!  </p>
<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>In 2003, I was 100lbs over weight, struggling with my career, and living alone; I needed to change, so I moved back to my home town on the beach.  I bought an old ski boat to become more active.  It represented a new beginning for me.  I was looking for my passion and purpose; I was looking for my sugar!  My best friend and I decided to name the boat Sugar Patrol!  We thought, ""we should create T-shirts that say Sugar Patrol to wear on the boat.""  The idea was born. </p>
<p>As time passed, the idea evolved; I imagined there were four women from different eras who had owned the boat before me. Each had the same dreams, desires, and struggles.  They were all just looking for their sugar! So, now I am telling their stories to encourage others! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sugarpatrolclothing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/sugarpatrolclothing/</a></p>
<p><strong>THE LADIES OF SP</strong></p>
<p>To create the art for the T-shirts, I enlisted the help of designer and amazing artist, Melissa Taylor <a href=""http://katastrophicclothing.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://katastrophicclothing.com/about/</a>  It took us 8 months to get the ladies just right.  Melissa worked tirelessly to capture my exact ideas using her flare.  The results were beautiful.  The Ladies of Sugar Patrol want to share their stories to motivate others. Through them, I want to fund and fuel women to create solutions that matter.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475441717/wihvmdqviajxxnyzej49.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The vision for Sugar Patrol’s future is to inspire more women by representing other cultures and their style influences.  If we fund more than the $20,000 needed, we can start on the next four Sugar Patrol Ladies.  Welcome Aboard! Be a part of the Sugar Patrol!</p>

<p>I decided that each Sugar Patrol Lady should have their own line of clothing inspired by their era and unique body style.  I started small with just T shirts.  We are nearing the final prototype.  We have posted pictures of the models wearing the shirts.  They are not quite the finished product, but for the most part they will be what you receive.  (SHIRT SIZES COME IN XS, S, M, XL)</p>

Our shoes will keep you comfy from your morning commute to happy hour drinks, look as good with your date-night outfit as they do with your comfy sweats, and will last longer than Nicolas Cage's acting career. And dammit, they look cool. We love the PA1 because they are...    We keep telling you that we made a plant shoe, but what does that mean, exactly?  If you're nerdy like us and want to know more, here are all the details on each material.  Our latex and cotton insole provides all day support and comfort! See for yourself:   Take a look at how our shoes are made. Spoiler alert: it's not a bunch of magic elves, and it doesn't happen at the North Pole. 
    We have an amazing team of craftsmen and -women working with us in Portugal. Why Portugal?

Cork is a key ingredient in our shoe and over 45% of the world's cork is grown in Southern Portugal. The best know-how on working with cork is also there.
There is a long heritage of making high-quality footwear in and around Porto, where there are over 300 shoe factories.
We can be certain that everyone who works on a pair of Scoots is treated fairly and is paid a living wage. Dave spent a whole month in our factories to make sure.
Portugal is strategically located right on the water, which allows us to easily ship our shoes to just about anywhere in the world. We also wouldn't mind some beach vacations.
   It's important to us to leave as small of an environmental footprint as possible. We accomplish this not only by responsibly sourcing our materials, but also by properly disposing of our shoes once you are done wearing them.  We believe that we need to both minimize our negative effects and maximize our positive contributions to the environment.

With a total height of 10MM and a weight of 59 grams (with a nylon strap), it feels good on the wrist. </p><p>Protecting the face of the watch, you'll find scratch resistant sapphire glass.

<p>We carried the military theme right over to our packaging with a rustic wooden military crate. Inside each crate, two MS1 watches will sit, nestled on a burlap pillow. That’s right - each package will contain two watches - in two different color finishes with interchangeable NATO straps. So whether combat ready, in dress blues or civies, the MS1 allows you to style your timepiece according to your wardrobe. </p>

</div></div>","You'll get not just one, but TWO high quality Seiko powered Chronograph watches, a unique military crate watch box, a limited edition serial numbered dog tag and 2 extra watch straps.  Perhaps the major highlight, and what we’re most proud to announce, is our plans for the future of the MS1 Military Watch Set. Once we're fully funded, we're planning on keeping the production running so that we can sell the MS1 Military Watch Set in participating retail stores and through our website.A 20% of the net proceeds from the sales of this watch set will be donated to help various veterans causes - mainly to aid wounded military veterans as well as those suffering from PTSD. Some of the organizations we'll work with do great work like suicide prevention, providing supplemental health care as well as career counseling. We also have some ideas on how to get our backer community involved. This is a worthy cause that deserves more attention and we’re proud to do our small part.   With its simple lines, clean dials and vintage looks, the MS1 was designed and developed over a period of 8 months. What you see now is the final result of many experiments with movements and components to bring you a refined, high quality watch at a price that can't be refused.  You get both watches as part of the set: The MS1 was built to be the following: 

Tough - Built solid, with high quality materials to get you through all the messy situations.

Reliable - With a trusted movement that can be powered for 3 years on one battery.

Minimal - A vintage look and feel inspired by mission critical military aircraft instruments.

Functional - An easy-to-view date function and chronograph seamlessly integrated into the design.

Value - Get a lot for a little. Having no middlemen allows us to build you premium timepieces for a minimal cost.
 To ensure a sturdy build, we had to use stainless steel to forge the MS1 casing. With a thin bezel around the watch, we thought a 42mm diameter case (measured w/o the crown) would be the perfect size for any wrist. It's not oversized if you have a smaller wrist, and it's definitely not too small if your wrist is larger. With a total height of 10MM and a weight of 59 grams (with a nylon strap), it feels good on the wrist. Protecting the face of the watch, you'll find scratch resistant sapphire glass. Coupled with the stainless steel case and backing, the combination gives this watch a water resistance of 5ATM which will be fine under water during showers and swims.  Powering the MS1 Watch Collection is the Seiko (TMI) VD51 Japanese quartz movement. It has a minute, hour and second hand, as well as a date function at the 3PM location. The date window has been carefully cut to ensure it can be read easily - no need to squint as you check to see what day it is. An added bonus to the Seiko VD51 is the chronograph function which has two dials to measure seconds and minutes. These are activated and reset by two pushers located on opposite sides of the crown. The movement can be powered up to 3 years on one battery (Sony battery included).  To complete the vintage military look on the MS1, we added a NATO style strap. These 22MM wide straps are made out of ballistic nylon, have stainless steel hardware and can be removed with little effort - no tools required. The MS1 Watch Set comes with 2 additional NATO straps and 2 additional ZULU style straps to give you a nice combination of colors / looks. All straps in the following pictures are included in the watch set: See just how easy it is to switch straps:


 
 


We carried the military theme right over to our packaging with a rustic wooden military crate. Inside each crate, two MS1 watches will sit, nestled on a burlap pillow. That’s right - each package will contain two watches - in two different color finishes with interchangeable NATO straps. So whether combat ready, in dress blues or civies, the MS1 allows you to style your timepiece according to your wardrobe. 



 

Each MS1 Military Watch Set comes with a special embossed dog tag. This dog tag has a serial number that is unique to each watch set, it indicates the production run/series, the production year and the watch number. 

 
 


 
 

 
 


THE MS1 MILITARY WATCH SET:

Each MS1 Watch Set includes the following: 

MS1 Chronograph Watch in black/black with black NATO watch strap
MS1 Chronograph Watch in silver/white with army green NATO watch strap

Military dog tag with unique serial number
Extra red/white/blue striped NATO watch strap (""The Patriot)

<h1><strong>      Welcome to Rapture!</strong></h1>
<p>Have you ever wanted to go to a cosplay event but not had a costume to wear, and the only available ones are those companies in china? </p>
<p>Have you ever looked for a Cosplay or Lolita dress pattern and been unable to find a suitable size, good instruction, or availability in your area?</p>
<p>Have you ever suffered from Simplicity patterns, which promise great things, but have no guidelines and often end up being an awful fit in the wrong fabric? </p>
<p>Well Rapture Costumiers is here to bridge the gap.</p>
<h2><strong>The Blurb</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Hayley Morris and I am 25 and just finishing uni. This indigogo even will finish just in time for the end of uni where i can throw my full attention into this job. I am smart, a nerd, excellent with computers and eager to merge computers and fashion together.I also apologise in advance for my video, I am not a media student but felt it would be honest to put a video together for you.    </p>
<p>This project is important to me because it means in the future i may be able to sustain myself in a business, it will be the groundwork for my future, it will allow me to put my heart and soul into creating something wonderful for people to use and buy cheaply from me without the normal hassle associated with sewing clothes. </p>
<p>By helping me, you will define a need in an industry that people have long since forgotten. You will prove that people WANT to make things themselves, that there is an area long too ignored. This is the fact that women are wearing the wrong sized clothes or they just can't get clothes in their size. Plus sizes in different body shapes are ignored, too wide on the hips- you must be 6 foot tall, aren't you? Didn't think so.</p>

<h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
<p>The project I propose is to make my University collection ""Renaissance Lolita"" into digitised patterns by using auto cad or a similar programme. This will enable the consumer to purchase a pattern pack from me for £10 which will include 1 garment pattern in sizes 8-22 with instructions on how to put the dress  together and how to alter the pattern for the perfect fit for yourself if need be. The dresses use a lot of smocking and instructions for this will also be included if you wish to smock or pipe any sections of the dresses. It will also have suggestions of fabric types and ideas for making the dresses more individual to yourselves. Each pack will have a list of measurements for each pattern in centimetres and inches so you can choose the best fit. Custom patterns can be made on request at a slightly higher price and larger sizes can be whipped up on request at a later date. </p>
<p>The dress patterns will be in PDF format, to the correct size, so that you can print them on A4 sheets from your home printer. You line them up, selotape or masking tape together, cut out, use, abuse and throw away when you're done because they will be right there in your pc waiting for you. If you lose your pattern file make sure you either put your email in a safe folder in your account or just drop me an email and I will resend you the file. You bought it, you own it DRM free. No passwords, no hassle. </p>
<p>Scroll down for images of the collection and more information.</p>
<h2>What will the money go on?</h2>
<p>-A licensed legal version of Progecad to make all my patterns legal to distribute. £250</p>
<p>-A license for Xara designer pro, a programme similar to illustrator but considerably cheaper. £250</p>
<p>-Most of the money will buy 'time'. I currently work part time at ASDA. The wages pay rent to my grandmother which we would not afford to eat without and also to pay off some debt. This will not change and your money will provide security that will enabe me to work on this project 4 days of the week and will allow me to be the best that I can be.</p>
<p>Without your pledges I will have to work full time at ASDA and this will make the process last longer. I would like to get the groundworks and first project completed so that I can make more projects that the public want. The more money, the more time to make what you want. In the long run i would like to be able to sustain myself on my business and eventually make one off pieces for those who want to buy a garment rather than a pattern.</p>
<p>$3000 is roughly £1700, after buying the 2 programmes, £1200 will be enough to last 3 months of living. Roughly the same amount I have available for a semester at uni.</p>
<p>If you pledge just $10 you get 1 pattern pack, and $40 gets you all 4. In comparison to english money it means you are getting the packs for around £6 each. I want to be able to work hard to achieve this well before December so I can then move on to other Lolita garments, and costume items. I am happy to also design androgynous costumes, for example- a mans outfit for a woman.   Think of your pledge as a pre purchase of the pattern packs. You will get exactly the same quality of item that will be available on my website for a cheaper price. </p>
<p>Even if the goal isn't met I will use the money to at least buy the programmes I need and this project will happen, just over a longer period.</p>

<h1>ABOUT ""Renaissance Lolita""</h1>
<p>By this point you're probably wondering about the dresses, or you've scrolled down because you want to know about the dresses first. </p>
<p>My collection is based Lolita style clothes which, if you don't know, are normally ultra cute dresses or trouser suits based on Victorian design. So tight bodices, full perfect frilly skirts. It comes from Japan and is originally based on alice in wonderland. I chose to create a new category of Lolita garments called Renaissance Lolita. Using research from paintings of famous renaissance figures, and games such as Assassins creed and Deus Ex (futuristic renaissance) I decided to concentrate my project on smocking, piping and ruffs, whist keeping the traditional Lolita silhouette.</p>
<p>This project is 100% my work, my copyright. All dress patterns that made up the dresses are designed by me, the dresses were made by me. </p>
<p>The 4 dresses in my collection are divided into two dresses with double skirts and 2 dresses with single. Each dress displays its' own individual characteristics. </p>
<p>Bianca - A dress with a wide neckline with no sleeves. It has a kirtle style split  skirt and hand smocked waist.</p>
<p>Vittoria- A single skirted dress with pleated symettrical detail down the front. It has shirred sleeves in a smocked fashion with a lozenge smocked back panel.</p>
<p>Caterina- A double skirted dress with firm piped waist, faux shoulder straps, mutton sleeves and hand stitched honey comb smock cuffs.</p>
<p>Lucrezia- A high ruff neck with pleat pressed front and lower edge frill. It has lattice detail on the back.</p>
<p>The dresses are priced quite high because of the amount of hand sewing involved. Caterina alone is £350 because of the amount of hours put into the hand stitched sleeves and piped waist. I do not believe people should have to buy my dress from me fully made. Having a choice between the ready made product and the pattern should be available to people. Imagine going into a designer store, you can't afford the £200 shirt but they have the pattern. You buy it for £20 get your own fabrics and make it the way you want in a perfect fit. This is how the future should be, we should have a choice in how we wear our clothes and where we get them from. if you make a beautiful product you'll be more likely to keep it in your wardrobe and not feel so bad about dismantling it and reusing the fabrics if you want to. In the long run this could cut down a lot of consumer waist and create some brand new fashion designers ready to self publish themselves. </p>
<h1><strong>MAKING the pattern: What's Involved!</strong></h1>
<p>To make a garment pattern you always start with a block. The first task will be to design the garment blocks in CAD using the smallest size. Then each pattern piece is manipulated into the shapes required, so whether you turn a dart into a seam, hike the skirt up, make it longer, fan it out, move the waist line, move the dart, shorten the sleeve, puff the sleeve...etc, I'm sure there are more things you can do to a pattern. </p>
<p>Once the patterns are set you add seam allowance, cut them out of fabric and test the size and shape of your lines. If any alterations are needed you take notes and apply them into the programme. Then you grade up the pattern into all the other sizes and add on seam allowance, or vice versa. All patterns are then cut out and tested. In this case it's probably easier to make the largest then unpick and keep using the smaller pattern piece. The largest size must also be tested for consistency to make sure the grading is correct. This obviously takes a lot of time to make sure you are getting the best deal for your $10.</p>
<p>Eight toiles (mockups) minimum must be tested before the patterns are finalised. They will then be made into separate PDF files so you may choose which size and use less ink in the printing process. These will be 8,10,12,16,18,20 and 22 (UK sizing) Measurements supplied.</p>
<p>This is obviously a lot of work and it must be complete x4. That's essentially 32 mock ups and all of it takes time. </p>
<p>Copyright information: Costume and dress shapes come under utilitarian by law. This means the shapes cannot be copyrighted. Only graphics and fabrics are copyrightable. This means, although patterns will be unofficial and by no means endorsed by the anime or video game companies, they will be legal for you to buy and use as dress patterns are merely fabric shapes. </p>
<h1>Other ways you can help!</h1>
<p>If you can't contribute, no worries, help me get the word out, help me advertise around the net, try and get it on kotaku (along the lines of Kotaku East/meets west), tell people you know on facebook or twitter, on your blog, anywhere you can think. Pass it on to women who sew, women who design, curvy ladies, otaku's, cosplay addicts, video gamers. Anyone you know. Send me a message to let me know how you advertised so I can thank you personally. Remember you can use the indigogo sharing tools.</p>
<h1>The Future</h1>
<p>In the future I am hoping Rapture Costumiers will turn into the go to place for Corset patterns, Lolita patterns, Cosplay patterns, dresses, jackets, period tops and skirts etc. I hope it will supply a new ability in people who will be more willing to make themselves clothing and be less scared of the first hurdle.I know it has put me off in the past. I hope that through my future patterns it creates a new standard in pattern cutting for beginners and hobbyists and hope that those that pledge for me will join me on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rapturecostumiers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> to help me choose which projects I make in future.</p>
<p>I have every intention in the future of setting up a database where other people can submit their pattern designs for sale where I take a small profit of 5-10% and people can sell their cosplay patterns etc through the same website. Anyone interested in the web design aspect or submitting their patterns in the future or just plain interest, please email me at hvmorris23@ymail.com</p>
<p>Please also visit my other links down the bottom of the page. These will show you past uni projects I undertook, also linkedin for my background and CV, and my own website as well, which will, in future, home the pattern shop.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for reading!</strong></p>

Even if the goal isn't met I will use the money to at least buy the programmes I need and this project will happen, just over a longer period.

ABOUT ""Renaissance Lolita""
By this point you're probably wondering about the dresses, or you've scrolled down because you want to know about the dresses first. 
My collection is based Lolita style clothes which, if you don't know, are normally ultra cute dresses or trouser suits based on Victorian design. So tight bodices, full perfect frilly skirts. It comes from Japan and is originally based on alice in wonderland. I chose to create a new category of Lolita garments called Renaissance Lolita. Using research from paintings of famous renaissance figures, and games such as Assassins creed and Deus Ex (futuristic renaissance) I decided to concentrate my project on smocking, piping and ruffs, whist keeping the traditional Lolita silhouette.
This project is 100% my work, my copyright. All dress patterns that made up the dresses are designed by me, the dresses were made by me. 
The 4 dresses in my collection are divided into two dresses with double skirts and 2 dresses with single. Each dress displays its' own individual characteristics. 
Bianca - A dress with a wide neckline with no sleeves. It has a kirtle style split  skirt and hand smocked waist.
Vittoria- A single skirted dress with pleated symettrical detail down the front. It has shirred sleeves in a smocked fashion with a lozenge smocked back panel.
Caterina- A double skirted dress with firm piped waist, faux shoulder straps, mutton sleeves and hand stitched honey comb smock cuffs.
Lucrezia- A high ruff neck with pleat pressed front and lower edge frill. It has lattice detail on the back.
The dresses are priced quite high because of the amount of hand sewing involved. Caterina alone is £350 because of the amount of hours put into the hand stitched sleeves and piped waist. I do not believe people should have to buy my dress from me fully made. Having a choice between the ready made product and the pattern should be available to people. Imagine going into a designer store, you can't afford the £200 shirt but they have the pattern. You buy it for £20 get your own fabrics and make it the way you want in a perfect fit. This is how the future should be, we should have a choice in how we wear our clothes and where we get them from. if you make a beautiful product you'll be more likely to keep it in your wardrobe and not feel so bad about dismantling it and reusing the fabrics if you want to. In the long run this could cut down a lot of consumer waist and create some brand new fashion designers ready to self publish themselves. 
MAKING the pattern: What's Involved!
To make a garment pattern you always start with a block. The first task will be to design the garment blocks in CAD using the smallest size. Then each pattern piece is manipulated into the shapes required, so whether you turn a dart into a seam, hike the skirt up, make it longer, fan it out, move the waist line, move the dart, shorten the sleeve, puff the sleeve...etc, I'm sure there are more things you can do to a pattern. 
Once the patterns are set you add seam allowance, cut them out of fabric and test the size and shape of your lines. If any alterations are needed you take notes and apply them into the programme. Then you grade up the pattern into all the other sizes and add on seam allowance, or vice versa. All patterns are then cut out and tested. In this case it's probably easier to make the largest then unpick and keep using the smaller pattern piece. The largest size must also be tested for consistency to make sure the grading is correct. This obviously takes a lot of time to make sure you are getting the best deal for your $10.
Eight toiles (mockups) minimum must be tested before the patterns are finalised. They will then be made into separate PDF files so you may choose which size and use less ink in the printing process. These will be 8,10,12,16,18,20 and 22 (UK sizing) Measurements supplied.
This is obviously a lot of work and it must be complete x4. That's essentially 32 mock ups and all of it takes time. 
Copyright information: Costume and dress shapes come under utilitarian by law. This means the shapes cannot be copyrighted. Only graphics and fabrics are copyrightable. This means, although patterns will be unofficial and by no means endorsed by the anime or video game companies, they will be legal for you to buy and use as dress patterns are merely fabric shapes. 
Other ways you can help!
If you can't contribute, no worries, help me get the word out, help me advertise around the net, try and get it on kotaku (along the lines of Kotaku East/meets west), tell people you know on facebook or twitter, on your blog, anywhere you can think. Pass it on to women who sew, women who design, curvy ladies, otaku's, cosplay addicts, video gamers. Anyone you know. Send me a message to let me know how you advertised so I can thank you personally. Remember you can use the indigogo sharing tools.
The Future
In the future I am hoping Rapture Costumiers will turn into the go to place for Corset patterns, Lolita patterns, Cosplay patterns, dresses, jackets, period tops and skirts etc. I hope it will supply a new ability in people who will be more willing to make themselves clothing and be less scared of the first hurdle.I know it has put me off in the past. I hope that through my future patterns it creates a new standard in pattern cutting for beginners and hobbyists and hope that those that pledge for me will join me on facebook to help me choose which projects I make in future.
I have every intention in the future of setting up a database where other people can submit their pattern designs for sale where I take a small profit of 5-10% and people can sell their cosplay patterns etc through the same website. Anyone interested in the web design aspect or submitting their patterns in the future or just plain interest, please email me at hvmorris23@ymail.com
Please also visit my other links down the bottom of the page. These will show you past uni projects I undertook, also linkedin for my background and CV, and my own website as well, which will, in future, home the pattern shop.

<p>My name is Shen Cook and I am 15 years old. I have lived in Athens my entire life and I love it here. Luckily, Athens has a youth hockey program, so I fell in love with ice hockey when I was 9. When I was 12, I became interested in goaltending and that's what I have done ever since then. Unfortunately, this is the most expensive position as far as equipment goes. All of my leg pads and gloves have been hand-me-downs. My current set of leg pads are too small and leave part of my legs exposed. Puck to the leg = Pain. If I can't raise the money for another set, I'm afraid it could very well mean that I won't be playing hockey this season. This would set me a step behind everyone else in the future, making the rest of my varsity hockey experience more difficult than it should be.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The leg pads I want will cost about $480 (that's cheap for leg pads). If I can raise more funds than that I will use them to buy a new stick or a face cage, or perhaps both. My stick is getting too short which can be hard on the back due to leaning over too far, and my cage is badly rusted.</p>
<p>It only takes a $25 donation to receive a perk! Check them out below. If you can't donate that much, even $5 or $10 will make a huge difference.</p>
</div>
<div>Like I said earlier, getting these pads before hockey starts up again is very important to me. If I can't get them, it will likely end my life of hockey. Any help you can give would be much appreciated.</div>

Furthermore, we observed that the group next to us was having a blast and drawing a lot of attention by attempting simple smoking tricks such as blowing a smoke ring. We noticed that two of the four members in the group could produce 1 or 2 rings per attempt, and there was a cheer every time one was successfully produced.

The original idea behind Monkey O's was inspired by a scene in Jim Carrey's 1994 hit film The Mask. In this particular scene Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) was in the park trying to seduce a young woman. His efforts included inhaling a substantial amount of smoke from his cigarette and then blowing out a smoke heart with an arrow going through it. The woman was not only mesmerized by this simple smoke shape but she was wildly entertained by its uniqueness, as were we. 
 
A few days later we decided to accompany a group of friends to a local hookah lounge. What we observed was truly what sparked the creation of Monkey O's. We observed that the atmosphere in this hookah lounge and the few others that we had been to allows for parties to drink, smoke hookah, converse, and not much else. Furthermore, we observed that the group next to us was having a blast and drawing a lot of attention by attempting simple smoking tricks such as blowing a smoke ring. We noticed that two of the four members in the group could produce 1 or 2 rings per attempt, and there was a cheer every time one was successfully produced. The remaining two were attempting to learn how to blow their own rings, and even though their attempts were unsuccessful, it was very evident that they were having a great time trying.
After witnessing this, we were determined to find a very simple product that could help even the most amateur of smokers achieve this added dynamic of fun and entertainment by assisting them in blowing smoke rings. 
PROTOTYPES
After hitting the drawing board, we were able to mold some prototypes out of modeling clay and bring them to a local glass blower for production.


After our first few attempts at a working prototype were finished, we were able to approach an engineer to help us refine our design to make it more effective. After producing dozens of more prototypes, all different dimensions, we were able to pinpoint the design that worked more consistently than the rest. 

We created over 50 hand glass blown models
Now that we had our product, the next step was to educate the user on how to effectively use it. Instead of designing a model that would produce a perfect O ring in every attempt, we chose a model that would allow the user to become more efficient at producing the rings with practice. We felt that this small learning curve would add a fun challenge to the users experience allowing them to stay interested and engaged in our product.
We have plans for product expansion that include a new ""Double-Barrel"" feature for the MONKEY O. This item will simultaneously shoot out 2 rings from the product. This prototype is currently in production as well. 
SCIENCE
We found that the most efficient way to produce the rings was to control our breathing while simultaneously making sounds such as ""ooh..ooh...ahh...ahh"" originating from the diaphragm. After experimenting with the product for some time, we realized that the ""ooh..ooh...ahh...ahh"" sounds that we were making sounded a lot like the sounds that monkeys make...and just like that we found the perfect name for our company: Monkey O's!


MULTI-FUNCTIONAL
While testing the product, we were able to discover that with a few modifications, our product could be used not only for blowing smoke rings, but also to blow smoke bubbles! Yes, that's correct, our product is now a 2 in 1 design! The possibilities and fun are endless with the 2 in 1 Monkey O!

In order to help alleviate this risk, we have made it a point to use only the highest quality glass and glass production techniques.Our biggest challenge is going to be reaching economies of scale in order to help drive our material and production costs as low as possible. Hand glass blowing is very labor and time intensive, and raw materials are always cheaper in bulk orders. Acquiring the capital to reach a cost effective pricing point will allow us to kickstart production and offer our product to consumers at the lowest price possible! We have aligned a plethora of avenues that can jumpstart the wholesale ordering (shops, hookah lounges) that will in turn drive the cost down per product.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Background</h3> <p>Hello! My name is Davis and all my life I've had a passion for technology. I was often involved in projects such as building computers or making apps. I also really love honey bees! I have two bee hives, they are my pride and joy. I never thought these two passions could collide. One day, I was at the beach on cnet.com looking at smart watches and I realized just how un-user friendly they were. I decided I could create a smart watch that was easier to use and more efficient than all the cumbersome smart watches out at the time. That's when I had a vision! I saw a smart watch that used a tessellation of seven hexagons to put information right at a user's fingertips. After many hours of research and google sketchup renderings, Comb720 was born. </p>
<p>Comb720 currently runs off an open-source platform called WaRP board. WaRP board puts Comb720 on the level of big corporations because it has all the high-end parts of any normal smart watch. In the future, I hope to have a main board designed just for Comb720. The tessellation of hexagons allows the watch to display all the information needed in a very organized and space efficient manner. On typical smart watches, things move around and the user gets lost. However with Comb720 the OS only allows the user to get one page away from home making it so you can't get lost. While the OS for the Comb720 is very nice looking, it also has amazing reason behind it! </p>
<p>Comb720 will ship in two models: Comb720 Active and Comb720 Leather. Comb720 Leather is displayed above, it has a genuine leather strap and a metallic case. Comb720 Leather is just as nice as any fancy watch, except you get the added bonus of the revolutionary tessellation of hexagons! Comb720 Active has an athletic paracord watch band with an adjustable strap. It also has a gorgeous carbon fiber reinforced body, this makes Comb720 Active incredibly durable! I hope to make both models of Comb720 waterproof. At the moment I am talking about a waterproofing nano coating with a few different companies. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I need $50,000 so that I can finalize the design for Comb720 and ready it for production. I will use this money to make a prototype, make the companion app, and finalize other payments. I have an amazing software engineer working for a very low price and I would love to have him work on the companion app too. If I raise enough funds, I will also hire someone to design a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) so that I don't have to use WaRP board. Lastly, I will use this money to ramp up production on Comb720 so I have capacity to produce them as needed. Please give me a hand and donate today!</div>
<div>My favorite perk to donating is the first prototype ever made! This watch will be my most valued possession and would be a nice addition to anyone's trophy room. Another awesome perk is designing your own watch face. Imagine how cool that would be to send me your drawings and have them turned into a watch face that any user can pick from. This watch face would be in the hands of consumers everywhere! The VIP Access perk is also pretty awesome. You will be able to redeem a coupon code to order a Comb720 before the general public. This means you will have the coolest new gadget that you can showoff to all your friends and family! The early bird Comb720 is sweet in my opinion because you are going to receive a wonderful smart watch before the general public can even buy it! How crazy is that?</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your donation of any size would impact me forever! This is my dream, I have given all my money to the company and liquidated lots of my favorite things. I truly and honestly believe that with your support we can make Comb720 a smashing success. Comb720 will bring on a new era of simplicity for the smart watch industry. With my revolutionary seven tessellation design we will be able to change the smart watch industry forever. We can show the big corporations that simple is the new smart! </p>
<p>This project is valuable to you not only because of the perks, but because you know that you have changed my life forever. I will never forget the generosity you could show by just donating a simple five dollars. Please, if you feel able give me a hand, and let's change what consumers knows about simple!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This project will have many challenges along the way, tons that I cannot even predict. One potential challenge is getting in touch with big manufacturers. They may not be open to business with a 7th grader. I think that if I get big enough where I can develop my own PCB (Printed Circuit Board) the manufactures will talk to a representative. Another challenge might be developing my own PCB for Comb720. However, I believe that if we hire a professional to develop the PCB there won't be any issues. There will also be plenty of other challenges along the way, but I believe that with your help we can bring Comb720 to market!</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>There are thousands of ways you can help if you can't pledge money! I always need more support so please spread the word to a friend or co-worker. Also be sure to share Comb720 on social media. Lastly, if you are an electrical engineer, software developer, or anybody who wants to give me some advice, I would LOVE to contact you!</p>

<p>Hello! I'm Kylie, the creator of fashaholics.com. I'm equal parts computer-nerd and fashion lover, with a penchant for handmade and vintage pieces. I've always had an entrepreneurial drive and preferred taking the self-taught path. Consequently, I am drawn to the passionate do-it-yourself'ers: the artists, independents, and local business owners.</p>
<p>Fashion has been a part of my life significantly for the last ten years. I've opened and managed a modern/vintage buy-sell-trade store, an e-commerce store, and maintained a hobby of scouring thrift stores and flea markets for special home and wardrobe pieces.</p>
<p>In that time, I have also discovered my talents in web and graphic design. I create logos, print materials, websites and blogs for small businesses in my free time. I also monitor or advise them in social media marketing.</p>
<p>All of this has led me to where I am today. An intensely motivated lady with an idea that perfectly aligns my skills with my passions, creating a website that will not only intrigue and inspire other fashaholics, but also help build awareness and support for independent artists and small businesses.</p>
<p>fashaholics.com is your ultimate online fashion destination with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A comprehensive shopping guide - mapping out all the local and independently-owned shops and boutiques in hundreds of major cities nationwide (with plans to expand worldwide).</li>
<li>An online boutique - featuring a highly-edited selection of handmade, vintage, and one-of-a-kind clothing, shoes, and accessories. You will find a variety of ever-changing merchandise from a diverse group of artists and designers.</li>
<li>A daily blog and seasonal e-zine - delivered from a creative group of writers, photographers, stylists, illustrators, and more.</li>
</ul><p>At this point, I've logged many hours planning, organizing and creating. I am within arms reach of sharing my dream with the world, but I need your help. I am looking for $5,000 in funding to assist with the startup process. In return, I'm giving out gift certificates and fashaholics goodies. Any help is immensely appreciated.</p>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I like to do things that are a win-win. You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours.</p>
<ul>
<li>I need $5,000 to help with startup costs (advertising, supplies, and promotional materials). It is vital that I get the word out and develop a strong web presence.</li>
<li>If you donate, you're awesome. I'll show my gratitude in the form of goodies (stickers and such) and gift cards for the online shop!</li>
<li>If I do not reach the goal of $5,000, I will still use the funds raised towards the startup...because every penny counts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone benefits, really. You get to enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new shop that is full of quality products, making it easier for you to find that special piece.</li>
<li>An organized way to discover special, locally-owned spots for your next road trip or vacation.</li>
<li>A wealth of information and inspiration from the blog and e-zine.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the local shopkeepers and independent artists meet new customers and increase sales. The writers, photographers, and blog contributers gain publicity and awareness. Advertising is expensive, and this is a great opportunity for these hardworking companies and individuals to reach their target market.</p>

<p><strong>***UPDATE FRI 09 NOV***</strong></p>
<p><strong>We did it! We hit our initial goal of $7500! We're so grateful and excited that so many people are on board and believe in the brand. </strong></p>
<p><strong>That so many of you, from so many cities and countries around the world,  have so enthusiastically embraced us and sent us you love and hard earned cash is a testament to how underserved we are when it comes to alternative masculine styled clothing options. Every comment you wrote on here, on our facebook, twitter and in emails inspires us all over again that this is something important our community really needs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Its not over yet. We need to make it to $16,000 to launch a full scale production run in our factory and produce more stock than what has been pre-ordered so that the online store can begin to run. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Please, keep shopping the pre-sale and keep sharing! Together we are making this happen!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sending all my love and thanks to everyone that has been a part of this!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is Kreuzbach10?</strong></p>
<p>Kreuzbach 10 makes men's shirts, cut to fit women's bodies.</p>
<p>We don't like to say we make women's shirts, because that makes us sound like a lot of other labels who take a button up shirt, feminize it with girly colours  and patterns and maybe even add some frilly bits then still have the nerve to call it 'man style.'</p>
<p>That's not us.</p>
<p>Our shirts are designed to be straight up what you'd expect to find in the men's department; Primary colours, geometric patterns, no frills.<br/>However unlike shirts in the men's department Kreuzbach10 shirts are cut to fit female bodies. We know that women's shoulders, chests, waists and hips are in different ratios to men, but furthermore in different ratios to each other. That’s why we have developed our core 3 cuts that cater to different body shapes and we hope to expand to more cuts the brand grows. We're clear about which shirt is which cut, so if you buy one that fits you like a glove, its easy to find more that will make you look just as hot.</p>
<p>We've stood in the men's change room in briefs and a tux shirt cursing because anything that does up comfortably on our hips looks like a potato sack on the rest of our body.<br/>We've stood in the women's change room wondering if any brand will make something actually designed to fit comfortably cover a bust rather than be splayed open.</p>
<p>We know that it can feel like the entire world of 'fashion' is going out of their way to make you feel out of place if you’re not a girly girl but we want you to know that we think you’re awesome just the way you are.</p>
<p>So awesome that we’re making clothes just for you.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>The Mini Milestone: What K10 Can Achieve With $7500</strong></p>
<p>With $7500 K10 will be back in the black. We've borrowed funds to begin getting samples made. We realized early on that you, our potential customers, need to see what the shirts actually going to be like before you want to pre-order or support our business. It was a bit of a 'the chicken or the egg' scenario, we had the genesis of the business, but no funds to make samples, and without samples to show people not much chance of getting financed, so we went out on a limb and borrowed money to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>The process of getting professional factory standard prototypes developed, and having them tweaked into samples that are pretty much ready to roll with an order have cost us almost $3000. We've had a bunch of smaller costs associated with getting the business set up to function, things like domain registration, online store software, hosting, and then some costs associated with marketing and promotion (eco-print business cards and flyers, paying the sexy model and talented creatives that helped with the photoshoot) that have crept up to just over $1000.</p>
<p>If we raise the $7500, we will 100% still deliver on any rewards that people have been promised. Hats, posters and stickers will all come out as planned. For the actual shirts it means doing a limited edition run of shirts in one or two styles so that everyone who claimed a shirt as a reward will still get one. As we won't have made minimum numbers for the factory we've been working with, these will be produced in Australia at a much higher cost per unit. Depending on the ratio of shirt rewards to other rewards claimed, we anticipate that will take up the remaining $3.5K of the funds raised.</p>
<p>If we hit the $7500 we'll consider our crowdfunding campaign run a success. We'll have gone from a little idea to a registered business, with a network of supporters and contacts. But more than that, we'll have patterns and prototypes ready to go, and we'll have proven that we have an audience. This puts us in a great position to apply to financial institutions and/or Angel Investors for the capital to launch our first full scale production run in early 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Tipping Point: What K10 Can Achieve With $16000 </strong></p>
<p>If we raise $16K we'll have the capital to cover all of the earlier expenses aaaaand do our first production run! Hurrah! You can buy awesome Kreuzbach10 shirts that make you look sexy, in a slick online store, as early as December! Our first collection will go into production in November and any pre-ordered shirts will be shipped in early/mid December (in time for the Judeo-Christian Holiday season, if you're that way inclined!) We'll be able to provide everyone who has selected 'shirt' as a reward with a choice of 3-4 designs (minimum!) and we'll also be able to produce more shirts than have been ordered,so the online store can go live with more shirts for you and your friends and family to buy. The sales from this stock will then provide the capital for producing more shirts, and then from those more again. We'll be able to fund successive collections from the one prior and so be able to grow without running more fundraising campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Goal: What K10 Can Achieve with $32000 </strong></p>
<p>With $32 000 we can double our production run! What does this mean? It means more shirts to choose from. We will be able to meet minimum production numbers on more styles, so right from the start we can launch a minimum of 3-4 different designs in the Smart Casual Collection and a minimum 3-4 designs in the Special Occasions Collection. Pending negotiations with our factory, what we'd be pushing for is 6 styles in each collection. It means if you've claimed a shirt as a reward you'll have a lot more to choose from, and a lot more to buy later too. It means much larger scale of operation, which means more momentum for continued growth and a rapid increase in the amount and styles of shirts available so right from December this year into the start of 2013 you have more chance of finding shirts in our collection that match exactly what you've been dreaming of.</p>
<p>More excitingly, when we hit $32000 we'll have the funds to develop patterns for plus size styles. One of our biggest disappointments so far is that we haven't been able to afford do this right from the start. Our current patterns are scaled for an Australian 6-16 (US 2-12, UK 4-14, Germany 30-40 France 32-42) but we're keen to accommodate ladies who wear bigger sizes. This will mean that pattern development for these can start immediately, and we'll produce the same styles in larger sizes as early as the second production run. This is really important to the ethos of Kreuzbach10. We don't want anyone to be left out.</p>
<p><strong>What if Dreams Come True?: If we raise $33000 or more! </strong></p>
<p>If we raise more than 33k Kreuzbach10 may be coming to a city near you! With our global business model, we're committed long term to an online model of operation to keep costs low and keep the shirts as cheap as possible, and also to make the brand accessible to everyone that wants it, no matter where they are in the world. For these reasons we're not looking to rent a permanent retail space anywhere, but we're keen to tour a few pop up shops around the world to reach out to people that may be a bit unsure about online shopping.</p>
<p>What is a pop up shop? An exciting temporary retail space. We're already exploring the possibility of touring a few European Capital cities in the second half of 2013 and setting up exciting mini shops for people to visit and try things on and chat about the brand. (As well as exciting specials, giveaways and maybe some entertainment!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Let your friends know about our brand. Our stretch goals seem a bit big and scary at the moment but to reach $16000 we really only need 160 people to claim a shirt as a reward. Thats 5 people per day from anywhere in the world for the duration of the campaign. </p>

<h3 align=""center""><strong>What is a Quaffer?</strong></h3>
<p align=""center""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.quaffer.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/three%20drinks%20copy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 341px; height: 153px;""/></strong></p>
<p>The Quaffer is a patented Double Bubble Shot Glass with a built-in chaser that allows two liquids to stay separated.  The Glass Quaffer measures 2.25oz on the bottom and 1oz on top. You put any chaser in the bottom and any liquor on top. The liquids will stay separated until consumed.                        </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>Why it works?</strong></h3>
<p align=""center""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.quaffer.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/pour1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 339px; height: 136px;""/></strong></p>
<p>The Quaffer works because liquor is less dense then most sugar based chasers, so the liquids want to stay separated.  The design and shape of the glass keeps them separated.  You pour the chaser to the neck of the glass, then when pouring the liquor, as long as you don’t pour directly in the hole, the liquor will stay separated until consumed.</p>

<p align=""center"">Tilt your head back, let the liquids flow and enjoy!  The Quaffer is guaranteed to be the best shot you've ever had!</p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>The History…</strong></h3>
<p>I designed and patented the Quaffer over 10 years ago while I was attending Arizona State University.  Originally I had the Glass Quaffers made in Italy, but four years later I wanted to bring the production of the Glass to the U.S.A.  I found a manufacturer to produce the Glass Quaffer and have had them made in America ever since.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.quaffer.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/qdrawing2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.quaffer.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/usa1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>The Problem…</strong></h3>
<p>Although the Quaffer has been around for over 10 years we had a setback a year and a half ago when our glass company suddenly stopped manufacturing the Glass.  For the last year and a half we have searched for a new manufacturer, but with no success.  There have been offers from overseas companies, but we wanted to keep the quality and durability of the glass as high as possible by having them produced here in the U.S.A.! </p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.quaffer.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/qdrawing2.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 384px; height: 250px;""/> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>The Solution…</strong></h3>
<p align=""center""> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.quaffer.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/hole1%20copy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After much discussion and putting our heads together we have come up with a solution that will allow us to get the GLASS Quaffers produced here in the U.S.A. again.  We opened the middle hole that keeps the liquids separated from .85” to 1” and guess what...it worked!  It worked so well, the GLASS now pours easier and drinks better! </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>With Your Help…</strong></h3>
<p align=""center""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.quaffer.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/glass.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer is ready to produce the glass again!  Unfortunately, with a year and a half of no glass sales we do not have the funds for the production run.  So, we are turning to you for help.   With your support we can Bring the Glass Back!    </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>The Thanks…</strong></h3>

What is a Quaffer?

The Quaffer is a patented Double Bubble Shot Glass with a built-in chaser that allows two liquids to stay separated.  The Glass Quaffer measures 2.25oz on the bottom and 1oz on top. You put any chaser in the bottom and any liquor on top. The liquids will stay separated until consumed.                        
Why it works?

The Quaffer works because liquor is less dense then most sugar based chasers, so the liquids want to stay separated.  The design and shape of the glass keeps them separated.  You pour the chaser to the neck of the glass, then when pouring the liquor, as long as you don’t pour directly in the hole, the liquor will stay separated until consumed.
 To drink…

 
Tilt your head back, let the liquids flow and enjoy!  The Quaffer is guaranteed to be the best shot you've ever had!
The History…
I designed and patented the Quaffer over 10 years ago while I was attending Arizona State University.  Originally I had the Glass Quaffers made in Italy, but four years later I wanted to bring the production of the Glass to the U.S.A.  I found a manufacturer to produce the Glass Quaffer and have had them made in America ever since.
 
The Problem…
Although the Quaffer has been around for over 10 years we had a setback a year and a half ago when our glass company suddenly stopped manufacturing the Glass.  For the last year and a half we have searched for a new manufacturer, but with no success.  There have been offers from overseas companies, but we wanted to keep the quality and durability of the glass as high as possible by having them produced here in the U.S.A.! 
 
The Solution…
 
After much discussion and putting our heads together we have come up with a solution that will allow us to get the GLASS Quaffers produced here in the U.S.A. again.  We opened the middle hole that keeps the liquids separated from .85” to 1” and guess what...it worked!  It worked so well, the GLASS now pours easier and drinks better! 
With Your Help…

The manufacturer is ready to produce the glass again!  Unfortunately, with a year and a half of no glass sales we do not have the funds for the production run.  So, we are turning to you for help.   With your support we can Bring the Glass Back!    
The Thanks…
Thanks to Indiegogo and because of you, as soon as we are funded we can get the production run lined up!  This means the glass production day could be as soon as the day the campaign ends!  So, you should see your new and improved Quaffer Glasses by the first or second week in October!

<h3>About ariafritta</h3>
<p>Ariafritta is a project of Lisa and Francesca, former classmates and friends, now also business partners. Ariafritta has arisen from a feeling for creating: thinking, designing and making. We create handbags and accessories that we would like to wear every day.</p>
<p>We started our project in June 2012, designing and making our first collection which was launched in September. We got a great success among friends and friends of friends. Two months later we were already participating to an exhibition in Venice. Since then, our idea grown and now we would like to make Ariafritta more real. We want to open a studio where creating, making and promoting our work…a place where people can stop by to see, talk and collaborate.</p>

<p>We are only asking what we need right now and every little bit will be useful for us.</p>
<p>The funds will be use as follow:</p>

<p>My name is April Howard and I am a fashion designer working on my Fall/Winter 2014 collection. It is my dream to launch my new line in New York and be able to work on it full-time.</p>
<p>I just finished this amazing business program in Oakland called Women's Initiative, which helped me write my business plan and get my business side in line with my creative side. I am excited to put my plan into action and move back to New York to launch my line.</p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>I have over 10 years of experience working in the apparel and home furnishings industries. In 2003, I graduated from The Fashion Institute of Technology with a degree in textile design. After FIT, I worked at Ralph Lauren in their textile and home department.</p>
<p>In 2006, I moved to San Francisco to pursue a degree at the Academy of Art. While in school, I fell in love with draping on the dress form and knew I never wanted to do anything else.  During the summer of 2009, I worked with Rodarte in Los Angeles, and stayed on to work with the company during four seasons of Fashion Week in New York.</p>
<p>In 2010, I graduated from the Academy of Art and began selling my line at Harputs and The Factory in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have never been able to fully focus on my line because I am always working a full-time day job. This campaign will help me focus my efforts and launch my line whole-heartedly!!</p>

Both landmarks became symbols of firsts.Our inspiration was New York in the ‘30s, the time that set the foundations of what New York stands for today: hard-working immigrants, liberty, fine journalism, the creative industry, self-made men, skyscrapers, and the sexual revolution – just to name a few. And lets not forget to mention New York's music heritage too, from Fats Waller to George Gershwin.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;If you think about it, New York doesn't have a watch. Sure, there are many famous brands in New York that make watches, but these timepieces are a reflection of these brands and not a symbol of NYC itself. We did not want to use clichéd solutions, and definitely wanted to have a black and white design.Every component of the Grand New Yorker is custom-made, from its thick stainless steel case to the very last detail on the dial. We selected only the finest materials and paid attention to first-class details.The Grand New Yorker watch collection is brought to life with the help of our excellent suppliers and highly reputable factories that manufacture goods for global luxury brands in the watch industry.Watch case: Stainless steelWater resistant: 3 ATM, 30 metersGlass: Domed glass with anti-scratch surface finishStrap size: 20 mm, best fit for 14 - 22 cm wristWatch size (diameter / thickness): 40 mm / 9 mmMovement: Japanese quartz movementStrap: Soft nappa leatherBuckle: Stainless steel pin buckleWarranty: 2 year limited warranty against manufacturing defectsThe Grand New Yorker features a unique, battery-operated quartz movement made in Japan, featuring a sweeping secondhand.Unlike conventional quartz movements, where the secondhand hits just once per second, our innovative movement hits four times. Today, the Grand New Yorker is one of the rare watches that feature this innovative technology, which gives the timepiece the feel of a luxury automatic Swiss watch without an expensive price tag and the hassle of winding the watch every day. The fluid movement is a reflection of Frank Sinatra's city that never sleeps.Pictures of the watches are real photos taken from prototypes(not digital renders).Classic Grand New Yorker / WhiteRoman Grand New Yorker / WhiteClassic Grand New Yorker / BlackRoman Grand New Yorker / BlackThe Grand New Yorker comes with a super-soft, nappa leather strap that can easily be changed by its clever spring bar without special tools.Have a Question?If you would like to reach us, please email us at info-at-aronnewyork-dot-com
 Aron is a startup democratic luxury brand. We founded Aron with one wish – to empower like-minded people to create beyond.New York City is the centerpiece of our universe. Nothing compares to her and you won't find a better match for genius. At Aron, we turn everyday objects into relevant statements through an original design language that is inspired by New York City’s cosmopolitan mindset, and its timeless elegance.Behind our brand stands a founder with a refined taste for craft and an experienced eye for quality. Aron's designs are elegant and intelligent, yet have a recognizable voice that appeals to all genders.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;One Last Thing - We've Got a Little More to Tell YouThe hands of the Grand New Yorker form a half compass and a half square, the basic tools of creating buildings and the main tools of the masonic craft. According to masonic symbolism, the square is an emblem of virtue in which we must ""square our actions by the square of virtue with all mankind.” The compasses exemplify the wisdom of our conduct and the strength to ""circumscribe our desires and keep our passions within due bounds.” When these two tools are placed together, peace and harmony is the result.The creator of this project would like to gratefully thank the outstanding support from Mr. Burn Gorman. Special thanks to my firends, who not only believed in this project but worked so hard to make it happen.",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

In our everyday life we are
surrounded with mass produced, molded plastic products – all identical and often cheap. A stereotype of plastic as a low value, individuality lacking material is strong.   we are disrupting this perceptionWith years of engineering and designing on the edge of art and technology, we discovered a completely new processes - plastic is shaped in the hands of the artist literally in the air. As a result a familiar material takes new staggering forms, deep and rich textures of jewelry with truly luxurious and smart touch. The possibilities, processes and final result are fascinating.
        PLASTIC IS FORMED BY HANDS LITERALLY 
                                       IN THE AIRWe have to be fast and precise from the first take. Each piece is different from the other by the nature of their production. They may be the same style, but every item is unique.

get a better print quality: shirts have to be printed as all-over print (sublimation), so that the pomegrenate is huge and covers the front of the body (more expensive), this way the T-Shirt works more like a fashion item than a political T-Shirt: people will like to wear it because it looks nice
set-up and maintain the webshop 
Still a lot of people have never heard about  the genocide of the armeniansHelp to raise people's awareness of the genocide that was committed in 1915. Only if people learn about a genocide, they can discuss it.  
1.6 mio. armenians were killed, help to remember them

<strong>PoopPac Dog Walkers Case; </strong><strong>The Perfect Solution to a Messy Problem! </strong>

<h3><em><strong>The Challenge: </strong></em></h3>
<p><span>Picking up your dogs fresh 'dinners past' upon deposit and getting rid of it ASAP</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p>...a case to carry dog waste, discretely, with style, odor free and hands free when you are walking your dog, especially in areas that do not have frequent convenient trash cans i.e.  neighborhoods, the beach, boating, hiking, camping and so forth… I wanted to enjoy my walk, hands free, and not limit my treks to planning around waste stations and trash cans.</p>
<h3>
<em><strong>The Solution</strong></em>:</h3>
<p><img alt=""PoopPac Dog Walkers Case"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/522861/pictures/full/20121104204440-Case_with_open_insert3.jpg?1352090717"" src="""" style="""" title=""PoopPac Dog Walkers Case""/></p>
<h3><span>PoopPac Dog Walkers Case: </span></h3>
<p><span>My main objective in designing my case was to design a product that was durable and light weight but most importantly a case that had a rigid frame so that you could pop your package in it and be worry free of smell, accidents and of the ‘package’ touching other items…  With PoopPac you can now pop the case in your car, stroller, attach it to your backpack, belt, leash etc. and relax until you cross a convenient trash can or until you return home.  With PoopPac you are hands free to enjoy your walk!</span></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.pooppac.com/pooppac-spec/whatispooppac/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PoopPac Features and Specs</a> (links to more detailed info on the PoopPac)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The PoopPac Story:</h3>
<p>Schlepping smelly waste bags, with coffee in the other hand, managing a stroller, children, more than one dog... it's a challenge! Raining, gloves, carrying waste; yuk and so inconvenient. There must be a better way? And now there is; PoopPac Dog Walkers Case.</p>
<p>Field market research proved the PoopPac concept to be a great hit and the PoopPac received fabulous feedback, testimonials and media reviews. In fact in Sept 2012 PoopPac was invited to participate in the Emmy's gifting lounge! However at the same time as having all of this super product acceptance, sadly my local manufacturer, having been in business for 20 years, closed down just as I was bringing the PoopPac's to market. Hmmm; quite the challenge as manufacturing locally allowed me to place small and frequent orders, meant no shipping and storage costs, and offered very short leadtimes, thus allowing me to go into production as a small self-funded start-up.</p>
<p>Losing local manufacturing means increased costs for shipping and storage and thus the need to place much larger orders in order to achieve a viable retail price point for the PoopPac. The new manufacturer is in place, samples approved, and in order to meet the manufacturing price point a large first order needs to be placed. The funds from this campaign will be used solely to fund the first production run of PoopPac's.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<div>
<h3><em>My Need...</em></h3>
<p>I am a self-funded start-up venture. All of the fundementals arein place; design patent approved, utility patent pending. Trademarks are in place, website and on-line store are up, as is the PoopPac facebook page. Stores have contacted me wishing to carry PoopPac's, as soon as I can meet the required wholesale pricing. I have a qualified new manufacturer, and with this new manufacturer in place I can meet the target wholesale pricing and make PoopPac a viable business. Now all that is needed is inventory!!! </p>
<p>I need to raise an additional $20,000 in order to place my first order for production quality tooling and for inventory to meet the factories minimum order requirement. Being a small startup, traditional funding isunavailable and I have exhausted my own resources getting my project this far. Accordingly I am here on Ideiegogo seeking your help. With your pledges to support this venture and pre-orders for PoopPac's we can move forward and provide a great tool to assist dog owners manage 'dinners past' with ease, style and convenience and reduce the negitive environmental impact of littered waste.</p>
<h3><em>Perks for Supporting My Project...</em></h3>
<p>I have a small number of PoopPac's in stock to kick off this campaign. Thus to accommodatte early birds who would love a PoopPac, as a perk for supporting this project, in time for Christmas, I have set up this project as Flexible Funding so that I can ship Perks to the early birds immediately; so pledge away please!</p>
<p>Those of you that are not in a rush, your PoopPac thank you Perk is planned to be coming off the new production line and will be shipping no later than March 2013.</p>
<p><strong><em>ALL PoopPac Dog Walkers Cases shipped as PERKS will include</em></strong>: Removable Wrist Strap, Removable adjustable Shoulder Strap, Built in Belt Clip, Installed 1 x Roll of Waste Bags, 1 x Installed Activate Charcoal Sachet.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>PoopPacs and Similar Products Really Do Make a Positive Impact on Our Environment...</h3>

</div></div>","PoopPac Dog Walkers Case; The Perfect Solution to a Messy Problem! 

The Challenge: 
Picking up your dogs fresh 'dinners past' upon deposit and getting rid of it ASAP
 

 
The Need...

 
...a case to carry dog waste, discretely, with style, odor free and hands free when you are walking your dog, especially in areas that do not have frequent convenient trash cans i.e.  neighborhoods, the beach, boating, hiking, camping and so forth… I wanted to enjoy my walk, hands free, and not limit my treks to planning around waste stations and trash cans.

The Solution:

PoopPac Dog Walkers Case: 
My main objective in designing my case was to design a product that was durable and light weight but most importantly a case that had a rigid frame so that you could pop your package in it and be worry free of smell, accidents and of the ‘package’ touching other items…  With PoopPac you can now pop the case in your car, stroller, attach it to your backpack, belt, leash etc. and relax until you cross a convenient trash can or until you return home.  With PoopPac you are hands free to enjoy your walk!

The PoopPac Story:
Schlepping smelly waste bags, with coffee in the other hand, managing a stroller, children, more than one dog... it's a challenge! Raining, gloves, carrying waste; yuk and so inconvenient. There must be a better way? And now there is; PoopPac Dog Walkers Case.
Field market research proved the PoopPac concept to be a great hit and the PoopPac received fabulous feedback, testimonials and media reviews. In fact in Sept 2012 PoopPac was invited to participate in the Emmy's gifting lounge! However at the same time as having all of this super product acceptance, sadly my local manufacturer, having been in business for 20 years, closed down just as I was bringing the PoopPac's to market. Hmmm; quite the challenge as manufacturing locally allowed me to place small and frequent orders, meant no shipping and storage costs, and offered very short leadtimes, thus allowing me to go into production as a small self-funded start-up.
Losing local manufacturing means increased costs for shipping and storage and thus the need to place much larger orders in order to achieve a viable retail price point for the PoopPac. The new manufacturer is in place, samples approved, and in order to meet the manufacturing price point a large first order needs to be placed. The funds from this campaign will be used solely to fund the first production run of PoopPac's.
 
What I Need & What You Get...

My Need...
I am a self-funded start-up venture. All of the fundementals arein place; design patent approved, utility patent pending. Trademarks are in place, website and on-line store are up, as is the PoopPac facebook page. Stores have contacted me wishing to carry PoopPac's, as soon as I can meet the required wholesale pricing. I have a qualified new manufacturer, and with this new manufacturer in place I can meet the target wholesale pricing and make PoopPac a viable business. Now all that is needed is inventory!!! 
I need to raise an additional $20,000 in order to place my first order for production quality tooling and for inventory to meet the factories minimum order requirement. Being a small startup, traditional funding isunavailable and I have exhausted my own resources getting my project this far. Accordingly I am here on Ideiegogo seeking your help. With your pledges to support this venture and pre-orders for PoopPac's we can move forward and provide a great tool to assist dog owners manage 'dinners past' with ease, style and convenience and reduce the negitive environmental impact of littered waste.
Perks for Supporting My Project...
I have a small number of PoopPac's in stock to kick off this campaign. Thus to accommodatte early birds who would love a PoopPac, as a perk for supporting this project, in time for Christmas, I have set up this project as Flexible Funding so that I can ship Perks to the early birds immediately; so pledge away please!
Those of you that are not in a rush, your PoopPac thank you Perk is planned to be coming off the new production line and will be shipping no later than March 2013.
ALL PoopPac Dog Walkers Cases shipped as PERKS will include: Removable Wrist Strap, Removable adjustable Shoulder Strap, Built in Belt Clip, Installed 1 x Roll of Waste Bags, 1 x Installed Activate Charcoal Sachet.

</p><p>""For close to 40 years I have been in the business of designing, producing
and marketing leather accessories for luxury markets around the world. </p>
<p>Lulea gives me the opportunity to apply this life-long experience
into a meaningful business model in an environment that is now thankfully ready
for sustainable growth and development.</p>
<p>The idea for Lulea started in 2011 when I was invited to Kenya to
design a range of products and to help set-up a production facility. While
assessing the existing local production in the region, I found that in most
cases the working conditions were, at best inadequate with tools and the
equipment sometimes non-existent. But what was most striking of all was that
there was practically no investment in training at all. </p>
<p>Today I can say that Lulea has possibly the best-equipped leather
goods production facilitiesin East Africa. </p>
<p>The decision to call our facility a “Centre of Excellence” was made
to project excellence as a reference that illustrates our intention and
commitment at creating superior quality in products and services for our esteemed
customers. The “aim for excellence” is what I coach to our Lulea employees as I
believe it challenges everyone involved (including myself) to meet the best
possible standards and hopefully this is visible in the products we hand craft.</p>
<p>I have used the elephant in the Lulea logo as symbol of what I am
striving to achieve. The elephant is not a predator or a scavenger they are also
very social animals that pass knowledge through the accumulated experience of the
matriarchs. </p>
<p>To me it is the perfect symbol for a triple-bottom-line business
model that can be simply expressed by saying, “Do well, do good and feel good
about it.”</p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b></b></b></p><p></p><p><b><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/631803/files/20140607063815-7.jpg?1402148295"" src="""" style=""""/></b></b></p><b><b></b></b><p></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b>The Lulea Impact</b></b></p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""></b><p>At Lulea we believe that by creating sustained and regulated employment for communities surrounding our facilities we can help to break deeply engrained cycles of poverty. </p><p>Our partnership with the Baraka Womens Centre in Nairobi means that we can offer some of the most vulnerable members of the community the opportunity to gain independence and a usable skill that they can pass on to the wider region.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/631805/files/20140607063942-21.jpg?1402148382"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center; font-weight: bold;""><b><b>Your Impact </b></b></p><p>By purchasing a Lulea handbag you are actively helping to create a new way of looking at the production of luxury fashion in developing regions. </p><p>By wearing your Lulea handbag and speaking to your friends about what we are achieving you are becoming an ambassador for change and development. </p><p>If we reach our Indiegogo target we will be able to create new employment and grow the Lulea workshop in Thika, Kenya as well as our workforce throughout Africa and Europe. </p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/690160/files/20140702124448-1.jpg?1404330288"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Perks</b></p><p>By supporting Lulea through Indiegogo you are not only helping to grow

Each member of the production team is taught personally by Mr Chesneau.</p><p><b>What is Lulea hoping to achieve?</b></p><p>As more and more of the worlds accessories are produced at a low price but with a high human cost, we aim to create a new business model that redresses imbalances in modern fashion production while offering fair wages and excellent working conditions to all Lulea team members. We hope that by offering the transfer of skills and employment to some of the most vulnerable members of the local community that we can be an agent for change and positively affect wider regional growth.<br/></p><p></p>

THANK YOU!    What is Lulea?From  day one we have worked under our Do Good, Feel Good ethos. We believe that we can create a benchmark in the production standards of luxury leather goods under the ""Made in Kenya"" label.Founded by award-winning, internationally-acclaimed premium leather and accessories designer, Edmond Chesneau, Lulea is an enterprise for social impact which specialises in training Kenyan workers to master the craft of leather-work in order to create sustainable luxury leather goods of outstanding quality for the global market.Who are we? Our workshop is based in Thika, Kenya. All handbags are made on location under the watchful gaze of our founder and master craftsman, Edmond Chesneau. The rest of the team are spread over Kenya, Ireland and the UK. We are small but with your help we are hoping to grow both on-the-ground and globally. Who is Edmond Chesneau?Edmond Chesneau began his career in Ireland as a designer under the tuition of a former master craftsman from internationally-renowned luxury leather goods house, Hermes. Mr. Chesneau’s 35 years’ experience coaching workforces in Ireland and Asia has helped him conceive a teaching model in the techniques and traditions of leather craftsmanship that he continues to pass to the Lulea trainee staff.
""For close to 40 years I have been in the business of designing, producing
and marketing leather accessories for luxury markets around the world. 
Lulea gives me the opportunity to apply this life-long experience
into a meaningful business model in an environment that is now thankfully ready
for sustainable growth and development.
The idea for Lulea started in 2011 when I was invited to Kenya to
design a range of products and to help set-up a production facility. While
assessing the existing local production in the region, I found that in most
cases the working conditions were, at best inadequate with tools and the
equipment sometimes non-existent. But what was most striking of all was that
there was practically no investment in training at all. 
Today I can say that Lulea has possibly the best-equipped leather
goods production facilitiesin East Africa. 
The decision to call our facility a “Centre of Excellence” was made
to project excellence as a reference that illustrates our intention and
commitment at creating superior quality in products and services for our esteemed
customers. The “aim for excellence” is what I coach to our Lulea employees as I
believe it challenges everyone involved (including myself) to meet the best
possible standards and hopefully this is visible in the products we hand craft.
I have used the elephant in the Lulea logo as symbol of what I am
striving to achieve. The elephant is not a predator or a scavenger they are also
very social animals that pass knowledge through the accumulated experience of the
matriarchs. 
To me it is the perfect symbol for a triple-bottom-line business
model that can be simply expressed by saying, “Do well, do good and feel good
about it.”The Lulea ImpactAt Lulea we believe that by creating sustained and regulated employment for communities surrounding our facilities we can help to break deeply engrained cycles of poverty. Our partnership with the Baraka Womens Centre in Nairobi means that we can offer some of the most vulnerable members of the community the opportunity to gain independence and a usable skill that they can pass on to the wider region.Your Impact By purchasing a Lulea handbag you are actively helping to create a new way of looking at the production of luxury fashion in developing regions. By wearing your Lulea handbag and speaking to your friends about what we are achieving you are becoming an ambassador for change and development. If we reach our Indiegogo target we will be able to create new employment and grow the Lulea workshop in Thika, Kenya as well as our workforce throughout Africa and Europe. The PerksBy supporting Lulea through Indiegogo you are not only helping to grow
our business you are also getting the opportunity to own one or more of our
beautifully made luxury handbags.  We know situations differ so we have
tried to create opportunities for everyone to support Lulea through our
Indiegogo perks.  At Lulea we never expect to get something for nothing so
each of our perks allow you to own a Lulea product, however big or small. LIMITED EDITION INAUGURAL COLLECTIONS Introducing the Lulea Karen Collection and the Lulea Kenyan Collections. To commemorate the first production run of our inaugural lines the first 50 bags of each style ordered through Indiegogo will feature a commemorative leather patch that marks this bag as one of the first ever made in our Centre of Excellence in  Kenya. We are hoping these bags will become the collectors items of the future.FAQ’sWhen will I receive my order?We hope to delivery all products pre-ordered through Indiegogo by Sept / Oct 2014.   What if I have a question that is not on the FAQ's?Please send any questions you have to info@luxuryleatherafrica.comHow was Lulea founded?Lulea was founded in 2011 by premium leather accessories designer Edmond Chesneau.  A trip to Kenya to teach a masterclass in leather craft techniques inspired Edmonds well honed entrepreneurial spirit. He decided to create a sustainable leather production house based in Kenya that would produce luxury goods for the global market.What are the Lulea objectives?To break the cycle of negative perception around ""Made in Africa"" labels by the production of sustainable luxury goods of a very high quality.  This will be achieved by growing the Lulea training and production Centre of Excellence and in doing so, transform lives in disadvantaged communities through training and employment.Where is the Lulea Centre of Excellence based?All Lulea bags are made in the Lulea workshop in Thika, Kenya. Thika is an industrial town located approximately 40 kms (25 mls) north east of Nairobi.Where do you source Lulea raw materials?Whenever at all possible all materials for the Lulea bags are sourced locally in Kenya. Who are the people making the Lulea bags?The Lulea team are spread far and wide over both Kenya and Europe but those based in the workshop in Thika are made up of locally sourced skilled workers and Lulea trainees which we source from our partnership the WCI Baraka Womens Centre in Nairobi. Each member of the production team is taught personally by Mr Chesneau.What is Lulea hoping to achieve?As more and more of the worlds accessories are produced at a low price but with a high human cost, we aim to create a new business model that redresses imbalances in modern fashion production while offering fair wages and excellent working conditions to all Lulea team members. We hope that by offering the transfer of skills and employment to some of the most vulnerable members of the local community that we can be an agent for change and positively affect wider regional growth.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Aloha liebe Grappler und
Grapplerinnen,</b></p>
<p>Du kannst Grapplers Paradise seit über 1 ½ Jahren
als Blog lesen und das Online Magazin Grapplers Paradise hat inzwischen 3 Ausgaben. Kurz: wir halten schon länger durch als die meisten Schwergewichte in einem 15 Minuten
Kampf. Doch wer ein Magazin gründet, muss sich früher oder später Gedanken
darüber machen wo es hingehen soll, wir haben erst mal gemacht, und mehr
gemacht und werden auch weiter machen, aber damit es richtig weitergehen kann,
müssen wir ein paar Sachen ändern.</p>
<p>Wenn Dir gefällt was Du liest und
Dich fragst, wie kann ich ein cooles Shirt bekommen und noch dazu einen guten Beitrag für ein Grapplers Paradise leisten, bist du hier richtig. Du kannst unser Projekt unterstützen indem Du Dir eins unserer ‘Lean Mean Submission Machine’ T-Shirt “erspendest”.
</p>
<p>Die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten
wie Du, oder Dein Gym uns unterstützen könnt, siehst Du rechts im Menu und wir erklären es
nochmal weiter unten im Text.</p>
<p><b>Lean Mean
Submission Machine </b></p>
<p>Das Design stammt aus unseren Köpfen und um für
höchste Qualität zu sorgen haben wir eine Menge Probeshirts angefordert, bis wir
das richtige gefunden haben. Passend zum Titel des Shirts drucken wir
auf einem enganliegend Shirt aus 100%
Ringspinn-Baumwolle (Hanes).  WICHTIG:
Wirf einen genauen Blick auf die Größentabelle, denn die Shirts fallen
klein aus.</p>
<p>Die Fakten:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design für Gym, wie auch Straße</li>
<li>Shirt
     aus verifizierter Bio-Baumwolle</li>
<li>Enganliegend und somit
     auch als Sportshirt verwendbar</li>
<li>Zeig das Du eine Lean Mean Submission Machine bist!</li>
</ul>
<p>Zu jedem T-Shirt gibt es zudem noch einen kleinen
Stapel Postkarten, sowie Aufkleber mit dem Design des Shirts, sowie natürlich
ein großes Dankeschön für Deine Unterstützung.</p>

Grapplerinnen,
Du kannst Grapplers Paradise seit über 1 ½ Jahren
als Blog lesen und das Online Magazin Grapplers Paradise hat inzwischen 3 Ausgaben. Kurz: wir halten schon länger durch als die meisten Schwergewichte in einem 15 Minuten
Kampf. Doch wer ein Magazin gründet, muss sich früher oder später Gedanken
darüber machen wo es hingehen soll, wir haben erst mal gemacht, und mehr
gemacht und werden auch weiter machen, aber damit es richtig weitergehen kann,
müssen wir ein paar Sachen ändern.
Wenn Dir gefällt was Du liest und
Dich fragst, wie kann ich ein cooles Shirt bekommen und noch dazu einen guten Beitrag für ein Grapplers Paradise leisten, bist du hier richtig. Du kannst unser Projekt unterstützen indem Du Dir eins unserer ‘Lean Mean Submission Machine’ T-Shirt “erspendest”.

Die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten
wie Du, oder Dein Gym uns unterstützen könnt, siehst Du rechts im Menu und wir erklären es
nochmal weiter unten im Text.
Lean Mean
Submission Machine 
Das Design stammt aus unseren Köpfen und um für
höchste Qualität zu sorgen haben wir eine Menge Probeshirts angefordert, bis wir
das richtige gefunden haben. Passend zum Titel des Shirts drucken wir
auf einem enganliegend Shirt aus 100%
Ringspinn-Baumwolle (Hanes).  WICHTIG:
Wirf einen genauen Blick auf die Größentabelle, denn die Shirts fallen
klein aus.
Die Fakten:

Design für Gym, wie auch Straße
Shirt
     aus verifizierter Bio-Baumwolle
Enganliegend und somit
     auch als Sportshirt verwendbar
Zeig das Du eine Lean Mean Submission Machine bist!

the functional system of the modern world we help improve our economic and
commercial system (eg PayPal only introduces the possibility to use its payment
services in Moldova. Looking forward to the opportunity of receiving payments).
Unfortunately, the conditions of the unit export are not established by the law
properly, especially online sales abroad. In this regard, the last 3 months,
together with law firms, we found the only way of such possibility, namely,
making invoices and customs declaration for each package you ordered. However,
with your help, we’ll be able to provide this wonderful product, and other
products of natural sheep wool on more favorable terms. We will continue to
hold discussions with the tax authorities to speed up the development of legislation
that will simplify this task, and allow the whole world to learn about the
products of Moldova and its remarkable natural qualities.At this point we are ready to take the first orders, and it will be just you!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>We are Top &amp; Derby, and we make canes.</strong></h2>
<p>For hundreds of years, walking sticks were common fashion accessories which were made and worn with pride. But as time went on, the aesthetics were abandoned and the finely crafted artifacts were replaced with cold, clinical, and impersonal items of utility. Today, most canes do little to inspire the self-confidence of those who use them. We aim to change this.</p>

<h3><strong>Overview: Check it….</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine if you had to use a cane: <em>How would you feel? How would other people perceive you?</em></p>
<p>At Top &amp; Derby, we don’t think that anyone should have to walk around with a gnarly looking cane; it’s just not fair. We aren’t reinventing the wheel, we’re just designing beautiful canes that people are proud to own; it’s that simple.</p>
<p><img alt=""Top &amp; Derby - 3 canes leaning against wall"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/724016/pictures/full/20130325220040-3_leaning_on_wall.jpg?1364274048"" src="""" style="""" title=""Top &amp; Derby - 3 canes leaning against wall""/></p>
<p>Since the spring of 2011, we’ve designed and built countless iterations and prototypes. In doing so, we created a simple cane constructed of premium materials that will benefit a wide demographic of people. After getting feedback directly from cane users, we decided to move forward with our first model, the Chatfield. The reality is that canes are used by many different people…it’s not just your grandma or grandpa who carries a cane. Think about it; injured athletes, post-operative patients, and yes, even celebrities like Brad Pitt, use walking canes when required.</p>
<p><img alt=""Top &amp; Derby - People with canes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/724025/pictures/full/20130325220409-people_with_canes.jpg?1364274252"" src="""" style="""" title=""Top &amp; Derby - People with canes""/></p>
<p>So now, we need your help. The Chatfield will be manufactured in North America, which we think is pretty rad. We’ve already established our manufacturing partnerships, and now we’d like to order our first production run of canes – with your help. By supporting us in our initiative, you can help us bring this vision to life. Let’s make canes fun again – together. Go talk to your grandma, go talk to your friend that busted her ankle doing the Harlem Shake, and let’s get people canes that they are proud to own.

<p>Why carry a cane, when you can wear it.</p>
<p>We appreciate your support,</p>
<p>T&amp;D</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Cane</strong></h3>
<p><em>Handle</em></p>
<p>We start with a rigid core as the foundation for our cane handle. It’s cast in aluminum and then heat-treated, which produces an extremely durable, yet lightweight frame to build upon. The core is then over-molded with silicone, forming a soft continuous grip that conforms to your hand and dampens vibrations while you walk.</p>
<p><img alt=""Top &amp; Derby - Black cane handle"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/724020/pictures/full/20130325220235-handle_black.jpg?1364274161"" src="""" style="""" title=""Top &amp; Derby - Black cane handle""/></p>
<p>The finished handle has a distinct upturned nose which is comfortable to hold and intuitively positions the hand directly over the wood shaft. This unique detail also allows the cane to effortlessly rest against a wall for quick access; it can be propped up on its nose or side, without the cane slipping or falling over as easily as generic canes often do.</p>
<p><img alt=""Top &amp; Derby - Red cane leaning against wall"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/724022/pictures/full/20130325220300-handle.jpg?1364274183"" src="""" style="""" title=""Top &amp; Derby - Red cane leaning against wall""/></p>
<p><em>Shaft</em></p>
<p>The shaft is turned from solid American black walnut and finished with a durable coating to protect the wood and bring out the natural variation in the grain. We seal the deal by marking it with a laser engraved logo; this way you know it’s an authentic Top &amp; Derby product.</p>

<p><em>Shoe</em></p>
<p>The tip of the cane, or “shoe” as we like to call it, has a sneaker-inspired sole that’s molded in an abrasion resistant thermoplastic rubber. Overall, it’s replaceable, compact and sleek, and works great in a range of different conditions. We’re pretty sure your friends won’t have sneaker-inspired “shoes” on their canes.</p>

<h3><strong>Team: Our story…who is behind Top &amp; Derby?</strong></h3>
<p>Your product doesn’t determine your success; your team does.</p>
<p><strong>Our story is simple:</strong> After having worked together for over 5 years, doing different aspects of product design and retail store design for one of North America’s most successful furniture manufacturers and retailers, we (Matthew Kroeker, Gerrit de Vries, and Ben Grynol) started collaborating to undertake small design projects together. By the spring of 2011, Top &amp; Derby was born, with the vision of disrupting a stagnant industry that lacks innovation.</p>
<p>As a team, we each have over 10 years of experience in different aspects of entrepreneurship, design, and business. Gerrit and Ben both have degrees in design, as well as MBAs from top-tiered Business schools, and Matthew has a degree in Industrial Design from one of North America's most prominent Design schools. Additionally, we are very fortunate to have two of the world’s leading business and design strategists, Roger Martin and Alexander Manu, as our advisors.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we are passionate about improving people’s lives by designing products that matter…and this is just the beginning.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What we need &amp; what you’ll get</strong></h3>
<p>After spending lots of time prototyping different models of canes, we are now at the point where we are ready to manufacture the product. With your support, we will be using the funds raised to set up molds for manufacturing, order our cane parts, and assemble and package each cane by hand in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Our goal, however, is to ship products to supporters by September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2013. Regardless, we will update each supporter with our progress throughout the journey - you are part of the journey, and your support will help Top &amp; Derby achieve its success!</p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Mitigation Strategy</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Risk 1:</strong> We raise a higher level of funds than expected and cannot keep up with demand.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Strategy: </strong>Since we have spent almost two years developing many different models of canes, we have worked with many reputable manufacturers throughout North America. In doing so, we are aware of the maximum capacity of products that each of our manufacturing partners can supply us with on a monthly basis. Overall, the amount of product that each manufacturer can supply us with significantly exceeds our forecasted demand for our initial products.</p>
<p><strong>Risk 2: </strong>Our production costs are higher than expected, and we can’t deliver the product.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Strategy</strong>: In working with many different manufacturers to develop our canes, we have secured pricing for the production costs of our canes. Additionally, we have taken into account all of the extra costs that go into creating high quality products, such as finishing costs, packaging costs, and shipping costs.</p>
<p><strong>Risk 3: </strong>Our production run of canes does not meet our standards.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Strategy: </strong>Since we are all meticulous designers first and business people second, we do not settle for mediocrity. We can ensure that we will only ship the highest quality products to our supporters. If that means delaying production to get the right product out the door, we will do that – and we will let you know along the way through our progress updates. However, since we’ve been sourcing products from many different manufacturers over the past 18 months, the samples we’ve received to date have exceeded our expectations; we hope to exceed yours.</p>

<p><strong><em>How can I contact you?</em></strong></p>
<p>Drop us a line at info@topandderby.com!</p>
<p><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is your cane made of?</em></p>
<p>See the section titled <em>“The Cane”</em> above.</p>
<p><strong><em>What colours does the cane come in?</em></strong></p>
<p>Our cane comes in three colours: Lights-out Black, On-the-vine Red, and Crybaby Blue.</p>
<p><strong><em>What sizes does the cane come in? </em></strong></p>
<p>Our cane comes in four sizes. The cane is fixed in length and non-adjustable, so use the chart below to find your size.</p>
<p><img alt=""Top &amp; Derby - Cane Sizing Chart"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/810859/pictures/full/20130514225156-Top___Derby_size_chart.jpg?1368597119"" src="""" style="""" title=""Top &amp; Derby - Cane Sizing Chart""/></p>
<p><strong><em>How do I know what size cane I will need?</em></strong></p>
<p>Please see the sizing chart above in the FAQ “<em>What sizes does the cane come in?”.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Are your canes adjustable?</em></strong></p>
<p>Since the canes are made with solid walnut shafts, they are not adjustable and should not be cut to adjust the height. Each cane “shoe” (tip) will fit only on the end of the manufactured shaft, since it is a custom part which is made specifically for the cane.</p>
<p><strong><em>How much weight can be supported by the cane?</em></strong></p>
<p>Although the cane has not yet been tested by a third party to certify the maximum weight requirements that it can hold, we have tested the cane for weight and durability within our prototyping studio. However, a cane is not a device that is meant to support a person’s weight. Rather, it is meant to be used to assist a person with his or her balance, when required.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where will the cane be made?</em></strong></p>
<p>All of the cane parts will be manufactured at different facilities throughout Canada and the USA. However, the full cane will be assembled, finished, and packaged in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada – home of Top &amp; Derby.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where are you located?</em></strong></p>
<p>Top &amp; Derby is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.</p>

Risks & Mitigation Strategy
Risk 1: We raise a higher level of funds than expected and cannot keep up with demand.
Mitigation Strategy: Since we have spent almost two years developing many different models of canes, we have worked with many reputable manufacturers throughout North America. In doing so, we are aware of the maximum capacity of products that each of our manufacturing partners can supply us with on a monthly basis. Overall, the amount of product that each manufacturer can supply us with significantly exceeds our forecasted demand for our initial products.
Risk 2: Our production costs are higher than expected, and we can’t deliver the product.
Mitigation Strategy: In working with many different manufacturers to develop our canes, we have secured pricing for the production costs of our canes. Additionally, we have taken into account all of the extra costs that go into creating high quality products, such as finishing costs, packaging costs, and shipping costs.
Risk 3: Our production run of canes does not meet our standards.
Mitigation Strategy: Since we are all meticulous designers first and business people second, we do not settle for mediocrity. We can ensure that we will only ship the highest quality products to our supporters. If that means delaying production to get the right product out the door, we will do that – and we will let you know along the way through our progress updates. However, since we’ve been sourcing products from many different manufacturers over the past 18 months, the samples we’ve received to date have exceeded our expectations; we hope to exceed yours.
 
FAQs
How can I contact you?
Drop us a line at info@topandderby.com!
What is your cane made of?
See the section titled “The Cane” above.
What colours does the cane come in?
Our cane comes in three colours: Lights-out Black, On-the-vine Red, and Crybaby Blue.
What sizes does the cane come in? 
Our cane comes in four sizes. The cane is fixed in length and non-adjustable, so use the chart below to find your size.

How do I know what size cane I will need?
Please see the sizing chart above in the FAQ “What sizes does the cane come in?”.
Are your canes adjustable?
Since the canes are made with solid walnut shafts, they are not adjustable and should not be cut to adjust the height. Each cane “shoe” (tip) will fit only on the end of the manufactured shaft, since it is a custom part which is made specifically for the cane.
How much weight can be supported by the cane?
Although the cane has not yet been tested by a third party to certify the maximum weight requirements that it can hold, we have tested the cane for weight and durability within our prototyping studio. However, a cane is not a device that is meant to support a person’s weight. Rather, it is meant to be used to assist a person with his or her balance, when required.
Where will the cane be made?
All of the cane parts will be manufactured at different facilities throughout Canada and the USA. However, the full cane will be assembled, finished, and packaged in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada – home of Top & Derby.
Where are you located?
Top & Derby is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
Why did you start Top & Derby?
We started Top & Derby to improve people’s lives, to design products that matter, and to disrupt a stagnant industry.
Who founded Top & Derby?
The company was founded by Gerrit de Vries, Matthew Kroeker, and Ben Grynol.
When did Top & Derby start?
Top & Derby was founded in the spring of 2011.
When will you be shipping product?
We expect to ship product to our supporters by September 30th, 2013.
Will I receive updates about the progress of Top & Derby over the course of the next few months?
You bet!
How will the funds be used?
Please see the section above, titled: “What we need & what you’ll get”.
I am a retailer / wholesale distributor; can I carry your canes? 
Yes, once we have fulfilled the orders of our supporters, we will be making product available to retailers and wholesale distributors.
Do you ship internationally?
We are currently only shipping to Canada and the US. We plan to ship internationally in the future.
How can I help?
Any word you can spread to family and friends would be a huge help and much appreciated! Even if you don’t need a cane, you can order one because they are seriously so fun to walk with! As well, you can spread the word on social media using the hashtag #topandderby, and we’ll keep an eye on your posts!",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Here's the Story:</strong></p>
<p>After being featured on TLC's Cake Boss wearing a dress I designed in 2001 I received numerous emails about selling it but I just couldn’t part with the one of a kind creation. However, it made me think.  It’s been 10 long years since my days at <em>Lip Service </em>and I truly miss fashion.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to start by making a sample line of Latex clothing. After my online announcement of this decision I received an offer to be featured in an undisclosed magazine by the end of the summer.</p>
<p><strong>Here is why I need your help:</strong></p>
<p>Latex is not a cheap material and I am unable to obtain it locally. Latex prices range from $8 to $30 a yard before shipping and supplies. Also with latex it’s a one shot fabric. If you cut incorrectly, tear or glue something wrong, it’s over! A whole new piece must be cut. The money donated will go toward fabric, patterns and other materials.</p>
<p>Please help by sending me any spare change you have to make my dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have any spare change its ok! You can help by liking my fan page, instagram and twitter accounts to raise awareness of my arts. You can also share this page!</p>

<p>A LITTLE HISTORY</p>
<p>Scruffy showed up at the door step of my business partner, Steve, about 2 years ago… and he never left.  After unsuccessfully trying to find a bath for Scruffy, the idea for the Barking Bath was formed.  Since then, the bath has gone through several versions and prototypes until we finally hit upon the right formula…  a bath with walls about the height of the dog and a separate floor piece with a latching system to help keep him in.  After we succeeded in building the bath for a small dog, we took it further.  We wanted a bath that a larger dog could simply walk right in - no lifting.  Then we thought about what to do with the bath when not in use - would it just sit in the garage taking up space?  And in its fully assembled state, the shipping costs were a small fortune due to dimensional weight pricing.</p>
<p>Well, we solved all of the problems we identified.  The Barking Bath will ship in a 6 inch high box and that eliminates the extra dimensional weight fees.  It can normally be assembled in about 90 seconds and disassembled just as fast for easy storage.  The Stay Assist feature helps keep your dog in the bath while each end of the bath can be lowered and raised to make it surprisingly easy to bring your dog in and out.</p>
<p>We will build each Barking Bath with quality materials.  Yes, it does cost a little extra to use good materials but we think it’s worth it.  The Barking Bath will last a lifetime - and we are backing it up with a full 5 year warranty that covers all components of the bath - including the vinyl liner!</p>
<p>Since we will be using an ultra strong PVC Frame and an extra thick Vinyl Liner (20mil), there isn’t much chance you’ll ever need to use our 5 year warranty with normal use of the bath - but it’s nice to know that if something does happen, you pay nothing to get it fixed (except shipping costs of course).</p>
<p>The Barking Bath has a drain with a drain cap.  You can use it as a true bath with the cap on.  Or use it like a shower with the cap off for continuous draining.  If you want the water to drain away from the bath, a standard garden hose can be attached to the drain allowing you to drain the bath to any location inside or outside.  And speaking of inside and outside, you can use the Barking Bath anywhere.  Just keep in mind that there is still a possibility of some splashing - so don’t use it near an area that can’t handle a little splash now and then.</p>

<p></p></div>","FEEL THE VYBE
Before you explore any further, we wanted to tell you thanks for stopping by our page. Hopefully you share the vision with us to revolutionize the eyewear industry with our patent-pending product.Vybe Sunglasses are the world’s first pair of
interchangeable and customizable sunglasses. The entire body of the sunglasses is interchangeable including the ears, arms, frames, and polarized lenses.Vybe's have a twelve color palette and eight different lens choices which allows
you to customize your pair to your favorite sports team’s colors, your college
university’s colors, or your outfit. The best part is you don’t have to buy a
whole new pair to switch up the look of the glasses. Just go buy individual
pieces whenever you are feeling like switching up the colors, and interchange
away.

WHAT IS VYBE ALL ABOUT?Vybe is bringing a taste of personality and creativity that the sunglass industry is currently lacking. With Vybe’s interchangeable features, people can now buy sunglasses that are more in tune with their tastes and their personality.  Vybe’s customizable options allow for over 1.9 million different color combinations, so people can create a pair of sunglasses that is unique to their own tastes. The time is over seeing someone next to you wearing the same shades. BEHIND THE VISIONHow Chase came up with the idea is actually quite simple. He walked out of a typical eyewear retailer unsatisfied with the plain and forgettable shades he had bought (which not to mention costed over $200). Chase got home, emailed the eyewear store he had just left asking for a few custom pairs he thought would look unique that weren't available on their site or in the store. After receiving an automated response from a cliché ""customer representative"", the idea for Vybe was born.That night Chase spent hours sketching up designs on his kitchen table expanding on his idea (literally).Prototype made out of post office boxes.First 3-D printed prototype.Second 3-D printed prototype.Third 3-D printed prototype.Sixth and seventh 3-D printed prototypes.Final product.SUNGLASSES SPECSVybe’s are made of a plastic-blended nylon and its durability and strength is on par with the likes of higher end brands like Oakley and Ray-Ban. These certainly aren’t those $5 shades from that creepy guy at the mall.  Vybe also offers polarized lenses that are both polycarbonate and scratch-resistant.
12 available colors for each part of the sunglass frame
8 polarized lens options
Dimensions of the sunglasses in millimeters.PROGRESSIONTIMELINE

<p>We need your support in launching our truly innovative collection that will disrupt the Men's Underwear Industry. </p>
<p>The SilkSuit LLC is proud to offer the ultimate underwear experience for Men.  We created a new revolutionary innovation that is simple, elegant, sexy and may provide a solution to increase and reinvigorate lost virility. </p>
<p>It's going to make you laugh - so do so. It's funny so you should be laughing. We do. Make note of the energy this brings when you tell friends!</p>
<p>It's Here. Custom Fit Men's Anatomical Underwear</p>
<p>We have to be a little crazy obviously, but the background of the company is in designing, developing, selling and implementing Custom Global Trading Systems for Financial Services, literally, all over the world. Groomed in systems and efficiency, a best friend and I found a flaw in Men's Underwear and were immediately convinced we had something. </p>
<p>After all, I wear socks and STILL have a callous on <strong>both</strong> big toes! So being circumcised, not covering the little guy <em>had</em> to have an effect - and not a good one. Logical right?</p>
<p><strong>WHY THE SILK SUIT?</strong></p>
<p>This flaw is an opportunity to educate, and provide a solution to hundreds of millions of Men, creating a new market within the global men’s underwear industry. <br/> For Men, the pleasure ""control center"", the Glans, the head constantly rubs against the underwear. We call this the ‘<strong><em>sandpaper effect</em></strong>’. </p>
<p>Due to this constant, day after day, week after week, Year after Year, DECADE AFTER DECADE subtle abrasion - this ""sandpaper effect"" causes the delicate nerve endings and blood vessels that are the source of the pleasure sensation for men, to move further and further away from the surface - forming, essentially, a ""<em>callous</em>"". A layer of Keratin (protein in hair and nails) forms just beneath the skin. </p>
<p>This thickness causes a loss of sensation. The new sensations don't ""tickle"" but a deeper more satisfying experience. An example is putting a supercharger or turbos on a muscle car. Does it <strong>need</strong> it? Maybe not, but superchargers and turbos are cool and make the muscle car perform even better. That's the essence of the SilkSuit.</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>The SilkSuit is Custom Fit Anatomical Men’s Underwear, a double layered sheath of the finest stretchable, breathable fabric. Like a second skin. The SilkSack is a pouch of the same fabric for the ‘boys’. The SilkSuit stays on by super soft secure Baby elastic. (Ever see a baby with <em><strong>blue feet</strong></em>?)</p>
<p>The SilkSuit+ comes with an opening to make going to the bathroom simple and quick.</p>
<p>The SilkSuit is custom fit like an expensive Suit tailored to fit your body – made for you!</p>
<p><strong>Athletes and Active Lifestyles!</strong></p>
<p>A this is huge for you. jockstraps are abrasive. Burlap. change it up and experience that extra boost of 'young legs', extra energy like Pacino in ""Raging Bull"" (no foolin around before a fight!), bounce in your toes! That kind of energy or 'extra step'. </p>
<p>Hey NIKE! Are you there?! (two layers means - NFL, NHL, NCAA, MLB, and even English Premiere League Football!) The SilkSuit is the 'new jockstap'! with logos! Let's GO! </p>

This project was TOO HOT for Kickstarter! GOGO INDIEGOGO!
Once the campaign has closed you will receive a link and credentials to log in to the site (pre launch) to enter your sizes and mailing information. We'll keep you informed with the status of your order via email.

<h3>Carry Out Missions in the Final Frontier!</h3>
<p>Starships &amp; Spacemen was first released back in 1978, and only the second science fiction RPG in development in the early 70s.</p>
<p>This second edition of the classic game is compatible with Labyrinth Lord and Mutant Future. The best elements of the first edition have been kept--the classes and subclasses, the excellent starship rules, and the space adventuring rules. Classes, races, and abilities have been made more in line with Labyrinth Lord.</p>
<p>This second edition has elements that let you customize the style of play whether you prefer an ""original series"" feel, a ""next generation"" feel, or something in between.</p>
<p>You won't be bogged down by an over-complicated and detailed galaxy. That's one of the difficulties sometimes when trying to play in an established licensed universe. With Starships &amp; Spacemen get just enough information to get going, and plenty of advice for designing your galaxy. Galactic space will be yours to customize.</p>
Much like in Labyrinth Lord, in Starships &amp; Spacemen you design your milieu. This is adventuring in space, not History 101!</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>There are different funding levels to accommodate different interests. In addition to the Starships &amp; Spacemen book, we have purchased the rights to the Bridge Crew line of miniatures, which are available at certain funding levels for those interested. (See below for photos.)</p>

<p>Idea about Easy Life Belt was born when i had enough feeling that classic belt limited me in my work and sport activities. Than we found out that people sit more and more each day - some of us even 14 hours a day. Based on this finding we immediately started to work. After a number of trials we created unique Gipsy and Clown belt – Easy Life Belt MAGNETIC!</p>
<p>This belt is the only belt in the world, which has inserted the elastic part. The elastic part is located at the front of the belt, because in that part of the body the physical workload is the biggest.

I found manufacturer of high quality military cotton webbing and experts who helped me to develop unique durable elastic part of the belt (which was developed for this belt only).</p>
<p>I and my friends tested this belt for more than one year. They were all impressed about it and they would not replace it any more for the ordinary belt. When the belt received first positive feedback and fans, it was time for a design. The belt is designed with a lot of sense and love for street wear. </p>

HOW IT WORKS!
 





 





How do you measure your waist?
Making Sure you are NOT wearing a belt while doing this, put a measuring tape through your pant/skirt loops and wrap it around your waist. Because you don’t want your new belt to interfere with your breath, inhale deeply and then measure your girth. Where the tape end meets the rest of the band, you will read your bodily circumference. That will be the size you need to provide when ordering your new belt.

</div><p>From a young age
I felt pressure from family and friends to exceed expectations
when it came to pursuing a career. My mother implored me to seek routine and
stability while my father pushed me to aim for wherever higher education could
lead. Instead I chose to pursue happiness - whatever that meant for me. On my
journey I was able to launch a successful eBay handbag company through
partnerships with street vendors, work in high-end retail stores and even
become the face for a few beauty and fashion lines as a model. I finally found
my calling when I had the opportunity to work with a well-established jewelry
designer. I was able to have hands on involvement with a growing company. I
used this time to groom my design aesthetic and to soak up knowledge on running
a succesful business. My most important lesson was that you <strong>cannot</strong> do it alone. I have
realized that my happiness comes from the pursuit of my best self. I am
Veronika and with your help I am commited to creating a life Unrivaled.</p><div>
</div><div>
</div><p align=""center""><strong>why wear Veronika?</strong></p><div>At the core of my brand is
a desire to build a world that reflects my perspective. I<span> </span><span>am most fulfilled when I am able to bring a piece from conception to tangible form. </span><span>I challenge myself to
share my life experiences, belief system, fashion sense and whimsical thoughts
with each piece of jewelry. Every
piece is designed and assembled by me and an intimate team. They are each customizable with the ability to reflect the individual owner. Because my material
(fur) cannot be duplicated, like you, each piece is one of a kind. </span>

</div></div>","From a young age
I felt pressure from family and friends to exceed expectations
when it came to pursuing a career. My mother implored me to seek routine and
stability while my father pushed me to aim for wherever higher education could
lead. Instead I chose to pursue happiness - whatever that meant for me. On my
journey I was able to launch a successful eBay handbag company through
partnerships with street vendors, work in high-end retail stores and even
become the face for a few beauty and fashion lines as a model. I finally found
my calling when I had the opportunity to work with a well-established jewelry
designer. I was able to have hands on involvement with a growing company. I
used this time to groom my design aesthetic and to soak up knowledge on running
a succesful business. My most important lesson was that you cannot do it alone. I have
realized that my happiness comes from the pursuit of my best self. I am
Veronika and with your help I am commited to creating a life Unrivaled.

why wear Veronika?At the core of my brand is
a desire to build a world that reflects my perspective. I am most fulfilled when I am able to bring a piece from conception to tangible form. I challenge myself to
share my life experiences, belief system, fashion sense and whimsical thoughts
with each piece of jewelry. Every
piece is designed and assembled by me and an intimate team. They are each customizable with the ability to reflect the individual owner. Because my material
(fur) cannot be duplicated, like you, each piece is one of a kind. 
                                                                                                                             The Ring         The Ring, where a woman keeps her heart. A symbolism of love. A promise to                                                    herself or to the love of her life.               - My promise is to live each day faithfully walking in my purpose.
                                                                
Triangle, symbol of intelligence, power, change,  love and femininity. All characteristics that are needed to build and maintain an Unrivaled life, but that may take a lifetime to achieve.

     
      The Vial     


Where a woman keeps the things which are closest to her ... closest to her heart. Her magic, her secrets, her unique charm.
- My magic comes from every person I encounter. From exploring the world and from gaining a better understanding of myself and my passions.


Eygptian Carotouche, worn by Pharoahs and people of royal descent. Characteristics that set individuals apart. Every person carries with them a rich story and history.
The Dagger

Where a woman keeps her strength. The woman who is a warrior.

- My strength comes from those before me who have instilled in me the passion to create and live an Unrivaled life.
Success
The Vial by Veronika made its debut on E's nationally televised ""Fashion Police"". With your help more of these moments can be achieved!

He grew up in a remote rural village in Ghana and was the first in his family line to learn to read and write. Now, a generation later, I am lucky enough to live in one of the greatest cities in the world, London.Following a trip to South Africa my wife and I saw first-hand the challenges that some children face in getting access to education. Food and clothing is important, but without education there is little chance of these children breaking out of the cycle of poverty that they find themselves trapped in.One child we met had witnessed his father get stabbed to death in front of him. His mother couldn’t afford a school uniform or other resources, denting his confidence and leading to truancy.That all changed with a new school uniform. He found the confidence he needed to attend school and is now well on his way towards gaining an education.From the profit on every watch sold, we provide two sets of school uniform to children caught in poverty in South Africa, with the aim of expanding across more of the continent. Last year alone, Vitae supplied over 1,000 school uniforms.Our dream for this year is to help build schools and improve the lives of more children than ever before. That's where you come in.By pre-ordering a classic Vitae watch, you're investing in lasting style and making a real social impact. VITAE WATCHESVitae London is a watch brand that designs elegant watches at affordable prices.Design - Born of LondonOur classic watch designs are heavily influenced by London’s rich heritage, style and culture. This amazing city exudes class and sophistication, and that’s what our watches represent.I love London. The amazing mix of people. The open and accepting culture. The rich and varied history. The blend of the classic and contemporary. Even the architecture is inspiring.I wanted to incorporate all of these elements into simple, clean, elegant designs. Watches born not just in London, but of London - capturing that classic London feel.It was also important to us that our design stay true to the classic, minimalist look so that they can be worn by anyone in any situation. Whether attending a film premier in Leicester Square or running the London Marathon - Vitae watches are elegant yet durable. The FaceA sleek, round, contemporary face design with minimalist features to avoid clutter.A watch face is arguably the most important aspect of the design. Vitae watches take a minimalist approach to our watch face design, stripping back the clutter to give an elegant, refined feel.The round face with sloping lugs brings symmetry to the design, forming the watch around the shape of your wrist.Dials and hands are colour-matched with your choice of metal for an effortlessly bold look, while a soft bevel on the sleek, pointed hands captures the light for a distinguished finish.A small date window has been intricately crafted into one side of the watch face to provide added functionality while maintaining the minimalist style.Finally, the Vitae logo - our guarantee of quality - is discretely placed in the 12 o’clock position to preserve the symmetrical balance of the design. The StrapOur finely-knit, stainless steel Milanese straps give our classic watches a contemporary finish. Artisans of Milan - once famous for their fine chain-mail armour - now turn their hands to create these fine-knit metal watch bracelets.

I am Derek. I am the chief designer and founder of Mirabilio. </p><p>I set out with a curiosity. A curiosity about our own ""human"" experience. With a fascination for how we express our identity and how our mood influences the way we perceive life. As a mountain biker, I’ve always felt the presence of nature as I ride through the woods. I feel joyful and free. This mindset in combination with being in nature led me to see how closely connected we are to the natural-world. I then began to integrate elements found in nature with style, as an expression of personal identity.</p><p>In creating the Mirabilio brand, I held a goal… a vision… an ideal in my mind. That I want to change the way people look and feel about themselves. I believe one can achieve lasting change through introspection, positive affirmations, self-awareness, gratitude, abundance, and faith.</p><p>My designs are grounded in the belief that, “our thoughts create our reality.” Knowing what we wear portrays an image that influences our thoughts and perspectives about ourselves. As a designer my purpose is to use my gift to help others design a positive change in the way they see themselves.</p><p>What evolved is a brand distinctly unique for the introspective soul seeking to express a personal identity, that is spiritually powerful and physically grounded. Mirabilio is a collection of one-of-a-kind natural elements &amp; individually hand-burned wooden accents, that connect you with the outdoors. The entire brand is centered around a deeper connection to ‘self…’ and the connections we have to the natural world.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594482531/kyxca1wsgaukovnc6usc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>PROJECTS</h3><p>The Mirabilio collection comes together through 3 Projects:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>I AM PROJECT</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">First the I AM PROJECT, which is the heart and soul of the Mirabilio brand.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">This Project helps you to take your mind to quieter, calmer levels of thinking.

I am Derek. I am the chief designer and founder of Mirabilio. I set out with a curiosity. A curiosity about our own ""human"" experience. With a fascination for how we express our identity and how our mood influences the way we perceive life. As a mountain biker, I’ve always felt the presence of nature as I ride through the woods. I feel joyful and free. This mindset in combination with being in nature led me to see how closely connected we are to the natural-world. I then began to integrate elements found in nature with style, as an expression of personal identity.In creating the Mirabilio brand, I held a goal… a vision… an ideal in my mind. That I want to change the way people look and feel about themselves. I believe one can achieve lasting change through introspection, positive affirmations, self-awareness, gratitude, abundance, and faith.My designs are grounded in the belief that, “our thoughts create our reality.” Knowing what we wear portrays an image that influences our thoughts and perspectives about ourselves. As a designer my purpose is to use my gift to help others design a positive change in the way they see themselves.What evolved is a brand distinctly unique for the introspective soul seeking to express a personal identity, that is spiritually powerful and physically grounded. Mirabilio is a collection of one-of-a-kind natural elements & individually hand-burned wooden accents, that connect you with the outdoors. The entire brand is centered around a deeper connection to ‘self…’ and the connections we have to the natural world. PROJECTSThe Mirabilio collection comes together through 3 Projects:I AM PROJECTFirst the I AM PROJECT, which is the heart and soul of the Mirabilio brand.This Project helps you to take your mind to quieter, calmer levels of thinking. Every element focuses your thoughts and centers your awareness. It is meant to guide you toward mental clarity and stillness. When you are seeking support, love, or protection, the I AM PROJECT may be a great fit for how you express the true power of your inner-self.ATMAN PROJECTThe second, is the ATMAN PROJECT, which is a collection of concept and limited edition designs. So named for its uniqueness as Atman is the spiritual life principle of the universe. In essence, it is your soul.ABUNDANCE PROJECTFinally, the ABUNDANCE PROJECT is our way of giving to the community. This is how Mirabilio supports impactful social projects.   And so… here is where we’re at…The full product line is operational. The website, social media, distribution systems… are all set up. We’re already selling direct to you (the individual) and boutiques.Here’s where you come in. Mirabilio has been asked to be a vendor at one of the largest fashion trade-shows in NYC, called FAME!   WE ARE IN!    September 1, 2020 is the Show!This is happening and I couldn’t be more excited!Life is Good! Like Paulo Coelho famously wrote — “And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”Here is what I’m asking the Universe to provide, in order to make this trade show a success!

<p>When we first imagined the Terrain Pant we began by asking ourselves, If we could take only one pair of pants on a trip around the world, what would they be, and how would they be different? </p>
<p>The Terrain Pant is made with Nano-Wing® twill that performs better than a technical nylon fabric, dries 40% faster than standard material, repels odor and wicks moisture, is self-cleaning, stain and water-resistant, easy-wearing, and built to last.</p>

THE ULTIMATE PANT FOR TRAVEL, OUTDOORS, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN
When we first imagined the Terrain Pant we began by asking ourselves, If we could take only one pair of pants on a trip around the world, what would they be, and how would they be different? 
The Terrain Pant is made with Nano-Wing® twill that performs better than a technical nylon fabric, dries 40% faster than standard material, repels odor and wicks moisture, is self-cleaning, stain and water-resistant, easy-wearing, and built to last.

 






 

Since Nano-Wing® fabric repels moisture, your perspiration evaporates through the breathable fabric leaving your clothes smelling fresh even after vigorous activity. And when light hits the fabric it activates anti-microbial CATLIGHT® technology, keeping your pants cleaner for longer without washing. 
Available in:
 Color: Olive, Navy, and Charcoal
 Sizes: 28-40 
 Inseam: Short 30 inches, Regular 32 inches, Long 36 inches.
 


 
The meticulous design and craft that go into making the Terrain Pant great for travel, also make it the perfect pant for every occasion, from the outdoors, to work, to around town. Versatility means everyday, any weather, everywhere. 


The fit is tailored and tapered to look sharp around town, but roomie enough to allow you to move freely when on active adventures. 


Our Japanese made, Nano-Wing® Technology fabric is Bluesign® Certified 

Water-Repellant
Stain-Repellant
 Quick-Drying: Dries 40% faster than standard materials
 Odor Resistant: wicks and evaporates perspiration. 
 Self-Cleaning: When light hits the fabric it activates the anti-microbial CATLIGHT® technology. Keeping your clothes fresh on long journeys and active adventures. 
 UV Protected: the Nano-Wing® fibers are specially cut and spun to capture UV rays, reducing thermal transmission, and keeping you cool while you perform. 
 2-Way Stretch: So your pants move with you.
 Light weight: Our uniquely woven premium cotton and elastane fibers make for a pant that is half the weight of jeans. 


The front button is custom-made in Italy to be more durable than standard acrylic buttons. The double slot design originated by the Canadian military, allows us to attach the button with mil-spec nylon twill. 

American made ballistic nylon tab for snapback closure, gives you quick, durable, and secure access to your wallet. 

We believe that our pants help our supporters enjoy all our earth has to offer, so it's our responsibility to do what we can to protect it. 
We are committed to creating the Terrain Pant with sustainable and ethical practices along the entire supply chain, from no-waste crowdsourcing, to certifiedenvironmentally friendly fabric, to American manufacturing, to compostable packaging. 

We craft our pants in America in a family-owned workshop where our skilled sewers are paid on average 200% above California minimum wage. 
Our Japanese made, Nano-Wing® Technology fabric is treated with an environmentally friendly C6 Durable Water Repellant finish and is Bluesign certified. 

Why Bluesign? The Bluesign® system regulates and reduces environmental impact through the entire textile supply chain from yarn to the finished product. The system reviews the use of chemistry, energy usage, water and air emissions, worker and consumer safety.  Bluesign Technologies encourages the entire textile industry to increase their efforts towards sustainability and reducing their environmental impact across the entire supply chain.


 NO WASTE = RADICAL VALUE
By backing our project you help us line up supply and demand. We don't have inventory piling up in a warehouse and wasteful marketing campaigns to convince you to buy what we already made. We pass that savings back to you. Unlike other brands that cut out the middle-man but keep the savings, you're getting world-class gear at significant savings. We know because our designers used to be in the mainstream apparel industry. 

 
Rivas Supply is led by the brother/sister team of Liam and Ceara McAuliffe. Born and raised in Venice, CA, they have spent the last five years designing and bringing to market over 30 styles combining cutting edge technical materials, Made in America quality, and contemporary style. 
We founded Rivas to help define the future of American made apparel.  We believe in making smarter, more sustainable apparel, so you can buy less and enjoy for longer. 


Because our Terrain Pant is made with a Durable Water Repellent application, they will absorb less odor and stains, so they can and should be washed less often. 
Wash with like colors with mild detergent on cold. Tumble dry low or lay flat. Do not use fabric softener during wash since this can  damage the water repellency. Do NOT bleach. Do NOT dry clean.
 
Risks and challenges
We have been in the performance clothing business since 2013, and successfully designed and brought to market over 30 styles. Our team has extensive experience in fabric design and manufacturing high-quality apparel as well as fulfilling lots of orders. 
We have our manufacturers lined-up and waiting for our signal. You can be confident that we will deliver what we promise when we say we will.
Over the years we have dealt with our share of obstacles in the manufacturing process, and always handle them in a transparent, responsible way. Our number one goal is to keep our customers not just happy with their products, but also proud to support us. We take all feedback personally, whether its a high-five or a concerned question. We believe our personal connection to our products and our customers is what makes Rivas Supply strong. 
Supply Chain Risk: We're proud of our supply chain who we've been working with for the last five years. 
We design our products in a studio that's a 15 minute drive from our factory, so we have immediate oversight and quality controls. This gives us confidence that we can make what we say we'll make when we say we'll make it. But sometimes things happen that are simply out of our control, like fabric delays due to yarn being stuck in customs and changing tariff codes. We add time padding for these events, but there's the possibility that it's not enough. If anything should arrive late we will get through it together.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello to all!  My name is Kristina and I'm a senior at Moore College of Art and Design!  For the past 3 years I've been working towards my BFA in fashion design.  Since my sophomore year I've been hard at work learning about diffrent techniques and what goes into being a designer.  I also was lucky enough to spend my summer in New York Interning with <a href=""http://lelarose.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lela Rose</a>.  I even got to help with fashion week.  After learning so much and working in the field, it is now my turn to show the community and the school what I have learned and showcase my own designs that represents me as a designer and as an artist.</p>
<p>I've always been passionate about fashion design, but there has always been something about bridal and wedding gowns that have really interested me.  I want to create a great bridal collection for the average women (or the ones who aren't afraid to take a chance) that's affordable, comfortable and memorable.  A wedding dress is the single most important dress in a woman's life and the most remembered.  My goal is to make something that any women could put on, look in the mirror and think ""Wow, I feel absolutely beautiful"" no matter their size.</p>
<p>That is why I am reaching out to you to help contribute to this idea that I have been pineing after for years.  As a senior I am required to present a collection composed of 3-5 pieces that will be shown at the Moore College of Art and Design annual fashion show. Although I keep a job, I am not able to raise enough money on my own and I could use all the help that I can get for this one!  In the past I have only needed to complete one outfit and this time I could be making as many as 5 gowns for the fashion show (now that's a lot of fabric) There are no more scholarships to apply for and not many other options for a senior in college to receive money so please, help a girl out!  I'm looking to raise about $1000 and with all of your help, we can do it!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, let's look at it this way folks.  This is what goes into making a collection. I'll be needing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 10 yards of fabric somewhere in the $23-34/yd range. Fabric from NYC ain't cheap!</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Lace</li>
<li>Zippers</li>
<li>Thread</li>
<li>Ribbon</li>
<li>Shoes, acessories AND bouquets for the models</li>
<li>Other odds, ends and trims!</li>
</ul>
<p>It really adds up when you take the time to think about it.  A donation of $10 dollars could cover all the buttons for my collection!</p>
<p><strong>But hold on, what's in it for <em>you</em>?</strong></p>

<p>Hi indiegogo community… thank you for visiting my page and checking out my project.</p>
<p>Hoping that along with your individual support you will feel comfortable to help me spread the word through email, twitter, facebook…..</p>
<p><strong>Who I am and how I began designing pet carriers:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jamie – my background includes successful careers in retail management and television sales.  I had a small Yorkshire terrier named Lucy that I would take with me every where.  As Lucy grew older she became quite ill.  She had a degenerative disease that took her sight and she was in kidney failure.  It became more important then ever for me to find a way to keep Lucy by my side as much as possible.  The pet carrier that I owned at the time did not hold its shape and basically screamed “dog bag” so that I wasn’t able to conceal her as much as I would like.  You may have experienced this with your own carrier… when I would put Lucy inside her bag it would collapse all around her causing Lucy to be hot and uncomfortable.  As a result of being unable to find a stylish pet carrier on the market that could accommodate both of our needs, I set out to design the perfect bags.  My designs are unique because they look and function as both an everyday handbag and pet carrier.  In fact you probably wouldn’t even know that there was a pet inside!  In addition to creating structured bags that hold their shape for your pet’s safety (better ventilation) and comfort, I add such features as outside pockets for your personal items, adjustable leash/harness rings, an extra thick pet cushion with a removable and washable lining and a roll down window.  I design my bags to mirror some of the hottest trends in the fashion industry.</p>
<p><strong>My project?  Aspen Tote Carrier…. Where fashion meets function!</strong></p>
<p><strong>To create a light weight <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">high fashion</span> pet carrier that is <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">airline compliant</span>, doubles as both a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">car seat</span> and  <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">handbag</span>, provides a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">safe and comfortable</span> place for your pet, holds your <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">iPad</span> and makes traveling easy by fitting securely on your <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">luggage handle</span>.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Structure of the tote</span>: allows you to place the bag down on a flat surface while dining, shopping, traveling… without it collapsing on your pet… this is better for both comfort and ventilation</strong></p>
<p><strong> What makes the Aspen Tote unique?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Original design/fashion forward/colors and fabrics that are used in the handbag industry</li>
<li>Light weight</li>
<li>Folds flat for shipping and storage</li>
<li>Holds it shape so that you can put it down while dining, shopping, traveling</li>
<li>Mesh top so that it will close completely and be air-line compliant (I always recommend checking with each airline for their specifications before traveling)</li>
<li>Adjustable leash/harness ring (only one in the industry) so that you can control how far your pet’s head can reach outside of the bag for SAFETY</li>
<li>Attachable/adjustable strap to secure to your luggage handle</li>
<li>Tabs to fasten to seatbelt in order to use the bag as a car seat</li>
<li>Shoulder straps are long enough to fit over winter coats as well as summer jackets</li>
<li>Micro-suede lining helps absorb perspiration keeping your pet dry</li>
<li>Extra thick bottom cushion with a removable and machine washable cushion cover</li>
<li>Outside pockets for your personal items</li>
<li>Zippered pocket for your iPad or personal items</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What motivates me?</strong></p>
<p>My passion for animals, love for the fashion industry, a belief in quality products and a high level of customer service…. and most important the incredible feedback that I receive from people all over the world.  There is no greater complement then hearing from customers that use and enjoy my products.  I approach each of my designs with the idea that I am asking a fashion conscious woman to leave her handbag at home and to feel just as proud/confident in my carrier as a reflection of her personal style.  At the same time I am putting extra effort to insure your pet’s safety and comfort. This is what I wrote originally but James’s brother in law switched to below.. do you like below?</p>
<p><strong>Thank YOU for helping this dream come true with indiegogo:</strong></p>
<p>I am motivated by a love of my 2 best friends, Charlie and Spike and knowing that I can improve the travel experience for other pets and hopefully you or someone you love.  I hope that my passion for the fashion industry and belief in quality carriers shines through in each of my designs created.  I want to change the way we look at keeping our beloved friends at our side more often without risking their safety or comfort.  I approach each new carrier with the idea that I am asking a fashion conscious woman to leave her handbag at home and still feel proud/confident in her personal style while being able to bring her best friend along!</p>
<p>I would love to hear from you!  Here are a few kind words from fans of my recent carrier designs.</p>

<p><strong><em>*Jamie - Sammy is a 6.5 pound Yorkie.

<p>*<strong><em>Jamie - OMG these are sooooooo great ! Maggie LOVES the bags and was in them in seconds flat - I think to say MINE MINE MINE. I do get what you are saying about the Lucy - it is big but mostly because I see how you have constructed it to keep the shape. </em></strong><strong><em>You get how to make these function easily as a carrier and purse.

<p><strong><em>*We just landed and Lola couldn't have been better in her new Charlie Carrier. </em></strong><strong><em>Usually she circles and pants sometimes depending on turbulence but all she did this time was circle twice and lay down to sleep.

Thank you so much! We now have a new favorite bag and know we will be flying with it lots! ~Carla, Canada</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>My greatest challenge?</strong></p>
<p>Every small business has the challenge that we can’t get prices down until we get volume up, but we can’t get volume up until we get the prices down (chicken in the egg problem).  Most get stuck either making prices higher at first, or sacrificing quality, or even being pushed to take manufacturing outside of the USA to save dollars.  Your Indiegogo support would allow me to place a larger production order of a min. of 100 Aspen Tote Carriers all at once.  In doing so I will be able to reduce the cost per item and pass this savings on directly to you.  In addition, this larger order will allow me to avoid buying outside of the USA, where we will have the opportunity to put up to 10 unemployed artisans back to work.</p>

REWARDS:  First of all I want to thank everyone for their participation and to remind you that no amount is too small!  The opportunity that indiegogo presents is way beyond my individual project… it is an opportunity for small business and for each of us to support creativity, passion and hard work.
Starting as low as $10 you will receive different Lucy’s Luxuries products.  I have made my squeaky toys, bag blankie/teddy set, note cards, greeting card and even current bag inventory available as rewards.  Best of all… you will have the opportunity to pre-order the brand new Aspen Tote carrier at a significantly reduced cost during this campaign.
Please note:  for all reward options shipping is free within the US
International orders shipping cost are listed.  Items are shipped via the United States Post Office and the price is determined based on weight.

<h3>The deeFind Story</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">Do you know the amount of women in the United States who wear a size 11 shoe?  Well, according to Footwear Market Insights, the number may be surprizing: it's 3%— a statistic that I happen to fall in. Upon my research, the number of  designers who accommodate women with this problem is even lower. And the amount of those companies who manufacture eco-friendly or eco-conscious designer shoes is—sadly—even less. The fashion industry is in dire need of replenishing its inventory of hard-to-find, high-fashion, women's shoes with a </span><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">commitment </span><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">to sustainable manufacturing. I founded deeFind Shoes partially due to my frustration of being a size 11, with slim to no options of finding desirable shoes.  As a purveyor of fashion, I grew more and more frustrated; rather than complain about my dilemma, I decided to take control and employ my creative energy, passion and desire to solve this problem, while achieving my dream of becoming an entrepreneur.  My vision rapidly began to unfold. I developed a line that focuses on hard-to-find shoes from sizes 6 to 12.  Furthering my thought process of brand development, I knew I had to stay true to my identity and morale. The name deeFind emerged from two subjects: my nickname (people call me Dee) and my created treasures, or 'finds'.  What I really want to accomplish with my brand is to offer these shoes as a tool: wearing a beautiful pair of deeFind Shoes could empower women to stand confident, while ferociously approaching their own dreams, head on. deeFind is much more than another shoe company of utility. It is a growing movement of everyday women stepping into the arena of their big dreams.  And from a company perspective, a solid vision involving eco-conscious manufacturing practices with the intention of raising awareness on everything from where our products originate and who is making them, to contributing to solutions to problems immersed in</span><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;""> our community</span><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">. One of the ways that I believe we can improve our community is by cultivating thoughtful design and introducing more sustainable materials into our products. One of our goals is to—eventually—design a fully recyclable high-heel shoe . . . and we are moving steadily in that direction.  Each season we are adding different material applications to help meet this objective.  For our Spring/Summer 2012 collection, we are so proud to announce that our high heels are constructed from recycled tires, our soles are made from recycling old soles, and our boxes and tissue paper are made from recyclable materials.  Additionally, we use a myriad of breathtaking faux leathers; the treatment and methods of the tanning industry can be pretty brutal. In the upcoming seasons, we plan to introduce more sustainable and up-cycled </span><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">leathers</span><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">.  As a startup company, it is exorbitantly expensive to preserve quality, while utilizing sustainable materials, when ordering small quantities. Moreover, larger material orders are sometimes required to access such stunning alternatives, which is nearly impossible with my budget. We are fanatical about the continuation of producing high quality, handmade shoes and expanding on our vision of making a high-fashion high heel that is eco-friendly.  Lastly, deeFind is committed to working within our community. With each season, deeFind takes a percentage of each pair of shoes sold and donates the profits to a special charity. Sleeping sound at night is unachievable without deeFind fulfilling its obligation to return the gift of support to our community, in whatever capacity that may be.  </span></p>

<h3>The Impact Of This Campaign Reaches Many</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">It's no secret that your investment directly benefits deeFind, though, the secondary benefits greatly impact everyone who is linked to this business. deeFind creates jobs for people who share a similar passion. with closely aligned dreams. My Creative Director—Melina Jones—whose vision, skills, dedication and energy are a crucial in keeping the identity of deeFind thriving and alive.  She works endless hours, more than I can afford to pay, because she is a devout believer in the deeFind dream.  Within my community, I network and contract out for photographers, makeup artists, marketing and PR because I want to support individuals and entrepreneurs just like me, chasing after and fighting for their dreams.  We have created opportunities to guide and mentor others who wish to work within the shoe industry. With my manufacturer in Mexico, I am trying to provide workers with a livable wage in relation to their economy so they can help sustain their families.</span></span></p>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: small;"">This business has been an exhausting challenge: pulling dozens of all-nighters, endless hours of research, wearing many different hats—mostly at the same time—all while filling many vacant roles in our company. As a business owner, I have exploited every penny from my bank account to keep this business afloat.  Building a business from the ground up can be challenging—especially when its being constructed grass-roots style with zero capital.  We believe so much in the enormous potential of deeFind, which is why we want the investor to be YOU: The people who believe in my vision, product, and the future of deeFind.  And our future is bright.  We need more companies who thrive on the morale of conservation and ethics, which is why this campaign is so critical; we really need to begin shifting the way we conduct business: unite, work together, build each other up.  We have the power to get there, but we do need investors like you in order to be successful. </span>

I will continue to self-fund my business on my own as long as I can sustain, though it would be refreshing not to see the numbers in the red. The objective is to raise $10,000 towards my production run for my Spring/Summer 2012 collection.  This amount does not cover all my expenses but if we raised that amount, it would give me a bit of a buffer where I could put $8,000 towards my production costs and $2,000 towards important expenses such as photo shoots, a look book, public relations and marketing.  If I don't meet my goal I will still allocate 80% towards production and the other 20% to public relations and marketing.  To keep our deeFind 'Dream Team' vision alive, we are depending on you.</span></p>

We are not letting this stand in our way. We will continue to advance forward in the direction of deeFind's destination and our IndieGoGo campaign—with you all right behind us. What this will mean are a few things. 1) For the most part, the perks will stay the same. Some contributors may see a slight difference in the merchandise they will receive, 2) the Spring/Summer 2012 collection is now cataloged as a Spring/Summer concept shoe, one that will not be launched as a full line, rather available by appointment only sessions, private parties and small wholesale events, and 3) our original description on our IndieGoGo page indicated that the funds raised would be allocated to the manufacturing and marketing &amp; promotions budget, though now, those funds raised will be distributed to the next line of deeFind projects for the remainder of 2012 and Spring/Summer 2013. <br/><br/>We are immensely grateful to everyone for their staunch support and love throughout this time and hope that you continue to contribute as much as you can.

<span class=""notranlsate""><p>We are PUSHunderground and we decided to do things a different way. <b>A totally different way.</b> Let's start from the beginning. </p>
<p>Did you know that Americans use <b>2.5 million plastic bottles every hour?</b> And recycle about <b>9%</b> of it? Most of it goes straight to the landfill and do you know what happens once it gets to the landfill? <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/107014/files/20131001134021-2ad267fd5417d79d4f79a297687cfff6_large.jpg?1380660021"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>Nothing.</b> It just sits there. So... we asked ourselves if there was anyway that we could make the very best sportswear out of plastic water bottles. And we found out that yes, not only can we make clothing out of recycle plastic bottles,<b> but we can make it better. </b><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/107019/files/20131001134331-4fd3d10b429989baec5a67cbb79d2cd3_large.jpg?1380660211"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p></span><h3><b>Superior Product</b></h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""><p></p></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><p>We've watched hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours of workouts. We have asked countless athletes to tell us the best and worst thing about what they trained in. <br/></p>
<p>They've described for us exactly where they needed the clothes to move and where they needed them to stay put. <b>And we made what the athletes wanted.</b></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Putting Americans Back To Work</h3>
<p>We make our clothing right here in America, at a family-run factory close to home. <b>PUSHunderground wants to help put Americans back to work.</b> And beyond that, our factory is local, so our carbon footprint is light. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Together We Can Make a Difference</h3>
<p><b>But that is not all we wanted to do.</b> Where could we and our customers make the biggest difference?</p>
<p><b>Water</b>... we could take on the crisis of clean, safe water. <b>Did you know in water scarce communities girls as young as 8 will spend up to 5 hours a day collecting water?</b> They will spend their lifetime collecting water? Instead of going to school? Or starting a business?<br/></p>

<p>The
Velocity Vroom was designed with the female athlete in mind. You don't want to
babysit your shorts when you're supposed to be working out. <b>All that yanking and pulling, rearranging,
making sure you've got your assets covered, who wants that? </b></p>
<p>That's
why we built in sexy bloomers to make flashing in the gym a thing of the past.
And the flattering <b>cut will look amazing
on any woman</b> while allowing a full range of motion during your entire
workout: from squats to pull ups to everything else you do. </p>
<p>The
V V shorts are made from moisture-wicking nylon and Eco-friendly recycled water
bottle material, so they're super comfortable and you can feel great about
wearing them! And did we tell you they're really sexy? <b>Ya...they're really sexy. </b></p>
<p><b>Colors Options</b>: Grey with Black
Waistband (Pink Logo), Red with Black Waistband (Black Logo), and Solid Black
(Grey Logo)</p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Our Story...PUSH Hard, Tread Light
We are PUSHunderground and we decided to do things a different way. A totally different way. Let's start from the beginning. 
Did you know that Americans use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour? And recycle about 9% of it? Most of it goes straight to the landfill and do you know what happens once it gets to the landfill? 



Nothing. It just sits there. So... we asked ourselves if there was anyway that we could make the very best sportswear out of plastic water bottles. And we found out that yes, not only can we make clothing out of recycle plastic bottles, but we can make it better. 


Superior Product
We've watched hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours of workouts. We have asked countless athletes to tell us the best and worst thing about what they trained in. 
They've described for us exactly where they needed the clothes to move and where they needed them to stay put. And we made what the athletes wanted.



Putting Americans Back To Work
We make our clothing right here in America, at a family-run factory close to home. PUSHunderground wants to help put Americans back to work. And beyond that, our factory is local, so our carbon footprint is light. 



Together We Can Make a Difference
But that is not all we wanted to do. Where could we and our customers make the biggest difference?
Water... we could take on the crisis of clean, safe water. Did you know in water scarce communities girls as young as 8 will spend up to 5 hours a day collecting water? They will spend their lifetime collecting water? Instead of going to school? Or starting a business?

At PUSHunderground for every purchase you make, we will donate a portion of the proceeds to building wells in water scarce communities around the world. Together we can make a difference. 
The Rewards
Hybrid Hipster

 
The Hybrid Hipster is a lightweight,
durable short that allows athletes the ultimate mobility while allowing for a
full range of motion. These shorts are cut right above the knee and include
an extra panel of 4-way stretch fabric (poly spandex blend) and Eco-friendly
recycled water bottle material on the inside to add mobility without ever
getting in the way. So whether you're squatting, dead lifting, running or doing yoga, the Hybrid Hipster gives you exactly what you need all while looking rad.
Color Options: Black with Grey Logo

Velocity Vroom



Grey, Red, Black

The
Velocity Vroom was designed with the female athlete in mind. You don't want to
babysit your shorts when you're supposed to be working out. All that yanking and pulling, rearranging,
making sure you've got your assets covered, who wants that? 
That's
why we built in sexy bloomers to make flashing in the gym a thing of the past.
And the flattering cut will look amazing
on any woman while allowing a full range of motion during your entire
workout: from squats to pull ups to everything else you do. 
The
V V shorts are made from moisture-wicking nylon and Eco-friendly recycled water
bottle material, so they're super comfortable and you can feel great about
wearing them! And did we tell you they're really sexy? Ya...they're really sexy. 
Colors Options: Grey with Black
Waistband (Pink Logo), Red with Black Waistband (Black Logo), and Solid Black
(Grey Logo)

Superpower Cinching




Olive, Black, Periwinkle 

Have
no fear, superpower cinching is here. These
shorts were designed with you in mind because you get to loosen or tighten
with the pull of a string. On the days when you may need a little extra room in
the waist just loosen the string and KAPOW,
your shorts are perfect! 
And
wearing them lets you max out your workout while you support the environment,
because they’re made from recycled polyester so you can really feel like a
superhero. (Cape not included).

you handle your cutting edge workout. The four-way stretch material allows for
maximum mobility with no chafing. 
They are so comfortable you forget you are

been in the center of worldwide interest during the last few months. A lot of the publicity
is negative portraying Greeks as being lazy. An image of young Greeks
doing nothing and asking for a bailout is promoted throughout some of the
international press.
Urban Owl aims to present the other side of the
story, that of young entrepreneurs striving to make a difference. Held down by
the economic crisis seeking for alternative ways to evolve. With ambitious projects, innovative ideas and hard work.
This campaign is all about that. Manufacturing handcrafted sunglasses exclusively in Greece
using materials of the highest standards with exceptional quality and craftsmanship, combined with a unique lens providing an experience like no other.
Urban Owl sunglasses's
lens is one of a kind the combination of its special tint with the blue light
control filters has a profound effect on the image quality. The difference compared
to mainstream lenses is immediately noticed. 
By
supporting us you get the best pair of sunglasses you will ever wear and at the same time you become a part of our effort to uphold the productive
side of Greece, in the most direct way. 
Urban represents the modern way of
living. Owl in ancient Greece accompanies ancient goddess Athena and has been
used as a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, perspicacity and erudition.
The combination of the two, Urban Owl,
suggests values and symbols that transcend time and today are even more
important in the era of digital information.

The negative effects of blue light have been
scientifically proven.
How to Protect Your Eyes From the Negative Effects of
Digital Devices and Blue Light


Urban Owl sunglasses follow the latest standards
of ISO 12312-1:2013 and are FDA approved and CE certified.






















A big part of this project is focused in
solidarity for the people in need. That is why I have reached out to a credible
non-profit organization in Greece, in order to ensure the transparency
of all transactions.
For every pair of Urban Owl sunglasses
sold in this campaign we will give 5€ to charity and we are providing the
Golden and Platinum packs that contribute 1.000€ and 3.000€ respectively. 
At the end of the campaign, all the
money collected for charity, will be given directly to the non-profit
organization. 
In case we reach 1 million and for every
other million, we will choose an additional non-profit organization to support
in Greece.




We need your support to start production. By
supporting us:


Your gesture of solidarity will be
captured in a small iconic blue patch embodied in every pair of sunglasses.
You will be able to choose from 4
initially available models. After you have selected your reward you will be
asked to make your choice of exact model after the campaign concludes. More
choices will be available during the campaign, as more models will be added as stretch
goals.

<h3>MugCrate is a quarterly subscription box for lovers of Tiki mugs and all things Polynesian-pop! Just Subscribe, Unbox, &amp; Enjoy!</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>MugCrate is borne of a sincere
     desire to expose Tiki fans new and old to the best the Tiki movement has
     to offer (and a desire to make gift giving a little more enjoyable for
     people not in the know!)</li>
<li>So far in the evolution of this
     project, we've built a screen printing rig and learned to print boxes,
     priced out a year's worth of boxes, run a ""MugCrate test""
     through our site(horrorinclay.com), and contacted many artisans and
     events. All we need now is subscribers!</li>
<li>As a gift to our subscribers, we
     plan to randomly select one Starter MugCrate to upgrade to a Deluxe
     MugCrate for every 100 MugCrates sold per quarter.  If we exceed our
     funding goal in this campaign, the numbers of upgrades will increase as
     well as we will be upgrading some Deluxe crates to ultracrate status.</li>
<li>We feel we can do this with a
     high degree of reliability and quality because my husband and I have run a
     Tiki Mug company (<a href=""http://www.horrorinclay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>horrorinclay.com</span></a>)
     for the past 5 years, and have experience shipping Tiki mugs, fulfilling 3
     successful Kickstarters, and managing product launches, along with many
     contacts in the Tiki world...we can absolutely do this.</li>

<p><b>I hope to use this
platform to create curated boxes suitable for treating Tiki collectors to a fun
experience every quarter. I hope to expose Tiki collectors new and
old to lesser known events, artists, and goods they've never seen that they will
enjoy. </b></p>
<p>MugCrate is currently
preparing for launch and raising funds through Indiegogo to help speed the
process. Because we work with independent creators as well as established
companies, the margins are slim, which means it is essential that we purchase
in as large a quantity as possible in order to keep our costs low. These funds
will allow us to buy our advance inventory in larger batches and help us keep
MugCrate accessible to as many subscribers as possible.  </p>
<p><b>The more funds we raise,
the better your boxes! We've already plotted the costs of our first year of
operation — if we exceed our goals, we'll use those funds to make your MugCrate
even more shiny! </b> Our budget will be based on funds that we have already
spent to start acquiring goods and production setup, funds we raise through
this campaign, and sales of future quarter MugCrates after the campaign ends.</p>

This box was created out of necessity. My husband is a tikiphile and is always
looking for the next shiny thing for his collection. Because he LOOOVES all
things Tiki, his collection is constantly growing and changing and he can be
hard to buy for. (It's easy to get something that feels tiki to me, but a
little more difficult to find just the the right thing he'll love). </p>
<p>To help, I have a
database of wish lists and coveted items; a list I plan to use to use as a
starting point to curate a special quarterly giftbox for you or your tikiphile.</p>
<p>The more funds we raise,
the better your boxes! We've already plotted the costs of our first year of
operation — if we exceed our goals, we'll use those funds to make your MugCrate
even more shiny!</p>
<p><b>My husband wants you to know...</b></p>
<p>He's a ""Big tent"" Tiki mug collector, so some of the
things I'll include in the MugCrates are not just Tiki totem mugs...floats,
pufferfish, monsters, etc could all be represented...but they'll be good ones,
and from people and manufacturers you know (or want to know!), mostly.<br/>

<p>Be careful what you buy
in a thrift store for 10 cents. About 10 years ago, I purchased a tiki mug for
my boyfriend at the time for 10 cents. This started his quest and obsession to
possess more Tiki mugs and other collectibles. From that one mug, he has built
up a collection of hundreds of unique Tiki mugs from around the world. As well
as, many art pieces, recipe books, syrups, bitters, bar tools, coasters,
swizzles, matchbooks, and the list goes on. If it is a unique piece of Tiki or
Polynesian-pop, then he wants to have it in his collection.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span><i></i></span></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463022357/startofitall_sm_knzzar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><i>The mug that started it all. $0.10 at a prop warehouse.</i><p></p>
<p>Over the last five years,
he has started his own Tiki mug company specializing in literary horror Tiki
mugs - Horror In Clay. We started this company together over his want to own
one Cthulhu mug and now we have shipped over 1,000 around the world. (He is the
designer. I am the logistics and numbers person.) During this 5 year roller
coaster ride, I have learned fascinating things about ceramics, Tiki art, and
of course the best ways to drink rum. I continue this learning adventure
everyday.</p>
<p>The more we venture down
the rum hole the more we find out about new small artisans, educational groups,
events, and tiki bars. So a couple of years ago I started a wish list that I
add to all the time of things as well as places and events I want to and more
importantly my husband wants to attend. I plan to use this list as a starting
point for the first year of MugCrate as I continue to find more awesome things
for the collection. I hope to take this passion and bring it to you or your
favorite Tikiphile. And of course getting a present in the mail once a quarter
that you can only imagine what might be inside is fun as well.</p>
<p>I want to thank my
daughter for being ok with the possibility of even more boxes of Tiki stuff in
our house. And of my husband for his encouragement of me moving forward with
this idea. Of course, I think he will love being my continued source of inspiration
for new gifts for him and the MugCrate recipients.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463022409/us_sm_yguf3u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

<p>I am in a great position
as far as having the knowledge and background to make this kind of project
easier. I have been working with my husband (we run Horror In Clay) to pack and
ship mugs around the world for the last 5 years. We have learned the ins and
outs of packaging ceramics and shipping them out.</p>
<p>MugCrate does have the
unique challenge of shipping everything at once instead of one order at a time,
but after doing the logistics part of multiple Kickstarters for Horror In Clay
and others, I have some tricks and systems in place to help handle that as
well. Also, I just helped run a Mutant Mystery Box fulfillment for Horror In
Clay to test out the best way to pack and ship this type of item.</p>
<p>I believe the biggest challenge for me will be making sure to
balance the number of MugCrates sold with the number of items the artisans have
on hand to sell. We are talking to artisans all over the world that are used to
selling one at a time or a few at most, so we will be working ahead to make
sure to balance the time lines for the artist to bring you interesting, unique,
and ""must have"" things for your collection.</p>
<p></p></div>","MugCrate is a quarterly subscription box for lovers of Tiki mugs and all things Polynesian-pop! Just Subscribe, Unbox, & Enjoy!


MugCrate is borne of a sincere
     desire to expose Tiki fans new and old to the best the Tiki movement has
     to offer (and a desire to make gift giving a little more enjoyable for
     people not in the know!)
So far in the evolution of this
     project, we've built a screen printing rig and learned to print boxes,
     priced out a year's worth of boxes, run a ""MugCrate test""
     through our site(horrorinclay.com), and contacted many artisans and
     events. All we need now is subscribers!
As a gift to our subscribers, we
     plan to randomly select one Starter MugCrate to upgrade to a Deluxe
     MugCrate for every 100 MugCrates sold per quarter.  If we exceed our
     funding goal in this campaign, the numbers of upgrades will increase as
     well as we will be upgrading some Deluxe crates to ultracrate status.
We feel we can do this with a
     high degree of reliability and quality because my husband and I have run a
     Tiki Mug company (horrorinclay.com)
     for the past 5 years, and have experience shipping Tiki mugs, fulfilling 3
     successful Kickstarters, and managing product launches, along with many
     contacts in the Tiki world...we can absolutely do this.
  Pledge now! (then come back and read the rest!)

Types of things that might show up in a MugCrate.

I hope to use this
platform to create curated boxes suitable for treating Tiki collectors to a fun
experience every quarter. I hope to expose Tiki collectors new and
old to lesser known events, artists, and goods they've never seen that they will
enjoy. 
MugCrate is currently
preparing for launch and raising funds through Indiegogo to help speed the
process. Because we work with independent creators as well as established
companies, the margins are slim, which means it is essential that we purchase
in as large a quantity as possible in order to keep our costs low. These funds
will allow us to buy our advance inventory in larger batches and help us keep
MugCrate accessible to as many subscribers as possible.  
The more funds we raise,
the better your boxes! We've already plotted the costs of our first year of
operation — if we exceed our goals, we'll use those funds to make your MugCrate
even more shiny!  Our budget will be based on funds that we have already
spent to start acquiring goods and production setup, funds we raise through
this campaign, and sales of future quarter MugCrates after the campaign ends.
The whole year you say? What'cha thinking?

What will be in a box?
Each quarter, we will
send you a box containing a quality tiki mug and other surprises for your home
tiki bar or next luau.  Some of these surprise items might include
- art pieces, recipe books, syrups, bitters, bar tools, coasters,
swizzles, matchbooks, and the list goes on and on.
Every MugCrate will contain a Tiki mug. It will include a few of
these types of things as well.
We have been talking to
Tiki artisans around the world to find great additions to any collection, as
well as other items to use in the bar, on the walls, and even in the mugs. We
pack these carefully chosen tiki mugs with an assortment of unique tiki
ephemera and goods.
Each quarter the box will
have a theme that wraps the mug, companion items, and drink recipe together.
Also, in the box we will work to include information on tiki events (big and
small!) going on around the world to keep you up to date with the larger tiki
movement.

Photo shows types of things
you'd find in a MugCrate
What's the diff between a standard box and a
Deluxe box?
The standard box has at
least a mug, a big neat thing, and a bunch of little neat things.  The
Deluxe box is better....it might be the same mug, a variant of the mug, or an
upgrade of the same theme of mug.  Also, there will be 2 or more big neat
things, and a bunch of little neat things in the box.
All the boxes will be
hand screen-printed, packed with care, and delivered to the postman by me or my
husband.

Also, for some reason, my
husband loves Tiki Bob mugs. (I do not love them).  We figured other
people would like to declare their allegiance to Team Bob or Team No Bob as
well, so we did Bob themed postcards

Stretch Goal For every $5,000 we
exceed our goal, we will increase the odds of standard MugCrates turning into
Deluxe MugCrates.  We already plan to randomly select one Starter MugCrate
to a Deluxe MugCrate and one Deluxe MugCrate to a Ultra Crate of more awesome
things for every  1/100 MugCrates sold per quarter.

Me (Allison) and a (small) part of our Tiki collection
Tell me about your motivation.
This box was created out of necessity. My husband is a tikiphile and is always
looking for the next shiny thing for his collection. Because he LOOOVES all
things Tiki, his collection is constantly growing and changing and he can be
hard to buy for. (It's easy to get something that feels tiki to me, but a
little more difficult to find just the the right thing he'll love). 
To help, I have a
database of wish lists and coveted items; a list I plan to use to use as a
starting point to curate a special quarterly giftbox for you or your tikiphile.
The more funds we raise,
the better your boxes! We've already plotted the costs of our first year of
operation — if we exceed our goals, we'll use those funds to make your MugCrate
even more shiny!
My husband wants you to know...
He's a ""Big tent"" Tiki mug collector, so some of the
things I'll include in the MugCrates are not just Tiki totem mugs...floats,
pufferfish, monsters, etc could all be represented...but they'll be good ones,
and from people and manufacturers you know (or want to know!), mostly.


Community involvement!

A little bit about myself or how a dime can
change your life...
Be careful what you buy
in a thrift store for 10 cents. About 10 years ago, I purchased a tiki mug for
my boyfriend at the time for 10 cents. This started his quest and obsession to
possess more Tiki mugs and other collectibles. From that one mug, he has built
up a collection of hundreds of unique Tiki mugs from around the world. As well
as, many art pieces, recipe books, syrups, bitters, bar tools, coasters,
swizzles, matchbooks, and the list goes on. If it is a unique piece of Tiki or
Polynesian-pop, then he wants to have it in his collection.  
The mug that started it all. $0.10 at a prop warehouse.
Over the last five years,
he has started his own Tiki mug company specializing in literary horror Tiki
mugs - Horror In Clay. We started this company together over his want to own
one Cthulhu mug and now we have shipped over 1,000 around the world. (He is the
designer. I am the logistics and numbers person.) During this 5 year roller
coaster ride, I have learned fascinating things about ceramics, Tiki art, and
of course the best ways to drink rum. I continue this learning adventure
everyday.
The more we venture down
the rum hole the more we find out about new small artisans, educational groups,
events, and tiki bars. So a couple of years ago I started a wish list that I
add to all the time of things as well as places and events I want to and more
importantly my husband wants to attend. I plan to use this list as a starting
point for the first year of MugCrate as I continue to find more awesome things
for the collection. I hope to take this passion and bring it to you or your
favorite Tikiphile. And of course getting a present in the mail once a quarter
that you can only imagine what might be inside is fun as well.
I want to thank my
daughter for being ok with the possibility of even more boxes of Tiki stuff in
our house. And of my husband for his encouragement of me moving forward with
this idea. Of course, I think he will love being my continued source of inspiration
for new gifts for him and the MugCrate recipients.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How do TouchPoints™ work?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Let's break this down into three steps:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reduce Body Sensations: </strong>When you think of something stressful, you get an associated body sensation - think stomach butterflies or tightness in the chest. Touchpoints™ users report over 70% reduction in body sensations within 30 seconds by altering the body’s stress mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shift Fight or Flight Response: </strong>When you're stressed, the fight or flight part of your brain (sympathetic nervous system) engages. TouchPoints™ shifts you into the logical, rational part of your brain (parasympathetic nervous system). Now when you think about something stressful, it doesn't seem as stressful anymore.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create New Neural Pathways: </strong>When you think of something stressful without a body sensation and while in the rational part of your brain, you create a new neural pathway that is neutral to positive. This has a lasting effect in your brain reducing stress over time and is why TouchPoints™ were derived from one of the only successful treatments for PTSD.</p></li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h3>
<p>On a hot Arizona morning in late 2015, Vicki Mayo confided in her close friend about a serious parenting challenge. Vicki’s young daughter had been experiencing night terrors, and Vicki, who had tried everything, was at her breaking point – she didn’t know what else she could do to help her six-year-old, whose nighttime screams were stressful not only to the child, but to the entire family.</p>
<p>Luckily, her close friend was Dr. Amy Serin, a top neuropsychologist specializing in research and clinical treatment of anxiety that hampers  relaxation, sleep, and ability to cope with sensory stimuli. Dr. Serin had used BLAST technology with her patients, her children and herself and suggested Vicki try the non-invasive, gentle set of alternating vibrations designed to alter the body’s F3 response to stress and anxiety and to restore homeostatic nervous system functioning.</p>
<p>Vicki tried the technology with her daughter that night, and was floored by the results. The technology  worked, and her daughter slept peacefully for the first time in months.</p>
<p>Vicki, a serial entrepreneur and child advocate, called Dr. Serin, who had also been thinking about how to get this technology into more people’s hands to improve their lives. Together, they founded The Touchpoint Solution™  and launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in December 2016 to raise funds to create a consumer-friendly product bringing BLAST technology to market.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>How does TouchPoints™ basic help reduce my stress?</strong></p>
<p>TouchPoints™ use BLAST technology that gently interferes with the body's stress response and produces a more calm, focused state. Thousands of users report they feel more calm, can focus, are able to sleep better, and perform better with use. TouchPoints™ can be used for a short duration to spot-treat stress, or they may be left on for longer periods of time to prevent it, as well as 15 minutes in the morning and at night to help improve sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a refund policy?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We want you to be 100% satisfied with your TouchPoints™. If for some reason you want to return them, we offer a 30 risk free trial from the date of arrival, provided TouchPoints™ are returned in their original condition. </p>
</div><div>
<p><b>Who Should Use </b><strong>TouchPoints™?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who would like to feel calm or help calm down their friends, family members, or co-workers.  Moms, executives, performers, athletes, kids, teachers, occupational therapists, psychologists, medical doctors, and first responders are some of the early adopters who now use TouchPoints™ on a regular basis in a variety of situations. Parents especially find TouchPoints™ effective for managing their children's ADHD and anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>What's the Difference Between TouchPoints™ basic and TouchPoints™ original?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507654425/fsenjn3zx5cd7ieoyojb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Are TouchPoints™ and Buzzies the same thing? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. When we originally launched in December 2016 TouchPoints™ were called Buzzies. We listened to customers' concerns that the name Buzzies implied loud devices that might shock the body or were only for children. To alleviate confusion, we changed the name of our gentle, non-invasive stress-relieving devices to TouchPoints™.</p>
<p><strong>Is there research to back up TouchPoints™?</strong></p>
<p>The TouchPoint Solution™ recently analyzed statistics from thousands of TouchPoints™ users who voluntarily entered metrics into the product’s app. Learn more about the <a href=""https://buzzies.com/blogs/buzzies-blog/scientific-data-confirms-that-buzzies-reduce-stress-by-74-in-30-seconds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">research here</a>.</p>

<p>This is data from an electroencephalogram of a brain of a 38-year-old male CEO. The left image shows excess beta activity, which translates into heightened anxiety, stress, and restlessness. The right image shows beta activity after just one minute of using TouchPoints™ with BLAST technology.</p>
<p>The immediate reduction in excess beta activity was consistent with the CEO’s report that he felt more focused and able to problem-solve after TouchPoints™ were activated for 30 seconds. </p>
<p>Optimal beta activity is associated with focus, possible memory enhancement, and the ability to problem-solve without interference from anxiety.</p>

In honor of #GivingTuesday, we are highlighting our Scholarship program among our other initiatives that give back to the community.

Touch of Hope Scholarship. Every month, we donate dozens of TouchPoints™ to individuals in need via our Touch Of Hope Scholarship Fund. Individuals can apply by completing a simple form. To date we have given away hundreds of TouchPoints™ to deserving families. We recently dedicated our scholarship program to MacKenzie Briant, a young girl very near and dear to all of our hearts here at The TouchPoint Solution™. Watch her inspiring story below...

 

Packaging and Fulfillment by Individuals with disabilities. Each and every one of our products are packaged and fulfilled by individuals with epilepsy and other developmental disabilities.

Utilization of Local Companies for packaging, graphics, printing, and carry bags.

How do TouchPoints™ work?
Let's break this down into three steps:

Reduce Body Sensations: When you think of something stressful, you get an associated body sensation - think stomach butterflies or tightness in the chest. Touchpoints™ users report over 70% reduction in body sensations within 30 seconds by altering the body’s stress mechanism.
Shift Fight or Flight Response: When you're stressed, the fight or flight part of your brain (sympathetic nervous system) engages. TouchPoints™ shifts you into the logical, rational part of your brain (parasympathetic nervous system). Now when you think about something stressful, it doesn't seem as stressful anymore.
Create New Neural Pathways: When you think of something stressful without a body sensation and while in the rational part of your brain, you create a new neural pathway that is neutral to positive. This has a lasting effect in your brain reducing stress over time and is why TouchPoints™ were derived from one of the only successful treatments for PTSD.

Our Story
On a hot Arizona morning in late 2015, Vicki Mayo confided in her close friend about a serious parenting challenge. Vicki’s young daughter had been experiencing night terrors, and Vicki, who had tried everything, was at her breaking point – she didn’t know what else she could do to help her six-year-old, whose nighttime screams were stressful not only to the child, but to the entire family.
Luckily, her close friend was Dr. Amy Serin, a top neuropsychologist specializing in research and clinical treatment of anxiety that hampers  relaxation, sleep, and ability to cope with sensory stimuli. Dr. Serin had used BLAST technology with her patients, her children and herself and suggested Vicki try the non-invasive, gentle set of alternating vibrations designed to alter the body’s F3 response to stress and anxiety and to restore homeostatic nervous system functioning.
Vicki tried the technology with her daughter that night, and was floored by the results. The technology  worked, and her daughter slept peacefully for the first time in months.
Vicki, a serial entrepreneur and child advocate, called Dr. Serin, who had also been thinking about how to get this technology into more people’s hands to improve their lives. Together, they founded The Touchpoint Solution™  and launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in December 2016 to raise funds to create a consumer-friendly product bringing BLAST technology to market.

FAQs
How does TouchPoints™ basic help reduce my stress?
TouchPoints™ use BLAST technology that gently interferes with the body's stress response and produces a more calm, focused state. Thousands of users report they feel more calm, can focus, are able to sleep better, and perform better with use. TouchPoints™ can be used for a short duration to spot-treat stress, or they may be left on for longer periods of time to prevent it, as well as 15 minutes in the morning and at night to help improve sleep.
Is there a refund policy?
Yes! We want you to be 100% satisfied with your TouchPoints™. If for some reason you want to return them, we offer a 30 risk free trial from the date of arrival, provided TouchPoints™ are returned in their original condition. 

Who Should Use TouchPoints™?
Anyone who would like to feel calm or help calm down their friends, family members, or co-workers.  Moms, executives, performers, athletes, kids, teachers, occupational therapists, psychologists, medical doctors, and first responders are some of the early adopters who now use TouchPoints™ on a regular basis in a variety of situations. Parents especially find TouchPoints™ effective for managing their children's ADHD and anxiety.
What's the Difference Between TouchPoints™ basic and TouchPoints™ original?

Are TouchPoints™ and Buzzies the same thing? 
Yes. When we originally launched in December 2016 TouchPoints™ were called Buzzies. We listened to customers' concerns that the name Buzzies implied loud devices that might shock the body or were only for children. To alleviate confusion, we changed the name of our gentle, non-invasive stress-relieving devices to TouchPoints™.
Is there research to back up TouchPoints™?
The TouchPoint Solution™ recently analyzed statistics from thousands of TouchPoints™ users who voluntarily entered metrics into the product’s app. Learn more about the research here.
The Proof Is In The Picture.

This is data from an electroencephalogram of a brain of a 38-year-old male CEO. The left image shows excess beta activity, which translates into heightened anxiety, stress, and restlessness. The right image shows beta activity after just one minute of using TouchPoints™ with BLAST technology.
The immediate reduction in excess beta activity was consistent with the CEO’s report that he felt more focused and able to problem-solve after TouchPoints™ were activated for 30 seconds. 
Optimal beta activity is associated with focus, possible memory enhancement, and the ability to problem-solve without interference from anxiety.
Images are qEEG results using a Cognionics Quick-20 Dry Headset, Neuroguide version 2.8.7, and LFT Tools Software for analysis. They show a significant reduction in excess beta activity 30 seconds after BLAST application in an eyes-open resting state condition was administered. (z = 2.5, z = 2.0)",7.0,2,"3 Campaigns
