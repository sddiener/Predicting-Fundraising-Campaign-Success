<h3>My Story (brief)</h3>
<p>Since becoming a follower of Yeshua/Jesus back in 2004, I've dedicated my songwriting and guitar playing to Him and His Glory. Through the years I've written and recorded over 200 demos and I've posted a few on my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/wordofourtestimony"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">youtube channel</a>, which has over 2000+ subscribers and over 1,000,000 views! My desire is to continue to release these demos and any new songs as high quality recordings and make them available for download or release them as videos. With a new high powered computer and recording equipment I will be able to continue to release new content that will strengthen and edify the body of Yeshua. So please contribute, share, comment and pray that this project will be used for the glory of God and King Yeshua!</p>

<h3>Why Crowd Funding?</h3>
<p>I haven't released a new video or song since 2014. A big part of that is being married and having kids, working and just not having a lot of extra time to devote to projects. Another reason is I don't feel I have the tools to produce quality songs or videos that can meet the standard of quality that is out there today. With a new workstation and recording equipment I will be releasing songs and videos I've wanted to share for a long time but just haven't had the means to do so.</p>
<p>For example, one of my songs, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9z4T_xsAq8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Lamb That Was Slain</a>"" was written after hearing the inspiring story of the two brave Moravian missionaries who sold themselves into slavery just to spread the Gospel of Jesus to an isolated island. I would love to re-record this song with drums, guitars and great backing vocals and put it to a video that shows the story of the two Moravians. This is just one of many projects that I'd love to complete someday.</p>

<h3>Who is WOOT?</h3>
<p>The Word of Our Testimony is a collective of artists who desire to see Yeshua exalted through song and video. At the core of WOOT would be myself, Scott Ogden. After becoming a follower of Yeshua/Jesus I began writing songs that would glorify Him and have continued to do so for 13 years. I posted my first video on Youtube in 2009 and have posted 61 videos since. Mostly lyric videos, the Messianic Hebrew Worship videos have received the most views with the video, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEX83Irhag4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shir Ahava</a>"" reaching 600,000+ views. Occasionally I will post a video of me or someone I know performing an original composition. I've enjoyed sharing the Hebrew worship songs I learned while in Israel, as the language itself is so beautiful and I pray many Israelis come to know Yeshua by possibly stumbling onto one of these videos.</p>
<p>Our core values could be summed up in 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exalting Yeshua/Jesus through song and video.</li>
<li>Encouraging Believers in Yeshua to Worship Him.</li>
<li>Encouraging Non-Believers to believe in Yeshua and Worship Him.</li>
</ul>

<h3>GREETING EARTHLINGS</h3>
<p>I'm Tom Larsen, a singer-songwriter, musician, producer with a new band The Vistanauts (me, Stephanie Selcho, Kent Rytting, Anton Nielsen, Jerod Stutsman) ready to record a debut lp of all new, all original songs.   </p>
<h3>IN THE BEGINNING</h3>
<p>I started writing songs at 7 (I remember the first, heh: ""It's God's Fault"") and started home recording them in various contexts beginning at 13 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485236417/jsrb3ifpi1fesd7jwarj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>and on through the years, playing keyboards, then guitar, then singing (see above--me with ""Steve-O"" of ""SLC Punk"" movie) in bands I formed or joined, composed for film and video and eventually went solo at 22.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485236553/ql5rohvn0qiikqwc3mus.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At 24 I was offered a recording contract from a top UK label, while in talks with legendary producer Ken Scott (Bowie, Beatles, Supertramp, Lou Reed)--but had to walk away from it all.  I had 3 young sons at the time--2 with special needs and realized my young family that needed my full attention (I had vowed early on that I would not allow my personal ""dream"" to supersede the needs of my family commitments.)  </p>
<p>It crushed me inside--to put that creative drive/compulsion on hold--but I've never doubted it was the right thing to do. And I did still manage to continue writing songs and find ways to record them throughout the intervening years, occasionally performing when opportunities arose.</p>
<p>On a lark of sorts, I applied and got accepted into law school, graduating in the early 2000s.  But it was not my cup of tea (okay, I hated it) and so I went back to my ""day job""--housepainting, where I was mostly left alone to continue creating . . . in my mind at the very least, when unable to record or perform my latest new song.</p>
<h3>INFLUENCES AND HISTORY</h3>
<p> But rewind a bit: I was turned on to Bowie around age 12, in '74, relating instantly to his ""strangeness"", his ""otherness"".  I myself always felt and usually was the outsider.  Neither right nor left . . . and definitely not center; burying myself in anything creative, especially music, writing and art.  Bowie became my main muse--my ""mainman"", but I also explored all kinds of music, such as Stevie Wonder, Frank Zappa, Todd Rundgren, ENO, Yes, ELP, Kansas, CSN&amp;Y,  Sinatra, Stones, Sly . . . Waylon &amp; Willie, Bacharach and  Prince, to name but a few.</p>
<p>But it was Bowie who predominated my musical studies overall, and so, when, on the day after he died in 2016, my youngest son (also a musician) called me to ask if I'd join his band in a tribute that night singing ""Heroes"".  I, of course, happily accepted and it turned out to be an impactful performance for all--not many dry eyes that night at the packed venue.</p>
<p>I had already been pondering putting together a ""Bowie"" cover band and/or a new originals' band--my boys now having grown up--and with my wife, decided ""why not?"", and ""let's just go for it.""</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/up59T2JMR1s?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>And so I did, first forming Major Tom &amp; The Moonboys--a  fantastic band dedicated to the music of David Bowie . . . and then--with the creative fires now reignited, I found myself writing all new material; and so formed this ""original's band"", The Vistanauts.</p>
<h3>WHERE IT ALL STANDS</h3>
<p>It's not been easy, but it has been fun and exhilarating to be writing, performing and now soon to be recording once more.  My 2 sons (of 4) with the special needs--while indeed are ""grown up""--still live at home and yet need help and resources . . . hence my request for help here to make this--at long last--debut album.  They are 100% supportive and excited for this venture which has brought new excitement and hope to the whole household.</p>

</div></div>","GREETING EARTHLINGS
I'm Tom Larsen, a singer-songwriter, musician, producer with a new band The Vistanauts (me, Stephanie Selcho, Kent Rytting, Anton Nielsen, Jerod Stutsman) ready to record a debut lp of all new, all original songs.   
IN THE BEGINNING
I started writing songs at 7 (I remember the first, heh: ""It's God's Fault"") and started home recording them in various contexts beginning at 13 
and on through the years, playing keyboards, then guitar, then singing (see above--me with ""Steve-O"" of ""SLC Punk"" movie) in bands I formed or joined, composed for film and video and eventually went solo at 22.   

At 24 I was offered a recording contract from a top UK label, while in talks with legendary producer Ken Scott (Bowie, Beatles, Supertramp, Lou Reed)--but had to walk away from it all.  I had 3 young sons at the time--2 with special needs and realized my young family that needed my full attention (I had vowed early on that I would not allow my personal ""dream"" to supersede the needs of my family commitments.)  
It crushed me inside--to put that creative drive/compulsion on hold--but I've never doubted it was the right thing to do. And I did still manage to continue writing songs and find ways to record them throughout the intervening years, occasionally performing when opportunities arose.
On a lark of sorts, I applied and got accepted into law school, graduating in the early 2000s.  But it was not my cup of tea (okay, I hated it) and so I went back to my ""day job""--housepainting, where I was mostly left alone to continue creating . . . in my mind at the very least, when unable to record or perform my latest new song.
INFLUENCES AND HISTORY
 But rewind a bit: I was turned on to Bowie around age 12, in '74, relating instantly to his ""strangeness"", his ""otherness"".  I myself always felt and usually was the outsider.  Neither right nor left . . . and definitely not center; burying myself in anything creative, especially music, writing and art.  Bowie became my main muse--my ""mainman"", but I also explored all kinds of music, such as Stevie Wonder, Frank Zappa, Todd Rundgren, ENO, Yes, ELP, Kansas, CSN&Y,  Sinatra, Stones, Sly . . . Waylon & Willie, Bacharach and  Prince, to name but a few.
But it was Bowie who predominated my musical studies overall, and so, when, on the day after he died in 2016, my youngest son (also a musician) called me to ask if I'd join his band in a tribute that night singing ""Heroes"".  I, of course, happily accepted and it turned out to be an impactful performance for all--not many dry eyes that night at the packed venue.
I had already been pondering putting together a ""Bowie"" cover band and/or a new originals' band--my boys now having grown up--and with my wife, decided ""why not?"", and ""let's just go for it.""

And so I did, first forming Major Tom & The Moonboys--a  fantastic band dedicated to the music of David Bowie . . . and then--with the creative fires now reignited, I found myself writing all new material; and so formed this ""original's band"", The Vistanauts.
WHERE IT ALL STANDS
It's not been easy, but it has been fun and exhilarating to be writing, performing and now soon to be recording once more.  My 2 sons (of 4) with the special needs--while indeed are ""grown up""--still live at home and yet need help and resources . . . hence my request for help here to make this--at long last--debut album.  They are 100% supportive and excited for this venture which has brought new excitement and hope to the whole household.
WHERE THE MONEY GOES
Age has its perks (combined with pent-up creative energy) and because of this I will be able to record a full-length album of the highest quality, all new songs, complete with a string section and choir (where needed:) for $9,000.00,   This will also include a commissioned custom art piece for the album cover rendered by renowned local artist Cody Chamberlain

This budget will also go towards a run of cd's and a batch of Ltd. Edition vinyl versions of the Lp (I'm still hopelessly old-school in many ways), and include the usual costs of musicians, mixing and mastering and costs associated with related publishing and promotion, plus Tee-Shirts, posters and hats.  
THE PAYOFF

<h2>""GERSHWIN FOR MY SOUL"" LP</h2>
<p>Few are called and fewer still are able to keenly rekindle the starlight from golden eras gone by. While said eras harbor timeless treasure chests of standards, those songs are often performed as museum pieces by well-meaning torchbearers instead of moving, living things with miles to go before they sleep. Singer/dancer/actor <strong>Elijah Rock</strong> has the triple threat skills and blood-pumping heart to breathe life into classic music as he proved on stage as ‘Crooner’ in the musical “Words By Ira Gershwin.” Now he has taken that more traditionalist template and, along with producer/arranger/pianist <strong>Kevin Toney</strong>, prepared a contemporary and decidedly African American twist to the music of<strong> George &amp; Ira Gershwin</strong> (and a couple of Ira’s other collaborators) with the innovative recording <strong><i>Gershwin For My Soul.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gershwin For My Soul </strong>represents a full circle journey for Cleveland-born baritone Elijah Rock. He began singing at age 13 and stepped up to his first Gershwin songs at 16 in “Porgy &amp; Bess” at the Cleveland Institute of Music. No less than the great Freddy Cole once told him, “Learn a standard a day and you’ll be alright!” Along with the Great American Songbook, show tunes, art songs and other classics that colored him Broadway-bound, Elijah always returned to Gershwin. It was while doing “Words By Ira Gershwin” that he learned how brothers George &amp; Ira were godfather geniuses of Tin Pan Alley in the early 20th century. Reading Michael Feinstein’s book “The Gershwins and Me” sealed the deal.</p>
<p>Carrying this art forward, <strong>Elijah Rock</strong> dove into this project with relish and the trio of producer/arranger/pianist <strong>Kevin Toney</strong>, bassist <strong>John B. Williams </strong>and drummer <strong>Greg Paul</strong>, plus guitarist <strong>Jacques Lesure </strong>in the west coast jazz sanctuary of <strong>Nolan Shaheed’s</strong> studio. The 12-song CD opens with “S’Wonderful,” a tender fitting contemporary take a la Al Jarreau. “Fascinating Rhythm” and “Our Love Is Here To Stay” are drenched in that punchy syncopated manner that most recalls their original era, the latter with some of Toney’s signature piano flourish. “I Can’t Get Started” swings and chugs with a four on the floor groove while the lovely “Long Ago and Far Away” floats on a slow hot wind bossa beat. Elijah milks the rarely heard extended introduction to “How Long Has This Been Goin’ On” before it falls like feathers into the brushed blues of its well known verses.</p>
<p>The second half of <i><strong>Gershwin For My Soul</strong></i> is where more chances are taken. The title track – the sole original penned by Rock and Toney – is a hip churchy blues where Elijah testifies his fascination with all things Gershwin. It’s followed boldly by “Tchaikovsky (And Other Russians),” a Hip Hop Swing interlude perfect post the Tonys-sweeping genre bending musical “Hamilton.” And Elijah brings his tap shoes in for solo and drum-dueling duties on the revival rave-up stomp “I Got Plenty O’ Nuttin’.” Most movingly, the focus becomes sheer aural nudity on a trio of ballads Elijah submerges into that showcase the full resonant beauty of his voice and his skills of interpretation from the acting world. They are the relaxed and romantic “Shall We Dance” (solely accompanied by the guitar of <strong>John Storie</strong>), the parlor song swoon of “Love Walked In” (featuring solo piano introduction and accompaniment by Toney), and the tour de force closer “Isn’t It a Pity,” a bluesy ballad wish of delicious diction and a heart-stopping dip into a cinematic so long.  </p>
<p>“Before this experience, I hadn’t really embraced the balladeer aspect of my gift,” Rock reflects. “It was about me being vulnerable enough to know I could do it. It’s been an interesting transformation…everything slowed down. There’s space for introspection and that moment to moment feeling of the lyric. I fell in love with the space between the notes and the simplicity of telling the story.”</p>
<p>Rock – whose resume boasts a decade and a half of acclaimed, across-the-board accomplishments in stage, film and television - found the perfect collaborator in Kevin Toney whose work as a keyboardist, composer, arranger, author, educator and co-founder of the `70s R&amp;B-Jazz group The Blackbyrds provided the optimal springboard for Rock to bounce concepts off. “<strong>Kevin Toney</strong> is a virtuoso whose experience speaks for itself,” Rock says. “We brought our authentic creative selves to the material and, in that, it became uniquely ours.” Targeting performance arts centers and playhouses as well as traditional music venues, Elijah will bring a unique live presentation of this music with theatrical, staging, choreography and lighting elements that position the show as more than a stand-up vocal concert yet not quite a full-on musical. Directed by<strong> Saundra McClain</strong> (who helmed his NAACP Award-winning performance in “Breath and Imagination: The Story of Roland Hayes”), Elijah’s vision simply must be experienced to be fully understood and deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Elijah Rock hopes to cultivate a younger audience for himself and this music with his all around showmanship, singing and paddle-n-roll style of tap dance - lost arts all that have found, in Rock, a tireless cultural savior. “I approach singing from a traditional perspective with a fresh twist,” Rock concludes. “Gershwin For My Soul not only represents America’s classical music, it gives me a platform to address other things about the culture and where we all stand today.”<br/>-A.

We greatly appreciate our fans, and have gone over and above in the past to provide exclusive merchandise and order packages.

This campaign goes beyond The Dark Rift to supporting PXR as a whole. We have many more releases from new artists coming soon!

If you were a fan of our first two albums, then you already know what we are capable of. If you're a new fan donate now and get digital or hard copies of the original releases with you're order!
Take a look at the original ""Empire of Fear"" campaign, will hardly any crowd funding the album was still released in full with amazing quality!
Contact VX or Mac the Rebel with any questions you may have about this crowd funding or PXR in general.


Unlike past PXR projects the Dark Rift is nearly complete!
With several singles out already, it is clear we are not starting this album from scratch. That being said, any funding received can help us gain back from distribution fees from the album.

PXR is a brand you can trust with over 7 studio mastered albums released already
With Studio engineers like Robert Pride & Mac the Rebel we use studio time very efficiently!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello music lovers! Welcome to my Indiegogo page!</p>
<p>My name is Emma Cava and I’ve been a professional musician since I immigrated to Toronto from the USA in 2010.  I'm raising funds so I can record and release what will be my debut recording: a collection of tunes inspired by living in Toronto as a 20-something woman, entitled <i>Young Lady</i>.</p>
<p>This 6-track EP will feature three of my original compositions, two modern jazz instrumentals with my own vocalese, and a swinging arrangement of a surprise pop cover.</p>
<p>I’ve known my purpose in life is to make music since I picked up the flute at 8 years old. The flute became a clarinet, then a a guitar. My parents were music lovers who always played Ella Fitzgerald and Blossom Dearie on the stereo. Eventually I started singing along. Within a few years I was taking singing lessons: first studying musical theatre, then opera, then classical art song. I found a home in church choirs and regional and state choir competitions.</p>
<p>I didn’t pursue jazz singing seriously until my mid-teens. My voice teachers turned me onto bebop vocalists like Sarah Vaughan, Sheila Jordan, Betty Carter, who inspire my singing and scatting to this day. During my undergrad at York University, I studied jazz voice in depth and explored my love of arranging and composing in and outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>Out of all the genres I work in as a musician, jazz remains my deepest love. I love how supported I feel when a great band is playing behind me. Scatting is my meditation. It's the one activity that centers me in the moment. I feel so focused, and so FREE! I feel that same freedom when I compose and write lyrics. Composing is the most honest way I know how to express myself. Jazz is a challenging language to learn, but a thrill to speak. Vocalese writers like Jon Hendricks, Mimi Perrin and Kurt Elling made jazz’s difficult vocabulary accessible for me as a young singer. When I write my own vocalese lyrics, I aim to do the same for the average listener. Sharing my music with the world allows me to be vulnerable and connect with others—all the while paying tribute to great artists in the jazz tradition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's a breakdown of all the expenses needed to make this EP happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recording $1800</p></li>
<li><p>Mixing $1800</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel $1000</p></li>
<li><p>Mastering $600</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Total funding needed: $7000</p>
<p>Recording will happen in early 2020. A CD release party will happen in the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>I am so grateful for any support you can give me. So grateful, that I'm calling my list of perks my Gratitude List. (Indiegogo won't let me change ""list of perks"" to ""Gratitude List"" (boo) but I'll roll with it until the phrase sticks!</p>
<p>In addition to the warm fuzzy feelings you'll get knowing you supported a young artist, here are some of the perks you get when you donate generously to this campaign!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Autographed CDs</p></li>

I’ve been busking and playing at local venues for several years, and I'm ready to take my career to the next level. Your donation KICKSTARTS my career!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It can feel risky to support a new artist. My take on it? This is your chance to support new, exciting, challenging Canadian music that otherwise won’t reach listening ears.</p>
<p>There is the risk I won’t reach my goal on Indiegogo. In addition to this campaign, I’m applying for TAC and federal arts grants. I'm not in the financial position to fund this project myself.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Firstly, thanks for checking out my campaign! I'm a musician and songwriter from Perth, Scotland and at the start of 2019, I started to focus on my own music, after years of being a part of other's projects. I LOVE music that's rooted in Rhythm and Soul which is exactly what this EP will be filled with!</p>
<p>Back in April, I self-funded and recorded my first single, 'The Good Times', which you can listen to here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/DJ3Wt099v3k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/DJ3Wt099v3k</a> - Since then, I've been working on 5 songs that will make up the new EP. The songs are grounded in Rhythm &amp; Blues but I explore the different sides of Soul and Jazz too. I've recorded the majority of the tracks myself, here in my home studio with the help of some of the most talented musicians in Scotland.</p>
<p>I'm all about positive relationships built on good energy, which I believe crowdfunding is a fantastic enabler of! Music is a healing medium and the idea that one of my songs could turn someone's day around fills me with such joy, which is why I wanted to embark on making this EP. And that's where you come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In short, to finish the EP, produce merchandise and fund a tour, I need £2,000.</p>
<p>For this campaign, I've decided to treat each of the following bullet points as a goal. If I reach the first, I can focus on the next one. If for instance, I only raise enough to mix and master the EP, I'll still be able to release something to the world. This way, it's not as much of a pressure to raise the full £2,000, though doing so will enable me to do a lot more!</p>
<p>Below, I've broken down my costs and where the funds will go:</p>
<p>• £800 - Mixing/Mastering Fees</p>
<p>Whilst I'm recording everything in my home studio, I need someone with the expertise to properly mix and master these songs.</p>
<p>• £600 - CD Production/Merchandise</p>
<p>Although CD players are quickly becoming a thing of the past, CD's are still a great thing to have at a show or when you meet people. I'll be doing a limited run of physical CD's along with some T-Shirts.</p>
<p>• £400 - Musicians Fees</p>
<p>I'm so lucky to know some of the most talented musicians in Scotland, and I think it's important that they're paid for their time.</p>
<p>• £200 - Tour Costs</p>
<p>As I'm planning to gig further away from home than I've been before, this will help with travel costs as well as room hire fees at certain venues.</p>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p>Total: Roughly £2,000</p>
<p>I'm mainly treating this campaign as a pre-order for the EP however there are some cool perks including a bundle of my previous releases and more tailored one's such as a unique acoustic recording.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I crowdfunded my first EP in 2016, I was really unsure if it was the right thing to do, however in the process of doing so, I made so many new meaningful connections with people through my music and the campaign! It was such an amazing feeling when I reached my target and being able to fulfil my goal to all the backers made all the stress worth while!</p>
<p>The impact this campaign will have will help me to really concentrate on my future as an artist and songwriter, with a focus on playing music with honesty, integrity and passion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Honesty and transparency are key. By staggering the £2,000 into the amounts mentioned above, I'm taking out the risk of an 'all or nothing' scenario. If I don't raise the full amount, I can still accomplish SOME of my goals.</p>
<p>By recording everything in my home studio, I'm removing the challenge of recording everything to a strict timescale such as those found in expensive recording studios. This gives me time to hone the sound and make it something that I'd be proud to let you all hear!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone can contribute financially, but you can still help.</p>
<p>Let as many people know about this campaign as possible. I love spreading joy and good times at my gigs and the same goes for online!</p>
<p>Even a £1 contribution gets me closer to my goal and believe me, it'll put the biggest grin on my face if you do!</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it! Thanks for your time and have an exceptionally wonderful day :)</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The journey of making this record has been a slow, difficult, sometimes utterly ridiculous, but also incredibly inspiring, and beautiful. </span></h3>
<p>When writing this music I was going through many new changes in my life. I had just moved to New York and began to undergo a shift in my perspective and goals. The experience of moving to New York and beginning a full-time career as a working musician has been incredibly brutal, and has thrown me in a tail-spin of doubt, insecurity, and constant self-assessment. But in that struggle I have discovered many beautiful things about myself, about what matters to me, about the people that matter to me, and becoming at peace with the process. This album is a reflection of that journey.</p>
<p>The writing for this record began in late 2015 and was finally recorded in September 2018. The album is centered around two different themes: Struggle with identity, and the struggle with morality, and living within that tension. Many of these compositions are inspired by the idea of super heroes. However noble or grandiose there alter egos are, a hero will at some point have to take off the mask and just live their live. They must embrace their flaws and compromise their relationships for a greater purpose. I am fascinated by what the day to day struggle is for someone with extraordinary abilities, but the same fragile moral compass as any of us. I think of how that is reflected my own life, and how I struggle with uncertainty, change, and what doing the right thing is. To me this album is a reflection of that struggle. To fight through uncertainty, to challenge your truths, and to believe in something incorruptible.</p>
<p>We are in the final stretch of this process, and my goal is to have this album out and in your hands by January or February of 2020. Every aspect of this record has been challenging, but incredibly fulfilling and impactful on my life. Funding it this much has caused major life changes has altered the way I perceive music and art. </p>
<p>I have become SOOOOOOOOOO grateful to all of my friends and fans. I have never been more inspired to put out music, and to go all in on my music. This record is a thank you to everyone who has supported me thus far, and I know it will live up to it. </p>

<h3>What is this album?</h3>
<p>This is a contemporary classical music album with a myriad of voices and instruments. The music was composed by Emily Lau, brought to life through devising and deep listening by The Broken Consort, set to the poetry of Emily Dickinson, Xu Zhimo, Emily Lau, and St. Francis of Assisi. It is a soundscape about love, grief, passion, beliefs, and joy. This album is co-produced by all of the artists performing on the project and has everyone's fingerprints all over it. </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Emily Lau (composer, singer, director), Peter Lim (recorders, oboes, keyboard), Julie Bosworth (singer), Jessica Korotkin (cello), Justin Persichetti (percussion), Joel Nesvadba (voice), Nick Hogle (voice), Sacha Muller (engineer)</p>
<p>************</p>
<p>The Broken Consort is an American-based chamber music ensemble presenting thought-provoking and innovative programs since 2010. Our musical and project ideas cover over 1000 years of music and stories, and the ensemble is made up of subject matter experts who care passionately about revitalizing and creating new repertory and artistic experiences.</p>
<p>Emily Lau is an award-winning composer, singer, and performance artist who founded The Broken Consort in graduate school with some of her friends. Since then, the ensemble has performed in leading music festivals, universities, concert series, and developed organically into its current formation. Members of The Broken Consort hail from diverse backgrounds and interests, live all across North America, and are joined together by their consummate artistry and demonstrated commitment to collaboration and innovation. </p>
<h3>Our Method of Collaboration</h3>
<p>TBC works exclusively in intensive residential setting, where project artists live, eat, breathe, dream, and work under the same roof, excluding outside distractions for 7-10 days. We did our project at Emily's home in Portland, OR and recorded the album at Dead Aunt Thelma's Studio with recording engineer Sacha Muller in June 2019. We laugh and cry daily from joy and frustration, and made a disc we are all in love with. </p>
<h3>Where We Are</h3>
</div><div><p>The album is recorded, mixed, mastered, and designed. We would like to give our closest circle a chance to experience a more personal product, and share our first 300 albums via this campaign only. The proceeds will greatly help us recoup our sizable production cost ($15,000 so far, because we value paying our musicians and engineers), and make our public release more impactful. We made this music based on trust, love, and relationships; it would only make sense to share this music through trust, love, and relationship. </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We do not have a lot of fancy promotional ideas, other than the beautiful music that we have made with our heart, and our attention to every artistic detail.

<h3>THE GOAL</h3>
<p>To finish a full album of original music. We want to share our music with you. Let's start in where we left off 20 years ago.</p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<p>All basic tracks are already completed (plus or minus 20 years ago!) drums, bass, acoustic &amp; electric guitars. The goal is to capture where we were...but to also build these songs to a fresh completion. We are NOT starting over. We are trying for very minimal re-tracking and doing so without the luxury of preproduction.</p>
<p>This funding will be utilized for recording vocals (excited to say some industry professionals to be featured), some overdubs with keys &amp; percussion, mixing, mastering and for manufacturing a small run of Cd’s and distribution to online music sites.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>A little history on the project… Rewind to the last months of 1999 when we were all wondering if the world would really end on January 1<sup>st</sup>. Ok, maybe computer grids would crash at best.  My ""old band"" (well we were young then) Idle Society, started in on a follow up to our 1997 release “Farewell Sybil”. Tom, Dan, Aaron and myself loaded our gear and headed to Rohnert Park’s the Foundry recording studio. With the help of Joel Cortrite and Chris Rake behind the console we tracked 13 songs. A few of which were still being written as we recorded. Our chops a bit sharper at this point, Aaron laid down some killer drum takes. With the energy of Stewart Copeland, intricacies of Neil Peart and feel of Carter Beauford, the hardwood floors and vaulted ceilings in The Foundry captured an amazing drum sound. That room just had the mojo. I recorded with my trusty American Fender Jazz bass for the round but punchy low end. I gave another run at fretless bass on one of the tunes. One of my proudest performances. I reserved my (later to be stolen and now sadly missed) Ibanez Precision bass for two of the more syncopated tracks on which I used a pick. That’s usually not my method but it served the song (or maybe I just couldn’t play that fast with my fingers back then; I’ll go with the former). Dan, if I recall correctly, moved away from his Stratocaster in favor of the Satch Ibanez. He busted out the 12 string for a feature as well. I had recently picked up a PRS on which Dan played on one of the more driving songs. In fact, he even played my Dad’s banjo on the same track. Sonic ear candy! Tom Laid down some of the acoustic tracks using the alternate tuning DADGAD. They still sound fresh today. The engineers did a superb job of double tracking and capturing a pleasant acoustic sound. Tom was prepped to start in on vocals and then boom. The band was no more.</p>
<p>So, before the album was able to be finished guess what? Yea the band broke up. We tried to hold it together looking for a replacement for Tom but nothing seemed to pan out. Eventually we all found other paths and the next chapter of our musical journeys. Dan and Aaron and I eventually played together again backing up Brain Cline…and then that changed as well.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years. I got the itch to work on this recording and eventually went to Faultline studio in SF to transfer all the Adat media to a digital hard drive Protools session. Wow, now we are in the modern era. Hearing those tracks did make me nostalgic. What was there sounded pretty good. No one else in the band seemed to want to breathe life back into the project. Should I just let this thing die already!?</p>
<p>NO! Fast forward another decade. Here we are and I still have this strong drive to get this material out. I just can’t let it go! Why? We had fun writing it and I’m proud of what we all did collectively. More importantly <u>music is meant to be heard and songs meant to be sung. You can help us achieve it</u>. So, let’s do this!!!</p>
<p>-Jason</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE MUSIC</h3>
<p>So, what will this sound like you ask? Well if you are into any popular rock that was put out over the last 50 years, sonically there will be a little something for everyone. Our musical peers might be the likes of  Vertical Horizon, Snow Patrol, Live, Dishwalla &amp; Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>Dan is a creative guitarist. Rather than playing to serve the song (which he often does) it’s more frequent the song develops from his guitar lines. Aaron is what you call raw talent, somewhat unbridled in these recordings. As for me I tried to be the glue between the rhythm and melody without getting bored. Exactly the role bass is supposed to play. We have diverse backgrounds musically but had common influences that will shine throughout.</p>
<p>Not straying too far from the radio rock vein, you might hear some flavors of The Police &amp; U2, splashes of Rush &amp; Dave Matthews Band, pop sense of The Goo Goo Dolls and the grit of Stone Temple Pilots. Equal parts 90’s rock and 80’s gloss. Organic acoustic sounds as well as aggressive riff-based grooves. 3 cups straight up ROCK, 1 cup singer-songwriter, a spoonful of jazz, and a pinch of shred.</p>
<h2><strong>BUDGET</strong></h2>
<p>As a completely independent project with no funds coming in from gigs, it’s completely funded by me. The only way these songs will continue to develop towards completion is working with vocalists &amp; some studio time. What can be done at home or remotely will be done at the best of our ability. As we all know vocals are the key ingredient and should be done without compromise.</p>
<p>The goal is <strong>$6,500</strong> to finish the recordings (with featured industry vocalists). If the goal is exceeded that means more can be spent on hiring a pro mixing engineer to mix the “best few songs”.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I don't reach the entire goal, it will take longer to put out the album. It’s just not in the family budget and I will have to slowly save up funds. I am dedicated to finishing this project whether we get help or not. I <i>promise</i> if the goal is not met there will <i>still be music released</i>.  It may only be a few songs  and only digital download. At least for the time being.</p>

<p>Der Rhythmus mag jeweils unterschiedlich sein, aber die Botschaft ist immer die gleiche.<br/><br/>Und die kann das Leben verändern wie diese fantastischen Musiker gezeigt haben. Das brasilianische Straßenorchester ""Orquestra de Rua"" aus Rio de Janeiro und das ""Ensemble Unterwegs"" aus Essen stammen aus zwei komplett unterschiedlichen Kulturkreisen, aber verfolgen das gleiche gemeinsame Ziel: Ihre Kunst zu teilen und sie Allen zugänglich zu machen. Das Ensemble Unterwegs möchte einen kulturellen und musikalischen Austausch anstoßen und das Orquestra de Rua im Frühjahr 2020 für 2 Wochen nach Deutschland einladen. Wir zählen auf euch, dieses wundervolle musikalische Event möglich zu machen.</p>
<p>Das Orquestra de Rua ist vor zwei Jahren in den Favelas, also den brasilianischen Armenvierteln, von Rio entstanden. Dabei starteten die vier jungen Musiker ihr eigenes soziales Projekt, was den dort lebenden Kindern wieder Hoffnung geben soll, die eigenen Träume zu verwirklichen und zwar mithilfe der Musik. So geben sie seitdem den Kindern die Möglichkeit, das Spielen klassischer Instrumente und klassischer Musik zu erlernen.</p>
<p>Sie verbreiten ihre Musik, indem sie beispielsweise auf der Straße, in Straßenbahnen und Schulen spielen. Immer verbunden mit dem Ziel, Musik für jedermann zugänglich zu machen und zeitgemäße Rhythmen/Musik mit klassischen Instrumenten zu kombinieren.</p>
<p>Das Ensemble Unterwegs besteht aus einer Gruppe von Profi-Musikerinnen, die sich vor acht Jahren in Essen gegründet hat. Für einige Wochen im Jahr gehen sie auf ""Walking Tour"" in Europa und geben spontane Outdoor-Konzerte in Städten und Dörfern. Dabei sind sie auf die Gastfreundschaft der Ortsansässigen angewiesen. Als Zeichen der Dankbarkeit für die wundervollen Musikdarbietungen öffnen die Einheimischen ihre Türen für die Musikerinnen, um Ihnen Unterkunft und Verpflegung anzubieten.</p>
<p>Die Chance, nach Europa zu kommen, würde für die jungen Musiker des Orquestra de Rua einige wichtige Möglichkeiten eröffnen:</p>
<p>- Musikprojekte in beiden Ländern zu fördern, die Kindern aus benachteiligten Stadtteilen helfen </p>
<p>- Europa als Geburtsstätte klassischer Musik kennenzulernen und direkten Zugang zur Klassik zu bekommen</p>
<p>- einen intensiven interkulturellen Austausch mit Ensemble Unterwegs und gemeinsames Musizieren mit ihnen</p>
<p>- an Proben mit diversen Gruppen der Kammermusik teilzunehmen</p>
<p>- rennomierte Institutionen und Musikhochschulen in NRW zu besuchen</p>
<p>- ihren eigenen Musikstil und ihre eigene Musikarbeit deutschen Musikstudenten zu präsentieren</p>
<p><br/>Und es gibt natürlich noch viele Gründe mehr, weshalb wir euch bitten, diesen Traum und dieses wundervolle soziale Projekt wahr werden zu lassen!</p>
<p>Unser Ziel ist es, 5.000€ an Spenden vor dem 01.Februar 2020 zu sammeln. So könnten wir beide Gruppen für einen unglaublich schönen Austausch von Musik, Rhythmus und Sound in NRW zusammenbringen und ein wichtiges soziales Projekt unterstützen.</p>
<p><br/>PS: Sollten eure Spenden 1.000€ überschreiten werden wir eine schöne Überraschung für euch haben als ein großes Dankeschön.</p>

<p>And it can change your life, as these musicians have proven! The Orquestra de Rua (Street Orchestra - from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and the Ensemble Unterwegs (Ensemble On the Road - from Essen, Germany) come from two completely different continents and cultures, but they have the same goal: to share their art and make it accessible to everyone.

And we are counting on you to make this beautiful meeting happen!</p>
<p>The Orquestra de Rua was born two years ago in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. These four young musicians started their own social projects that give children the opportunity to learn to play classical instruments and classical music - and help give them hope for achieving their dreams. Since then, they have spread their art by playing in the streets, subways and schools with the objective of combining contemporary rhythms and classical instruments – and of making music more accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>The Ensemble Unterwegs is a group of professional women musicians, founded eight years ago in Essen, Germany. For a few weeks every year they take their music on walking tours around Europe and present spontaneous concerts outdoors in towns and villages. They rely on the hospitality of the people they meet along the way, who open the doors of their homes and offer food and shelter to the artists as a way of thanking them for the gift of music.</p>

<p>I'm Cecilia Stalin and I'm a full-time artist, songwriter, educator and curator of a discussion event for creatives called The Fika Session. </p>
<p>Over the past 13 years I have started a record label, written 3 albums, 3 ep's, a few singles and recorded for many artist like KOOP, Jazzanova and toured around the world as a backing singer for Cinematic Orchestra, The Streets, Alicia Dixon to teaching vocal master classes in Australia &amp; China to working with some amazing institutions in London like Southbank Center, The Barbican and London Jazz Festival and of course Ronnie Scott's. What people don't seem to know about me is that I've done all this on my own, investing my own money write, rehearse, record &amp; press my music - and it's been an amazing journey so far. </p>
<p>This campaign is my first ever attempt to reach out to my family, friends and fans to ask for your help to take my vision to the next level. I've recorded a new album and I would love to be able to make a couple of music videos to deepen the connection with a visual to the music. I've never branched into visual with my songs so it would be an amazing creative challenge for me. </p>
<p>Your help will not only make it possible financially for me to make the videos but also emotionally to feel your lovely support and moving my creative sphere upwards! </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Funding:</h3>
<p>Soooo, I've got a surprise - I will be filming the videos in Brazil!!! This means that I can work with a smaller budget than in London so I will only be crowdfunding for £2500. I have over the last 2 years been going to Salvador da Bahia and I will be going back for a friends wedding and will take the opportunity to work with some local film makers. </p>
<p>The money will be spent on renting different types of cameras, drones, hire film crew, make up artists, hair stylists, and a director with an understanding of my music and a beautiful vision. I will definitely be able to film 2 music videos and will make sure that we have someone on staff to keep my Indigogo page updated whilst we shoot. </p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I invest my money back into my career and I've already made a decision to make a music video, so your money will definitely be very significant towards what I can do but not an end all. You'll just be able to see the full extent of my vision rather than a budget version ; ) </p>
<p>NOW...... <strong>what about those perks</strong>...... I've really done some research on this but also taken into account what I would LOVE to (and have) to get myself - so there will be everything from the basic Signed Cd + download to vinyl collection bundle to having your name on the album to private gigs at your house to having a tea with me! <strong>Go and check them out!!! </strong></p>

<h3>Behind the album...</h3>
<p>I.Am is my 3rd full length album and it's my most honest one. Honesty and vulnerability is something looked as 'weakness' in many situations but I've grown to learn that for me – it's a strenght and a power. So in order to be as honest as I could I decided to return to the 'live' sound, strip back the band, write from my heart and tell my stories. </p>
<p>I had noticed that I was focusing on what I didn't have, instead of all the great things I had done. When I looked at why, I quickly realised that I was comparing myself to the world around me and started to question why I wasn't 'doing as well'. Realising how much that disturbed my peace and work flow made me stop and really look at what I was doing to myself. </p>
<p>I.Am is a result of that inner look and being true to yourself, and I've learnt that making music is a snapshot of where you are in that moment. It's a journey, it's full of different stories and we should really celebrate it as we travel along it. </p>
<p><br/>The album will take you through a groovy and uplifting journey from Released, a song about her relationship with herself to  a cheeky Didn't you know about how women secretly emotionally run relationships to Brave, a song about facing your failures and getting back up to try again to Blunt-ly, a song about not holding back but saying what you think. <br/><br/>I have been working with a group of incredible musicians where the base is a trio featuring <br/>pianist Alex Bennett, a groove based musician who brings beautiful voicings and a lovely sensitivity, Tom Mason on electric bass who creates the solid foundation but has the most incredible harmonic understanding and wonderful timing and finally Laurie Lowe on drums who is the technical virtuoso but with soulfulness and incredible phrasing.<br/><br/>All songs are written by Cecilia Stalin but songs 6 &amp; 7 are co-written with London based pianist Joe Armon-Jones and songs 2, 4 &amp; 9 is co-written with Bennett/Lowe/Mason.  </p>

But as we've worked more together (officially 2 years since the first song we ever created!), we’re starting to think bigger. We’re starting to understand what our sound is, and we’re starting to realize and embrace the story that we want to tell with our music. We know that the best way to tell that story is with a project that we can put 100% of ourselves into - and that’s why we’re creating this EP - we want to do something bigger and better than we’ve ever done before, an expression of who we are as artists and people, and a glimpse into the way we see and experience the world around us.</p><p>As independent artists, we take a lot of pride in doing everything ourselves. From producing and writing our music, to handling our social media content and performances, to engaging with our fans individually - it’s a ton of work but it’s also the most fun in the world - and there’s no substitute for having control over your artistry. We’ve come to terms with the fact that we have to put in the work for this, that there are no shortcuts; that sleep sometimes just isn’t in the cards; that sometimes we have to sacrifice time spent with people we love and care about (and any of you who really know us - trust us, we HATE doing that) - it’s all part of the journey that we choose to be on every day. But the truth is, it’s IMPOSSIBLE to do everything alone, no matter how hard that is to accept. And for something like this, something that we really want to get done the right way, we came to a very simple but inevitable conclusion - we need help!</p><p>And that's where you come in. At the end of the day, we make music for all of YOU, and this journey isn’t just ours. We want you there with us, as you have been so far, every step of the way - not just watching it, but feeling like you're a part of it. Because you are! We really believe in this EP and we want it to be as spectacular as possible for everyone who listens to it, and so we don't want to cut any corners. </p><p>Take a look at the rewards. And if you don’t see anything there that you like, shoot us a message on Instagram or send us an email, and we’ll see what we can do to give you something special to you - to show that you’re special to us. </p><p>A HUGE thank you for sticking with us and for believing in what we’re trying to do. This journey is a wild ride, and trust us there are ups and downs - but the appreciation we get from all of you and seeing the way that some of our music has impacted folks all over the world, even if only for a few minutes - it makes everything worth it. Whatever you can contribute, just know that we appreciate it. However this thing gets done, we can’t WAIT to share it with you. For more info on what you’ll be specifically funding, take a look below!</p><h2>What we need help with:</h2><h3>Studio Time:</h3><p>While we do most of our work out of our home studio, in order to record our songs at the high-quality, professional standard necessary for releases, we have to record our final versions at a professional studio (better space, better acoustics, better equipment, tech engineers, etc.). We’ve been recently working out of Mad Oak Studios in Allston (right by where we live in Cambridge) and will be recording the rest of the EP there! We love it there, and can’t wait to show you the things they’ve helped us create with their awesome team.</p><h3>Collaborations:</h3><p>As we mentioned, while we like to do things ourselves, that never would have been possible for a project like this - nor would it be what we wanted. With Spectra, we’ve assembled an amazing team. We worked with incredible photographers to create the visual art for the EP, we’ve worked with designers to help with our merch, a videographer for the ‘Lonely’ video, and we are also working with two female vocalists on a couple of songs we’re VERY excited about, which will mean paying for their studio time as well as any costs associated with facilitating the recording. We wanted to bring some more voices into this project, and we think you’ll LOVE what they’ve added.</p><h3>Mixing and Mastering:</h3><p>We produce and write everything ourselves, but we leave the mixing and mastering to people who are WAY better at it than we are. We have a particular engineer that we’ve worked with ever since the ‘Falling Down’ release (he also mixed ‘Lonely’!), and we’ve hired him to mix our entire EP so that all of the songs will build on the same cohesive sound and work together the way we want them to.</p><h3>Marketing and Promotion:</h3><p>Making the music is one thing, but sometimes the even harder part is getting other people to know it exists. While we know that many of you will listen and we can’t thank you enough for it, in order for us to continue to grow, we need to reach new ears! We believe in the project and, through it, want to connect with as many people as possible.

Unfortunately, that can’t happen without putting some dedicated funding behind the songs themselves, from pitching them to editors and playlists to playing them on the road. Open Your Door Rome + RedInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thekeymakers/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WeAreTheKeymakers/Twitter: https://twitter.com/_TheKeymakers_",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Thanks for stopping by.</h2>
<p>I'm a New York City-based digital media content producer. I'm also a Disabled Military Veteran of the United States Marines and of Black and Queer identity. I'm producing a music video called ""BLACK + BLUE"". As a rap artist, I've made tons of videos at the different stages of my career. The more I produce that type of content, the more important it becomes because the way a song is contextualized can change people's minds.  It's important that people see the different ways blackness and queerness can be represented, so that others can see themselves living out their truth and fight for those struggling to find their own self-worth. I've seen a lot of change in the media accepting Black and Queer people, but until there is a day that a Black, Queer person can thrive without their survival on the line, or their rights threatened, or their equality questioned, then there is still work to do. I'm making this video to show young people a way to thrive being their most authentic self.</p>
<p>I need $10,000 to make this video look incredible and to pay the production team that will make that happen. The money goes towards ensuring the Director of Cinematography can access the best equipment and hire the best staff that will give the visual the best quality and professionalism. It will also go to the Creative Director and Production Manager to bring in a professional team such as a make-up artist, costume designer, set designer, plus book a versatile and top-notch location that makes videos come alive and make them memorable.</p>
</div><div><p>Everyone that donates will get credited in the video and as participant in the album-making process. This means that you will have the credit to your name officially and you can have an active role with the success of the album and the single. Whether I reach my entire goal or not, I will still produce the visual and it will still be released as planned and everyone credited accordingly. If I exceed the goal, I will make sure I donate some of the funds to an organization actively fighting for LGBTQ youth  (such as The Tyler Clementi Foundation) or for an organization involved with Queer and Black people in the arts.</p></div><div>

I have full confidence that this project can work and all milestones will be met.

<p>My name is Tommy Halloran. I am a songwriter/guitarist/singer living and working in St. Louis. I love to play. My band Tommy Halloran's Guerrilla Swing has racked up a few ""Best Jazz"" awards in the River Front Times, and the three records I've made in the past ten years have all been very well received and critically acclaimed.    </p>
<p>Now I am working on a new album of nine original songs with my musical comrades, bassist Max Kelly and guitarist Joe Park. I am very proud of this album. It will be called 'Just As Good As Feeling Good'. We recorded the album last week at Native Sound with Patrick Crecelius. Next we will have it mixed, mastered by Brad Sarno, create and layout the artwork, and send it off to be manufactured into 1,000 CD digipaks.  </p>
<p>From start to finish the project will run about $4000. If we can raise that amount over the next several weeks, we can release the new album this summer! So, please help us by pre-ordering the CD, making a donation, or going in for a private-performance perk!</p>

<h3>Le Projet</h3>
<p>Ça fait maintenant plus d'un an que je compose et chante mes chansons (en anglais), avec mon band de musiciens spécialement concocté. On a joué dans des salles de Montréal, comme la Casa del Popolo, dehors dans une cours arrière, comme au café Blanc de Blanc, dans des festivals, comme le Festival Atmosph'air sur ma Plaza. J'ai sorti deux singles: Butterfly et Love Beauty (<a href=""https://sara-danielle.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://sara-danielle.bandcamp.com/</a>). Et maintenant, je suis en studio pour enregistrer un album avec mes plus récentes chansons. Il sera lancé au printemps 2017!!!</p>
<p>Mon projet, c'est de la musique, des mots qui s'entrechoquent, des rêves, des émotions qui débordent un peu trop, des musiciens plein d'énergie et de créativité. Je veux enregistrer ces chansons parce que je crois sincèrement qu'elles ont une âme et le potentiel de rejoindre les gens.  Je le perçois et le vis quand je fais des spectacles. C'est aussi un stade important de ma carrière musicale. Jouer devant public, c'est toujours incroyable, mais le moment est venu de mettre tout ça sur un album, d'explorer mes idées et de les immortaliser. Je pourrai me faire entendre dans le milieu de la musique avec cet album et j'aurai une grande expérience dans mon bagage. Bien que je finance une partie du projet moi-même, j'ai besoin de votre aide pour le mener à bien et vous faire vivre avec mes chansons ce qui me fait tant tripper dans la musique!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ce que vous financez &amp; ce que ça vous donne</h3>
<p>Les coûts de l'album s'élèveront à 4600$. Je finance une partie du projet moi-même et avec l'aide d'autres campagnes de levées de fonds. Il reste 3000$ à couvrir, et tout ça comprend le temps de studio et le mixage, la paie de mes musiciens, le vidéo ""Live session"" pour une de mes chansons, les photos promotionnelles et qui serviront au design de l'album, le graphisme du projet ainsi que la duplication des CDs (pour qu'il y aie des belles copies physiques à tenir dans vos mains WOW). </p>
<p>Je vous offre plein de petites choses, et même des grosses choses, parce que vous m'aidez. Vous aurez un download de l'album, une copie physique, une journée en studio avec nous, moi et Karo qui jouons des tounes dans votre salon, selon votre contribution. Et même un show full band!!!!!</p>
<p>Si JAMAIS on n'atteint pas le montant prévu, ne vous inquiétez SURTOUT PAS: il y aura quand même des chansons. J'utiliserai vos dons pour enregistrer ma musique en plus petit format, et vous aurez quand même droit à vos petites choses qui viennent avec (CD physique, Karo et moi, etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>L'impact</h3>
<p>Cet album sera rempli de musique originale et de sensibilité, et vous fera ressentir des émotions et du groove que vous ne soupçonniez peut-être pas à l'intérieur de vous. Du moins, c'est ce qu'un artiste aspire à faire, et c'est ce que vous m'aiderai à accomplir en finançant cet album. Il me permettra de chanter ce que j'ai à dire et, je l'espère, de toucher les gens à travers ça. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>La Suite</strong></h3>
<p>Lorsque l'album sera terminé (YYYAAAAYY), je ferai un spectacle/party de lancement pour célébrer son arrivée dans le monde. Je donnerai un concert avec toutes les chansons de l'album mais aussi plusieurs autres, et il y aura des surprises et collaborations avec d'autres artistes. Pour la suite, je ferai la promotion de mon album dans les réseaux sociaux, auprès de la presse et des blogueurs, dans les radios, dans les maisons de disque. Bref: je diffusera mon contenu pour qu'il se fasse connaître. Je prévois également faire plusieurs spectacles et festivals à l'été 2017 pour promouvoir mon matériel. Vous, contributeur, jouerez un grand rôle dans le développement de ce projet artistique. Sans votre aide, l'album ne pourrait pas avoir un tel impact dans le milieu de la musique. Et ce n'est que le début de mon parcours musical!! Je vous tiendrez au courant de mes prochains shows, évènements, sorties de musique... Bref, tout ce qui se passera pour moi après l'album, car votre contribution ne se limite pas ici, elle me permettra de faire fructifier ma carrière et je tiens à vous en faire part. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<p>Avec tout projet dans la vie, il se peut que les choses n'aillent pas tout à fait comme on le veut. Dans mon cas, il est possible que je n'amasse pas tout l'argent nécessaire à la production de l'album. Il se peut aussi que sois malade une journée d'enregistrement de voix. Mais n'ayez crainte!! J'ai plusieurs tours dans mon sac et je saurai trouver des solutions. Je m'engage à vous fournir le meilleur de ma créativité sur cet album, avec toute les ressources que j'ai. C'est pourquoi j'ai absolument besoin que vous m'accompagniez dans cette aventure. Plus on est de fous, plus on crée!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Share the love</h3>
<p>Une autre façon de m'aider est, vous l'aurez deviné, de PARTAGER mon projet Indiegogo sur les réseaux sociaux!!! Ensemble, nous pourrons rejoindre beaucoup plus de gens. Peut-être votre père, tante, voisine d'en face ou ami de la famille voudra-t-il m'aider dans mon projet. Mais surtout, ça permettra au plus grand nombre de gens possible d'avoir entendu parler de mon album au moment où il sortira. So share the love everyone :)</p>

Si JAMAIS on n'atteint pas le montant prévu, ne vous inquiétez SURTOUT PAS: il y aura quand même des chansons. J'utiliserai vos dons pour enregistrer ma musique en plus petit format, et vous aurez quand même droit à vos petites choses qui viennent avec (CD physique, Karo et moi, etc.).
 

L'impact
Cet album sera rempli de musique originale et de sensibilité, et vous fera ressentir des émotions et du groove que vous ne soupçonniez peut-être pas à l'intérieur de vous. Du moins, c'est ce qu'un artiste aspire à faire, et c'est ce que vous m'aiderai à accomplir en finançant cet album. Il me permettra de chanter ce que j'ai à dire et, je l'espère, de toucher les gens à travers ça. 
 
La Suite
Lorsque l'album sera terminé (YYYAAAAYY), je ferai un spectacle/party de lancement pour célébrer son arrivée dans le monde. Je donnerai un concert avec toutes les chansons de l'album mais aussi plusieurs autres, et il y aura des surprises et collaborations avec d'autres artistes. Pour la suite, je ferai la promotion de mon album dans les réseaux sociaux, auprès de la presse et des blogueurs, dans les radios, dans les maisons de disque. Bref: je diffusera mon contenu pour qu'il se fasse connaître. Je prévois également faire plusieurs spectacles et festivals à l'été 2017 pour promouvoir mon matériel. Vous, contributeur, jouerez un grand rôle dans le développement de ce projet artistique. Sans votre aide, l'album ne pourrait pas avoir un tel impact dans le milieu de la musique. Et ce n'est que le début de mon parcours musical!! Je vous tiendrez au courant de mes prochains shows, évènements, sorties de musique... Bref, tout ce qui se passera pour moi après l'album, car votre contribution ne se limite pas ici, elle me permettra de faire fructifier ma carrière et je tiens à vous en faire part. 
 

Risques et défis
Avec tout projet dans la vie, il se peut que les choses n'aillent pas tout à fait comme on le veut. Dans mon cas, il est possible que je n'amasse pas tout l'argent nécessaire à la production de l'album. Il se peut aussi que sois malade une journée d'enregistrement de voix. Mais n'ayez crainte!! J'ai plusieurs tours dans mon sac et je saurai trouver des solutions. Je m'engage à vous fournir le meilleur de ma créativité sur cet album, avec toute les ressources que j'ai. C'est pourquoi j'ai absolument besoin que vous m'accompagniez dans cette aventure. Plus on est de fous, plus on crée!!
 

Share the love
Une autre façon de m'aider est, vous l'aurez deviné, de PARTAGER mon projet Indiegogo sur les réseaux sociaux!!! Ensemble, nous pourrons rejoindre beaucoup plus de gens. Peut-être votre père, tante, voisine d'en face ou ami de la famille voudra-t-il m'aider dans mon projet. Mais surtout, ça permettra au plus grand nombre de gens possible d'avoir entendu parler de mon album au moment où il sortira. So share the love everyone :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Let's try this ""again""</h3>
<p>My name is Floco Torres &amp; I'm a recording artist, musician &amp; songwriter born in Willingboro NJ, reppin Macon GA &amp; now living in Akron OH. Writing has always been my passion &amp; music helped me express myself on a more vast platform. I've gone from being homeless &amp; on the verge of taking my own life to being the happiest I've ever been because of music. If there's one thing I've learned throughout 10 years of creating a career as a musician, it's to don't be afraid to start over and try it again.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488498275/tsgaz6xabobu7zsljjlt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We've released countless <a href=""http://flocotorres7.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">projects</a> &amp; <a href=""http://youtube.com/user/FlocoTorres"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">videos</a> independently &amp; have played hundreds of shows with an immense amount of talented musicians over the years. Some projects &amp; shows have gained more attention than others, but I've always taken pride in knowing that one day, our message will make it to the <strong>main stage. </strong>That's what we want to achieve with our EP <i>again</i> &amp; full length album <i>Nobody Cares News.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488498316/hod19xfvgcbpynpqorvb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>
<p>Although we have been able to create art that we're extremely proud with just a few of us, we've now reached the point where we're asking for your help to keep moving forward. These two projects are equally about everyone involved because I would be nowhere without their willingness to collaborate. This campaign aspires to help us grow &amp; inspire multiple careers in music &amp; beyond.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>We are asking if you would help us raise funds to finish creating these two projects, more professional quality videos, &amp; to broadcast our movement to a higher level. We're asking you essentially to invest in our abilities to try again. </strong></p>
<p>To be more specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mixing/Mastering</strong> - We record ourselves and don't use fancy studios just to take Instagram pics in. But we do need engineers that love their craft &amp; have the ability to make our DIY setup sound crisp.</li>
<li>
<strong>Merch </strong>- I've tried to make my own merch in the past &amp; while fun, I know some artists who are much better at it than I am. </li>
<li>
<b>Video production </b>- We shoot our own videos &amp; we bought our own camera. But no amount of YouTube tutorials can trump a videographer that lives and breaths behind his/her lens.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing </strong>- The difference between your favorite local artist &amp; the famous one on the radio is usually who they know &amp; how much money they have. While we aren't chasing fame or radio dreams, we do aspire to work with more like minded industry pros that believe in our message &amp; will help spread the word.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paying our collaborators</strong> - These ladies &amp; gentlemen don't need another musician asking for a ""favor""</li>
</ul>
<p>Any &amp; all of your help here allows us to swing a little harder for the fence.</p>
<p>We want to thank you for your support by gifting you with some awesome merch &amp; bringing you along for the ride during this process. Our contribution levels will range from 10$ to 1000$ so for example,</p>
<ul>
<li>10$ contribution gets you both projects via digital download before they are everywhere.</li>
<li>25$ contribution gets you digital AND physical (signed) copies of both projects.</li>
<li>100$ contribution gets you a digital download, signed physical copy, liner note credit &amp; an""again"" merch pack (Shirt, sticker, koozie)</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on... (The gifts for your support are listing on the right side of this page in full)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These projects will help us continue to create art at a high level, reach larger audiences for our own work while exposing those audiences to so many other great artists/musicians/designers that we love. This is an opportunity to ascend &amp; to bring those we love with us.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488498459/czma8rtdu0z7nc5wge2e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is more than just creating music in a sense, I see it as shifting a paradigm in countless lives that without music, may never had crossed paths in the first place. I've always believed in myself, but I believe in the folks around just the same if not more. For those of you that have followed Floco Torres for a while, then you remember the movement we created with <a href=""http://flocotorres7.bandcamp.com/album/flocos-modern-life"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Floco's Modern Life</a>. This is a chance to do it better.</p>
<p>The only risk I've ever seen is being afraid to push forward. As a creative, you fight that battle everyday. We may not reach our full goal but what we do raise gets us one step closer.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please don't think that if you can't contribute monetarily, that you can't help or you aren't apart of this movement. If you know anyone that may be interested in helping, please use the social media sharing links to help us get the word out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to listen/read. We look forward to sharing new moments with you soon!</p>

<h3>I am Doctora Xingona Diana Alvarez.</h3>
<p>My ancestors bloom in my voice. With my music, I roar an otherworldly fire against oppression, exalt queer love and liberation, and create a gripping atmosphere for healing. My songs live as I do: in-between, where borders are a myth.</p>
<p>I am a singer-songwriter, poet, composer, filmmaker, educator, and scholar whose work centers transcendence, kinship, and the co-liberation and nourishment of BIPOC women, nonbinary, trans, and genderqueer artists.</p>
<p>The songs on my debut album <i>Ser Artista</i>, are songs from my award-winning show, <i>Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera</i>. <i>Quiero Volver</i> is a multimedia performance altar for women, nonbinary, trans, and genderqueer artists of color to convene and manifest futures. <i>Quiero Volver</i> features my original music, sonic text scores, a poem-script for ensemble performance, and documentary portraits from the BridgeSong Series, a virtual convening for artists of color to build coalitions for planetary healing. In 2018, <i>Quiero Volver</i> was produced at Smith College by grassroots organizers, and raised over $10,000 to support immigrant justice initiatives. In 2020, <i>Quiero Volver</i> was awarded a grant from the New England Foundation for the Arts, and will premiere as a video project in 2021. Performances from <i>Quiero Volver</i> benefit the BridgeSong Fund, a nourishing grant program for BIPOC Women, Nonbinary, Trans, and Genderqueer Musicians in Western Massachusetts. I founded the BridgeSong Fund in 2020 in collaboration with the Institute for the Musical Arts in Goshen, MA.</p>
<p>As you can see, the songs on <i>Ser Artista</i> are seeds that bloom far and wide to catalyze transformation and healing on the planet. </p>
<p>I would love for you to join me on the journey of releasing my music to you, across the universe!</p>
<p>This campaign will support production, mixing, mastering, graphic design, distribution, and publicity for <i>Ser Artista</i>, so that I can start releasing songs as early as April 2021. The expected release date for the album is September 2021. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ser Artista Budget Goals</h3>
<p>In the most ideal circumstances, I will raise enough money for the following album expenses:</p>
<p>Production, Mixing, and Mastering - $10,000</p>
<p>Graphic Design - $3,000</p>
<p>Distribution - $100</p>
<p>Limited CD printing and materials - $2,000</p>
<p>Publicity - $3,000</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>Total - $18,100</p>
<p>My budget goal is ambitious, as I am. Should I reach a smaller target, I will put all funds toward production, mixing, mastering, and digital distribution. My goal is to start releasing singles from this album in April. Your support will help me reach this goal!</p>
<p>To entice you further, I have exclusive perks including voice lessons, handwritten notes, outdoor concerts, and virtual workshops!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ser Artista Impact</h3>
<p>In supporting this project, you are supporting a debut music album created by a genderqueer Xicana independent artist from South Texas, who is the first in her family to attend college, let alone pursue an MFA in Poetry...let alone pursue and EARN a doctorate in Electronic Arts. </p>
<p>It is my ethos to circulate abundance. <i>Ser Artista</i> is my gift to community across the universe who feel in-between, who seek chosen familia, who are brilliant for their multifaceted ways of being. This album is my way of directly nourishing chosen family. As with all my work, when I am offered support, I redistribute wealth to support my community, especially QTBIPOC fam. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Let's do this!!!!</h3>
<p>I am committed to seeing this album project through. I need your support. I invite you to contribute financially to this campaign, but also to get the word out and make some noise about this Indiegogo campaign. Please email your friends! Shoutout the campaign on social media!</p>
<p>Mil gracias for your support. I continue to create for you/us. </p>

<h3><strong>""Solitary Heart""</strong></h3>
<p><i><u><strong>The inspiration behind solitary heartfelt lyrics...</strong></u></i></p>
<p>            The former frontman of a popular local band in Reno, NV. called <strong>TWENTY4SEVEN</strong>; <strong>Vinnie Valentino</strong> has had his fair share of life challenges and has had to work through setbacks on this journey. The inspiration behind <strong>""Solitary Heart""</strong> is a paradox of two different types of loneliness. <strong>""Solitary Heart""</strong> captures the individuals' search for social acceptance and the quest for finding a complementary soulmate. Several years of in-activity in musical endeavors and being single had ultimately left the singer lost and lonely. The song takes the listener on a journey to try to answer common questions of how some are lucky in love, while others are left behind. And what hope is there for the lonely to find love? <strong>""Solitary Heart""</strong> taps into mankind's quest for intimacy and emotions that we all struggle with.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9E-r3Jjg88?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div>          Upon completion of recording, mixing, and producing <strong>""Solitary Heart""</strong> at <strong>Imirage Sound Lab,</strong> music producer <strong>Tom Gordon</strong> suggested that <strong>Valentino</strong> should release the single with a music video... And referred him to <strong>Cameron Paris</strong> of <strong>Firebolt Media.</strong> And so <strong>Vinnie Valentino</strong> set out to embark on making his very first music video!<br/>         From their first meeting onward <strong>Cameron Paris</strong> had a vision for the song and suggested that they should go out on location to a remote stretch of highway known as <strong>{The Loneliest Road in America} HIGHWAY 50. </strong>And then began developing the idea of Vinnie walking along the long lonely highway, with no one to talk to, except for the billboards above.<br/>         According to Mr. Valentino,<i> ""Making <strong>Solitary Heart (Official Music Video) </strong>was an adventure in my life, and I'm looking forward to filming more videos.""</i>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>So let's cut to the chase:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're a three piece rock band that's been together since 2014</li>
<li>Since that time, we've NEVER done any fundraising like this</li>
<li>Every Music Video, Photoshoot, Studio Recording Session, Album release, EP release, Single release, Merch release, Car ride to gigs, etc - has ALL been paid for out of our back pockets</li>
<li>We worked out that we've spent a minimum of £15,000 over the years in creating this band from the ground up and have only ever asked people to listen to songs which we are proud of</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we've reached that creative peak, but our finances are depleting rapidly - which is why we wholeheartedly turn to you beautiful people!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It's as simple as this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a minimum of £500 and a maximum of £1,000 (anymore than that is just greed!)</li>
<li>Any amount within that bracket will pay for the duplication costs of the new album we've finished, will give us the proper packaging this album deserves, from the lyrics booklets, to innovative art design for the front cover, back cover, CD disc design, Vinyl design, etc!</li>
<li>Should we fail to reach the minimum target in time, then the money that we receive will simply go towards the final cost and we will cover what's needed! :) </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What's In This For You?</h3>
<p>The main reason why we've never asked for donations for all our previous projects is because we never had any 'perks' to offer at that time, whereas now we do! So each donation has a reward, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a part in one of our Music Videos which will be on VEVO!</li>
<li>Getting your name credited in our Album Liner Notes (both on CD, Vinyl &amp; social media)!</li>
<li>Receiving a FREE copy of the New Album in a format of your choice!</li>
<li>Being added to our VIP Lists for future gigs (announced ones and ones in the works!)</li>
<li>First class delivery of Original Lyrics Sheets, signed by all three of us with personalised messages of your choice!</li>
<li>Spend a day with 2OS in either a Live Session, Studio Session or Jamming with us!</li>
<li>Coming up with the title of a future 2OS song!</li>
<li>ONE OFF - Signed by all three of us - 18"" Sabian Crash Symbol which was been used on ALL our Recordings to date!</li>
<li>FREE Signed Copy of our debut album 'Ascended From Colours'!</li>
<li>Have us write a Song JUST FOR YOU!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Another major reason why we are struggling to fund this ourselves is because of the giant Covid elephant in the room, it's unavoidable, we understand that EVERYBODY has been affected by the Pandemic, not just physically but financially too. We will never turn away from the fact that asking for donations in today's world is like asking for a Covid-free world - it just isn't easy, we totally respect that. However, if just 100 people out of the 65 million UK Citizens donated a fiver each towards this campaign, then it's job done! </p>
<ul>
<li>We put money where our mouth is - so by helping us out, we help you in return. Your hard earned money will be met with a reward, consider it a guaranteed investment or a simple purchase. You're paying for something that nobody else can buy when the campaign is over, think of it like that!</li>
<li>As time goes on and each day provides us all with new challenges, we will continue to adapt to each of them every single day! You worried about posting issues? Done. We will set up the best delivery system with tracking numbers and guaranteed delivery charges on top of it... You worried about not being able to travel? Done. We will accommodate any traveller as soon as it is safe to do so, providing the best for your buck and covering the costs! We got you!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Money isn't the only way you can contribute towards this campaign, spread the word!</li>

So let's cut to the chase:

We're a three piece rock band that's been together since 2014
Since that time, we've NEVER done any fundraising like this
Every Music Video, Photoshoot, Studio Recording Session, Album release, EP release, Single release, Merch release, Car ride to gigs, etc - has ALL been paid for out of our back pockets
We worked out that we've spent a minimum of £15,000 over the years in creating this band from the ground up and have only ever asked people to listen to songs which we are proud of

Now we've reached that creative peak, but our finances are depleting rapidly - which is why we wholeheartedly turn to you beautiful people!

What We Need
It's as simple as this:

We need a minimum of £500 and a maximum of £1,000 (anymore than that is just greed!)
Any amount within that bracket will pay for the duplication costs of the new album we've finished, will give us the proper packaging this album deserves, from the lyrics booklets, to innovative art design for the front cover, back cover, CD disc design, Vinyl design, etc!
Should we fail to reach the minimum target in time, then the money that we receive will simply go towards the final cost and we will cover what's needed! :) 


What's In This For You?
The main reason why we've never asked for donations for all our previous projects is because we never had any 'perks' to offer at that time, whereas now we do! So each donation has a reward, such as:

Having a part in one of our Music Videos which will be on VEVO!
Getting your name credited in our Album Liner Notes (both on CD, Vinyl & social media)!
Receiving a FREE copy of the New Album in a format of your choice!
Being added to our VIP Lists for future gigs (announced ones and ones in the works!)
First class delivery of Original Lyrics Sheets, signed by all three of us with personalised messages of your choice!
Spend a day with 2OS in either a Live Session, Studio Session or Jamming with us!
Coming up with the title of a future 2OS song!
ONE OFF - Signed by all three of us - 18"" Sabian Crash Symbol which was been used on ALL our Recordings to date!
FREE Signed Copy of our debut album 'Ascended From Colours'!
Have us write a Song JUST FOR YOU!


Risks & Challenges
Another major reason why we are struggling to fund this ourselves is because of the giant Covid elephant in the room, it's unavoidable, we understand that EVERYBODY has been affected by the Pandemic, not just physically but financially too. We will never turn away from the fact that asking for donations in today's world is like asking for a Covid-free world - it just isn't easy, we totally respect that. However, if just 100 people out of the 65 million UK Citizens donated a fiver each towards this campaign, then it's job done! 

We put money where our mouth is - so by helping us out, we help you in return. Your hard earned money will be met with a reward, consider it a guaranteed investment or a simple purchase. You're paying for something that nobody else can buy when the campaign is over, think of it like that!
As time goes on and each day provides us all with new challenges, we will continue to adapt to each of them every single day! You worried about posting issues? Done. We will set up the best delivery system with tracking numbers and guaranteed delivery charges on top of it... You worried about not being able to travel? Done. We will accommodate any traveller as soon as it is safe to do so, providing the best for your buck and covering the costs! We got you!


Other Ways You Can Help

Money isn't the only way you can contribute towards this campaign, spread the word!
Every social media share or word of mouth mention increases the likelihood and reality of more people donating and receiving their rewards and helping us get over the finish line!

And that's all there is to it. We love you and we thank you for taking the time to read this! We now leave in your hands, don't drop us! - Aaron, Tommy & Grant xxx",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi Friends and Internet Neighbors,  <br/></p>
<p>My name is
Patrick von Wiegandt and I'm here to do a little digital begging for money to
record my new CD - called SWANKY AT ABBEY ROAD (yes, that Abbey Road....Studio
2.... ""The Beatles Room."" !!!! )  I've never done this so it's a bit
strange for me - but since I'm here, I'll go for it. <br/></p>
<p>My goal is to raise
$15,000 to record this new CD. It's the 3<sup>rd</sup> in a series called
SWANKY. The first was recorded with 23 time Grammy Winner Al Schmitt at Capitol
Studios in Hollywood…..and multiple Grammy winner musician Bill Champlin and a
host of the best studio musicians in Hollywood and Honolulu.</p>
<p>I’ll be
working with some of the best studio musicians in London on the basic tracks
and overdubs and then finish the CD in Los Angeles and Honolulu with the
terrific musicians who played on the first 2 Swanky CDs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A Little Background About the Swanky
Series</b></p>
<p>The Swanky series is inspired by
music of the 1920’s to 40’s - The Jazz Age -  and include some of the most elegant and
sophisticated songs ever written. Composers such as Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Rogers and Hart and so many more created a style that has remained timeless. There were also many wonderful character type songs crafted then and many tunes from what is called The Great American Songbook. I think the word ""Swanky"" really captures the mood and elegance of that era. </p>
<p> I've loved this music my whole life, thanks to my parents and their friends who played it and taught it to us as we were rocking and rolling (and The Beatles also included some of these songs and styles in their records.)  I've also been inspired by many of my friends and contemporary musicians who love and perform this music – so it’s been a fun journey to share it with them too. We have a lot of fun making these records in a contemporary style while honoring the originals.<br/></p>
<p><b>Playing for Seniors</b></p>
<p>It’s especially gratifying to play
this music for the older generations, who were the ones who brought it to us in
the first place. When we play these songs it’s nice to hear the older clan talk
about their first memories of the tunes. My mother was very happy to hear me
play these pieces since she and my dad had played them to us as we were growing
up - and she would get my brothers and sisters in a tizzy when she would play old songs, ragtime and especially the song Darktown Strutters Ball.<br/></p>

studios.  It’s a thrill and a challenge.
I think we pulled it off with SWANKY 1 and 2. Now we have the chance to work with
some terrific players in London who also know and love the music we have been

Concert with me and my Swanky pals…..and, if you’d like to pony up some big
British pounds – Executive Producer credit and a trip to the studio with us in London, Los Angeles or Hawaii. And, of course, you get bragging
rights for sending me to London. That ought to warm your heart. Not sure if that will make you rich or happy – but it just might put a smile on your face when you are riding down the highway listening to this new Swanky CD in your car….. thinking….. I helped make this happen.<span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>THE FLUFF……..The main perk, I’ve been told, of any
of these fundraising campaigns, is to be part of the project and help it move
forward. We’ve had success in bringing this music out of the closet so to speak
– and it’s been fun to work and play with the musicians who really love this
music and want it carried on. A lot of you have said very nice things to us about the songs and the way we present them -  and, you have come to see us perform, so I think we are on to something special. And..... we've been building the ""Swanky"" brand (for whatever that's worth.)</p>

<p>“If you have failed and fallen as I have</p>
<p>And long to be forgiven</p>
<p>Walk out under the graphite sky”</p>
<p>~ by Dorothy Trogdon, from the poem ‘Under The Graphite Sky’</p> <h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Sam Genders. I have been a musician since I was 15 and I've toured the world and played festivals such as Glastonbury, Latitude, Green Man, Haldern Pop and Iceland Airwaves with my various bands Tunng, The Accidental, Diagrams and Throws.  Independent record label Full Time Hobby has released six of my albums, my songs have had regular airplay on BBC 6 Music, Xfm and more, and my previous band Tunng was once nominated in the UK BBC 2 Folk Awards for 'Best Group'.</p>
<p>The last couple of years have taken me on an amazing journey during which I met an incredibly talented 90-year-old poet named Dorothy Trogdon, wrote an entire album’s worth of songs with her and then recorded that album with some of my all time favourite producers and musicians.</p>
<p>I’ve created this campaign to fulfil a life-long dream of setting up my own home-based record label so that I can self-release the album out into the world. Your generous contributions will make all of this possible:</p>
<p>~ designing beautiful artwork for the album<br/>~ mastering and manufacturing the CDs and vinyl<br/>~ making downloads available<br/>~ distributing the album to record shops all over the world<br/>~ promoting the album in all the right places to reach as many listeners as possible</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The story so far...</h3>
<p>This project has felt special to me from the very first time I read one of Dorothy’s poems and found myself turning it into a song in my mind. That poem was called ‘Mnemosyne’ and I loved its combination of mythological and scientific imagery along with a rich sense of human vulnerability and the precious nature of our minds, memories and fleeting lives.</p>
<p>I felt like a nervous kid when I emailed Dorothy to ask if she might help me write some songs and so excited when she agreed. Later on I was encouraged by how inspired people were by her involvement and I was enthused by their willingness to get involved and help make the album a reality.</p>
<p>Producers Mike Lindsay (Tunng, Farao, Low Roar, Speech Debelle) and Kristofer Harris (Smoke Fairies, Storybooks) offered their time, as did some brilliant instrumentalists  - brass player Sam Ewens and violinist Danyal Dhondy as well as drummer Rob Wilks and singers Astra Forward and Tim Barr.</p>
<p>I even had a reply to a shot in the dark email I sent to world-renowned multi-instrumentalist / composer / arranger Kelly Pratt (Arcade Fire, St Vincent, David Byrne, Beirut) who agreed to record arrangements for the album.</p>
<p>My friend Marion, who first gave me Dorothy’s book and started this amazing journey, visited Dorothy where she lives on Orcas Island outside of Seattle, Washington State, and took my old dictaphone with her to make field recordings.</p>
<p>The icing on the cake was being awarded a £2,500 grant by the PRS for Music Foundation, which when added to my own savings meant I had enough to start making the album.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the recording process I had the privilege of visiting Dorothy for the first time.  It was wonderful to meet her and spending time there gave me a real connection to the field recordings that appear on the record, such as the soft buzz of hummingbirds that feed throughout the day by Dorothy’s back door in view of the sea and nearby woodland.</p>
<p>This album exists because of the enthusiasm of the amazing and creative people involved.  We’re all really happy with the finished result and we think people will love the record.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our team and who we are...</h3>
<p>My wife Sofia and I will be running this very exciting campaign from our house in Sheffield, England with a small team of friends. As you already know, I’m a musician and songwriter who has released 6 albums and toured many places around the world with the bands Tunng, The Accidental, Throws and Diagrams. I also work as a songwriter for other artists such as Liam Bailey, Ben Ottewell and more, and I run songwriting courses and teach kids guitar in primary schools.</p>
<p>Music, words, ideas and compassion are what most inspire me. I love science and nature.</p>
<p>Sofia co-founded the amazing End of the Road Festival which is held in the Dorset countryside in England each September. Her organisational skills, attention to detail and positivity are a big part of the reason the festival became so successful and she’ll be helping me run the campaign properly without me getting sidetracked by my childishly enthusiastic and sometimes confusingly random creative brain.</p>
<p>We have a great team of musician friends, colleagues and collaborators who are supporting this project. Thank you so much Marion McLaren, Mike Lindsay, Kristofer Harris, Kelly Pratt, Rob Wilks, Sam Ewens, Danyal Dhondy, Astra Forward, Tim Barr, Sophie Jane Mortimer, Leon Lockley, Matt Bagguley, Zoe Genders, Kate Hewett, Howard Monk, Suzie Kemner, Ian Smith, Jennifer Madeley, Tamara Gal-On, Ben Charles, Jess Roberts, Helen Mort, Niki Stevens, Guy Whittaker, Leonie Sloots, Sara Hill, Heather Hull, Mike Hull, Becky Matthews, Matt Austin, Rachel Mepsted, Jane Aspeling, Katy Blott, Lucy Jamieson, Orlando Seale and Paddy Fairlamb.</p>

And long to be forgiven
Walk out under the graphite sky”
~ by Dorothy Trogdon, from the poem ‘Under The Graphite Sky’ About This Project
Hello, my name is Sam Genders. I have been a musician since I was 15 and I've toured the world and played festivals such as Glastonbury, Latitude, Green Man, Haldern Pop and Iceland Airwaves with my various bands Tunng, The Accidental, Diagrams and Throws.  Independent record label Full Time Hobby has released six of my albums, my songs have had regular airplay on BBC 6 Music, Xfm and more, and my previous band Tunng was once nominated in the UK BBC 2 Folk Awards for 'Best Group'.
The last couple of years have taken me on an amazing journey during which I met an incredibly talented 90-year-old poet named Dorothy Trogdon, wrote an entire album’s worth of songs with her and then recorded that album with some of my all time favourite producers and musicians.
I’ve created this campaign to fulfil a life-long dream of setting up my own home-based record label so that I can self-release the album out into the world. Your generous contributions will make all of this possible:

<p><span>I am a resident artist and musician based in Providence at AS220, a nationally renowned unjuried, uncensored creative space and artist community. I was a producer and performer for the first international artist exchange between San Francisco and Czechoslovakia after the the Velvet Revolution. I was a long term collaborator with the late computer music pioneer Max Mathews at Stanford University. I have even sung in the monastery where Charlemagne's wife was exiled! </span></p>
<p>I have been so fortunate as a vocalist, improviser, and composer to travel the world, collaborate, and share music with a diverse range of incredibly talented people. Now based in Rhode Island, I want to bring the national and international looping scene to Providence and showcase the brilliant pool of local looping talent. This festival is an opportunity to expand our reach through the Y2K community.</p>
<p>The annual Y2K International Live Looping Festival began in 2001 and is known as the premiere and longest running live looping festival. To this day, in our community, there is no style or genre of music associated with the movement. The only thing that links thousands of emerging and established live looping artists is a strong and supportive sense of community and a love for the concept of looping live in public.</p>
<p>We have done the work to create a huge network of supporters to help launch the festival. We have the blessing and support of the Y2K family. We are performing at AS220. We have integrated multiple local community organizations including AS220 Youth, Girls Rock, and the City of Providence to promote local artists and to produce free events. We’ll also have an amazing team of volunteers to help round out the staff we’ll need to make the festival happen.<br/></p>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>Hello there! My name is Avi Diamond. I am a singer-songwriter out of the Pittsburgh area, and I need your help to put out The <i>Wolfmother</i> EP. This new project is a stylistic departure from my previous album, <i>Down the Drain</i>, featuring songs that are influenced by Acoustic-Folk, Rock, and Bossa Nova. </p>
<p>Shortly after releasing my first album, I moved upstate for a Music Therapy internship in the Catskill mountains. I experienced healing and renewal while living in a house in the woods and going on frequent adventures in my surroundings. This setting mixed with life experiences inspired me to write new music. <br/><br/>If I reach my goal, I will have the resources to share music that will hopefully take you through an emotional journey. I wrote these songs during a time when I was starting to realize who I was beyond what other people wanted me to be. I hope that I can also inspire you to live genuinely.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cost Breakdown</h3>
<p>Since I now have the experience of successfully crowd-funding a similar project, I can anticipate bumps in the road that were unexpected in my first campaign and optimize your contributions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio Recording Fees: $2,000</li>
<li>EP Distribution: $200</li>
<li>EP Artwork and Design: $500</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fee: $150</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h3>How You can Help</h3>
<p>Contributions of any amount are greatly appreciated and will be acknowledged in my final project in the EP liner notes. Even just a couple of dollars will bring us closer to our goal and draw attention to the Campaign. <br/>You can also help by spreading the word. All it takes is a quick share on social media or mentioning it to a friend. :) </p>
<p><br/>Thank you so much for your love and support as we embark on this crowd-funding journey together again or for the first time! I am so excited to connect with all of you. </p>

<h3>About The Whistling Dixie Graveyard Project</h3>
<p><strong>Music for the Resistance</strong></p>
<p>Hi Folks, My name is Paul Metsa. I am a singer- songwriter born on the Mesabi Iron Range in Northeastern MN and have been living in Minneapolis since 1978. I am asking you to support a multi-leveled musical project of mine that I believe can provide a  powerful soundtrack for the progressive movement in America. <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-guitar-brings-voters-to-the-polls-songwriter_us_5820aaa5e4b0102262411ae8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can learn more about me in the Huff Post by clicking here. </a></p>
<p>I am making an appeal to you to fund my IndieGoGo campaign to support the operational costs of releasing 3 original CD's, 2 new singles called ' Ain't Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore', and 1 remastered CD.  In the event that we have a surplus of funds, after meeting all project related expenses, we will donate the unused funds to organizations that work towards racial advancement. In an effort to be transparent we will notify all backers of this campaign of any surplus funds donated to charity. Net proceeds from my next music release 'Ain't Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore' will benefit organizations that work for equality and racial advancement, via non profit record label Rock the Cause Records. </p>
<p>If you would like to make a direct donation to this project that is tax deductible you may do say at <a href=""http://irockthecause.org/donate-now"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://irockthecause.org/donate-now </a>   </p>
<p>My new song ""Ain’t Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore"" was inspired by an article in Esquire.com by Charles Pierce after the tragic march in Charlottesville Virginia on August 12th of 2017 that took the life of American Patriot Heather Heyer and two state troopers. The chorus goes, ""Bury that song in the land of Cotton, deep in the Delta Mud to be long forgotten, I Aint’ Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore"". The song honors not only  Heather Heyer, but also pays tribute to the over  million soldiers, between the Civil War and WW2, who gave their lives fighting slavery and fascism. It is a call to action to continue the great civil rights work of the 1950's and 1960's. My song protests the injustices and inequality that people of color, women, and the LGBQT community live with daily! It also calls out the Alt right for what they are, Un American! I Ain’t Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore, I believe, could be the new anthem for the resistance.</p>
<p>The song features legendary soul singer Wee Willie Walker, who recorded his first single I’m a Lucky Loser in 1967 with a young guitar player named Duane Allman, and 3 time Grammy Award winners The Sounds of Blackness. We are also working on a hip hop version of the tune as well with High School for Recording Arts (HSRA). Hip-Hop education professionals across the nation have praised the collaboration with HSRA as a new model for teaching young people American History and about Civil Rights.</p>
<p>The Lyrics to 'I Ain't Going to Whistle Dixie Anymore' are below. </p>
<p>I saw your Tiki Torch parade on the blood red evening news,</p>
<p>I remembered Timothy McVeigh and that Jesus was a Jew,</p>
<p>Benedict Arnold waits for you in the hottest place in Hell,</p>
<p>The screaming souls will drown you out-your Seig Heil Rebel Yell</p>
<p><u>Chorus</u></p>
<p>Ain’t Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore, ain’t gonna whistle Dixie anymore</p>
<p>Bury that song in the land of cotton, deep in the Delta mud to be long forgotten</p>
<p>Ain’t Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore</p>
<p><u>2<sup>nd</sup> Verse:</u></p>
<p>Fallen soldiers that were left behind, we salute on wounded knee</p>
<p>Sacrifice of the highest kind, from Gettysburg to Normandy</p>
<p>Burn your crosses, mask your face, sing the Appomattox Blues</p>
<p>Woody Guthrie told us long ago, fascists are bound to lose, fascists born and bound to lose</p>
<p><u>Repeat Chorus</u></p>
<p>Charlottesville Virginia, August 12<sup>th</sup> of ‘17</p>
<p>Emancipation Park and Dixie flags flew across the village green</p>
<p>4 wheels of hate on 4<sup>th</sup> street raced where Heather Heyer died</p>
<p>Now her Blue Ridge Mountain Angel voice forever magnified, forever magnified</p>

<p>I also want to release a remastered 25th Anniversary re-release of my 1993 album Whistling Past the Graveyard, including bonus tracks.  Bucky Baxter was in town playing with Bob Dylan in 1992, a cab driver told him he might want to check me out at a weekly gig of mine, and after listening to a set offered to do a demo for me at his studio in Nashville that he owned with Garry Tallent, long time bass player in Bruce Springsteens E Street Band. The first 4 songs went so well, we recorded another 4 and released it in 1993.  All songs feature Bucky and Garry and also  George Marinelli, Bonnie Raitt’s  longtime guitarist. It features 4 other politically charged and radio ready songs that are as timely today as when they were written.  </p>
<p>One song,Slow Justice features the line, ""And as the world goes around all I want to ask is, if the rich mans owns the land, why must the poor man pay the taxes?"". The Mpls. Star Tribune called it the most “all-purpose protest tune since Blowin in the Wind.</p>
<p>You can hear some of these tunes, for free, on our Indie Go Go Page.</p>

<h3>We Can Not Do It Alone </h3>
<p>I am working with the internationally acclaimed nonprofit record label Rock the Cause Records to help me make this project available to the world. Over the past decade Rock the Cause has sold over 500,000 charitable music singles, close to 60,000 digital albums and CD's, and their releases have been streamed over 30 Million times. All of this has added up to Rock the Cause being able to direct close to $750,00 in revenues from the sale of their music releases to charitable causes like children's health, education, and human rights organizations. I know I have the right partner to get the job done.  </p>
<p>In order to get the job done and make the impact we want to make this project needs funding. The record label will administrate the funds. We need you to help fund this project!</p>
<p><strong>Here is how your funding for this project will be spent:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Impact Of Funding the Project</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>I LIKE TO THINK my songs are bullets of love in the machine gun of peace. I want to put these tunes into the political pipeline, have them blast forth from the radio, and let them be shared and sung by all those in the progressive and resistance movement. Like Pete Seeger said, A GOOD SONG REMINDS US WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, Rock the Cause Records will be releasing both versions of 'I Aint Going to Whistle Anymore' worldwide on August 8, 2018, distributed by Sony.  'Ain't Gonna Whistle Dixie Anymore' will be available on all digital service platforms i.e. iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, Google etc. 50% of all net proceeds from the digital revenues  of 'Ain't Gonna to Whistle Dixie Anymore' will be donated to organizations that work towards racial advancement TBA. The remaining digital revenues will be split between the songwriters - we have additional songwriters on the Hip-hop version that I will also get songwriting credit.      </p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to create a ""lightning in a bottle"" musical response to those who want us to go backwards, slipping into the darkness of hate, poverty, and social injustice! </p>
<p>With the right funding, in an age of unprecedented digital media, we can share the music far and wide. We can provide a daily soundtrack that empowers others to speak up and get involved in building communities that are free from racism, prejudice, ignorance, fear, poverty and hate. THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL!</p>
<p>If we are unable to fund this campaign. We will push through. The few will carry the weight for the many. Please help us carry the weight.    </p>
<p>The Left owns the music. Now lets USE this music to help take our country back.   And remember, There is beauty in the struggle, and never let the bastards get you down. Thanks for your time and consideration.</p>

<p><i>Je crois que chaque vie est sacrée, que chaque personne mérite d'être respectée que  chaque personne devrait pouvoir vivre sa vie sans se faire briser, cependant, je sais que ce n'est pas toujours le cas. C’est pourquoi je veux faire un album de musique pour aider celles et ceux qui ont été blessés. Je veux communiquer avec leurs coeurs en leur offrant un début de guérison. Pourquoi? Parce que je suis une chanteuse, une compositrice, une interprète et une survivante de viol. Les surplus de la campagne, une partie de l'argent des ""perks"" (récompenses), comme les profits des ventes de l'album iront à une organisation soutenant les victimes d'agression sexuelle, les CALACS.</i><br/> </p>
<div><strong>I am a singer and a songwriter. I am a survivor of armed assault and rape, random acts that happened shortly after I gave birth to my first son. A time of great fragility in a woman's life.</strong></div>
<p>◉ <i>Je suis auteure, compositrice et interprète. Je suis survivante d'une agression à main armée et de viol, un acte criminel aléatoir  arrivé peu de temps après avoir donné naissance à mon premier fils.  Une période de grande fragilité dans la vie d'une femme.</i></p>
<p><strong>For a long time, I tried to get by in life in silence.  Yet, the physical and psychological impacts the attack and rape had on me were massive. The lack of help deeply impaired me. Years later, PTSD and a severe depression struck.</strong><br/>◉ <i>Pendant de nombreuses années, je me suis débrouillée dans la vie en silence.  Pourtant, les impacts physiques et psychologiques de cette attaque et du viol étaient plus qu'importants.  Le manque d'aide m'affectant encore plus.  Ce qui devait arriver, est arrivé.  Des années plus tard une dépression et un stress post-traumatique me frappaient de plein fouet.</i></p>
<p><strong>I was broken and needed understanding and support.  Instead, I was stigmatized and abandonned with my own torments. I suffered tremendously. </strong><br/>◉ <i>J'étais brisée et avais besoin d'amour et de soutien autour de moi.  À la place, on m'a stigmatisé et abandonnée avec mes tourments. J'ai énormément souffert.</i></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OctAhrkyM_s?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Making the album goes beyond art-therapy. It is my own way to make a difference in the world of survivors. No one should live through revictimization like I did.  It is inhumane.  </strong><br/>◉ <i>Mon projet d’album est plus que de l’art-thérapie.  C’est ma manière de faire une différence dans le monde des survivants et de leurs proches. Personne ne devrait vivre de la revictimisation comme je l'ai vécu. C'est inhnumain.  </i></p>
<p><strong>I want to connect with victims and their families, give them comfort and offer them an avenue to begin healing.</strong><br/><i>◉Je souhaite donc établir un dialogue avec les victimes et leurs proches, les réconforter et leur proposer un début de guérison.</i></p>
<p><strong>Why the name Hippocampus Project?</strong><br/>◉ <i>Pourquoi nommer l'album « Le projet Hippocampe »? </i><br/><br/><strong>While researching on the web about trauma, I discovered the work of Dr. Muriel Salmona, a psychiatrist and activist from France, investing her career for the cause of victims of sexual violence.</strong><br/>◉ Lors de mes recherches à propos des traumatismes, j'ai découvert les travaux de la docteure Muriel Salmona, psychiatre et militante française, qui consacre sa carrière à la cause des victimes de violences sexuelles.<br/><br/><strong>I then learned about the existence of the hippocampus of the brain and its role in trauma and rape.   If the hippocampus allowed me to survive during the attacks,  it was now damaged and in part responsible for my PTSD.</strong><br/>◉ <i>J'ai ainsi découvert l'existence de l'hippocampe du cerveau et de son rôle dans les traumatismes et le viol. Si l'hippocampe m'a permis de survivre pendant l'attaque, elle est maintenant endommagée et en partie responsable de mon stress post-traumatique.</i></p>

</div></div>","Je crois que chaque vie est sacrée, que chaque personne mérite d'être respectée que  chaque personne devrait pouvoir vivre sa vie sans se faire briser, cependant, je sais que ce n'est pas toujours le cas. C’est pourquoi je veux faire un album de musique pour aider celles et ceux qui ont été blessés. Je veux communiquer avec leurs coeurs en leur offrant un début de guérison. Pourquoi? Parce que je suis une chanteuse, une compositrice, une interprète et une survivante de viol. Les surplus de la campagne, une partie de l'argent des ""perks"" (récompenses), comme les profits des ventes de l'album iront à une organisation soutenant les victimes d'agression sexuelle, les CALACS. 
I am a singer and a songwriter. I am a survivor of armed assault and rape, random acts that happened shortly after I gave birth to my first son. A time of great fragility in a woman's life.
◉ Je suis auteure, compositrice et interprète. Je suis survivante d'une agression à main armée et de viol, un acte criminel aléatoir  arrivé peu de temps après avoir donné naissance à mon premier fils.  Une période de grande fragilité dans la vie d'une femme.
For a long time, I tried to get by in life in silence.  Yet, the physical and psychological impacts the attack and rape had on me were massive. The lack of help deeply impaired me. Years later, PTSD and a severe depression struck.◉ Pendant de nombreuses années, je me suis débrouillée dans la vie en silence.  Pourtant, les impacts physiques et psychologiques de cette attaque et du viol étaient plus qu'importants.  Le manque d'aide m'affectant encore plus.  Ce qui devait arriver, est arrivé.  Des années plus tard une dépression et un stress post-traumatique me frappaient de plein fouet.
I was broken and needed understanding and support.  Instead, I was stigmatized and abandonned with my own torments. I suffered tremendously. ◉ J'étais brisée et avais besoin d'amour et de soutien autour de moi.  À la place, on m'a stigmatisé et abandonnée avec mes tourments. J'ai énormément souffert.

Making the album goes beyond art-therapy. It is my own way to make a difference in the world of survivors. No one should live through revictimization like I did.  It is inhumane.  ◉ Mon projet d’album est plus que de l’art-thérapie.  C’est ma manière de faire une différence dans le monde des survivants et de leurs proches. Personne ne devrait vivre de la revictimisation comme je l'ai vécu. C'est inhnumain.  
I want to connect with victims and their families, give them comfort and offer them an avenue to begin healing.◉Je souhaite donc établir un dialogue avec les victimes et leurs proches, les réconforter et leur proposer un début de guérison.
Why the name Hippocampus Project?◉ Pourquoi nommer l'album « Le projet Hippocampe »? While researching on the web about trauma, I discovered the work of Dr. Muriel Salmona, a psychiatrist and activist from France, investing her career for the cause of victims of sexual violence.◉ Lors de mes recherches à propos des traumatismes, j'ai découvert les travaux de la docteure Muriel Salmona, psychiatre et militante française, qui consacre sa carrière à la cause des victimes de violences sexuelles.I then learned about the existence of the hippocampus of the brain and its role in trauma and rape.   If the hippocampus allowed me to survive during the attacks,  it was now damaged and in part responsible for my PTSD.◉ J'ai ainsi découvert l'existence de l'hippocampe du cerveau et de son rôle dans les traumatismes et le viol. Si l'hippocampe m'a permis de survivre pendant l'attaque, elle est maintenant endommagée et en partie responsable de mon stress post-traumatique.
Do you know that the shape of the hippocampus of the brain resembles one of the seahorse? I didn't!◉ Saviez-vous que la forme de l'hippocampe du cerveau ressemble à celle du cheval de mer?Je ne le savais pas! 
Then, I started to draw lines between the life of the seehorse and the life of survivors.◉ J'ai ainsi commencé à tracer des lignes entre la vie de l'hippocampe et la vie des survivants.
My Metaphor was born.◉ Ma métaphore venait de naître.

The cause is so dear to me that I have chosen to give all campaign's surplus and all profits from sales to the non profit organisation in Quebec that helps and supports rape victims, CALACS.◉ La cause est si importante pour moi que j'ai décidé de faire le don de tous les excédents de la campagne et des profits des ventes à un organisme à but non lucratif venant en aide au victimes d'agressions sexuelles, CALACS.
Help me record the Hippocampus album, help me help others.  Let music be the media that will build bridges between victims and the rest of the world. ◉ Aidez-moi à enregistrer l'album Hippocampe, aidez-moi à aider les autres. Faisons ensemble que la musique puisse contribuer à créer des liens entre les victimes et le reste du monde.Together we can make a difference.◉ Ensemble, nous pouvons faire une différence.


What I Need & What You Get.◉ Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtenez.
The sums raised will be used to defray the costs of studio hours, production, mastering, graphic design and manufacturing of the album. Many other expenses will also be involved in the making of this album but with your help this project will see the day.◉ Les sommes amassées serviront à défrayer les coûts de studio, la réalisation, le mastering, le graphisme, l'impression de l'album. Beaucoup d'autres dépenses seront aussi impliquées dans la réalisation de cet album mais grâce à vous, ce projet pourra voir le jour.To reach my goal, I did put together really awesome perks, From simple downloads to house concerts!◉ En contrepartie, vous aurez le choix entre diverses récompenses, au simple téléchargement jusqu'au concert de salon! 
What if I get more money?◉ Qu'arrivera-til si les sommes receuillies dépassent l'objectif?
That's even better, it will be given directly to the non profit organisation which support and help victims of sexual assaults, CALACS. ◉ Ce serait extraordiaire car cet argent sera remis aux CALACS, un organisme à but non lucratif qui soutient et aide les victimes d'agression sexuelle.
What if I don't reach my goal?◉ Qu'arrivera-t-il si je n'atteinds pas mon objectif?
It won't stop me from moving forward and let you have your perks and profits from sales will still go to the non-profit organization surpporting sexual assault survivors.◉ Cela ne m'empêchera pas de continuer d'avancer avec le projet, de vous donner vos récompenses comme de remettre les profits des ventes aux Calacs, organisme qui vient en aide aux survivantes et survivants de violences et agressions à caractère sexuel.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Being able to effectively communicate is one of the most valuable skills a person can have. It allows you to express yourself, make meaningful connections, and find your soul’s purpose. These skills are especially difficult for children who have special learning needs. Adrienne Murphy, is hoping to change that. </p>
<p>Adrienne is not a Music Therapist. She is a Speech-Language Pathologist, which means she is an expert in many facets of communication including, speech sounds, social communication, cognitive communication, voice and more. Adrienne has incorporated music into her practice as a way to empower children and help them find their unique path.</p>
<p><strong>A portion of all future album sales will be donated to The Special Olympics and TACA (Talking About Curing Autism) </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>In addition to being a Speech-Language Pathologist, classically- trained vocalist and healing arts practitioner, Adrienne is also a mother to a special needs son. Adrienne’s journey with her son has proven to be the journey of her soul’s purpose. Using her unique combination of professional expertise, deep spirituality, and vocal abilities, Adrienne has been able to help not only her son, but countless children, discover their authentic voice. This key discovery allows children to better navigate their entry into the real world. </p>
<p>Now that Adrienne’s special needs son has discovered his creative-authentic self and thriving on his own in the world, she has been compelled to bring her one-of-a-kind songs of empowerment, love, acceptance and inclusion to the masses through her unique album.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES HEARTSONGS OF THE RAINBOW MEAN?</strong></p>
<p>            Heartsong means to “sing from the heart” , which is exactly what Adrienne has been doing in her mission for inclusion, acceptance, and love for everyone with special needs.</p>
<p>            Rainbow is used to illustrate that beauty that while we all may be different and many different colors, we are still one.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>Adrienne has partnered with <strong>The Brothers Koren</strong> (aka <i>The Kin</i>) to bring her album to life. The Brothers Koren, who was previously signed to Interscope / Universal Records, and toured with Coldplay, Pink and Rod Stewart, have now made it their mission to help artists, like Adrienne, with a heart for music to express their authentic selves, stories and values without the limitations of the mainstream music industry.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>This project will be a valuable resource to the world of children with disabilities and their parents. It will be used not only as a healing tool but also aims to uplift, inspire and transform while increasing awareness and education to the world at large about the struggles and challenges that this special population of children and their parents face. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Project</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Hello. My name is Zack Freitas, I'm a 26 year old singer-songwriter from Hollister, CA. I currently reside in Monterey working as a full-time musician. I've been playing music since I was 13 years old, and it's my life's purpose to write songs. I perform several nights every weekend, and you can usually find me busking (Street Performing) 3-5 days a week depending on the weather.</li>
<li>I have invested into a 5 song EP with my producer Dean Dichoso and members of Candlebox at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles. My goal is to get back in the studio and transform this EP into a full-length LP with 5 more songs in March. Here's the music video for the first single, ""Sweet Oblivion"". </li>
</ul>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ek_Ii3HpVS8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<ul><li>This project is so important to me because now is the perfect time for me to take a GIANT LEAP and push my music to break through to a wider audience, opening doors to be touring around the USA and EU. Here's a documentary on the recording of the first half of the record!</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRv5cSanmSg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>As an independent artist I still retain my creative rights, and I've never had quality professional recordings of this scale before.  There's potential for radio play or Commercial/Film/Spotify Playlist placement that could take my career to a whole new level. Who knows, I could be opening up for bigger artists or playing festivals within a year if I were to be so lucky. And I've been pretty lucky lately! Did I mention I met my producer on a video game?</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">My Goal &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>My goal is $10,000. It's $1,000 per day at EastWest Studios (We need 2 days). My producer charges $7,000 for the pre-production, recording, &amp; mixing of 5 songs. That leaves $1,000 for session musicians if I meet my goal. Any other funds leftover will go towards the session musicians, mastering the music, and touring.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548610704/t7jxaunmlq0ecazzsmma.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>I have a wide variety of neat perks to choose from. It could be a swag package of merchandise mailed to your door, a cover song of your choice on YouTube, or your very own private BBQ concert with Zack Freitas &amp; The Hired Guns!</li>
<li>Even if I don't reach my entire goal, I'm going to do everything within my power to turn this into a full length record.  It's a giant stepping stone for my career to be working at this level. In any case, funds left over will be invested into the promotional tour.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>This album is harboring the best material I have to offer. Not only sonically, but also conceptually as my songwriting has developed over the years. Songs like ""Someone Worth Saving"" &amp; ""Sunny Day"" speak to the heart with an honest recognition that the human condition is both beautiful &amp; flawed. I believe people around the world will find this music redeeming and will identify with it in their own way therefore making the world a better place.</li>
<li>I've chosen to be a full-time musician and have been so grateful for the support that people have given me wherever I go. It never ceases to amaze me when the power of music seizes a moment in time, and the energy of the space and people around me changes for the better. If music impacts you as much as me, then the ripples of this project are going to move you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">No Risk, No Reward</h3>
<ul><li>I'm an entrepreneur with a go-getter personality, and I have invested my own money into the first half of this album. I was once told that if I wish to break into the music industry, I must take a risk and go into debt at some point. I'm doing my best to overcome that hurdle without a record label, and fortunately things are looking good for 2019 already. I've been accepted into a local talent booking agency in Monterey that will secure more paid gigs that allows me to invest in my budding music career. No matter what, I'm going to keep giving everything I've got into writing great songs and sharing them with listeners around the world.</li></ul>

My goal is to get back in the studio and transform this EP into a full-length LP with 5 more songs in March. Here's the music video for the first single, ""Sweet Oblivion"". 


This project is so important to me because now is the perfect time for me to take a GIANT LEAP and push my music to break through to a wider audience, opening doors to be touring around the USA and EU. Here's a documentary on the recording of the first half of the record!
 

 
As an independent artist I still retain my creative rights, and I've never had quality professional recordings of this scale before.  There's potential for radio play or Commercial/Film/Spotify Playlist placement that could take my career to a whole new level. Who knows, I could be opening up for bigger artists or playing festivals within a year if I were to be so lucky. And I've been pretty lucky lately! Did I mention I met my producer on a video game?

My Goal & What You'll Get
 
My goal is $10,000. It's $1,000 per day at EastWest Studios (We need 2 days). My producer charges $7,000 for the pre-production, recording, & mixing of 5 songs. That leaves $1,000 for session musicians if I meet my goal. Any other funds leftover will go towards the session musicians, mastering the music, and touring.


I have a wide variety of neat perks to choose from. It could be a swag package of merchandise mailed to your door, a cover song of your choice on YouTube, or your very own private BBQ concert with Zack Freitas & The Hired Guns!
Even if I don't reach my entire goal, I'm going to do everything within my power to turn this into a full length record.  It's a giant stepping stone for my career to be working at this level. In any case, funds left over will be invested into the promotional tour.


The Impact
 

This album is harboring the best material I have to offer. Not only sonically, but also conceptually as my songwriting has developed over the years. Songs like ""Someone Worth Saving"" & ""Sunny Day"" speak to the heart with an honest recognition that the human condition is both beautiful & flawed. I believe people around the world will find this music redeeming and will identify with it in their own way therefore making the world a better place.
I've chosen to be a full-time musician and have been so grateful for the support that people have given me wherever I go. It never ceases to amaze me when the power of music seizes a moment in time, and the energy of the space and people around me changes for the better. If music impacts you as much as me, then the ripples of this project are going to move you.


No Risk, No Reward
I'm an entrepreneur with a go-getter personality, and I have invested my own money into the first half of this album. I was once told that if I wish to break into the music industry, I must take a risk and go into debt at some point. I'm doing my best to overcome that hurdle without a record label, and fortunately things are looking good for 2019 already. I've been accepted into a local talent booking agency in Monterey that will secure more paid gigs that allows me to invest in my budding music career. No matter what, I'm going to keep giving everything I've got into writing great songs and sharing them with listeners around the world.

<h3>The Dream Comes Alive</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Jahnel Daliya, a singer songwriter based in Northern Virginia. I have  been writing original songs for the past 5 years. I had no idea how the choice to pursue music and honing my songwriting skills would change my life. It took 32 years for me to realize that being a songwriter was my passion and now I want to inspire and encourage others through the music I write. Songs that make life's heaviness a little less heavy, songs that make you want to let loose and be free. Three years ago I put together a band of talented local musicians and since then we have been performing at music clubs, festivals and music conferences sharing my story and my songs.</p>
<p><strong>The passion has grown</strong>.I'm ready to dream bigger and to do that I need a your help. I've decided to put together this campaign to fund a big recording project. This will be my second time in the studio. I learned so much about the process of releasing music in 2017 when I put out a four track album. I knew that my next effort would need more funds in order to make it a successful release. I am recording eleven songs backed by a full band of some of the area's most talented musicians. The plan is to promote this album and share it beyond my hometown. Having this campaign fully funded would support the albums potential to reach a wider audience and creating more opportunities to connect with fans.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>More songs + talented musicians + an awesome and experienced recording engineer in one of the best studios in the area = one EXPENSIVE album. I am looking to raise $11,000 for this project. Contributions to this campaign will go towards:        </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Studio Time (Recording/Mixing)- </strong>We have started recording at Tonal Park Studio in Takoma Park Maryland. </li>
<li>
<strong>Paying Musicians- </strong>Talented people deserve to be payed for their craft and I've hired some of the best to make this record.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering- </strong>This process will have all the hard work we've put into the songs sounding their absolute best and ready for distribution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Printing CD's/ Graphic Design/ PR- </strong>Got to have physical merch for everyone to enjoy. I'll need to hire a graphic designer/artist for artwork. I'm also hiring a team to help spread the word and expand the reach.This record is so precious to me I want to celebrate it in a big way by offering T-shirts, Posters designed by local artists, CD's, Buttons and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Videos-</strong> If by some amazing chance I can surpass this goal I will be putting the rest of the funding towards creating videos for songs from the album.</li>

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p> When I started this journey I thought I was just trying to lead my family by the example of following my heart and love of music. What I found through performing were people who were really leaning in and connecting with the lyrics. I've been asked many times if a song was online or if I had any albums they could purchase and I felt like I was failing them for not having what they wanted or needed. I strive to keep it real and keep the tone positive through my lyrics while offering fun and sometimes intimate music that moves you. This is what you would be supporting to be released into the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Projects like this are time consuming, stressful and expensive however my passion burns strong and this is what I love and I will be giving it my all. Since the goal is to spread the music I want to have all the tools to connect with fans. Printing merchandise will probably take time depending on turn around time and any other issues that may arise with designs. I have already begun planning the material and lining up artist, but it is important to me to deliver every perk on time. I will be sure to keep everyone updated and informed on the progress of this project. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name's Kate Daisy Grant and I am a singer and songwriter from Brighton, UK.</p>
<p>I've been researching for the last few years the sounds of connection and the effect they have on us. This led me to playing folk lullabies, which in turn became an interest in how similar many of them are. Maybe it is an innate knowledge we all share in which patterns our babies will find soothing.</p>

<p>As the project is nearly complete, no risks are apparent at this time. Should any of the mastering or manufacturing processes take longer than expected and delay delivery time slightly, this would be communicated immediately to supporters. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name's Kate Daisy Grant and I am a singer and songwriter from Brighton, UK.
I've been researching for the last few years the sounds of connection and the effect they have on us. This led me to playing folk lullabies, which in turn became an interest in how similar many of them are. Maybe it is an innate knowledge we all share in which patterns our babies will find soothing.
I began to combine the tunes as harmonies to each other and blend each tune into the next. With the playing and production skills of Nick Pynn, we began to record many layers of lullabies with piano and string arrangement. This album is the result.
Your help will be invaluable to getting the album out there to the world in the final stages of mastering and CD production. 
What We Need & What You Get

Our needs are simple at this stage - your money will ensure that we can pay an engineer to master the album (the final stage of sound processing where everything really falls into place) and will pay for the CD manufacture.
As and when any excess funds are raised, we will donate 25% of these to the charities War Child and Honor The Earth. We will also be able to direct funds to marketing the album.
If we didn't reach our goal, we will put the money towards the mastering and CD production only.
You can choose between a high quality digital download of the album for £7 (which will be emailed to you on completion with a redemption code) or a CD and download copy for £10.
We expect that download codes will be sent out before Christmas and CDs will be posted as soon as manufacturing allows.

Risks & Challenges
As the project is nearly complete, no risks are apparent at this time. Should any of the mastering or manufacturing processes take longer than expected and delay delivery time slightly, this would be communicated immediately to supporters. 

Other Ways You Can Help

It follows a personal journey of love and loss and reclaiming core values and identity while celebrating the simple things in life.</p><p>In his own words, “It is a real blessing to birth this into the world. We are now mixing a whopping 21 song album. When most artists today have long forgotten about the art of making a full length album and instead focus on the “big hit”, to me there’s just so much more to say and share, then what a 3 minute pop song could ever possibly express. I invested my heart and soul into this creative endeavour along with every last ounce of savings I have, and now as the last drop of funds have completely run out, I need your help and support to make it to the finish line”.</p><p>Changing the world, One click at a time!Consider becoming a partner with me in this new project.

Shalom and Blessings           Since the summer Yerachmiel has been slaving away naked in the recording studio. Not literally of course because that would be just weird. But in his long awaited sixth studio album “Off The Derech”, he strips things down to the basics and it is certainly the most raw and real, and emotionally revealing one to date.This album uniquely combines the secular with the spiritual/religious and celebrates the idea of carving ones own path. It follows a personal journey of love and loss and reclaiming core values and identity while celebrating the simple things in life.In his own words, “It is a real blessing to birth this into the world. We are now mixing a whopping 21 song album. When most artists today have long forgotten about the art of making a full length album and instead focus on the “big hit”, to me there’s just so much more to say and share, then what a 3 minute pop song could ever possibly express. I invested my heart and soul into this creative endeavour along with every last ounce of savings I have, and now as the last drop of funds have completely run out, I need your help and support to make it to the finish line”.Changing the world, One click at a time!Consider becoming a partner with me in this new project. Check out some of the amazing perks offered for a limited time and share this with your friends and family!!!Two Great Emotions

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>We are Alex and the Dukes. Alex August is the vocalist and ukulele player. Lead guitar, Pasi Sipilä. Denis Prokopenko plays bass guitar and sings as well. The percussionists are Ioannis Peristianis and Tiki Friehs!</p>
<p>We make music! Big love music! We mainly focus around an acoustic reggae/indie folk vibe shedding light on themes such as unity, peace, acceptance and love with a twist of activism and social rebellion. Some songs also ask for the listener to dig deeper into their inner selves, by understanding the beauty of the human condition to unlock the core of their loving being.</p>
<p>We have played mainly in the Old City of Nicosia, the south and the north, taking part and performing events centralised around actively reforming unity into the currently separated communities on the island of Cyprus. Despite the serious undertone in the message, we have a very light-hearted approach in the delivery of our philosophies. It is, in the end of the day, all about having good fun and spreading good energy to bring the people together.</p>
<p>We are in the final stages of producing a debut 'live-ish' album which we are looking forward to releasing towards the end of this year. The project is being finalised by Pasi who is currently in Finland, working on the mix and master of the album.</p>
<p><strong>It is our biggest hope</strong> to share our music, through the album, with others in order to positively affect people's lives. We believe that we need more conscious positive music in our world that encourages people to be positively aware of themselves and the world around them and by doing so, be able to help change the world, little by little, towards a state where everyone in our community is happy and in touch with themselves.</p>
<p><strong>It would be so amazing and we would be so grateful </strong>if the community could help us spread this vision. With your help, we will be able to mix and master the album and share it with others, either through digital or hard copies. So far we, as a band, have done most of the work ourselves but we need some help to push this project out into the world. Our friends have helped us a lot with things such as recording locations and extra equipment. However, we would love to be able to contribute towards the hard work and efforts of all other creatives and artists who have generously involved themselves in our project. These amazing people deserve it!</p>

<li>We have a general budget of <strong>€1000</strong> towards the <strong>mix and master</strong> of the <strong>10 tracks</strong>.</li>
<li>Roughly <strong>€600 </strong>to pay all the other <strong>creatives and artists</strong> who are contributing to the project; Ediz, the <strong>website developer</strong>, Anna for the<strong> album art</strong>, Kate for the<strong> filming</strong> of the project.</li>
<li>Around <strong>€</strong><strong>500 </strong>towards the creation of <strong>hard copies of the album</strong> and<strong> distributing </strong>it; Spotify, YouTube, Amazon etc.,  </li>
<li>The <strong>extra </strong>will be used for packaging and posting. </li>

<p>‘’I wrote these songs in a time of great exploration of my inner world and my outer world.

The lyrics written range from politically or socially engaged to spiritually enchanting while also celebrating love, nature, humanity and the different flavours of life. Songwriting voiced my soul’s hopes and love for our world and it is my greatest wish that the album created by Alex &amp; the Dukes will ripple the same effect to others. I would love for others to dive into our music and find their true selves in it because I believe we need more authenticity in this world and more people in touch with themselves in order to actively create some positive change in our planet in this day and age. It is also just a great gift and such fun to see smiles and be with everyone together feeling connected and happy and part of a community when we play music for people. There’s so much love that can go around.’’ – Alex</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Thank you for landing on this page for whatever reason, I hope it wasn't just the AWESOME pictures haha... but even then<br/>I'm honored to be able to share a few words with you. <br/>If you have time I'd strongly suggest watching the video not just because it's informative but because I'm HILARIOUS!<br/>Anyways..<br/><strong>IN A NUTSHELL </strong><br/>As some of you know, this campaign is a fundraising or better say a more personalized way for you to buy our debut record ""Where the Mermaids Are"". The record is inspired by my many stories as an Iranian American woman born and raised in Iran. This album is basically a dream come true and all I ever wanted to do as an indie musician in Iran so here it is!! With all that said though the purpose of this record is much more, at least thats what I like to think.</p>
<p>You see as an immigrant, a generation zero immigrant or generally anybody who is living in a different location than their up bringing, you go through stories and events in your life that are indescribable. They're the most intense, beautiful , sad, happy and all and all unique things that could happen to a person. From cultural clashes to language barriers to heart break to homesickness, this record represents what it means to be a multi cultured person in the current world. I know many of you no matter what your ethnicity, have experienced some of the same things I have gone through so It's almost like somebody who was born in the other side of the world is writing songs out loud based on what YOU are feeling too and that my friend is the most beautiful connection music can make! Look, we're living in a real challenging time right now. You and I both know that the world is going towards connection! Cultures are mixing up and people from all over the world have the chance to meet each other and get to know each other as humans no matter what their <strong>RACE</strong>, <strong>GENDER</strong> or <strong>COUNTRY OF CITIZENSHIP</strong> is! And thats how it should be! if anyone ever said peace isn't a good thing, they're a BAD person and thats just common sense. Interestingly enough though thats what the world has come to, people want to mix it up but there are some BAD people that feel frightened by the idea of a unified world. It's our job to represent what we want our world to be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I, personally want to eventually live in a world that when I say I was born in Iran people don't take a step back all whilst looking horrified and confused. I want to live in a world where the color of our skin isn't determining if we're worth living! I want to live in a world where I don't get ""selected by chance"" at the airport for extra monitoring literally EVERY TIME I'm at an airport! I want to live in a world where all of us can be who we want to be and love whom we want to love! I'm proud to say who I am. I love the fact that I'm an IRANIAN AMERICAN WOMAN! I love my Persian culture, I love my American culture and damn it I love being a WOMAN! and ""Where the Mermaids Are"" represents all of that and don't get me wrong there is also some silly love songs on the record! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Stylistically</strong> this record is mystical! I grew up as a rock musician, studied jazz in college and went back to my Persian roots a few years ago so you can imagine that this album is all that mixed and balanced in the form of music, I like to call it Soul Fusion with a hint of Persian Spice! but thats not all.. the most important thing about this album is that I got to feature and work with some of my favorite human beings on this planet all of whom have different cultural backgrounds. <strong>If you want to support diversity you need to present diversity and thats what we did!</strong> We're featuring musicians from anywhere from Brazil to Greece to China to Switzerland to Iran so go figure..I'm hoping that this album opens the door to many more culturally involved projects from myself and my fellow colleagues and I also hope that you can join us in this journey and also support anybody else with similar projects and slowly together we can work towards blurring the lines of race by presenting more intercultural arts to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Well.. we need money .. to continue..making art!</p>
<p>What you get is a truly unique experience or item of your choice as well as involvement in our future projects as much as you're comfortable with. This is not just about me(the creator) making something for you(the audience). It's really about you and I coming together and slowly growing the circle of unity! </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</strong></p>
<p>Look I know that damn college life and what it means to live with $2 in your pocket, if you can't financially contribute it doesn't mean that you can't join the journey at all! I urge you to please share this campaign with as many people as possible and I'd still love to take your hand and bring you to my world no matter how much cash you got, you're a FRIEND!Cheers to a better world; one with all colors, all spices and all love in peace!</p>

We're featuring musicians from anywhere from Brazil to Greece to China to Switzerland to Iran so go figure..I'm hoping that this album opens the door to many more culturally involved projects from myself and my fellow colleagues and I also hope that you can join us in this journey and also support anybody else with similar projects and slowly together we can work towards blurring the lines of race by presenting more intercultural arts to the world.

What We Need & What You Get
Well.. we need money .. to continue..making art!
What you get is a truly unique experience or item of your choice as well as involvement in our future projects as much as you're comfortable with. This is not just about me(the creator) making something for you(the audience). It's really about you and I coming together and slowly growing the circle of unity! 

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Look I know that damn college life and what it means to live with $2 in your pocket, if you can't financially contribute it doesn't mean that you can't join the journey at all! I urge you to please share this campaign with as many people as possible and I'd still love to take your hand and bring you to my world no matter how much cash you got, you're a FRIEND!Cheers to a better world; one with all colors, all spices and all love in peace!

<p>My name is Domanique Grant and I am an Indie- pop Singer/ songwriter and award-winning artist from Toronto, with a bit of an uncommon story… but I’ll start with what I am asking for your help with.  This year I will be releasing my debut EP Album PLAYHOUSE in October 2017.  This long-awaited album has inspired a 5,000 square-foot interactive experience that will be featured in Nuit Blanche Toronto, so that all of my fan's can experience it.  I need the help of fans, community leaders, artists, and fellow visionaries to help this dream, 5 years in the making become a reality!</p>
<p>I grew up in a historical housing co-operative in downtown Toronto, surrounded by music and interactive theatre spaces that helped me get my start in writing music, but also informed a love for creating live shows and imagining music in new ways. I have always been a community leader, as I became the youngest ever president of this neighbourhood, lived in between 3 continents before the age of 22, became an ambassador for over 47 countries for Canada's largest ever sporting games, and decided to write a music album because one day I woke up and couldn't define what the meaning of ""Home"" was, nor could any of my friends.<br/><br/>My debut music album PLAYHOUSE which explores experiences that shape the meaning of home in large cities, however, I want to give my fans the opportunity to experience my music album in a completely interactive experience assessable to all! This fully interactive exhibit can be experienced through touch, sound, and stunning visual displays.  Not only is this a feast for the senses, but it also allows individuals living with vision and hearing problems to experience PLAYHOUSE. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After nearly two decades in the business in various bands and projects.We have decided to take matters into our own hands and want to raise money for our new album directly from the people who have supported our bands all these years. After a somewhat long period in hibernation Essence of sorrow is finally back in business! This campaign is a way that supporters of a band can know exactly where their hard earned dollars are going. Cutting off the middlemen and keeping it between us (the band) and you our fan.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is a vital piece in the financing of these albums. It will be a great way for the people involved in the production to keep in touch with the audience and fans of Essence of sorrow. </p>
<p>Your contribution and support will enable us to expand this amazing project by adding production value. Funds will go directly to production like recording,mixing and mastering of both albums, and printing costs. Contributions by supporters like yourself, will also have a strong effect for the remaining financing of the total production budget plus additions. (possible merchandise, video(s),vinyl) </p>
<p>A great part of crowdfunding, is the possibility of giving something back immediately. We promise you frequent updates, feedback, photos and videos from the process, and last but not least; some great rewards based on your generosity! Hopefully you will find a perk appealing to you...If there´s something you´d want but are not available here. Mail us quickly with your request and we´ll see what we can do about it!</p>
<p>Our goal is 20 000€ <i>(before taxes) </i>to cover the costs for both albums. You can still choose which album you want to invest in or if you want to invest in both, with some cool bundles of course. The campaign is set as (flexible) which means if our goal is not reached we have to come up with a new strategy with the money received. <br/><br/>Making a top notch record comes at a price and we´re quite confident you´ll be as excited as we are about the new material.  Stay tuned for more revealing videos along the process!<br/><br/>So here´s your options.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While creating this E.P. I have struggled severely with anxiety &amp; depression after being raped on my birthday last year. I have used music as a way to release and heal from that trauma and in turn have worked to help the youth in our city struggling with the same traumatic situations. It is my hope that by releasing the music that saved me from suicide, I will help to save others. Music is healing &amp; ever powerful. As musicians, we have the power to make a change. It is my goal to continue to give back to others in the only way that I know how: with music.</p>

Soon, those quiet sessions turned into loud and celebratory ones, but were still quite inarticulate. After we were joined by a third guy, Javor, who was way more gifted than us (but stayed with us for a very short period), our sound experiments became more coherent and the contours of what we now call our sound started to show.</p><p>The essence of this sound were all the musical influences that'd inspired us, from kraut rock to world music, new wave, cartoon music, noise, avant-gard pop or outsider electronic music, as well as forest  sounds and various noises.</p><p>We've recorded a total of four albums (Lov na vile 1993, Safari 1995, Baba spava 2000, Ronioci 2003) and back when the live music scene in Croatia was at an all-time-low, we played shows all over the place (Croatia, UK, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Serbia, Slovenia etc).</p><p>Our friends and critics said this about us: ""Šumski are one of the truest and most eccentric Croatian underground bands, managing to swim against the current and make music that combines modern and traditional, experimental and conventional elements. Covering an area from experimental minimalism to innovative pop songs, Šumski have always had an aura of freshness and good vibes around them.""</p><p>We didn't really care about all that, so we did what even the best ones do – we broke up!</p><p>However, after a few years of not being a band, we decided to spring back into action, older and wiser. Alongside Kornel Šeper, Viktor Krasnić and Marin Juraga, the new, extended lineup was joined by Franjo Glušac (Peach Pit, Brujači, Franz Kafka Ensemble, Cul De Sac) on the guitar and Igor Pavlica (Haustor, Jinx, Cul De Sac…) on the trumpet.</p><p>We're currently recording new material and we think it's our best yet! Also, we concluded that such great material deserves a more ambitious release format – vinyl. We are recording in the Sunday Studio under the watchful eye of recording engineer Sven Pavlović.</p><p>The album, “Ostrvo ledenog kita” (Icy Whale Island), will contain 10 songs of our trademark ""forest“ sound, a colorful mix of the aforementioned influences - afro, kraut, new wave, avant-pop, prog-rock, music from Czech cartoons and so on... It will be released by Geenger Records and Zvuk Močvare.</p><p>The record sleeve will feature awesome illustrations by Tea Jurišić, a young artist, which means that our tradition of hand-illustrated record covers lives on – the covers of our previous two records were illustrated by cult artist Igor Hofbauer.</p><p>How can one help us, you may ask? Well, by participating in this crowdfunding campaign, of course!</p><p>We started this campaign because, although we've secured a major part of the funds, we're still $3500 short to wrap this whole thing up. In return, we'll give you our new album on vinyl, as well as some other perks listed to the right of this paragraph.</p><p>Listen to that sound - Šumski!</p><p>P.S.

Uz Kornela Šepera, Viktora Krasnića i Marina Juragu, u novoj proširenoj postavi s nama su gitarist Franjo Glušac (Peach Pit, Brujači, Franz Kafka Ensemble, Cul De Sac) i trubač Igor Pavlica (Haustor, Jinx, Cul De Sac…).Trenutno u studiju snimamo novi materijal, po našem skromnom mišljenju najbolji do sada! Zaključujemo da je takav materijal zaslužio i ambicioznije izdanje - format vinilne ploče.Za snimanje albuma izabrali smo odličan Sunday Studios u Svetoj Nedelji i producenta Svena Pavlovića.Album naslova “Ostrvo ledenog kita” sastojat će se od 10 pjesama našeg prepoznatljivog “šumskog” zvuka, kao šareni kolaž već spomenutih raznorodnih glazbenih utjecaja - afro, kraut, new wave, avant-pop, prog-rock, glazba iz animiranih filmova češke proizvodnje, itd... Objavit će ga stari lisci Geenger Records i Zvuk Močvare.Album će biti opremljen sjajnim ilustracijama mlade umjetnice Tee Jurišić, čime nastavljamo tradiciju ručno ilustriranih omota naših albuma (omote dva prethodna radio je kultni umjetnik Igor Hofbauer).Kako nam možeš pomoći, pitaš se? Sudjelovanjem u ovoj crowdfunding kampanji! Pokrenuli smo je jer nam, unatoč dijelu sredstava koje smo uložili u produkciju albuma, nedostaje još $3500 da cijeli projekt i završimo. Zauzvrat, osigurali smo ti naš novi album na vinilu i još nekoliko nagrada pobrojanih s desne strane ovog teksta.Slušaj taj zvuk - Šumski!P.S. Prati nas na Facebooku za sve novosti! ***For you, our supporter from abroad.***Back in 1991, just as we (Kornel and Jura) were starting our studies, we decided to spice up the time spent together with casual music sessions on out-of-tune acoustic guitars. Soon, those quiet sessions turned into loud and celebratory ones, but were still quite inarticulate. After we were joined by a third guy, Javor, who was way more gifted than us (but stayed with us for a very short period), our sound experiments became more coherent and the contours of what we now call our sound started to show.The essence of this sound were all the musical influences that'd inspired us, from kraut rock to world music, new wave, cartoon music, noise, avant-gard pop or outsider electronic music, as well as forest  sounds and various noises.We've recorded a total of four albums (Lov na vile 1993, Safari 1995, Baba spava 2000, Ronioci 2003) and back when the live music scene in Croatia was at an all-time-low, we played shows all over the place (Croatia, UK, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Serbia, Slovenia etc).Our friends and critics said this about us: ""Šumski are one of the truest and most eccentric Croatian underground bands, managing to swim against the current and make music that combines modern and traditional, experimental and conventional elements. Covering an area from experimental minimalism to innovative pop songs, Šumski have always had an aura of freshness and good vibes around them.""We didn't really care about all that, so we did what even the best ones do – we broke up!However, after a few years of not being a band, we decided to spring back into action, older and wiser. Alongside Kornel Šeper, Viktor Krasnić and Marin Juraga, the new, extended lineup was joined by Franjo Glušac (Peach Pit, Brujači, Franz Kafka Ensemble, Cul De Sac) on the guitar and Igor Pavlica (Haustor, Jinx, Cul De Sac…) on the trumpet.We're currently recording new material and we think it's our best yet! Also, we concluded that such great material deserves a more ambitious release format – vinyl. We are recording in the Sunday Studio under the watchful eye of recording engineer Sven Pavlović.The album, “Ostrvo ledenog kita” (Icy Whale Island), will contain 10 songs of our trademark ""forest“ sound, a colorful mix of the aforementioned influences - afro, kraut, new wave, avant-pop, prog-rock, music from Czech cartoons and so on... It will be released by Geenger Records and Zvuk Močvare.The record sleeve will feature awesome illustrations by Tea Jurišić, a young artist, which means that our tradition of hand-illustrated record covers lives on – the covers of our previous two records were illustrated by cult artist Igor Hofbauer.How can one help us, you may ask? Well, by participating in this crowdfunding campaign, of course!We started this campaign because, although we've secured a major part of the funds, we're still $3500 short to wrap this whole thing up. In return, we'll give you our new album on vinyl, as well as some other perks listed to the right of this paragraph.Listen to that sound - Šumski!P.S.

<h3>""United We Stand:"" The Story Behind the Concert </h3>
</div><div>
<p>On January 28th 2017, I drove nearly an hour to meet with Nina Alvarez, an editor and media outreach consultant in Rochester, NY. She was going to<strong> help me launch my first crowdsourcing campaign</strong> to raise money for an album  I had wanted to record for the last 9 years. I should have been excited, but deep down I felt so unsettled. Our country was full of political unrest and the government's first attempt at a travel ban. My plans for my album were going to be put on the ""back burner"" for a while. I knew the campaign was meant for something much bigger than myself.</p>
<p><strong>It was devastating and paralyzing</strong> to hear stories of children being brutally murdered in the streets, families being torn apart, and forced to flee from their homes with whatever they could carry. I could not fathom how anyone can be so cruel. I wanted to jump on the next plane and rescue all the innocent people. Being a mother of two young children, I knew that was not an option. But I was compelled to find my purpose to help this situation.</p>
<p>Praying for inspiration and guidance from the Blessed Mother (to whom I'm devoted) I finally had the answer. In a vision I saw people of different nationalities dancing and singing with each other in a circle unified. In that moment the ""United with Music Benefit Concert"" was created. <strong>I knew I was meant to bring a community together with the uplifting, healing energy of music</strong>, and to have musicians of different nationalities representing cultures from around the world be the energy of unity, and an example to the world that we all can live together in peace. </p>
<p>What better way for me to give back then to use my 25 years experience with multi-media productions and music performance to make the world a better place. Just like ""The Little Drummer Boy,"" <strong>music is the gift I can give</strong>. For many years I kept hearing spirit say ""Build it and they will come."" I did not know what ""it"" was or who ""they"" were, then suddenly it all made sense.</p>
<p><strong>On February 3, 2017 I went to a rally for refugees</strong> in Rochester, NY with my like-minded new friends Tracy Cretelle, and Nina Alvarez. It was 18 degrees Fahrenheit and my fingers were so cold I could barely feel them, but I did not care. It was not about me. In that moment I saw the beauty of camaraderie and solidarity. A sweet Muslim gentleman, who was providing tea to as many cold people as he could, handed me a cup of delicious tea. Not only did it warm my body but it warmed my soul. I saw a rainbow of people from different races, and religions gathered together to support each other.  It gave me the energy and enthusiasm I needed to start working on ""United with Music.""</p>
<div>
<strong>Because a brave seven-year old girl named Bana Alabed,</strong> from Aleppo, Syria, shared her story, I was awakened to the reality of the terror, sadness, and loss she and many other children were suffering.  It just horrified me to think of my own children having to go through this.  It was then that I knew the main focus of the concert should be raising money for refugees. Bana documented her story through twitter, and captured the world's attention, while being trapped between the Syrian regime and opposition militias, and finally making her escape to Turkey with her family. Luckily they did not end up in a refugee camp. Her memoir <i>Dear World</i> is being published by Simon and Schuster.  I know she will inspire many more people.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>At first I did not know what non-profit organization</strong> would benefit from this concert. I wanted the money to be able to help refugees locally.  Then I heard about ""Refugees Helping Refugees"" from Tracy Cretelle. When I researched RHR I discovered what a significant role they play in the lives of so many refugees. Their help is needed more than ever now that refugees only receive 30 days assistance from the government, I knew this is where the money needed to go.</p>
<p>It's important to acknowledge that it takes a team to accomplish great things, and the right people will arrive just when you need them. My heart is warmed by how people have shown interest and great compassion towards this project. I am grateful to my husband, Mark Shannon, for working full time and then coming home to help with household duties and care taking so I can put in the time to ""United with Music"" to ensure it's success. I stay motivated and energized by my friends Tracy Cretelle, and Nina Alvarez, who are volunteering their time to organize and promote the concert.</p>
<p>I have seen real beauty and caring in people like Pastor Doug and the staff at The Lutheran Church of the Incarnate Word, who have donated the church space for the concert, the musicians who have volunteered their time or have reduced their fee to perform, and to all the people who are and continue to volunteer, donate, attend the concert, and spread the word. </p>

Members of the band come from all backgrounds but what we have in common is a love of the music.Cody Dollins fronts the band, singing and playing acoustic guitar. He is also a professional bull rider and goes to school at Tarleton State University, we often call him the 'Golden Child'.Weston Dodd plays lead guitar and has no idea how he ended up in a country band. He is not as accomplished as his brother Cody but somehow managed to father a beautiful little girl.Will Prescher plays rhythm guitar and we call him 'grizzly'. Not because he is large and burly and beardy, but because he was actually raised by grizzlies. He's also a scientist. Conducts experiments with his bear hands.Ben Bruton holds down the low end on bass guitar, you could say he brings the beef. Also, although he is the second youngest member of the band, he most definitely looks the oldest... bad genes I suppose. So it goes.Chris Smith brings the thunder, and he plays the drums too. He keeps everyone in line and on time. We're also pretty sure he's found the fountain of youth.  The way this gnarly group came together, well.. it could only be fate.

<p>What's this all about?</p>
<p>Hi guys. Thanks so much for your interest in my first EP.</p>
<p>I'm Chelsea Takami, a singer/songwriter from Long Island. I've been passionate about writing and performing music my entire life. I started on piano and flute when I was around 4 years old, but it wasn't until I picked up a guitar at the age of 14 that I felt I truly found my calling.</p>
<p>This EP has been a long time in the making. Some of my songs are 10 years old (some older!) and it's only now that I feel I am 100% ready to take this next step. I wanted to make sure I could produce the BEST quality album possible. And now that I'm ready, I won't be able to do this without you guys, so I'm calling on you to help me make my dreams come true!</p>
<p>Over the past year since I made the switch to performing full-time, I've grown in ways I never would have imagined were possible. My voice and guitar chops have become much stronger, I've gained confidence in myself, and there is a fire in my heart that drives me to succeed every day. I love waking up, I love the way my life is unfolding, and I feel like I am finally fulfilling my purpose. But why is all of this happening?</p>
<p>The reason is you. Your support, time, generosity, and love  has absolutely changed my life. You have truly opened my eyes to the beauty of humanity, and now I know for certain that my path and meaning in life is to create, perform, and share music to connect with you and make your lives better, just like you've done for me. Your support is everything!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I Need &amp; Why I Need It:</p>
<p>I need to raise $20,000 to cover the cost of the project. This money will be used to cover:</p>
<p>Studio Time: the producer, engineer, studio musicians, mixing, and mastering. The album is being produced at Cove City Sound Studios in Glen Cove. Cove City has worked with many successful artists, and celebrities like Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, JLo, and Jon Bellion. Richie Cannata, the owner of CCSS (the Saxophonist on Billy Joel's classic albums) has sold over 150 million albums. The quality of their work is top-tier. I visited many studios, and as soon as I set foot in CCSS and spoke with Richie, I knew this was the one I wanted to use.</p>
<p>Album Artwork: photographer, artist, graphic design.</p>
<p>Camera Crew and Video Production: I plan on making at least one official music video and also want to include behind-the-scenes footage to document and share this milestone in my career.</p>
<p>Production and Distribution of the EP: Creating actual physical copies of the album as well as making it available to stream and download online on iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, etc.</p>
<p>Marketing and PR: Hiring a publicist to facilitate coverage in music blogs, magazines, etc., social media outreach, and website design.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>As with any major project, there will of course be risks and challenges. I want to be transparent with you, so I'm going to go over some of these projected risks and how I plan on overcoming the obstacles.</p>
<p>What if I don't raise enough money? If I don't raise enough money, the project won't be the best it can be. I'd have to cut corners, it would be a mess, and I would be upset. I believe the key to preventing this is prior research on similar campaigns, excellent marketing, prepping the public, and keeping my supporters well informed. Also, offering excellent perks and ""thank-you"" gifts to all you amazing contributors, and making sure you know how appreciated you are and that you are a HUGE part of this entire process.</p>
<p>Will the album be profitable? Of course there is always a risk that any project could be a total flop, but once again I truly believe that the key to overcoming this is in the preparation. So here are some of the ways I've prepared:</p>
<p>Before I created this campaign, I paid for a consultation with esteemed producer Matty Amendola, who has a ton of experience in running similar successful campaigns, and he helped me tremendously with my expectations and plans on running my own.</p>
<p>There's a reason that almost half of the funds raised will be going towards professional marketing -- hiring the right team to reach the target audience, gain more fans, and spread the word will catapult the success rate of this EP and launch my career to the next level.</p>
<p>Lack of song material, organization, etc: Not an issue here, on any account. I have hours of material, which actually makes it a bit more of a challenge when it comes to choosing which songs to put on the EP. But luckily, I've hired one of the best teams in one of the best studios on Long Island to help me with picking and arranging songs, and believe me, they're doing an amazing job.</p>
<p>Why should you invest in my project? I've always been able to achieve success at any challenge I've put my mind to. I graduated High School top 10% in my grade (winning ""Best Musician"" in the yearbook superlatives - gotta prove them right!), then graduated college (Bachelor's of Art in Music Performance and Composition!) in 3 years with a GPA of 3.89 and an award in music. After making the decision to pursue a life of music, it took me less than a year to be able to fully support myself financially by only performing. I gig an average of 6 times a week and I love every moment of it. It all came through hard work and focus. I know that I have what it takes to make this album a success in every way because I am putting all of my energy and focus into doing so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>If you really want to help but are unable to contribute financially, that's okay! Here's what you can do:</p>
<p>MAKE SOME NOISE!! Spread the word to all your friends and family and shout me out on social media! Tell the world about my project! </p>
<p>I love you guys so much and I thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for your love and support!</p>

<h3>Where Does Your Pledge Go?</h3>

<li>If we make it to $14,000, we’ll release the album on sweet colored vinyl too! It’s pricey, but we want it to be an option. If we hit this goal, there’ll be an option to upgrade/swap out the CDs if you’d like.

<p>We are ABNDN. We're a pop duo of singer/songwriter, Alex Foreman and producer, Tim Evans. We've just finished producing our debut EP, ""Breakaway"". We've been working on it for well over 12 months, producing a sound that is unique with song that have meaning. Now that it's finished, we're super proud of how it sounds.</p>
<p>However, there are further things to take into account that will take this EP from the laptop in the studio into the publics hands... the long-short of it is that we need funds.</p>
<p>Here's where this campaign comes into play. We wanted to create a way that we could receive financial support without it being a charity. This campaign proves to do that. With each amount that you pledge, you are essentially pre-ordering the EP, as well as other merch. That way, you are investing in something that will end up in your hands.</p>
<p>There is a diverse range of pledge levels ranging from entry-level pledges that get a physical copy of the CD delivered to you, all the way up to high-level sponsorship pledges that get your name written into the ""thank-you's"" on the physical release of the CD as a contributor.</p>
<p>This is a dream of ours that is so close to being a reality, but the reality of the situation is that we need funds to do so. We're calling on you guys to help us make it happen and we truly value anything that you can contribute, and we know that, in turn, you will be greatly blessed by our record.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set our goal for $7,500. Thankfully, being a songwriter/producer duo, much of the production cost of creating a record of this standard has already been covered (i.e. studio time, mixing, mastering, ect.) What we're left with is everything else that comes along with releasing a record. This $7,500 will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design work</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Printing</li>
<li>Shipping</li>
<li>Framework media production</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Creative contributions</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Digital distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>A large portion of the funds is directly relative to producing the physical items that you pre-order through this campaign; the remaining funds cover the other areas of production as well creating a small amount of revenue to help continue the production of future releases (which we already have some stuff in mind).</p>
<p>Here's an overview of some of the things you'll be able to pre-order through this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical CD</li>
<li>Posters</li>
<li>Signed copies of the CD</li>
<li>Limited 10"" Transparent Vinyl</li>
<li>T-shirts</li>
<li>Sponsorship recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>If for any reason we do not reach our goal, we will still endeavour to get what you pre-order in production. We've established a solid framework of working with ""small-run"" companies, so we will be able to produce what is required... but we hope to meet our goal</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're young musicians with a dream, but we're convinced that we have the goods. What you contribute is not about us making a living, but rather, it's making dreams and passions become a reality. We know that we have many people that believe in us and believe in the content that we produce... we just want to make it real.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Financially, as it is with many artists... it's a tough road. We both work casual jobs and odd jobs here and there to self-fund our music passions as best we can. It's what we pour our lives into, because it's what we do best. The reality is, that it's the music industry, and it's a hard industry to make it in. Although we're confident in what we can bring, the horizons of the music industry are always a bit unsure... but with this campaign, at least we've got a shot. We're in it for the long haul, no matter what it looks like.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not in a position to be able to give financially, there are definitely other ways you can help. A huge element to the success of an artist in this day and age is through social networking. Give our Facebook page a like. Follow us on Instagram. Share our pre-order campaign and encourage people to get involved. No ""like"" goes unnoticed. Sometimes, a ""like"" is enough affirmation to keep us dreaming and keep us creating.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Eugene, and I am a composer and drummer based in New York City with a huge passion for jazz and original music. I'm currently finishing my Masters of Music in Jazz Studies at Queens College's Aaron Copland School of Music, one step closer to my dream of the highest musical heights after my graduation from Berklee College of Music. Over the years, I've received numerous accolades such as the ""Duke Ellington"" and ""Benny Golson"" Awards for my compositional skill and the ""Steve Gadd"" Award for my performance skill.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I've had the honor of sharing the stage with some of the world’s most celebrated jazz musicians such as Orlando Le Fleming, Samuel Torres, and Terence Blanchard among others. I've also been lucky enough to study with musical greats such as Gary Burton, Bill Charlap, Greg Hopkins and Mark Walker.<br/><br/>Last year, I managed to fund and independently produce my debut album "" A Blueprint for Tomorrow"" with the help of my numerous backers via Indiegogo. As time passes, musicians grow and I am no different; I have so much new music to share, but once again, I really need your help to produce my new album: ""Origin Story""!<br/><br/>I have a dream to become a world class musician and educator, and this is a starting point for me. With this album, I would be able to share not only the enjoyment I get out of music, but also my approach to drumming and composition. This album (with your help!) would potentially endure the test of time and serve to be a lasting showcase of my methodology.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any musician would know that producing an album is no mean feat. The manpower and logistics involved can be staggering! Artists have to worry about musician costs, studio costs, engineer costs, artwork... the list goes on. Furthermore, as a self-produced artist with no label, the economies of scale are against me and access to the aforementioned amenities are self-sourced and usually more expensive.<br/><br/>A conservative estimate puts my musician costs, studio costs, engineering costs and logistical costs of releasing the album at upwards of $4000USD. I've managed to scrape together some money, but it gets hard as a full-time student to meet the full amount.<br/><br/>So please help me realize my dreams and contribute to this project! You may ""pre-order"" the album through this platform, and depending on your decision, also receive some of my other music. As an educator, I am also offering lessons in drumming, composition or arranging. Furthermore, my arranging/composition expertise is also up for grabs at a discounted price; check out the Perks for your options!<br/><br/>Every little bit helps! Please consider contributing as little as $10 for the digital download of my upcoming album, ""Origin Story""!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned, I have a dream of becoming a world-class musician and educator and wish to contribute to society by being as learned in the 3 main aspects of music (in my opinion) as possible: the Theoretical, the Practical and the Sociological.<br/><br/>However, I cannot do this alone. I need to produce music and put it out there to make a difference.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>And so, please contribute in whatever way you can, and I will be eternally grateful and perhaps we could both benefit from this shared endeavor.</p>
<p>Even if money is tight for you, I would appreciate if you use the Indiegogo share tools and get the word out - make some noise on my behalf?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading, and I hope our paths do cross and you allow me the opportunity to share my music with you!</p>

<h3>Kratka povijest sranja</h3>
<p>disclaimer: Odvratno sam skriboman, tak da por favor, imajte strpljenja pročitat ove pizdarije. </p>
<p>Ajmo proć polako pizdarije koje su dovele do ovog projekta koji se upravo događa. Još kao klinac sam iznimno volio glazbu, što je učinilo da nakon kaj sam našao pradedinu klasičnu gitaru, poželim svirat gitaru. Skoro sam završio osnovnu muzičku za klasičnu gitaru, al onda su me starci odvukli u Đurđevac. Tamo sam kurac svirao gitaru, ali sam krajem srednje škole napravio bend imena Eto Zvuk (i dalje najbolje ime) u kojem sam svirao bubanj jer nitko drugi nije htio bit šupak na bubnju. Nakon povratka u zg sam svirao u bendu Notime Toulouse koji je fakat mogao bit jeben da svi nismo bili retardirani, pa sam snimio album sa Stampedom (Tandara Mandara 1998.), onda Massimom (Massimo 2002.), pa svirao sa Saneom, snimio live album sa Pips, Chips and Videoclips (Dokument 2004.), pa snažno gažerski svirao s Lanom Jurčević i Lukom Nižetićem (iako je bila super zajebancija) i snimio dva albuma sa Saneom (Do not cover 2012. i About Time 2014.).  Sve te godine sam malo svirao, malo pjevao, malo bio pijan ko sotona i odustajao od svega radi okolnosti ili karaktera, ne znam. 2006. sam dobio i dvije stipendije za faksove u londonu (vokal i bubanj), ali sam si mogao podanfat karu, jer nisam imao ni za kartu do Dugog Sela, a kamoli do Londona. </p>
<p>Sve te godine sam nerijetko bio vrlo pijan i razočaran u činjenicu da se nemreš u hr bavit glazbom ak sa strane ne radiš neki najgluplji posao ikad i to za malo love. To je činjenica. I onda sam pijano bičao po blogu il forumu jer kaj ćeš drugo radit kad si u usranoj situaciji. Nikaj. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2009., kad sam imao mrvu bolju situaciju i mogao sam sjest i počet snimat kak treba sam napisao i snimio 10 pjesama na hrvatskom u demo kvaliteti i iako sam ja mislio da su pjesme dobre, nitko od izdavača me nije jebao pol posto. Mislim da me ne bi jebali ni danas, jer će radije brijat na Festival Melodije Dijamantnog Pimpeka Ulješure u Škrbovićima, nego poslušat ikaj kaj zvuči drugačije. A kamoli izdat. U tom razdoblju se i Sane reaktivirao, pa sam prebacio sav fokus na to i radio isključivo to. I živio od mjuze, po prvi put u životu. I bio jako pijan stalno, jer smo imali besplatnu cugu na svirkama, a svirali smo puno. 2014. je Sane otišao u kurac i Dan mi je predložio da napravimo bend i sviramo moje stvari. Iako nekak radi čitave situacije nisam imao neke force to radit, napravili smo ga, al je uskoro i to otišlo u pimpek. Imali smo par koncerata, doduše, to je bilo fora. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dan me u međuvremenu nagovarao da snimimo album do kraja, al kak sam prečesto ne bio u zg, htio sam pričekat s tom idejom jer nisam imao pojma kad i kak. Snimanje albuma je ljudska i logistička noćna mora. </p>
<p>2017. sam izdao solo EP naziva ""Winter"", dio kvadrilogije ""Drawing Birds"" koji sam većinom snimio sam i miksao sam i iduće kaj sam trebao izdat je bio nastavak, ""Spring"". Na žalost, Dan nas je sve prerano napustio i odlučio sam snimiti sve stvari na hrvatskom, jer je on već snimio sve svoje gitare za taj album. Jako se usrano osjećam kaj radim ""in memoriam"" album, trebali smo to dovršit skupa, kak smo i počeli. Ali život je kurvetina. </p>
<p>Zapravo mi je žao kaj sve te pjesme sve ove godine sjede po kompjuteru il na youtubeu u jako lošoj kvaliteti, jer nisu loše pjesme. Neke su čak i odlične. Ne kažem da sam jeben, ali koliko užasnog najgoreg dna govna se izdaje svaki dan, blagi bože, zašto ja sumnjam u sebe imalo. Al eto, to tak ide. </p>
<p>Stvarno bi htio da kupite albume. Mislim da su stvarno dobri i da se isplati dat lovu za njih. I kaj je najgluplje, samo ću si pokrit troškove. Ak ikad uspijem zaradit lovu s ovim bez izdavačke kuće, pr agencije, ikakvih veza, poslat ću raketu u svemir. Dobro, neću u svemir, al neku prskalicu ću zapalit. </p>
<p>Na hrvatskom albumu mi kao Dno'k u dens pjesmi gostuje Sett iz Švestera (što ćete morat pričekat do izlaska albuma), a u najavnoj za engleski album Eeva iz Beograda koja je ubojica vokala sam takav. Svakak poslušajte, jer je stvar gotova i na youtubeu. &lt;3</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Kaj trebam, a kaj vi dobivate</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Trebam 2 soma eura. Toliko sam spičkao na albume do sad. Morao sam kupit novi komp, a mrzim kompjutere, morao sam kupit novu gitaru jer se stara rastočila ko cigan u birtiji stajačici, kupio sam neku pizdariju koja spriječava da mi vokal zvuči ko da sam u kupaoni pa ga se onda da miksat i mislim da će me miks koštat jedno soma eura. To je dosta depresivna činjenica, da stvari koštaju, općenito.</li>
<li>Tu bi trebao reć kaj brutalno nudim, tak mi nudi ovaj template, ali zapravo nudim to kaj sam radio, 18 pjesama na 2 jezika i na 2 albuma. Kao treći perk nudim stari EP za euro, ak uzmete ova dva. Nije tak loše. </li>
<li>Ak ne skupim 2 soma eura, i dalje ćete dobit albume jer jebeš mi mater, ovaj put izdajem albume i bit će jebeni. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>IMPAKT (prevodim template)</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit ću sretnija osoba, iskreno sretnija. Jebeš lovu. Al ono, da netko podržava ono kaj radim.</li>
<li>Jednom prije su me nagovorili da radim crowdfunding za knjigu koju zapravo stvarno iskreno nisam htio izdat i skupio sam nekih 600 eura, ali nisam stavio fleksibilni cilj. Pa nisam morao izdat knjigu. Više ne dopuštam ljudima da me nagovore na sranja, jer onda ja ispadam nedosljedni idiot. </li>
<li>Dakle, svakak dobivate albume. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Rizici i izazovi (opet prijevod) </h3>
<p>People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zadnja dva albuma Sanea sam uglavnom ja vodio što se organizacije tiče i uspio provest sve kaj smo trebali napravit najbolje kaj sam znao. Zapravo, na kraju smo se raspali i nismo mogli više, tak da ne znam dal su svi ljudi dobili drugi cd, jer smo sva trojica bili preumorni i od posla i jedni od drugih. Sad sve ovisi o meni, pa bar tu mogu ful bez beda preuzet svu odgovornost.  </li>
<li>Nemate rizik. Rizik je da će album izać u petom mjesecu, a ne u četvrtom i to ak miksovi ne budu gotovi na vrijeme. Al držim fige da budu. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Kaj možete ak mi ne date lovu</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Šerajte dok ne umrete od šeranja, šaljite svima, šaljite nekoliko puta dnevno, sve, stalno. </li>
<li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Ne znam kaj su Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Za kraj ću vam postavit dvije recenzije prošlog EP-a koje su napisali kolege koje iznimno cijenim, a koje do sad iz svima nepoznatog razloga, nikad nisam nigdje stavio. </p><p> </p><h3>JR August</h3><p>Čovjek koji iza sebe ima jedan od najbogatijih glazbenih puteva, nevjerojatan muzički talent, sviračku i pjevačku sposobnost te težnju poistovjećivanju s mnogobrojnim likovima unutar njegove osobe je Stefan Pelzreich, mnogima poznatiji kao Drito Konj, ili najnoviji one-man-band Two Hundred Million Idiots.</p><p>Drito iliti Two Hundred Million Idiots, pripadao je nekad vjerojatno najuvježbanijem i najspretnijem zagrebačkom trojcu Sane u kojem je još uz dvojicu glazbenih genijalaca, Nikolu i Seba stvarao autorsku muziku i zabavljao slušateljstvo odličnim coverima svjetskih hitova.</p><p>Danas Drito živi i radi u Berlinu pa je zbog toga i ušao u novi lik, što mu je itekako svojstveno, lik Stefana odnosno Two Hundred Million Idiots. Čak mi ova posljednja rečenica nije ni točna, jer, Stefan trenutno putuje po Dalekom istoku i uživa u životu slobodnjaka.</p><p>Zašto toliko volim glazbu ovog čovjeka, iako ga osobno ne poznajem dobro (upoznali smo se i pričali, sada već davno, u stanu Žanamari Lalić) je vrlo lako odgovoriti – zato jer, iako često mijenja stvaralačke persone – ne glumi! I to se definitivno čuje. Još jedna od stvari zbog kojeg volim to što taj čovjek radi je to što je nevjerojatno muzikalan. U svom glazbenom životu upoznao sam jako puno ljudi koji se bave muzikom. Neki ne znaju svirati, neki ne znaju pjevati, neki su slabi autori, neki slabi aranžeri, a neki su sve to ali suprotno, a opet nisu muzikalni. Po meni, Drito ima sve to i još je k tome i muzikalan, što je, ruku na srce, karakteristika koju sam vidio kod možda deset ljudi koje sam u životu upoznao.</p><p>Ovaj album je nešto o čemu ne treba pisati već ga treba slušati.

disclaimer: Odvratno sam skriboman, tak da por favor, imajte strpljenja pročitat ove pizdarije. 
Ajmo proć polako pizdarije koje su dovele do ovog projekta koji se upravo događa. Još kao klinac sam iznimno volio glazbu, što je učinilo da nakon kaj sam našao pradedinu klasičnu gitaru, poželim svirat gitaru. Skoro sam završio osnovnu muzičku za klasičnu gitaru, al onda su me starci odvukli u Đurđevac. Tamo sam kurac svirao gitaru, ali sam krajem srednje škole napravio bend imena Eto Zvuk (i dalje najbolje ime) u kojem sam svirao bubanj jer nitko drugi nije htio bit šupak na bubnju. Nakon povratka u zg sam svirao u bendu Notime Toulouse koji je fakat mogao bit jeben da svi nismo bili retardirani, pa sam snimio album sa Stampedom (Tandara Mandara 1998.), onda Massimom (Massimo 2002.), pa svirao sa Saneom, snimio live album sa Pips, Chips and Videoclips (Dokument 2004.), pa snažno gažerski svirao s Lanom Jurčević i Lukom Nižetićem (iako je bila super zajebancija) i snimio dva albuma sa Saneom (Do not cover 2012. i About Time 2014.).  Sve te godine sam malo svirao, malo pjevao, malo bio pijan ko sotona i odustajao od svega radi okolnosti ili karaktera, ne znam. 2006. sam dobio i dvije stipendije za faksove u londonu (vokal i bubanj), ali sam si mogao podanfat karu, jer nisam imao ni za kartu do Dugog Sela, a kamoli do Londona. 
Sve te godine sam nerijetko bio vrlo pijan i razočaran u činjenicu da se nemreš u hr bavit glazbom ak sa strane ne radiš neki najgluplji posao ikad i to za malo love. To je činjenica. I onda sam pijano bičao po blogu il forumu jer kaj ćeš drugo radit kad si u usranoj situaciji. Nikaj. 
 
2009., kad sam imao mrvu bolju situaciju i mogao sam sjest i počet snimat kak treba sam napisao i snimio 10 pjesama na hrvatskom u demo kvaliteti i iako sam ja mislio da su pjesme dobre, nitko od izdavača me nije jebao pol posto. Mislim da me ne bi jebali ni danas, jer će radije brijat na Festival Melodije Dijamantnog Pimpeka Ulješure u Škrbovićima, nego poslušat ikaj kaj zvuči drugačije. A kamoli izdat. U tom razdoblju se i Sane reaktivirao, pa sam prebacio sav fokus na to i radio isključivo to. I živio od mjuze, po prvi put u životu. I bio jako pijan stalno, jer smo imali besplatnu cugu na svirkama, a svirali smo puno. 2014. je Sane otišao u kurac i Dan mi je predložio da napravimo bend i sviramo moje stvari. Iako nekak radi čitave situacije nisam imao neke force to radit, napravili smo ga, al je uskoro i to otišlo u pimpek. Imali smo par koncerata, doduše, to je bilo fora. 
 
Dan me u međuvremenu nagovarao da snimimo album do kraja, al kak sam prečesto ne bio u zg, htio sam pričekat s tom idejom jer nisam imao pojma kad i kak. Snimanje albuma je ljudska i logistička noćna mora. 
2017. sam izdao solo EP naziva ""Winter"", dio kvadrilogije ""Drawing Birds"" koji sam većinom snimio sam i miksao sam i iduće kaj sam trebao izdat je bio nastavak, ""Spring"". Na žalost, Dan nas je sve prerano napustio i odlučio sam snimiti sve stvari na hrvatskom, jer je on već snimio sve svoje gitare za taj album. Jako se usrano osjećam kaj radim ""in memoriam"" album, trebali smo to dovršit skupa, kak smo i počeli. Ali život je kurvetina. 
Zapravo mi je žao kaj sve te pjesme sve ove godine sjede po kompjuteru il na youtubeu u jako lošoj kvaliteti, jer nisu loše pjesme. Neke su čak i odlične. Ne kažem da sam jeben, ali koliko užasnog najgoreg dna govna se izdaje svaki dan, blagi bože, zašto ja sumnjam u sebe imalo. Al eto, to tak ide. 
Stvarno bi htio da kupite albume. Mislim da su stvarno dobri i da se isplati dat lovu za njih. I kaj je najgluplje, samo ću si pokrit troškove. Ak ikad uspijem zaradit lovu s ovim bez izdavačke kuće, pr agencije, ikakvih veza, poslat ću raketu u svemir. Dobro, neću u svemir, al neku prskalicu ću zapalit. 
Na hrvatskom albumu mi kao Dno'k u dens pjesmi gostuje Sett iz Švestera (što ćete morat pričekat do izlaska albuma), a u najavnoj za engleski album Eeva iz Beograda koja je ubojica vokala sam takav. Svakak poslušajte, jer je stvar gotova i na youtubeu. <3
 

Kaj trebam, a kaj vi dobivate
 

Trebam 2 soma eura. Toliko sam spičkao na albume do sad. Morao sam kupit novi komp, a mrzim kompjutere, morao sam kupit novu gitaru jer se stara rastočila ko cigan u birtiji stajačici, kupio sam neku pizdariju koja spriječava da mi vokal zvuči ko da sam u kupaoni pa ga se onda da miksat i mislim da će me miks koštat jedno soma eura. To je dosta depresivna činjenica, da stvari koštaju, općenito.
Tu bi trebao reć kaj brutalno nudim, tak mi nudi ovaj template, ali zapravo nudim to kaj sam radio, 18 pjesama na 2 jezika i na 2 albuma. Kao treći perk nudim stari EP za euro, ak uzmete ova dva. Nije tak loše. 
Ak ne skupim 2 soma eura, i dalje ćete dobit albume jer jebeš mi mater, ovaj put izdajem albume i bit će jebeni. 


IMPAKT (prevodim template)
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:

Bit ću sretnija osoba, iskreno sretnija. Jebeš lovu. Al ono, da netko podržava ono kaj radim.
Jednom prije su me nagovorili da radim crowdfunding za knjigu koju zapravo stvarno iskreno nisam htio izdat i skupio sam nekih 600 eura, ali nisam stavio fleksibilni cilj. Pa nisam morao izdat knjigu. Više ne dopuštam ljudima da me nagovore na sranja, jer onda ja ispadam nedosljedni idiot. 
Dakle, svakak dobivate albume. 


Rizici i izazovi (opet prijevod) 
People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.

Zadnja dva albuma Sanea sam uglavnom ja vodio što se organizacije tiče i uspio provest sve kaj smo trebali napravit najbolje kaj sam znao. Zapravo, na kraju smo se raspali i nismo mogli više, tak da ne znam dal su svi ljudi dobili drugi cd, jer smo sva trojica bili preumorni i od posla i jedni od drugih. Sad sve ovisi o meni, pa bar tu mogu ful bez beda preuzet svu odgovornost.  
Nemate rizik. Rizik je da će album izać u petom mjesecu, a ne u četvrtom i to ak miksovi ne budu gotovi na vrijeme. Al držim fige da budu. 


Kaj možete ak mi ne date lovu
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Šerajte dok ne umrete od šeranja, šaljite svima, šaljite nekoliko puta dnevno, sve, stalno. 
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!
Ne znam kaj su Indiegogo share tools!

Za kraj ću vam postavit dvije recenzije prošlog EP-a koje su napisali kolege koje iznimno cijenim, a koje do sad iz svima nepoznatog razloga, nikad nisam nigdje stavio.  JR AugustČovjek koji iza sebe ima jedan od najbogatijih glazbenih puteva, nevjerojatan muzički talent, sviračku i pjevačku sposobnost te težnju poistovjećivanju s mnogobrojnim likovima unutar njegove osobe je Stefan Pelzreich, mnogima poznatiji kao Drito Konj, ili najnoviji one-man-band Two Hundred Million Idiots.Drito iliti Two Hundred Million Idiots, pripadao je nekad vjerojatno najuvježbanijem i najspretnijem zagrebačkom trojcu Sane u kojem je još uz dvojicu glazbenih genijalaca, Nikolu i Seba stvarao autorsku muziku i zabavljao slušateljstvo odličnim coverima svjetskih hitova.Danas Drito živi i radi u Berlinu pa je zbog toga i ušao u novi lik, što mu je itekako svojstveno, lik Stefana odnosno Two Hundred Million Idiots. Čak mi ova posljednja rečenica nije ni točna, jer, Stefan trenutno putuje po Dalekom istoku i uživa u životu slobodnjaka.Zašto toliko volim glazbu ovog čovjeka, iako ga osobno ne poznajem dobro (upoznali smo se i pričali, sada već davno, u stanu Žanamari Lalić) je vrlo lako odgovoriti – zato jer, iako često mijenja stvaralačke persone – ne glumi! I to se definitivno čuje. Još jedna od stvari zbog kojeg volim to što taj čovjek radi je to što je nevjerojatno muzikalan. U svom glazbenom životu upoznao sam jako puno ljudi koji se bave muzikom. Neki ne znaju svirati, neki ne znaju pjevati, neki su slabi autori, neki slabi aranžeri, a neki su sve to ali suprotno, a opet nisu muzikalni. Po meni, Drito ima sve to i još je k tome i muzikalan, što je, ruku na srce, karakteristika koju sam vidio kod možda deset ljudi koje sam u životu upoznao.Ovaj album je nešto o čemu ne treba pisati već ga treba slušati. Predivno aranžiran i osmišljen, a opet, prošao je mimo oka, odnosno uha domaćih kritičara. Ali, po drugoj strani, koga briga za kritičare. Oni do kojih ovaj album treba doći, - doći će.Cijeli album nema ni jednu bezveznu pjesmu, a tekstovi su vrlo promišljeni i pametni, baš kakve ih volim! Moj favorit s albuma je zapravo i bonus track albuma koja, doduše nema tekst, ali je filmski lijepa, predivno aranžirana kompozicija koja savršeno zaokružuje ovaj album koji je toliko pitak da ga možete slušati i ujutro i popodne i navečer. Mirela Priselac Remi (Elemental) ""Two hundred million idiots"" ima komplicirano ime ali jednostavnu muziku. Svi koji se bavimo muzikom znamo da je najteže napraviti nešto jednostavno. Lako se uhvatiti u pretjerivanje, overplay i nepotrebno ukrašavanje. Na kraju izgubiš poantu pjesme - zato su mi se Stjepanove note tako lako zalijepile na dušu.Materijal je jezgrovit, taman dovoljno traje da ne zamori. Ono što bih osobito istaknula su akustične pjesme, s minimalnim aranžmanom - mislim da je to pravac koji bi trebao više slijediti jer zvuči sjajno.Vokal je načet vremenom, poderan cigarama i cugom, ima neku patinu zbog čega povjeruješ u riječi koje pjeva. Autentično je, krvari iskrenošću, emocija nije lažna ni u jednom trenutku. Jedino što bih možda izbjegla repane pjesme - malo mi zvuči previše nedorađeno.Akustika is the way to go, minimalizam, jednostavnost, iskrenost.

Hello! We are the band We Happy based in Phoenix, Arizona.
We Happy is a project begun in 2015 as a female-fronted band. We call our musical style ""Vibe with an Edge"" as we combine different genres, such as rock, pop, indie, and alternative. Our goals are to connect with new fans, and to inspire others by spreading our message.
We have a love and passion for music! The 3 of us (Robert, Katie and Max) have been playing music together for 6 years and individually for over 10 years. We Happy are also music teachers. Email us at wehappy@wehappyband.com for info on lessons.

Robert and Katie teach at the School of Rock in Scottsdale, Arizona. Max teaches at Kirk's Studio for the Performing Arts also in Scottsdale. All members of We Happy play and teach multiple instruments. They teach 1-on-1 lessons and also direct performance programs where they help their students learn how to rock out with their class band live in concert.
We have been working very hard for the past 2+ years to reach our goal as musicians to write and record our first full length album. 
We’ve already self-funded the first half of our record, while spending time with our amazing producer, Curtis Douglas at Red Mountain Studios in Tempe. 
Curtis is known for recording bands such as The Maine, Katastro, Sunset Voodoo, and many more amazing artists. 
Have you ever popped your favorite band's CD into your car on a road trip and listened to it from front-to-back? We've always dreamt of doing this with our own full-length CD, and you can help us make that a reality!
Our campaign is important to us because we want to share with the world what we have been working on, for all ages and ears to listen to. We are thankful for the ongoing support from our fans, and without our ""happy campers"" we wouldn't be where we are.We also want our music to inspire our fans to spread positivity and good vibes

<h3>About TWIK</h3>
<p>From its' inception, The World I Knew has been about playing music and having fun. We are a group of guys who share a passion for good song-craft, fun shows and parties. But as time has progressed, this passion has turned into a movement, with our music turning into something more; an idea. The idea that we all are in the same boat, dealing with the same issues, and at the end of the day we all need a way to express the emotions that come with those issues, whether it be the pain of the daily struggle or simply wanting to forget the pain and dance the night away. TWIK represents everything.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In today's world a dream needs financial backing in order to materialize, lest it stay a dream forever. The fact is, bringing our music to the people we love is not as cheap as just writing the music. The music we have covered, but that is only the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>$2000 goes to recording alone</li>
<li>$700 for the pressing of the cds</li>
<li>$700 for merchandise to go with the release, including shirts, posters, stickers and hats</li>
<li>$600 for promoting the album, including advertising on all social media platforms, as well as radio</li>
<li>$500 for artwork and design for both the album and the merchandise</li>
<li>$500 for touring expenses for the album, such as gas</li>
</ul>
<p>While all of these expenses are budgeted generously, the fact is that bare minimum the album itself has to be recorded and pressed. So even if we do not reach our goal, just know that the first $2000 we receive will strictly go to the recording and the next $700 will go to pressing the CDs, bare minimum!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here at The World I Knew making music has always been our dream, and that goes for every member of our team. The idea of getting to do what we love for a living has always seemed like a pipe dream, but with each new song we write and show we play it has becomes more apparent that this dream we have, and the music we write, is meaningful and powerful to more than just us. So with that realization comes a motivation to become the most that we can be, continuing to write songs to help people and change lives, and hopefully someday write truly great songs for the ages.</p>
<p>In just the past year we have gone from 1,000 facebook followers to almost 3,500, with more people discovering our music everyday. We have gone from playing empty shows to only family and friends to opening for national bands with crowds of thousands, often drawing even the most reluctant of listeners at the back of the room to the stage. The evidence seems to point to the fact that we are on to something good here, and we are at the junction where we need the help and good faith of our fans to make that leap to finding out just how far this dream can go. Each and every one of you makes a difference to us! We love our music and we love making it, and we know that there are more lives out there to touch.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As normal people who work day jobs and do not have a lot of money to spare, we recognize that not everyone can help us reach our goal monetarily, but that does not mean that is the only way to help us get where we need to go! Even a simple share could help us connect with the right people! So please, share this page and our band's page to all of your friends, help us keep making noise!</p>

<h3>The band</h3>
<p>We're a rock &amp; roll band out of Poulsbo, WA and have spent the last several years honing our sound through live shows across Western Washington. After our first album we added a fourth member (Mikey Gentry), and have been slowly developing a new sound for the sophomore album. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>This is where you come in</h3>
<p>You’re basically the our record company. Because, well, we don’t have one, which is how we want to keep it! The first album I (Thys) saved up gig money and side work, and had some amazing people donate (thank you, you beautiful people who know who you are). We don't have time for that this time around. So we want your help by purchasing the album, and any of the other perks included. </p>
<p>Here's a list of the types of things we need to pay for to get this album out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time</li>
<li>Engineer / mixer</li>
<li>Mastering of final mixes</li>
<li>Vinyl production</li>
<li>Artwork and swag</li>
<li>Streaming service setups</li>
<li>Release promo</li>
</ul>
<p>We've done as much work on the songs as we can before we hit the studio to save recording fees, but we know we need a minimum of $10,000 to do it right. Although that's not a lot compared to other band's album costs, it's a lot to us :). But we also know it's a goal we can reach once our fans hear where our sound is going next, which is why we've paid to have one song recorded and released to say thank you to each of you who support us (you can hear a part of it in the video above).</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>“BACKROADS”</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>This project is being presented by me, J Streets AKA Julien Streetman.</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>BACKROADS has become my passion, and my vision is to produce the album and videos to the highest artistic level possible.</strong></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>I come from a family of musicians. My grandma Jannie Streetman was a self taught singer. She had such beautiful phrasing and authenticity to her singing whether it was gospel songs or the blues. My dad, <strong>Chic Street Man</strong>, has been a professional singer, songwriter, guitarist for almost 50 years. My uncle Dwight is the band leader and vocalist for a very successful Top 40’s band in Boston MA.</p>
<p>My Grandpa Sorensen was the Dean of Music at two prestigious colleges. My Uncle Karl has an award winning high school Jazz Band &amp; Choir and Concert Band &amp; Choir program. My mom is a classically trained violinist and has played professionally for 30 years.</p>
<p>I spent my childhood hearing all kinds of music, but in everyday life would hear my dad playing the blues in one room and my mom playing classical music in another. I formally studied violin for seven years and piano for three, and along the way picked up a bit guitar on my own.</p>
<p>When I decided to take a break from school to pursue this project, I realized music is in my blood. I am compelled to explore my own path.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong> “Backroads” is my debut album, expressing my journey.</strong></p>
<p>I actually wrote dozens of songs, but choose 12 to perfectly mold the project.</p>
<p>I have a close knit team that I work and consult with on a daily basis. They include business and artistic networking to develop the ground work for release of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Original artwork for the album cover by a prominent Northwest artist is in progress and I am very grateful and excited about it.</strong></p>
<p>There have been many steps along the way including writing the songs, the lyrics, and finding the right audio engineer and studio to work with.</p>
<p><strong>One crucial and very exciting part of “Backroads” is the video for the first track. I will be collaborating with film directors DJ McCoy and Sam Hansen.</strong> I have known DJ since we were in kindergarten together. While I started producing music at a   young age, DJ started working in film. While in high school he won a Junior Oscar. He is in film school in Los Angeles, so I will be going down there for 12 days to film the video with DJ and his crew. We have a very full and detailed schedule mapped out for every single day.</p>
<p><strong>“Backroads” is an artistic project, but there is so much more to it. The business of music has to be attended to with equal care. With that I have written a budget, a timeline, networked to lay the ground work for a successful release and managed all aspects of the project.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My main goal is to be true to my artistic vision and produce a true and authentic album and video.</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a songwriter and musician originally from Eastern Ontario.  I have recently moved back here after over a decade of living in the Yukon.  I'm excited to be recording with James Stephens at his studio near Old Chelsea in Quebec. </p>
<p>The subject matter for this album is raw and personal.  It reflects the evolution of my writing, playing and way of being since my departure from the Yukon.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $8,500.  This money will be used to pay the accompanying musicians and for studio fees that include engineering, mixing and mastering.  It will also be used for graphic design and reproduction.   The independent folk scene is not a lucrative one and cash flow is an on-going adventure.  </p>
<p>Everyone who contributes will receive a copy of the new album.  There are also exciting perks like guitar lessons, original artwork and private concerts.</p>
<p>Indie Go Go allows the option of 'flexible funding'.  This means that if I don't reach the targeted goal, I can still keep the money that has been contributed.  If the goal isn't reached, I will cover the remaining costs of the album personally.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this project you are supporting the creation of original music that follows the tradition of oral history and political protest.  It is a tradition that places value on the strength of community and I see crowd-funding as an opportunity to build community.   </p>
<p>Making this new album is at the heart of my creative process and my business practice.  Time in the studio is essential to clarifying and elaborating on my musical ideas.  It builds collaborative relationships, creating strong new material to reach to a wider audience through radio airplay and CD sales. It allows me to hone my ability to translate my lived experience into story, and to connect to the folk tradition.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>James Stephens and I are recording this album as a team at his studio.  We have been playing together for the past couple of years and have proven that we work well, bouncing musical ideas off of each other.  </p>
<p>While this will be my 3rd solo album, it is the 6th album I have recorded and released independently.  I have 5 albums worth of experience in organising this scope of project and while there will inevitably be hurdles to jump along the way, I know my legs are long enough to get over them.  </p>
<p>Financing this album is the biggest challenge I face.  I will contribute my own funds raised from playing gigs, teaching guitar lessons and guiding canoe trips.  Any amount you are able to contribute will be of great value.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to make a financial contribution you can still be a part of this project by helping to get the word out to your friends and family.  You can share this page through social media and beyond.  Lets make some noise together and make this thing happen.  Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>Everybody always talks about supporting musicians, and here is the chance to do it for real!</p>
<p>I would be very happy if you could help me to cover the following direct expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mastering</li>
<li>A bit of Promotion</li>
<li>Power and Heating for the Studio for a duration of 120 days at 10 hour workdays. </li>
<li>Food for about 100 of those days.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount is a bare minimum and doesn't include any salary for me, equipment, rent, pension etc. If I included those things, I would need to ask for at least 10-15 times more, given the high costs of living in Switzerland.</p>
<p>It was only possible for me to invest 1200 hours into making this album, because I have a daytime job and was able to spread the work over several years. Which is why I only release an album once in 5-10 years.<br/><br/>If I was able to make a living with the music I would of course make a lot more music and that means if we exceed the campaign goal I will fully invest every cent into making more music.</p>

<h3>This is Us....</h3>
<p>We are parents of six flesh and blood, beautiful, hormonal, creative cyclones. They are our primary source of joy, pain, hope, and pride. Nurturing them and helping them become human beings who make a positive imprint on our world is our highest calling, most glorious adventure, and most exhausting task. We are songwriters; shaping our experiences into melody and harmony. </p>

<p>Our first album, Let Fall the Fine was like giving birth to a seventh child. The songs were formed and created deep in our hearts from our own experiences living, loving, and working in central Vermont. It was a unique and precious experience working with David Goldsworthy of Little Gems Productions to record them. And our greater community helped us bring that album into the world in more ways than can be numbered. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We began recording with Kristina Stykos of Pepperbox Studios in early spring. We decided to approach this record a little differently and more traditionally, laying down isolated instrumentation first and adding vocals later. It has been a totally new experience and one that has taken many hours. We are really excited about the end result. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524153050/zc3nidkawifvnfuakn7t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now that everything has been recorded, we have exhausted our own resources and will need to reach out again to our community of fans to help us bring you the finished product. The tracks all need mixing and mastering and then can be sent off to be pressed! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524153096/mvobzhv6izwb5oqrz2f3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are 1970s kids. We grew up on vinyl and cassette tapes and saw the emergence of the CD. To us, holding a physical album in our hands is part of the experience of listening to music. I can remember so vividly that feeling of ripping open the plastic wrap on a new album and pouring over the album art while I listened to the music for the first time. Looking at the photography and album art, reading the lyrics and hearing the stories behind the songs would always connect me deeper to a song and the artist. And, of course, it always solved the inevitable lyric pronunciation mysteries. </p>
<p>We want to carry forward that experience in this generation of digital downloads and iCloud storage. While technology has many advantages, we want to give you something beautiful to hold in your hands.</p>

<h2>The Cost Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a few tracks that we want to add some extra instrumentation to....having a guy in the band that plays five instruments is pretty handy and just too tempting to resist. We'll need to cover our studio costs to go back to Pepperbox and add a little bass here and there....$1,000</li>
<li>We will need to cover costs for the editing and mixing. $1,200-$1,500. We came to the studio prepared and have worked very hard in our sessions. We've payed for all of the studio time, but Kristina now needs to edit and mix the tracks to bring you the best possible sound. She is a gypsy stardust queen at the mixing board; an artist herself, making a living at her passion as a sound engineer and musician in Vermont. And when she's not in the studio, she's got her hands in the dirt as a landscaper.  It has been an absolute honor to work with her on this project. </li>
<li>After the mixing is completed, Kristina will send our songs out to be mastered. $1,200-$1,500.</li>
<li>Album art: I had the pleasure and privilege of attending a private arts high school in Massachusetts for my junior and senior years of high school. Jason Goodwin, a fellow WHS alum, has agreed to provide the album art for our new record. We had a very specific vision for the album art, and he jumped right in and has created something absolutely stunning to pair with the songs on this album. We are so excited to bridge these two mediums to bring you a sensory experience of listening to our music. $500</li>
<li>Pressing the album and duplicating the CDs with a companion booklet of art, photographs, and lyrics is $2,100. We are going for it here with a global distribution package to expand our audience.</li>
<li><p>Indiegogo collects 5% of whatever we raise for the use of their ingenious fundraising platform. </p></li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are so proud of this project. We have grown over the last two years as human beings, as musicians, and as songwriters. Making music and writing songs is how we share ourselves and make an impact on the broader world and leave an imprint for our kids beyond the grave. We have faith that this new album will reflect both the pain and the joy of that growth. But most of all, we believe this album holds a special message in the midst of this violent and sometimes painfully divided culture.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It has been somewhat of a challenge for us to approach recording a new album. Our passion is to bring you the absolute best from ourselves musically, but we are confined financially. Andy works full time as a carpenter and I am a homeschooling mother. This album has pulled a lot from us as artists and we wish we had infinite monetary resources to keep up with the artistic vision.  That is where community comes in....</p>
<p>Having been through this process once before, and having received such a tremendous and overwhelming amount of support for our first album, we have hope and confidence in our community of family, friends, fans, fellow artists, and musicians to help us bridge the financial gap and complete this project. When you back this new album, it is an investment in the growth of our duo, it pays local artists who are pressing through the practicalities of life to pursue their passion, AND you will receive the gift of homegrown music on a canvas of handcrafted art. It is a winning formula! </p>
<p>We are choosing flexible funding again which allows us to keep whatever we raise at the end of the campaign even if we don't reach our proposed goal. We want this album to be born into the world even if it takes longer than we hoped. We will only run the campaign for 30 days. With the funds raised, we can finish this project with the care with which we began it. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's not always about money....</p>
<p>Every contribution helps us reach our goal, so don't think your $10 won't make a difference and please don't be confined by the maximum limits we set. Anything over and above what we need to raise only helps us do more with our music. And if you can't make a financial contribution, please share our story, our campaign, and our music! Most of all, please come hear us play locally. Nothing is so encouraging and meaningful to us as musicians than to have an audience who wants to hear our music.</p>

<h3>Business Summary/History</h3>
<p>The initial idea to start a label was conceived years ago by our founder/manager/beat scientist Chace Springborn. The concept for the label developed as we saw a need for upcoming artists to join a team of experienced professionals all dedicated to the same cause. These days record labels aren’t willing to take risks on unestablished artists. We saw that many of our peers had the talent to succeed in the industry but didn’t have the right team behind them. We saw artists locked into contracts that robbed them not only of their money but also their creative control. These experiences are what molded our philosophy. We are a label that provides loyalty, freedom and passionate dedication to artists that we believe have the raw talent and drive to make an impact on the culture. Later on we had the idea to not only work for the artist, but to educate artists so that they can begin to work for themselves. Education is a crucial part of our company. We’ve all been lucky enough to have the resources to learn about the industry and we feel that it is our responsibility to pay that forward. As a band, over the past year we've been striving to create the scene in Boston that we wish to thrive in. We host hip hop nights every second Thursday at the Middle East, booking local artists that we believe are making an impact on the culture. We hope that through this company and our artistic output we can put Boston on the map and set a higher bar for every other record company. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We genuinely believe that the vision we have for this company will change the way that the music industry values art and the artists who give so much to us. In this day in age the traditional standards that record companies operate under are quite frankly outdated and contribute negatively to the culture. Record companies would rather minimize their risk by bleeding already well established artists of their revenue and creative vision than provide loyalty and dedication to artists that can revolutionize the culture and make a difference in the world. We know that it's time for a change. Our company is not about making millions but rather about shaking up the music industry and making a positive impact on our culture in the time that we have in this world. We know that this won't be an easy road, but we believe with hard work and passion it is achievable. On a more day to day basis we hope to inspire upcoming artists by providing discounted lessons for underprivileged kids in the Boston area.  We’ve been incredibly fortune to be able to attend music schools and participate in outstanding music programs. One of our main goals is to foster creativity and technique in the next generation of artists. We hope that this will be a lasting legacy left by of our company. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We know, we know, it's a lot of money! We've done a lot of planning to pin point how much money we need to make this dream a reality. Let's break it down, we need: </p>

Friends!<br/>It’s been a long time coming and many of you have been eagerly asking! After dedicating most my life to music, and music performance, I am finally ready to dedicate the time to record a studio album for all of you. FluteTrance has been quite the journey and now I'm moving forward with my name as just ""<i><strong>Giselle""</strong></i>!</p><p>As many of you know I trained and dedicated over 20 years to classical music and then found myself wanting to create something different and unique based on fusion. <br/>Inspired by Miami's own electronic dance scene, as well as some other very popular conscious dance scenes, like ones in Ibiza and Bali, coupled with my personal ties to Native American/indigenous music and rituals, this album will achieve a warping balance between the haunting intimacy of underground electronic music, tribal melodies and rhythms from varying indigenous cultures, and the sweetness of lullaby music presented in an unconfined air of horizon-scanning grandeur in the choruses. <br/>The main melodies of this music have been composed by me with the intention of reaching your soul for healing and awakening in a mostly subliminal manner as this is primarily instrumental music without lyrics to guide your emotions. Many melodies are also coming from traditional “medicine music”; music that is for healing. </p><p><br/><strong>I am, for the first time in my life, feeling brave enough to offer my music up to my community and the world as part of that bigger picture.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Many people close to me have been aware that I have always been involved with different types of music, and most recently this “medicine music”. Over the years, I’ve created an arsenal of original songs, and have finally realized they’re worth keeping around and developing thanks to the unyielding support and encouragement of my family and friends. This project will help introduce my music to a broader audience, as well as share the writing that has become such a big part of who I am.</p><p><br/><strong>All has been aligning beautifully and naturally for this project to begin and move forward. This Indiegogo campaign is the last step I need to take, and your support will help make this album real.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511064186/mzos4tvb3bacxyuo0wgu.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511061645/yth4qnvgbflvi7eepwcb.png"" src=""""/></p><p>This campaign is raising funds for my first professionally recorded album with <strong>Walker Barnard</strong>, a producer, musician, and engineer with 15+ years of experience working with both established and up-and-coming musicians. He is also the mastermind behind the magical electronic ""Air Festival"" held on the Gili Islands. Walker is truly a weaver of sounds and a bridger of worlds, constantly reinventing and always focused on the one true path of dance floor transcendence and creation of love-infused sonic architecture. I'm super stoked to have him as my producer for this album.</p><p>Together, Walker and I are digging into my original material, revising arrangements, and adding creative ideas to bring my songs to life in a way that wouldn’t be possible without your help.</p><p>I am hoping to raise $20,000. This will cover all the costs of the recording, production and distribution of the album.</p><p>As a preview of the album, Walker and I are preparing to release a 3-song EP called <i>""Tribal Waters"" </i>very soon exhibiting some of the sound of this upcoming album.</p><p>This album is being produced in what we call a prayerful and conscious way. Many of the tracks are inspired by music intended for healing and awakening our consciousness to our divine purpose as human beings to be love, take care of each other, and especially take care of our Mother Earth.</p><p>To create an album of this quality and involvement, studio time and producing costs add up quickly. With that said, this campaign can give us a unique opportunity to collaborate and make great art together. Your donation will cover following costs of my project:<br/> </p><p><strong>1. Pre-Production:</strong> This is where everything starts. Walker and I sit down, taking original song ideas and starting to craft the arrangements for each of these songs that will eventually go on the album. Here, we take the time to create a rough sketch of each song, mapping out structure, which helps me, Walker, and any other musicians involved better envision our goals for each song before we start recording.  This ensures maximum use of studio time and a better understanding of the goals of each piece before recording.</p><p><strong>2. Recording:</strong> This is when I enter the studio and start capturing the music and where the songs become what you'll hear on this album. Here, we can also add instruments I don’t currently play myself, but that will take my arrangements to the next level, like drums, bass, electric guitar and any other instrument that will add the perfect texture and balance to these songs. ($10,000)</p><p><strong>3. Mixing &amp; Mastering:</strong> Each track will get mixed to create the right balance between instruments, texture and color that make up a track. As a final step, the album will be mastered from beginning to end, so the listening experience is cohesive and carefully choreographed from start to finish.  Like editing a book, it is making sure every phrase and note is placed perfectly. ($3,500)</p><p><strong>4. Featured Musicians: </strong>I will be inviting some other top musicians to record on this album guitar, percussion, bass, secondary vocals, and other exotic instruments and need them to be compensated. ($2000)</p><p><strong>5. Basic PR/Marketing/Artwork: </strong>I'll be seeking press and media support in various cities where I have a following. Some will be editorial features, and interviews, as well as video promotion. I'll also need support covering the expense of the artwork. ($3000)</p><p><strong>6. Indiegogo Fees: </strong>All amazing platforms usually have fees and Indiegogo is no exception. The remaining balance will go to supporting the fees.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511061789/z4qn9nqovpdjfm1l3tzu.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Every show of support is meaningful to me. Here’s the chance to get something in return for your support!!</strong></p><p>I am so appreciative and grateful for any help people can lend to this campaign. <strong>I've put together an exciting group of gifts that are available exclusively through your participation in this campaign, so that everyone can benefit from this project!</strong></p><p>Some examples are below and a full list to the right!

Friends!It’s been a long time coming and many of you have been eagerly asking! After dedicating most my life to music, and music performance, I am finally ready to dedicate the time to record a studio album for all of you. FluteTrance has been quite the journey and now I'm moving forward with my name as just ""Giselle""!As many of you know I trained and dedicated over 20 years to classical music and then found myself wanting to create something different and unique based on fusion. Inspired by Miami's own electronic dance scene, as well as some other very popular conscious dance scenes, like ones in Ibiza and Bali, coupled with my personal ties to Native American/indigenous music and rituals, this album will achieve a warping balance between the haunting intimacy of underground electronic music, tribal melodies and rhythms from varying indigenous cultures, and the sweetness of lullaby music presented in an unconfined air of horizon-scanning grandeur in the choruses. The main melodies of this music have been composed by me with the intention of reaching your soul for healing and awakening in a mostly subliminal manner as this is primarily instrumental music without lyrics to guide your emotions. Many melodies are also coming from traditional “medicine music”; music that is for healing. I am, for the first time in my life, feeling brave enough to offer my music up to my community and the world as part of that bigger picture. Many people close to me have been aware that I have always been involved with different types of music, and most recently this “medicine music”. Over the years, I’ve created an arsenal of original songs, and have finally realized they’re worth keeping around and developing thanks to the unyielding support and encouragement of my family and friends. This project will help introduce my music to a broader audience, as well as share the writing that has become such a big part of who I am.All has been aligning beautifully and naturally for this project to begin and move forward. This Indiegogo campaign is the last step I need to take, and your support will help make this album real. This campaign is raising funds for my first professionally recorded album with Walker Barnard, a producer, musician, and engineer with 15+ years of experience working with both established and up-and-coming musicians. He is also the mastermind behind the magical electronic ""Air Festival"" held on the Gili Islands. Walker is truly a weaver of sounds and a bridger of worlds, constantly reinventing and always focused on the one true path of dance floor transcendence and creation of love-infused sonic architecture. I'm super stoked to have him as my producer for this album.Together, Walker and I are digging into my original material, revising arrangements, and adding creative ideas to bring my songs to life in a way that wouldn’t be possible without your help.I am hoping to raise $20,000. This will cover all the costs of the recording, production and distribution of the album.As a preview of the album, Walker and I are preparing to release a 3-song EP called ""Tribal Waters"" very soon exhibiting some of the sound of this upcoming album.This album is being produced in what we call a prayerful and conscious way. Many of the tracks are inspired by music intended for healing and awakening our consciousness to our divine purpose as human beings to be love, take care of each other, and especially take care of our Mother Earth.To create an album of this quality and involvement, studio time and producing costs add up quickly. With that said, this campaign can give us a unique opportunity to collaborate and make great art together. Your donation will cover following costs of my project: 1. Pre-Production: This is where everything starts. Walker and I sit down, taking original song ideas and starting to craft the arrangements for each of these songs that will eventually go on the album. Here, we take the time to create a rough sketch of each song, mapping out structure, which helps me, Walker, and any other musicians involved better envision our goals for each song before we start recording.  This ensures maximum use of studio time and a better understanding of the goals of each piece before recording.2. Recording: This is when I enter the studio and start capturing the music and where the songs become what you'll hear on this album. Here, we can also add instruments I don’t currently play myself, but that will take my arrangements to the next level, like drums, bass, electric guitar and any other instrument that will add the perfect texture and balance to these songs. ($10,000)3. Mixing & Mastering: Each track will get mixed to create the right balance between instruments, texture and color that make up a track. As a final step, the album will be mastered from beginning to end, so the listening experience is cohesive and carefully choreographed from start to finish.  Like editing a book, it is making sure every phrase and note is placed perfectly. ($3,500)4. Featured Musicians: I will be inviting some other top musicians to record on this album guitar, percussion, bass, secondary vocals, and other exotic instruments and need them to be compensated. ($2000)5. Basic PR/Marketing/Artwork: I'll be seeking press and media support in various cities where I have a following. Some will be editorial features, and interviews, as well as video promotion. I'll also need support covering the expense of the artwork. ($3000)6. Indiegogo Fees: All amazing platforms usually have fees and Indiegogo is no exception. The remaining balance will go to supporting the fees. Every show of support is meaningful to me. Here’s the chance to get something in return for your support!!I am so appreciative and grateful for any help people can lend to this campaign. I've put together an exciting group of gifts that are available exclusively through your participation in this campaign, so that everyone can benefit from this project!Some examples are below and a full list to the right!

 It's hard to express how much this project has the ability to change my life and the way I view what I do. Music has this incredible ability to heal and unite people, and to express and transmit feelings that help us feel connected in fundamental human ways. For a long time, I was under the impression that I wasn’t doing enough with my music, when in truth, it was because I did not think it would be possible or that anything would come of it. Thanks to Walker Barnard and this opportunity, I have come across a renewed faith in myself and my music that can only go forward from here.  Having the ability to make this album is something that will open many doors for me to provide the music I write and the message I want to send to those who might be able to benefit from them in the same way that I do from writing them.  If you’d like to contribute, just click the pink ""Contribute Now"" button on the top right of this page.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>We’ve been making music together since childhood</h3>
<p>We met as young misfits at Concord Youth Theater in Massachusetts where we performed in musicals as pirates, lost boys, monkeys and kangaroos.</p>
<p>In 2016, after years of drifting in and out of each other’s lives, we reunited in Los Angeles as housemates. Our childhood bond over musical theater became the foundation for our new connection as career musicians. Lucas is a multi-instrumental composer and producer, Addy is a songwriter, singer, and producer.</p>
<p>The birthplace of Jane’s Addiction, 369 Wilton Place has a musical legacy that inspired us to revitalize our spider infested garage into a functioning production/recording studio.  Even though we were still working 40 hours a week, we spent every free moment on our project.  We began commercial operation in May 2018, providing tutoring in Ableton music production to emerging musicians.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for this cozy spot behind our house to become a favorite hang-out for stray cats and a growing group of up-and-coming music and entertainment talent. The growth we’ve experienced - despite our very limited resources - has compelled us to take 369 North Studio to the next level. </p> <h2>What sets 369 North Studio Apart?</h2>
<p>369 North Studio is full-service recording and production studio with a unique focus on artist coaching, learning, and development. We are committed to helping artists evolve through creative anxiety, perfectionism, and fear of failure. </p>
<p>We’re guided by our deep passion and curiosity for all styles of music and creative process while maintaining a fun and relaxed environment. </p>
<p>We strive to facilitate multi-genre art of the highest quality to expand creative possibilities for our artists, their teams, and their fans. </p> <h2>Why are we crowdfunding?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re fundraising $15,000 to <strong>expand our business activities, upgrade our space and services, and support our artists in taking their creative projects to market. </strong></p>
<h3>Supporting our artists</h3>
<p>Many projects curated at 369 North thus far are ready to move forward. With your support, we will be able to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Prepare and conduct pitches for sync licenses</strong> for television and film! </li>
<li>
<strong>Develop PR and market budgets</strong> to help our artists expand their audiences! </li>
<li>
<strong>Expand our network</strong> of consultants and creative professionals to help our artists build project teams and go to market! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Expanding our capabilities</h3>
<p>With your help, we’ll be able to outfit the studio with better equipment, complete the process of completing our quirky backyard space’s transition into the 21st century (while still maintaining its nostalgic 20th century charm!). We’ll do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Conducting repairs</strong> because our floors are damaged from a pesky leak in our roof! </li>
<li>
<strong>Building storage and shelving</strong> to take the best possible care of our equipment!</li>
<li>
<strong>Outfitting the space</strong> by completing the sound treatment!</li>
<li>
<strong>Building a vocal isolation booth</strong> for recording industry quality vocal tracking! </li>
<li>
<strong>Improving our inventory</strong> by expanding our selection of microphones and music toys!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Building up our business</h3>
<p>We’re committed to fostering a flourishing symbiotic ecosystem of independent artists, freelancers, and entrepreneurs.  </p>
<p>We’ve been blessed to have incredibly talented people lending us their time, ideas, and energy to bring 369 North Studio to where it is right now. With financial support, we can hire these skilled designers and consultants to finish helping us set our business up to succeed. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>How are we going to do that? </h2>
<h3><strong>By bringing you into the fold! </strong></h3>
<p>We’re most excited to offer you the chance to develop your own custom song in any genre, no matter how silly or serious the topic. </p>
<p>We’ll get to know you, what you are looking for, and then write, compose, produce and record the best song you never knew you needed! </p>
<p>In addition to custom song package,we’ve opted out of purely traditional campaign perks and instead, designed a range of service packages and treats with both artists and art lovers in mind! </p>
<p><strong>Some of our pack</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Professional production and engineering services</strong> with our experienced and highly capable founders! </li>
<li>
<strong>Remote and on-site lessons and tutorials</strong> in songwriting, music production, sound engineering tools, and more for you or as a gift! </li>
<li>
<strong>Professional project development services</strong> from recording and producing your EP to project planning, photoshoots, video content, and anything else you need for your project to succeed! </li>
<li>
<strong>Private concerts</strong> by 369 North’s incredibly talented artists! </li>
<li>
<strong>Access to our music catalogue</strong> for your listening pleasure! </li>
<li>
<strong>Studio and artist merchandise</strong> to show your support for independent art, small business, or just look fly! </li>
</ul> <h3>The risks and challenges of our venture</h3>
<p>369 North Studio is not simply a dream, but is already a profitable business. Our main challenge is to attract more clients and grow the studio that today includes a few microphones, a piano, a synthesizer, 4 guitars, Ableton software, and a universal audio interface. The risk is that we will grow slow. But whatever happens, we’re going to continue our work and continue to find new ways to move forward.</p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This campaign is about more than just fundraising.  We are hoping this campaign will continue to expand our artistic community and establish 369 North Studio as a place for artists of all kinds to collaborate and grow. </p>
<p>If you aren't able to pledge money (we’ve been there), there are still plenty of ways to support us on this journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Share our campaign using Indiegogo’s share tools</strong> because crowdfunding requires a real crowd!</li>
<li>
<strong>Talk about our artist coaching and other studio services</strong> with friends, family, and any artists who might benefit from our heavily discounted campaign service packages! </li>
<li>
<strong>Follow us on Facebook and Instagram</strong> and comment on our posts with your ideas and suggestions!</li>
<li>
<strong>Tell us about your services</strong> if you’re a freelancer, entrepreneur, entertainment lawyer, consultant, or interested in collaborating with us or on our artists’ projects! </li>
<li>
<strong>Introduce us to artists, music journalists, and creatives</strong> who need a studio to call home! </li>

So let's spread the news!!!!</p></div>","Hey Guys!!!!First of all, I'm so lucky that I've been blessed that you are a member of my awesome community of supportive people who love what I'm doing on the internet. Thank you for making it possible to release my first album! The purpose of this continued campaign is in order to keep pre-orders organized, since so many people approached me to tell me that they missed the cut off for the campaign that was here: https://igg.me/at/ariellaalbum/x/21965608#/ . We nearly reached our goal there, and so if you want to join us to make this album happen, I would be so grateful to you for your support. This is a continuation campaign for people who were interested in joining and felt like it was too short, or didn't get in on time. The cd is NOT going to be released to digital platforms, rather will be released as singles over the course of a year. That means that if you want the full cd, you must order it here or buy from me directly. Now, back to the story.As an Orthodox Jew, I've found the violin to be a great bridge between my community and people outside the community who see me as their eyes onto Israel and Judaism - especially as I share my experiences with you guys, my tribe, on social media. Since starting this journey to finding a unique musical contribution to the world, I've experimented with rock n roll, bluegrass, jazz, folk, ethnic music, looping, singing, and Irish music.And now, drum roll, please! I'm so excited to say that I'm going to be releasing my first album that blends all of this together. And here's where you come in. I can't do this alone.I've worked so hard to bring this music into the world- this new genre, this upbeat, inspiring music, this mix between genres, this bridge between cultures- but it's an expensive journey. It requires:- Hours in the studio, recording, arranging, mixing, mastering.- Producing videos- Putting on shows and promoting the album.I've started on my own but I need you for this next step. This is music that is deep and awesome and powerful, and has already spread internationally to dance troupes all over the world.  And now, here's your part. You’re the final bridge to bringing this into the world/ making this possible. You can preorder the cd, I'll write a song for you, buy some swag, book a private lesson, or book me for your venue (I'll be doing a US tour in November), and if you're local, come join me at the launch party with the full band.

<p>Midway through last year I was burnt out from running a startup. I was asking myself a lot of important questions, one of which was -- how can I bring more joy into my life? I decided that I wanted to get back into music. This EP represents not only the culmination of the first year of my journey into music production, but the beginning of a new way of being which allows me to dare to create from my heart. By supporting it, you will be helping me birth my first born :)<br/><br/><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>I'm looking to raise a total of about $5k. I'm planning on pressing 100 vinyls and printing 20 t-shirts but can adjust that depending on how the campaign goes. If I don't reach my target, I will still go ahead with the project out of my own pocket. All donors will get the full album digitally for free. I can only list 3 perks per contribution level here. Please review the tiers to see the exact perks for each level of contribution. I’m targeting the end of February to have all the perks delivered.<br/><br/><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong><br/>If you're unable to contribute financially, no worries! There are other ways that you could support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow me on <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/rio_musica/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SoundCloud</a>

<li>Introduce me to your friends at labels :)</li>

<p><strong>Thank You!</strong><br/>There are a number of people I want to thank for your encouragement and sincere feedback, helping motivate me and holding me to a high standard. Special shout-outs to my parents and brother, Sahill, Vicki, Danny, Usman, Hillary Jor, Brogan, Mr Bill, Clarissa, Sandeep, Mikael, Javier, Anant, Sid, Lennart, Brittany, Danny, Anja, Erica, Laurens, Christine, Antonio, Axel, Toni, Ankush, Auggie and a bunch of random folks who have listened to my unfinished tracks on Soundcloud.
