The distance will no longer stop you from having your clothes washed for you by the time you arrive from work, or from opening the door for your guests before you get home.



Enter a default room on the APP or create a new one and arrange your devices. For example: put the toaster in the kitchen space and add a photo to identify it.



We will warn you if your kids turn on the TV when they shouldn’t or if the lights have been kept on too many hours. Create as many alerts as you like.


Why we are different? We are COMPATIBLE.


Dymotic allows you to control any domotic device from just ONE app. Our list of compatible brands will increase continuously to make your life easier.



Why we need you? We want to illuminate many more!

We offer this app FREE. You will get advanced features and IA for a monthly fee of 1€ per device. We also offer a one-charge plan.

You don’t need to make a big investment to enjoy a simple, comfortable and modern domotic system.

<br/><strong>Which phones are compatible with popSLATE 2?</strong><br/>popSLATE 2 will be compatible with the iPhone 6, 6S, 6+, and 6S+. We are currently working on prototypes to work with other devices. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<strong>Will popSLATE 2 provide my phone extra battery?</strong><br/>With normal use, popSLATE’s onboard battery will provide up to 9 hours extra talk time and 5 hours extra internet time on the iPhone 6S+ and 6 hours extra talk time and 4 hours extra internet time on the iPhone 6S. Additionally, by offloading tasks to popSLATE’s ultra-low-power e-ink display rather than unlocking and using your iPhone’s power-hungry screen, we anticipate significant additional power savings to further extend your iPhone’s battery life.</div><div><strong><br/></strong></div><div>
<strong>How do you charge popSLATE?</strong><br/>There is a single point of charge for your popSLATE and your iPhone, so you can charge both simultaneously using with your normal Lightning cord.<br/><br/><strong>How long will the battery last on a charge?</strong><br/>You never need to worry about the charging of your popSLATE, since the battery lasts far longer than the iPhone battery, and you charge both devices at the same time.<br/><br/><strong>Will popSLATE interfere with my phone reception or my NFC transmissions?</strong><br/>No, popSLATE has been designed to meet Apple Made for iPhone (MFI) requirements to ensure that it does not interfere with reception or transmissions whatsoever. <br/><br/><strong>Is popSLATE fragile? How can it protect my phone?</strong><br/>Despite its sleek design, popSLATE is very robust. The second screen consists of special plastic materials (not glass), making it shatter-proof. Its unique slider design pays close attention to protection, from the Apple-mandated bumpers to protect your phone’s screen to the impact-resistant materials used to encase the rest of your phone, while still allowing the beauty of your iPhone to shine through.<br/><br/><strong>How thin is popSLATE?</strong><br/>popSLATE only adds only 4 mm (0.16"") to your phone at its thickest part and nearly no added thickness on the edges. This is nearly 40% thinner than our original popSLATE. The elegantly curved screen and cover glass further enhance the thinness.<br/><strong><br/>Does popSLATE display color?</strong><br/>No. The popSLATE second screen uses a 200 dpi, B&amp;W/16-bit greyscale e-ink display, which enables sharp, rich rendering of text, photographs, and other images to complement front-side color experience. <br/><br/><strong>Does the popSLATE screen use touch interactions?</strong><br/>Yes. We intentionally designed popSLATE to require minimal interaction. There are three capacitive-touch buttons just below the screen to switch modes and navigate content. The user experience is optimized to take advantage of the unique complementary second-screen.<br/><br/><strong>How do I use popSLATE?</strong><br/><strong>1. </strong>Attach popSLATE to your phone by sliding the cover on and connecting it to your iPhone’s Lightning connector. <br/><strong>2. </strong>Download the popSLATE app from the App Store, which will provide you with directions on how to set your device up. <br/><strong>3. </strong>Once your popSLATE set up is complete, you will be able to use the app to find, create and personalize content to display on your second screen.<br/><strong><br/>Does popSLATE show the same thing on the front side as the back? In other words, does popSLATE support ‘mirroring’ on the second screen?</strong><br/>No, and for a very good reason. We want popSLATE to complement, not replace your frontside experience on your iPhone. The popSLATE backside offers ambient images and information at a glance, and the frontside of your iPhone is where you go for more interactive tasks. </div><div>
<br/><strong>What is the size of the popSLATE ePaper screen?</strong><br/>The iPhone 6+/6S+ will have a 4.7"" ePaper display and the 6/6S will leverage a 4.3"" display.<br/><br/><strong>What new sources will I be able to access on my popSLATE?</strong><br/>popSLATE leverages content through providers’ interfaces (APIs) to access content for your feed and dashboard.

in photography has been moving forward rapidly in recent decades. Taking photos
and videos have become part of our daily life, not only for capturing and sharing
our precious moment, but also recording useful information in the workplace.</p>
<p>Ordinary photos and videos can only be shown on display devices as image
plane which we are no longer satisfied with this. Instead, we want something that’s
more interactive as well as creating immersive experience for people. 360 photos and videos are absolutely the things we are looking for, which allow us to pan
round the scene view in a full circle. Have your own scene, Have your own view.</p>
<p>Here we come up the idea of SnapCam360, a handy camera combining
snap shot and 360<sup>o</sup> camera function, for you to take photos and videos
easily with a single device.</p>
<p>And now you can share the new perspective with everybody with SnapCam360.
Thanks to the two social media giants, Facebook and YouTube. They have begun to
support 360<sup>o</sup> videos, making 360<sup>o</sup> videos become more and
more popular this year. </p>

in photography has been moving forward rapidly in recent decades. Taking photos

our precious moment, but also recording useful information in the workplace.
Ordinary photos and videos can only be shown on display devices as image
plane which we are no longer satisfied with this. Instead, we want something that’s
more interactive as well as creating immersive experience for people. 360 photos and videos are absolutely the things we are looking for, which allow us to pan
round the scene view in a full circle. Have your own scene, Have your own view.

snap shot and 360o camera function, for you to take photos and videos
easily with a single device.

A growing number of client requests combined with my market research suggested that there needs to be a better way of carrying your tablet to and from work, on holidays, or just a day trip. You can now own the first case to provide light mobility, full coverage, and protection with some style for your tablet, cell phone, and other hand held devices with the accessories that support them. 
""Typically, bags currently on the market provide minimal protectionfor the laptop or tablet or if adequate protection is provided it makes the bagthick, heavy and bulky, the Fox Case Co. case offered improved protection for my laptop or tablet while maintaining their lightweight, slim design which was awelcomed innovation.""  Larry Glauser - President OMPC
My focus is to make life a bit easier for all of us...that focus went into every aspect of the case design from the external and internal pockets, to the wheeled luggage strap, and to the weight of the case. I have kept my cases as light as possible with a small to large range from less than 1 pound to just over 2 pounds.  
           Fashion-Fox                             Eco-Fox                                     Dura-Fox
   
Take your cell phone, other handheld devices, and the accessories to support them along with you in one clean simple case. Individual pockets for all the extras that you need to take along. The back pocket in the large case is sized for legal file folders and letter file folders in the medium case. 
 
                                                   
                                                   
 
I have chosen high quality, durable, and stylish hardware to ensure my cases stand the test of time. From metal zipper tabs to metal D rings and snap hooks.

<h3><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">This year Free Dominion, and we as individuals, must struggle with three trials. The precedents set in those trials will make or break the freedom of speech and open discourse on issues on the internet. We will be fighting: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">against Richard Warman and the National Post over whether quotes from a news article can be posted without violating copyright.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">the assertion by Warman and the NP that internet posts should not be subject to the same civil litigation time limitations that apply to publications in other media. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;""> the Baglow defamation case, which is important because the court asked us to  bring in expert witnesses to educate them on how defamation law should be applied to the internet.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">Finally, the long-awaited defamation case Warman vs. Free Dominion and John Does next September. The jury trial is set to last three weeks. We will incur many expenses including flying David Icke from the UK to address the truth of the allegations of Richard Warman’s campaign against him.</span></li>
</ul><h3><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">There is a lot riding on these court cases</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">The outcomes will have profound effects on anyone using the Internet or engaged in the new media whether as a forum participant, blogger, site operator, news aggregator or an e-mail forums operator. Many other institutions and people are involved - schools, universities, libraries, teachers, students, researchers and anyone else who uses the internet to access information and articles for use in their discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">Good decisions will mean the end of frivolous defamation suits and relief from the “libel chill” that has stifled discussion on blogs and forums over the past several years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">We are eagerly anticipating a full trial on all of the issues of Richard Warman’s reputation in front of a jury of our peers. Since he has sued or threatened to sue over eighty people for discussing these issues, a ruling in our favour will be extremely important to our freedom of political discourse and speech.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;""><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">How you can join the fight</span></span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">This year will cost us tens of thousands of dollars, but we are confident that we can represent your interests in court and we can win! This will be our most expensive year to date.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;""> </span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our lawfare opponents have been bragging that we will not be able to raise enough money to get these cases to trial.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">We think that they are wrong about our support and further, that they are afraid that their legal actions will not stand up in a court of law. </span></p>

This year Free Dominion, and we as individuals, must struggle with three trials. The precedents set in those trials will make or break the freedom of speech and open discourse on issues on the internet. We will be fighting: 

against Richard Warman and the National Post over whether quotes from a news article can be posted without violating copyright.
the assertion by Warman and the NP that internet posts should not be subject to the same civil litigation time limitations that apply to publications in other media. 
 the Baglow defamation case, which is important because the court asked us to  bring in expert witnesses to educate them on how defamation law should be applied to the internet.
Finally, the long-awaited defamation case Warman vs. Free Dominion and John Does next September. The jury trial is set to last three weeks. We will incur many expenses including flying David Icke from the UK to address the truth of the allegations of Richard Warman’s campaign against him.
There is a lot riding on these court cases
The outcomes will have profound effects on anyone using the Internet or engaged in the new media whether as a forum participant, blogger, site operator, news aggregator or an e-mail forums operator. Many other institutions and people are involved - schools, universities, libraries, teachers, students, researchers and anyone else who uses the internet to access information and articles for use in their discipline.
Good decisions will mean the end of frivolous defamation suits and relief from the “libel chill” that has stifled discussion on blogs and forums over the past several years.
We are eagerly anticipating a full trial on all of the issues of Richard Warman’s reputation in front of a jury of our peers. Since he has sued or threatened to sue over eighty people for discussing these issues, a ruling in our favour will be extremely important to our freedom of political discourse and speech.
How you can join the fight
This year will cost us tens of thousands of dollars, but we are confident that we can represent your interests in court and we can win! This will be our most expensive year to date.
 Our lawfare opponents have been bragging that we will not be able to raise enough money to get these cases to trial.
We think that they are wrong about our support and further, that they are afraid that their legal actions will not stand up in a court of law. 
Please help us by donating what you are able and, even if you can't donate, please pass this around to everyone you know who has an interest in issues of internet freedom.
If you have any ideas for increasing our reach, we would love to hear from you! E-mail defence@freedominion.ca.

Hello everyone. My name is Sergiu and my campaign is about important dates in everybody's life.
 Remembering someone's birthday or anniversary is a very polite thing to do, especially when it comes to friends and family. Birthday Lab (still working on the name) is an application which will remind you of your birthdays and things you can/usually forget. It will work on your computer, your smartphone or tablet, can be installed on your web server to send notifications by email or SMS and synchronize data between them.
 This is going to be a great pack of “forget-me-not” applications running on any platform and extremely useful for busy people, old people, people who forget, people who don't want to bother their mind with additional information, companies which want to automatically congratulate their customers by email, but also for people who just want to manage their life events in an easier way. I invite you to read below and find out more about this set of applications.
 
Is this application for you?

Did you ever forget the birthday of your mother (father, sister, aunt, etc.)?
Did you ever forget the wedding anniversary or the first meeting date with your soul mate?
Did you ever forget to pay the debt to the bank for previous months?
Did you ever forget to pass technical inspection of the car and now you get a penalty?
Did you ever forget to make the annual consultations at the dentist?
Human brain tends to forget things (sometimes this process is even beneficial), but what to do with those things you don't need to keep in mind right now, but will need them later?
As a solution I got the idea of making a universal application that will run on any device that is used in the everyday life and will help people to manage the birthdays, anniversaries and important events. If you answered YES to any of the questions above, then this application is for you too.
 
Why Birthday Lab?
There are a lot of similar applications out there, but Birthday Lab will be the best option because there is no universal and cross-platform application which runs on any device you use. It will be easy to use by everybody and you will be always informed no matter where you are.
This app can be used as birthday and anniversary reminder tool for you and your family, as an appointment internal service for a company or as reminder tool for a community members. People will be able to use our dedicated server to store their contacts and set up reminders or will be able to install the web application on their personal server to use it privately.
 
What we have at the moment?
 I developed my first similar application back in 2007, when I made a Desktop application designed to remind people of their birthdays. About 2 years ago I launched a Web-based application that sends an email to the people with important information they don't want to forget. However as the application grows, people are sending letters demanding more features and some of the requirements that would be useful need time and investment. Unfortunately, at the moment the development can be done only in my free time that's why the progress is slow, but if the project will be successfully funded I will be able to devote all my time to the application development.

As I previously said at the moment we have already made a basic version of the Desktop Application, which can be downloaded at: http://www.ss-birthdayreminder.com. Unfortunately, this application version is not free and it doesn't include many features that need to be integrated. But based on the existing code will be written a new application that will be free and open source.
Even though it's still a light app, it was featured on popular websites like: Quixey, FindMySoft, CNET Download, Brothersoft, Softpedia, Softonic, Download 3000, Windows 7 Download and others. 

Also a basic version of the Web Application is available at http://www.birthdaylab.com which is free for all users, but unfortunately it doesn't contain all the advantages that need to be integrated, such as SMS notifications, notifications sharing, automatic sending of congratulation emails, birthday wishes list, and much more. It's going to be a very complex and feature rich application.
 This app was mentioned too on popular websites like: MakeUseOf, MadrasGeek, Quixey, CNET Download and others.
  
What we'll do in the end?
In the end, this application will be a pack of other 3 applications:


Desktop version. This version will be a handy application that will allow you to store people's birthdays in a sort of database and inform you of upcoming events a few days in advance. The program comes with two tools: Birthday Manager and Checker. The manager is where you store people's data, including as much information as you want; and the checker is the one that informs you of upcoming birthdays displaying a little message from the system tray. You can customize the visible fields and have the ability to generate reports on the latest birthdays whenever you want.

In addition to this, the program features a nice and intuitive user interface that anyone can use. So if you don't have such a good memory and are always disappointing people because you never remember their birthdays, this is going to be a useful tool for you to have. Desktop version will be available for the following platforms: Windows, Linux and MacOS.



Web version. This application will run on a web server and will send alerts via email and/or SMS to users, who will be able to manage the birthdays, anniversaries and events from the web interface and a cronjob which will run every hour will send notifications in the respective day at the desired hour, depending on the user's time zone.

These notifications can be shared with others, for example, wives will be able to share with their husbands the anniversaries that they always forget. In addition, this application will allow you to automatically send congrats using predefined templates, feature to be used by companies or individuals that would like to congratulate their customers automatically. The application will be nice-looking on mobile devices screens and easy to use at the same.



Mobile version. The app will work on your smartphone or tablet, thus you will be able to manage your important dates or sync them with those added in Desktop or Web version. You will get an internal notification directly on your phone no matter where you are, so you will be informed all the time. At the beginning we're planning to have support for iPhone and Android devices, but we plan to add support for other devices too in the near future.

This set of applications will synchronize data online using a common database, allowing users to easily transfer the data from one application to another, keeping them up to date. Below you can find a visual diagram for a better understanding of how it will work:
 
  
When will it be completed?
Immediately after the successful funding we'll begin the work on the development in the following order:

May – project funding
June – July = PC application development and pre-release
July – September = Web application development and pre-release
September – November = Mobile application development and pre-release
December = Final testing and final release
 
What are the money for?
The total development process will take about 6 months and it will involve one designer, a developer and a tester to accomplish this. The amount necessary to complete this pack of applications is estimated at about 48,000 dollars. Each application will require the following amounts:

Desktop version [support on Windows, Linux and MacOS] – 9k USD
Web version [with sync feature] – 15k USD
Mobile version [support on Apple devices + Android] – 21k USD
Final testing and release – 3k USD
Even though the Desktop and Mobile versions will be able to run standalone, the Web version and synchronization feature will require a host server to be able to run. After we release the open source code, we will provide a paid hosted service to make it easy for people who want to use the web version and sync feature, but don’t want to deal with the wag of setting the server up. We will make it easy to export your data so if you decide to install the server on your host you are free to do so at anytime.
Our goal is for everyone to be able to use the web version and sync feature and we think offering this service will be helpful to non-tech users who want to use them without setting up a host for this.
  
What are the risks and challenges?
This is a massive project and like every software development project, careful planning and great development skills are needed. I have spent years on developing applications and also I have dedicated a lot of time in developing of similar applications before. Now I need some time and your help to make one big and multi-platform application. With your support we will deliver the biggest reminder kit of open source applications running on any platform and helping people to not forget birthdays and events.

 Like popular app Yo, Meow is a zero-character messaging tool. Simply select a contact, and Meow sends them a ""Meow."" But unlike Yo, and its Game of Thrones-inspired cousin Hodor, Meow also sends your friend a Creative Commons-licensed image of a cat. It's that easy!   What We Need & What You Get 
We have the idea. What we need now is funding to build the actual app. Funds will be used to pay a developer directly; any additional funds will be spent on marketing for the app and creating new features to make the app more (cat) fancy.
Donors will receive early beta access to the app and a wider selection of initial cat photos as perks!


  The Impact Cats make people happy. By contributing to an app that sends cat images between friends, you are making people happy.

</div><h1><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Summary</span></h1><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The 7Seg display for Raspberry Pi is a simple kit for
people of all ages.  It serves well as
both an introduction to soldering, and an introduction to using the GPIO on the
Raspberry Pi.  It enables you to output
numbers to a display on top of your Pi, this could be used to display anything,
from the number of emails in your inbox, to using it as a digital dice.  The kit includes all of the components, and
the PCB (Circuit Board), necessary to communicate with and drive the 7Seg display.  It also has a small form factor, which fits
neatly across the bottom of the Raspberry Pi.  The displays will be available in green or red LEDs, which we will confirm in an email after the project's completion.  There will also be a good selection of  comprehensive </span>tutorials<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> available at <a href=""http://7seg.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://7seg.co.uk</a>.</span><br/></p>
<h1>Concept</h1>
<p>The idea first came about when I was thinking about a new
project.  I wanted to be able to display
my score from a game which I was playing on the Pi onto a 7-Seg display.  I started using a breadboard to do this, but I
soon ended up with a rather large setup. 
The 7Seg for Raspberry Pi makes this amazingly simple and compact, so
anyone, no matter how inexperienced can easily and neatly output numbers to an
LED display.</p>
<h1>Is It Suitable For Me?</h1>
<p>The 7Seg for Raspberry Pi has been designed from the ground
up to be accessible to people of all ages and abilities.  The kit uses high quility components, and uses gold plated PCBs to help make soldering easy.  All you need to get started is the kit, a
soldering iron, a length of solder, and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h4>Will any soldering Iron be OK?</h4>
<p>YES! This kit uses components suitable for anyone to solder.  Here are some suitable soldering irons:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The design uses the 40110 driver IC to simplify
communication with the 7Seg.  It also
has several jumpers, which under the recommended setup would be closed.  However, when removed, this enables the user
to change the GPIOs which control the display. 
The design has evolved though several iterations, and we are currently
awaiting the next batch.</p>
<h1>Uses</h1>
<p>Despite its apparent simplicity, there are tons of uses for
something like the 7Seg.  Here are just
some of the ones which I have managed to think up:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Dice</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Game score display</span><br/>

</li>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Count down timer</span><br/>

</ul><p></p>

<p>
</p><p>After receipt of the money from Indiegogo, we hope to have
the circuit boards produced, and received in approximately 3 weeks.  During this time, I will order and receive the
individual components, which I will then package in preparation for the arrival
of the circuit boards.  Once all of the
parts have arrived, I will complete the packaging and send the 7Segs</p>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Well, I am a 16 year old student, who is currently studying Further
Maths, Physics and Electronics at A-Level. 
Out of school, I have been interested in electronics for many years, I

SummaryThe 7Seg display for Raspberry Pi is a simple kit for
people of all ages.  It serves well as
both an introduction to soldering, and an introduction to using the GPIO on the
Raspberry Pi.  It enables you to output
numbers to a display on top of your Pi, this could be used to display anything,
from the number of emails in your inbox, to using it as a digital dice.  The kit includes all of the components, and
the PCB (Circuit Board), necessary to communicate with and drive the 7Seg display.  It also has a small form factor, which fits
neatly across the bottom of the Raspberry Pi.  The displays will be available in green or red LEDs, which we will confirm in an email after the project's completion.  There will also be a good selection of  comprehensive tutorials available at http://7seg.co.uk.
Concept
The idea first came about when I was thinking about a new
project.  I wanted to be able to display
my score from a game which I was playing on the Pi onto a 7-Seg display.  I started using a breadboard to do this, but I
soon ended up with a rather large setup. 
The 7Seg for Raspberry Pi makes this amazingly simple and compact, so
anyone, no matter how inexperienced can easily and neatly output numbers to an
LED display.
Is It Suitable For Me?
The 7Seg for Raspberry Pi has been designed from the ground
up to be accessible to people of all ages and abilities.  The kit uses high quility components, and uses gold plated PCBs to help make soldering easy.  All you need to get started is the kit, a
soldering iron, a length of solder, and a Raspberry Pi.
Will any soldering Iron be OK?
YES! This kit uses components suitable for anyone to solder.  Here are some suitable soldering irons:
Draper
Soldering Iron Kit
Silverline
Soldering Iron (Iron only)InstructionsWhat Goes WhereWe are currently working on a neat, and easy to follow instruction set.  This will be available on-line before you receive your kits.  These will guide you through the soldering process, and some example projects.  Using 7SegThe 7Seg should be compatible with any program on the Raspberry Pi which can access the GPIO.  This means you can use absolutely anything, from Scratch, to a simple script with a web interface.  Again, we will try to make as many mini tutorials as possible, but as with anything, we are sure that the community will come up with loads more ideas.  Please take a look at a few tutorials we already have up over at http://7seg.co.ukPhotos
Design

The design uses the 40110 driver IC to simplify
communication with the 7Seg.  It also
has several jumpers, which under the recommended setup would be closed.  However, when removed, this enables the user
to change the GPIOs which control the display. 
The design has evolved though several iterations, and we are currently
awaiting the next batch.
Uses
Despite its apparent simplicity, there are tons of uses for
something like the 7Seg.  Here are just
some of the ones which I have managed to think up:


Dice


Game score display


Email notifier


Count down timer


Timeline

After receipt of the money from Indiegogo, we hope to have
the circuit boards produced, and received in approximately 3 weeks.  During this time, I will order and receive the
individual components, which I will then package in preparation for the arrival
of the circuit boards.  Once all of the
parts have arrived, I will complete the packaging and send the 7Segs
About Me
Well, I am a 16 year old student, who is currently studying Further
Maths, Physics and Electronics at A-Level. 
Out of school, I have been interested in electronics for many years, I
have many small projects and a few larger ones including the toroCam (http://torocam.com).  I have also backed many projects on other crowd
funding websites such as Kickstarter, which I think gives me a good insight
into what backers want, and how to keep everyone up to date.ShippingFree shipping within the UK is included on all reward levels.  Outside of the UK we are happy to accept other backers, however I would appreciate it if you would please contact me first, in order to arrange the potential extra surcharge for shipping.  In most cases I am sure this will be very small, and I will endeavour to help you!Share It!Please share the project with friends and family - the more people that know about it the better!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>As many indiegogoers request, we are starting this follow-up campaign. The purpose of this campaign is to give many of you who missed out on the first one the chance to hop in, and to give original backers a way to add funds for shipping or choose additional perks.

<p>However, we still feel not good to let all first round backers wait for Aug 30 delivering. We made a very very tough decision:</p>
<p><b>CASE Remote will be online sale in September after second round indiegogo campaign. There will be two types of products: CASE Remote basic package ($99 as promised) and CASE Remote kit package ($129). We decided to ship all backers in the two round indiegogo campaign with CASE Remote kit package. We hope this decision can make everyone's waiting worthwhile</b><br/></p>

<p>CASE Remote is a solid product. We have demonstrated this with our prototype. We also finished most of mass production. So the risk of this campaign is very low. <br/></p>

Then a professional testing firm that specialized in testing of all smartphones and smartwatches for major brands took over to do the testing. They tested material and components that are used in the MADICE SMART PAIR as well as the working prototypes that are used for such testing. Then, the smartwatch manufacturer that we’ve selected assembled everything together for us to make the working prototype that can be eventually used for mass production.

</p><p></p><p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p><p>We have been working on tech related hardware and software development over the last ten years. One year ago, we dedicated our life to the MADICE project.</p><p>We took the risk to invest with our own money and time in our invention with the determination that we’ll overcome any difficulties to bring MADICE SMART PAIR into reality.</p><p>Making a smartwatch or a smartcamera is relatively easy. The hardest part is to balance the elements of art, fashion and innovation. It took us eight months to get the final prototype of the SMART PAIR from our first concept drawing. We spent another three months to test the hardware and start building software. We did it all by ourselves without any third party financing.</p><p>We want to make the best product we would feel proud to use, so we've decided to use sapphire glass and titanium casing for the SMART PAIR as we planned. However, the supplier of the materials needs a minimum order. So we have to set up stretch goals. If we are able to raise $100,000 on Indiegogo, we will be able to make the SMART PAIR with the materials we love.</p><p>Our quality control will be uncompromised. Each component will be tested to make sure it functions perfectly to be allowed to be part of MADICE. So, there could be unforeseen issues such as delays in delivery because high-end parts are from different major channels of suppliers and there will be a lot of coordination between manufactures, suppliers, and delivery companies.</p><p>We understand the risks and we’re confident that with your support here, we can meet the challenges because we believe in community, we believe in innovation and we believe in Indiegogo.</p><p></p><p><b>FAQ</b></p>

So, we have come up with a diagram to show the difference. MADICE SMART PAIR is designed in New York by a team of innovative artists and designers led by MADICE creator and founder Stone, an artist, musician, multimedia and technology entrepreneur. As a passionate artist and perfectionist, Stone devoted his expertise, knowledge and lifetime experience to the making of MADICE. From day one, MADICE teams have a single goal; to create the most powerful and most visually striking and functioning device. Our design team in New York and our engineering team and testing firm in Shenzhen China worked together as one. We pushed each other’s limits and went through many different designs and physical shapes from conception to actual product until we reached the point of epiphany.Led by Jacky Pu, a very experienced industrial designer and developer of smart wearable devices, the engineering team started testing key components and working on the mockups and prototypes. Then a professional testing firm that specialized in testing of all smartphones and smartwatches for major brands took over to do the testing. They tested material and components that are used in the MADICE SMART PAIR as well as the working prototypes that are used for such testing. Then, the smartwatch manufacturer that we’ve selected assembled everything together for us to make the working prototype that can be eventually used for mass production. We paid for mockups, tooling, testing procedures and all different kinds of functional engineering prototypes to make sure that the working prototype we finally got can be used for mass production.  We come to Indiegogo out of our respect for its community where people get together to support original, artistic and innovative projects. Together we can change the world.We are committed to building up MADICE as a brand with a vision. We have long term goals and want to achieve that vision one project at a time starting with MADICE SMART PAIR. MADICE Smart Pair is not just a smartwatch and camera, it becomes the personal statement the minute you put it on your wrist. In order to achieve the minimalist style, we use the best materials available for smart wearable devices such as sapphire glass and titanium casing. We went through so many rounds of design, component testing, software comparisons and material selection with only one single goal in mind; which is to make the best smartwatch and smartcamera on the market. We want something so original that all of us would feel proud to wear it on our wrists.We currently have a working prototype of the MADICE SMART PAIR that works as shown. Within the smart pair, the circuit boards for Power and Bluetooth have been completed and installed. However, we need to meet volume order requirements for the touch screen. The manufacturing of MADICE SMART PAIR will become feasible and the cost becomes much less expensive when we meet volume order requirements for the components and materials.  We have several engineering prototypes that we’ve carefully refined and we’re nearly ready to begin mass production. This means all we need is to have a certain number of SMART PAIR spoken for before we can begin the process of manufacturing.The prototypes currently work with our early stage beta app that allows us to test our prototypes and make sure they work correctly. The MADICE official app for both Android and IOS are currently in the preliminary stages of development.Our manufacturing partner (BO DAO Electronic Ltd. Co.) is based in Shenzhen, China, and is able to produce all of our components in house. With over 15 years of experience manufacturing electronic home appliances for fortune 500 companies and nearly eight years manufacturing smart devices including smartphones and smartwatches, they are proficient at producing high volume orders quickly, so they will be able to make as many units as we need.We named MADICE SMART PAIR with a double meaning: we all are smart pairs for each other, and together we can make smart decisions and choices in life. Please pledge your support regardless of the amount. We are thrilled to be on Indiegogo to present you with the best product we have ever invested in and invented with the best of our knowledge, experience and talents.MADICE T-SHIRT & SPORTS CAPSpecial ThanksWe would love to thank our family, friends, and everyone who has contributed their valuable time and work to our journey.

Risks and ChallengesWe have been working on tech related hardware and software development over the last ten years. One year ago, we dedicated our life to the MADICE project.We took the risk to invest with our own money and time in our invention with the determination that we’ll overcome any difficulties to bring MADICE SMART PAIR into reality.Making a smartwatch or a smartcamera is relatively easy. The hardest part is to balance the elements of art, fashion and innovation. It took us eight months to get the final prototype of the SMART PAIR from our first concept drawing. We spent another three months to test the hardware and start building software. We did it all by ourselves without any third party financing.We want to make the best product we would feel proud to use, so we've decided to use sapphire glass and titanium casing for the SMART PAIR as we planned. However, the supplier of the materials needs a minimum order. So we have to set up stretch goals. If we are able to raise $100,000 on Indiegogo, we will be able to make the SMART PAIR with the materials we love.Our quality control will be uncompromised. Each component will be tested to make sure it functions perfectly to be allowed to be part of MADICE. So, there could be unforeseen issues such as delays in delivery because high-end parts are from different major channels of suppliers and there will be a lot of coordination between manufactures, suppliers, and delivery companies.We understand the risks and we’re confident that with your support here, we can meet the challenges because we believe in community, we believe in innovation and we believe in Indiegogo.FAQ

<h1><strong>About Us</strong></h1>
<p>Earlier this year I started Voto Studios, a media production company, with my brother. Since then we have added more business partners into our team. One of us had an idea for a tablet stand in the round shape of a donut. We though it would be easy to market so we moved forward with the idea. This is my frist time taking part in the creation of a product like this. The work has been challenging because finding the right manufacture is tough work. The grooves in the Donut™ make it difficult to make. In the curing process we found that time and time again the model would deform and could not work as a practical stand. Luckily we have found great manufacturing partners here in Fresno that have put a lot of work into this product. With your help we can keep the Donut™ made here in the USA. </p>

Are you going camping? Then use SleeperCell to open that bottle or suds, open that can of food, start a fire with the flint, blow the whistle if you're in trouble or navigate with the compass.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">The possibilities for what SleeperCell can do for you are truly endless - and with your help you can bring this versatile product to the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">My name is Robert Pattison and I invented SleeperCell because I love the function of my multitool - but never had it around when I needed it. Not only will you be pre-ordering a strong and lightweight smartphone case - you will be ordering a product that's there whenever you need it. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">Now that you've had a moment to think of all the useful applications that SleeperCell can do for you - now think of all the family members that would benefit from your generous pledges!

Twenty-five million Boy Scouts can't be wrong when they say...""Be Prepared."" What's the first thing anyone goes for when they're in an accident...their phone! It's one of very few items that will be close by when something happens. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">Like most projects on this site, I need your help to cover the HUGE cost of manufacturing and production runs. I have manufacturers lined up and ready to begin as soon as I rally the community around this project. With your generous pledges - you'll be pre-ordering as many units as you like. There are several levels to show your support.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">I realize that times are tough and people are saving as much as they can and whenever they can. Believe me - I can certainly appreciate that and hope that you will not only pledge what you can - but help me spread the word about this project. The faster I get this project - the faster I can send out your SleeperCells before the holidays. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">I realize that I'm asking for a lot of money to fund my project and get SleeperCell off the ground but there are several components that build this hefty price tag. </span></p>

Twenty-five million Boy Scouts can't be wrong when they say...""Be Prepared."" What's the first thing anyone goes for when they're in an accident...their phone! It's one of very few items that will be close by when something happens. 
Like most projects on this site, I need your help to cover the HUGE cost of manufacturing and production runs. I have manufacturers lined up and ready to begin as soon as I rally the community around this project. With your generous pledges - you'll be pre-ordering as many units as you like. There are several levels to show your support.
I realize that times are tough and people are saving as much as they can and whenever they can. Believe me - I can certainly appreciate that and hope that you will not only pledge what you can - but help me spread the word about this project. The faster I get this project - the faster I can send out your SleeperCells before the holidays. 
I realize that I'm asking for a lot of money to fund my project and get SleeperCell off the ground but there are several components that build this hefty price tag. 
Manufacturing Costs, Tooling, Minimum Order Quantities, Shipping, Import and Duty Fees, Storage, Taxes, Credit Card Processing Fess and Indiegogo gets a percentage too. 
If you like this product and see the potential for future versions PLEASE help me get fund this business! Thank you for ALL your support!!!!

<p>Now we have
a fully working prototype built from final selected components, but some things
need improvements. We plan to use the most appropriated mass production methods
for packing manufacturing, manual creation and implement some software improvements.<span>  The first $40,000 will help us to obtain
enough money to be able to get LUMINO ready for production. Obviously
larger  amounts allow us to produce more
devices at rates much lower than future retail prices. That is why any
contribution is quite important.  We will
start shipping in the latter part of<strong></strong> December 2014. We do not know the volume of items to be
sent already, so now we cannot be exact when all products should be sent. Most
of the production facilities are capable of making about 1000 kits within 1
month. Upon successful completion of the campaign, follow the updates on this

Impressive
effect on top of an impressive design
Contemporary monitors and TV are modernly designed. Therefore, LUMINO
has to be designed in a modern and minimalistic style as well. We focused to
design as fine a device as possible, because we know that the distance between
the wall and a screen is often small. With a semi-transparent case you can
watch how the advanced technology works to provide great impressions. The little red LED inside the device informs about controller activity.

Where will the funds go







Production
schedule
Now we have
a fully working prototype built from final selected components, but some things
need improvements. We plan to use the most appropriated mass production methods
for packing manufacturing, manual creation and implement some software improvements.  The first $40,000 will help us to obtain
enough money to be able to get LUMINO ready for production. Obviously
larger  amounts allow us to produce more
devices at rates much lower than future retail prices. That is why any
contribution is quite important.  We will
start shipping in the latter part of December 2014. We do not know the volume of items to be
sent already, so now we cannot be exact when all products should be sent. Most
of the production facilities are capable of making about 1000 kits within 1
month. Upon successful completion of the campaign, follow the updates on this
page or our social media.
 LUMINO kit includes:

LUMINO controller box


Zip ties with adhesive mounting base

10 x digital RGB LED Strips which you choose in perk

5V power supply (110-240V) with EU/US/UK/AU plug

Micro USB cable

User guide and warranty



GalleryWhere we ship

Everywhere. Free priority shipping for all backers regardless of the
destination.  Local import taxes may
apply. Depending on your location we include an appropriate power plug adapter (EU/US/UK/AU)
and a warranty card with a 1 year period.About us

<p>Based on the dynamics of neuroplasticity, our WizeWell team has been researching new psychological tools that actively relieve stress, stimulate innovative thinking, and encourage heartfelt relating. Drawing on insights from perceptual psychology, mindfulness meditation, and neurobiology, we’ve developed a cognitive process that enables people to step by step transform mental and emotional habits, and shift at will into preferred mindsets.<strong>     </strong></p>

<h1>Breather Breaks &amp; Focus Phrases</h1>
<p>The human brain has four equally-important functions – but we tend to fixate overmuch on the mental deductive-thinking function. The WizeWell App provides a process for periodically shifting out of cognition mode into wholebody sensation mode, and then entering into optimum mindsets for accomplishing the goal at hand. After a bit of practice, this mindset shifting can happen in just 2 minutes.</p>
<p>The first week of our app program delivers training and daily reinforcement for temporarily quieting the mental chatter that usually dominates our minds. Then, in this quiet-mind state, the user is in optimum position to shift into whole-brain integrative mindsets and access new insights, trustworthy decisions, and deeper relating. This is a scientifically-grounded process for shifting confidently into ‘the zone’ whenever you want to. <a href=""http://wizewell.com/experience-wizewell.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""4-Part-Brain""><img alt=""4-Part-Brain"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/515/409/bfb72f548e69d4f0ea6185497739d382_large.jpg?1365988891"" src="""" style="""" title=""4-Part-Brain""/></a></p>
<p>During the 8-week WizeWell training period, users are guided through daily Breather Breaks where they use special Focus Phrases to elicit positive shifts in focus and experience. Via our WizeWell App, five new Focus Phrases are introduced each week related to a particular theme.</p>
<p><strong>                                                  </strong></p>
<h1>Interactive Design Specifics</h1>
<p>Traditionally the major difficulty in developing more rewarding mental and emotional habits has been the lack of periodic environmental reminders and 24/7 reinforcement strategies. The patent-pending WizeWell App resolves this dilemma using mobile platforms to deliver periodic cognitive guidance and self-regulated reinforcement schedules.</p>
<p><strong> <a href=""http://wizewell.com/experience-wizewell.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""App Flow Chart Link""><img alt=""App Flow Chart"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/515/407/07a77634949451f78553aeeee1af1721_large.jpg?1365988668"" src="""" style="""" title=""App Flow Chart""/></a></strong> </p>
<p>The basic schematic above includes the following elements:</p>
<p><strong>1: Daily Program:</strong><strong> </strong>For each of the 40 daily sessions, the app delivers the following: a Focus Phrase and picture, three short audio programs, and a text/discussion page.</p>
<p><strong>2: Mood Management Scale:</strong><strong> </strong>To be developed in round 2, this is an interactive system that, in just a minute or two, provides feedback and insight into your current mood, and gives suggestions on how best to modify your mood using our various programs.</p>
<p><strong>3: Breath Modification Bar:</strong> Our app offers a visual bar that moves back and forth to simulate inhaling and exhaling. Click on the bar to speed up or slow down its ‘breathing’ speed – and effortlessly modify your breathing so that it’s more smooth, deep, rhythmic and enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>4: Random Reinforcement: </strong>In the spirit of synchronicity, spin the WizeWell Roulette wheel and instantly receive a randomly-chosen Focus Phrase card on your screen – or listen to the related audio experience.</p>
<p><strong>5: WizeWell Videos: </strong>For each of our 8 weekly themes, we’ve produced a short video that guides you through that theme’s 5 Focus Phrases. Just click – and tap into this effortless audio-visual guidance.</p>
<p><strong>6: Emotional First Aid: </strong>There are four negative emotions that we all sometimes get stuck in. This dimension of the WizeWell App offers audio and video guidance for shifting out of negative moods into a more positive emotional experience.</p>
<p><strong>7: Archives: </strong>Whenever you want to, go to this menu and re-experience any of the written, audio, or video content you’ve encountered thusfar in the WizeWell Process.</p>
<p><strong>8: Settings:</strong> This offers the standard set of user choices for this type of app.</p>
<p><strong>9: Periodic Reminders:</strong> Enjoy full control of how you use this app to remind you to pause and take a short Breather Break – select how often you want a reminder, plus choose visual, audio, sound, or vibration reminder formats.</p>
<p><strong>10:  Biofeedback Plugins:</strong> We offer a list of biofeedback programs that you might want to add to the WizeWell program. In future versions we’ll build some of these directly into the app.</p>
<p><strong>11: Self-Monitoring Metrics:</strong><strong> </strong>We’re currently researching a number of ways to help you self-monitor your progress on a number of cognitive, emotional and performance scales. In round 2 we’ll be introducing these helpful metrics.</p>

and Juwan Nicholson and we are here to
tell you about our upcoming app “Closed Caption!”  As you
can probably relate, sometimes finding that perfect caption for your photo is
not as easy as it seems.  That is why we
have created “Closed Caption,” and now anyone can caption his or her photos with
ease.  “Closed Caption” is an application
to aid Instagram, Twitter and Facebook users with creating great captions for
their picture and posts. On occasions, a person will gain writers block when
uploading their photo onto social media. With that, our app will generate
captions they can use in their time of need.  </p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to reach
like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in exchange for early access
and rewards, and we also want to spread the word.  The more people we can get using “Closed
Caption” the more functional and successful it will be.  So this campaign will give you the basics on
our efforts and progress.  Beyond that we
encourage you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed “Closed Caption” for your
benefit, so enjoy!  We believe we are
really onto an easier way to caption every photo with a fraction of the work.</p><p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Do you ever think about what you want to

<p><b><i>Do you want to get help for your
writer’s block?</i></b></p>
<p><i><b>Have you ever taken a great photo, but
get stumped when thinking of a caption? </b></i></p>
<p>If you answered “Yes” to any of these
questions, you may want to keep reading… All you have to do is upload your
picture, and we will take it from there! With a range of categories to choose
from you'll be sure to have great captions in no time!</p>
<p>We have successfully created a platform
that solves a simple daily problem: writers block on social media. With our
flawless design and innovative writing solution we have made a platform that is
as essential as the social media it controls. 
We design every caption with an undying commitment to excellence and we
strive to make every caption better than the last.  We believe our dedication to quality will
differentiate ourselves and make us something you are proud to have captioning
your photos.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451333310/odo35qdgtengvtuwhg9n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Let Us

easy and fun!  “Closed Caption” allows
people to take advantage of mobile technology in the social media age. </p>
<p>Many people who follow their passion in
life cannot explain why or how they do it, but they find a way, no matter what.
And this is how I feel about my campaign. I am a ""teacher"" and

would give up.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451333341/kfovb7yhgi26puagojzq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>How Closed Caption is different?</b></p>
<p>With our expanding social
media culture, a social media presence is no longer a luxury it is a necessity.
When you own a social media account, in essence you own a brand for yourself.
From what you post, what you wear, how you interact with users, all of it is
monitored. It shows who you are as a person to your peers, and even to jobs. A
caption may not seem as important but it displays a lot about you without even
saying much. A caption can show a person’s wittiness, cunningness, and
personality. With that we are here to help! There have been instances where a
person garnered income, or employment through their profiles.  With that in mind, every facet of the account
matters. While there are apps out that can create videos, edit pictures, or add
more followers there is a noticeable defect in the writing aspect that comes
with it. The app is unique in which it aids users with an area that they
weren’t even aware needed improvement.</p>
<p><b>About Us</b></p>
<p>I am a recent graduate from the University of
Maryland Eastern Shore with a degree in sociology. I chose to take up this
major to learn more about human behavior, more importantly human interaction
through communication. Upon graduation I chose to further my education by
pursuing a masters in IT/ Cyber Security. I wanted to combine the information
that I learned through sociology with IT to learn of communications through
technology. From the Eastern Shore I befriended my partner Juwan Nicholson who
was pursuing a degree in Journalism and Telecommunications. Upon noticing our
different paths of education we used it to our advantage to think of ways
together we could implement new ideas. With his concentration in writing, and
mine in human interaction we formulated the idea of Closed Caption. Noticing
the impact social media had on campus, we realized that beyond the classroom
there were other opportunities it could be effectively utilized. While out one
night we had a big problem social media users have today. After taking a really
great picture we realized we didn't have a caption for the picture. You may or
may not know but nowadays the caption determine if it gets the exposure the
user wanted. After asking other friends and social media users
would this invention be of any assistance we decided to put it into action.</p>
<p><i>COMING SOON
TO THE TEAM: YOU!</i></p>

and Juwan Nicholson and we are here to
tell you about our upcoming app “Closed Caption!”  As you
can probably relate, sometimes finding that perfect caption for your photo is
not as easy as it seems.  That is why we
have created “Closed Caption,” and now anyone can caption his or her photos with
ease.  “Closed Caption” is an application
to aid Instagram, Twitter and Facebook users with creating great captions for
their picture and posts. On occasions, a person will gain writers block when
uploading their photo onto social media. With that, our app will generate
captions they can use in their time of need.  
The goal of this campaign is to reach
like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in exchange for early access
and rewards, and we also want to spread the word.  The more people we can get using “Closed
Caption” the more functional and successful it will be.  So this campaign will give you the basics on
our efforts and progress.  Beyond that we
encourage you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed “Closed Caption” for your
benefit, so enjoy!  We believe we are
really onto an easier way to caption every photo with a fraction of the work.Do you ever think about what you want to
write for too long when you just need a quick and fun caption?
Do you want to get help for your
writer’s block?
Have you ever taken a great photo, but
get stumped when thinking of a caption? 
If you answered “Yes” to any of these
questions, you may want to keep reading… All you have to do is upload your
picture, and we will take it from there! With a range of categories to choose
from you'll be sure to have great captions in no time!
We have successfully created a platform
that solves a simple daily problem: writers block on social media. With our
flawless design and innovative writing solution we have made a platform that is
as essential as the social media it controls. 
We design every caption with an undying commitment to excellence and we
strive to make every caption better than the last.  We believe our dedication to quality will
differentiate ourselves and make us something you are proud to have captioning
your photos.Let Us
Put an End to Your Writer’s Block!
Welcome to the new and improved way to caption
your photos with the click of a button with “Closed Caption”.  We developed an application designed to make captioning
your photos a breeze. With our application you can make captioning your photos
easy and fun!  “Closed Caption” allows
people to take advantage of mobile technology in the social media age. 
Many people who follow their passion in
life cannot explain why or how they do it, but they find a way, no matter what.
And this is how I feel about my campaign. I am a ""teacher"" and
""caregiver.” It taught me strength and passion to persevere when many
would give up.How Closed Caption is different?
With our expanding social
media culture, a social media presence is no longer a luxury it is a necessity.
When you own a social media account, in essence you own a brand for yourself.
From what you post, what you wear, how you interact with users, all of it is
monitored. It shows who you are as a person to your peers, and even to jobs. A
caption may not seem as important but it displays a lot about you without even
saying much. A caption can show a person’s wittiness, cunningness, and
personality. With that we are here to help! There have been instances where a
person garnered income, or employment through their profiles.  With that in mind, every facet of the account
matters. While there are apps out that can create videos, edit pictures, or add
more followers there is a noticeable defect in the writing aspect that comes
with it. The app is unique in which it aids users with an area that they
weren’t even aware needed improvement.
About Us
I am a recent graduate from the University of
Maryland Eastern Shore with a degree in sociology. I chose to take up this
major to learn more about human behavior, more importantly human interaction
through communication. Upon graduation I chose to further my education by
pursuing a masters in IT/ Cyber Security. I wanted to combine the information
that I learned through sociology with IT to learn of communications through
technology. From the Eastern Shore I befriended my partner Juwan Nicholson who
was pursuing a degree in Journalism and Telecommunications. Upon noticing our
different paths of education we used it to our advantage to think of ways
together we could implement new ideas. With his concentration in writing, and
mine in human interaction we formulated the idea of Closed Caption. Noticing
the impact social media had on campus, we realized that beyond the classroom
there were other opportunities it could be effectively utilized. While out one
night we had a big problem social media users have today. After taking a really
great picture we realized we didn't have a caption for the picture. You may or
may not know but nowadays the caption determine if it gets the exposure the
user wanted. After asking other friends and social media users
would this invention be of any assistance we decided to put it into action.
COMING SOON

<p>Unlimited means you can use our platform without any limitations, including updates, push-notifications, in-app purchases. It doesn’t matter if you have 1 or 1000 apps, or if your app reached 100,000 downloads or more. You can send unlimited push-notifications to your users, but make sure you don’t spam them. Apple/Google/Amazon might pull your app off their store if you spam push-notifications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do I need a developer account?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You only need one if you plan to build  paid apps or use in-app purchases. You need a developer account to receive the money. ($99/Year for AppStore; $25/Lifetime for Google Play; $99/Year for Amazon Store)</p>
<p>If you plan to create just free apps or ad-monetized ones, we will publish them with our business developer accounts.</p>

Appsner is a mobile application builder platform that allows you to create your own native and HTML5 mobile apps for iOS, Android and Kindle devices without coding.
Using Appsner is really easy. You don't need to be an Xcode expert or a  developer to build your own iPhone/iPad/Android/Kindle application. Appsner allows you to simultaneously create, edit, and manage native iPhone, iPad, Android, Kindle and HTML5 mobile apps online.
 

You can start creating your app by choosing a template and adding content, pictures, music, sounds, videos. No worries about coding, algorithms, performance, data structures, memory management, memory leaks, multithreading, bugs, fixes, compatibility, SDKs, API and so on.
Appsner provides a set of online tools that empowers you to build and design mobile applications using HTML and CSS. It's a WYSIWYG html editor which simplifies design and development of mobile applications.
 Using Appsner doesn’t require any programming skills. We guarantee that anyone with zero knowledge of programming will be able to push all features provided to the max.

Having an app is kind of the ultimate in pull marketing. We are talking about the most intimate device in consumers’ lives. It’s always on. They carry it with them. When consumers put a branded app on their phone, they’re inviting you into an ongoing conversation and to have a presence on a device that’s so intimate. That’s one of the things that makes it attractive for any company, business and individual. It’s a great way to stay connected with the audience and to carry on a longer conversation.

Our platform is almost ready, and everything we’ve presented until now is already developed.
We’ve put a lot of effort and passion into this so we look forward to finish what we’ve started!
$7000 is the amount we estimated we need in order to have a proper launch, provide a quality service and support. Most of the money will be spent on a powerful server to host the platform online and the apps. The rest will be used to finish our website integration that is currently under development.
We hope we can reach our goal!
UPDATE: We've managed to secure $3,000 in funds from local businesses, so our new goal is $4,000.

<h2>FlashQ Key Features</h2>
<h4>Compact and Stylish</h4>
<p>This little cube design makes FlashQ fit in any cameras with standard ISO hot shoe. Its stylish outlook perfectly matches with your camera.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/869686/files/20140919212922-NPP_3.jpg?1411187362"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Simple User Interface</h4>
<p>Both FlashQ transmitter and receiver get the same user interface: 2 buttons and 1 tri-color LED indicator.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/869646/files/20140919205839-PB12.jpg?1411185519"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Automatic Clear Channel Selection &amp; Simple Pair-up</h4>
<p>Thanks to our software folks, make it smart and simple.</p>
<p>With a bulk of channels for selection, system can help to choose a clean channel. At the same time, we can avoid collision with other wireless system in the same frequency band.</p>
<p>FlashQ system can support up to 8 receivers simultaneously, provided that those receivers had been paired up with the transmitter. This gives the scalability of multiple wireless flashes and makes your photography more creative.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/869649/files/20140919205939-cartoon3b.jpg?1411185579"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Cold Shoe Adopter for FlashQ Receiver</h4>
<p>A cold shoe adopter is available for FlashQ receiver. This adopter makes the remote flash gets setup or positioning easily. The 1/4“ screw threads underneath adopter provides another option for tripod mount.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/869652/files/20140919210029-PB01.jpg?1411185629"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Sync Cord Output Available </h4>
<p>FlashQ receiver has a sync cord output via Func. Port (micro-USB form factor). The sync cord allows connection to the sync port of studio strobes or external flashes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/869655/files/20140919210058-PB09.jpg?1411185658"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<p>Additional sync cords are available now, including 1/4"" (6.35mm) / 2.5mm / 3.5mm phone plugs. These sync cord options make FlashQ easy to connect most studio strobes and flashes. <br/></p>

<h4>Back to Basic. No TTL</h4>
<p>FlashQ supports remote triggering flashes at sync speeds up to 1/250 sec*. The trigger signal is barely on the central contact of standard ISO hot shoe. No TTL information is transmitted by FlashQ. This makes FlashQ compatible with most camera and Flash brands.</p>

<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>FlashQ is the result of research and development by our leading engineering team in Hong Kong. We all share the mind: pushing the boundaries of innovation to create revolutionary products.</p>

FlashQ is a 2.4GHz Wireless Flash Trigger. It is the smallest wireless flash trigger ever and the perfect companion to Mirrorless and Prosumer Cameras. It works well with big SLR camera. Make the off-camera flash lighting possible at any angles and unleash the creativity in photographers.




How to Use FlashQ?


Attach FlashQ transmitter to your camera hot shoe on top, FlashQ receiver to a remote flash via hot shoe or sync cord, pair-up FlashQ device and start taking photos with endless possibilities of flash lighting.



Why FlashQ?
Interesting things inspire me to take photos whenever travelling or walking around in my city. Using my light-weight compact system camera makes everything possible. Have you even face a problem in finding a suitable wireless flash trigger? Most of them are large in size or not a good looking one. That's why my team starts to work this out.

FlashQ Key Features
Compact and Stylish
This little cube design makes FlashQ fit in any cameras with standard ISO hot shoe. Its stylish outlook perfectly matches with your camera.



Simple User Interface
Both FlashQ transmitter and receiver get the same user interface: 2 buttons and 1 tri-color LED indicator.

Automatic Clear Channel Selection & Simple Pair-up
Thanks to our software folks, make it smart and simple.
With a bulk of channels for selection, system can help to choose a clean channel. At the same time, we can avoid collision with other wireless system in the same frequency band.
FlashQ system can support up to 8 receivers simultaneously, provided that those receivers had been paired up with the transmitter. This gives the scalability of multiple wireless flashes and makes your photography more creative.

Cold Shoe Adopter for FlashQ Receiver
A cold shoe adopter is available for FlashQ receiver. This adopter makes the remote flash gets setup or positioning easily. The 1/4“ screw threads underneath adopter provides another option for tripod mount.

Sync Cord Output Available 
FlashQ receiver has a sync cord output via Func. Port (micro-USB form factor). The sync cord allows connection to the sync port of studio strobes or external flashes.




Additional sync cords are available now, including 1/4"" (6.35mm) / 2.5mm / 3.5mm phone plugs. These sync cord options make FlashQ easy to connect most studio strobes and flashes. 


Back to Basic. No TTL
FlashQ supports remote triggering flashes at sync speeds up to 1/250 sec*. The trigger signal is barely on the central contact of standard ISO hot shoe. No TTL information is transmitted by FlashQ. This makes FlashQ compatible with most camera and Flash brands.

Behind the Scenes
FlashQ is the result of research and development by our leading engineering team in Hong Kong. We all share the mind: pushing the boundaries of innovation to create revolutionary products.


Miniaturized internal antenna design puts FlashQ to be the first Wireless Flash Trigger product of its size in the world. The size is small, and the signal is strong. FlashQ can provide reliable wireless flash triggering, at any angles.

Proprietary energy-efficient protocol enables FlashQ to be the device with low power and low latency radio. Therefore, FlashQ transmitter / receiver is just powered by a CR2302 coin battery with 180 days standby time.

</span></p>
<p>Hello. I am Kiyomi Tagawa from the samurai.jp Association.</p>
<p>Japan is brimming with amazing artisans, artists, engineers, and researchers busying themselves day after day in a great diversity of pursuits including traditional culture, the arts, technology, and subculture. We need the support of the international community to bring their creative works and goods to life and to realize the fruits of their research. samurai.jp has just started the samurai.jp Project to rally widespread support in communicating Japan’s traditional values of hospitality and entertainment and the samurai spirit to the world.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For centuries, Japan has cultivated its own unique culture in such diverse areas as traditional dress, cuisine and architecture through to craftsmanship, the arts and performance. This culture continues to live and breathe within us. Yet in recent times, such values, and indeed recognition of the true value of this culture, are gradually being lost amid the inexorable tide of globalization.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p>
<p>By widely communicating the true value of Japan’s culture to people worldwide, we hope to facilitate more intense cultural, economic and international exchange through Japanese culture. We also hope to spark a rediscovery of Japan’s traditional cultural values among us, the people of Japan, as individuals.</p>
<p>The samurai.jp Project kicks off by profiling the completed prototype of a small-scale ring-shaped wind turbine built by Peace Frontier, a new company set to launch in October. We are seeking support via this Indiegogo campaign to enable conversion of the die-cast rotors used in the prototype into plastic, as a step toward commercializing the turbine. Through this installment of the project, in particular, we hope to use the development of this new product to help create employment and develop related businesses in the Tohoku region, which has suffered great hardship since the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We humbly ask for your support to help turn this revolutionary wind turbine into the future global standard in new natural energy technology.</p>

<h3>Developer Greetings</h3>
<p>
My
name is Tokio Fukui, and I’m a representative from Peace Frontier. For some
time, I was concerned about the drawbacks of conventional large propeller
generators, so I considered the development of a new type of wind power
generator that is environmentally friendly and can be installed with relative
ease even in urban areas. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The prototype
machines currently use die-cast rotors, but the current request for assistance
is to develop plastic rotors. To make the rotors lighter and increase their
power output, the wind power generators will use plastic rotors when they are
released as commercial products. This will make their transport simpler and
enable many people to use easy to operate wind power generators in various
environments. We hope you will support our efforts to spread wind power
generators that fully utilize the gifts of nature.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Wind, an inexhaustible source of energy that comes with no worries about depletion</h4>
<p>There is significant potential for the effective use of wind power, but there are also many problems. With horizontal shaft (propeller) power generation, as the surface area that receives wind power is enlarged, concerns arise from the perspective of strength, and when the rotational speed is increased, accidents with birds become a problem. On the other hand, if the speed is decreased, the problem of low frequency noise also occurs. With vertical shaft (gyromill) power generation, there are problems with safety and countermeasures to deal with strong winds, and compared to the scale, the power generation efficiency is low. In addition, power is not generated when the wind speed is slow, and the rated wind speed of small and medium size wind power generators is around 12m/second.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Features of Ring Type Wind Turbine Generators</span></h4></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p>Ring type wind turbines are a type of wind power generator that narrows the path through which the wind passes to thereby increase the wind speed and improve power generation efficiency. Basically, this technology takes technology that is used in areas such as pumped-storage dams and applies it to wind. The most impressive feature is that power can be generated from a weak wind. In fact, ample power can be generated with a wind speed of 3-5m/second in urban areas. In addition, the equipment outputs almost no sound. Lastly, the structure is such that the blades are not exposed on the outside, so the equipment poses no danger to birds or humans.</p>

<h4>Ring Wind Turbine Development Concept</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>* With a weak wind force, the ring wind turbine can generate 5-10 times as much power compared to a wind turbine with the same bore diameter.</p>
<p>* The generator has no shafts or exterior parts, and it is lightweight.</p>
<p>* The dimensions allow installation in a 2-square-meter area, and therefore all the components can fit in an elevator.</p>
<p>* The vanes do not stick out, so it is safe for wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>* The battery is housed in a stand, so the equipment can function as an uninterruptable power supply as well.</p>
<p>* Rated output of 3kW (wind speed of 8m/second)</p>
<p>* The goal is to generate 10MW/h yearly (when 1.2kW/h is generated with an average wind speed of 6m/second).</p></span><p></p>
<p><br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></span>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27_law"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Betz’s Law</a>: The amount of power that can be generated from the wind is proportional to
the square of the rotor diameter and to the third power of the wind speed. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/115523/files/20131006002654-Betz_Image.png?1381044414"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>* Wind speed
can be accelerated by reducing the cross-sectional area of the wind turbine so
that it is smaller than the wind inlet port, and as a result, power can be
generated even with a weak wind.</p>
<p>* Structural
strength is increased by adopting a ring format for the wind turbine, and the
entire unit is made more lightweight including the drive area.</p>
<p>* Springs are
attached to the blades of the wind turbine to improve wind gust countermeasures
and wind power recovery efficiency. </p>
<p>* Exhaust
promoting blades are installed on the exhaust port side to improve exhaust
efficiency.</p>
<p>* Rectifying
blades are attached in the wind collecting port to draw in the wind.</p>
<p>* The
rectifying blades serve as a guard to keep out wildlife.</p>
<p>* The newest life extending device is attached to the battery so that battery does not need to be replaced.<br/></p>

<p>* When the cross sectional area is reduced to 1/5, the fluid speed is increased 5 times, and the amount of power that is generated is increased 25 times. Wind is accelerated 5 times by adopting a cross sectional area of 0.15-square-meter for the ring wind turbine relative to the 0.78-square-meter cross sectional area of the outer circumferential dome. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>* The energy when wind blows at a speed of 10m/second over an area of 1 square meter is approximately 1kW/h. According to the Betz limit, a maximum of 600W of energy can be converted, but when the mechanical efficiency is 50%, the energy becomes 300W.</p>
<p>
* With
the prototype this time, an output of 47W is expected with a wind speed of
2m/second. With a wind speed of 4m/second, the expected output increases to
376W, at 6m/second, it increases to 1,269W, at 8m/second, it increases to
3,008W, and at a wind speed of 10m/second, the expected output is 5,875W. </p></span><p></p>

The change in direction of the wind between the top and bottom of the blades results in a powerful counteraction. When the upper wind diverges due to the angle, lift is lost. The ideal shape is called a Zhukovsky blade, and dimples like those on golf balls are believed to be effective at preventing divergence. <br/></span></p>

<p>Lift is obtained from counteraction that changes the wind direction. In other words, the direction of the wind changes behind the blades. According to the Law of Continuity, if the amount of exhaust does not change in the same cross-sectional area but the direction changes, the wind speed increases in a triangular area direction. The wind speed is increased by further changing this direction using the rectifying blades, and a trailing vortex is thereby created. <br/></p></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p></p>

Method:</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Let
the energy when the wind blows at 10m/second over an area of 1 square meter be
1kW/h, the Betz limit be 60%, and the machine efficiency be 50%. (Ordinarily,
machine efficiency is 60~80%.) A 2m/second wind will accelerate 5 times inside
the dome, and the blade speed will become 10m/second.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>* Blade cross-sectional area x 1,000W x 0.6 x 0.5 = power generation capacity with wind speed of 2m/second</p>
<p>According to Betz’s Law, the amount of power generated is proportional to the third power of the wind speed.</p>
<p>* The third power of the quotient of wind speed divided by two x 2m power generation capacity = power generation capacity</p>

Hello. I am Kiyomi Tagawa from the samurai.jp Association.
Japan is brimming with amazing artisans, artists, engineers, and researchers busying themselves day after day in a great diversity of pursuits including traditional culture, the arts, technology, and subculture. We need the support of the international community to bring their creative works and goods to life and to realize the fruits of their research. samurai.jp has just started the samurai.jp Project to rally widespread support in communicating Japan’s traditional values of hospitality and entertainment and the samurai spirit to the world.
For centuries, Japan has cultivated its own unique culture in such diverse areas as traditional dress, cuisine and architecture through to craftsmanship, the arts and performance. This culture continues to live and breathe within us. Yet in recent times, such values, and indeed recognition of the true value of this culture, are gradually being lost amid the inexorable tide of globalization.


By widely communicating the true value of Japan’s culture to people worldwide, we hope to facilitate more intense cultural, economic and international exchange through Japanese culture. We also hope to spark a rediscovery of Japan’s traditional cultural values among us, the people of Japan, as individuals.
The samurai.jp Project kicks off by profiling the completed prototype of a small-scale ring-shaped wind turbine built by Peace Frontier, a new company set to launch in October. We are seeking support via this Indiegogo campaign to enable conversion of the die-cast rotors used in the prototype into plastic, as a step toward commercializing the turbine. Through this installment of the project, in particular, we hope to use the development of this new product to help create employment and develop related businesses in the Tohoku region, which has suffered great hardship since the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.


We humbly ask for your support to help turn this revolutionary wind turbine into the future global standard in new natural energy technology.

Interview with Developer Tsuneo Fukui




Developer Greetings

My
name is Tokio Fukui, and I’m a representative from Peace Frontier. For some
time, I was concerned about the drawbacks of conventional large propeller
generators, so I considered the development of a new type of wind power
generator that is environmentally friendly and can be installed with relative
ease even in urban areas. 


The prototype
machines currently use die-cast rotors, but the current request for assistance
is to develop plastic rotors. To make the rotors lighter and increase their
power output, the wind power generators will use plastic rotors when they are
released as commercial products. This will make their transport simpler and
enable many people to use easy to operate wind power generators in various
environments. We hope you will support our efforts to spread wind power
generators that fully utilize the gifts of nature.




Wind, an inexhaustible source of energy that comes with no worries about depletion
There is significant potential for the effective use of wind power, but there are also many problems. With horizontal shaft (propeller) power generation, as the surface area that receives wind power is enlarged, concerns arise from the perspective of strength, and when the rotational speed is increased, accidents with birds become a problem. On the other hand, if the speed is decreased, the problem of low frequency noise also occurs. With vertical shaft (gyromill) power generation, there are problems with safety and countermeasures to deal with strong winds, and compared to the scale, the power generation efficiency is low. In addition, power is not generated when the wind speed is slow, and the rated wind speed of small and medium size wind power generators is around 12m/second.

Features of Ring Type Wind Turbine GeneratorsRing type wind turbines are a type of wind power generator that narrows the path through which the wind passes to thereby increase the wind speed and improve power generation efficiency. Basically, this technology takes technology that is used in areas such as pumped-storage dams and applies it to wind. The most impressive feature is that power can be generated from a weak wind. In fact, ample power can be generated with a wind speed of 3-5m/second in urban areas. In addition, the equipment outputs almost no sound. Lastly, the structure is such that the blades are not exposed on the outside, so the equipment poses no danger to birds or humans.









Ring Wind Turbine Development Concept


* With a weak wind force, the ring wind turbine can generate 5-10 times as much power compared to a wind turbine with the same bore diameter.
* The generator has no shafts or exterior parts, and it is lightweight.
* The dimensions allow installation in a 2-square-meter area, and therefore all the components can fit in an elevator.
* The vanes do not stick out, so it is safe for wildlife and humans.
* The battery is housed in a stand, so the equipment can function as an uninterruptable power supply as well.
* Rated output of 3kW (wind speed of 8m/second)
* The goal is to generate 10MW/h yearly (when 1.2kW/h is generated with an average wind speed of 6m/second).


Betz’s Law: The amount of power that can be generated from the wind is proportional to
the square of the rotor diameter and to the third power of the wind speed. 





* Wind speed
can be accelerated by reducing the cross-sectional area of the wind turbine so
that it is smaller than the wind inlet port, and as a result, power can be
generated even with a weak wind.
* Structural
strength is increased by adopting a ring format for the wind turbine, and the
entire unit is made more lightweight including the drive area.
* Springs are
attached to the blades of the wind turbine to improve wind gust countermeasures
and wind power recovery efficiency. 
* Exhaust
promoting blades are installed on the exhaust port side to improve exhaust
efficiency.
* Rectifying
blades are attached in the wind collecting port to draw in the wind.
* The
rectifying blades serve as a guard to keep out wildlife.
* The newest life extending device is attached to the battery so that battery does not need to be replaced.





Comparison with Other Types



Technical Elements



* Betz’s Law and the Law of Continuity are applied.


* When the cross sectional area is reduced to 1/5, the fluid speed is increased 5 times, and the amount of power that is generated is increased 25 times. Wind is accelerated 5 times by adopting a cross sectional area of 0.15-square-meter for the ring wind turbine relative to the 0.78-square-meter cross sectional area of the outer circumferential dome. 


* The energy when wind blows at a speed of 10m/second over an area of 1 square meter is approximately 1kW/h. According to the Betz limit, a maximum of 600W of energy can be converted, but when the mechanical efficiency is 50%, the energy becomes 300W.

* With
the prototype this time, an output of 47W is expected with a wind speed of
2m/second. With a wind speed of 4m/second, the expected output increases to
376W, at 6m/second, it increases to 1,269W, at 8m/second, it increases to
3,008W, and at a wind speed of 10m/second, the expected output is 5,875W. 






* Lift:
Lift is generated by counteraction for which the wind direction changes due to the blades. The change in direction of the wind between the top and bottom of the blades results in a powerful counteraction. When the upper wind diverges due to the angle, lift is lost. The ideal shape is called a Zhukovsky blade, and dimples like those on golf balls are believed to be effective at preventing divergence. 








* Wind
Resistance: 
The pressure decreases
at the location where wind accelerates, and increases at the location where
wind decelerates.






* Trailing Vortex



* Ring
Rectifying Blades
Lift is obtained from counteraction that changes the wind direction. In other words, the direction of the wind changes behind the blades. According to the Law of Continuity, if the amount of exhaust does not change in the same cross-sectional area but the direction changes, the wind speed increases in a triangular area direction. The wind speed is increased by further changing this direction using the rectifying blades, and a trailing vortex is thereby created. 






Ring Wind Power Generator Performance


Calculation
Method:


Let
the energy when the wind blows at 10m/second over an area of 1 square meter be
1kW/h, the Betz limit be 60%, and the machine efficiency be 50%. (Ordinarily,
machine efficiency is 60~80%.) A 2m/second wind will accelerate 5 times inside
the dome, and the blade speed will become 10m/second.


* Blade cross-sectional area x 1,000W x 0.6 x 0.5 = power generation capacity with wind speed of 2m/second
According to Betz’s Law, the amount of power generated is proportional to the third power of the wind speed.
* The third power of the quotient of wind speed divided by two x 2m power generation capacity = power generation capacity


* Preliminary performance calculation of 5 times the cross-sectional area ratio with a diameter of 1m (blade cross-sectional area of 0.157 square meter)

LEAOS was developed with a great deal of loving attention to detail. All of the elements have been designed expressly, and harmoniously incorporated into the whole. High-quality materials, such as the leather and the aluminum parts that have been integrated into the body in a visually appealing way, have been artfully combined with the carbon. The carbon handlebar melds seamlessly into the aesthetics of the body. The lights, display and cables are fully integrated into the handlebars and complete the clear and timeless lines.

State of the Art
The bike parts are not only first rate from a visual point of view, but also from a technical standpoint. The shifting is noiseless and automatic, and the sensitive clutch makes for gentle acceleration. You’ll always get as much engine power as you need. The top-notch aluminum parts on the suspension and brake mounting speak to the bike’s technical and aesthetic refinement. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509578/files/20140415033716-indiegogo__detais2.jpg?1397558236"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>The Cockpit<br/><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/527669/files/20140423051255-_DSC6349.jpg?1398255175"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>The Battery<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/527671/files/20140423051409-_DSC6538.jpg?1398255249"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/608642/files/20140528003458-Foto.JPG?1401262498"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/527679/files/20140423051821-accessoires.jpg?1398255501"" src="""" style=""""/></p>All accessoires are designed specially for LEAOS.

LEAOS is different, it is high tech and design totally unified.We want to change urban mobility which is only possible with innovations and thinking outside standards and breaking rules.Unisex, light, stylish and made for everyday use. that 's what LEAOS is.We developed the bike over the last years, brought it to production and success. To bring the solar bike with the high tech panel to serial production and distribution we need you!Help and shareIf you like the project and can not support us please copy the link above and send it to your friends. What you get? Please see bottom of the page. LEAOS has the advantage to have a body instead of tubes. That allowes us not to use only much more designs on the bike but also to integrate technical elements such as the solar panel.Because of the design of the bike we are able to use a surface to generate enough power. Behind all that there is a innovative way of production, implementing of the panel and hardware electronics to make it work.             Why it is so greatYou do not have to do any effort to recharge the bike. It is just there. It is cool from the design and highly efficient. LEAOS is the first E-Bike with a consequent unbroken designline including handlebar and fork. Furthermore the challange was to pack all the technical elements into the body, which is totally new in the bicycle industry. We work as car designer do, the design is not affected negatively by the technical components.

Zerocarbonfootprint with LEAOS gets to other target groups and out of the ugly style.
Clean carbon fibre monocoque with central motor and NuVinci automatic gear hub. Integrated Light system, Carbon fibre cockpit with integrated digital display.dDesigned and handmade in Italy


Others about LEAOSUntil now solar integration in bikes done in that way:Wings of panels on the bike which never had the potential of becoming a serial production because of the ugly style and not made for everyday use.We change that! With our design solar becomes an integrated part and a design element. Many people never would even think in buying an E-Bike because it is uncool, not hipp and many special bikes are not for everyday use. LEAOS is different. We attract people that love objects with style. And as a collateral effect they also do something good for the enviornment. Leaos is made for everyday use. It is constructed very intelligently:
unisex: low entrance
comfortable: automatic gear hub. Nice accessoires: design rack for bags, fully integrated mud guards, bag holder. 
Very safe driving: we tested a lot to find a geometry and components which allowes to drive very safely.

LEAOS was developed with a great deal of loving attention to detail. All of the elements have been designed expressly, and harmoniously incorporated into the whole. High-quality materials, such as the leather and the aluminum parts that have been integrated into the body in a visually appealing way, have been artfully combined with the carbon. The carbon handlebar melds seamlessly into the aesthetics of the body. The lights, display and cables are fully integrated into the handlebars and complete the clear and timeless lines.



State of the Art
The bike parts are not only first rate from a visual point of view, but also from a technical standpoint. The shifting is noiseless and automatic, and the sensitive clutch makes for gentle acceleration. You’ll always get as much engine power as you need. The top-notch aluminum parts on the suspension and brake mounting speak to the bike’s technical and aesthetic refinement. The CockpitThe BatteryAll accessoires are designed specially for LEAOS. We are working all the time on new accessoires to make it even more complete in design and function. Mud Guards                                                       Carbon rackThe solar panel integrationWe work with the panel integration on both sides to get to a reasonable surface. Inside it will have a highly developed electronics board to get out the most and make it work with the whole bikes electronics. The user will not have to turn on or off anything. It is all auto functioning. And you will see the level of solar power coming in. The bike technologyCarbon Monocoque The entire E-Bike is build of carbon fibre, also mud guards and rack. the highlight is the carbon monocoque frame. We are using formula 1 tecnology to make it work. A highly developed body with huge functions and special materials beside the carbon to make it light, flexible and good to ride. Nevertheless there is no aluminum or similiar inside. The body is self-carrying. Make LEAOS your own. LEAOS bikes can be adjusted to your personal 
preferences. Speedy almost to the point of aggressive, without fenders. 
Or with mudguards so that you’re sure to be prepared for all weather 
conditions. A minimalist carbon rack offers room for a briefcase or 
shopping basket. Different handlebar heights and handlebar variants, 
like Sport or Comfort, and material options such as wook look, facilitate making it your own.


We have a fully integrated concept and the first E-Bike with solar panel integration which is a real integration.  Which means that our E- bike is the first and only to integrate seriously all technical components without compromise in design but even better with a totally clean design concept. In case we do not reach the entire goal you can be sure that we invest the money in the most intelligent way to bring the project to success. We are a young company that believes in a necessary revolution on the e - bike market regarding design, technology and function. Based in Bolzano, north of Italy. I personally  am expert in marketing, sales and product development. We have got a very good network of engineers, Italian designers and a competent partner of the  industry for the solar panel integration.info@leaos.com Company websiteWe are now in the second sales year of the LEAOS and build up a relevant sales network. We want to get further and make the revolution on the market even bigger than we already did. We are in the developement process of the solar integration since one year and have got already fully working prototypes.  We will bring it to serial production in 2015. We are developing since 2012 and did already huge investments on our side to to create a very cool unique E-Bike. We already set up a serial production. So we are not using your money just to try something out. But we seriously invest in innovations and out company which is already a serious part of the bicycle industry. To continue beeing innovative, outstanding and to bring to success the solar bike, that is why we need the money. 
The campain to us is very important because we can become a serious player in our specific segment of lifestyle and new urban mobility.With the money we will be able to guarantee a highly developed technical feature, and intelligent positioning in the market.
We are used to spend money very strategically, and are able to take out the most possible of any dollar. 

So for anyone that decides to help us I can promise that we know the market, have a very good product, not just an idea, and do it with passion because we believe in it. The valueThe project will make you part of a beginning revolution on the e- bike market. You will be one of the people which are part from the beginning. People generally are looking always more for products they can identify with. And bicycles are much more than just for transportation or following the green energy idea. They can be emotional objects and lead to a future with a totally different mobility concept and be technologically highly innovative in the same time. You can trust us that we have got a strategic thinking.  We are working on the bike project for three years and the solar project for one year and have done a very clear planning to bring it to success. free shipping in EUPlease add shipping costs to USA, and other490 USD for Bikes10 USD for otherHelp and share- what you get

Progress along the way... Step one was for us to get the right motors and batteries, and from there we could make sure the fun was going to always be dependable
Our next step was to make sure the electronics and the motors could keep up with the user's imagination... good thing our engineers are pretty slick individuals... they even amaze us sometimes!
Then, after all that, we could figure out how to make the device look good and feel even better... We used the most state of the art SLA 3D printers on the market and we're always making changes to build the best toy available!
This is actually a photo of our very first PCB and the USI/Broadcom Wi-Fi chip alongside. We didn't skimp on anything... our PCB designers and Electrical Engineers insisted they wanted our logo on the PCB Circuitry 'cause they were proud to say its all our own custom design! We use a USI Broadcom Wi-Fi chip: the very same as you might find in your apple or android smart device. 
 
We are beyond proud of the complete package, from the matte Black linen covered box with a custom cut foam inside to protect and to keep safe from prying eyes to the subtly embossed logo on the cover that gives a rich appeal... to the soft velvet bag that lets your device sleep in style or the key chain that's going be the talk of your friends! Blackcatbox is not just a product, a device, or just your run of the mill vibrator.... it's technology... it's the next wave in cyber sensuality....Blackcatbox is a way of enjoying life the way it's meant to be enjoyed! 

Our awesome Blackcatbox embossed Matte Black Linen covered box will protect the device in shipping and if you want to make it a safe home for the device it will do that too! 
Of course our Black Linen box will be shipped inside a discrete brown box from Sikwrx, Inc. that will help keep prying eyes away.


We are proud that over the last year we have made HUGE steps in progress and though it may seem we sparred no expense, we have been extremely thrifty since it's the teams money that we have had the honor of using! We will carry on that frugal and thrifty mentality, insuring you as our VALUED customer get a valuable and worthwhile product.
 

We're looking to raise these funds to fast-track production. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to give the Blackcatbox device as a gift for Valentines Day? The funds raised will be used for finalization of the silicone molds, purchase of the plastic molds and begin the manufacturing process. Your support will go directly to cover the cost of manufacturing the actual device you ordered. 
Any additional funds will be allocated to additional products, as well as advancing user friendly mobile app development. We have invested $100,000 of our own funds for design, patent filing, prototyping, software validation and programming.

<p>Tangled cords and lost headsets are constantly growing problems; an iPod without headphones is useless, and an iPhone without a handsfree device is a dangerous distraction when driving, not to mention illegal in 10 U.S.states. Because current solutions are either device specific, bulky and ugly, or are separate from the device, these problems have persisted. <em><strong>Until now.</strong></em></p>
<h1><strong>Introducing the Bakjax</strong></h1>
<p>A Bakjax is a patent pending attachable pocket to hold your bluetooth or headphones and keep it where you need it, with your device! The Bakjax is designed to work on a wide variety of devices such as the iPhone (all models including the iPhone 5), Android or Windows smartphones, larger iPods, etc.  We've tested it with nearly 50 different devices successfully. Because a Bakjax is made from very thin but durable materials, it adds no bulk to your device when it is empty, and <em><strong>it works on devices with or without cases</strong>.</em></p>
<p>If you need to remove the Bakjax from your device, in 2 seconds it becomes a self contained carrying case. Whether you drop it in your purse, your cup holder, or your pocket, it is easily found. Then, simply reattach the Bakjax to your device (in about 5 seconds), and your stuff is right where you need it.</p>
<p>What else could you use a Bakjax for?</p>
<h1><strong>How it works</strong></h1>
<p>Made of two joined solid pieces of durable fabric, the Bakjax uses the opposing tension from the corners of the device to secure itself. Using a pull-tab velcro closure, your Bakjax becomes an enclosed carrying case, keeping your headphones tangle free and any other items secure.</p>
<h1><strong>Production</strong></h1>
<p>We've been developing and refining the design of the Bakjax for almost 4 years, to arrive at what we feel is the perfect solution. Bakjaxes are made in our very own production facility in Vancouver, Washington. Headed up by Roberta (with nearly 20 years of manufacturing experience), a small team of expert seamstresses hand craft each piece with attention to detail and a sharp eye for quality. Bakjaxes are shipped in eco-friendly, minimalist packaging to reduce environmental impact.</p>

<p>Indiegogo is a funding platform for creative projects.  We have personally set up everything on this page including our project funding goal and deadline.  If you think Mobile-Mags is as fantastic as we do and would like to try it sooner than later, then all you have to do is click on one of our great rewards on the right side of the page.  If you would like to help the Mobile-Mags venture, please jump on board and please spread the word!</p>
<p><strong>What is Mobile-Mags?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a driver receiving a phone call and the phone has slipped out of the dash cubbyhole onto the floorboards black hole.   Noticing the fumbling driver a police officer pulls over the driver and issues a ticket.  Essentially, this is a daily occurrence all over the world and with the evolving laws for hand-free devices we introduce to you Mobile-Mags. </p>
<p>Mobile-Mags is a simple accessory that uses magnetic attraction to hold any mobile device on the market. </p>
<p>For details visit <a href=""http://www.mobile-mags.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mobile-mags.com</a> or shoot us an email </p>
<p><strong>The Design</strong></p>
<p>Mobile-Mags has been re-engineered to be wonderfully simple to use and incredibly robust. Using Mobile-Mags exclusive magnetic structure, the magnetics’ now act like a ""Socket and a Plug"" that work perfectly together and looks amazing when in place. Which give this product line is ""Magnetic Attraction"" name as display on our website and packaging <a href=""http://www.mobile-mags.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Mobile-Mags.com</a>.   </p>
<p>A Mobile-Mags unit is the perfect way to hold your mobile device while driving or simply wanting a secure place for storage while in class or working out at the gym.  Depending on the Mobile-Mag you choose, a small magnetic cradle attaches most anywhere (such as dashboard, inside locker, office, home) using a 3M high performance adhesive or simply attach to air vent.   Once the Mobile-Disc has been adhered by the 3M adhesive to the back of your mobile device you are ready for your hands-free experience. </p>
<p>Especially for the larger mobile devices such as Readers or Tablets we designed the Base-Mag or the Base-Mag with a gripper. The special rotating cradle allows you to rotate from portrait to landscape positions with a simple turn of the wrist. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile-Discs</strong> are the round button like discs that are put on the back of your mobile device with a 3M adhesive then will enable you to snap your mobile device onto the Mobile-Mag product as shown here:</p>
<p><img alt=""Mobile-Disc"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/748/870/9ae8ac3b802df5c5332a74624fc0e12e_large.jpg?1373923886"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mobile-Disc""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The First device is called the “<strong>Button-Mag</strong>"". The Button-Mags attaches mobile devices magnetically to a fixed location. Simply attach the Button-Mag in a fixed position inside your home or office, automobile, school or gym locker, boat, a garage wall or any location you would like to have your mobile device. This enables a hands-free to enjoy listening to music or talking on the cell phone. </p>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Button-Mags"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/748/003/ea69db5544a52b2f0a9a6654f3ac0376_large.jpg?1373903996"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Button-Mags""/> </strong></h2>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The Second device is called the<strong> “Gripper-Mag""</strong>. This gripper device has been specially designed to grip onto your automobile’s air vent without damaging the air vent. We have developed this grip device with special rivets so that the gripper remains in place when lifting mobile device from the cradle. In addition, this Mobile-Mag device can be easily removed so that it may be used from one vehicle to another. This device works with all MP3/4 players, and all Cell Phones. This device is very small and discreet unlike other mobile cradles in the marketplace that are very bulky or obstructive.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>The Third product is the <strong>“Base-Mag"" </strong>with a gripper. This device is very similar to product the Gripper-Mag however, we have designed a exclusive rubber cradle that is capable to be used with all mobile devices such as MP3/4 Players, All Cell Phone brands, all Mobile GPS devices, and all sizes of Tablet Computers. In addition this Mobile-Mag device can be used in the landscape or portrait positions with a simple twist of the wrist. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>The fourth product is called the<strong> “Base-Mag”</strong>. This product has been specially designed for all mobile devices. It works with MP3/4 Players, all Cell Phones (even the very largest units), Mobile GPS units and Tablet Computers, such as the IPad or IPad Mini. This unit special application can be used in the landscape or portrait positions therefore you can rotate the mobile device to your preferred viewing position. You can also remove this device from car to car, or attach the product from you car to your home, office area, garage, school/gym locker, Boat or RV just by pulling the device from its magnetic base and reattaching it at the next location by the use of multiple bases we will be providing in the packaging.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Will a magnet damage your mobile device? </p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: No magnets have no effect on solid state electronics such as phones, gps units, or tablets.  Mobile-Mags does use a strong magnet so we suggest using caution around magnetically sensitive items such as credit cards, pacemakers, and hard drives.  Mobile-Mags assumes no liability for damage to such devices. </p>
<p>Tablet and phone cases have been made using magnets without harm to the device <a href=""http://www.macworld.com/article/1164814/the_week_in_ios_accessories_wrap_it_up.html%20%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.macworld.com/article/1164814/the_week_in_ios_accessories_wrap_it_up.html%20%20</a>  </p>
<p>According to PC World “There’s nothing magnetic in flash memory, so [a magnet] won’t do anything”.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/116572/article.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/116572/article.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What if I want to remove the cradle from its location or the button from my mobile device?  Is it permanent?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: No.  While the 3M adhesive is very strong, it can be removed without damage.  Do Not Reuse the 3M adhesive.  We will be happy to mail you a new adhesive. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our names are Terry and Carolyn Golliher.  We are a husband and wife team that lives in Henderson, Nevada. Our three children keep us very busy and we are constantly looking for new ways to get ahead. Especially Terry.  Countless times Terry has found new ideas that will be the “next-best-thing” that inevitably ends up becoming the newest artifact added to the museum of pastime creations of the garage.  He has always been looking for something simple and sellable to help improve the quality of life for his family, friends and others.  So our story begins.    </p>
<p>One day as the Golliher family was driving to their favorite restaurant he had turned the corner and his cell phone flew out of a small cubbyhole onto the floorboard (we call this the vehicles black whole because most of the time when something falls, it is never again found). When this happens all of the passengers were scrambling in trying to figure out where the device ultimately ended up. So, once retrieved, Terry had realized that there was a great need for all mobile users to have a secure holding device for his or her mobile device of choice. </p>
<p>So, Terry went shopping for the different holders on the market and found that many where too intrusive or product brand specific (such as Apple). He also discovered that many products were very expensive, or complicated to install besides usage and not readily available for the common consumer to buy. Moreover, much of the mobile holders are made in a foreign country. </p>
<p>Ultimately, Terry was so frustrated with the whole process he decided to manufacture a magnet holding device that would be user friendly for all age groups, priced affordably, convenient for purchasing, and most of all manufactured in the United States.   </p>
<p>After months of research and hard work we agreed to design several models to accommodate different applications for the common consumer.  Our goal is to manufacture a product that would be user friendly and affordable.  In addition to providing a useful product for the consumer it was extremely important to employ locals and to help bring back manufacturing to the United States.  In a small way we would be able to employ several people along the way.  So, with your kind donations from Indiegogo we will be able to collaborate with the 3M adhesive, a CAD Drawer, a Tooling and manufacturing company, a Art and Video Graphics company, a box company, and assembly plus packing by the local Opportunity Village employees. </p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Learning from previous projects, we know what it takes to make a product like this.  Tooling, production, and fulfillment are all lined up, so now we only need deposits in order to start manufacturing.  That said, things don’t always go as expected, and delays sometimes occur.  It is for this reason; we have built in a buffer period into our delivery expectations.  More importantly, we have created a very clear schedule so if things do arise, you will be the first to know.  We are all in this together.  We want to make sure that everyone is well informed as things progress.</p>

Simply attach the Button-Mag in a fixed position inside your home or office, automobile, school or gym locker, boat, a garage wall or any location you would like to have your mobile device. This enables a hands-free to enjoy listening to music or talking on the cell phone. 
 
 
The Second device is called the “Gripper-Mag"". This gripper device has been specially designed to grip onto your automobile’s air vent without damaging the air vent. We have developed this grip device with special rivets so that the gripper remains in place when lifting mobile device from the cradle. In addition, this Mobile-Mag device can be easily removed so that it may be used from one vehicle to another. This device works with all MP3/4 players, and all Cell Phones. This device is very small and discreet unlike other mobile cradles in the marketplace that are very bulky or obstructive.

 
The Third product is the “Base-Mag"" with a gripper. This device is very similar to product the Gripper-Mag however, we have designed a exclusive rubber cradle that is capable to be used with all mobile devices such as MP3/4 Players, All Cell Phone brands, all Mobile GPS devices, and all sizes of Tablet Computers. In addition this Mobile-Mag device can be used in the landscape or portrait positions with a simple twist of the wrist. 

 
The fourth product is called the “Base-Mag”. This product has been specially designed for all mobile devices. It works with MP3/4 Players, all Cell Phones (even the very largest units), Mobile GPS units and Tablet Computers, such as the IPad or IPad Mini. This unit special application can be used in the landscape or portrait positions therefore you can rotate the mobile device to your preferred viewing position. You can also remove this device from car to car, or attach the product from you car to your home, office area, garage, school/gym locker, Boat or RV just by pulling the device from its magnetic base and reattaching it at the next location by the use of multiple bases we will be providing in the packaging.

FAQ
Q: Will a magnet damage your mobile device? 
A: No magnets have no effect on solid state electronics such as phones, gps units, or tablets.  Mobile-Mags does use a strong magnet so we suggest using caution around magnetically sensitive items such as credit cards, pacemakers, and hard drives.  Mobile-Mags assumes no liability for damage to such devices. 
Tablet and phone cases have been made using magnets without harm to the device http://www.macworld.com/article/1164814/the_week_in_ios_accessories_wrap_it_up.html%20%20  
According to PC World “There’s nothing magnetic in flash memory, so [a magnet] won’t do anything”.
http://www.pcworld.com/article/116572/article.html
Q: What if I want to remove the cradle from its location or the button from my mobile device?  Is it permanent?
A: No.  While the 3M adhesive is very strong, it can be removed without damage.  Do Not Reuse the 3M adhesive.  We will be happy to mail you a new adhesive. 
 
Summary
Our names are Terry and Carolyn Golliher.  We are a husband and wife team that lives in Henderson, Nevada. Our three children keep us very busy and we are constantly looking for new ways to get ahead. Especially Terry.  Countless times Terry has found new ideas that will be the “next-best-thing” that inevitably ends up becoming the newest artifact added to the museum of pastime creations of the garage.  He has always been looking for something simple and sellable to help improve the quality of life for his family, friends and others.  So our story begins.    
One day as the Golliher family was driving to their favorite restaurant he had turned the corner and his cell phone flew out of a small cubbyhole onto the floorboard (we call this the vehicles black whole because most of the time when something falls, it is never again found). When this happens all of the passengers were scrambling in trying to figure out where the device ultimately ended up. So, once retrieved, Terry had realized that there was a great need for all mobile users to have a secure holding device for his or her mobile device of choice. 
So, Terry went shopping for the different holders on the market and found that many where too intrusive or product brand specific (such as Apple). He also discovered that many products were very expensive, or complicated to install besides usage and not readily available for the common consumer to buy. Moreover, much of the mobile holders are made in a foreign country. 
Ultimately, Terry was so frustrated with the whole process he decided to manufacture a magnet holding device that would be user friendly for all age groups, priced affordably, convenient for purchasing, and most of all manufactured in the United States.   
After months of research and hard work we agreed to design several models to accommodate different applications for the common consumer.  Our goal is to manufacture a product that would be user friendly and affordable.  In addition to providing a useful product for the consumer it was extremely important to employ locals and to help bring back manufacturing to the United States.  In a small way we would be able to employ several people along the way.  So, with your kind donations from Indiegogo we will be able to collaborate with the 3M adhesive, a CAD Drawer, a Tooling and manufacturing company, a Art and Video Graphics company, a box company, and assembly plus packing by the local Opportunity Village employees. 
Risks and Challenges
Learning from previous projects, we know what it takes to make a product like this.  Tooling, production, and fulfillment are all lined up, so now we only need deposits in order to start manufacturing.  That said, things don’t always go as expected, and delays sometimes occur.  It is for this reason; we have built in a buffer period into our delivery expectations.  More importantly, we have created a very clear schedule so if things do arise, you will be the first to know.  We are all in this together.  We want to make sure that everyone is well informed as things progress.
A Special Thank you in helping us so far!

<p><b>PhotoFast history:</b></p>
</div>
<div>PhotoFast designed the first i-FlashDrive back in 2009. The founder of PhotoFast, Warren Wang, came up with the concept after feeling frustrated of the limitations on his new iPhone 2G of handling data. Warren's storage and data background influenced the idea to have a flash drive for iPhones, which seemed like the natural solution.</div>
<div>Hardware that communicated with the iOS was the biggest challenge but not impossible. After finalising the prototype and receiving Apple's MFi certification the first generation hit the market in 2011.</div>
<div>Ever since then PhotoFast have continued to make the drives more powerful, smaller and supported by the i-FlashDrive ONE app that allows data handling to be smooth and natural for Apple fans.</div>
<div>MemoriesCable was designed to solve the problems of data backup, added storage and charging all in one for iPhone and iPad users everywhere.</div>
<div>""MemoriesCable is our 13th generation of product and we are proud to offer it on the Indiegogo platform where we believe most of the followers are as crazy about technology as we are"", commented CEO Warren Wang.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438520229/ipfbvyzxjhwmzhdvqkmf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
PhotoFast have chosen to use the Indiegogo platform because there has never been an iOS storage device in the form of a cable. Getting the MemoriesCable into the hands of such an important peer group quickly was the main advantage as well as to have a very dynamic way of receiving fast feedback.
</div>
<div>""We hope the Indiegogo followers love the MemoriesCable as much as we do and we highly anticipate their comments and opinions to our launch"", stated Wang.</div>

Timeline of production and delivery:












PhotoFast history:

PhotoFast designed the first i-FlashDrive back in 2009. The founder of PhotoFast, Warren Wang, came up with the concept after feeling frustrated of the limitations on his new iPhone 2G of handling data. Warren's storage and data background influenced the idea to have a flash drive for iPhones, which seemed like the natural solution.
Hardware that communicated with the iOS was the biggest challenge but not impossible. After finalising the prototype and receiving Apple's MFi certification the first generation hit the market in 2011.
Ever since then PhotoFast have continued to make the drives more powerful, smaller and supported by the i-FlashDrive ONE app that allows data handling to be smooth and natural for Apple fans.
MemoriesCable was designed to solve the problems of data backup, added storage and charging all in one for iPhone and iPad users everywhere.
""MemoriesCable is our 13th generation of product and we are proud to offer it on the Indiegogo platform where we believe most of the followers are as crazy about technology as we are"", commented CEO Warren Wang.


PhotoFast have chosen to use the Indiegogo platform because there has never been an iOS storage device in the form of a cable. Getting the MemoriesCable into the hands of such an important peer group quickly was the main advantage as well as to have a very dynamic way of receiving fast feedback.

""We hope the Indiegogo followers love the MemoriesCable as much as we do and we highly anticipate their comments and opinions to our launch"", stated Wang.

It's called <b>hicon - The social Bangle</b>, and it can simplify your life, keeping you  always updated  only about smartphone notifications and social network events that are really important for You.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The idea:</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the internet of things and wearable technologies market, wearable devices and smart wristbands lack a true “social display” that enable them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate our personality and affiliation to particular social spheres.</li>
<li>Encourage visual recognition and physical interaction between other members of the same social networks:</li>
<li>Updates to keep us connected to our social networks in all situations where we cannot have our Smartphone close to us: at school in business meetings, on the beach, while doing sports, while driving, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h2>The Concept:</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>hicon</b> is a groundbreaking, wearable communicator that helps you effortlessly share and organize all your social media.  Tether this fashion smart wristband wirelessly to any smartphone via its intuitive app and go!   Now all your social accounts like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linked In, Pinterest, Viber, WhatsApp and Google Plus are represented by customized icons displayed right on your wrist.  When an alert goes to your smartphone, <b>hicon</b> gently vibrates and lights up in real-time, displaying your specified social network.  <b>hicon</b> also makes meeting new people a breeze.  When users with matching preset interests come in contact, the band will blink to help you make a connection.  <b>hicon</b> brilliantly brings on-line social networking to the physical space.  When it's time to transfer information between devices, do it with a simple hand shake ... it's that easy!  <b>hicon</b> even locates your misplaced phone.  It's <b>100% waterproof</b>, sand and shock proof, so you can wear it ANYWHERE.</p>

<h2>Meet hicon:</h2> <b>hicon</b> wristband is a hi-tech, silicone material shatterproof,  shockproof and waterproof, avaible in many colors and textures, with interchangeable  social network and smartphone notification icons, it is connected via Bluetooth 4.0 L.E. to your  smartphone through its application. Whenever you receive a notification from social  networks or by smartphone applications (mail messages, phone calls, battery life), the corresponding icon lights up and vibrates with discretion. Thanks to the feature “social matching”, you can exchange contacts and references of the social network through the bracelets with  predefined gesture, so we can easily find ourselves in the “virtual” world, share common  interests and passions on the various social network sites, used to generate community  that multiply the spread of the bracelet.<p> </p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Risk of challenge:</span></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The first challenge we will face is mass production. As a company, our goal is to bring our customers the utmost satisfaction with everything we make. The combined experience of our team members offers an extensive background in product development and mass production. Yet, in reality, there is always uncertainty in large-scale production and scheduling of shipments. In order to mitigate these risks, we are partnering with some of the most experienced manufacturers and suppliers in the industry who are specialized in high-end consumer electronics. Timing is the other challenge we will be facing. Before we can sell our product to the market, we need to obtain certifications such as FCC and CE to meet industry legal requirements. Usually, certification takes about four weeks and we would apply for it two months before our first shipment. We have high hopes that we will pass all certifications . However, if the product fails due to a reason that is not accounted for, we will be looking at a one- to three-months delay. Despite the risks and challenges ahead of us, we promise to continuously update you all on our progress and any other important news.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p>We've worked pretty hard to get this far...love to hear your thoughts :)</p>

Already featured in:
 

hicon smart wristband is all your social networks, made wearable.
Hi - We are Tomaso, Gilles, Johnny, Marco and Vittorio from Milan (Italy) and Lugano (Swiss) and we want to tell you about a product we really believe in. It's called hicon - The social Bangle, and it can simplify your life, keeping you  always updated  only about smartphone notifications and social network events that are really important for You.
 

 
 
The idea:
 
In the internet of things and wearable technologies market, wearable devices and smart wristbands lack a true “social display” that enable them to:

Communicate our personality and affiliation to particular social spheres.
Encourage visual recognition and physical interaction between other members of the same social networks:
Updates to keep us connected to our social networks in all situations where we cannot have our Smartphone close to us: at school in business meetings, on the beach, while doing sports, while driving, etc.

 
 
 

 
 
 

The Concept:
hicon is a groundbreaking, wearable communicator that helps you effortlessly share and organize all your social media.  Tether this fashion smart wristband wirelessly to any smartphone via its intuitive app and go!   Now all your social accounts like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linked In, Pinterest, Viber, WhatsApp and Google Plus are represented by customized icons displayed right on your wrist.  When an alert goes to your smartphone, hicon gently vibrates and lights up in real-time, displaying your specified social network.  hicon also makes meeting new people a breeze.  When users with matching preset interests come in contact, the band will blink to help you make a connection.  hicon brilliantly brings on-line social networking to the physical space.  When it's time to transfer information between devices, do it with a simple hand shake ... it's that easy!  hicon even locates your misplaced phone.  It's 100% waterproof, sand and shock proof, so you can wear it ANYWHERE.
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Meet hicon: hicon wristband is a hi-tech, silicone material shatterproof,  shockproof and waterproof, avaible in many colors and textures, with interchangeable  social network and smartphone notification icons, it is connected via Bluetooth 4.0 L.E. to your  smartphone through its application. Whenever you receive a notification from social  networks or by smartphone applications (mail messages, phone calls, battery life), the corresponding icon lights up and vibrates with discretion. Thanks to the feature “social matching”, you can exchange contacts and references of the social network through the bracelets with  predefined gesture, so we can easily find ourselves in the “virtual” world, share common  interests and passions on the various social network sites, used to generate community  that multiply the spread of the bracelet. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How it works:Plug the icons  you prefer! The icons will illuminate and the bracelet vibrates every time your smartphone receives a notification. Might be an incoming call, calendar alert, text message, email  or events of your social networks. You can dismiss every notification with a  simple shake of your wrist.   
 
 
Always connected through Bluetooth 4.0 !       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 You can add contacts to your phone and  exchange social media profiles  with just a high-five with  or a simple handshake. By tagging digital functions to this friendly gesture that comes naturally to us, hicon gives more meaning to your social interactions. Share your contacts and let your network grow!

Thanks to the feature “radar"" you can find through a geo-referenced map the profiles of other bangle bracelet users around you. You can exchange and  share contacts, references, common interests and passions and generate new communities.
 
 
 

 
 
 
The hicon bangle acts like a tether to your phone, letting you know if you’ve left it behind. hicon wristband will notify you immediately lighting all the icons simultaneously when you go out of range. The 30/50ft separation alert will make sure your smartphone is always safe and secure.

Let's do it together!

Risk of challenge:
The first challenge we will face is mass production. As a company, our goal is to bring our customers the utmost satisfaction with everything we make. The combined experience of our team members offers an extensive background in product development and mass production. Yet, in reality, there is always uncertainty in large-scale production and scheduling of shipments. In order to mitigate these risks, we are partnering with some of the most experienced manufacturers and suppliers in the industry who are specialized in high-end consumer electronics. Timing is the other challenge we will be facing. Before we can sell our product to the market, we need to obtain certifications such as FCC and CE to meet industry legal requirements. Usually, certification takes about four weeks and we would apply for it two months before our first shipment. We have high hopes that we will pass all certifications . However, if the product fails due to a reason that is not accounted for, we will be looking at a one- to three-months delay. Despite the risks and challenges ahead of us, we promise to continuously update you all on our progress and any other important news.
 
We've worked pretty hard to get this far...love to hear your thoughts :)

</p><h3>Who's
behind the Kromecaster?</h3>
<p>The Kromecaster is my brainchild.
I'm Kevin Sweeney, a passionate audiophile with over twenty years
experience in the high end consumer electronics industry. I founded
my first company, KAS Audio while studying physics at Pitt. Our
coffin sized subwoofer produced well defined bass down to 14 Hz.
After a brief stint in high end audio retailing, I got involved in the
recording industry, designing studio monitors used to mix Spyro Gyra,
El DeBarge and many others. I became National Warranty Manager for
Mitsubishi Electronics in the 90's and later worked for Nakamichi
America. My dream has always been to bring the unmistakable dynamic
sound of a live performance into the home. The new high resolution
audio formats and my new Kromecaster make that  dream a reality.</p>
<h3>What
does the Kromecaster do?</h3>
<p>Plug Google's powerful little
Chromecast device into your Kromecaster, connect it  to your
home stereo and in minutes you
will be enjoying master tape quality 192k/24 bit recordings, all
controlled by your smart phone or tablet. You will need internet
access, wifi and a computer to make it work, but once the simple
setup has been completed, operation is as easy as turning on your
stereo and selecting music from your phone or tablet. You can even
use your phone or tablet to control the volume if you wish.</p>
<h3>What
if I want music in more than one room?</h3>
<p>Just buy a Kromecaster (and a
$35 Google Chromecast) for each room! Multiple Kromecasters are a
great way to build a multiroom distributed audio system. You simply
name each Chromecast for the room or area it's in, and select that
area from your phone or tablet. It's much easier to operate than
conventional distributed audio systems, and the sound is much better. You
can use a Kromecaster Pro in your main system and Basics for the rest
of the house. If you can get Netflix working on your TV, you can set up your own super high quality distributed audio system yourself. Need help? Free technical support is just a phone call away. We'll get you up and running in minutes!<br/></p>
<h3>What
makes the Kromecaster better than other streaming options?</h3>
<p>It's easier to use and it sounds
better. Along with sound quality, ease of setup and use were primary
concerns during the development process. Listening to music should
not be a chore, and you shouldn't have to pay a custom installer to
get everything working. Setup and listening are downright easy with
the Kromecaster. In addition to being able to stream your high
resolution files from the cloud or your computer's hard disk, the
Kromecaster works with any Chromecast supported audio app, such as
Pandora or Google's Play Music subscription service. Google
made sure the Chromecast was reliable and easy to use, and we made
sure the end result was uncompromised studio quality sound. The vast
majority of streamers are optical based and suffer from a huge
drawback; they downrez everything to a maximum sample rate of 48k,
while the Kromecaster's HDMI based DACs can decode true high
resolution 192/24 and 96/24 streams. </p>
<h3>What
will my investment be used for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To
	build your Kromecaster(s) should you decide to pre-order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We
	plan on debuting the product to the general public at this fall's
	Rocky Mountain Audio Fest (RMAF). We'll need some money to make a
	big splash in Denver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To
	fund a national marketing campaign. We need to get the word out!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software
	development for our own app and server 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legal, licensing, development
	and infrastructure costs to create subscription based high
	resolution (up to 192/24) cloud streaming service</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>What
are the long term goals for Kromecaster?</h3>
<p>Right now we're using another
company's server and device software which only works with Android
devices. We need money to acquire that software and make it our own,
and to make it compatible with iOS devices. Our ultimate goal is to
develop a subscription based, high resolution streaming service of
our own. There isn't one out there yet, and we've got the talent and
drive to make it happen. We'd love to have you help make this dream come true. Life is too short to listen to bad sound.</p>
<h3>What
if I think this is a great idea but I don't want to fork out $279 or
$1,049?</h3>

</p><br/></div>","Who's
behind the Kromecaster?
The Kromecaster is my brainchild.
I'm Kevin Sweeney, a passionate audiophile with over twenty years
experience in the high end consumer electronics industry. I founded
my first company, KAS Audio while studying physics at Pitt. Our
coffin sized subwoofer produced well defined bass down to 14 Hz.
After a brief stint in high end audio retailing, I got involved in the
recording industry, designing studio monitors used to mix Spyro Gyra,
El DeBarge and many others. I became National Warranty Manager for
Mitsubishi Electronics in the 90's and later worked for Nakamichi
America. My dream has always been to bring the unmistakable dynamic
sound of a live performance into the home. The new high resolution
audio formats and my new Kromecaster make that  dream a reality.
What
does the Kromecaster do?
Plug Google's powerful little
Chromecast device into your Kromecaster, connect it  to your
home stereo and in minutes you
will be enjoying master tape quality 192k/24 bit recordings, all
controlled by your smart phone or tablet. You will need internet
access, wifi and a computer to make it work, but once the simple
setup has been completed, operation is as easy as turning on your
stereo and selecting music from your phone or tablet. You can even
use your phone or tablet to control the volume if you wish.
What
if I want music in more than one room?
Just buy a Kromecaster (and a
$35 Google Chromecast) for each room! Multiple Kromecasters are a
great way to build a multiroom distributed audio system. You simply
name each Chromecast for the room or area it's in, and select that
area from your phone or tablet. It's much easier to operate than
conventional distributed audio systems, and the sound is much better. You
can use a Kromecaster Pro in your main system and Basics for the rest
of the house. If you can get Netflix working on your TV, you can set up your own super high quality distributed audio system yourself. Need help? Free technical support is just a phone call away. We'll get you up and running in minutes!
What
makes the Kromecaster better than other streaming options?
It's easier to use and it sounds
better. Along with sound quality, ease of setup and use were primary
concerns during the development process. Listening to music should
not be a chore, and you shouldn't have to pay a custom installer to
get everything working. Setup and listening are downright easy with
the Kromecaster. In addition to being able to stream your high
resolution files from the cloud or your computer's hard disk, the
Kromecaster works with any Chromecast supported audio app, such as
Pandora or Google's Play Music subscription service. Google
made sure the Chromecast was reliable and easy to use, and we made
sure the end result was uncompromised studio quality sound. The vast
majority of streamers are optical based and suffer from a huge
drawback; they downrez everything to a maximum sample rate of 48k,
while the Kromecaster's HDMI based DACs can decode true high
resolution 192/24 and 96/24 streams. 
What
will my investment be used for?


To
	build your Kromecaster(s) should you decide to pre-order


We
	plan on debuting the product to the general public at this fall's
	Rocky Mountain Audio Fest (RMAF). We'll need some money to make a
	big splash in Denver.


To
	fund a national marketing campaign. We need to get the word out!


Software
	development for our own app and server 
	


Legal, licensing, development
	and infrastructure costs to create subscription based high
	resolution (up to 192/24) cloud streaming service

What
are the long term goals for Kromecaster?
Right now we're using another
company's server and device software which only works with Android
devices. We need money to acquire that software and make it our own,
and to make it compatible with iOS devices. Our ultimate goal is to
develop a subscription based, high resolution streaming service of
our own. There isn't one out there yet, and we've got the talent and
drive to make it happen. We'd love to have you help make this dream come true. Life is too short to listen to bad sound.
What
if I think this is a great idea but I don't want to fork out $279 or
$1,049?


$10
	will get you one year of unlimited high resolution streaming should
	we get that service launched 
	


$100
	will get you a lifetime of high resolution streaming if we can make it happen


Spread the word! It doesn't

<p><em>Sphero - Peacekeeper Edition</em> is a super-sized version of Sphero that you control from your smartphone or tablet. Measuring in at a whopping 3 feet in diameter, weighing over 150 pounds, and reaching speeds still unknown, <em>Peacekeeper</em> ain’t your average robotic ball.</p>
<p><em>Sphero - Peacekeeper Edition</em> has all of the same features we know and love from the original Sphero, except they’re bigger. And we all know bigger is better. This limited edition robot is encased in a custom painted, high-impact polycarbonate shell for ultimate durability. You can drive the ball, play multiplayer games, entertain your pets, and more.</p>
<p>We're raising funds to offset the initial cost of parts and production. If we reach our goal, we plan to start selling <em>Sphero – Peacekeeper Edition </em>through our online store (<a href=""http://store.gosphero.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">store.gosphero.com</a>) in Fall 2013.</p>
<p>For a manageable $10,000 pledge, <em>Sphero - Peacekeeper Edition</em> can even be yours as soon as August, 2013. It’s the perfect gift for the whole family or the serious tech enthusiast. </p>

<h2><strong>Why Peacekeeper?</strong></h2>
<p>Because bigger is better…and because we could.</p>
<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>Mechanically, <em>Sphero - Peacekeeper Edition</em> is essentially a scaled up Sphero. It has two motors that are controlled by a Sphero board and communicate to the smart device via Bluetooth. Each <em>Peacekeeper</em> will have a separate ""dead man remote switch,"" which another operator can use to shut down the <em>Peacekeeper</em> if it loses it's connection to the smart device or becomes unsafe. <em>Sphero - Peacekeeper Edition</em> is designed to stop if it loses control, but this is an added safety measure. Additionally, <em>Peacekeeper</em> requires the user to separate the two halves to charge the marine grade batteries – the batteries will last for over two hours of driving.</p>
<p>Since <em>Peacekeeper</em> is a Sphero, it is fully programmable via one of our numerous APIs and control languages including Objective C and Java – making the <em>Peacekeeper</em> an ideal robotic device for the classroom environment. While all the apps for Sphero will work with the <em>Peacekeeper Edition</em>, some are simply not practical. For an additional charge we can replace the Bluetooth phone control and use a longer-range hobby R/C link. It will be slightly more difficult to drive with this setup but will increase the range threefold.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gosphero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/PK1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Assembly:</strong></h2>
<p>Each <em>Peacekeeper</em> will be hand assembled in Boulder, CO and we can customize the graphics to your liking (depending on the complexity, there may be an additional fee). Driving the <em>Peacekeeper</em> takes a bit of practice. We will provide instructional videos or you may come to Boulder to pick up your <em>Peacekeeper</em> and receive training from our engineering team.</p>
<h2><strong>Safety:</strong></h2>
<p><em>Sphero - Peacekeeper Edition</em> is heavy and large. Caution should be exercised when operating <em>Peacekeeper.</em> It is not intended for use by children or people under the influence of substances that affect motor skills. Due to its ability to crush, we highly discourage users from operating <em>Peacekeeper</em> near small children and pets. This is not a toy. <em> Peacekeeper</em> is a sophisticated, computer-controlled robot and should only be purchased by skilled robotic enthusiasts or technicians. While the video may depict moments of exhilaration and enjoyment, all scenes of crushing and destruction are real, the <em>Peacekeeper</em> can generate a lot of momentum that may be hard to stop. <em>Sphero - Peacekeeper Edition</em> is rugged, but not waterproof. Since the shell must be opened to charge the batteries and access the on and off switches, users must insure the inside mechanism is free from debris prior to use. Interested buyers can contact us for images of the interior mechanism if there are questions before purchase.</p>

<h2><b>RasPiComm+ for education</b></h2>
<p>IT-education in general and mechatronics in particular are becoming ever more important. We want to make the first steps as easy as possible while offering a wide range of project possibilities for very advanced users as well.
For mechatronic schools, mechanical robustness is an important topic. If you have a limited time available each day to teach kids, you simply can't afford to spend even 10 minutes to find the loose cable connection disrupting connection. That is why the RasPiComm+ does not require any wiring between the modules and the mainboard, just slide the modules into the edge connectors and tighten the screws. All set!<br/></p>
<p><b>From the first steps to programming microcontrollers</b><br/>
Out of the box, the RasPiComm+ takes care of a lot of work for you. The setup automatically detects the connected modules and installs firmware and linux drivers. You can then directly access your modules as linux devices. Easy!<br/>
Advanced students can program the microcontroller themselves - it's all open source!<br/>Advanced makers can <b>design custom modules</b> and dive into programming the CPLD, essentially telling the RasPiComm+ how to handle the wiring of the modules and even set up real-time appliances!<br/></p>

<h2>In development:</h2>
<p>We are currently working on a relay module, 433MHz, KNX, 6LowPAN and other exciting stuff! Got a module you'd like to see? Send us a message, input is always welcome!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div align=""justify"">
<h2><b>Give me an example! I want to see some details!</b></h2>
<p>After connecting your choice of modules to the RasPiComm+ (see below for available modules) you run the setup script ./rpc-setup.sh. Your RasPiComm+ and Raspberry Pi will be configured automatically.</p>
<p>All modules that use <b>serial ports</b> (like RS-232, RS-485, GSM, GPS, Profibus, 1-Wire) are accessible through the standard linux serial ports in the respective folder. A serial module in the RasPiComm+ module slot 1 would be available in the folder<br/>
<i>     /dev/tty/RPC+1</i></p>
<p><b>Digital I/Os</b> are mapped just like the GPIOs of the Raspberry Pi, in the folder<br/>
<i>     /sys/class/gpio</i></p>
<p>A quick example: To display an image on the LCD display module when it is connected to module slot 1, you can simply copy a bitmap file into<br/>
<i>     /proc/rpc+module1/bitmap</i><br/>
and it is displayed on your LCD! It's that easy!</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div align=""justify"">
<h2><b>Can I see the firmware / driver code?</b></h2>
<p>Sure! The firmware and linux drivers are <b>open source</b>!<br/>
First of all: There is no ""one firmware / driver"" package for the RasPiComm+. It's more like a couple thousand. To be able to handle up to 4 of a lot of different modules the CPLD and microprocessor need to be programmed according to the exact combination of modules. And that is an awful lot of possibilities!
<br/>
The setup-script handles all that, so no need to worry about it. For those wanting to tinker with the firmware and drivers themselves we have set up a server to allow you to manually build and download the required code for your specific RasPiComm+ setup. Check out <a href=""http://build.amescon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">build.amescon.com</a>.</p>
<p>Note: To access the 3D Model of your RasPiComm+ configuration you will have to install the Unity web viewer Plug-in.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<div align=""justify"">
<h2><b>More details! I am an engineer, give me more!</b></h2>
<p>So are we! That's why we have thought hard about how to combine out-of-the-box convenience with complete flexibilty. Let's take a look at how it works under the hood:</p>
<p>The <i>./rpc-setup.sh</i> script requests two firmware packages for our server. One firmware is for the onboard STM32 Cortex-M4 ARM processor, the other one for the Altera MAX V CPLD. Our server calculates the needed I/Os on the ARM for the corresponding modules and the wiring in the CPLD. The CPLD takes care of the dynamic wiring between the modules and the microcontroller. In the next step our server compiles both firmware packages and sends a compressed tar.gz as a reply to the request. The script then unpacks the firmware and programs the microcontroller via the serial port on the Raspberry Pi. The CPLD is also programmed by the script (we use the I/O lines of the Raspberry Pi to bit-bang the JTAG commands for that).</p>
<p>When CPLD and microcontroller are set up the script configures and loads the required drivers for the modules.</p>
<p>If you want, you can modify every single bit and build it yourself: You can download the sourcecode for your configuration. In this case we do not compile it on the server but return the source to you. You can then compile the microcontroller code with a GCC based cross-compiler. You'll find instructions on our website on how to do that. You also get the generated Verilog code for the CPLD. To compile this code you need to download the free version of Quartus from Altera, available for Windows and  Linux. You can then add functionality to the microcontroller and CPLD code if you want. Compile it and program the binaries you created using our setup script.</p>

<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<br/>
<p><b>Flexible funding? What happens if you don’t reach your goal?</b>
<br/>You will get your perk anyway! One of the reasons why we chose flexible funding was that paying with credit-card is not possible with fixed funding (fixed funding only supports PayPal).</p>
<p><b>I want to order several modules - how much is shipping then?</b>
<br/>All your perks are shipped in one package, so shipping costs only apply once, $25 for European and $35 for International Shipping.</p>
<p><b>If multiple serial modules are used, what is the maximum total throughput
you’ve managed?</b>
<br/>You can have up to 4 serial ports on the RasPiComm+. We tested the system with all the four modules running at 115.200 baud simultanously. Higher transfer rates may be possible but have not been tested as of yet.</p>
<p><b>Is there an RTC module planned?</b>
<br/>The RasPiComm+ mainboard already has a real-time-clock with backup battery onboard! We even included a RTC driver. You can run the <i>hwclock</i> command after our drivers are loaded.</p>
<p><b>Will Python example code be made available?</b>
<br/>We will provide a lot of sample code in the next weeks for all major languages. You don't need a special API, you can use existing examples that use serial communication (/dev/tty...) for the serial modules.</p>

""I've been following the development process of the RasPiComm+ during the last months and am really excited to join the team now to get this product into the real world. What I like most about the product is that it will absolutely help people to realize what they have in mind.""


Our vision
For us, this Indiegogo-campaign is not just a way to raise money. We appreciate your feedback and input and will read all your messages carefully. So please share your experience and questions with us! Together we can build a whole new world of automation! Thank you for your support.





Why we need your help
We have worked on the RasPiComm+ for more than 2 years and have made dozens of prototypes. The RasPiComm+ is ready for series production with our contract manufacturer. To decrease the production costs to affordable levels we need to produce at least 1.000 units of the RasPiComm+ and each module. Since this is very expensive, we need your help! The money you pledge will go directly into sourcing, production and shipment.



Timeline




Risks & Challenges
We are confident in our technology and have worked hard to organize our supply chain. We have already produced hardware and PCB boards on a large scale with our first Raspberry Pi extension board, the RasPiComm which was launched in 2012.



We appreciate your help in spreading the word!
We know that you are the ones that help us make this project come to life.
As a big “THANK YOU” we are rewarding our top referrers. 1st 
place is our 'Unique and first' Top Perk! Get the complete RasPiComm+ 
Package including the RasPiComm+ and the first 8 modules (GPS, GSM, 8 
Input, 8 Output, 8 Analog, RS-485, RS-232, Profibus) in a specially 
designed box signed by all team members. You will also receive your RasPiComm+ a lot earlier than everybody else:
 4 weeks after the campaign ends.

Frequently asked questions

Flexible funding? What happens if you don’t reach your goal?
You will get your perk anyway! One of the reasons why we chose flexible funding was that paying with credit-card is not possible with fixed funding (fixed funding only supports PayPal).
I want to order several modules - how much is shipping then?
All your perks are shipped in one package, so shipping costs only apply once, $25 for European and $35 for International Shipping.
If multiple serial modules are used, what is the maximum total throughput
you’ve managed?
You can have up to 4 serial ports on the RasPiComm+. We tested the system with all the four modules running at 115.200 baud simultanously. Higher transfer rates may be possible but have not been tested as of yet.
Is there an RTC module planned?
The RasPiComm+ mainboard already has a real-time-clock with backup battery onboard! We even included a RTC driver. You can run the hwclock command after our drivers are loaded.
Will Python example code be made available?
We will provide a lot of sample code in the next weeks for all major languages. You don't need a special API, you can use existing examples that use serial communication (/dev/tty...) for the serial modules.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>How Does SunTunes Work?</h3>
<p>When the volume on your SunTunes is set to a low level, the music sounds loud enough to you but not to others near you.

<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">Introducing XC Tracer</b><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>The Indiegogo campaign has ended, and  XC Tracer is now available at <b><a href=""http://www.xctracer.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.xctracer.com</a>, shipping usually within 1-2 business days. </b>There is also more information on the new website, including the newest firmware and instructions how to update the firmware.</p>
<p>XC Tracer is an advanced flight instrument for paragliders, using data from an 9-DOF IMU, from a pressure sensor and from a GPS to compute the real time climb rate and altitude, avoiding the undesired time lag that conventional variometers have due to data filtering. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F120690172&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F120690172&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F508612643_295x166.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><i>Prototype of XC Tracer with 3D printed enclosure, same size as production version</i></p>The GPS provides also real time flight speed and direction. All the relevant information is then packed together in a custom NMEA like data string and sent over a Bluetooth Low Energy module to an iOS or Android tablet or phone. And of course the variometer indicates the climb / sink rate with beeping tones. It is very easy to fly in thermals with XC Tracer, since what you feel and what the variometer indicates do perfectly match. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">There is a thread on </span><a href=""http://www.paraglidingforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=70588"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Paraglidingforum</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> about XC Tracer, including a first beta test review.</span>

</div>
<p>As a paraglider pilot and designer since more than 25 years (<a href=""http://www.gingliders.com/team/test-pilots/koni-schafroth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.gingliders.com/team/test-pilots/koni-schafroth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">right now working for Gin Gliders</a>) I was always stunned that the principle how a hang glider variometer works has not changed since I learnt to fly paragliders. Variometers measure the rate of change of altitude by detecting the change in air pressure (static pressure) as altitude changes, and a filter “smoothes” the signal in order produce a usable beeping tone that indicates the climb and sink rate. But this filtering leads to an undesired time lag. While flying in thermals the variometer may still indicate a good climb rate, but in fact this may no longer be the case, it’s just because of the time lag that the variometer still beeps, indicating a false climb rate. You can feel this when flying, there is sometimes a discrepancy between what you feel and what the variometer indicates.</p>
<p>My idea was then to make just a variometer that also uses the vertical acceleration in order to calculate and indicate the vertical climb rate in real time, with no time lag. A first prototype device was flown in Winter 2014, in the video made below you can see how sensitive the variometer is.</p>

<p>An attitude and heading reference system AHRS consist of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers on all three axes. Using all the information from these sensors it is possible to calculate the orientation of the device in space, and therefore calculate the gravity compensated vertical acceleration. A Kalman filter then estimates the altitude and climb rate, using the vertical acceleration from the AHRS and the pressure from the pressure sensor.</p>
<p>That worked very well, the variometer had no time lag, but then when talking with friends they had the idea to integrate a GPS, then an SD card, then a BLE module for that the fligth information can be sent to a phone or a tablet...</p>

</div></div>","Introducing XC Tracer


The Indiegogo campaign has ended, and  XC Tracer is now available at www.xctracer.com, shipping usually within 1-2 business days. There is also more information on the new website, including the newest firmware and instructions how to update the firmware.
XC Tracer is an advanced flight instrument for paragliders, using data from an 9-DOF IMU, from a pressure sensor and from a GPS to compute the real time climb rate and altitude, avoiding the undesired time lag that conventional variometers have due to data filtering. 


Prototype of XC Tracer with 3D printed enclosure, same size as production versionThe GPS provides also real time flight speed and direction. All the relevant information is then packed together in a custom NMEA like data string and sent over a Bluetooth Low Energy module to an iOS or Android tablet or phone. And of course the variometer indicates the climb / sink rate with beeping tones. It is very easy to fly in thermals with XC Tracer, since what you feel and what the variometer indicates do perfectly match. There is a thread on Paraglidingforum about XC Tracer, including a first beta test review.
Informationen in deutscher Sprache über  XC Tracer sind im Gleitschirmforum zu finden.Des informations en français sur XC Tracer se trouvent dans le forum de parapentiste.info.


Test flight with XC Tracer prototype (white box) over the Swiss Alps
Additional to that the flight path is recorded on a micro SD card as a Google Earth KML file, or later on also an IGC file will be recorded instead of the KML file.


Google KML file, created with XC Tracer, 5Hz update rate
But it get's even better. XC Tracer is Arduino  compatible, and once the campaign has been successfully funded then the code will be made open source. If you want to program a better data fusion algorithm, or if you want to log different data on the SD card, or if you have another idea than to use XC Tracer for flying, then just adapt the software according to your needs, upload the code to your XC Tracer and go ahead. And last but not least is XC Tracer Swiss Made!

XC Tracer in the production version will look as in the picture above, with the dimensions 57.5 x 57.5 x 19.25mm, and a weight of only 65g.

Well then you will know that ultra wide aspherical lenses are industry gold standard. They make a world of difference, with cheaper spherical lenses often the cause of major distortion and aberration. The wider the lens, the more difficult it is to achieve zero distortion.  No Distortion vs Distorted Image   Why the price difference? It’s all to do with the glass finish based on how the lens is manufactured. Most large-scale manufacturers sand and grind theses spherical lenses in to shape, which can cause minute, but vital imperfections. By melting the glass first, the purity and finish of an aspherical lens can be guaranteed.  The Solution: A New Technique for Zero Distortion With a bit of innovative thinking, the ShiftCam team have come up with a new precision technique to produce the smallest ever aspherical lens for your phone. Combining 15 years of optical engineering experience and 9 months of dedicated product development in partnership with industry leading manufacturers from Korea, Japan and China, the Design and Development team has created one-of a-kind tooling capable of sustaining thousands of degrees heat whilst maintaining precision and accuracy. These custom-made discs of glass will enable perfectly concentrated light sources to be piped into your phone, maintaining zero distortion and replicating all that you see with the naked eye.Lens Structure DesignOf course the ShiftCam Team never do anything by halves. So to be absolutely sure that chromatic aberration does not occur, we’ve taken things one step further, rearranging our lens structure into a unique 6 Element 4 Group structure. We even created new tooling to make sure the final step of nano-coating covers the entire surface of the aspherical lens for edge-to-edge flare-free clarity. The easy alignment system with a slide and shift channel makes changing lenses so easy you can do it with your eyes closed.Small, swift and secure the multi-locking system ensures reliable attachment of your lens regardless of weight, size and focal length.Customised for different iPhones, the ShiftCam Mounting System is a smart but simple accessory that ensures you are always prepared.Universal mount can be mounted on any smartphones, with added cold shoe mount to mount any tools a phonetographer needs.ShiftCam’s increasingly comprehensive series of interchangeable lenses allows you to choose from an array of lenses and get the best results.Compatible with All SmartphonesShiftCam Cases are compatible with iPhone 7 and above. If you’re not an iPhone user, the Kickstarter & Indiegogo Special Edition Universal Mount is compatible with any other smartphone.Comparing ShiftCam 12mm with other Ultra Wide Angle  Using professional-grade aluminium and glass materials, the mounting system and lens are designed with durability in mind. Highly portable and fully capable, ShiftCam delivers an intuitive user experience to suit the needs of all PHONETOGRAPHERS.   To thank you for your support, we are offering all members of our Kickstarter & Indiegogo community: We make all our products with the intention that they should last a lifetime, so it made sense that all our backers from this campaign should receive a Lifetime Warranty for their Aspherical 12mm.

<p> </p>
<p>We love Facebook. We think it’s one of the best ways to keep in touch with friends and family that most of us might not see otherwise. Facebook’s timeline is great. It enables you to organize your posts chronologically and make your own timeline…. sort of. </p>
<p>What we don’t understand is why we can’t place posts exactly where we want to on the Timeline.  Shouldn’t someone be able to post pictures of their fifth birthday party, well, when they were five years old? Shouldn’t pictures from a person’s high school graduation, which they would love to share with my old friends, appear on my Timeline when they graduated high school? Simple, right?</p>
<p>Well, it’s not so simple; at least not yet.</p>
<p>The Timeliner is a simple app that helps you organize your Facebook page chronologically by placing your posts exactly where they belong on the timeline. Now pictures, videos, links and posts appear on the exact date in which they occurred essentially turning your Facebook timeline into a virtual scrapbook.</p>
<p>Now, all you have to do is take a post from your smart phone or tablet and with one click place it where you want on your Timeline, and it’ll stay there. Now you can organize and share your memories from the past with the people that matter. And maybe connect with that kid that always picked on you when you were in third grade.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><em>What is The Timeliner?</em></p>
<p>The Timeliner is an app that integrates with Facebook’s Timeline in a new and exciting way.  It allows you to post pretty much anything you want —pictures, images, videos, whatever — exactly where they belong on your Facebook Timeline.</p>
<p> <em>How does The Timeliner work?</em></p>
<p>It’s simple. You create a memory, and then choose the date where it will appear on your Facebook Timeline. Got a picture from your 1999 high school graduation? The Timeliner allows you to put that picture on the exact day where you made your parents so proud. Now you can share your life with family and friends, even the memories that occurred before you discovered Facebook.</p>
<p> <em>How did you come up with idea for The Timeliner?</em></p>
<p>We all use Facebook. We think it’s a great way to connect with family and friends, but think something’s missing. We can’t figure out how to put a post where it really belongs on our Timeline; we have all this empty space below the date we first registered as a Facebook user. What a waste.</p>
<p><em>What platforms are compatible with The Timeliner?</em></p>
<p>The Timeliner will be compatible with iOS and Android phones and tablets.</p>
<p> <em>How do I download The Timeliner?</em></p>
<p>The app will be available in the App Store and Google Play (for Android devices.)</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jimmy Crangle from Glasgow, Scotland. One thing that has really concerned me for years is; <em>why is email still such an incredibly, unreliable form of communication?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why does email have to be so un-reliable and un-stable</strong></em> despite all of our modern technology? Why can we not send a simple email message with complete certainly that the message will be delivered? and that criminals and competitors will not intercept it? Why do we have to put up with spam mail from people we just don't want to hear from?</p>
<p>This is all completely wrong, and it seems that no-one wants to do anything about it…..but i do!</p>
<p><strong>History &amp; Background</strong></p>
<p>I don't know if you'll remember what a Telex machine was but I was actually one of the UK's last ever Telex consultants. I sold, installed and maintained over 200 old, cranky Telex machines. I was also one of the pioneers in 1995 to develop an iTelex software program to allow users to send Telex messages from their PC via the Telex network.</p>
<p>The old Telex system we used from the 1930's to the 1990's was actually far more reliable &amp; secure than our modern-day email service. Those Telex machines were very slow, but they did have some extreme benefits that the present e-mail system is seriously lacking.</p>
<p><em>People who used the old Telex machines were absolutely sure their messages got delivered without being intercepted by anyone. It's time we had this certainty back!</em></p>
<p><br/><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>I have a solution and it's called eTelex. eTelex is a unique application that gives users 100% guaranteed delivery, reliability, privacy &amp; security. It's spam free, phishing proof and it uses high level encryption. It's easy to use and it protects users from thieves, competitors and governments. eTelex is a free application with a premium level for high end users.</p>
<p><strong>So what I've really done is i've taken the fundamental principals of the once trusted, Telex network, such as guaranteed delivery, security &amp; privacy - and i've incorporated them into a secure, user friendly messaging application.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My goal is to raise USD$20,000 and I will also invest $20,000 of my own savings.</li>
<li>Your funding and support will help develop the fully functional eTelex application to level 1.0</li>
<li>It will take 8 weeks to complete the project.</li>
<li>eTelex can put an end to hackers, criminals and even oppressive governments.</li>
<li>eTelex can help protect freedom of speech, privacy and human rights, especially in developing countries.</li>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Jimmy Crangle from Glasgow, Scotland. One thing that has really concerned me for years is; why is email still such an incredibly, unreliable form of communication?
Why does email have to be so un-reliable and un-stable despite all of our modern technology? Why can we not send a simple email message with complete certainly that the message will be delivered? and that criminals and competitors will not intercept it? Why do we have to put up with spam mail from people we just don't want to hear from?
This is all completely wrong, and it seems that no-one wants to do anything about it…..but i do!
History & Background
I don't know if you'll remember what a Telex machine was but I was actually one of the UK's last ever Telex consultants. I sold, installed and maintained over 200 old, cranky Telex machines. I was also one of the pioneers in 1995 to develop an iTelex software program to allow users to send Telex messages from their PC via the Telex network.
The old Telex system we used from the 1930's to the 1990's was actually far more reliable & secure than our modern-day email service. Those Telex machines were very slow, but they did have some extreme benefits that the present e-mail system is seriously lacking.
People who used the old Telex machines were absolutely sure their messages got delivered without being intercepted by anyone. It's time we had this certainty back!
The Solution
I have a solution and it's called eTelex. eTelex is a unique application that gives users 100% guaranteed delivery, reliability, privacy & security. It's spam free, phishing proof and it uses high level encryption. It's easy to use and it protects users from thieves, competitors and governments. eTelex is a free application with a premium level for high end users.
So what I've really done is i've taken the fundamental principals of the once trusted, Telex network, such as guaranteed delivery, security & privacy - and i've incorporated them into a secure, user friendly messaging application.
What We Need & What You Get

My goal is to raise USD$20,000 and I will also invest $20,000 of my own savings.
Your funding and support will help develop the fully functional eTelex application to level 1.0
It will take 8 weeks to complete the project.
eTelex can put an end to hackers, criminals and even oppressive governments.
eTelex can help protect freedom of speech, privacy and human rights, especially in developing countries.
Let's put an end to unsecured email and junk mail once and for all.
Perks for Your Support
I have some great perks for you:

If you pledge $10 you will be the first to use the eTelex app and you also get 2GB of free online storage for life.
Pledge $25 or more and you get 4GB free storage.
Pledge $50 and you get all of the above plus you will be invited to our launch party in the UK.
Pledge $100 and you get (all of the above) plus 200BG free for two years.
Pledge $1,000 or more and you get 1TB storage for life.
Pledge $5,000 + Plus, and you get all of the above plus we'll fly you to our Glasgow office to participate in a 2-day brainstorming workshop with our entire team on what life-changing apps eTelex should develop next. Your flights & hotel are all included.

<p><span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> was born as part of another leading-edge IR(infra red) project we are working on - Think mega Universal Remote Control meets Arduino &amp; saves the Planet (But don’t tell anyone - it's still a secret).  For this we needed to decode every TV remote control we could find and found the existing products available out there to be either limited or too expensive. The truth is we didn’t find one that met our needs at any price. The good news is that we are making good progress on this project and that as we enhanced our own ‘homebrew’ decoder tool we realised how useful and unique it was and decided to devote resources into launching it as <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we are big fans of Arduino (and Raspberry Pi) we implemented a Windows application which connected to an Arduino with the addition of a just ‘one’ component, an IR receiver. Voilá, we now have what we believe to be the most feature rich IR analyzer &amp; decoder available. It's so good we can decode new IR signals in a fraction of the time before <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>. No need for expensive Logic Analyzers or Oscilloscopes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> already decodes 13 of the most popular IR protocols on the market (up from the 10 mentioned in our Video) which we estimate represents circa 80% of the hundreds of millions of TV type remote controls in homes, hotels, offices, Auditoriums around the world. So today more than 500 million remote controls can be decoded by <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> - not bad eh!. We would welcome our backer’s help in increasing this 80% coverage to 90% and beyond!.</p>

<p><strong style=""color: #036;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We will use your contributions to:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p>Fund development of enhancements to <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>,</p>

<p>A copy of the <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> Getting Started guide (20 pages so far).</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p>A copy of the Arduino source code for your use without any restrictions, plus a copy of the source code for any new platforms supported such as Raspberry Pi etc. You can easily port this Arduino code to any MCU platform (Raspberry Pi, Pic, MSP, AVR) as most of the functionality is in the Windows application.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p>A vote for the next features to be included in <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> (each $ = 1 vote)</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p>All updates to the product for at least 24 months and maybe longer.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p>A link to an online guide to help in the selection of IR receivers for specific projects, which is briefly covered in the User Guide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if we raise our minimum target of $1,000 - <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> will be released. When we hit $2,000 we will add support for Raspberry Pi. If we make $3,000-&gt;10,000 we will add features, protocols and more platforms based on the feedback &amp; votes of you - our backers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have decided to set a low minimum target to ensure there is at least some interest &amp; demand for our project. If we don't reach this minimum threshold we will focus our resources on other exciting IR projects we have in the pipeline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before we get to the perks, we would like to highlight that for the cost of your perk, and using your existing Arduino (Raspberry Pi etc) with a simple IR receiver (~US$1) hooked up to your PC, you will get the best IR Analyzer &amp; Decoder available - outperforming the best professional Oscilloscopes and Logic Analyzers we have seen, without having to part with hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Remember a single use of <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> could save you many times the cost of your perk alone.</p>

<p><strong style=""color: #036;"">Your Perks</strong></p>
<p>We have outlined your perks over on the right. We truly want as many backers as possible to engage with <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>. So we have introduced a discounted perk for Educational use, Hacker clubs, MakerSpaces, Students &amp; any type of Electronics club. To avail of these special rates you will need to use an identifiable email address for product registration. <em>(e.g. me@schoolx.xxx or headmaker@hackespaceNYC.xxx or similar)</em> Registration and support is linked to this email address. Similarly, if you have published your IR project online before the start of this campaign, you may also avail of this rate. (Just include a link in your registration email).</p>
<p>As a further gesture we have also included a limited number of special perks for those who cannot afford more, which will be operated without restriction on a trust basis.</p>
<p>For Professionals, Manufacturers &amp; Kit distributors we have also presented a Full source code perk &amp; Mega packs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For our heroes who have inspired us, we have created a $1 perk, which is as close as possible to a gift.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may have guessed it, that we are a software only team and haven't included any kits (Arduino, Raspberry Pi or IR receivers). However, rest assured if you need to source any of the components we will arrange this for you after the campaign either via our web site or partners. (Our web site <a href=""http://www.analysir.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.AnalysIR.com</a> will be launched after the campaign). We hope to work with kit suppliers to bundle <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> as an of-the-shelf kit, including MCU &amp; IR receiver.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong style=""color: #036;"">Delivery of Perks to Backers</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will continue to work on <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> throughout the campaign and plan to make deliveries in 2 stages commencing within one week of the campaign end. The first set will be to earliest 10% of  backers and largest 10% of backers. We will then spend circa 2-3 weeks ironing out any glitches before releasing to all other backers and expect to issue regular updates until the end of 2013. From next year we will adjust to a standard product release cycle. So if you want to experience and help with the early stage roll-out then either back early or contribute an extra $ or two for your perk or do both!. Participation in the stage 1 rollout is optional.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These early adopters will receive special mention in the initial release of <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>.</p>

<p><strong style=""color: #036;"">The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There are hundreds of millions of discarded TV type remote controls in the world. We found a total of 17 in our own home. Our involvement with IR was inspired by the Arduino community and began with an idea to reduce the waste associated with remote controls. We hope that your support for our campaign will help in reducing this waste in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also believe that <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> will prove to be a great tool for electronics labs within the Education sector, a must have accessory for MakerSpaces, Robotics &amp; Electronics clubs and will also save countless hours for professionals configuring &amp; troubleshooting complex TV &amp; media installations.</p>

<p>Q1) What is the current Status of <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>?</p>
<p>We have been using <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> in-house for a couple of months now, but it is still classified as Beta. We plan to make a full release as part of this campaign with your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q2) What IR protocols are currently supported by <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>?</p>
<p>We support most of the common protocols out there and hope to increase this with the help of our backers. We estimate that these protocols cover circa 80% of the remote controls in use today and some older ones. The list of IR protocols supported today includes:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Q3) Why not just use an Oscilloscope or Logic Analyzer?</p>
<p>Ask any of our team, we have a good Oscilloscope to help us out on certain electrical or analogue challenges, but the first choice is always <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> when it comes to IR decoding, analysis and troubleshooting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have priced the perks which compare favourably to the cost of entry level Oscilloscopes ($300+) or Logic Analyzers ($150+). Oh and did we mention that <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> is far superior at a fraction of the cost for our backers. We would be happy to put <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> head-to-head against the most expensive Oscilloscopes or Logic Analyzers on the market, for IR protocol analysis &amp; decoding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q4) What projects can I use <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> with?</p>
<p>The list is literally endless, because IR can be used to control almost any device on the planet. Here is a small sample:</p>

</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p>Camera control, time-lapse, movement detection, flash synchronisation or just remote snapping</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, IR is the cheapest indoor method to control a device located within the same room and is extremely reliable, at a small fraction of the cost of wired, Wi-Fi, LAN, ZigBee or other RF systems. And guess what - you probably have several spare controllers already available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q5) Is <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span> Open-Source?</p>
<p>We will release all of the MCU code (Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc) to backers without restrictions as to use, which is more liberal than OS. We hope this will encourage the release of 3rd party kits &amp; devices for <span style=""color: #036; font-weight: bold;"">Analys</span><span style=""color: #f00; font-weight: bold;"">IR</span>. However, we are not in a position to release the windows based code at this time. We will revisit this again in the future. We do publish the protocol timings &amp; parameters for each supported protocol within the application itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q6) How does registration work?</p>
<p>When the campaign completes we will issue registration keys in 2 phases, as described above. You will receive a registration key, via email, which will be tied to a single PC and the registration email.</p>

A big thanks to everyone for supporting AnalysIR. Check out our latest updates via the TAB above. We have received quite a few emails since the campaign ended, from people looking to support AnalysIR. So we are happy to say that if you missed the opportunity to support AnalysIR during the campaign, we still have a limited number of perks available on the same terms as in this Campaign  until we launch v1.0 on our main website. You can click here to 'Get AnalysIR' now at the same reduced rate via our website.Note: The Kit perks will only be made available to people who have contributed to another perk which includes AnalysIR. Bonus: AnalysIR now includes support for a number of IR Sources including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, USB IR Toy and TI MSP430 Launchpad.




( We have made lots of updates and added more features to AnalysIR...see the Updates Tab above for all the latest News and BONUS FEATURES! )New KIT Perk added for existing backers. For details click on the GALLERY TAB above and scroll to the bottom of the Gallery page & open the 'IR Starter Kit' document in the Files Section. The kit perk contains a selection of quality IR components, which does not include AnalysIR.

 For more updates on this project please visit our Blog
AnalysIR was born as part of another leading-edge IR(infra red) project we are working on - Think mega Universal Remote Control meets Arduino & saves the Planet (But don’t tell anyone - it's still a secret).  For this we needed to decode every TV remote control we could find and found the existing products available out there to be either limited or too expensive. The truth is we didn’t find one that met our needs at any price. The good news is that we are making good progress on this project and that as we enhanced our own ‘homebrew’ decoder tool we realised how useful and unique it was and decided to devote resources into launching it as AnalysIR.
 
As we are big fans of Arduino (and Raspberry Pi) we implemented a Windows application which connected to an Arduino with the addition of a just ‘one’ component, an IR receiver. Voilá, we now have what we believe to be the most feature rich IR analyzer & decoder available. It's so good we can decode new IR signals in a fraction of the time before AnalysIR. No need for expensive Logic Analyzers or Oscilloscopes.
 
AnalysIR already decodes 13 of the most popular IR protocols on the market (up from the 10 mentioned in our Video) which we estimate represents circa 80% of the hundreds of millions of TV type remote controls in homes, hotels, offices, Auditoriums around the world. So today more than 500 million remote controls can be decoded by AnalysIR - not bad eh!. We would welcome our backer’s help in increasing this 80% coverage to 90% and beyond!.
 





The rationale for our efforts with IR technology is to find ways of reusing the millions of discarded TV remotes controls on the planet. AnalysIR is our first baby step and we look forward to even bigger steps with the help of your backing.
 




What is AnalysIR

AnalysIR is made up of 3 components:


AnalysIR Windows PC application.


An Arduino (or other MCU type platform such as Raspberry Pi, Pic, MSP, AVR etc) with an inbuilt serial over USB, connected to the PC.(Not included)


An 3-pin IR receiver (circa $1) which uses one digital input pin and works off 5V or 3.3V power supply and GND. (Not included, See Guide for more details.)



 
To give you an idea of the functionality we have provided a copy of the pre-release version of the Getting Started Guide and Video, in the gallery (click the Gallery tab near the top of this screen for the Guide & the video link is below). The Guide also includes a Fritzing schematic. Please refer to the Video and Guide for a deeper understanding of the features of AnalysIR. Also see the FAQ below for simple setup instructions.

What We Need & What You Get
We will use your contributions to:


Fund development of enhancements to AnalysIR,


Complete the Documentation


Purchase a Raspberry Pi and similar platforms and publishing the associated on-board software.


Complete & launch our website for community interaction.


In return for your much needed support, you will receive:


A copy of the latest version of AnalysIR via internet download & Licence Key


A copy of the AnalysIR Getting Started guide (20 pages so far).


A copy of the Arduino source code for your use without any restrictions, plus a copy of the source code for any new platforms supported such as Raspberry Pi etc. You can easily port this Arduino code to any MCU platform (Raspberry Pi, Pic, MSP, AVR) as most of the functionality is in the Windows application.


A vote for the next features to be included in AnalysIR (each $ = 1 vote)


All updates to the product for at least 24 months and maybe longer.


A link to an online guide to help in the selection of IR receivers for specific projects, which is briefly covered in the User Guide.


So if we raise our minimum target of $1,000 - AnalysIR will be released. When we hit $2,000 we will add support for Raspberry Pi. If we make $3,000->10,000 we will add features, protocols and more platforms based on the feedback & votes of you - our backers.
 
We have decided to set a low minimum target to ensure there is at least some interest & demand for our project. If we don't reach this minimum threshold we will focus our resources on other exciting IR projects we have in the pipeline.
 
Before we get to the perks, we would like to highlight that for the cost of your perk, and using your existing Arduino (Raspberry Pi etc) with a simple IR receiver (~US$1) hooked up to your PC, you will get the best IR Analyzer & Decoder available - outperforming the best professional Oscilloscopes and Logic Analyzers we have seen, without having to part with hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Remember a single use of AnalysIR could save you many times the cost of your perk alone.


Your Perks
We have outlined your perks over on the right. We truly want as many backers as possible to engage with AnalysIR. So we have introduced a discounted perk for Educational use, Hacker clubs, MakerSpaces, Students & any type of Electronics club. To avail of these special rates you will need to use an identifiable email address for product registration. (e.g. me@schoolx.xxx or headmaker@hackespaceNYC.xxx or similar) Registration and support is linked to this email address. Similarly, if you have published your IR project online before the start of this campaign, you may also avail of this rate. (Just include a link in your registration email).
As a further gesture we have also included a limited number of special perks for those who cannot afford more, which will be operated without restriction on a trust basis.
For Professionals, Manufacturers & Kit distributors we have also presented a Full source code perk & Mega packs.
 
For our heroes who have inspired us, we have created a $1 perk, which is as close as possible to a gift.
 
You may have guessed it, that we are a software only team and haven't included any kits (Arduino, Raspberry Pi or IR receivers). However, rest assured if you need to source any of the components we will arrange this for you after the campaign either via our web site or partners. (Our web site www.AnalysIR.com will be launched after the campaign). We hope to work with kit suppliers to bundle AnalysIR as an of-the-shelf kit, including MCU & IR receiver.
 

Delivery of Perks to Backers
 
We will continue to work on AnalysIR throughout the campaign and plan to make deliveries in 2 stages commencing within one week of the campaign end. The first set will be to earliest 10% of  backers and largest 10% of backers. We will then spend circa 2-3 weeks ironing out any glitches before releasing to all other backers and expect to issue regular updates until the end of 2013. From next year we will adjust to a standard product release cycle. So if you want to experience and help with the early stage roll-out then either back early or contribute an extra $ or two for your perk or do both!. Participation in the stage 1 rollout is optional.
 
These early adopters will receive special mention in the initial release of AnalysIR.
 

The Impact
There are hundreds of millions of discarded TV type remote controls in the world. We found a total of 17 in our own home. Our involvement with IR was inspired by the Arduino community and began with an idea to reduce the waste associated with remote controls. We hope that your support for our campaign will help in reducing this waste in the future.
 
We also believe that AnalysIR will prove to be a great tool for electronics labs within the Education sector, a must have accessory for MakerSpaces, Robotics & Electronics clubs and will also save countless hours for professionals configuring & troubleshooting complex TV & media installations.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Remember, if you can't back us directly, you can still help by referencing AnalysIR on your social media, blog or website. Using the share tools on Indiegogo is another excellent way of helping us out. You can also follow us on twitter via @AnalysIR.
 
We will also include a special credit to our top ‘Noise Makers’ in the initial release of AnalysIR.
 
Thanks in advance.....from the AnalysIR team.
 

Future Roadmap
If we exceed our minimum target as outlined above, we will organise a vote among backers on a selection of new features to include in AnalysIR, for example a subset of:


Additional IR Protocol support

Note: The names above refer to the IR Protocol and not necessarily a device name, as many manufacturers rebrand devices made by 3rd party companies, even the big ones.
 
Q3) Why not just use an Oscilloscope or Logic Analyzer?
Ask any of our team, we have a good Oscilloscope to help us out on certain electrical or analogue challenges, but the first choice is always AnalysIR when it comes to IR decoding, analysis and troubleshooting.
 
We have priced the perks which compare favourably to the cost of entry level Oscilloscopes ($300+) or Logic Analyzers ($150+). Oh and did we mention that AnalysIR is far superior at a fraction of the cost for our backers. We would be happy to put AnalysIR head-to-head against the most expensive Oscilloscopes or Logic Analyzers on the market, for IR protocol analysis & decoding.
 
Q4) What projects can I use AnalysIR with?
The list is literally endless, because IR can be used to control almost any device on the planet. Here is a small sample:


Low cost Teaching aid as part of your Lab - everyone can have their own decoder


Helicopter remote Control


Robotics


Indoor ‘Toy Car’ control (Don’t try it with a real car, particularly indoors!)


Get your iPhone, Android, Tablet, MCU, PC or Server to control your devices using IR.


Control your 3D printer or CNC machine


Garage door opener / closer


Control motors including stepper motors


Door Opener


Pet Door opener


A practical way to teach students about Electronics & Binary/Hex notation.


Wireless serial communications between Arduino and computer


Control any Arduino type project (Also Raspberry Pi or any MCU)


Access the service menu of your TV. (Some TVs can be upgraded for free. NB: Warranty)


Replace your Air Conditioning remote and control remotely


Mood lighting control


Update LED displays & Electronic Notice-boards


Not to mention, where we began, you can dream up any number of projects to do with TV remote control. (we have our own unique project underway in this area)


IR can provide optical isolation between an Arduino and relay circuit.


Camera control, time-lapse, movement detection, flash synchronisation or just remote snapping


In summary, IR is the cheapest indoor method to control a device located within the same room and is extremely reliable, at a small fraction of the cost of wired, Wi-Fi, LAN, ZigBee or other RF systems. And guess what - you probably have several spare controllers already available.
 
Q5) Is AnalysIR Open-Source?
We will release all of the MCU code (Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc) to backers without restrictions as to use, which is more liberal than OS. We hope this will encourage the release of 3rd party kits & devices for AnalysIR. However, we are not in a position to release the windows based code at this time. We will revisit this again in the future. We do publish the protocol timings & parameters for each supported protocol within the application itself.
 
Q6) How does registration work?
When the campaign completes we will issue registration keys in 2 phases, as described above. You will receive a registration key, via email, which will be tied to a single PC and the registration email.
 
Q7) What is included?
Everything you need for a working AnalysIR, Software for PC and MCU, Getting Started Guide & Video, backed up by online support. You need to provide the MCU (e.g. Arduino or Raspberry Pi etc) and the IR receiver yourself. We can help with arranging kits after the campaign ends, as necessary. AnalysIR is designed to work with a minimum screen resolution of 1366x768 along with the latest windows updates.
 
Q8) How much will AnalysIR cost after the campaign ends?
We have not decided yet, but we expect it will sell for at least 50-100% more than the perks.
 
Q9) How do I set up AnalysIR?
Setting up is simple, with just 3 connections. Connect the yellow wire to pin 2 on the Arduino, Red to 5V, Green to GND. Check the connections and confirm the pin-out of your IR receiver from the datasheet. Then just simply connect the MCU to your PC, start the AnalysIR application and follow the instructions in the Getting Started Guide. (Note: you will be able to set up other Arduino Models, Raspberry Pi, Pic, MSP, AVR etc by just copying the code provided for your platform. We plan to publish code for these platforms as part of this campaign, as discussed above.) A breadboard is not required, as the IR receiver can be wired directly to the Arduino.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>SkyBell is the smartest video doorbell and the ""eyes and ears"" of the SmartHome.  By letting you see who is at your door, you can answer the door on your terms and enjoy a whole new level of convenience and awareness. </p>
<p>The most powerful feature is our motion sensor.  We're making it possible for SkyBell to start a video feed even without the visitor pressing the button.  This is perfect for when a user knocks, or when someone is loitering on your doorstep for whatever reason.  You can turn the motion sensor on or off, depending on your needs.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How It Works</b></p>
<p>SkyBell is designed to replace your current doorbell and it uses your current doorbell's power lines for direct power.  When a visitor presses the button, SkyBell sends you a push notification alert.  If you decide to answer it, you'll see, hear and speak to your visitor from your mobile devices.  The visitor at your door can hear you and speak back to you with SkyBell's speaker and microphone. The device itself connects to your home's WiFi network and it sends the live video to your mobile devices over WiFi and 4G cellular networks.  </p>

<h4><b>More than just a doorbell with a video camera</b></h4>
<p>SkyBell is the smart video doorbell with a <b>motion sensor</b>. This means you can receive alerts and video feeds whether or not your visitor presses the button.   Because SkyBell has full time power, it can stay in ""alert"" mode and start a video feed quickly.  </p>
<p>SkyBell also has an exclusive <b>On-Demand feature</b>.  This allows you to open the SkyBell video camera directly from the app and see live video, whether or not someone presses the button. This is perfect for when you're away and you want to check on your home, if someone knocks or if you hear something.  </p>
<p><b>SkyBell is the smart video doorbell for the smart home.</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>Mobile devices give us the freedom to stay connected while on the go. We're taking that to a new level by designing a beautiful and easy to use app that lets you answer your door no matter where you are or what you're doing.  The app allows you to sea, hear and speak to your visitor. You can also capture a ""screenshot"" of the video feed and end the call.</p>
<p><b>The SkyBell app is free and will be available for compatible iOS and Android devices.</b> We designed the app with the end user in mind. After all, we are the end user.  We've designed features that we want and we know you'll like.  One example is the ""Silent Mode.""  This allow you to turn off your home's doorbell chime from the app, so you are not disturbed. This is perfect for sleeping babies, responsive dogs and for naps.</p>

<p><b>Award-Winning Design</b></p>
<p>SkyBell was named as a prestigious ""CES Innovations Award"" Nominee in 2014. This is only given to the most innovative and well-designed devices at CES. </p>
<p>SkyBell was designed with a minimal design aesthetic and a small form factor.  It's deliberately designed to have a minimal visual impact and to look like a normal doorbell.  The brushed aluminum finish matches most wall and home furnishings and we have a new ""Oil Rubbed Bronze"" finish.</p>

<p>The SkyBell team is passionate about creating groundbreaking technologies that fit right into our digital lifestyles.  We have a proven track record.  Our team has previously designed, developed and manufactured the world's leading consumer and commercial GPS tracking devices.  These devices have been distributed by some of the largest retailers in the world, including Apple®.  We were told it was impossible to build the first single-board GPS device and found a way. Those devices are now either on shelves or being used by some of the most well know companies around the world. </p>
<p>We are fortunate for these past experience which have now reduced the learning curve for this project.  Our team of engineers and production designers are experienced in developing and manufacturing consumer technology.  This includes the design and development of hardware, software, mobile apps and retail packaging.  It also includes manufacturing and distribution.  </p>
<h4>We know that every project has it's challenges.  We're confident that our experience helps us know what to expect and how to handle the unexpected! </h4>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><i>Will it work for my home?</i></strong></p>
<p><i>SkyBell is designed to replace your current doorbell.  SkyBell needs three things to be able to work for your door: power, space and WiFi connection.</i></p>
<p><i>1) Direct Power - SkyBell requires direct power for consistent power for the advanced features.  Please check to make sure your current doorbell has power. If your current doorbell does not have power, you can run power to the spot on the wall where you'd like SkyBell. </i></p>
<p><i>2) A Little Space - SkyBell is small but it still needs a little space.  SkyBell works best with 3"" (7.2cm) of circular space to fit. </i></p>
<p><i>3) WiFi Connection - SkyBell requires full time internet access via a B/G/N wireless network with 2.4GHz network, 20 MHz bandwidth and WPA security.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Will there be an Android App?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, SkyBell works on select Android devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Do I need power?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, SkyBell will only work with direct power to your home's transformer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I use two devices on my house?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you can have more than one device on the same house, on the same network and in the same account.  They can all alert the same smartphones.  You can also have them on different houses as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What power standards does SkyBell work with?</strong></p>
<p>SkyBell works with your current doorbell’s voltage transformer. The Primary power in is 120/130 VAC or 220/230/240 VAC.  SkyBell can receive secondary power from the transformer to the device at 10 – 36 VAC 10 VAC.  SkyBell works with a mechanical doorbell chime ""as-is"" and with a digital doorbell chime with the adapter.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Will my regular doorbell chime still work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, SkyBell will allow a doorbell chime to make the traditional ""ding-dong"" sound in your home.  You can even turn your doorbell sound on or off from the app. This is great for sleeping babies, working from home and the night shift. You can chose if you want the app alerts, home chime, neither or both.  SkyBell is the only video doorbell that is compatible with mechanical and digital doorbell chimes.  SkyBell is not compatible with wireless doorbells.</p>

SkyBell is the smartest video doorbell and the ""eyes and ears"" of the SmartHome.  By letting you see who is at your door, you can answer the door on your terms and enjoy a whole new level of convenience and awareness. 
The most powerful feature is our motion sensor.  We're making it possible for SkyBell to start a video feed even without the visitor pressing the button.  This is perfect for when a user knocks, or when someone is loitering on your doorstep for whatever reason.  You can turn the motion sensor on or off, depending on your needs.









How It Works
SkyBell is designed to replace your current doorbell and it uses your current doorbell's power lines for direct power.  When a visitor presses the button, SkyBell sends you a push notification alert.  If you decide to answer it, you'll see, hear and speak to your visitor from your mobile devices.  The visitor at your door can hear you and speak back to you with SkyBell's speaker and microphone. The device itself connects to your home's WiFi network and it sends the live video to your mobile devices over WiFi and 4G cellular networks.  







More than just a doorbell with a video camera
SkyBell is the smart video doorbell with a motion sensor. This means you can receive alerts and video feeds whether or not your visitor presses the button.   Because SkyBell has full time power, it can stay in ""alert"" mode and start a video feed quickly.  
SkyBell also has an exclusive On-Demand feature.  This allows you to open the SkyBell video camera directly from the app and see live video, whether or not someone presses the button. This is perfect for when you're away and you want to check on your home, if someone knocks or if you hear something.  
SkyBell is the smart video doorbell for the smart home.






Mobile devices give us the freedom to stay connected while on the go. We're taking that to a new level by designing a beautiful and easy to use app that lets you answer your door no matter where you are or what you're doing.  The app allows you to sea, hear and speak to your visitor. You can also capture a ""screenshot"" of the video feed and end the call.
The SkyBell app is free and will be available for compatible iOS and Android devices. We designed the app with the end user in mind. After all, we are the end user.  We've designed features that we want and we know you'll like.  One example is the ""Silent Mode.""  This allow you to turn off your home's doorbell chime from the app, so you are not disturbed. This is perfect for sleeping babies, responsive dogs and for naps.


























Award-Winning Design
SkyBell was named as a prestigious ""CES Innovations Award"" Nominee in 2014. This is only given to the most innovative and well-designed devices at CES. 
SkyBell was designed with a minimal design aesthetic and a small form factor.  It's deliberately designed to have a minimal visual impact and to look like a normal doorbell.  The brushed aluminum finish matches most wall and home furnishings and we have a new ""Oil Rubbed Bronze"" finish.
 








SkyBell means more to us than the next great tech gadget.  We believe SkyBell will help parents, families, caregivers and businesses stay connected with big parts of their lives.  We hope SkyBell is another way for technology to make one part of everyday life just a little easier.  
We are passionate about creating useful technologies that are easy to use...and we work hard to do it.  We believe in creating reliable and quality products that are built with the world's best materials and components...right here in the USA!  We have an unyielding commitment to quality, minimal design and a friendly user experience.






The SkyBell team is passionate about creating groundbreaking technologies that fit right into our digital lifestyles.  We have a proven track record.  Our team has previously designed, developed and manufactured the world's leading consumer and commercial GPS tracking devices.  These devices have been distributed by some of the largest retailers in the world, including Apple®.  We were told it was impossible to build the first single-board GPS device and found a way. Those devices are now either on shelves or being used by some of the most well know companies around the world. 
We are fortunate for these past experience which have now reduced the learning curve for this project.  Our team of engineers and production designers are experienced in developing and manufacturing consumer technology.  This includes the design and development of hardware, software, mobile apps and retail packaging.  It also includes manufacturing and distribution.  
We know that every project has it's challenges.  We're confident that our experience helps us know what to expect and how to handle the unexpected!

<p></p></div>","Every
day.
What
would the world look like, after a week? 
A
month? 
A
year? 
Imagine.
Gratitapp is a simple, no-cost,
cloud-based app that does two things;
1)
Helps you live a life of greater gratitude by reminding you 1, 2, or 3 times a
day to enter your gratitude.  
2)
And here’s the brilliant twist.  When you
write your gratitude for someone else, Gratitapp lets them know via text, email
or if they have the app, a Gratitapp!  ""You’ve got a
gratitapp!""
Chris wrote, 'I so glad I met Carol, she is
the most thoughtful friend I know.’""

Imagine
you are Carol in the note above.  How
would it feel to know someone is thinking such warm thoughts about you?
“It’s like getting a
‘Thinking of You card’ every time I open my phone”This will be a cool, full-featured gratitude journal.  It will work across all platforms and on all your devices.  But again, the really big idea is Gratitapp will share gratitude for others, with others.  Gratitapp will make gratitude viral. 
Studies
have shown the simple act of noting what you’re grateful for is the most
impactful thing you can do to increase your own happiness.  Now its time to share happiness and
gratitude.  
Imagine
as Gratitapp spreads through
churches…
Social
networks…
Thought
leaders, experts and gurus…
Schools…
From
person to person, family to family, each day adding user after user as one
person after another shares their gratitude with the people in their life. 
This
can be the most viral, largest relationship builder in history.
So Why a Crowdfunding
campaign?
We
said the app would be free.  No-cost for
something like this is simply the right thing to do.  But making the app takes time and
talent.  We want it to be right. We want
it to work across operating systems (Apple, Android, etc.) and across
devices  (Smartphones, tablets, laptops,
desktops) and that takes money. 
So
to do this right we want your help. 
Donate at any level and we will guarantee two things.  
1)  You will among the first users to get a copy of the Gratitapp
when it's finished.
2)  You are guaranteed at least
one Gratitapp from our founders when you open the app.  
And if you can’t donate please pass the word along.
We will be forever grateful!  
Join us in what promises to
be the most viral, largest relationship builder in human history.                     
Who we are.  
As
you saw from the video, this literal “application of gratitude” is the idea of
three people;This
super team has reached out and engaged the help of additional partners
including;
So
join these inspired leaders and our many supporters in making Gratitapp a
reality and spreading Gratitude around the world. How
You Can Join in:

<p><b>Our Story:</b></p>
<p>My name is Sam Beck, creator of the Bra-ket.  As a real estate Broker I literally wear my phone on  my body at all times.  I can't even
open a home without my cell phone, but guess what? I had a problem that all woman share...Women's clothing has NO pockets!!!   So what did I do? Like many other women, I used my bra as a pocket for my phone, because it was the most
convenient and discreet place for storage! (and I wear a bra with every outfit)
But, carrying a cell phone in a bra creates another problem, which is the
potential danger of having an electronic device close to the skin, especially
tender breast tissue.  Both the Radio frequency and heat put off from a
phone are major concerns in recent findings.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">       </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/862063/files/20140916133456-RF_danger_sign.jpg?1410899696"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 113.793103448276px; height: 150px; background-color: initial;""/>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/862074/files/20140916133910-hot_iphone.jpg?1410899950"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 165.333333333333px; height: 124px; background-color: initial;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/862089/files/20140916134206-thermal_cell_phone_image.jpg?1410900126"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 169.838323353293px; height: 113px; background-color: initial;""/></p><h4>

<p>As the huge debate wages on in both the media and medical worlds, The Bra-ket proactively solves the problems of convenience AND safety. </p>
<p>Your
first reaction to ""The Bra-ket"" may be to laugh a little. That's
okay!  In fact, the idea of The Bra-ket started from friends and family
making fun of me for always carrying my phone  in my bra and calling it
my ""Bra-ket"" (short for Bra pocket)  Behind all the jokes
though, I was secretly terrified that perhaps using my bra as a pocket for my
phone was dangerous!  Like many of you, my life has been personally
affected by breast cancer.  My own mother is a survivor.  I don't know a
woman who isn't scared of this disease and yet I see women every day who carry
their phones in their bras, despite the possible danger. Why?.... Convenience
sake.  My business partner, Katie and I thought there must be a way to provide
both safety and convenience while allowing a phone signal,  and after much
research, design and testing, we now have BRA-KET LAUNCH!</p>

The Initial design and independent testing are complete and we have an amazing result in The Bra-ket!  Our first few limited production runs are complete and our market test has been very successful.  Our community of ""Bra-keteers"" is growing daily! To this point, we have paid for all the costs, but now, to really make a difference,  spread this message and get a Bra-ket into the hands of every woman that needs one, we need your help!
How your contribution will make a difference: 

Your contribution will have a great impact on our ability to get a  Bra-ket into women's hands, even if it's just one woman at a time. Together we can get this message and this product out to the women of the world who tuck their phones into their only reliable storage pocket... their bra!  Whether your contribution is monetary or by just sharing our page with the indiegogo share tools, your contribution is extremely valuable. The magnitude of what we can achieve with your help could be astounding!  Be a part of this movement with us! Let's make some noise and be pro-active about practicing safe cell.  Thank you SO much!
What's the money for?
If you don't have experience bringing a product to market, it's difficult to imagine how quickly the costs add up and the expense involved in every step.   While we are working our hardest to keep costs low, there are some that just can't be avoided.  Here are some of the primary ones:
* Continued Patent and trademark protection
* Marketing, advertising, and distribution
* Improved Packaging for more efficient display and shipping
* Continued Research and Development to ensure high quality products and gain        traction ahead of the competition
* Larger production runs, manufacturing, and QA
* Offer a wider variety of colors and designs 

    



Risks and Challenges:

One of the greatest risks we face right now is shortage of funds.  We are currently growing, and a successful campaign would allow us to knock this out of the park.  We have already had successful limited production runs and our supply chain and logistics are near perfect but, will change as we grow.  If we don't meet our funding goal, we will continue to manufacture and distribute The Bra-kets to the best of our financial ability.  We feel extremely committed to ""The Bra-ket movement""  and believe it is incredibly important to provide availability of The Bra-ket for all women who ""tuck and stash"" in their bra.
Can't Contribute now? 

Even if you can't contribute now, please use the Indiegogo share buttons and help us spread the message of The Bra-ket movement.  Finally, there is a safer way to carry your cell phone.  Imagine the peace of mind you can share with your friends and family. Let's make some noise and make it socially unacceptable for a woman to have her phone in her bra without a Bra-ket!  Thank you sincerely, Your ""Breast Friends"" at the Bra-ket!",16.0,0,"2 Campaigns

We designed a PCB (hub and SATA adapter) and a case that offers many advantages :In addition we thought you would love the following features as well:- Front LED- Front USB- SD Card easy access- Fan place holder in the enclosure + power connector on the PCBSince we know most of you are electronics lovers we left you a space in the back for your GPIO cable and camera ribbon :-) So we turn this...Into that...DesignOne of the most important things to us is the design - we wanted the Plusberry to be as pretty as possible, so it would be ""living-room worthy"".We went through many iterations - from a simple box-like prototype, through many different concepts till we settled to the final product.For a 3D model play this one:

What will the funds be used for?We need most of the money in order to pay for the tooling.The remaining funds will be used for sourcing components such PCB & electronics part, assembly &testing, packaging &shipping.ScheduleUpdated time line -PCBs assembly - 5/5Plastics first trial - 4/30Plastics second trial - 5/11Shipping - 5/25The RewardsWhen you pledge, you get a complete Plusberry Pi kit, containing:

<h3>Taste Matters</h3>
<p>When we first started developing Toasteroid, we promised ourselves that no matter how the final product came out with however many fun and fancy features, the toasts it makes needed to be tasty with the perfect crunch. And we have done just that. Every piece of toast Toasteroid makes is a wonderful combination of external crunch and internal softness. <b>Extra brownness is available for all bread types with its extra long and wide slot.</b></p>

<h3>The Toasteroid Difference</h3>
<p>Toasteroid’s smart toasting system is powered by high density micro-filament heating technology (patent pending). This innovative heating system is responsible for 1) spreading heat evenly on the surface of the bread during toasting and 2) printing images on the actual toast.</p>
<div data-id=""13284978""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1475003021/lxsduvitpyfiersfae4i.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Regular toasters have a very uneven heating distribution, which results in uneven doneness of the toast. Commonly, this affects the overall crunch of the toast, but in more serious cases, some parts of your toast can be burnt while other parts are still soft. Toasteroid completely eliminates this problem with its micro-filament heating technology, which spreads heat evenly. The graphic below shows the internal temperatures of the bread being toasted in Toasteroid and a regular toaster.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xs12YBhAStXTqw/source.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","Toasteroid is NOT just a toaster. An ordinary toaster turns bread brown and that’s the ONLY thing a toaster can do. Toasteroid can be your personal Weather Forecaster, Private Messenger, and Doodle Pad. It can do all of the above with simple commands from your smartphone and still make the most perfect piece of toast you’ve ever had.It’s time to say adiós to your old toaster, and bring Toasteroid home!Toasting superheroes on bread is nothing new. Anyone can do it with a single-logo stamping toaster as long as you’re willing to eat the same old superhero toast for the rest of eternity. Why limit ourselves to that? Toasteroid gives you the freedom to print any superhero or villain you want. Or you can use the Toasteroid companion app to design and print your very own.  
Making toast with Toasteroid is super easy. Just download the Toasteroid companion mobile app, connect your smart phone to Toasteroid via Bluetooth and toast away!  Toasteroid is equipped with awesome features that prepares you for every part of your day. Printing custom images on your toast is just the beginning. Toasteroid can give you the weather forecast, help you interact with your friends in a fun new way via toast messages, and controls the brownness of your toast like never before. To add a little bit more fun and to protect your privacy, all of the toast messages received can only be read on toast.
  

 
A good “toast” should be short, sweet and meaningful! That’s how we make toasts with Toasteroid! Type in any text you want in the app to customize your toast! Tasty sandwiches with meaningful messages - what’s not to love?

 

 
We know you need better incentives to justify ditching your old toaster, so lets check out some fun ways to use Toasteroid!

 
Most of Toasteroid’s features are unique and one of a kind. Not only is Toasteroid fun, it does an amazing job at making toast too. 

 
 Make Awesome Breakfast!

 
Let's Compare

 

 
Toasteroid, with its curved die-cast aluminum body and minimal design, can match with any counter top. From modern and futuristic to cozy and rustic kitchens, Toasteroid’s timeless design fits anywhere.

 
The perfect addition to your smart home collection

 

 
Taste Matters
When we first started developing Toasteroid, we promised ourselves that no matter how the final product came out with however many fun and fancy features, the toasts it makes needed to be tasty with the perfect crunch. And we have done just that. Every piece of toast Toasteroid makes is a wonderful combination of external crunch and internal softness. Extra brownness is available for all bread types with its extra long and wide slot.

 
Initial Sketch & Development:

The Toasteroid Difference
Toasteroid’s smart toasting system is powered by high density micro-filament heating technology (patent pending). This innovative heating system is responsible for 1) spreading heat evenly on the surface of the bread during toasting and 2) printing images on the actual toast.

Regular toasters have a very uneven heating distribution, which results in uneven doneness of the toast. Commonly, this affects the overall crunch of the toast, but in more serious cases, some parts of your toast can be burnt while other parts are still soft. Toasteroid completely eliminates this problem with its micro-filament heating technology, which spreads heat evenly. The graphic below shows the internal temperatures of the bread being toasted in Toasteroid and a regular toaster.
 
 
The Software

Making Custom images is just as easy. Select the Custom Image option from the main menu and start doodling! You can also use this option to write custom messages, reminders, and greetings too!
 

We cannot do it without your participation! JOIN US on this Toaster Revolution today and enjoy a unique breakfast experience ahead of everyone else.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>While most 3D printers use an inflexible Cartesian platform, the Blacksmith Genesis uses a rotating platform, similar to how a record player plays. This efficient mechanical design halves the distance that the extruder needs to move, making Blacksmith Genesis more compact than traditional 3D printer designs while still being able to print large objects. This feature also makes it perfect for integrating 3D scanning.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Technical FAQ</em></p>
<p><b>Why
isn’t there a heated bed?</b></p>
<p>A heated
bed is usually used for supporting ABS construction, and is operated at high
temperatures. We designed the printer to be used with PLA. All of the sample
prints to date were done without a heated bed and there has not been any issues
with adhesion.</p>
<p><b>Where
do I get replacement filaments when the Indiegogo campaign is over?</b></p>
<p>We will
be offering filament cartridges on our website after the campaign.</p>
<p><b>Is the
printing material toxic?</b></p>
<p>The
filament Blacksmith Genesis uses is PLA which is a safe, non-toxic, environmentally
friendly, and biodegradable thermoplastic.</p>
<p><b>How can
you get such a high build volume with such a small machine size?</b></p>
<p>Unlike
ordinary 3D printers which use a gantry system, our patent-pending rotary
printing technology enables the print-head to print without the need of extra
room to move around, which gives a very efficient print area :). Take a look at
the comparison we made above.</p>
<p><b>How
long does it take to print something?</b></p>
<p>How large, solid, and detailed you want the object to be dictates the build time. Smaller objects can take as short as 15 minutes while larger objects with high percentage of filling can take a few hours.</p>
<p><b>How
long does it take to scan something?</b></p>
<p>The
scan speed is not dependent on the scanned object's size but
rather on the quality of the scan you require. It can vary from as fast as 3
minutes to 30 minutes for a better and higher resolution.</p>
<p><b>Is
there anything that I cannot scan?</b></p>
<p>Genesis may not be able to scan objects with surfaces that are hidden from the camera. Translucent, reflective, or black/near-black objects do not scan well. However, there are procedures to overcome this! For example, users may apply a layer of talcum powder to the problematic surface to prime the surface for a good scan.</p>
<p><b>What
are the ways I can use the machine?</b></p>
<p>Our
favorite way would be to start printing using either the software on the
computer or the LCD on the machine, and use our smartphone to take a peek of
the printing process when we are away.</p>
<p><b>What
platforms can I use Blacksmith Genesis on?</b></p>
<p>You can
use it technically on any platform as our amazing software is Web-based!</p>
<p><b>What
file formats does Blacksmith Genesis support?</b></p>
<p>Blacksmith
Genesis accepts .stl and .obj files.</p>
<p><b>Is
Blacksmith Genesis compatible with other 3D modeling software?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
Blacksmith Genesis is compatible with any 3D modeling software that can produce
.stl or .obj files.</p>

PRINTING AT MAXIMUM WIDTH
Scroll down to watch 3 more new videos, or click here for our YouTube channel.As seen on...3D Printers are awesome, but current machines in the market only
provide half the solution. Inventing a new object is difficult for the
non-professional who has little or no experience in design, let alone the
complicated software it requires to realize a sketch into a 3D file.
Meet Blacksmith Genesis.

By combining the function of a 3D scanner and a 3D printer into
one compact machine, Blacksmith Genesis and our software Blacksmith Sorcerer allow you to scan your everyday
object, modify it to your liking, and create a new invention easily. With this feature, users may create and print 3D objects even without extensive 3D printing knowledge. 

We do
the rest, so that you can focus on inventing.









Blacksmith's innovative technology integrates 3D printing and 3D scanning capabilities into a single system. You save cost without buying two separate systems!  Plus, Blacksmith Genesis provides the ease of creating 3D models by scanning physical objects. The digitized objects can then be modified and combined via Blacksmith Sorcerer to form a new unique 3D object.





While most 3D printers use an inflexible Cartesian platform, the Blacksmith Genesis uses a rotating platform, similar to how a record player plays. This efficient mechanical design halves the distance that the extruder needs to move, making Blacksmith Genesis more compact than traditional 3D printer designs while still being able to print large objects. This feature also makes it perfect for integrating 3D scanning.




 Blacksmith Genesis comes with an in-built camera that provides automatic error detection during printing as well as off-site monitoring via your smartphone. This means you have full control of your machine without being physically present. Should you wish to stop printing, you can do so at the click of a button—anytime, anywhere.









Designed for home and
office use, our machine is sleek and space saving. With an effective print area of 57%, Blacksmith Genesis can easily fit
next to your desktop computer and other equipment or appliances.






While maintaining the small machine size, we are able to provide industrial standard build volume. This means no compromise on magnitude of large prototypes! 



Through its LCD monitor, the machine is able to print files directly from SD cards without the use of an external computer. 







Blacksmith Genesis’
hardware and software is designed for everyone to use, even without extensive
3D printing knowledge. There will be minimal installation procedures to get
your printer up and running, and controls are easy to operate.








Yup, free shipping to 70 countries. Please refer to FAQ for delivery duration. 












Campaign Goal and Use of Contributions Our goal is to raise sufficient funds for the manufacturing of Blacksmith Genesis.

Custom moulds for plastic parts
Custom moulds for casing
Blacksmith Kraken - a custom-designed fail-resistant print head
SmithBoard V5 - An integrated printing, scanning, and network communication electronic module

A small part of the contribution will also be channelled to developing a modelling software that combines both 3D search engine and editing. We want users to enjoy an immersive experience in creating and printing their invention, made possible by a seamless partnership of our hardware and software.

<h3>Thoughtful Design </h3>
<p>This cable was not only designed small and slim, but also performs the best for great stretch and complete collapse. Through our series of studies, we found a unique cutting pattern that gives us the best result for performance. We designed it with complete space efficiency in mind. The space for the cable and connector over mold has been precisely allocated for the entire volume to mitigate the total area.</p>

<p><b>Silicone exhibits many useful characteristics, including: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>High tensile strength </li>
<li>Low thermal conductivity </li>
<li>Low chemical reactivity </li>
<li>Low toxicity Thermal stability (constancy of properties over a wide temperature range of −100 to 250 °C). </li>
<li>The ability to repel water </li>
<li>Does not stick to many substrates, but adheres very well to others, e.g. glass. </li>
<li>Does not support microbiological growth. </li>
<li>Electrical insulation properties. Because silicone can be formulated to be electrically insulative or conductive, it is suitable for a wide range of electrical applications. </li>

<br/><h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>It took months for all of our designers and tooling engineers to collaborate and develop the CONNEX™-cable requiring significant contribution for refinement of the cable. The most comprehensive solution was accomplished after much iteration to get a final design.</p>
<p>The flexible flat type cable needs a complex Silicon/Plastic over-molding process. If the material condition is not appropriate for its functionality, we will immediately investigate and re-optimize the process for the best result adjusting tooling and material property. Our goal is to eliminate nearly of all the issues before starting production so that we can present you with the perfect device. Our aim is to give our customers the best possible product with the CONNEX™-cable, with no compromises.</p>
<p>Our team is very capable of managing issues associated with product development and production. However, if challenging circumstances occur that require an immediate reaction to get manufacturing back on track, we will immediately inform our backers of what has happened and what should be done, etc. We will still be able to fulfill our commitment and achieve the progress expected. If we encounter quality related issues, we will employ the most efficient solutions to avoid any major impact with regards to delivery of the device.</p>

</div><br/></div>","The CONNEX™-cable, is a smart cable that improves on the design of existing cables, being shorter (which prevents tangles), but not so short as to make it difficult to use. Thanks to the Silicone's elasticity and physical strength, it can stretch and gives you a great deal of flexibility to connect devices at a distance and awkward uneven port level, and immediately returns to its original form!




 
 


A CARD-shaped Self-COLLAPSIBLE Data/Charging CABLE : Eliminate Clunky, Annoying Cords for Good!






 It's broadly agreed nearly every cable for smart devices leaves a great deal to be desired. Most are too long, which leads to tangles and other headaches while others are simply too short. Our CONNEX™-cable boldly responds to this problem with the size of a credit card and effortlessly connects your digital devices for transferring data and charging. This new solution will eliminate the current annoyances of your tangling and bulky wire cables and those extra short length cables.


Data Transfer (Phone, Tablet, Camera, Speaker, Navigation Device, Laptop, Mac, PC, etc.) 

Device Charging (Phone, Tablet, Camera, Power Bank, Speaker, etc) 

Mitigating Hassles (Tangles, Irritations, Frustrations, and so on)

Traditional charging and data cables are about 3 feet 5 inches (3'5""), which can cause you inconveniences that are just unnecessary. A cable of this length is prone to easy tangling with other cables like your earphones and peripheral’s cords. This can cause one big tangling mess!








Thanks to the Ultra-Durable Silicone's elasticity and physical strength, the cable immediately returns to its original form!


We offer both an Apple Lightning Connector version for all Apple product connectivity; iMac, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, iPod AND a Micro USB connector version for most Android devices and PC.




The CONNEX™-cable is the most creative universal cable providing an easy compact tangle-free solution that you can personalize. You can draw and put other forms of art on the cable. It's a great fun way to express yourself! Enhance with a logo or your own design! It is a fun way to have it filled with doodle, sketches and other flights of ink-filled fancy.









There is a wide array of colors to suit your preferences and match all of your devices. This is ultimate convenience with style.Each product will be individually packaged for the proper protection.


 No more worries about tangling cables! Its slim and small form-factor will fit in the smallest of places nicely like your wallet, trouser pocket, and anywhere else you want to carry it around in. It is a truly small and nifty!
It Fits!


It hangs!


...and it even holds your place in a book!



It Stretches!   

It can stretch for your convenience and gives you a great deal of flexibility to connect devices within 18 inches, at any angle and even those awkward uneven surfaces. This product works with you, not against you!



It Connects!  



This cable is all about the connectivity between digital devices with USB-A and Micro USB OR USB-A and Lightning Connector.

Most stick type (a.k.a Key chain) short length charging cables are limited to connecting devices at a distance and uneven port levels OR to charge devices from the wall outlet.
Thoughtful Design 
This cable was not only designed small and slim, but also performs the best for great stretch and complete collapse. Through our series of studies, we found a unique cutting pattern that gives us the best result for performance. We designed it with complete space efficiency in mind. The space for the cable and connector over mold has been precisely allocated for the entire volume to mitigate the total area.



Along with its elasticity and physical strength, our design solution also helps it to prevent rips and tears.




Superb Material
CONNEX™-cable is made of Ultra-Durable Synthetic Silicone for great stretch and perfect collapse. Flexible to your every need!


Silicone exhibits many useful characteristics, including: 

High tensile strength 
Low thermal conductivity 
Low chemical reactivity 
Low toxicity Thermal stability (constancy of properties over a wide temperature range of −100 to 250 °C). 
The ability to repel water 
Does not stick to many substrates, but adheres very well to others, e.g. glass. 
Does not support microbiological growth. 
Electrical insulation properties. Because silicone can be formulated to be electrically insulative or conductive, it is suitable for a wide range of electrical applications.

Risks and challenges
It took months for all of our designers and tooling engineers to collaborate and develop the CONNEX™-cable requiring significant contribution for refinement of the cable. The most comprehensive solution was accomplished after much iteration to get a final design.
The flexible flat type cable needs a complex Silicon/Plastic over-molding process. If the material condition is not appropriate for its functionality, we will immediately investigate and re-optimize the process for the best result adjusting tooling and material property. Our goal is to eliminate nearly of all the issues before starting production so that we can present you with the perfect device. Our aim is to give our customers the best possible product with the CONNEX™-cable, with no compromises.

<p>Our idea is to create a story for iPad and iPhone that is not only pretty, but also carries old popular wisdom. We chose the The Big Beet tale because it is a simple story with a great message. It features a variety of characters and teaches children about the importance of helping each other; even the smallest one can contribute to the Greater Good.</p>
<p>In addition, we also create fairy tale games. They help kids to develop their skills and abilities. In play, children can remember the story better. Our fairy tales will be recorded in several languages so that it can be read and listened to by as many children as possible.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #f06;"">Our mission</span></p>
<p>We see, there is a lot of modern fairy tales nowadays, many of which, unlike the classic fairy tales, are missing something important; The classic fairy tale provides a child with a certain kind of knowledge and helps him or her orient in the real world and better understand it. Within the fairy tales scenes and images there is a true fortune in common sense , moral values, interpersonal relationships, social convention, experiences and human touch. The fairy tale is able to pass this naturally to a child in a language that s/he understands.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #f06;"">Why the Big Beet?</span></p>
<p>The Big Beet fairy tale is an old-time Slavic story about an old man who planted a beet. This beet grew but, in the end, it was so big that he could not pull it out. He then called his wife, granddaughter, a dog and a cat to help him. But they still were not able to pull the beet out. Finally, a little mouse gave them a hand and together they managed to pull it out successfully.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thebigbeet.com/images/igg/thebigbeet.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have chosen this story for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a simple story; therefore even the smallest children can understand it. Cute pictures and cheerful music enhance the experience from the story and children will be keen on getting back to it.</li>
<li>This tale features several different characters, enriching the story with diversity which gives us an opportunity for creating various games the children can have a lot of fun with, and, at the same time, it gives the children a chance to learn something.</li>
<li>The story also advises the children that it is important to help each other no matter how big or small the person or act is (the old man and the mouse) or how different their world views or believes are (the dog, cat and the mouse). When there is a problem, they all come together and get the problem solved.</li>

He then called his wife, granddaughter, a dog and a cat to help him. But they still were not able to pull the beet out.

The story also advises the children that it is important to help each other no matter how big or small the person or act is (the old man and the mouse) or how different their world views or believes are (the dog, cat and the mouse). When there is a problem, they all come together and get the problem solved.

<h1>FAQ's</h1><p><br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>What about ring
sizes? When do backers get to choose their ring size?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ fits small and large fingers alike due to the detachable back-section
of ThumbTrack™ being made from a flexible rubber-like material. <br/><br/>
We provide all backers with 3 differently sized back-flaps (S, M, L) to
guarantee a 100% snug fit. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ available for left-handers?</b> <br/><br/>
The device can be worn either on your left or right hand without restrictions
in usability. <br/><br/><br/><b>What material is ThumbTrack™ made of?</b> <br/><br/>
The surface part and some inner structural parts of the thick section are made
from ABS plastic. The thinner section is made from a rubber-like material and
the whole inner lining as well as the sides are rubberized. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ waterproof?</b> <br/><br/>
The device is resistant to sweat and the occasional splash. <br/><br/><br/><b>What colors does the ThumbTrack™ come in?</b> <br/><br/>
The device is available in Pitch Black and Pure White. <br/><br/><br/><b>What kind of warranty do you offer?</b> <br/><br/>
We offer a one year limited international warranty against manufacturing
defects for the main unit, the Nano USB
Dongle and rubber back-flaps.</p>
<p>We offer a 6 month limited
international warranty against manufacturing defects for the inbuilt battery
and a 1-month exchange warranty for the charging cable.<span>  </span></p>
<p>In all warranty cases, you will need to
pay for shipping to the nearest service center. <br/><br/>
Service center partners who provide repair or exchange services will be based
in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong. <br/><br/><br/><b>How long does the battery last?</b> <br/><br/>
The End-of-Life span of the Li-ion battery will occur in approximately three
years. <br/><br/>
On a daily basis the device works for approximately 15 continuous hours without
needing to recharge, depending on your usage and charging scenario. <br/><br/>
Battery re-charge time from empty to full will take approximately 2 hours. <br/><br/><br/><b>Can I replace the battery myself?</b> <br/><br/>
We advice against replacing the battery yourself. The custom manufactured Li-on
battery is not commercially available and is encased in the ring. <br/><br/>
Once the battery is worn down, you can send us your ThumbTrack™ and we’ll
replace the battery for a small fee. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ an HID Device?</b> <br/><br/>
Yes, ThumbTrack™ and the RF receiver are HID compliant. <br/><br/><br/><b>Do I have to install the provided software to make ThumbTrack™ work?</b> <br/><br/>
No, the software only adds extended features. As soon as you plug in the tiny
wireless USB receiver / dongle into your Windows, Linux PC or Mac -  your
ThumbTrack™ is instantly functional. <br/><br/><br/><b>Which devices and Operating Systems will ThumbTrack™ work on?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ devices and software is compatible with OSX 10.6.8 and upwards as
well as Windows XP, Win 7, Win 8 upwards and Linux. <br/></p><p><span><br/><b>Does ThumbTrack™ work on Android and iOS?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ is not supported on Android and iOS. <br/><br/><br/><b>Is ThumbTrack™ based on Bluetooth Technology? </b><br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ operates on a 2.4 GHz Radio Frequency similar to Bluetooth and runs
a custom-written protocol for communication between the wireless USB
dongle/receiver and ThumbTrack™. <br/><br/>
We have opted for this alternative hardware and software solution because: <br/><br/>
- Our protocol is more device specific than the general Bluetooth protocol <br/>
- It provides superior battery life<br/>
- It provides better connectivity (less disconnect issues and no pairing
issues)<br/>
- It allows us to offer ThumbTrack™ at a more affordable rate to you as we
won't need to license Bluetooth technology<br/><br/>
For the same reasons, established computer peripheral manufacturers such as
Microsoft and Logitech use their own proprietary 2.4 GHz protocols instead of
Bluetooth, for most of their computer mice. <br/><br/><br/><b>Who can order?</b> <br/><br/>
ThumbTrack™ is available worldwide to all countries excluding residents of
countries that fall under US embargo and residents of Belize due to local laws.
<br/><br/><br/><b>Can I get multiple perks?</b> <br/><br/>
Sure, you may choose as many perks as you like. <br/><br/>
If you would like to make a bulk order, please contact us at bulkorder [at]
mindstreaminc [dot] com <br/><br/><br/><b>Where do I enter my preferred color choice?</b></span></p>Once we are ready to ship the perks out, we will send all backers a survey in
which they can choose their preferred color(s) and verify or change their
shipping address. <br/><p>
<br/><br/><b>I do not have a credit card? How else can I purchase a perk?</b> <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, we can only accept credit card purchases at this time. All

<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>Use natural speech to call family or call for help. Just press the button and say who you want to call. It’s easy to talk to anyone in seconds!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>‘Call my daughter’  ‘Call a taxi’  ‘I need help!’</b></p>
<p>Create your own commands based on relationship, name, nickname, or keyword to suit your loved ones preferences. It’s how smarter families connect.</p>
<p><b>More than just voice calls: Coming Soon!</b></p>
<p>We're also working on a range of other voice commands that we'll announce in the coming months. We're experimenting with things like voice notifications, automatic callbacks, or voice to text message and text message to voice. As a Supporter, your feedback will help determine what features make the cut.</p>

<p><b>Your voice in the Cloud</b></p>
<p>Unqiue to CloudPhone, voice translation is done in the cloud. Unlike the most popular voice assistant (by a company that rhymes with snapple), CloudPhone's voice control still works in areas with little or no data coverage. </p>
<p>And if the system doesn't understand who the wearer wants to call, they're instantly connected to another nominated number. </p>
<p><b>Calls Never Go Unanswered</b></p>
<p>The cloud platform ensures your loved one will <b>ALWAYS</b> get through to a human. It's 10x faster than a regular phone, and will keep calling everyone until it reaches a real person (not voicemail!). If no one in your family is available, you can choose it to divert to emergency services (e.g. 911)  or a service provider of your choice.</p>
<p>You have complete control of who it calls and when, via the companion application.</p>
<p><b>Update or change contacts from anywhere</b></p>
<p>All of your contacts and call groups are managed from the companion app, and saved to the cloud. Update details from anywhere, anytime, and the changes take effect instantly.</p>
<p><b>No Voice? No Problem!</b></p>
<p>CloudPhone also works without Voice Control. <b>Press and Hold </b>the button to call 5 contacts and share location simultaneously (Family Call). </p>

<h1>4. AUTOMATIC FALL &amp; MOTION DETECTION</h1>

<p>Bad things happen fast. Timely intervention is critical, but what if Mom can’t reach her phone?</p>
<p>CloudPhone 3G phone is worn all the time, even in the shower. If it detects a fall or a lack of motion, it asks the wearer <b>‘Are you ok?’</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">If they’re not ok, it calls for help and shares its location.</span><br/></p>
<h2><b>Not Just Falls, Lack of Motion too!</b></h2>
<p>Create regular motion alerts based on time of day. For example:</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Mom is always up by 9am, so let me know if she isn’t.</b></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">CloudPhone can constantly monitor activity and alert you to an unusual lack of movement. For example:</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>If dad doesn't move for 10 hours, let me know.</b><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">If an alert is triggered, you'll receive it on your phone and/or via email, and can see the real-time location of the wearer.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/107797/files/20131001213204-_main-_0-02-03-16_.png?1380688324"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><b>It's polite to ask.</b></h3>
<p>CloudPhone is discrete and clever too. Your loved one might have just slept in, or forgot to wear the device. So, before creating a fuss, the device asks <b>'Are you OK?'</b>. If they respond that they’re fine, we do not alert you.</p>

<h1>CLOUD COVER SPECIFICATION:</h1>
<p>The CloudPhone is a fully functional cellular phone. It requires a SIM card (supplied) and 3G or 2G cellular network access to function. </p>
<p><b>There is no lock-in contract.</b> Included with every CloudPhone 3G is a SIM card which gives you access to the Cloud Platform and services we've described.</p>
<p>Each month of coverage (Cloud Cover) includes:</p>
<ul><li>20mins free talk from the device to cell phones and domestic land lines (not international). Includes family and conference calls.  </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>2G/3G data sufficient to deliver location and activity monitoring services</li>
<li>
<b>You can call the device like a regular cell phone</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud Cover also includes automatic fall and lack of motion monitoring, Safe Path monitoring, complete access to the Lifestyle Analytics healthy insights platform, and unlimited installs of the companion application for the whole family. </p>
<p>Additional talk time will be billed at an estimated 0.70c per minute, and you can disable extra time billing in your account. This is subject to change, we're working with carriers and datacentre providers to drive this cost down. Support this campaign, get your friends onboard. With more pre-orders, we can get better supply deals and we'll pass the savings on to you.</p>

<h1><b>OUR TECH JOURNEY</b></h1>
<p>The following is a brief overview of how the CloudPhone has evolved.</p>
<p>It started with an exciting idea, and some sketches way back in 2011 after a family member was injured in a fall. What would it look like? How would it work?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/107884/files/20131001222218-88bdbdae43c0279547ff78529378e5c8_large.png?1380691338"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Version 1</b></p>
<p>Then we started building. This first one worked great, but had some issues. It wasn't super portable. It fit nicely in a suitcase, not so well in your pocket :) It may also permanently entangle household pets or young children. We became fearful of a tangled cat meme involving our CloudPhone. So we kept working…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/107885/files/20131001222350-df8bffbb0fed9dc6931213373154f9cd_large.png?1380691430"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>First Board Production</b></p>
<p>With a little help from our friends, we iterated several electrical designs. First batch had <b>yield issues. </b>The issue was that production didn't yield any working prototypes. Muppets or gremlins poorly placed the GSM module. Busted PCBs are cool for nerd cred &amp; make great conversation pieces… But we kept working.</p>

<p>Happy with the prototype board, Ken designed a 3D model, and then later a shell. For the first time it started looking like a real device. This confirmed our dimension expectations, and allowed us to put it into the hands of real users. 3D printed shells are quite fragile, and definitely not waterproof. But they’re fast, cheap and great for testing.</p>

<p><b>CloudPhone: The Next Generation.</b></p>
<p>We’ve conducted thousands of calls in different network conditions and conducted around 100 000 location tests in all kinds of situations (malls, houses, cars, buses, trains, office towers). We’re confident that our platform is robust and stable, even as a prototype.</p>
<p>Our crowdfunding campaign is to support delivery of the commercial version. The following are computer rendered drawings of the device we are currently developing. These are proportionally correct drawings, based on the next design iteration. We’ve included these to give you an understanding of where the design is going.</p>

<p>The major costs come from more hardware design iterations (Beta, Pre-Production, and Production) and then government certification. We also need to finalize housing design. The prototype shown in the videos is using a 3D printed shell, the commercial version will be smaller, water and impact resistant. </p>
<p>Then we need to create tooling for mass production of the plastics, create test jigs for quality checking the units, secure bulk lots of components, and conduct a test production run. All of this costs many thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>During this time we’re also paying tens of thousands in fees associated with government certification and emissions testing (FCC, PTCRB, SAR, etc.). See Risks below for deeper explanation.</p>
<p>Lots of hoops to jump through, but we believe this is a life changing device and a journey worth taking!</p>

<br/><p></p>
<h1>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We've worked hard for 2 years to de-risk this project. We've built a great team with exceptional experience, and we've worked together for a long time. It’s taken 7000+ man hours and many thousands of dollars to get this far.</p>
<p>In various roles, our team has built numerous software systems and cellular devices in the past (stalk us on Linkedin!). We understand how to manage scope, how to keep projects under control, and how to provide meaningful updates and advice to you, our stakeholders. We are all technology professionals, with years of experience.</p>
<p>We're committed to keeping you informed every step of the way. Below we've outlined the key risks in delivering the CloudPhone 3G on time to your door. This is provided to give you insight into where we see the challenges ahead.</p>
<p><b>Ship Date: </b><br/>We have selected high availability components and have kept the hardware spec. simple. We aren’t reinventing wheels or doing anything a polite engineer would term ‘technically adventurous’,</p>
<p><b>Product Changes: </b><br/>We have a very high level of confidence in delivering the CloudPhone as described. We’re confident because we’ve already built it a few times, and have been testing the live platform for 12 months. We have a few things we want to add (if schedule permits) and we’ll be asking our backers what extra functions they’d like most as we progress through the project. Keep an eye on the stretch goals, there's some fun stuff coming that we'll add if budget permits!</p>
<p><b>Commercialization of the prototype: </b><br/>We need a few more revisions of the electrical design. Based on the testing we've done, we want to add things like haptic (vibration) and voice feedback that will make the user experience truly amazing. We plan our design work thoroughly and keep things simple. So far, things have been very smooth, but gremlins can get in despite our best efforts. Gremlins cause budgets to bleed and timelines to creep.</p>
<p><b>Supplier / Component Difficulty: </b><br/>There is always a risk that a supplier will let us down or that there is a spontaneous global shortage of a much needed widget. We’ve avoided custom made components, and are using widely available parts that can be readily switched to a different equivalent brand wherever possible to lower this risk. If we encounter a component shortage, delivery could be delayed if we cannot find a viable alternative quickly.</p>
<p><b>Certification and Compliance: </b><br/>Turnaround times on some certifications can be 10+ weeks. We’ve factored this into our schedule, but if we fail to comply on first attempt, we’ll have to make changes and re-submit. Yep, ouch. Fortunately, we have our own test facilities and our component supplier is offering us free ‘pre-compliance’ testing. This means that when it comes time to submit to Uncle Sam, we’ll be very confident of getting over the line the first time. The major compliance regimes we are pursuing are PTCRB, FCC, SAR, CE, and A-Tick. Your CloudPhone will be fully compliant with government regulations and safe to use.</p>
<p>And as we said before, you'll be kept in the loop the whole time. Good or bad, you'll know what we're up to.</p>
<p><b>Thank you for your support!</b></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>======  FAQS: 
======</b></p>
<p>CLOUD COVER,
ACTIVATION, &amp; YOUR ACCOUNT</p>
<p><b>What is Cloud Cover
&amp; what’s included?</b></p>
<p>Cloud Cover is the service plan associated with your
CloudPhone 3G. Each month, you receive 20 minutes of calls from the CloudPhone
and 2G/3G data access for streaming activity and location data from the device.
Calls to local and cellular numbers are supported, International dialling is
barred at this time (but may be available under a future plan). </p>
<p>It also includes automatic fall and lack of motion
monitoring, Safe Path monitoring, complete access to the Lifestyle Analytics
healthy insights platform, and unlimited installs of the companion application
for the whole family.</p>
<p><b>Does CloudPhone 3G
work with no Cell coverage?</b></p>
<p>No, CloudPhone requires 2G, 3G, or 3.5G network coverage.
The good news is that we’re using a high sensitivity antenna, and it will
generally work even with weak network coverage.</p>
<p><b>What happens when
Cloud Cover expires?</b></p>
<p>Think of CloudPhone as a very specialized cell phone. Cloud
Cover is like the service plan you have with your normal cell. If your service
expires, your device stops working. You can setup automatic renewals and
alerts, and you can choose casual or contract payment arrangements after your
initial Cloud Cover expires. </p>
<p>For our *Supporters Only*, you will be able to purchase
future access for $20 month without any lock in contract (this will not be
available to the general public). It’s just $0.66c a day to know a family
member safe and well. I would pay that in a second to save my aunt the trauma
she experienced.</p>
<p><b>How will I Activate
the service?</b></p>
<p>You’ll receive the CloudPhone 3G in the mail. No assembly or
configuration of the device is required. Just press the button to turn it on. It
will need to be charged at for at least 24 hours prior to use.</p>
<p>When you receive it, we’ll give instructions to login to our
website and activate the service. You’ll be prompted to supply or import the
relevant information. Once you click “activate”, the CloudPhone is active and
working. <b>You do not need to be in
physical possession of the device to activate, so you can buy it for your
grandparents, and set it up from home.</b></p>
<p>You need to have either a Credit Card or an approved PayPal
account to activate your account.</p>
<p><b>SIM Activation</b></p>
<p>The device needs an active SIM card. We’ll supply you with
the SIM, but its activation and use are subject to the laws in your
jurisdiction/country. </p>
<p><b>Do I need to have a
Smartphone for CloudPhone to Work?</b></p>
<p>Nope! CloudPhone is not Bluetooth dongle- <b>it’s a standalone cellular phone</b>,
designed to be awesome for the elderly and young kids.</p>
<p><b>Does it use a SIM
Card?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Each CloudPhone is a fully functioning cellular phone.
We supply you with the SIM card, each device is configured to work specifically
with our Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>CloudPhone 3G is only available in USA, UK, and Australia.
SIM cards will be supplied for these regions.</p>
<p><b>Can I bring my own
SIM?</b></p>
<p>No, not at this stage. Our system is configured to work
specifically with the SIM card we supply you. BYO is something we are
considering, but have no immediate plans to do it. Allowing people to use
whatever SIM card complicates the system quite a lot, and our mantra is keep it
simple. </p>
<p><b>Can I use the SIM
card for something else?</b></p>
<p>No. The SIM we provide you works specifically with our
platform. It’s barred from calling anything but our system, and placing it in
another device will be a breach of our terms of service (which we’ll provide to
you prior to activation).</p>
<p><b>How do I update
contact or other information?</b></p>
<p>Contact numbers and other personal information can be
updated via the companion smartphone application or via our website.

</p>
<p>CLOUD PLATFORM</p>
<p><b>What happens if I
miss a call</b>?</p>
<p>You set your own rules. If you miss the call, you can set
the system to refer the call to others in your family, or nominate a call
answering service (like 911 or a managed service provider). The CloudPhone
companion application will show you who answered so you’re not left in the
dark.</p>
<p><b>Why does it use the
cloud, why not do it on the device?</b></p>
<p>Transforming calls and data in the cloud lets us do some
very cool and helpful things. </p>
<p>Our voice control doesn’t need a data connection, and you
can create your own custom voice profiles. </p>
<p>Pushing calls to the cloud means a call from CloudPhone is
never missed. It’s also 5-10x faster than normal phone dialling because we
contact many people simultaneously (based on your preferences). It detects
humans too, we won’t hand your loved one to voice mail.</p>
<p>The CloudPhone design also keeps the device simple and
stable, extends battery life (services are turned on and off as needed). It
lets you control any aspect of your loved one’s service remotely via your
smartphone. Changes take effect instantly.</p>
<p><b>Call handling in the
cloud?</b></p>
<p>Call handling from the device is done in real time via our
cloud platform. We make sure a call from a CloudPhone is ALWAYS connected to a
human. If you miss a call, our system keeps trying different numbers (you’ve
nominated) until someone else answers. We recommend you set a 911 / 999 / 000
or a managed service provider as your contact of last resort. </p>
<p>Cloud based call handling also means you can do cool stuff
like ‘swipe to add’ people to existing calls (up to 5), and create rules based
on time and location, like ‘between 1am and 5am, call 911 not me!’</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">VOICE
CONTROL:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I DISABLE Voice
Control?</b></p>
<p>The device works without Voice Control. If you disable it,
the device will always create a family conference call and share its location
whenever the button is pressed. </p>
<p>This is much simpler, but a little less flexible. Great for
Grandma if she doesn’t like fussing around, and just wants to use it to talk to
you and live safely.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What speech
recognition are you using?</b></p>
<p>We’re using a very prominent provider. We can’t say more. It
works great.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Is it listening to me
like the Motorola Moto X?</b></p>
<p>No, you need to press the button first. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What controls are
available?</b></p>
<p>At launch, you will be able to call someone by referring to
their name (first and/or surname), their relationship to you (e.g. son/daughter),
or by a special title or key word (e.g. doctor). </p>
<p>You can also create a conference call with voice. You create
a call group (e.g. My Family) and nominated the members. Then when the user
says ‘call my family’, a call to the whole family is created and whoever is
available will join the conversation. </p>
<p>This is also a useful method of creating a ‘panic word’ like
‘help’. If the wearer presses it and says ‘I need help’ everyone is connected
in an instant conference and the location of the wearer is shared with the
family.</p>
<p>In future, we expect to have a range of commands available
for more advanced users like safety call backs, and voice to text messages.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What happens if it
doesn’t understand the command?</b></p>
<p>You control how it works. If it doesn’t understand, it will tell
the wearer and suggest most likely best fit. You can set it to ask the wearer
to repeat their instruction, or have it automatically call you or another
nominated number.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Does it recognize
strong accents?</b></p>
<p>It’s hard to say, try out voice control on your smartphone.
Some accents are fine, others not so much. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">LIFESTYLE
ANALYTICS:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What is Lifestyle
Analytics?</b></p>
<p>It’s the feature we’re most excited about! It measures a
range of activity information to help you and your loved one better understand
their health. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">It lets you and her see the impact of changes in medication, care, or other life events.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Want to set fitness plan to help her recover
from an injury? </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Has she been getting out enough lately? </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">CloudPhone gives you and her the tools she needs to live better.</span><br/></p>
<p>Plus, if you save medication and other information in the
application we’ll send you regular reminders to help keep it up to date.</p>
<p>The tools you see in the video are just the start. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I disable Lifestyle
Analytics?</b></p>
<p>You can disable it in the companion application. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">FALL AND
MOTION DETECTION:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How does it monitor
falls?</b></p>
<p>CloudPhone uses a multi-axis accelerometer to detect falls
and motion.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I set Lack of
Motion Alarms?</b></p>
<p>Yes. You can set it based on time of day e.g. mom is always
up by 9am, so let me know if she isn’t. </p>
<p>Or base it on periods of inactivity. E.g. if dad hasn’t moved
for 10 hours, let me know.</p>
<p>Your loved one might just have slept in, or forgot to wear
the device. So, before creating a fuss, the device asks the user if they’re OK.
If they respond that they’re fine, we do not alert you.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What happens if
they’re not ok or the device doesn’t understand them? </b></p>
<p>We create a family call (an instant conference call), or
call any number or numbers you nominate, and share the location of the wearer.
You’ll be talking to the wearer and seeing them on the map in just a few
moments.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do they have to press
a button after a fall?</b></p>
<p>No, the device will call automatically if they’re not OK.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I turn off fall
and motion detection?</b></p>
<p>Yes, via the companion application.</p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">SAFE PATH &amp;
GPS:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I create my own
Safe Paths?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Via the companion application, you’ll just tap out the
path, set when and how you want it monitored, and tap save. Changes are
instant.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What is Safe Path
used for?</b></p>
<p>It’s been designed
to take the hassle out of regular travel. It works great to and from school.
Other regular events like weekly shopping or travel for medical care, regular
social outings or even regular exercise or circuits.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Does it work indoors?</b></p>
<p>Yes. It will work whever you have cell coverage and
there are WiFi hotspots around (you don’t need to connect to the hotspot, they
just have to be around). This means it works very well in urban environments
like shopping malls.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I monitor more
than 1 device?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you can have as many as you like. Each can have it’s
own Safe Paths. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> <b></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">INTERNATIONAL
SUPPORTERS</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">I’m not from the US, UK, or Australia. Why won’t it work in
my country?</p>
<p>We’ve imposed this limitation to make the launch more
manageable. We need to deploy and support cloud software in each region and we
need to comply with local government regulations. </p>
<p>As a startup, 3 countries is extremely ambitious, we can’t
stretch any further without seriously risking the quality of the service we
provide to you. To tell us to hurry up and come to your country, pledge $5 and
we’ll make sure you’re first to know. If we get enough pledges from a new
region, we’ll add it as a stretch goal.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">PRIVACY,
LOCATION SHARING AND YOUR DATA </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Does the device show
when it’s sharing location?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The blue LED pulses constantly when it’s sharing
location. This cannot be disabled.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I turn off
Location Sharing?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The account holder can partially or totally disable
location sharing. For example, you may set the CloudPhone to only share its
location during an emergency event, or you might elect to have it share its
location periodically throughout the day. Or you might disable location
sharing entirely. It’s up to you.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Is my information
encrypted?</b></p>
<p>We’re using 512bit encryption to secure your information. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do I have to provide
medical or other sensitive information?</b></p>
<p>No. The service works just fine without it. </p>
<p>We’ve made it possible to securely save this information
because in our own families, we have real problems remembering and keeping
track of our grandparent’s medications, allergies, ailments and the like. </p>
<p>In an emergency, the companion application lets you share it
instantly and securely with paramedics or other first responders. The link it
generates automatically expires after 3 hours, so you don’t have to share login
information or worry about people snooping later.</p>
<p>The only information required to use the service is names,
email addresses, and contact numbers of the people you want to have the
CloudPhone to call or notify. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I turn off
location tracking?</b></p>
<p>Yes. This is managed within the companion app. The device
pulses blue when it is reporting it’s location.</p>
<p>We know protecting the privacy of your information is
critical. Here is an outline of how we’re managing it. A complete disclosure
statement will be provided prior to you activating your service. It will be in
plain English, and comply completely with the laws in your country.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What is Personal
Information?</b></p>
<p>This is all the information you provide us that personally
describes you. Phone numbers, names, date of birth etc. Anything that can be
used to work out who you are. We use this information to deliver and manage the
service. We will not sell it to third parties, or use it for any other reason
than to provide you with great service. You can delete it at anytime. This is
just a summary of our privacy policy, we take it very seriously. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Where will it be stored?</b></p>
<p>Your personal data will be kept
in your country of origin. If you register from the US, your data will remain
in the US, likewise if you’re an Aussie, it stays down-under. Each region has
its own instance of our software, hosted in local datacentres. Personal data
will not be shared or moved between regions. 
</p>
<p>We use a reputable US based email
provider to manage external communications, such as automated ‘alert’
notifications. Name, email address and your notification preferences will be
physically stored in datacentres in the US.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What will we do with it?</b></p>
<p>We use it to deliver a
personalised service to you and your family. Such as who’s calling, what their
contact details are, and whether to display options relevant to an older person
or a child. You decide when and to whom your information is shared, the
application gives you complete control. That’s it, nothing tricky. As mentioned
before, we will not sell your personal information to third parties. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can you delete it?</b></p>
<p>Yes. In the unlikely event that
you want to your account deleted, just let us know you want it gone and we’ll
permanently delete your information. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Location Information</b></p>
<p>Our device and software may collect location information
from GPS, Cell tower, and WiFi hotspots. This can be disabled and managed via
your account preferences. We only ever collect location information to support
your use of the service, we do not collect it without your explicit permission.
The device DOES NOT constantly share its’ location with you. It shares only
when you set it to do so. The following describes how we handle your location
information.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Where does it live?</b></p>
<p>We store identifiable location
information reported by the device in your country of origin. It’s kept for a
maximum of 72hrs. We use a highly reputable US based 3<sup>rd</sup> party
service to assist in working out where the device is. They do not retain the
information, they process it and send it back to us.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What will we do with it?</b></p>
<p>Location information is securely
shared with your family via our software for a number of reasons that you will
configure.</p>
<p>As part of an emergency alert we
share the real-time location of the device for 3 hours. After this time,
tracking automatically stops and current and historical location is hidden. </p>
<p>Our Safe Path route monitoring
collects location info during the periods you set it to be active. As above,
during the active period you can see the location of the device via your
account. 3 hours after the end of this tracking period, the historical location
information is hidden. </p>
<p>As an account holder, you may
also poll the device remotely. This information is handled in the same way as
an emergency alert- collected for 3 hours then stopped unless polled again.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>IMPORTANT: COPPA
Regulation (USA only)</b></p>
<p>If you are buying a CloudPhone for use by a child aged 13 or
under located in the US, we need your explicit consent to collect personal and
location information about the child. This consent will be captured when you
activate your device. Additionally, you must have a valid credit card which we
will charge for $1.00 at the time of activation, to prove that you are an adult
capable of providing consent.  These
actions are necessary to comply with US law. </p>

*** UPDATE *** UPDATE ***


Introducing the CloudPhone 3G. 



The next generation of wearable smartphones for healthier, safer, families has arrived.

Designed to keep seniors & children connected, and deliver powerful insights into your family's health.







To our international friends, we're sorry but initially CloudPhone will only work in the above regions. We're 'coming soon' everywhere else. Become a Supporter to let us know we should come to your country!


 
1. VOICE CONTROLLED DIALING



Use natural speech to call family or call for help. Just press the button and say who you want to call. It’s easy to talk to anyone in seconds!
‘Call my daughter’  ‘Call a taxi’  ‘I need help!’
Create your own commands based on relationship, name, nickname, or keyword to suit your loved ones preferences. It’s how smarter families connect.
More than just voice calls: Coming Soon!
We're also working on a range of other voice commands that we'll announce in the coming months. We're experimenting with things like voice notifications, automatic callbacks, or voice to text message and text message to voice. As a Supporter, your feedback will help determine what features make the cut.

Your voice in the Cloud
Unqiue to CloudPhone, voice translation is done in the cloud. Unlike the most popular voice assistant (by a company that rhymes with snapple), CloudPhone's voice control still works in areas with little or no data coverage. 
And if the system doesn't understand who the wearer wants to call, they're instantly connected to another nominated number. 
Calls Never Go Unanswered
The cloud platform ensures your loved one will ALWAYS get through to a human. It's 10x faster than a regular phone, and will keep calling everyone until it reaches a real person (not voicemail!). If no one in your family is available, you can choose it to divert to emergency services (e.g. 911)  or a service provider of your choice.
You have complete control of who it calls and when, via the companion application.
Update or change contacts from anywhere
All of your contacts and call groups are managed from the companion app, and saved to the cloud. Update details from anywhere, anytime, and the changes take effect instantly.
No Voice? No Problem!
CloudPhone also works without Voice Control. Press and Hold the button to call 5 contacts and share location simultaneously (Family Call). 
Checkout the VOICE CONTROL FAQ at the bottom of this page for details. 

2. LIFESTYLE ANALYTICS

Discover illness before disaster strikes! CloudPhone 3G monitors your loved ones physical activity and provides powerful insight into their health.
With Lifestyle Analytics, you'll have never before seen insight into the impact of changes in care, medication, or behavior on your loved ones health.
Powerful information, easy to use dashboard
A multi-axis accelerometer tracks physical activity throughout the day. This information is combined with a range of information including travel, time outdoors and health information, and displayed on an easy to use dashboard on your phone or tablet.




With Lifestyle Analytics, you'll see the smallest changes in activity and know to ask the right questions.
""You haven't been getting out much lately mom. Are you feeling ok?""
""Dad, how's your new medication going?""
Communicate better. Prevent small health problems from growing into big ones.
 
Checkout the LIFESTYLE ANALYTICS FAQ at the bottom of this page for details. 

3. Safe Path - Transit Monitoring



Safe path automatically monitors regular transit activity – like going to and from school, or other regular appointments. You set the route and schedule, CloudPhone lets you know if things go wrong.
Geolocation works indoors (WiFi) and outdoors (WiFi/GPS). CloudPhone can find your loved one even in large shopping centers or other dense urban environments where traditional GPS fails.



You can’t be everywhere all the time, but CloudPhone can. Features include:



Automatic Check-in Notification: “Sally has left School” or “Dad has arrived home” 


Running Late Notification: “Sally is late. Expected Home @8:30am” 


Unapproved Path: “Sally has left the approved Path”


Notifications are sent to your phone via SMS or via email. A secure link shows you where your loved one is in real time, even indoors. 

Checkout the SAFE PATH FAQ at the bottom of this page for details. 

4. AUTOMATIC FALL & MOTION DETECTION

Bad things happen fast. Timely intervention is critical, but what if Mom can’t reach her phone?
CloudPhone 3G phone is worn all the time, even in the shower. If it detects a fall or a lack of motion, it asks the wearer ‘Are you ok?’
If they’re not ok, it calls for help and shares its location.
Not Just Falls, Lack of Motion too!
Create regular motion alerts based on time of day. For example:

Mom is always up by 9am, so let me know if she isn’t.
CloudPhone can constantly monitor activity and alert you to an unusual lack of movement. For example:
If dad doesn't move for 10 hours, let me know.
If an alert is triggered, you'll receive it on your phone and/or via email, and can see the real-time location of the wearer.

It's polite to ask.
CloudPhone is discrete and clever too. Your loved one might have just slept in, or forgot to wear the device. So, before creating a fuss, the device asks 'Are you OK?'. If they respond that they’re fine, we do not alert you.

Checkout the FALL & MOTION FAQ at the bottom of this page for details.

5. FAMILY CALLS

Now everyone can talk to grandma... at the same time!
CloudPhone 3G can create an instant conference call with your whole family. It’s as easy as pressing a button.
Use Family Calls to talk and share as a family, or to coordinate a response in an emergency.There is no faster way to call for help.
Create your own 'panic words' that trigger instant emergency calls and share the wearer's location.
Talk Grandma through a crisis
If you're helping a family member with medical emergency, just 'swipe' to add 911 or emergency services. They're added to the conference call with just one touch, so you can stay on the line the whole time.

Checkout the FALL & MOTION FAQ at the bottom of this page for details.

6. EASY TO OWN




CloudPhone lives in a charge dock when it's not being used.
It lasts for 10 days+ of normal operation without charge, so it's no problem if the wearer forgets to charge it occasionally. If the battery is low, you will receive a warning notification on your smartphone via the companion app.
No configuration, works right out of the box
It's the perfect gift for distant relatives, as the device needs no configuration. All your loved one needs to do is take it out of the box and put it on. 
You can manage the service from anywhere in the world! 




CARE PACKAGES FOR SUPPORTERS

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
We’re developing a high quality product, using fully licensed and certified components. The following section has the general technical parameters of the CloudPhone 3G hardware, software, and cloud platform.


NOTE ON LTE / 4G: We aren't supporting 4G / LTE at this stage. Coverage is terrible, it's more expensive, battery life is shorter, and the extra bandwidth is not needed. 















CLOUD COVER SPECIFICATION:
The CloudPhone is a fully functional cellular phone. It requires a SIM card (supplied) and 3G or 2G cellular network access to function. 
There is no lock-in contract. Included with every CloudPhone 3G is a SIM card which gives you access to the Cloud Platform and services we've described.
Each month of coverage (Cloud Cover) includes:
20mins free talk from the device to cell phones and domestic land lines (not international). Includes family and conference calls.  

2G/3G data sufficient to deliver location and activity monitoring services

You can call the device like a regular cell phone.

Cloud Cover also includes automatic fall and lack of motion monitoring, Safe Path monitoring, complete access to the Lifestyle Analytics healthy insights platform, and unlimited installs of the companion application for the whole family. 
Additional talk time will be billed at an estimated 0.70c per minute, and you can disable extra time billing in your account. This is subject to change, we're working with carriers and datacentre providers to drive this cost down. Support this campaign, get your friends onboard. With more pre-orders, we can get better supply deals and we'll pass the savings on to you.
See the Cloud Cover FAQs for more information.



OUR TECH JOURNEY
The following is a brief overview of how the CloudPhone has evolved.
It started with an exciting idea, and some sketches way back in 2011 after a family member was injured in a fall. What would it look like? How would it work?

Version 1
Then we started building. This first one worked great, but had some issues. It wasn't super portable. It fit nicely in a suitcase, not so well in your pocket :) It may also permanently entangle household pets or young children. We became fearful of a tangled cat meme involving our CloudPhone. So we kept working…

First Board Production
With a little help from our friends, we iterated several electrical designs. First batch had yield issues. The issue was that production didn't yield any working prototypes. Muppets or gremlins poorly placed the GSM module. Busted PCBs are cool for nerd cred & make great conversation pieces… But we kept working.
The ugly protuberance is the programming header, this is only present on the prototypes. It makes Ken’s life a little easier, uploading new firmware, testing new components, and running diagnostics.


Happy with the prototype board, Ken designed a 3D model, and then later a shell. For the first time it started looking like a real device. This confirmed our dimension expectations, and allowed us to put it into the hands of real users. 3D printed shells are quite fragile, and definitely not waterproof. But they’re fast, cheap and great for testing.

CloudPhone: The Next Generation.
We’ve conducted thousands of calls in different network conditions and conducted around 100 000 location tests in all kinds of situations (malls, houses, cars, buses, trains, office towers). We’re confident that our platform is robust and stable, even as a prototype.
Our crowdfunding campaign is to support delivery of the commercial version. The following are computer rendered drawings of the device we are currently developing. These are proportionally correct drawings, based on the next design iteration. We’ve included these to give you an understanding of where the design is going.
If you've got some great ideas to share, support the project and let us know. Your input can make real changes.



What are we doing with your money?
The ollo mobile team aren’t eating your money. We are self-sustaining organisms that thrive on hopes, dreams, and cloud puns! We tried to think of more cloud jokes but we mist.
But 'cirrus-iously' (cloud pun), you’re not funding our hobby. You’re not paying our rent. 100% of your contribution is going towards the development of the CloudPhone 3G. 
We’re doing this because we want to work with you to fix a very real, very important problem. Your support is great, your feedback is awesome.
We all believe very passionately that this project will change lives. Our long suffering wives, partners, and friends, support our dream, and are very graciously keeping the lights on at home and food on the table. We couldn’t have gotten this far without their ongoing support over the past 2 years.

Can you really build the CloudPhone for $50K? (The short answer)
Short answer is ‘no’, but the longer answer is ‘yes’. Read on.
It takes millions of dollars to launch a cutting edge piece of tech like CloudPhone with the build quality you expect and deserve. 
Your pledge helps us secure the funding needed to deliver your CloudPhone. 
Why we NEED your support (The longer answer)
We need awesome early adopters. 
Those of you that think their family deserves the best possible care. 
YOU'RE AWESOME.
Those of you in the vanguard of cool tech, the mavericks of innovation. 
YOU'RE AWESOME.
Those of you that love the newest and the greatest, and shun Best Buy... except if the deal is really sweet...
YOU'RE AWESOME.

Those of you that have the gumption to click the pledge button...
YOU'RE AWESOME.
You, our early adopters are proof that the CloudPhone 3G is useful and cool. Your engagement proves to our investors that this is an investment worth making. They don't want us to tell them it's awesome, they want you to hear it from you!
For sharing our dream and joining us on this journey, you’ll have the coolest piece of family tech first, and at cost price. 
You'll also know that you helped create something special that would not have existed without you.
Your support is absolutely critical. With you behind us, we’ve got the other stuff covered. 
Together, we’ll launch a system that might save the life of someone you love.  
TOGETHER, WE'RE AWESOME.



Project Schedule:



The major costs come from more hardware design iterations (Beta, Pre-Production, and Production) and then government certification. We also need to finalize housing design. The prototype shown in the videos is using a 3D printed shell, the commercial version will be smaller, water and impact resistant. 
Then we need to create tooling for mass production of the plastics, create test jigs for quality checking the units, secure bulk lots of components, and conduct a test production run. All of this costs many thousands of dollars.
During this time we’re also paying tens of thousands in fees associated with government certification and emissions testing (FCC, PTCRB, SAR, etc.). See Risks below for deeper explanation.
Lots of hoops to jump through, but we believe this is a life changing device and a journey worth taking!




RISKS AND CHALLENGES


We've worked hard for 2 years to de-risk this project. We've built a great team with exceptional experience, and we've worked together for a long time. It’s taken 7000+ man hours and many thousands of dollars to get this far.
In various roles, our team has built numerous software systems and cellular devices in the past (stalk us on Linkedin!). We understand how to manage scope, how to keep projects under control, and how to provide meaningful updates and advice to you, our stakeholders. We are all technology professionals, with years of experience.
We're committed to keeping you informed every step of the way. Below we've outlined the key risks in delivering the CloudPhone 3G on time to your door. This is provided to give you insight into where we see the challenges ahead.
Ship Date: We have selected high availability components and have kept the hardware spec. simple. We aren’t reinventing wheels or doing anything a polite engineer would term ‘technically adventurous’,
Product Changes: We have a very high level of confidence in delivering the CloudPhone as described. We’re confident because we’ve already built it a few times, and have been testing the live platform for 12 months. We have a few things we want to add (if schedule permits) and we’ll be asking our backers what extra functions they’d like most as we progress through the project. Keep an eye on the stretch goals, there's some fun stuff coming that we'll add if budget permits!
Commercialization of the prototype: We need a few more revisions of the electrical design. Based on the testing we've done, we want to add things like haptic (vibration) and voice feedback that will make the user experience truly amazing. We plan our design work thoroughly and keep things simple. So far, things have been very smooth, but gremlins can get in despite our best efforts. Gremlins cause budgets to bleed and timelines to creep.
Supplier / Component Difficulty: There is always a risk that a supplier will let us down or that there is a spontaneous global shortage of a much needed widget. We’ve avoided custom made components, and are using widely available parts that can be readily switched to a different equivalent brand wherever possible to lower this risk. If we encounter a component shortage, delivery could be delayed if we cannot find a viable alternative quickly.
Certification and Compliance: Turnaround times on some certifications can be 10+ weeks. We’ve factored this into our schedule, but if we fail to comply on first attempt, we’ll have to make changes and re-submit. Yep, ouch. Fortunately, we have our own test facilities and our component supplier is offering us free ‘pre-compliance’ testing. This means that when it comes time to submit to Uncle Sam, we’ll be very confident of getting over the line the first time. The major compliance regimes we are pursuing are PTCRB, FCC, SAR, CE, and A-Tick. Your CloudPhone will be fully compliant with government regulations and safe to use.
And as we said before, you'll be kept in the loop the whole time. Good or bad, you'll know what we're up to.
Thank you for your support!

======  FAQS: 
======
CLOUD COVER,
ACTIVATION, & YOUR ACCOUNT
What is Cloud Cover
& what’s included?
Cloud Cover is the service plan associated with your
CloudPhone 3G. Each month, you receive 20 minutes of calls from the CloudPhone
and 2G/3G data access for streaming activity and location data from the device.
Calls to local and cellular numbers are supported, International dialling is
barred at this time (but may be available under a future plan). 
It also includes automatic fall and lack of motion
monitoring, Safe Path monitoring, complete access to the Lifestyle Analytics
healthy insights platform, and unlimited installs of the companion application
for the whole family.
Does CloudPhone 3G
work with no Cell coverage?
No, CloudPhone requires 2G, 3G, or 3.5G network coverage.
The good news is that we’re using a high sensitivity antenna, and it will
generally work even with weak network coverage.
What happens when
Cloud Cover expires?
Think of CloudPhone as a very specialized cell phone. Cloud
Cover is like the service plan you have with your normal cell. If your service
expires, your device stops working. You can setup automatic renewals and
alerts, and you can choose casual or contract payment arrangements after your
initial Cloud Cover expires. 
For our *Supporters Only*, you will be able to purchase
future access for $20 month without any lock in contract (this will not be
available to the general public). It’s just $0.66c a day to know a family
member safe and well. I would pay that in a second to save my aunt the trauma
she experienced.
How will I Activate
the service?
You’ll receive the CloudPhone 3G in the mail. No assembly or
configuration of the device is required. Just press the button to turn it on. It
will need to be charged at for at least 24 hours prior to use.
When you receive it, we’ll give instructions to login to our
website and activate the service. You’ll be prompted to supply or import the
relevant information. Once you click “activate”, the CloudPhone is active and
working. You do not need to be in
physical possession of the device to activate, so you can buy it for your
grandparents, and set it up from home.
You need to have either a Credit Card or an approved PayPal
account to activate your account.
SIM Activation
The device needs an active SIM card. We’ll supply you with
the SIM, but its activation and use are subject to the laws in your
jurisdiction/country. 
Do I need to have a
Smartphone for CloudPhone to Work?
Nope! CloudPhone is not Bluetooth dongle- it’s a standalone cellular phone,
designed to be awesome for the elderly and young kids.
Does it use a SIM
Card?
Yes. Each CloudPhone is a fully functioning cellular phone.
We supply you with the SIM card, each device is configured to work specifically
with our Cloud Platform.
CloudPhone 3G is only available in USA, UK, and Australia.
SIM cards will be supplied for these regions.
Can I bring my own
SIM?
No, not at this stage. Our system is configured to work
specifically with the SIM card we supply you. BYO is something we are
considering, but have no immediate plans to do it. Allowing people to use
whatever SIM card complicates the system quite a lot, and our mantra is keep it
simple. 
Can I use the SIM
card for something else?
No. The SIM we provide you works specifically with our
platform. It’s barred from calling anything but our system, and placing it in
another device will be a breach of our terms of service (which we’ll provide to
you prior to activation).
How do I update
contact or other information?
Contact numbers and other personal information can be
updated via the companion smartphone application or via our website.


CLOUD PLATFORM
What happens if I
miss a call?
You set your own rules. If you miss the call, you can set
the system to refer the call to others in your family, or nominate a call
answering service (like 911 or a managed service provider). The CloudPhone
companion application will show you who answered so you’re not left in the
dark.
Why does it use the
cloud, why not do it on the device?
Transforming calls and data in the cloud lets us do some
very cool and helpful things. 
Our voice control doesn’t need a data connection, and you
can create your own custom voice profiles. 
Pushing calls to the cloud means a call from CloudPhone is
never missed. It’s also 5-10x faster than normal phone dialling because we
contact many people simultaneously (based on your preferences). It detects
humans too, we won’t hand your loved one to voice mail.
The CloudPhone design also keeps the device simple and
stable, extends battery life (services are turned on and off as needed). It
lets you control any aspect of your loved one’s service remotely via your
smartphone. Changes take effect instantly.
Call handling in the
cloud?
Call handling from the device is done in real time via our
cloud platform. We make sure a call from a CloudPhone is ALWAYS connected to a
human. If you miss a call, our system keeps trying different numbers (you’ve
nominated) until someone else answers. We recommend you set a 911 / 999 / 000
or a managed service provider as your contact of last resort. 
Cloud based call handling also means you can do cool stuff
like ‘swipe to add’ people to existing calls (up to 5), and create rules based
on time and location, like ‘between 1am and 5am, call 911 not me!’
For information about how we handle your data and what
happens to it, check out the Priv

VOICE
CONTROL:
Can I DISABLE Voice
Control?
The device works without Voice Control. If you disable it,
the device will always create a family conference call and share its location
whenever the button is pressed. 
This is much simpler, but a little less flexible. Great for
Grandma if she doesn’t like fussing around, and just wants to use it to talk to
you and live safely.
What speech
recognition are you using?
We’re using a very prominent provider. We can’t say more. It
works great.
Is it listening to me
like the Motorola Moto X?
No, you need to press the button first. 
What controls are
available?
At launch, you will be able to call someone by referring to
their name (first and/or surname), their relationship to you (e.g. son/daughter),
or by a special title or key word (e.g. doctor). 
You can also create a conference call with voice. You create
a call group (e.g. My Family) and nominated the members. Then when the user
says ‘call my family’, a call to the whole family is created and whoever is
available will join the conversation. 
This is also a useful method of creating a ‘panic word’ like
‘help’. If the wearer presses it and says ‘I need help’ everyone is connected
in an instant conference and the location of the wearer is shared with the
family.
In future, we expect to have a range of commands available
for more advanced users like safety call backs, and voice to text messages.
What happens if it
doesn’t understand the command?
You control how it works. If it doesn’t understand, it will tell
the wearer and suggest most likely best fit. You can set it to ask the wearer
to repeat their instruction, or have it automatically call you or another
nominated number.
Does it recognize
strong accents?
It’s hard to say, try out voice control on your smartphone.
Some accents are fine, others not so much. 

LIFESTYLE
ANALYTICS:
What is Lifestyle
Analytics?
It’s the feature we’re most excited about! It measures a
range of activity information to help you and your loved one better understand
their health. 
It lets you and her see the impact of changes in medication, care, or other life events.
Want to set fitness plan to help her recover
from an injury? 
Has she been getting out enough lately? 
CloudPhone gives you and her the tools she needs to live better.
Plus, if you save medication and other information in the
application we’ll send you regular reminders to help keep it up to date.
The tools you see in the video are just the start. 
Can I disable Lifestyle
Analytics?
You can disable it in the companion application. 
FALL AND
MOTION DETECTION:
How does it monitor
falls?
CloudPhone uses a multi-axis accelerometer to detect falls
and motion.
Can I set Lack of
Motion Alarms?
Yes. You can set it based on time of day e.g. mom is always
up by 9am, so let me know if she isn’t. 
Or base it on periods of inactivity. E.g. if dad hasn’t moved
for 10 hours, let me know.
Your loved one might just have slept in, or forgot to wear
the device. So, before creating a fuss, the device asks the user if they’re OK.
If they respond that they’re fine, we do not alert you.
What happens if
they’re not ok or the device doesn’t understand them? 
We create a family call (an instant conference call), or
call any number or numbers you nominate, and share the location of the wearer.
You’ll be talking to the wearer and seeing them on the map in just a few
moments.
Do they have to press
a button after a fall?
No, the device will call automatically if they’re not OK.
Can I turn off fall
and motion detection?
Yes, via the companion application.


SAFE PATH &
GPS:
Can I create my own
Safe Paths?
Yes. Via the companion application, you’ll just tap out the
path, set when and how you want it monitored, and tap save. Changes are
instant.
What is Safe Path
used for?
It’s been designed
to take the hassle out of regular travel. It works great to and from school.
Other regular events like weekly shopping or travel for medical care, regular
social outings or even regular exercise or circuits.
Does it work indoors?
Yes. It will work whever you have cell coverage and
there are WiFi hotspots around (you don’t need to connect to the hotspot, they
just have to be around). This means it works very well in urban environments
like shopping malls.
Can I monitor more
than 1 device?
Yes, you can have as many as you like. Each can have it’s
own Safe Paths. 
 
INTERNATIONAL
SUPPORTERS
I’m not from the US, UK, or Australia. Why won’t it work in
my country?
We’ve imposed this limitation to make the launch more
manageable. We need to deploy and support cloud software in each region and we
need to comply with local government regulations. 
As a startup, 3 countries is extremely ambitious, we can’t
stretch any further without seriously risking the quality of the service we
provide to you. To tell us to hurry up and come to your country, pledge $5 and
we’ll make sure you’re first to know. If we get enough pledges from a new
region, we’ll add it as a stretch goal.
PRIVACY,
LOCATION SHARING AND YOUR DATA 
Does the device show
when it’s sharing location?
Yes. The blue LED pulses constantly when it’s sharing
location. This cannot be disabled.
Can I turn off
Location Sharing?
Yes. The account holder can partially or totally disable
location sharing. For example, you may set the CloudPhone to only share its
location during an emergency event, or you might elect to have it share its
location periodically throughout the day. Or you might disable location
sharing entirely. It’s up to you.
Is my information
encrypted?
We’re using 512bit encryption to secure your information. 
Do I have to provide
medical or other sensitive information?
No. The service works just fine without it. 
We’ve made it possible to securely save this information
because in our own families, we have real problems remembering and keeping
track of our grandparent’s medications, allergies, ailments and the like. 
In an emergency, the companion application lets you share it
instantly and securely with paramedics or other first responders. The link it
generates automatically expires after 3 hours, so you don’t have to share login
information or worry about people snooping later.
The only information required to use the service is names,
email addresses, and contact numbers of the people you want to have the
CloudPhone to call or notify. 
Can I turn off
location tracking?
Yes. This is managed within the companion app. The device
pulses blue when it is reporting it’s location.
We know protecting the privacy of your information is
critical. Here is an outline of how we’re managing it. A complete disclosure
statement will be provided prior to you activating your service. It will be in
plain English, and comply completely with the laws in your country.
What is Personal
Information?
This is all the information you provide us that personally
describes you. Phone numbers, names, date of birth etc. Anything that can be
used to work out who you are. We use this information to deliver and manage the
service. We will not sell it to third parties, or use it for any other reason
than to provide you with great service. You can delete it at anytime. This is
just a summary of our privacy policy, we take it very seriously. 
Where will it be stored?
Your personal data will be kept
in your country of origin. If you register from the US, your data will remain
in the US, likewise if you’re an Aussie, it stays down-under. Each region has
its own instance of our software, hosted in local datacentres. Personal data
will not be shared or moved between regions. 

We use a reputable US based email
provider to manage external communications, such as automated ‘alert’
notifications. Name, email address and your notification preferences will be
physically stored in datacentres in the US.
What will we do with it?
We use it to deliver a
personalised service to you and your family. Such as who’s calling, what their
contact details are, and whether to display options relevant to an older person
or a child. You decide when and to whom your information is shared, the
application gives you complete control. That’s it, nothing tricky. As mentioned
before, we will not sell your personal information to third parties. 
Can you delete it?
Yes. In the unlikely event that
you want to your account deleted, just let us know you want it gone and we’ll
permanently delete your information. 
Location Information
Our device and software may collect location information
from GPS, Cell tower, and WiFi hotspots. This can be disabled and managed via
your account preferences. We only ever collect location information to support
your use of the service, we do not collect it without your explicit permission.
The device DOES NOT constantly share its’ location with you. It shares only
when you set it to do so. The following describes how we handle your location
information.
Where does it live?
We store identifiable location
information reported by the device in your country of origin. It’s kept for a
maximum of 72hrs. We use a highly reputable US based 3rd party
service to assist in working out where the device is. They do not retain the
information, they process it and send it back to us.
What will we do with it?
Location information is securely
shared with your family via our software for a number of reasons that you will
configure.
As part of an emergency alert we
share the real-time location of the device for 3 hours. After this time,
tracking automatically stops and current and historical location is hidden. 
Our Safe Path route monitoring
collects location info during the periods you set it to be active. As above,
during the active period you can see the location of the device via your
account. 3 hours after the end of this tracking period, the historical location
information is hidden. 
As an account holder, you may
also poll the device remotely. This information is handled in the same way as
an emergency alert- collected for 3 hours then stopped unless polled again.
IMPORTANT: COPPA
Regulation (USA only)
If you are buying a CloudPhone for use by a child aged 13 or
under located in the US, we need your explicit consent to collect personal and
location information about the child. This consent will be captured when you
activate your device. Additionally, you must have a valid credit card which we
will charge for $1.00 at the time of activation, to prove that you are an adult
capable of providing consent.  These
actions are necessary to comply with US law.",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>You can create events or ""Hangouts"" which, based on your choice, can be broadcasted publicly to people surrounding your area,or you can make the event private and invite friends through Email, Twitter and Facebook.

<p class=""p1"">To make Hangout even more social and fun we will be adding a leveling and XP (experience points) system.

<p class=""p1"">You can also add locations,  a starting and ending time, a RSVP number and some extra notes about the Hangout. The creator of the Hangout can also add special sticky notes to that Hangout, which are like updates.

</p><p>My name is Pete Markakis. I am a software engineer and web
developer. I have been the senior developer where I have created the entire
back-end for several large websites. I have worked really hard on a roommate
referral service website tool between IT jobs and even did it for credit in
college where I carried and maintained a 3.8 GPA.</p>

 I have created USA Roomies 99% and it is unique from other roommate websites including Craigslist. Given the chance the website can go so much further. I need your help
primarily for marketing, keep approving on the prototype, and to finish the
mobile version. <p></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.usaroomies.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""rooms for rent"">USARoomies.com</a> is a roommate referral service website
displaying rooms for rent and roommate profiles where members can get to know
people before making an agreement to live together. Users have the option and are encouraged to be
verified to add another element of security. <br/></p><p>The tool is for:</p>
<ul>
<li> Students (dorm or
     off-campus roommates)</li>
<li> Property owners
     that have a vacant room for rent</li>
<li> Organizations
     that double up people in a hotel room for a event or training</li>
<li> Student
     Properties and Campus Housing</li>
<li> Individuals who want
     to save money by sharing rent and utility responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>USA Roomies’ private organization groups are unique and can range
from a university for campus housing to an orchestra that plays out of town
that doubles up their musicians and workers. If an approved group is set up by an organization
leader, members are joined to the group by the email address the leader sets up and or a password. The organization leader has several setting options they can set for their group. The website tool is for any country to use, if a
group leader needs to set up an event in a different country than the United States for their attendees to obtain roommates. There is nothing like this on the internet! <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Did I mention the referral website is <b>100% free</b>! I am planning on for now having it as a member donation, if you can donate. In the future I would always like to keep it very reasonable annual price for everyone and especially college students or free if I can. I am working on the tier prices for an organization for a private group annual membership in the future to keep the website running first.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your contributions and your continued support are very much appreciated and given the chance will
get USA Roomies found on the internet by building the SEO naturally in time.
There are some really good perks also, especially if you are an organization
that can use our roommate services. </p>

Right now I am just paying 10.00 a month for the hosting were this is all I pay out. The web hosting can handle 200 people all the same time on the website. I can do a campaign in just specific United State cities and pay for a server accordingly. I can let my backers decide on what city, cities, U.S. regions or states they would like the money marketed to go to. I am the founder and own USA Roomies 100% and maybe as I continue to grow the business I can obtain investors.

We are a small company of devoted music technologists, musicians and gear nerds based in Berkeley, CA. We make MIDI, CV/Gate, and OSC controllers that allow for creative expression over three dimensions of gestures, are highly customizable yet simple to implement, and integrate into all forms of studios and set ups - vintage and cutting edge.
What is QuNeo?
QuNeo is a 3D pad controller that allows the performer three dimensions of expression, simultaneously, over the X, Y, and Z axis.

Find out more about QuNeo on our website: www.keithmcmillen.com/quneo
What is Rogue?
Rogue is an accessory for the QuNeo that supplies long lasting battery power and an incredibly robust wireless connection to a computer.





Rogue attaches quickly and easily to the bottom of your QuNeo with low-profile velcro.
Battery life for Rogue exceeds 12 hours (in time-trials we saw it function over 16 hours).
Rogue uses advanced radio technology with a 2.45GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band. 
With easily changed hi-gain antennas attached to the USB dongle, wireless range can be tailored to your needs from 50 to 200 meters.
LEDs on the Rogue indicate RF link status, battery life and charging activity for instant visual feedback.
QuNeo's intelligent LED display is fully programmable and data-rich; you will rarely have to look at your computer screen.

Artists and Press say...



""The idea of having a really sophisticated controller that's completely wireless would really open up a lot of opportunities that currently don't exist."" - Dan Deacon (yes, that Dan Deacon!)

""I love this controller; it's absolutely amazing.  They're going to make my favorite controller even better- by making it wireless!"" - Thavius Beck (Producer/Artist, Dubspot Instructor, Ableton Certified Trainer)


""KMI told me about the Rogue and my brain started flipping out a little bit."" - Jack Conte (Pomplemoose, Patreon) (built a QuNeo playing robot!)

<p>What if you could create your own money?   What would it say?  What image would be on it?  What denominations would it be?</p>
<div class=""template asset"" style=""margin-left: 150px;""><img alt=""IndieGoGo Virtual Coin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s16.postimage.org/7zaskkx35/indiegogocoin.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""IndieGoGo Coin""/></div>
<p>We created a site where you can literally make money.   Each virtual coin created on our site has a face value that can be cashed out for real money. Each coin has a name, a description, a link, a wish, and a message for others to see.   Want to make a deal?   Each coin can also contain a promotional offer that only be redeemed by the person who wins the coin.   These offers must be promotions rather than discounts.  They are always worth a free product, service, or money with no conditions.   Examples include a complimentary dinner for two, a free two night stay at a hotel, a free copy of an ebook, a free download of a game, a gift card worth $25, etc.</p>
<h1><strong>How does WinMyCoins work?</strong></h1>
<p><a href=""http://winmycoins.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WinMyCoins.com</a> combines the creativity of minting your own virtual coins with the ability to win coins other members have created. All virtual coins on<a href=""http://winmycoins.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WinMyCoins.com</a> have a real cash face value printed on the coin. Members create coins for other members to discover and win!  Coins can also be added to member created challenges, themes, and coin collecting contests.</p>
<h1><strong>What makes WinMyCoins unique?</strong></h1>
<p>We spent a lot of time planning and brainstorming ideas that would make WinMyCoins unique, fun, informational, and rewarding.    </p>
<p>We started with the idea of coin collecting online.   There are an estimated 150 million people in the United States alone collecting coins.  Originally we considered the idea of digitizing existing coin collections but decided creating your own money would be more fun.</p>
<p>Next we wanted the money people created to be able to be found by others.  We came up with the idea of playing online games to win coins.   People love to play online games and to be able to win coins worth real money should have wide appeal.</p>
<p>Finally we wanted the coins to have value.  If people created millions of dollars in virtual coins that had no tangible worth, the novelty would soon wear off.  So we decided each coin would have a face value worth actual money. </p>
<p>The end result is a unique site where people play games, win coins worth real money, create their own money, and promote themselves and/or their businesses to a passionate member community.  We are just getting started, but we have big dreams!</p>
<h1>How WinMyCoins works:</h1>
<p><strong>Play online games to win coins.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone receives 10 chances to win coins every 24 hours.  For each chance, a virtual coin is displayed.   You then play a game of chance to determine if you've won or lost the coin.   Currently the only game of chance is a heads or tails coin flip.   We plan to add a variety of fun games to win coins, such as a spinning wheel, matching game, popping bubbles, etc.</p>
<p>If you win the coin toss, you win the coin.  The coin is added to your collection and can be redeemed for the face value in real money at any time.  If the coin has a promotional offer, you can choose to redeem the promotional offer instead of the face value.  </p>
<p>When you run out of your daily chances, you can earn up to 10 more chances each day by clicking the links in the coins others have created.   You'll learn more about the coin while receiving more chances to win.</p>
<p><strong>Create your own money for others to win!</strong></p>
<p>Creating coins on <a href=""http://winmycoins.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WinMyCoins.com</a> is fun and easy.  Simply choose a photo to upload and fill out a form to complete the coin creation process.  The amount of coins and face value of each coin is up to you.   As the virtual coins are worth real money, they cost real money to create.   For example, if you wish to create 100 5-cent coins, the cost would be a total of $5.00.   Those that win each of your 5-cent coins will be able to cash them out for the face value in real money.</p>
<p><strong>Promote yourself!</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are a proud parent, a hobbyist, a business owner, an athlete, an inventor, a model, an artist, etc, creating virtual coins for others to discover and win is a perfect way to promote yourself.    Each virtual coin created has its own story that is told in the image, the fortune, wish, description and link.  You also have the opportunity to send a message to everyone who wins coins you create.  Those viewing your coins can send you a message about your coin as well.  Just like IndieGoGo projects, you can reach people who may have otherwise never known about you.</p>
<h1>WinMyCoins IOS and Android App IndieGoGo Project </h1>
<p>Our goal at WinMyCoins is to facilitate online coin collecting driven by a passionate member community where members are increasingly rewarded as the site grows larger.</p>
<p>Membership is completely free on WinMyCoins and there is no purchase requirement or membership cost in winning coins created by others.   People love free stuff, especially when there is no catch or gimmicks involved.   In less than two months we've already had over 325 members register and win coins.  A whopping 20% of the members that register return on a daily basis to win coins.  It's fun, free, and addicting.  Even without an aggressive marketing campaign we are reaching new people every day.</p>
<p>We are thrilled about the response thus far, yet from the beginning our goal has been to have 99% of our members access our servers via a free phone app for Android and iPhone <strong>without ads.  </strong>This would enable hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people to access WinMyCoins from the convenience of their smart phones.</p>
<p>We've come a long way to reach this point and have beg, borrowed, and begged some more to invest over $50,000 of our own money to develop and launch our site.  We are on IndieGoGo to reach out to others who see the potential in WinMyCoins and are willing to help us get our phone app developed.</p>
<p>Ultimately we envision our site containing tens of thousands of virtual coins with a wide range of face values and promotional items to a community of members to who love to create, discover and win the coins.  Having a phone app for Android and iPhone is vital in order to enable a wide audience to easily access our site.</p>
<h1>What features will the application contain?</h1>
<p>Peoople already love to play games on their phones.  There are thousands of games out there to download on both Android and IOS platforms.   Our WinMyCoins application will contain several games of chance.   Users of our application will play the games to win coins.   Each user will have so many tries every 24 hours to win coins.   Some of the games we envision include a simple coin flip, a roulette wheel full of coins and the coin you land on is the coin you win, a matching game where the first three coins that match is the coin you win, popping bubbles to reveal coins, etc.</p>
<p>The applciation will use GPS information to target your general geographical location.   What makes WinMyCoins ultimately unique is thatmany of the coins you win will be coins merchants have created in your local area with promotional offers that you can store on your phone and take into their store.</p>
<p>For example, you are in southern California and you play games and win coins.  One of the coins you win is a penny coin created by a local restaurant. The coin contains a link that will display a promotional offer from the restaurant.  You click the link and you learn you are an instant winner of a free dinner for two with no conditions.  You realize the restaurant is only a 10 minute drive away so you drive there and display the coin you've won on your phone.  The restaurant marks the coin as redeemed and you enjoy your dinner for two.</p>
<p>The application will also have an easy to use interface where you can mint your own virtual coins using images stored on your phone.   Just like the WinMyCoins.com website, you'll be able to enter the coins you've won into contests and challenges, trade coins with other members, list your coins for sale, and browse the coins other members have won all from the convenience of your Android or IOS device.</p>
<h1>How the IndieGoGo funds will be used</h1>
<p>Our research has indicated that we can have a basic application developed for Android and iPhone on a budget of around $5,000.  This would be a <strong>huge</strong> step forward for our company.   </p>
<p>If we are fortunate to receive pledges beyond our goal, we will use the additional funds to develop a more feature rich phone application, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing new games of chance for members to play and win coins through our app.  One example would be a spinning roulette wheel full of coins, and where the wheel stops is the coin that is won.</li>
<li>Adding additional desired but not mandatory application features such as sound effects, coin animations, an improved social media interface for sharing and communicating, additional coin creation tools, contests, and more.</li>
</ul><p>We would absolutely love to build a feature rich completely free application for Android and iPhone that would never contain any ads.  Whether basic or feature rich, our critical need is to have an app for people to enjoy.</p>
<p>We decided to use the flexible funding option as we are not sitting idly by hoping to raise money.  If we do not reach our goal we will use the partial funds raised to first develop the IOS application.  Eventually we will develop free phone apps for Android and IOS with no ads so that members all over the world can enjoy playing games and winning coins.   Any help you provide will go a long ways and is greatly appreciated.</p>
<h1>Our IndieGoGo rewards</h1>
<p>We wholly and sincerely appreciate every single penny that is pledged by the amazing IndieGoGo community and we are happy to offer rewards to our backers.    These include:</p>

Notably, Mark received front page coverage in the Business Section of the San Diego Union Tribune regarding Bang Out as “The Money Behind The Games” <a href=""http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/business/20071012-9999-1b12tech.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/business/20071012-9999-1b12tech.html</a></p>
<p>In 2008, Mark began managing IT development at Union Bank of California. In Q4, 2009, with his brother Wayne, a seasoned stock broker and former bank VP for 7 years, Mark started InvestP2P to solve the numerous pain points entrepreneurs have when trying to build a business.

The applciation will use GPS information to target your general geographical location.   What makes WinMyCoins ultimately unique is thatmany of the coins you win will be coins merchants have created in your local area with promotional offers that you can store on your phone and take into their store.
For example, you are in southern California and you play games and win coins.  One of the coins you win is a penny coin created by a local restaurant. The coin contains a link that will display a promotional offer from the restaurant.  You click the link and you learn you are an instant winner of a free dinner for two with no conditions.  You realize the restaurant is only a 10 minute drive away so you drive there and display the coin you've won on your phone.  The restaurant marks the coin as redeemed and you enjoy your dinner for two.
The application will also have an easy to use interface where you can mint your own virtual coins using images stored on your phone.   Just like the WinMyCoins.com website, you'll be able to enter the coins you've won into contests and challenges, trade coins with other members, list your coins for sale, and browse the coins other members have won all from the convenience of your Android or IOS device.
How the IndieGoGo funds will be used
Our research has indicated that we can have a basic application developed for Android and iPhone on a budget of around $5,000.  This would be a huge step forward for our company.   
If we are fortunate to receive pledges beyond our goal, we will use the additional funds to develop a more feature rich phone application, including:

Designing new games of chance for members to play and win coins through our app.  One example would be a spinning roulette wheel full of coins, and where the wheel stops is the coin that is won.
Adding additional desired but not mandatory application features such as sound effects, coin animations, an improved social media interface for sharing and communicating, additional coin creation tools, contests, and more.
We would absolutely love to build a feature rich completely free application for Android and iPhone that would never contain any ads.  Whether basic or feature rich, our critical need is to have an app for people to enjoy.
We decided to use the flexible funding option as we are not sitting idly by hoping to raise money.  If we do not reach our goal we will use the partial funds raised to first develop the IOS application.  Eventually we will develop free phone apps for Android and IOS with no ads so that members all over the world can enjoy playing games and winning coins.   Any help you provide will go a long ways and is greatly appreciated.

<p>Simplicity. No need to manually hold focus, focus it once with the knob, and then it’s as easy as holding your phone. Use it to take photos, videos, panoramics, slow-mo, or even time-lapse! Optics click into alignment, samples are held down with a clip, and the illumination is built in using an energy efficient LED with two AAA batteries for hours of battery life. Finally the sample doesn’t touch the lens, which always keeps the lens clean and your samples pure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
</p>
<p>Versatility with 30, 50, or 170 times optical magnification and 1.5-2 micron resolution, lets you look closer at almost anything, whether it's a detailed macro-view of surface features to the inside of tiny cells. POWERUP pledges features magnification of 30, 170, and 340 times. Also this works in combination with your smartphones digital magnification. For example, you could magnify 4.5 times into an 8-megapixel image and still be looking at a DVD-quality picture. This 4.5x digital multiplies with the 340x optical to provide between 340 to 1530 times combined magnification. Thus each lens has a range of magnification and the upper limit improves as your camera is upgraded! Plus the lens assembly's are swappable and hackable! Finally the use of slides is optional, but we do recommend coverslips if looking at wet samples at high magnification.</p>

</p>
<p>In research, microscopes are an undeniably important tool, but this is the first to really give them the versatility along with the power and portability that they need in order to do a proper job. With this tool, one could follow a rare toxic species of bacteria as it zips across the slide, identify an insect under higher magnification, then classify rock samples. My goal is to build a platform.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
</p>
<p>And not only will your support make this microscope a reality, it will enable further research and development to improve upon what we have today. The design although compact is actually still quite flexible, it can incorporate a wide variety of optic systems and illumination systems. And if this project succeeds, I’ll have the resources to invest in improving the design to enable higher magnification, better resolution, less distortion, and possibly even new features such as fluorescent microscopy. This future model may become one of the best field microscopes available.</p>

</b></p><p><b>Production Plan: <br/>
Update: Since we have a smaller order volume, I'm planning on producing these microscopes via the Form1+ 3D printer. I also don't want higher volume until I actually start producing these and seeing what kind of timetables/expenses occur (manufacturing is tough and full of surprises). But! This is not a step down in quality, it is by all means a Step Up! The Form1+ 3D printer has the best print quality out of all the consumer 3D printers and a lot of the commercial ones too. In terms of quality, it might actually be better than these nearly $400 prototypes I've been ordering. Also I'll be able to produce microscopes that are more compact, because I can disregard the design limitations involved with injection molding. And there are naturally no injection molding companies to delay production. Finally if I come up with any more improvements, I can work them in up until I start producing them. This production change is completely within the budget and will not result in addition charges.</b></p><b>
</b><p>The first step after finishing this campaign is finalizing the design by incorporating the last few updates, which although make almost no difference to the aesthetics will definitely improve its ease of use. This will take another two weeks max, mostly taken up by the week and a half needed to get the parts 3D printed and shipped to us. During this waiting period, I will be hiring an appropriate number of helpers.</p>
<p>Once the design is finalized, there are two things that will happen simultaneously: <br/>
1. I’m probably going to use a third-party shipping fulfillment service to make sure shipping is handled smoothly, and I will be getting in touch with them early on to get an idea of our shipping deadlines. <br/>
2. I will begin working on the getting the injection molds created for the plastic parts. This will either be: A. Me working on the molds themselves because I have access to industrial CAM software, a CNC mill, and the injection molding equipment. And also some of the parts are extremely simple like the knob or lid, and the rest of the components are still not much more complicated than tupperware. B. Outsourcing of the tooling for the molds to a US-based company, because while they’re working on tooling I can work on something else. C. A combination of A and B to push forward the tooling process for the molds as quickly as possible. <br/>
3. I will start ordering all the parts except for the 3D printed mounts. These mounts are the size of a pencil’s eraser head and can be printed in a net in the hundreds, and we do want to do this last which will be explained at the end. Most of the suppliers for the parts are already identified, the ones that aren’t are for very generic parts that have dozens of suppliers. <br/>
So all of this gives us flexibility, because we can quickly identify which aspects are problematic and then work on addressing it early in the manufacturing process. Suppliers were a big issue for a lot of tech campaigns, and luckily nothing we need is particularly exotic. So we can always find additional suppliers, but this way we find out early and avoid delays. And being able to work on the tooling process itself, also gives me additional flexibility to push where it’s needed. We plan on this process taking one month, and how can this all be accomplished in one month? Well, that’s why we hired helpers earlier. If there’s a delay in getting the molds, I will get my helpers started on parts that require additional work, such as soldering all the electronic bits together, while I push forward the tooling.</p>
<p>Once we have all the molds, I will start the production of the plastic parts themselves, and will direct my helpers to start producing and adding in the basic components (whichever ones we have already received): like laser-cutting the acrylic stage cover piece, gluing in the stage cover piece, applying the restickable adhesive, putting in the stage clips, putting in the electronics, and etc, while I work on machining the tubes that hold everything in place. The plastic parts will be designed, such that I can buy appropriately sized round stock to cut the amount of machining in half. Plus this will be done in a jig so that dozens can be produced simultaneously even by someone unskilled in machining. (It’s all automated, so it’s just pressing the stop button if something happens). If any supplier could potentially delay us, I will deal with it immediately and any contract I sign with them will include deadlines with consequences for failure to meet them. For example, canceling the remainder of our order and refunding our money, so that we can purchase from another supplier. Because flat out, I don’t want to have to tell you why your Christmas present won’t make it in time, I will keep my promises. Otherwise we will be producing complete microscopes from start to finish in batches, and checking the quality with measurements and reference slides. This will take two months.</p>
<p>Then I will 3D print the mounts that hold the optics in place and it is here I can compensate for any systematic deviations that occur during production. The last assembly step is just installing the optics and mounts, then we need to get all the packaging done. We expect this to take another month.</p>
<p>Finally there's that last month of buffer and just getting the orders shipped to you.</p>
<p>Everything is going to happen within the US, so I can keep a closer eye on the process. And overall, design considerations to ensure mass-producibility, and the level of control with vertical integration and proximity allows me to ensure delivery along with meeting delivery deadlines. The greatest risk to this project is simply not reaching our funding goal. Throughout the entire process, we will be paying close attention to you (our wonderful supporters!), providing regular updates as we make progress =)</p>
<p>Budget: <br/>
*All conservative estimates <br/>
- 10% goes to Indiegogo and credit card processing fees <br/>
- 15% goes to shipping and packaging <br/>
- 30% goes to raw material cost of every physical thing on the microscope (15% of that 30% is for the one high-powered lens) <br/>
- The last 45% is composed of the cost of general assistance, in-house production of small parts for the microscope from raw materials, assembly, making the molds, and then whatever profit we make. <br/>
- As for the prepared microscope slides, and blank slides and coverslips, it costs just a little less than what we charge. It’s just for your convenience =) <br/>
If we hit our bare minimum of $15,000, it would be a break-even if we outsourced all tooling. This is why in this case I would do some of the tooling myself and handle all the small part production and assembly, because $15,000 represents ~150 orders, which means it takes less time to fulfill and doing some tooling myself allows more buffer. So as you can see, if we hit our funding goal, we can definitely deliver without asking for more money. And if we exceed our funding goal, I can just delegate more of the work and still avoid a net loss.</p>
<p>This meticulous research, planning, and attention to detail is what makes sure you get an excellent product on time.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","Combine your digital magnification with native 30/50/170x or 30/170/340x to get between 30 to >1000x!

Enable yourself or the people you love to learn more about the world around us, not from a lecture, textbook, or computer, but straight from nature itself. And then fascinate yourself for hours, days, or maybe even a lifetime with the things you’ll end up discovering.



In research, microscopes are an undeniably important tool, but this is the first to really give them the versatility along with the power and portability that they need in order to do a proper job. With this tool, one could follow a rare toxic species of bacteria as it zips across the slide, identify an insect under higher magnification, then classify rock samples. My goal is to build a platform.





And not only will your support make this microscope a reality, it will enable further research and development to improve upon what we have today. The design although compact is actually still quite flexible, it can incorporate a wide variety of optic systems and illumination systems. And if this project succeeds, I’ll have the resources to invest in improving the design to enable higher magnification, better resolution, less distortion, and possibly even new features such as fluorescent microscopy. This future model may become one of the best field microscopes available.

Then one day, I read a research article about how to make a cheap DIY microscope with my smartphone. And it kinda worked, was really hard to hold everything in the right place, but it was awesome to actually see something as tiny as individual red blood cells on my phone. And it was around this same time that a friend of mine whose a wildlife immunologist was complaining about how all the field microscopes available sucked. I was interested in working on this project and offered to make her a better one! Long story short, I kept on trying different prototypes and working on it on and off for almost a year until I finally settled on what we have today. In the end, I’m very happy with the results!""Shows the overhang that avoids features that jut out near the camera, and how the spacers can be used to accommodate cameras at various heights.Panoramic image of a bee worker leg at ~67x (30x optical with 3x digital)Pine Stem: Left: Composite image at ~146x (30x optical with 4.87x digital).

Production Plan: 
Update: Since we have a smaller order volume, I'm planning on producing these microscopes via the Form1+ 3D printer. I also don't want higher volume until I actually start producing these and seeing what kind of timetables/expenses occur (manufacturing is tough and full of surprises). But! This is not a step down in quality, it is by all means a Step Up! The Form1+ 3D printer has the best print quality out of all the consumer 3D printers and a lot of the commercial ones too. In terms of quality, it might actually be better than these nearly $400 prototypes I've been ordering. Also I'll be able to produce microscopes that are more compact, because I can disregard the design limitations involved with injection molding. And there are naturally no injection molding companies to delay production. Finally if I come up with any more improvements, I can work them in up until I start producing them. This production change is completely within the budget and will not result in addition charges.
The first step after finishing this campaign is finalizing the design by incorporating the last few updates, which although make almost no difference to the aesthetics will definitely improve its ease of use. This will take another two weeks max, mostly taken up by the week and a half needed to get the parts 3D printed and shipped to us. During this waiting period, I will be hiring an appropriate number of helpers.
Once the design is finalized, there are two things that will happen simultaneously: 
1. I’m probably going to use a third-party shipping fulfillment service to make sure shipping is handled smoothly, and I will be getting in touch with them early on to get an idea of our shipping deadlines. 
2. I will begin working on the getting the injection molds created for the plastic parts. This will either be: A. Me working on the molds themselves because I have access to industrial CAM software, a CNC mill, and the injection molding equipment. And also some of the parts are extremely simple like the knob or lid, and the rest of the components are still not much more complicated than tupperware. B. Outsourcing of the tooling for the molds to a US-based company, because while they’re working on tooling I can work on something else. C. A combination of A and B to push forward the tooling process for the molds as quickly as possible. 
3. I will start ordering all the parts except for the 3D printed mounts. These mounts are the size of a pencil’s eraser head and can be printed in a net in the hundreds, and we do want to do this last which will be explained at the end. Most of the suppliers for the parts are already identified, the ones that aren’t are for very generic parts that have dozens of suppliers. 
So all of this gives us flexibility, because we can quickly identify which aspects are problematic and then work on addressing it early in the manufacturing process. Suppliers were a big issue for a lot of tech campaigns, and luckily nothing we need is particularly exotic. So we can always find additional suppliers, but this way we find out early and avoid delays. And being able to work on the tooling process itself, also gives me additional flexibility to push where it’s needed. We plan on this process taking one month, and how can this all be accomplished in one month? Well, that’s why we hired helpers earlier. If there’s a delay in getting the molds, I will get my helpers started on parts that require additional work, such as soldering all the electronic bits together, while I push forward the tooling.
Once we have all the molds, I will start the production of the plastic parts themselves, and will direct my helpers to start producing and adding in the basic components (whichever ones we have already received): like laser-cutting the acrylic stage cover piece, gluing in the stage cover piece, applying the restickable adhesive, putting in the stage clips, putting in the electronics, and etc, while I work on machining the tubes that hold everything in place. The plastic parts will be designed, such that I can buy appropriately sized round stock to cut the amount of machining in half. Plus this will be done in a jig so that dozens can be produced simultaneously even by someone unskilled in machining. (It’s all automated, so it’s just pressing the stop button if something happens). If any supplier could potentially delay us, I will deal with it immediately and any contract I sign with them will include deadlines with consequences for failure to meet them. For example, canceling the remainder of our order and refunding our money, so that we can purchase from another supplier. Because flat out, I don’t want to have to tell you why your Christmas present won’t make it in time, I will keep my promises. Otherwise we will be producing complete microscopes from start to finish in batches, and checking the quality with measurements and reference slides. This will take two months.
Then I will 3D print the mounts that hold the optics in place and it is here I can compensate for any systematic deviations that occur during production. The last assembly step is just installing the optics and mounts, then we need to get all the packaging done. We expect this to take another month.
Finally there's that last month of buffer and just getting the orders shipped to you.
Everything is going to happen within the US, so I can keep a closer eye on the process. And overall, design considerations to ensure mass-producibility, and the level of control with vertical integration and proximity allows me to ensure delivery along with meeting delivery deadlines. The greatest risk to this project is simply not reaching our funding goal. Throughout the entire process, we will be paying close attention to you (our wonderful supporters!), providing regular updates as we make progress =)
Budget: 
*All conservative estimates 
- 10% goes to Indiegogo and credit card processing fees 
- 15% goes to shipping and packaging 
- 30% goes to raw material cost of every physical thing on the microscope (15% of that 30% is for the one high-powered lens) 
- The last 45% is composed of the cost of general assistance, in-house production of small parts for the microscope from raw materials, assembly, making the molds, and then whatever profit we make. 
- As for the prepared microscope slides, and blank slides and coverslips, it costs just a little less than what we charge. It’s just for your convenience =) 
If we hit our bare minimum of $15,000, it would be a break-even if we outsourced all tooling. This is why in this case I would do some of the tooling myself and handle all the small part production and assembly, because $15,000 represents ~150 orders, which means it takes less time to fulfill and doing some tooling myself allows more buffer. So as you can see, if we hit our funding goal, we can definitely deliver without asking for more money. And if we exceed our funding goal, I can just delegate more of the work and still avoid a net loss.
This meticulous research, planning, and attention to detail is what makes sure you get an excellent product on time.",14.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>We know that technology that we are developing will change the lives of so many people, but for that to happen we really need your help. Your gifts will help countless millions of needy people who might otherwise not be able to afford current technologies, for instance, Microsoft's suit of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. plus so many other products. We provide alternative solutions to meet their needs, as well as a host of other valuable tools hosted within the World's FIRST, TRUE Web-Based Operating System.</p>
<p><b>Having The Right Tools Matters. <br/></b></p>
<p><b>Making Those Tools Available for Free is Our Goal.<br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Technology is the Great Divider in our Society today.</b></p>
<p>Introducing the Worlds FIRST, Universally Accessible, Cross-Platform, TRUE Web-Based Operating System. Using predominantly Open Source technologies, we will delivery the desktop experience from within your web browser. </p>
<p>A window-like interface allows you to work in a familiar Desktop environment that requires little in the way of a learning curve. There will be plenty of useful applications delivered free to you with your account. Web Applications such as Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Presentations, IM, Chat, Collaboration tools, Mail Tools, Our Own Video Streaming service, Easy-to-Use Web Publishing Tools, and so much more will be available with a basic amount of storage space in our own secure cloud storage for FREE! Any time! Anywhere!</p>
<p>Access our Web OS from any system whether it be Tablet, Laptop, Desktop, mobile or otherwise. Windows? Linux? MAC? Android? It doesn't matter. As long as you have a W3C, standards-compliant Web-Browser, you are Golden. Not sure if your browser will be supported. We check for you. If not, we will have a direct download link and instructions for installing the latest and best in Open-Source, Standards-Compliant Web Browsing technology. Free up space on your systems, whether mobile, or desktop, so that you have more room available for the things that matter such as Pictures and Video. Your system will run faster.</p>
<p>Got Kids? We are working hard to make an environment that is Kid-Safe for them and can be linked to a parental account for under-aged users so parents can have better visibility into what a child is doing while at the same time respecting their need for privacy. We have kids too, so we understand your worries. Kids can access the system from home to create presentations, documents, etc, then go to school, polish things up a bit and do their presentation to the class from a Web-Enabled computer or submit their essay to the teacher in the format required by the class(*.doc, *.docx, *.xls, etc) to help ace their class. Same goes for everyone else accessing our technology. <br/></p>
<p>Schools can realize huge savings by installing
 a free Linux OS and accessing all the Word Processing, Spreadsheet and 
Presentation tools at school,as well as all the other tools that we will
 avail to them, and use the same Web-Based OS from home. With most 
schools still stuck with older systems, having a base Linux system can 
improve performance over the Windows XP based systems that are installed
 on most older systems found in most schools.<br/></p>
<p>The access-anywhere aspect of this technology and support for file-types goes beyond the capabilities of most other systems and uses Open Source technology to achieve a high level of support for a variety of formats too numerous to list.</p>
<p>Want to create a small website but have felt daunted by the task? We have you covered. If you can type in a Word Processor, you have the skills needed to get started. We handle the complicated stuff so you end up looking cool on the web.</p>
<p>You have the <b>WANT</b> and the <i><b>aspiration</b></i> to do this, but may not the <i>technical capability</i>, and we want to put the technical capability into your hands, as well as millions of others who have the creative spark within them, but no outlet to express that creativity in a <b>brilliant </b>way. Our technology will be the enabler for all of your creative aspirations.</p>
<p>A great example of what can be accomplished can be found at:</p>
<p>         <a href=""http://www.theadventurechallenge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.TheAdventureChallenge.com/</a></p>
<p>The Adventure Challenge website and what we are doing with it is our gift to everyone who is helping us raise funds, both for Frabjulous and the Children's Pediatric Brain Tumour Foundation, which you can learn more about at <a href=""http://www.TheAdventureChallenge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Adventure Challenge</a> website.<br/></p>
<p>Want to stay in touch with others? Share Memories? You have full access to everything, to do anything your imagination will allow. With access to our technologies, combined with your imagination, you can soar. Nothing will be beyond your reach.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Analysts are
 always so ready to talk about the death of the Windows desktop. With 
the advent of the mobile revolution,we have taken further steps in that 
direction, and as the video above alludes, the Windows Desktop is dying.
 Our technology will be a decisive blow to the windows desktop. We are 
going to drag that Memory hungry monster out behind the woodshed and put it out of its
 misery, forever. </p>
<p>There are still so many old systems out their 
that are single core CPU's and are being used because people don't have 
the ability to purchase newer systems. Schools still use older PC's because budgetary constraints have limited their ability to upgrade. Often times, the systems used in schools are refurbished from systems that might otherwise have gone into the landfill. Let's not forget our schools! 
Our technology will rejuvenate their systems. We will show them the 
path.  Our technology will rule their systems.</p>
<p>My vision is for 
Windows to become a dumb terminal thru which users will use the 
web-browser to access our technology. All the bloat can be removed from 
the system. Windows would become a host for Local hardware and for the 
browser. Not only Windows, but also Linux, Apple and any OS that can run
 a fully compliant W3C  Web-browser. Our technology will work independent of the Operating System.<br/></p>
<p>This is the first stage in our
 roadmap for which we are raising these funds. Your gifts can make this 
happen for the world, and it will benefit so many. The poor and the 
middle class make up a huge portion of our society, not to mention all 
those students in high school and college. Everyone will have access, and our software will be made simple to use for all levels of user from beginners, to intermdiates to professionals alike.<br/></p>
<p>The great divide betwen the rich and the poor is growing every day. Do you think I am being overly dramatic about the chasm between the rich and the poor? Though the current Administration tries to paint a rosy picture of the economic situation, because of the agenda's being pushed thru our goverment, the business environment is becoming a less friendly place for job growth. Read the article in the following link on the Fox News website which reports on data from the Associate Press.</p></span><span style=""color: Red; font-size: 24px;"">

<br/><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><h1>Getting to Know the Creator</h1>
<p>My name is Steven Hall. I was born and bred in NC. I kinda like to think of myself as an educated red-neck. I may have mad skills these days, but I never forget that I grew up poor. I don't look down on anyone, no matter your walk of life. In fact, this project has been inspired somewhat by my experience of growing up less fortunate than others. I have realized over the years, that the great divide between the rich and the poor is due in no small part to access to technology, which is the gateway to a better life. We are creating a technology that will empower everyone with tools to unleash their creativity and imagination, and we are giving it to you for FREE. </p>
<p>
</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/FZtxE_ZRi04"" width=""420""></iframe></div>
<p></p>
Trust is very important to me. I want you to understand and Trust that I am leveraging my skills to touch the lives of everyone and hopefully change people's lives by giving them easy access to Technology they wouldn't otherwise have access to or don't have the skills or finances necessary to achieve their dreams otherwise.<h1>Open Source Technologies</h1>
<p>As mentioned, whenever possible, we want to use Open Source alternatives to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>Obvious things would be stuff such as jQuery, and a ton of open source plugins plus I will use jQuery to create my own plugins to support custom functionality not already available. </p>
<p>To support all the Word Processing, Spread Sheet and Presentation 
Formats, we will use either Open Source Libraries that support our chosen file 
formats and conversions to other formats, or Open Source applications that expose 
this functionality as objects that we can make use of in our Technology.</p>
<h1>Keeping You in the Loop</h1>
<p>Our technology has massive implications on the future of technology and society. It would be almost impossible to cover it all here. Therefore, I have created a Web Meeting space that I will host daily to answer any and all questions.</p>
<p>The Schedule for our upcoming Web Meetings can be found at the link below:</p>
<p><i><b><a href=""https://www.anymeeting.com/Frabjulous"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frabjulous WebMeetings Schedule</a></b></i></p>
<p>Invitations to the WebMeetings can be had by emailing me at: </p>
<p><i><b>FrabMeetings(at)nc&lt;dot&gt;rr&lt;dot&gt;com</b></i></p>
<p>For more information about anything else Frabjulous, email me at:</p>
<p><i><b>frabjulous(at)nc&lt;dot&gt;rr&lt;dot&gt;com</b></i></p>
<p><i>Of course, replace (at) with @ and &lt;dot&gt; with a period.</i></p>
<p>Frabjulous is also on twitter, so add me so you can keep up with my daily thoughts and ideas and maybe reach out to me with yours.</p>
<h1> <i><b>We aspire to do great things.</b></i>
</h1>Our Ultimate Goal is to raise over <b>$2,000,000+</b>. This will allow us to do so many great things that will ultimately make this a long term success. If we meet certain milestones in our fund-raising campaign towards the $2,000,000 mark, some really cool things are going to happen. <p>We have started a separate website, called <i><b><a href=""http://theadventurechallenge.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Adventure Challenge</a> </b></i>that will show things we will do if we hit certain milestones in our fund-raising campaign. Long Story short, we have a few milestones for our campaign:</p>
<br/>Milestone #1: $250,000.00<br/><br/>Milestone #2: $500,000.00<br/><br/><p>Milestone #3: $750,000.00</p>
<p>Milestone #4: $1,000,000.00</p>
<p>Milestone #5: $1,500,000.00</p>
<p>Milestone #6: $2,000,000.00+</p>
<p>When we pass each of the milestones, we pledge to do what we call Adventure Challenges. This is something we are introducing that is totally new to any CrowdFunding Platform, and is hugely exciting to me.</p>
<p> An Adventure Challenge involves me, Steven Hall, performing Wild Adventures that challenge my skills in the outdoors, which are relatively few, being as, for the last 14-15 years I have been mostly busy riding a desk chair and pounding the keyboard, using my ample mental capabilities to enhance products for other companies, while at the same time, starting a family. Now these Adventure Challenges will take me out of my comfort zone and thrust me into new Adventures that will pump up my adrenaline and test my will to survive, <i><b>literally</b></i>. Best of all, for Milestones #5 and #6, we are involving you, the Contributors in our Adventure Challenges. You will have a chance to help shape how these particular Adventure Challenges will unfold. This will only happen though, if we reach our milestones. Make sure and check out the <b><a href=""http://www.theadventurechallenge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TheAdventureChallenge.com</a></b> website for full details.</p>
<p>Why are we doing this? These Adventure Challenges aren't just for fun. Behind the Challenges, is a great cause that we are helping to raise money and awareness about. <b><a href=""http://www.TheAdventureChallenge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TheAdventureChallenge.com</a></b>, our company TechSys America, LLP and I, Steven Hall, have partnered with the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation to help them raise money and awareness for the horrible disease that is afflicting countless children across this country and around the world. We will be raising funds for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation thru our Adventure Challenges which are tied to our IndieGoGo Goals. You can find more information at <a href=""http://www.theadventurechallenge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>TheAdventureChallenge.com</b></a>, as well as get contact information for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation so you can check it out and make sure we are legit. </p>
<p>Remember we will only be able to do the challenges from the <b><a href=""http://www.TheAdventureChallenge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TheAdventureChallenge.com</a></b> website if we meet our funding milestones outlined above and on <b><a href=""http://www.TheAdventureChallenge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TheAdventureChallenge.com</a></b> website. So by contributing to this campaign, you are not only funding a really cool technology that could change the world, but you will push me to raise money and awareness for a very worthwhile organization thru the Adventure Challenges. When we reach the $2,000,000 Goal, we will contribute $250,000 to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation, one of the largest single donations they have ever received.<br/></p></span><h1><span class=""notranlsate""><b>How will we use the Funds?</b></span></h1><p>Our Ultimate Goal is $2,000,000. We will use these fund as follows:</p><p>1) Storage Capacity: For each TB of Cloud Storage, we require a minimum of 3TB for redundancy to keep your data safe and accessible 100% of the time.</p><p>2) Server Hardware: We will need a massive amount of Server space. A minumium of 20 Fail-Over Server just for the main site at a minnimum, plus Cloud Storage Server, plus Bandwidth and server space. We plan to use a majority of the funds for this purpose. Capacity Planning is a major strategic goal for these funds.</p><p>3) Reasearch, Development and Testing: We plan to have this Web-Based Operating System Accessible and Operational within 6 to 8 months, with tons of features for you to take advantage of.</p><p>4) $250,000 will be Donated to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation. Individuals donating $100 or more will be given honorable mention on the website and a list will be made available to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation listing those giving $100 or more. Honorable mention will be given on our website for those giving $50 or more as well.</p><p><br/></p><h1>Perks</h1><p>For each $1 you gift to us, we will give you 1GB of cloud storage on the Frabjulous Platform for 2 years. Compare the savings to Google Drive (15 GB Free then $4.99/Month for 100GB). 115GB for 2 Years on Google Drive = $120 is ~$1.05/GB. You'd save ~$2.50/Year plus have all the extra benefits our Web-Based Operating System has to offer. If you only want to the Cloud Storage, donate the amount you want, even if it is more than $1, then choose the $1 Perk. We already understand that 1GB for every dollar you are donating. So if you donate $125, still select the $1 Perk if cloud storage is the only thing you desire, and we will give you 125GB of Cloud Storage.</p><p><b>Personal Thank You</b></p><p>For those giving $15, $25, or more we want to personally Thank You, but we can't travel around the coutry and the world to everyone's home to do it so we will do it with Technology. At $15 and above we will send a personal email Thanking You for your gift. At $25 and above, we will not only email a personal Thank You, but we will also send send you a link to a personalized video addressing you personally and giving you a heart felt and personalized Thank You as if we were face-to-face.<br/></p><p><b>The Adventure Challenges</b></p><p>The Adventure Challenge is a series of increasingly difficult challenges that I will partake in as we meet milestones in our Crowd Funding. For each Adventure Challenge, we will film the Challenge in All-Digital Full-HD video, and we will publish the series exclusively on our Streaming Video Service which will be part of the Frabjulous Platform. For those giving a Gift of $50 or more but below $100, in addition to everything else mention, you will also get the Adventure Challenge Series on DVD, though, the Challenges where I will survive on an uninhabited, undeveloped tropical Island for either 21 or 48 days, complete Naked, you won't get to see the naughty parts. That will be blurred out. The Series on DVD will contain bonus footage not seen in the online version. <br/></p><p>If you contribute $100 or more you will get the Adventure Challenge Series on DVD, but now this is the fully uncensored version, showing all the naughty bits, with even more additional footage you won't see on the censored version of the DVD Series.</p><p>For those who give $500 or more you get all the previous perks, plus your name will be listed as a honary donor when we donate $250,00 to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation. This list will be handed to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and your name will be listed on our site as an honorary contributor to the Frabjulous WebOS.<br/></p><h1><span class=""notranlsate""></span></h1><span class=""notranlsate""><p></p></span></div>","Help Us Reach Our Ultimate Goal to Exceed $2,000,000 in Funding

Access our Web OS from any system whether it be Tablet, Laptop, Desktop, mobile or otherwise. Windows? Linux? MAC? Android? It doesn't matter. As long as you have a W3C, standards-compliant Web-Browser, you are Golden. Not sure if your browser will be supported. We check for you. If not, we will have a direct download link and instructions for installing the latest and best in Open-Source, Standards-Compliant Web Browsing technology. Free up space on your systems, whether mobile, or desktop, so that you have more room available for the things that matter such as Pictures and Video. Your system will run faster.
Got Kids? We are working hard to make an environment that is Kid-Safe for them and can be linked to a parental account for under-aged users so parents can have better visibility into what a child is doing while at the same time respecting their need for privacy. We have kids too, so we understand your worries. Kids can access the system from home to create presentations, documents, etc, then go to school, polish things up a bit and do their presentation to the class from a Web-Enabled computer or submit their essay to the teacher in the format required by the class(*.doc, *.docx, *.xls, etc) to help ace their class. Same goes for everyone else accessing our technology. 
Schools can realize huge savings by installing
 a free Linux OS and accessing all the Word Processing, Spreadsheet and 
Presentation tools at school,as well as all the other tools that we will
 avail to them, and use the same Web-Based OS from home. With most 
schools still stuck with older systems, having a base Linux system can 
improve performance over the Windows XP based systems that are installed
 on most older systems found in most schools.
The access-anywhere aspect of this technology and support for file-types goes beyond the capabilities of most other systems and uses Open Source technology to achieve a high level of support for a variety of formats too numerous to list.
Want to create a small website but have felt daunted by the task? We have you covered. If you can type in a Word Processor, you have the skills needed to get started. We handle the complicated stuff so you end up looking cool on the web.
You have the WANT and the aspiration to do this, but may not the technical capability, and we want to put the technical capability into your hands, as well as millions of others who have the creative spark within them, but no outlet to express that creativity in a brilliant way. Our technology will be the enabler for all of your creative aspirations.
A great example of what can be accomplished can be found at:

The Adventure Challenge website and what we are doing with it is our gift to everyone who is helping us raise funds, both for Frabjulous and the Children's Pediatric Brain Tumour Foundation, which you can learn more about at The Adventure Challenge website.
Want to stay in touch with others? Share Memories? You have full access to everything, to do anything your imagination will allow. With access to our technologies, combined with your imagination, you can soar. Nothing will be beyond your reach.
We Aim to be the Desktop Killer



Analysts are
 always so ready to talk about the death of the Windows desktop. With 
the advent of the mobile revolution,we have taken further steps in that 
direction, and as the video above alludes, the Windows Desktop is dying.
 Our technology will be a decisive blow to the windows desktop. We are 
going to drag that Memory hungry monster out behind the woodshed and put it out of its
 misery, forever. 
There are still so many old systems out their 
that are single core CPU's and are being used because people don't have 
the ability to purchase newer systems. Schools still use older PC's because budgetary constraints have limited their ability to upgrade. Often times, the systems used in schools are refurbished from systems that might otherwise have gone into the landfill. Let's not forget our schools! 
Our technology will rejuvenate their systems. We will show them the 
path.  Our technology will rule their systems.
My vision is for 
Windows to become a dumb terminal thru which users will use the 
web-browser to access our technology. All the bloat can be removed from 
the system. Windows would become a host for Local hardware and for the 
browser. Not only Windows, but also Linux, Apple and any OS that can run
 a fully compliant W3C  Web-browser. Our technology will work independent of the Operating System.
This is the first stage in our
 roadmap for which we are raising these funds. Your gifts can make this 
happen for the world, and it will benefit so many. The poor and the 
middle class make up a huge portion of our society, not to mention all 
those students in high school and college. Everyone will have access, and our software will be made simple to use for all levels of user from beginners, to intermdiates to professionals alike.
The great divide betwen the rich and the poor is growing every day. Do you think I am being overly dramatic about the chasm between the rich and the poor? Though the current Administration tries to paint a rosy picture of the economic situation, because of the agenda's being pushed thru our goverment, the business environment is becoming a less friendly place for job growth. Read the article in the following link on the Fox News website which reports on data from the Associate Press.
Four in Five in US face near-poverty, no work

Getting to Know the Creator
My name is Steven Hall. I was born and bred in NC. I kinda like to think of myself as an educated red-neck. I may have mad skills these days, but I never forget that I grew up poor. I don't look down on anyone, no matter your walk of life. In fact, this project has been inspired somewhat by my experience of growing up less fortunate than others. I have realized over the years, that the great divide between the rich and the poor is due in no small part to access to technology, which is the gateway to a better life. We are creating a technology that will empower everyone with tools to unleash their creativity and imagination, and we are giving it to you for FREE. 



Trust is very important to me. I want you to understand and Trust that I am leveraging my skills to touch the lives of everyone and hopefully change people's lives by giving them easy access to Technology they wouldn't otherwise have access to or don't have the skills or finances necessary to achieve their dreams otherwise.Open Source Technologies
As mentioned, whenever possible, we want to use Open Source alternatives to achieve our goals.
Obvious things would be stuff such as jQuery, and a ton of open source plugins plus I will use jQuery to create my own plugins to support custom functionality not already available. 
To support all the Word Processing, Spread Sheet and Presentation 
Formats, we will use either Open Source Libraries that support our chosen file 
formats and conversions to other formats, or Open Source applications that expose 
this functionality as objects that we can make use of in our Technology.
Keeping You in the Loop
Our technology has massive implications on the future of technology and society. It would be almost impossible to cover it all here. Therefore, I have created a Web Meeting space that I will host daily to answer any and all questions.
The Schedule for our upcoming Web Meetings can be found at the link below:
Frabjulous WebMeetings Schedule
Invitations to the WebMeetings can be had by emailing me at: 
FrabMeetings(at)nc<dot>rr<dot>com
For more information about anything else Frabjulous, email me at:
frabjulous(at)nc<dot>rr<dot>com
Of course, replace (at) with @ and <dot> with a period.
Frabjulous is also on twitter, so add me so you can keep up with my daily thoughts and ideas and maybe reach out to me with yours.
 We aspire to do great things.
Our Ultimate Goal is to raise over $2,000,000+. This will allow us to do so many great things that will ultimately make this a long term success. If we meet certain milestones in our fund-raising campaign towards the $2,000,000 mark, some really cool things are going to happen. We have started a separate website, called The Adventure Challenge that will show things we will do if we hit certain milestones in our fund-raising campaign. Long Story short, we have a few milestones for our campaign:
Milestone #1: $250,000.00Milestone #2: $500,000.00Milestone #3: $750,000.00
Milestone #4: $1,000,000.00
Milestone #5: $1,500,000.00
Milestone #6: $2,000,000.00+
When we pass each of the milestones, we pledge to do what we call Adventure Challenges. This is something we are introducing that is totally new to any CrowdFunding Platform, and is hugely exciting to me.
 An Adventure Challenge involves me, Steven Hall, performing Wild Adventures that challenge my skills in the outdoors, which are relatively few, being as, for the last 14-15 years I have been mostly busy riding a desk chair and pounding the keyboard, using my ample mental capabilities to enhance products for other companies, while at the same time, starting a family. Now these Adventure Challenges will take me out of my comfort zone and thrust me into new Adventures that will pump up my adrenaline and test my will to survive, literally. Best of all, for Milestones #5 and #6, we are involving you, the Contributors in our Adventure Challenges. You will have a chance to help shape how these particular Adventure Challenges will unfold. This will only happen though, if we reach our milestones. Make sure and check out the TheAdventureChallenge.com website for full details.
Why are we doing this? These Adventure Challenges aren't just for fun. Behind the Challenges, is a great cause that we are helping to raise money and awareness about. TheAdventureChallenge.com, our company TechSys America, LLP and I, Steven Hall, have partnered with the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation to help them raise money and awareness for the horrible disease that is afflicting countless children across this country and around the world. We will be raising funds for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation thru our Adventure Challenges which are tied to our IndieGoGo Goals. You can find more information at TheAdventureChallenge.com, as well as get contact information for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation so you can check it out and make sure we are legit. 
Remember we will only be able to do the challenges from the TheAdventureChallenge.com website if we meet our funding milestones outlined above and on TheAdventureChallenge.com website. So by contributing to this campaign, you are not only funding a really cool technology that could change the world, but you will push me to raise money and awareness for a very worthwhile organization thru the Adventure Challenges. When we reach the $2,000,000 Goal, we will contribute $250,000 to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation, one of the largest single donations they have ever received.How will we use the Funds?Our Ultimate Goal is $2,000,000. We will use these fund as follows:1) Storage Capacity: For each TB of Cloud Storage, we require a minimum of 3TB for redundancy to keep your data safe and accessible 100% of the time.2) Server Hardware: We will need a massive amount of Server space. A minumium of 20 Fail-Over Server just for the main site at a minnimum, plus Cloud Storage Server, plus Bandwidth and server space. We plan to use a majority of the funds for this purpose. Capacity Planning is a major strategic goal for these funds.3) Reasearch, Development and Testing: We plan to have this Web-Based Operating System Accessible and Operational within 6 to 8 months, with tons of features for you to take advantage of.4) $250,000 will be Donated to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation. Individuals donating $100 or more will be given honorable mention on the website and a list will be made available to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation listing those giving $100 or more. Honorable mention will be given on our website for those giving $50 or more as well.PerksFor each $1 you gift to us, we will give you 1GB of cloud storage on the Frabjulous Platform for 2 years. Compare the savings to Google Drive (15 GB Free then $4.99/Month for 100GB). 115GB for 2 Years on Google Drive = $120 is ~$1.05/GB. You'd save ~$2.50/Year plus have all the extra benefits our Web-Based Operating System has to offer. If you only want to the Cloud Storage, donate the amount you want, even if it is more than $1, then choose the $1 Perk. We already understand that 1GB for every dollar you are donating. So if you donate $125, still select the $1 Perk if cloud storage is the only thing you desire, and we will give you 125GB of Cloud Storage.Personal Thank YouFor those giving $15, $25, or more we want to personally Thank You, but we can't travel around the coutry and the world to everyone's home to do it so we will do it with Technology. At $15 and above we will send a personal email Thanking You for your gift. At $25 and above, we will not only email a personal Thank You, but we will also send send you a link to a personalized video addressing you personally and giving you a heart felt and personalized Thank You as if we were face-to-face.The Adventure ChallengesThe Adventure Challenge is a series of increasingly difficult challenges that I will partake in as we meet milestones in our Crowd Funding. For each Adventure Challenge, we will film the Challenge in All-Digital Full-HD video, and we will publish the series exclusively on our Streaming Video Service which will be part of the Frabjulous Platform. For those giving a Gift of $50 or more but below $100, in addition to everything else mention, you will also get the Adventure Challenge Series on DVD, though, the Challenges where I will survive on an uninhabited, undeveloped tropical Island for either 21 or 48 days, complete Naked, you won't get to see the naughty parts. That will be blurred out. The Series on DVD will contain bonus footage not seen in the online version. If you contribute $100 or more you will get the Adventure Challenge Series on DVD, but now this is the fully uncensored version, showing all the naughty bits, with even more additional footage you won't see on the censored version of the DVD Series.For those who give $500 or more you get all the previous perks, plus your name will be listed as a honary donor when we donate $250,00 to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation. This list will be handed to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and your name will be listed on our site as an honorary contributor to the Frabjulous WebOS.",0.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p>Competitor designs require the tips to be correctly aligned inside the cable head which requires guidance to be connected correctly if missed. Competitor designs also use weaker magnets and require a very perfect alignment of the cable and tip for a correct connection. See if you can guess which is ASAP Connect (original version) below. </p>

<p>Don't be fooled by the similar external look of competitor magnetic cables, asap connect original version (on the right) will connect correctly even if the tip is flipped 180°, due to both the strong neodymium magnets having their polarity perfectly positioned and the unique outward and concave magnetic connector design. </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We've tested our cables on dozens of Apple and Android phone and tablet devices with no compatibility issues. As long as you have any device that requires a Lightning connector (such as iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus, iPad, iPad Mini etc.) a Micro USB connector (such as Android phones, mini speakers, headphones etc.) or a USB-C connector (such as Galaxy Note 7, Nexus 6P or OnePlus 2), asap X-Connect will work every time.  </span></p>
<p>asap X-Connect supports data transfer, however due to the LED light creating a max voltage barrier, fast charge technology including QualComm 2.0, QualComm 3.0 and Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge will charge about 5 - 10% slower from our initial testing. This is something we are looking to overcome in our development phase. Please note that as with all cables that are longer, there is more resistance in the wires and the charge speed will decrease as the length of the cable increases. </p>
<p><b>The best feature of asap X-Connect is it's cross-device compatibility. </b>This means you'll only need 1 cable for all phones and USB devices.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Through years of design and material testing, we've reduced the size of the ASAP Connect tip to only 10mm (0.39"") wide which fits perfectly into all your Apple and Android devices. We've tested the tips on over 100 phone cases and found it fit on all of them. The only exception is for some phone cases which have a protective flap on the charging port which may not be able to close properly with the tip in place. This also the case for the Samsung S5 phone due to its inbuilt protective flap. </span></p>

<p>We have evolved the traditional Lightning tip for Apple devices to create what we call the ""Alpha"" tip for 2 important reasons:</p>
<p>REASON 1: Have you ever had your Lightning tip start wobbling and eventually break off? This happens because the tip and base are made of 2 different components which break apart over repeated use. The Alpha tip solves this problem by integrating both the tip and base into 1 piece.</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/iSHnMYI.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">REASON 2: As Apple has not currently released their own magnetic Lightning tips, anyone seeking MFi (""Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad"") certification from Apple will be refused as they will need to purchase the tips from an Apple MFi certified magnetic Lightning tip manufacturer which does not currently exist as of September 2016.</span></p>
<p>Without MFi certification most major retailers will not sell a USB cable for Apple devices and leaves the brand potentially open to law suits from Apple. The integration of the Alpha tip bypasses this certification process by not using the Lightning tip and allowing ASAP Connect to be manufactured and sold in major retailers worldwide.</p>

<p>asap Technologies has recently been granted government funding that will ensure the development and production of what we hope to be the world's first USB-C magnetic tip. There have been significant challenges in this process as USB-C cables carry a higher electrical current (3.1Amps vs 2.4Amps) which also presents an array of safety concerns. </p>
<p>*UPDATE* USB-C tips have already been manufactured and started shipping as of March 2017.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>P</b></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>lease note: </b>We do not know the maximum output current achievable due to technological limitations. The true potential of USB-C is 5 Amps whilst the most advanced USB-C phones in the market currently only charge at a max of 3.1 Amps. A Type A to USB-C cable (Type A is the power input end of your regular wall adapter or laptop) may only be able to reach the max range of 2 - 2.4 Amps. We are currently researching into developing a USB-C to USB-C cable capable of reaching the full 5 Amps potential of USB-C which we will try to make backwards compatible with the current USB-C tip. We do not know if we are able to overcome the current limitations of magnetic technology which currently prevent charge speeds above 2.4Amps. </span></p>

<p>- Any company which claims to have Apple MFi certified lightning magnetic tips is completely false as of 8th September 2016.

Each asap X-Connect cable features 2x N52 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. For all you oldies who still think magnets will affect your phones function, mobile phones use SSD (solid state drives) which aren't affected by small magnets like ours. In fact your phone itself has over half a dozen magnets inside it to power features such as your speakers. The magnets will also have no impact on your GPS. We've clocked over 100 hours both driving and playing Pokemon Go (not whilst driving of course) and can verify this with personal experience.




When we mean 1 cable for all your phones, we mean it. We've designed 3 connectors to fit all 3 types of main connectors today for all mobile phones, tablets and USB devices.




Our cables feature a reversible magnetic connection which means instant connection every single time. Please note this is the asap connect original cable featured in the GIF below.
 

Sick and tired of flipping your cables back and forth to connect it on the right side? We were too, so we engineered asap X-Connect to have a reversible Type A (which is the side that inserts into your wall charger, laptop or power bank). We've evolved it from the older reversible Type A connector which moves back and forth and tends to break over time rather than stay stationary. This means first connection every time, no more fiddling around to connect your cable! 
asap X-Connect features a reversible Type A connector that we hope to see become a standard for all USB devices one day. Check it out in action below.

 

An often overlooked feature of magnetic cables is that it will protect your phone port from dust and dirt entering. By leaving the tip in there, it will also extend the life of your phone port from the normal wear and tear of cables being inserted and pulled out on a daily basis.


asap X-Connect's major design improvement over the original version is the stronger magnet. We've increased the magnet size from 1.9mm (0.07"") to 3mm (1.2"") for a magnetic connection that holds 33% more weight. 


The Alpha tip (for Apple devices) design has also been upgraded. With the first version we tested an incompatibility rate of 1 in 100. We've now reduced that to 4 in 1000 which is a far lower default rate than consumer electronics industry standards.




What truly sets ASAP Connect apart from other magnetic connectors is its unique bevelled and concave magnetic connector design on both the tip end and cable head end.
Through this careful 360° exterior positioning of 2 strong N52 grade neodymium magnets on both ends, the tip only needs to be within 38mm of the magnetic field of the cable tip to be quickly attracted and connect seamlessly. 
Competitor designs require the tips to be correctly aligned inside the cable head which requires guidance to be connected correctly if missed. Competitor designs also use weaker magnets and require a very perfect alignment of the cable and tip for a correct connection. See if you can guess which is ASAP Connect (original version) below. 

Don't be fooled by the similar external look of competitor magnetic cables, asap connect original version (on the right) will connect correctly even if the tip is flipped 180°, due to both the strong neodymium magnets having their polarity perfectly positioned and the unique outward and concave magnetic connector design. 
asap X-Connect has upgraded the magnetic connection to be 33% stronger with the ability to connect from a distance of 38mm (1.5""), up from the original asap connect's 28mm (1.1"").  See the comparison below.


asap X-Connect features the world's strongest commercially available magnets known as N52 grade magnets. When we say we're using the world's strongest magnets, we mean it! Enough with the technical blah blah, how strong you might ask? Strong enough to hold an iPad Air which is 437g (0.96lb)!








You will be emailed a survey from Backerkit 14 days after your purchase, asking you to choose your options, purchase additional add-ons including tips, adapters, cables, sets and update your shipping address. Any new purchases from the Backerkit survey will not have an extra shipping charge and you will be offered the discounted rate per add on if you purchased a special or volume perk. You will have 14 business days to complete your survey from the day you receive it. If you have any questions after the survey has arrived please email hello@chargeasap.com.

We've tested our cables on dozens of Apple and Android phone and tablet devices with no compatibility issues. As long as you have any device that requires a Lightning connector (such as iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus, iPad, iPad Mini etc.) a Micro USB connector (such as Android phones, mini speakers, headphones etc.) or a USB-C connector (such as Galaxy Note 7, Nexus 6P or OnePlus 2), asap X-Connect will work every time.  
asap X-Connect supports data transfer, however due to the LED light creating a max voltage barrier, fast charge technology including QualComm 2.0, QualComm 3.0 and Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge will charge about 5 - 10% slower from our initial testing. This is something we are looking to overcome in our development phase. Please note that as with all cables that are longer, there is more resistance in the wires and the charge speed will decrease as the length of the cable increases. 
The best feature of asap X-Connect is it's cross-device compatibility. This means you'll only need 1 cable for all phones and USB devices.
Through years of design and material testing, we've reduced the size of the ASAP Connect tip to only 10mm (0.39"") wide which fits perfectly into all your Apple and Android devices. We've tested the tips on over 100 phone cases and found it fit on all of them. The only exception is for some phone cases which have a protective flap on the charging port which may not be able to close properly with the tip in place. This also the case for the Samsung S5 phone due to its inbuilt protective flap. 
  
We've tested asap X-Connect to work on a variety of popular cases. The most popular question we received is if our cables are compatible with the Lifeproof Fre case for iPhone 6/6s. Here's a video below showing the compatibility.






 
 

We have evolved the traditional Lightning tip for Apple devices to create what we call the ""Alpha"" tip for 2 important reasons:
REASON 1: Have you ever had your Lightning tip start wobbling and eventually break off? This happens because the tip and base are made of 2 different components which break apart over repeated use. The Alpha tip solves this problem by integrating both the tip and base into 1 piece.



REASON 2: As Apple has not currently released their own magnetic Lightning tips, anyone seeking MFi (""Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad"") certification from Apple will be refused as they will need to purchase the tips from an Apple MFi certified magnetic Lightning tip manufacturer which does not currently exist as of September 2016.
Without MFi certification most major retailers will not sell a USB cable for Apple devices and leaves the brand potentially open to law suits from Apple. The integration of the Alpha tip bypasses this certification process by not using the Lightning tip and allowing ASAP Connect to be manufactured and sold in major retailers worldwide.

 

asap Technologies has recently been granted government funding that will ensure the development and production of what we hope to be the world's first USB-C magnetic tip. There have been significant challenges in this process as USB-C cables carry a higher electrical current (3.1Amps vs 2.4Amps) which also presents an array of safety concerns. 
*UPDATE* USB-C tips have already been manufactured and started shipping as of March 2017.
 
Please note: We do not know the maximum output current achievable due to technological limitations. The true potential of USB-C is 5 Amps whilst the most advanced USB-C phones in the market currently only charge at a max of 3.1 Amps. A Type A to USB-C cable (Type A is the power input end of your regular wall adapter or laptop) may only be able to reach the max range of 2 - 2.4 Amps. We are currently researching into developing a USB-C to USB-C cable capable of reaching the full 5 Amps potential of USB-C which we will try to make backwards compatible with the current USB-C tip. We do not know if we are able to overcome the current limitations of magnetic technology which currently prevent charge speeds above 2.4Amps. 
 

Over the past 2 years we have been working closely with our manufacturer and possess both a registered design and utility patent-pending to protect our unique technology and its potential future applications. For further information regarding this please contact us via email on hello@chargeasap.com.
asap X-Connect has also been granted the following international certifications:

Beware of imitations, fake and low quality magnetic cables on the Internet. We have purchased samples directly off dozens of suppliers who claim to produce premium magnetic USB cables and performed both extensive laboratory and daily-use testing.
Here are our findings:
-  We have found many to not work as claimed, not be reversible, not transfer data nor charge your phone as it's maximum speed. We have even found some to create smoke and even damage your phone
- Many of these companies offer cables that do not have the following international certifications: FCC, CE, ROHS and hence may not be approved for sale in your country. You should always ask the seller first if they have these international certifications before making a purchase
- Any company which claims to have Apple MFi certified lightning magnetic tips is completely false as of 8th September 2016. Apple has not currently produced nor approved any magnetic Lightning tips commercially and hence will not provide a MFi licenced magnetic Lighting connector to any company attempting to selling magnetic connectors as of 8th September 2016
- We have found many companies to use poor quality magnets that have weak magnetism or lose their connectivity over time due to no magnetic plating
- We have found many companies produce tip designs that are too bulky to fit most phone cases
