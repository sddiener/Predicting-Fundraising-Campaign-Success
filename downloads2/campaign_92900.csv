<p>One of the biggest parts of my transition is to have top surgery which means to reconstruct my chest to have a male appearance.

<p><strong>A quest to document the endangered and disappearing scenic skylines of historic, rural Utah.</strong></p> <p>My name is Robert Stevens. I am an award-winning journalist and photographer living and working in Utah. I am also an FAA-licensed unmanned aircraft pilot.</p>
<p>My goal with this crowdfunding campaign is to facilitate the use of my experience as a drone pilot, photographer and journalist to document aerial-perspective photographs of historic, rural Utah for posterity.</p>
<p>As managing editor of award-winning Utah weekly newspaper, <i>The Sanpete Messenger</i>, I became aware of how rapidly Utah is developing—with factories and big housing developments popping up all over the state. Even Silicone Valley is now facing competition from the progress of Utah's ""Silicone Slopes.""</p>
<p>Right here in the very rural Sanpete County, with its farms and tiny little towns and cities, the impact of development on the landscape when viewed from above is evident.</p>
<p>Drones provided me access to an elevated perspective most people don’t have. It became obvious to me that the beautiful and historic landscapes in rural Utah will become spotted, then dense with development in just a few short years.</p>
<p>I have made it my goal as a professional in the fields of journalism, photography, and unmanned aircraft to capture <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> the essence of rural Utah from a soaring, elevated perspective in sharp, vibrant photographs before it’s too late.</span></p>
<p>The reason I am turning to crowdfunding for help with this project is simple—I want to do it right!</p>
<p>I need to rent the best aerial optics and equipment I can obtain, take the time to capture, develop and curate the collection of images to be the best they can be, and then print them to be appreciated when the beautiful patches of earth they depict have long since been developed. </p>
<p>I need to do it justice.</p>
<p>If Utah continues to prosper and grow—like I know it will—someday these beautiful landscapes will vanish forever, so please help me accomplish my goal of preserving them through a combination of time-honored methods and cutting-edge aerial photographic technology.</p>
<p>The project will focus on the epic scenery that is still abundant in the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area. This stretch of land along the U.S. 89 corridor remains one of the most beautiful and historic places in the state. Historic monuments like the Manti Temple dot the landscape. Equally beautiful and endangered subjects like small town culture, agriculture and heritage livestock culture also make the area a hotbed of beauty...For now.</p>
<p>To get together a collection worthy of its purpose, I estimate my costs will be around $3,000, so I have set my goal to that amount. If I raise more than $3,000, it will mean I can document more beauty, and in higher quality.</p>
<p>If you contribute $20 or more to the campaign, you will be listed as a contributor in the free-for-all online gallery that I will make the collection available through. If you contribute $50 or more, you will get a hi-res digital image of your choice from the collection. If you contribute $100 or more, you will get a signed and numbered 11""x14"" print of your choice from a curated list of collection highlights.</p>
<p>Besides the free online gallery, it is my hope that the collection can be made into a hardbound book. All contributors towards the campaign will receive a 10% discount off the final sale price of the book.</p>
<p>There will be challenges (inclement weather, potential equipment malfunctions, etc.), but if you help make this project happen, I give you my word that I will use every ounce of my skills and all my training and practice as a professional photojournalist and commercial unmanned aircraft pilot, along with the most professional equipment possible, to make this a beautiful aerial photojournalism collection worthy of appreciating for generations to come.</p>

<h3>Long Term Goals &amp; What Photography Means to Me</h3>
<p>I have a few goals that I'm working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having proper functional equipment to provide top notch service.</li>
<li>Having printed materials to offer like calendars, cards, books etc...</li>
<li>Open a studio</li>
</ul>
<p>Photography has always been a part of me and my life. It's an escape for me but I also love giving people photos they can be proud of and cherish for generations. There is nothing better to see a bride or high school senior who gets their photos and says, ""I never knew I could look that good."" I love all aspects and each has their own value to us and our history.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Immediate Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what I really need now:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to replace some broken equipment. Specifically important lenses.</li>
<li>Building stock so that I can easily and quickly sell and ship merchandise</li>
<li>Advertising Funds</li>
<li>Perks will be my art, discounted or free photography sessions and a 101 class.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Investing in local art and community is so important:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world needs more art and supporting local businesses helps drive a healthy economy.</li>
<li>I'd like to get to a place where I can donate my time and art to other causes like homeless outreach. Everyone deserves to have a picture of themselves they can be proud of. Giving back to my community is very important to me.</li>
<li>Documenting people, places and things is important to our history. Portraits of people, landscape photos, lifestyle and street photography all serve a function to the documentation of our culture and history. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Nothing is ever without risk. The one thing is that people will always want pictures of themselves. Investing in photography is pretty simple but important. </p>
<ul><li>The biggest struggle is keeping up with a saturated market. That said, I'm a driven individual who keeps up with latest techniques, styles and trends to make sure I'm able to offer the best product I can.</li></ul>

<h3>Campaign and Background</h3>
<p>I'm so glad that our paths have crossed, and to have found you here on my campaign. I'm on the verge of following my dreams, but am reluctant to break the bank. I could try my luck with my business line of credit, but I wanted to offer everyone the opportunity to be a part of this journey with me.</p>
<p>I created a DBA in 2018 after casually taking photos for a few years. Things have been going slow for me creatively as I focus on my day job. I have a backlog of so many great images that I would like to see printed, and which I believe other people want to view. If this campaign goes well, I will be able to develop my online print store for my website: <a href=""http://www.f10.media/shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.f10.media</a>.</p>
<p>I have a larger goal in mind to someday buy my own printer someday. I'm hoping this launch will get me into a position to buy one with the profits which I see from everyone's help here.</p>
<p>I have goals and a vision, but cannot get there without your help! Thank you so much for considering.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I need your help, and I want to say Thank You</h3>
<p>I am partial to larger sized prints, and exploring different materials. I think the images I capture demand a large medium - to stand, to stare. I know Wrapped Canvas prints are economical for the size, so I will probably start there. I would like to get at least 10 prints made, each will be over $100 each.</p>
<p>I am adamant about thanking everyone who helps me reach my goal. Find my IG handle in the FAQ :)</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will use whatever I do receive to amplify my online store, or hopefully make at least one print.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Aside from my online shop, I have an art show coming up where I will hang some prints in my friend's studio/salon. I currently have 4 ""show prints"" which I don't sell, and are a little banged up. They look fine hung on the wall, and I will use those for the show. However, I would like to hang more than 4 prints.</p>
<p>This project holds great value to me as I strive to become a full-time photographer. It is almost impossible to get ahead at the moment, trying to save up to invest in my business while also making ends meet in my everyday life.</p>
<p>I would not know how to begin to thank you for your contribution. It would mean so, so much. Contributors who make back this campaign with at least $25 will be offered a virtual hangout where I can express my utmost appreciation for you :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, my DBA has a business account at the bank where I could use my credit to invest in making large format prints. While the reward of selling prints is worth the risk, I am just not in a position to do this right now. I'm not sure how long it would take me to save up enough of what's left over from my paychecks to create an online shop.</p>
<p>I believe my images hold such beauty that clients/customers would love to hang them, and continue viewing them past a show, or in real life. I have great confidence in my ability to be a photographer, it is just so economically difficult for me to fully dive into at the moment.</p>
<p>If this campaign doesn't take off, or if I receive $0, I will continue to explore ways to develop an online store for my prints. I will not rest until my art is printed and hung all around the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have made it this far in my message, I thank you greatly. If you are unable to contribute I would still be so grateful if you shared my campaign within your circles. Perhaps your family and friends and colleagues are able to help, and I can thank you all for your part in helping me make my dreams a reality.</p>

<p>We pursue natural aesthetics, which focuses on the stories in your journey instead of the composition of the picture; it is surrounded by ambiguity and randomness instead of perfection.

</h3> <p></p>I'm a full-time freelance commercial, editorial, and fine art photographer and instructor. I also have a degree in wildlife biology and a former career as a wildlife biologist. <br/><br/>I'm going to Scotland in July/August. I'll be exploring over a 14-day period and my mode of travel and accommodation will be an 
RV/motorhome. I'll be able to travel to and stay right at or very near 
the locations and trail heads where I'll be photographing. This will 
give me a more engaged and immersive experience with greater time and 
opportunity to make photographs at each location. Here's the map of the 
general route and set of locations I plan to visit.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1353230/files/20150403145651-route-1.jpg?1428098211"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>Some locations:</b> Loch Sligachan, Elgol, the Quiraing, Old Man of 
Storr, Glen Brittle, Isle of Raasay, Buchaille Etive Mor, Rannoch Moor, 
Neist Point, Oban, Kilchurn Castle, Stalker Castle, Eilean Donan Castle,
 Inveraray Castle, Talisker Bay, Loch Slapin.<br/><br/>A goal of this project is to create a book, a photo book; <b>Scotland : Senses &amp; Perception</b>. However, not
 simply a book of beautiful photographs, but also about how our senses and perceptions influence the way we view and 
interpret the world around us through our art - what and how we photograph (or paint, or write, or sculpt). A book of art with a bit of philosophy and science; delving into some of the <i>why </i>of photography, instead of the <i>how</i>. There is a fair amount of science and philosophy behind this 
concept which I've been pursuing rigorously for about 4 years now and 
for a bunch of years prior to that, inspired and influenced by my 
biology/ecology background, my personal interest in human perception, 
and my love of passing on that information to others. <br/><br/>Vision is a dynamic process involving more than just our eyes, and photography is more than just taking pictures. This will be 
described in the book and in the information about each photograph, 
along with some useful exercises you can do yourself to ""rediscover the 
art of seeing"". <br/><br/>I chose Scotland for this project, specifically the Isle of Skye and 
Glencoe region,  because the environment lends itself to a wide range of
 sensory exploration in a relatively small area. Its unspoiled landscape
 showcases the raw power and beauty of nature. Changing weather 
conditions create amazing atmospheric light amongst majestic crags, 
rounded hills, grand valleys, rocky coast, boggy moors, rushing rivers, 
and serene lochs. It's not difficult to imagine giants roaming the 
hills, dragons soaring in the sky, and fairies flitting about in the 
woods and around crystal clear pools.<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Details<br/>
</h3> <p>All the reservations and expenses of the trip are arranged and paid for. The funding I'm requesting is to create the book and prints, get them printed, and distributed to supporters. <br/></p>
<p>I'll have three versions of the book, an ebook, an 8x10 signed softcover book, and an 8x10 signed and numbered limited edition (150) hardcover book. It'll be 80 - 120 pages. Other perks are signed prints, handwritten postcards sent from Scotland, and a 3-day Senses &amp; Perception workshop with me in the Alvord Desert of southcentral Oregon in June, 2015.<br/></p>
<p>The first section of the book will be a description of the sensory
 and perceptual apparatus of the human body, the relationships and 
interactions between them, and how they influence the process of making a
 photograph.</p>
<p>The main section and bulk of the book will be a gallery of photographs 
showcasing the landscape and character of the Isle of Skye and the 
Scottish Highlands. I'll be making photographs ranging from grand 
landscapes to intimate close-ups and long exposures using 35mm DSLR, 
Polaroid and smartphone cameras. Each photograph will be accompanied by a description of the sensory and perceptual impressions 
influencing my selection of the subject, composition, and camera 
settings. The technical stats for each photo will be included. Image 
descriptions and stats will likely be placed in an appendix to maintain a
 clean look. </p>
<p>A final acknowledgment section will be the list of all you great and generous contributors to this project. </p>

If, by chance, the full funding goal is not reached, I will still fulfill the perk levels that were funded, so nobody will be left out. As I mentioned, I'm going anyway but thought this would be a great way to get people involved in the project and will be the most cost-effective way for you as a supporter of this project to receive the perks, especially the book and the 3-day workshop.<br/> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Addendum - what else is in it for you?<br/>
</h3> <p>Most description, explanation, teaching, criticism, technique, and presentation of visual art is...well...heavily biased toward the 'visual' side of our sensory and perceptual being. What if you better understood how to rediscover the art of seeing by using more than just your eyes? How beneficial would that be to your photography and your own exploration of your world?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the book, prints, and other perks, I plan to exhibit
 20 printed photographs from the book during the Month of 
Photography-Boise (MoPBOI) in March/April, 2016. I began MoPBOI in 2013,
 following the pattern of the Month of Photography-LA (MOPLA), to 
showcase all aspects of photography from commercial to alternative and 
historic processes in all genres by Idaho photographers.</p>
<p>Blog 
posts throughout the trip will keep you informed on progress, give you a
 sneak peak to some of the images I'm making, and insight into traveling
 by RV in Scotland. I might even make an ebook of the RV experience, 
with travel tips and recipes as a special thank you.</p>If the goal is surpassed, I will increase the number of pages for the book and/or select higher quality paper, depending on how far over the line it goes.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I'm an experienced traveler. I've traveled to and spent time in Africa, New Zealand, Australia, South
 America, Central America, and across North America. I've taught 
photography classes and led workshops since 1998 and love to teach and 
help others grow in the art of photography and art awareness in general. <br/></p>
<p>But there can be unforeseen circumstances 
on an expedition like this, such as airline delays, baggage loss, road 
and access closures, car breakdowns and accidents, theft of equipment, 
etc. I will be carrying critical camera equipment with me at all times 
when traveling by air, and covered by insurance in case of major issues.
 Any travel delays should be minimal. I'm in good physical condition and
 don't put myself in unreasonable or dangerous situations (on purpose).<br/></p>
<p>Weather is always a major player when working with nature. In Scotland, 
weather provides the character and mood of the land. I'm prepared to 
work in any weather conditions I encounter and actually look forward to a
 variety of weather. The more varied the weather the more sensory and 
perceptual experiences I will have and be able to incorporate into the 
photographs and descriptions.<br/> </p>
<p>Shipping of rewards will begin once the funding deadline has passed, 
beginning with thank you notes. Other rewards will be shipped while I'm 
in Scotland and after my return as they are completed. The production of
 the book is planned to take roughly 120 days from the time I return to 
the first ship date, given no major events intervene. However, if any 
significant delay occurs, backers will be notified and kept up-to-date 
on progress.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you aren't able to help fund this project, I understand. I'd love to support all the projects and causes that interest me, but I have to eat, just like you do. <br/></p>
<p>But, you can be a big force in the success of this project by getting the word out to your friends and social circles. Use the share tools, copy and paste the project URL into your tweets, Facebook and G+ posts, LinkedIn messages, wherever you're connected. </p>
<p>Even if you do fund it, I encourage you to pass it on. <br/></p>
<p>I really do appreciate your support and I'm grateful you choose to help fund this project and/or promote it.<br/></p>

 Inveraray Castle, Talisker Bay, Loch Slapin.A goal of this project is to create a book, a photo book; Scotland : Senses & Perception. However, not
 simply a book of beautiful photographs, but also about how our senses and perceptions influence the way we view and 
interpret the world around us through our art - what and how we photograph (or paint, or write, or sculpt). A book of art with a bit of philosophy and science; delving into some of the why of photography, instead of the how. There is a fair amount of science and philosophy behind this 
concept which I've been pursuing rigorously for about 4 years now and 
for a bunch of years prior to that, inspired and influenced by my 
biology/ecology background, my personal interest in human perception, 
and my love of passing on that information to others. Vision is a dynamic process involving more than just our eyes, and photography is more than just taking pictures. This will be 
described in the book and in the information about each photograph, 
along with some useful exercises you can do yourself to ""rediscover the 
art of seeing"". I chose Scotland for this project, specifically the Isle of Skye and 
Glencoe region,  because the environment lends itself to a wide range of
 sensory exploration in a relatively small area. Its unspoiled landscape
 showcases the raw power and beauty of nature. Changing weather 
conditions create amazing atmospheric light amongst majestic crags, 
rounded hills, grand valleys, rocky coast, boggy moors, rushing rivers, 
and serene lochs. It's not difficult to imagine giants roaming the 
hills, dragons soaring in the sky, and fairies flitting about in the 
woods and around crystal clear pools.   The Details
 All the reservations and expenses of the trip are arranged and paid for. The funding I'm requesting is to create the book and prints, get them printed, and distributed to supporters. 
I'll have three versions of the book, an ebook, an 8x10 signed softcover book, and an 8x10 signed and numbered limited edition (150) hardcover book. It'll be 80 - 120 pages. Other perks are signed prints, handwritten postcards sent from Scotland, and a 3-day Senses & Perception workshop with me in the Alvord Desert of southcentral Oregon in June, 2015.
The first section of the book will be a description of the sensory
 and perceptual apparatus of the human body, the relationships and 
interactions between them, and how they influence the process of making a
 photograph.
The main section and bulk of the book will be a gallery of photographs 
showcasing the landscape and character of the Isle of Skye and the 
Scottish Highlands. I'll be making photographs ranging from grand 
landscapes to intimate close-ups and long exposures using 35mm DSLR, 
Polaroid and smartphone cameras. Each photograph will be accompanied by a description of the sensory and perceptual impressions 
influencing my selection of the subject, composition, and camera 
settings. The technical stats for each photo will be included. Image 
descriptions and stats will likely be placed in an appendix to maintain a
 clean look. 
A final acknowledgment section will be the list of all you great and generous contributors to this project. 


Book Details

Photographs & text by Mike Shipman
Hardcover & softcover editions 8"" x 10""
80 pages (120+ potential if funding goal is exceeded)

paper 100# (148GSM) premium matte

Release date December 2015Here are some examples of my work and in the slideshow at the top of the page and gallery to give you a sense of 
the style of photography you're likely to see in the book.





I will make the book, regardless of funding. If, by chance, the full funding goal is not reached, I will still fulfill the perk levels that were funded, so nobody will be left out. As I mentioned, I'm going anyway but thought this would be a great way to get people involved in the project and will be the most cost-effective way for you as a supporter of this project to receive the perks, especially the book and the 3-day workshop.    Addendum - what else is in it for you?
 Most description, explanation, teaching, criticism, technique, and presentation of visual art is...well...heavily biased toward the 'visual' side of our sensory and perceptual being. What if you better understood how to rediscover the art of seeing by using more than just your eyes? How beneficial would that be to your photography and your own exploration of your world?

In addition to the book, prints, and other perks, I plan to exhibit
 20 printed photographs from the book during the Month of 
Photography-Boise (MoPBOI) in March/April, 2016. I began MoPBOI in 2013,
 following the pattern of the Month of Photography-LA (MOPLA), to 
showcase all aspects of photography from commercial to alternative and 
historic processes in all genres by Idaho photographers.
Blog 
posts throughout the trip will keep you informed on progress, give you a
 sneak peak to some of the images I'm making, and insight into traveling
 by RV in Scotland. I might even make an ebook of the RV experience, 
with travel tips and recipes as a special thank you.If the goal is surpassed, I will increase the number of pages for the book and/or select higher quality paper, depending on how far over the line it goes.
  Risks & Challenges I'm an experienced traveler. I've traveled to and spent time in Africa, New Zealand, Australia, South
 America, Central America, and across North America. I've taught 
photography classes and led workshops since 1998 and love to teach and 
help others grow in the art of photography and art awareness in general. 
But there can be unforeseen circumstances 
on an expedition like this, such as airline delays, baggage loss, road 
and access closures, car breakdowns and accidents, theft of equipment, 
etc. I will be carrying critical camera equipment with me at all times 
when traveling by air, and covered by insurance in case of major issues.
 Any travel delays should be minimal. I'm in good physical condition and
 don't put myself in unreasonable or dangerous situations (on purpose).
Weather is always a major player when working with nature. In Scotland, 
weather provides the character and mood of the land. I'm prepared to 
work in any weather conditions I encounter and actually look forward to a
 variety of weather. The more varied the weather the more sensory and 
perceptual experiences I will have and be able to incorporate into the 
photographs and descriptions. 
Shipping of rewards will begin once the funding deadline has passed, 
beginning with thank you notes. Other rewards will be shipped while I'm 
in Scotland and after my return as they are completed. The production of
 the book is planned to take roughly 120 days from the time I return to 
the first ship date, given no major events intervene. However, if any 
significant delay occurs, backers will be notified and kept up-to-date 
on progress.
  Other Ways You Can Help If you aren't able to help fund this project, I understand. I'd love to support all the projects and causes that interest me, but I have to eat, just like you do. 
But, you can be a big force in the success of this project by getting the word out to your friends and social circles. Use the share tools, copy and paste the project URL into your tweets, Facebook and G+ posts, LinkedIn messages, wherever you're connected. 
Even if you do fund it, I encourage you to pass it on. 
I really do appreciate your support and I'm grateful you choose to help fund this project and/or promote it.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>INSIDE THE EXHIBITION<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>When one enters the WZF exhibition, the visitor will immediately be overtaken by the ambiance created by the multi platform gallery presentation. The <b>photography </b>and <b>videography</b> gallery is where the audience can take the journey alongside the journalists by viewing images from remote battlefields throughout the Middle East while looking over <b>personal items</b> in display-cases used by the freelancers in the field that made reporting these stories possible. Items that each journalist find significant in their reporting along with other pieces of their stories that were obtained while reporting, including battle flags, uniforms, and other conflict-related artifacts. The viewers' mood is heightened by audio of war zone radio reporting that will play throughout the photo and video gallery. </p>
<p>Connecting the photography and videography gallery to the interactive memorial will be a section dedicated to <b>local freelancers</b> who risk all in helping international media workers produce stories for global media outlets. With the use of their own media work and filmed interviews these talented individuals will share their personal stories of reporting on frontlines in their own countries and the life threatening hassles of freelancing as a local journalist. </p>
<p>The final section of the exhibition will be a place to embrace the information obtained throughout the exhibit and witness the heavy costs of freelancing in war zones, by viewing WZF's <b>memorial wall </b>dedicated to freelance journalists killed or missing while covering conflicts in the Middle East during the last several years. <span><br/></span>The memorial will specifically highlight the local freelance photojournalist Molhem Barakat who was killed in Syria while covering battles in Aleppo. The memorial will be interactive with a message book for visitors that will be sent to the family of the fallen journalist, along with items for sale that raise awareness to the costs of reporting inside war zones.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

<h3>FREELANCERS IN DANGER <br/>
</h3>During the past several years, threats towards journalists, especially those working in conflict areas in the Middle East, has increased drastically. Sixty-one journalists have been killed for reasons related to their work or have died while on assignment so far in 2015.<br/>This year is expected to be the <a href=""http://www.freemedia.at/newssview/article/2015-threatens-to-end-as-deadliest-year-on-record.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deadliest year </a>ever for journalists. Freelancers with limited means, little backing from media companies, and often working alone in the field are further exposed to danger and account to the high number of deaths.<br/>

The War Zone Freelance Exhibition gives an exclusive look into the work and world of freelance journalists covering wars and conflicts in the Middle East.Your donation to the War Zone Freelance Exhibition supports the exposure of freelance journalists dedicated to covering conflicts worldwide and contributes to educating the global public on where much of today's news comes from and the stories behind the freelancers in the field risking their lives reporting it.


The project is motivated
by the desire to pay tribute and provoke debate on the important and consequential role freelance journalists play in bringing news out of conflict areas to the international public, often with little support, on their own expense and at extremely high risk.




The War Zone Freelance Exhibition 2016 is scheduled to begin in London at the Frontline Club on January 28th and from this legendary venue, the team has planned a six month tour to gallery locations in major European cities including Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Barcelona. 
The War Zone Freelance Exhibition was founded in July 2015 and has since been published in various media and received great feedback from the Committee to Protect Journalists, Frontline Freelance Register, and other major journalist organizations from around the world. All of them are on board to share the WZF message and give informational and network support, however none have committed financially. 
Since the beginning, the War Zone Freelance Team has been self-financing their project and cannot continue without outside support.  


CREATORS
The War Zone Freelance Exhibition is made up by a team of international freelance journalists. 

American photojournalist Osie Greenway, Danish writer/ reporter Anne Alling, German writer/ photographer Benjamin Hiller, and Dutch videographer/
photographer Jeffry Ruigendijk have all spent considerable amounts of time in the last several years covering conflicts and humanitarian issues in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, among others. With both published and unseen material from war zones throughout the Middle East they propose a multi-faceted exhibition that will pull its audience deep into the reporting process and educate on both people affected by war in the region and the
struggles and triumphs of working independently as a freelancer in a high-stakes vocation.





INSIDE THE EXHIBITION






When one enters the WZF exhibition, the visitor will immediately be overtaken by the ambiance created by the multi platform gallery presentation. The photography and videography gallery is where the audience can take the journey alongside the journalists by viewing images from remote battlefields throughout the Middle East while looking over personal items in display-cases used by the freelancers in the field that made reporting these stories possible. Items that each journalist find significant in their reporting along with other pieces of their stories that were obtained while reporting, including battle flags, uniforms, and other conflict-related artifacts. The viewers' mood is heightened by audio of war zone radio reporting that will play throughout the photo and video gallery. 
Connecting the photography and videography gallery to the interactive memorial will be a section dedicated to local freelancers who risk all in helping international media workers produce stories for global media outlets. With the use of their own media work and filmed interviews these talented individuals will share their personal stories of reporting on frontlines in their own countries and the life threatening hassles of freelancing as a local journalist. 
The final section of the exhibition will be a place to embrace the information obtained throughout the exhibit and witness the heavy costs of freelancing in war zones, by viewing WZF's memorial wall dedicated to freelance journalists killed or missing while covering conflicts in the Middle East during the last several years. The memorial will specifically highlight the local freelance photojournalist Molhem Barakat who was killed in Syria while covering battles in Aleppo. The memorial will be interactive with a message book for visitors that will be sent to the family of the fallen journalist, along with items for sale that raise awareness to the costs of reporting inside war zones. 





FREELANCERS IN DANGER 
During the past several years, threats towards journalists, especially those working in conflict areas in the Middle East, has increased drastically. Sixty-one journalists have been killed for reasons related to their work or have died while on assignment so far in 2015.This year is expected to be the deadliest year ever for journalists. Freelancers with limited means, little backing from media companies, and often working alone in the field are further exposed to danger and account to the high number of deaths.




Syrian freelance photographer in his late teens Molhem Barakat was killed on December 20th 2013 while covering a battle at al-Kindi Hospital in Aleppo, Syria. Since May that year, he had been freelancing for Reuters who distributed dozens of his pictures around the world, some of them appearing in prestigious publications such as The New Yorker and The New York Times. 
Selected photos from Molhem's portfolio will be displayed in the WZF interactive memorial along with the cameras he carried the day he was killed. 
“Journalism was his whole life, it was his message to present real and honest photos. I ask you that you display his cameras in the exhibition so that the whole world can see it. My son’s blood is on those cameras”, Molhem’s mother writes to WZF about her son’s story being told at the War Zone Freelance Exhibition.




EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE









Many exhibitions fail to tell the story behind the story of what it is 
like for journalists working in
dangerous places. The WZF Exhibition will serve as a tool to educate on 
the profession of freelance journalism. The mobile exhibit is an ideal place for journalism students and media 
majors to learn about the freelance profession, a field that is often 
left out of college and university journalism curriculum.  
In each city we exhibit in, our goal is to highlight a local freelance journalist that has covered conflicts in the Mideast by sharing his/ her work and their experiences. The WZF journalists 
themselves will give lectures and hold Q&As
to talk about their experiences and the impact of current conflicts in the Middle East.

In addition to highlighting local international journalist the freelancers and fixers from Iraq, Syria, and the Kurdistan region, who's work is displayed in the exhibition will come to elaborate in an open discussion forum on the challenges of covering war and conflicts as a freelance journalist in their home country.  
Speakers from international journalism organizations will attend for lectures to give statistical information and share their insight on the current state of freelance journalism.







FUTURE GOALS










After touring the Middle East exhibition for a six
month period to major cities in Europe the WZF team hopes to purpose a second six month
tour through North America starting in New York City and ending in Toronto
where the exhibition media will be sold to raise money for CJFE's
Journalists in Distress Fund.

Dakota ITINERARY is an artistic and documentary collaborative project I started in Tunisia.  Its basis is a painted canvas backdrop against which a person poses with their favorite possessions.  What results from the photographs and films is an exploration of identity and memory that joins the subject's expressive need with the photographer's ability to manifest.  In this way, both the photographer and the subject become collaborators on a journey of discovery.For this project, I would like to return to the homes and reservations of the Sioux, whom I met, admired, and briefly photographed and filmed on a previous trip, to continue this journey of exploration.  Who I Am / The Genesis My name is Faten Gaddes.  I am a French Tunisian artist who has been working as a photographer since 1998. In 2011 in the throes of the Jasmine Revolution, a dictatorship of 50 years was overthrown in Tunisia.  At that time, my installation Punching Ball – an artwork intended to denounce violence against women – was burnt publicly by religious extremists who also posted my name and address in newspapers – a potential death sentence. I withdrew from making art, isolated and depressed. Punching Ball dismantled and burnt publicly by Extremists. One day going through a garage at my home, I discovered an old backdrop – a large ""trompe l'oeil"" scene painted on canvas in misty hues of flowers and sky.  Something about this backdrop evoked not only a calmness in me but, even more strongly, an idea and a determination to seek out ways to use my art to reclaim and express identity.Although I eventually left Tunisia, I can proudly say Tunisia gains momentum each and every day, advancing in the path of democratization.  In 2015, Tunisia was awarded the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet for ""its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution of 2011"". @Faten_Gaddes  Where My Project is Today For the next eight years after finding the backdrop, I traveled through North Africa , Europe and the United States, where I met my subjects while on the road.  Due to personal history, as a woman and as a committed artist, my interest and compassion for working with minorities was born.  I, too, was seeking my place in the world, despite marginalization.  The relationships I made are unforgettable and humbling.When I arrived in the United States, I wanted to continue Itinerary by documenting the country's first inhabitants.  While I was well aware of the horrific treatment of Native Americans before my project, this was the first time I was able to follow my intentions of documenting this repression in such a developed country.It was in New York that I first encountered Native Americans in my life.  They had migrated to the city for work and were far from friends and family who remained on the reservations. I sympathized with this and began to trace stories back to sacred lands. Route in S. Dakota In 2018, I borrowed a friend's van for a month and a half and drove through South Dakota with my backdrop to where the Sioux tribe lives.  Despite being depressed about the living conditions that mainstream media fails to cover, I had an exceptional human experience.  There, I experienced the same level of solidarity I had during the entire making of Itinerary.  I sometimes forgot I had come with a purpose while engaging and becoming friends with the people I met.When I asked my Sioux friends about bringing a filmmaker to capture stories, I was thrilled to be met with collaboration.  Together, we have come up with a list of contacts and an ""itinerary"" of reservations to visit.Although sacred lands are preserved for future generations to live on, Natives often have covered their cultural identities to weave into other social fabrics.  As a tribute, I want the latest chapter of Itinerary to be as authentic as possible, beyond what just a camera can do.  I will need to expand this project into one that will tell several personal stories. Michele's house, Wanblee, Pine Ridge Reservation, S. Dakota ""Her recent work to encapsulate the character, faces, and stories of Native Americans in portraiture is of outstanding quality and comparable to Edward Curtis of the late 1880's within America. The ability to depict the sentient rendering of Native peoples' faces to the two-dimensional plane that she captures takes exceptional skill and aptitude to apprehend. While numerous artists in mediums such as painting, charcoal, pencil, and photography have attempted to denote the mystique within Native American omnipresence, Ms. Gaddes is doing so and needs to continue her work within the Americas.""- Ben Rhodd, Potawatomi & Lakota Tribes, Archaeologist  Why I Need Your Help I want to return to the Sioux reservations and more extensively share the stories of the people who despite great injustice, repression, and difficult living conditions still believe profoundly in the generosity of human nature, and respect for the land. With your support I want to collaborate with the Sioux and other Native Americans in telling their stories. I want to reveal their resilience in the face of hardship, share their wisdom carved from experience and memory, and provide them the opportunity to express and celebrate their cultural identity.   The resulting photographs and films, I believe, will be of great importance in gaining recognition for their lives and traditions, and hopefully will help bridge the divide that has diminished their culture so as to lead to understanding and appreciation.  Route / Budget Pine Ridge, S. Dakota My plan is one will last at least up to two years.  After revisiting the Sioux tribe, I will drive through Arizona to visit the Tonto reservation, then New Mexico to meet the Jicarilla-Apache and Mescalero-Apache. Lastly, New Orleans to meet the Houma tribes. After completing this chapter, I would like to continue to work with other minorities scattered throughout the United States, such as the Mormons, Hasidic Jews, etc.I have meticulously researched to assemble a budget and invested as much of my funds as possible.  My budget mainly consists of a live-in van, one that is reliable, where I can sleep and station myself, in addition to a collaborative filmmaker and equipment. The purchase of a live-in van is a long-term practical solution for two reasons: One, it is more economical than renting one for an indefinite period. Two, there is no accommodation on the reservation land for people who do not belong to the indigenous community. Commuting daily would ultimately take hours that I could be spending working on the project.I have calculated that I will need at least $50,000 to begin.  The van at the lowest price is approximately $30,000. Travel and housing will cost around $63,500, and professional assistance will cost roughly $29,000.  Photographic equipment alone is $10,087.58. In total, I have estimated that I will spend $102,587 in the duration of six to eight months to complete the Native American chapter.  Connect With Me / Share Soon, I will be able to share images and footage from this behind the scenes with you! I hope that you follow me on @FatenGaddes and help share my campaign!! Faten with Crys & Michele in front of their house. Oglala Sioux Tribe, S. Dakota ""Being the Chairman of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, I have a great amount of respect for individuals and artists who take time to feature and highlight the lives of Native American People within our country Ms. Gaddes's work as an international artist is gaining recognition, which proves that she brings a wealth of resources to the American fine art communities. Her work in accurately portraying Native Americans brings the benefit of world-class conceptual art to US cultural institutions, thereby informing contemporary culture, politics and society. I absolutely support Faten Gaddes's project and truly look forward to working with her again in the future.""- Boyd I.

<h3>Fine art photographer seeks emergency funds to print and frame work for upcoming Boston gallery show.</h3>
<p><strong>Great News:</strong> I have been selected to be part of a 2 artist photography show: Perception / Abstraction at the Beacon Gallery, an established art gallery in the SOWA art district in Boston, MA. The show will open on March 20th thru April 26, 2020.</p>
<p>What would the world be like if there was no art to enjoy? How does emotion impact memory? How does the familiar slide into the unknown? How do we transform what we’re seeing into something vital and essential about the world we share and live in? </p>
<p>This unique opportunity at the Beacon Gallery is a major step forward in showing a curated selection of my work to a diverse audience including educators, curators and potential collectors.</p>
<p>The on-going costs to print and frame work for the various accepted juried shows exceeds my budget and thats why I am asking you to help contribute. Your support is extremely helpful in order for me to share these images with a wider audience. No contribution is too small or too large. All is very much appreciated! </p>
<p>I am working with 2- excellent regional printes as well as a local framer and have negotiated  pricing to get this work looking beautiful and on time for the March 17th drop off date.  The cost estimates for a mix of dye sublimation aluminum prints and archival pigment prints with framing is <strong>$7,354.00.</strong> All funds raised will go towards this show. I have also applied for an emergency funding grant which can provide up to $1000.00, if selected. In the event that I don't raise all the funds, (I will rob banks, steal kids lunch money, steal old lady's purses in the supermarket-NOT REALLY ), I will use credit cards to pay the balance to fund this show. Kidding aside, I am wary about digging a deeper financial hole using credit cards, but hopefully between donations and sales from the show will help to cover some of the printing and framing or any other additional expenses that I am unable to raise in this campaign. The gallery is generously providing all advertising, catalogs, announcements and the party for the opening reception on April 3rd.</p>
<p>Equally important to making new images is showing my work to new audiences while helping to change and influence the way people look at their world with a different perspective. I am an award winning, mid-career fine art photographer working for over 40 years. I have taught, lectured, mentored and work daily at creating fresh and authentic images and continue to explore the roads less travelled. My photographs have appeared in major online publications, national magazines and newspapers. I currently have photographs in 5 different juried group shows as well as in 2-corporate galleries.</p>
<p>Please follow me on Instagram or Facebook to stay in touch with my work and my progress as a visual story teller. If you love photography, give a shout out to friends, family and associates on your social media and the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for making it to this point of my request and looking forward to learning about you as well. Steve Edson</p>

<h3>Lou Reed in Amsterdam 1972 - 1977</h3>
<p>I'm happy to present to you my new photo-book about legendary musician and poet Lou Reed (Brooklyn NY, March 2 1942 – Southampton NY, October 27 2013). </p>
<div>
<p><strong>One of the greatest artists in rock music</strong></p>
<p>In 1972, Lou Reed releases his first solo album after leaving the legendary rock band The Velvet Underground two years earlier. He also goes on tour. Reed has a contrasting image of sex, drugs &amp; rock ‘n’ roll, and does not hesitate to fool his audience and insult journalists. In these early years, Reed’s solo career is already erratic and reckless but that does not affect his rising popularity. In the mid-seventies, he seems to find his true form on stage and the rock ‘n’ roll animal disappears from view to make way for a more ‘ordinary’ Reed. Musically and lyrically, Reed is a poet. He shows, however, that he is also one of the greatest artists in rock music.</p>
<p><strong>Text and design</strong></p>
<p>Sebastiaan Vos (author of my book ’David Bowie The Seventies’) provides an informative account of the early years of Lou Reed’s solo career and offers an excellently documented description of my photographs of Reed. Chiel Veffer is responsible for the beautiful design of the book.</p>
<p><strong>My number five</strong></p>
<p>After the publication of my book ‘Abba...Zappa Seventies Rock Photography’ I made a few more successful books about artists: David Bowie, Patti Smith, Bob Marley, and The Rolling Stones. I thought a book with Lou Reed as the subject, one of my favorite artists, shouldn’t be missing. And voila, it’s coming: Lou Reed in Amsterdam. </p>

</div></div>","Lou Reed in Amsterdam 1972 - 1977
I'm happy to present to you my new photo-book about legendary musician and poet Lou Reed (Brooklyn NY, March 2 1942 – Southampton NY, October 27 2013). 

One of the greatest artists in rock music
In 1972, Lou Reed releases his first solo album after leaving the legendary rock band The Velvet Underground two years earlier. He also goes on tour. Reed has a contrasting image of sex, drugs & rock ‘n’ roll, and does not hesitate to fool his audience and insult journalists. In these early years, Reed’s solo career is already erratic and reckless but that does not affect his rising popularity. In the mid-seventies, he seems to find his true form on stage and the rock ‘n’ roll animal disappears from view to make way for a more ‘ordinary’ Reed. Musically and lyrically, Reed is a poet. He shows, however, that he is also one of the greatest artists in rock music.
Text and design
Sebastiaan Vos (author of my book ’David Bowie The Seventies’) provides an informative account of the early years of Lou Reed’s solo career and offers an excellently documented description of my photographs of Reed. Chiel Veffer is responsible for the beautiful design of the book.
My number five
After the publication of my book ‘Abba...Zappa Seventies Rock Photography’ I made a few more successful books about artists: David Bowie, Patti Smith, Bob Marley, and The Rolling Stones. I thought a book with Lou Reed as the subject, one of my favorite artists, shouldn’t be missing. And voila, it’s coming: Lou Reed in Amsterdam. 

 
Order now
This is not a classic help-me-out crowd funding campaign. The book will be out in the second half of May. The circulation is limited to 750 copies. You are the first to hear about the book and can pre-order it now. Order the book now and you will have an autographed copy soon.
Or,
Order two copies of the book. One for yourself and one to give away or archive.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Your contribution to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FacesofReadingplus10/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Faces of Reading + 10</a> will ensure that every Face is represented by a high quality durably mounted print on the Freedman Gallery Wall, helping visitors to see, at a glance, the distinctive diversity of the Reading community. Careful mounting will also give Faces a life beyond the current exhibition.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming for $9000, the amount we need for high quality mounted prints of every Face. If we raise in excess of $9000, that additional amount will help to fund our ongoing efforts at community photography in Reading, and possibly towards a print publication based on Faces of Reading + 10. We are offering several perks in addition to our thanks: prints, posters, and photo sessions, depending on your contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Faces of Reading exhibition in 2005 gave thousands of visitors the chance to envision the Reading community in all its diversity. Participants were excited to see themselves as part of a larger whole. And everyone was prompted to reflect on their own relationship to society. If we can achieve the same high production values, we hope that this new exhibition will have an even greater impact.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we fall short in our campaign, there will still be an exhibition. Many participants have made contributions, as has Albright College, of course. But it might turn out that the prints would not be of high quality or that many of the Faces would appear as projections. We have plans B &amp; C, but we have high hopes that you will support a truly beautiful exhibition.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that many residents of Reading, including many of the people we photographed, lack the means to make a monetary contributions. We hope that everyone will participate by visiting the Faces of Reading  + 10 exhibition at the Freedman Gallery at Albright College. We hope that they will encourage their friends to visit. We hope that you will take a few moments to share this Indiegogo link with your own social media community.</p>

</div><p>Most of my photography is of perfect structures or about perfect design. My hobby consists of beautiful spaces carefully designed and meticulously prepared for the camera. I am, however, also drawn to photograph an entirely different kind of architecture. These buildings are not new, well maintained, or filled with life. They're empty, abandoned, and worn out. Life has passed them by, and for obvious reasons, they are no longer useful or needed. To me they are mysterious and melancholy, hauntingly beautiful in some strange way, and more fascinating than new structures.</p><p>In preparing this collection, I found myself thinking about what draws me to these decaying structures. Why the attraction to these ruins? Have I been trying to tell myself something? Growing up in Izmir, I've always appreciated wide-open spaces and a sense of isolation, but I don't think my interest comes from that. I love history and am attracted to significant sites, but this work is not an expression of that particularly. I've been influenced by artists who create works of emptiness and melancholy, but I am not attempting to emulate those images, either.</p><p>Maybe these buildings fascinate me because they represent all of us; maybe they are symbols of our own impermanent status here on earth - metaphors for our transient lives and inability to stop the passing of time. The Bible says that in this world we have no enduring city, but we look forward to a city whose architect and builder is God. Jesus told us not to lay up treasures on earth, where moth and rust corrupt and thieves break in and steal, but to lay up treasures in heaven. Are these buildings reminders or allegories of something we are reluctant to acknowledge? A couple of weeks before my Grandpa died last year, my father and I were helping him out of his bed to go to the bathroom. As he struggled down the hall, he said quietly, ""take a good look, boys, this is going to be you sooner than you think."" He is right. Our lives go by so quickly and we leave behind the relics of our time here and of what we thought was important. Deep down I know this earth is not my home, that ""I'm just passing through,"" as the old gospel song says.</p><p>When I'm around these buildings, I can't help thinking about the life that went on within their walls and wondering what happened to the folks who prayed there. Will someone stand in my church someday and wonder the same things?

My hobby consists of beautiful spaces carefully designed and meticulously prepared for the camera. I am, however, also drawn to photograph an entirely different kind of architecture. These buildings are not new, well maintained, or filled with life. They're empty, abandoned, and worn out. Life has passed them by, and for obvious reasons, they are no longer useful or needed. To me they are mysterious and melancholy, hauntingly beautiful in some strange way, and more fascinating than new structures.In preparing this collection, I found myself thinking about what draws me to these decaying structures. Why the attraction to these ruins? Have I been trying to tell myself something? Growing up in Izmir, I've always appreciated wide-open spaces and a sense of isolation, but I don't think my interest comes from that. I love history and am attracted to significant sites, but this work is not an expression of that particularly. I've been influenced by artists who create works of emptiness and melancholy, but I am not attempting to emulate those images, either.Maybe these buildings fascinate me because they represent all of us; maybe they are symbols of our own impermanent status here on earth - metaphors for our transient lives and inability to stop the passing of time. The Bible says that in this world we have no enduring city, but we look forward to a city whose architect and builder is God. Jesus told us not to lay up treasures on earth, where moth and rust corrupt and thieves break in and steal, but to lay up treasures in heaven. Are these buildings reminders or allegories of something we are reluctant to acknowledge? A couple of weeks before my Grandpa died last year, my father and I were helping him out of his bed to go to the bathroom. As he struggled down the hall, he said quietly, ""take a good look, boys, this is going to be you sooner than you think."" He is right. Our lives go by so quickly and we leave behind the relics of our time here and of what we thought was important. Deep down I know this earth is not my home, that ""I'm just passing through,"" as the old gospel song says.When I'm around these buildings, I can't help thinking about the life that went on within their walls and wondering what happened to the folks who prayed there. Will someone stand in my church someday and wonder the same things? That makes me a bit uneasy, but it also helps me understand why I find old, worn-out paint, broken walls, and sagging floors in some ways more beautiful than brand new houses, where everything is perfect. I know that someday soon that broken down house is going to resemble me, or my loved ones. Deep down inside I wonder if I'll still be appreciated and valued when I'm no longer productive, have outlived my usefulness, and cost a lot just to maintain, like these buildings.

<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>I’m heading to Italy this fall to begin work on a We Are 25, a hybrid photography and research project that I truly believe in.  You can read all about it below, and also you can learn about what a huge difference you can make in the success of my project.  </p>
<p><strong>The Mystery, The Story</strong></p>
<p>Sometime in the not-so-distant past, a group of 25 men in poverty-stricken Southern Italy shared an experience so intense that their surnames became Venticinque, literally the Italian word for 25.   What happened, exactly, is where the mystery comes in:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Was it a shipwrecked boat of laborers with only 25 heartbroken survivors?</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">A 25-man brigade valorously fighting for (or maybe against) a united Italy? </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Some other story of courage and/or tragedy? </li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, the original group of 25 has expanded to approximately 1,700, most still in Italy but also spread in pockets worldwide. (Including just over 200 in the US).  We have carried this name-- and its mysteries-- for all this time, yet nobody has conducted a proper exploration or explanation of its origins. I am determined to uncover the answer to the question of how a group of people got a number for their name.</p>
<p>This project is leading me through an in-depth exploration of the name Venticinque: its origin and subsequent storyline, the people who have carried the name through time and space, and what it all tells us about the world we live in.  I am calling this project We Are 25 because it is about the story that we, the descendants of the original 25, can tell together through the process of reconnecting.  </p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>I recently received the incredible invitation to be Artist in Residence for an Italian language &amp; culture institute in Pennabilli, a tiny town in Northern Italy where I am thrilled to be heading in early September.  While there, I will be working on improving my Italian language skills (I have been studying for years, though in a rather casual capacity) and refining my portraiture style, as well as producing visual media for the institute's marketing needs. I will be working hard while I'm there, and loving the work I'll be doing. </p>
<p>After my residency concludes in mid-September, I will begin the first major phase of my project We Are 25, traveling down through the South of Italy, specifically the areas around Naples and Calabria and then down to the small village in Sicily that is likely the epicenter of the Venticinque origin story. This southern region is the very land from which many Venticinques fled to escape the extreme poverty, disease, and fascism that was rampant at the time.  While it is estimated that over 4 million Italians (mostly from the South) fled between 1880-1926, one of the unique opportunities that studying the distinctively-named Venticinque family presents is the ability to track them over time and space, and by extension to discover the ties that connect them. </p>
<p>For the past several years, I have been researching the history and steadily building connections with Venticinques throughout Italy and across the U.S.  I’ve long been curious about what the individuals in the group know about its history and lineage; also, I've grown increasingly interested in the people themselves.  We all share a common name, yet the vast diversity of our life circumstances tells a timely story about immigration and the spectrum between cultural preservation and assimilation.  Now is the moment when I am ready to step into the next phase of my inquiry, when I can finally begin contacting members of the extended Venticinque family to make plans to meet them in person and to create a series of portraits.</p>
<p>Artistically speaking, for this project I will be using classical black &amp; white portraiture techniques, stripping things down to the simplest form to create timeless images.  My goal is to create authentic images that reflect the beauty of each subject, and also blur the lines between the things that so often divide: generations, continents, ethnicities, languages, races.  Each individual portrait tells a story, inviting the viewer to imagine the history behind the subject's face; as a collection of images, they can show the very human way in which we can connect, regardless of the things that may seem to divide us.  </p>
<p>In addition to meeting and photographing these distant cousins (who may or may not be related by blood), I will be conducting interviews and collecting stories.  I am excited to speak with people  about what they know of the meaning and history behind the Venticinque mystery and, even more importantly, about their own lives.  Eventually I will compile these images and narrative accounts into multimedia presentations and public exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>Why this project matters</strong></p>
<p>    •    <strong>WeAre25 is, at its root, a story about immigration and its impact through the generations.  </strong>Through research, recorded histories and personal stories, there is much to learn from a group of people who fled their homeland, as well as from those who remained.  Considering that there is a worldwide struggle to manage increasing immigration, and Sicily itself is currently experiencing an immigration crisis on a catastrophic scale, this is a perfect opportunity to explore the layers underlying current policies and attitudes.  In addition, Italy is currently experiencing a new wave of white supremacy (""Europe First""); this project is aimed at </p>
<p>    •    <strong>It's a story of culture heritage and how it has been preserved or forgotten.  </strong>These days, many of the world's rich and diverse cultures run the risk of being engulfed and erased by a  rootless construct of ""whiteness"".  It is now more important than ever to resist this outcome by remembering and celebrating our diverse cultural roots, and this project is poised to illustrate that in a compelling and engaging way.</p>
<p>    •    <strong> It's a story about ethnicity &amp; race</strong>: Southern Italians (and Sicilians in particular) are a genetic kaleidoscope when it comes to race, and their ethnicity is one of the most complex and diverse on the planet.  Over the years, their land has been conquered and inhabited by a variety of people: Arabs, Greeks, Normans, Moors and more.  Because of their complex background and ambiguous ethnicity, Southern Italians offer a unique look into the concept  race and how it has been constructed.  <br/> </p>
<p><strong>Why me, why now?</strong></p>
<p>One could insist that I was destined to do this project: after all, I was born on 5/25 with the surname ""25"", an insatiable curiosity, and a passion for photographic storytelling.  I have been dreaming of and laying the groundwork for this project for nearly ten years. but it is this exact moment in time that I am poised to take the first big step in the project.  Thanks to the opportunity to go to Italy for an artistic residency this fall, the time to compete the first stage of We Are 25 has finally arrived.  </p>
<p>Telling stories through photographs is my life's work.  As a longtime professional photographer specializing in portraiture, working with a subject to create a portrait is the most effect way for me to get to know someone.  Collaborating with my subjects, I find that a mutual connection is built; there is something about the mix of my personality plus the vulnerability of being photographed that allows people to open up and share. Creating a beautiful portrait of someone that they love is one of the most important gifts that I have to offer people.  </p>
<p>Over the years, some of my most meaningful and successful photographic work has been my portraits and stories from the road.  Whether it was older gentlemen in the streets of Sicily, the endless crowds and booming sound systems of London's famous Notting Hill Carnival, or any one of the countless beautiful faces I have photographed along the way— chances are that if you've followed my career (or my social media), you have seen some images that caused you to stop and think, and perhaps learn something new about the wider world.  Just this past year, I hosted multiple exhibits of photographs I created during previous travels through Italy; I also delivered a public educational talk about traveling through Southern Italy.</p>
<p>Added to my lifetime of passion for and experience with photography, I also have a background in documentary media &amp; cultural anthropology.  I am deeply interested in people's stories, on both an individual and a group level.  Through this project, I will invite people to share their stories: what is like to live in modern-day Italy, what they know of the family history, how they are positioned in terms of immigration.  Back in the U.S., I will conduct similar sessions with Venticinques, but in these cases my questions will aim to explore how culture has been preserved or lost, whether or not they identify as immigrants, and how they identify themselves in terms of ethnicity and nationality.  I will be gathering these stories and using them in conjunction with the portraits to create a larger work of art.</p>
<p>Simply put: I am called to do this work, and I truly believe in this project.   As I have the opportunity to go to Italy this fall, I want to take full advantage of the chance to launch the first full phase successfully.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I need your help raising the necessary funds to cover my expenses for this stage of my project. <strong> I am asking you -- yes, you! -- for a donation of $25.</strong>  I chose this amount for a few good reasons: a25 is my favorite #, b)it's likely to be affordable to most of you, and c) this is the amount I give to pretty much any campaign that directly asks me for support or randomly grabs my attention.</p>
<p>Have more to give?  You’re in luck!  I have some<strong> fabulous incentives to entice you</strong> to offer a more substantial gift. Your contribution will make a huge difference to me, helping me to cover my significant production costs to make this first major part of my project a reality and to pave the way for its future success.  Check out my incentives— I think they’re pretty great!</p>
<p><u>Your contribution will help me cover important project-related expenses:</u></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Transportation costs: While I'm a pro at traveling on a tight budget, I have an array of transportation needs </li>
<li>Accommodation:  Thanks to my excellent Artist in Residence opportunity, my accommodation is free for the first 2.5 weeks I'm in Italy.  Then from 9/21-10/10, I'm on my own.  My plan is to stay at simple pensiones, Air BnBs, agriturismos, and inns along the way; also, I'm trying to stay with friends (and friends' friends....) whenever possible.  Anywhere safe for me &amp; my gear.</li>
<li>Meals on the road.  Fortunately, it's Italy, so the food is inexpensive, plentiful, and delicious!</li>
<li>A lightweight tripod that I can easily travel with</li>
<li>A lav (clip-on) microphone for video interviews</li>
<li>A digital audio recorder</li>
<li>Travel Insurance: important to cover my photo gear</li>

<li>Miscellaneous supplies</li>
<li>Emergency just-in-case funds</li>
<li>Expenses related to public exhibition/presentations upon my return</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can make it happen</strong></p>
<p>You support will directly enable me to complete this work that I am passionate about and completely dedicated to doing.  It's simple:  without the funds I need, I can't do the work.  But <i>with </i>the backing I need... I'll be able to give my plans &amp; my project the support they deserve. </p>
<p>I deeply believe that the We Are 25 story, with its focus on a defined group of people, is a valuable <strong>opportunity to explore larger themes that are important and timely</strong>.  Because this particular case group is so small, it presents a unique opportunity to trace and study a group of people making their way through the world over time.  Not only are the descendants of the original Venticinques easy to identify &amp; locate by their rare and distinctive surname, they also share a bond because of the enigmatic nature of the name itself.</p>
<p>The backing of my community is what will enable me to accomplish my mission.  I know there are many of you who believe in me and the work that I do, and plenty of you whose lives have been directly touched by my photography. Your support means so very much to me.  I am happy and grateful to be living the life of a working artist, but in this case I need to turn to my network to ask for help to make this a reality.  <br/><br/><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>For more than a year, I have been building relationships with members of the Venticinque network across Italy and the US.  It has been a fun process, and I've found responses from other Venticinques to be surprisingly enthusiastic.  I already have tentative meetings and portrait sessions set up for this fall, and I am beyond ready to get started.  Once I raise enough money to sustain me, I will begin to make travel arrangements and concrete appointments with the first tier of people on my list (starting in Naples).  I can't wait to share what I find with all of you! </p>
<p>The main purpose of this trip is to gather an initial round of images and stories, laying the foundation of this project which will one day be something much bigger. In the months after I return, I will synthesize what I've gathered to create a presentation for public viewing, offering a series of public viewings and talks.  In early 2019, I will use all that I have gathered create a pitch; I'll bring it to several organizations to request further funding for a larger project:  Italian-American foundations, documentary film producers, cultural research programs, and book publishers.  By funding this critical phase of my project, you are enabling me to create a quality body of work that can stand on its own <i>and</i> serve as a foundation to build to a bigger scale. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I hope that by asking for a manageable $25, a great number of you will be able to comfortably contribute to my campaign.  But even if you're not able to contribute financially, there are other great ways to give your support:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>
<u>Connect me with places to stay.</u>  If you have Italian (or expat) friends who love hosting guests, or have a property with some extra space, I would so appreciate trying to make something work.  I'm an excellent guest, and don't mind having to sing for my supper.</li>
<li>
<u>Share your travel-related resources </u>(hotel points, sky miles, etc.). Everything helps!</li>
<li>
<u>Introduce me to my new Italian BFF</u>.  Know someone in Italy and think we'd hit it off?  If you think we'll get along, then I'm happy to meet them with a smile! I love making new friends, and would appreciate any and all connections I can make.</li>

I deeply believe that the We Are 25 story, with its focus on a defined group of people, is a valuable opportunity to explore larger themes that are important and timely.  Because this particular case group is so small, it presents a unique opportunity to trace and study a group of people making their way through the world over time.  Not only are the descendants of the original Venticinques easy to identify & locate by their rare and distinctive surname, they also share a bond because of the enigmatic nature of the name itself.
The backing of my community is what will enable me to accomplish my mission.  I know there are many of you who believe in me and the work that I do, and plenty of you whose lives have been directly touched by my photography. Your support means so very much to me.  I am happy and grateful to be living the life of a working artist, but in this case I need to turn to my network to ask for help to make this a reality.  Next Steps
For more than a year, I have been building relationships with members of the Venticinque network across Italy and the US.  It has been a fun process, and I've found responses from other Venticinques to be surprisingly enthusiastic.  I already have tentative meetings and portrait sessions set up for this fall, and I am beyond ready to get started.  Once I raise enough money to sustain me, I will begin to make travel arrangements and concrete appointments with the first tier of people on my list (starting in Naples).  I can't wait to share what I find with all of you! 
The main purpose of this trip is to gather an initial round of images and stories, laying the foundation of this project which will one day be something much bigger. In the months after I return, I will synthesize what I've gathered to create a presentation for public viewing, offering a series of public viewings and talks.  In early 2019, I will use all that I have gathered create a pitch; I'll bring it to several organizations to request further funding for a larger project:  Italian-American foundations, documentary film producers, cultural research programs, and book publishers.  By funding this critical phase of my project, you are enabling me to create a quality body of work that can stand on its own and serve as a foundation to build to a bigger scale. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
I hope that by asking for a manageable $25, a great number of you will be able to comfortably contribute to my campaign.  But even if you're not able to contribute financially, there are other great ways to give your support:


Connect me with places to stay.  If you have Italian (or expat) friends who love hosting guests, or have a property with some extra space, I would so appreciate trying to make something work.  I'm an excellent guest, and don't mind having to sing for my supper.

Share your travel-related resources (hotel points, sky miles, etc.). Everything helps!

Introduce me to my new Italian BFF.  Know someone in Italy and think we'd hit it off?  If you think we'll get along, then I'm happy to meet them with a smile! I love making new friends, and would appreciate any and all connections I can make.

Spread the word!  If you can think of someone who would be interested in Italy, immigration history, or portrait photography?  Please share my information with them!  

Share my campaign on social media.  This will have a huge impact on my campaign. Please hit ""share"" and tell people why you think they should consider contributing as well.  

Stay connected & follow the journey

Visit my website www.WeAre25.com,   It’s a small spot now, but it will be expanding in the weeks and months to come.  Stay tuned!  
Before I say arrivaderci...
Thank you very much for taking the time to read through this.  And thank you for your ongoing  support.  I have faith that by reaching out to many of the beautiful and supportive people I know, I will be able to meet my goal.  After all, it'll only take 160 of you giving $25!  Please consider making a contribution in whatever amount you are able.  I can't wait to share what I discover!

<p><b>The Problem: Lack of Affordable Housing caused Homelessness </b></p>
<p><i>The lack of affordable housing is the number one cause of homelessness in the United States. </i>The longer we wait to take
action to address homelessness, <i>people suffer</i>. Everyday we hold up the false narrative that homelessness is something
that is not easily addressed; <i>people suffer</i>. Everyday we extend that narrative to come up with another reason to not move
forward with a long term solution, <i>people suffer</i>.
</p>
<p>Housing is the number one expense for low-income, working class, and even middle class families. <b>No other sector of
the US economy demands more from a single individual or family than the real estate sector.</b> Affordable housing is an
economic issue. The real estate market has not always been as it is today. However, due to the financial crash of 2008
millions of families lost their homes. This created demand in the rental market in towns and cities across the country.
Paired with the Millennial generation, now the largest generation in the United States, coming onto the rental market <span style=""background-color: initial;"">- demand on the housing supply in urban centers has skyrocketed. This demand has far outpaced development in our
urban centers. What we are seeing across the country in cities like New York, San Francisco, and most prominently, Los
Angeles, will soon affect every major urban center on the planet.</span></p>
<p><b>This issue extends far beyond homelessness.</b> This issue is an immediate threat to the prosperity of our future cities.
Without a strategic plan to address the housing crisis facing our urban centers in the United States; our cities will be no
place to live. This can be seen and experienced today in cities such as Los Angeles; where tents line the streets of our
downtown cores, local restaurants and retailers implement customer only bathroom policies - limiting and discriminating
bathroom use for homeless individuals, and an overall sense of imbalance as you walk the streets of a developing yet
morally decaying city.
</p>
<p><i>The United Nations World Urbanization Prospects</i> findings suggest that in the coming decades there will be a continued
migration of people into new and existing Urban Centers. <b>By 2050, it is projected that 66% of our global population
will live in urban centers; this equates to 6.4 billion people. </b>Today, our urban centers hold about 3.5 billion people. In
order to address the demand over the coming decades we need a strategic plan to invest in affordable housing for all.
</p>
<p><b>We are the wealthiest nation on the planet.</b> We have an abundance of resources available to our nation; and yet, we have
millions of people that sleep on the streets by no choice of their own. This is entirely unacceptable. Furthermore, in this
time of unprecedented wealth in this country and our planet; homelessness and poverty are a disgrace to humanity. <i>We
have a moral imperative to come together as one race, the human race, and solve this issue. </i></p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><b>Our Solution: Sustaynabl Housing</b></p>
<p>We believe the nature of human experience is shifting to a model where passion and purpose are the metrics by
which human life is measured. <b>Experience and human connection will hold greater value than our current monetary
metric of social capital. </b>Providing architectural, inspiring, and affordable housing - we open up humanity to a new era of
human capital. Artists can be artists. Young persons can feel safe in taking time to find their passion and purpose. Through
decreased housing expenses, increased discretionary income, and more time spent in healthy and stable environments,
individuals and families will have more opportunity to fully experience their humanity.
</p>
<p>It is relevant to understand the underlying issues related to the development process in our urban centers, the current
methodologies at work in urban centers across the United States, and across other urban centers that are experiencing
and addressing this growth. We believe it is important to understand the roadblocks to development in our cities to
adequately address the housing shortages currently being experienced. These roadblocks include access to land +
capital, financial markets dictating unprecedented and unnecessary returns on investment, and city regulatory hurdles that
prevent scalable and sustainable development from moving forward.
</p>
<p>Looking to other cities that have began addressing the issues at hand; we found it imperative to look to the global
market. For example, China holds three of the largest urban centers on our planet. China is a model to expand upon for
sustainable growth of our future cities. Access to capital, return on investment, and development + construction time are
three factors limiting growth in US cities. Sustaynabl’s partnership with <i>Broad Group </i>addresses these issues.
</p>
<p>Sustaynabl’s model is to develop <i>Mixed-Income + Mixed-Use Urban Developments</i> in the United States. Through an innovative partnership with the <i>Broad Group</i>, we are able to decrease the cost of development to 40% of similar
traditional developments in the United States today. <i>Broad Group</i> has developed specialized prefabricated building
technology that allows for drastic cost reduction, waste reduction, and increased building quality and safety. This key
feature allows our financial model to provide an excellent return on investment while providing unprecedented impact in
a new era of private-public housing solutions.
</p>
<p>Following guidelines set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sustaynabl rental rates do not
exceed 30% of unit income. <b>All of Sustaynabl’s rental units are affordable</b>. Additionally, our <b>long term solution to
homelessness </b>provides at least<i> 10% of our units to at-risk homeless + currently homeless individuals, with a priority on homeless youth - specifically LGBTQ youth in Los Angeles, mothers, families, and veterans. </i>With every Sustaynabl
development, we add more transitional homeless housing units to the market. Additionally, we diversify the location of
the homeless population across the city. This allows individuals the opportunity to more easily integrate into their new
community by removing them from the influences of their past surroundings. <b>This is a continual and exponential strategy
to decrease the number of homeless individuals on the streets.
</b></p>
<p>We decrease poverty by building community.
</p>
<p>We have developed an impact model that measures the statistical advantages Sustaynabl developments have on
communities in which they are developed. <i>Through decreases in housing-related spending, we see an increased
stabilization of currently unstable economic communities.</i> Additionally, there is an increase in non-housing spending. This
leads to grassroots economic revitalization. This provides boosts to non-housing related sectors of these economies. <b>This,
in turn, jump-starts the virtuous cycle of economic prosperity through affordable housing development. </b></p>

will live in urban centers; this equates to 6.4 billion people. Today, our urban centers hold about 3.5 billion people. In
order to address the demand over the coming decades we need a strategic plan to invest in affordable housing for all.

We are the wealthiest nation on the planet. We have an abundance of resources available to our nation; and yet, we have
millions of people that sleep on the streets by no choice of their own. This is entirely unacceptable. Furthermore, in this
time of unprecedented wealth in this country and our planet; homelessness and poverty are a disgrace to humanity. We
have a moral imperative to come together as one race, the human race, and solve this issue. 







Our Solution: Sustaynabl Housing
We believe the nature of human experience is shifting to a model where passion and purpose are the metrics by
which human life is measured. Experience and human connection will hold greater value than our current monetary
metric of social capital. Providing architectural, inspiring, and affordable housing - we open up humanity to a new era of
human capital. Artists can be artists. Young persons can feel safe in taking time to find their passion and purpose. Through
decreased housing expenses, increased discretionary income, and more time spent in healthy and stable environments,
individuals and families will have more opportunity to fully experience their humanity.

It is relevant to understand the underlying issues related to the development process in our urban centers, the current
methodologies at work in urban centers across the United States, and across other urban centers that are experiencing
and addressing this growth. We believe it is important to understand the roadblocks to development in our cities to
adequately address the housing shortages currently being experienced. These roadblocks include access to land +
capital, financial markets dictating unprecedented and unnecessary returns on investment, and city regulatory hurdles that
prevent scalable and sustainable development from moving forward.

Looking to other cities that have began addressing the issues at hand; we found it imperative to look to the global
market. For example, China holds three of the largest urban centers on our planet. China is a model to expand upon for
sustainable growth of our future cities. Access to capital, return on investment, and development + construction time are
three factors limiting growth in US cities. Sustaynabl’s partnership with Broad Group addresses these issues.

Sustaynabl’s model is to develop Mixed-Income + Mixed-Use Urban Developments in the United States. Through an innovative partnership with the Broad Group, we are able to decrease the cost of development to 40% of similar
traditional developments in the United States today. Broad Group has developed specialized prefabricated building
technology that allows for drastic cost reduction, waste reduction, and increased building quality and safety. This key
feature allows our financial model to provide an excellent return on investment while providing unprecedented impact in
a new era of private-public housing solutions.

Following guidelines set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sustaynabl rental rates do not
exceed 30% of unit income. All of Sustaynabl’s rental units are affordable. Additionally, our long term solution to
homelessness provides at least 10% of our units to at-risk homeless + currently homeless individuals, with a priority on homeless youth - specifically LGBTQ youth in Los Angeles, mothers, families, and veterans. With every Sustaynabl
development, we add more transitional homeless housing units to the market. Additionally, we diversify the location of
the homeless population across the city. This allows individuals the opportunity to more easily integrate into their new
community by removing them from the influences of their past surroundings. This is a continual and exponential strategy
to decrease the number of homeless individuals on the streets.

We decrease poverty by building community.

We have developed an impact model that measures the statistical advantages Sustaynabl developments have on
communities in which they are developed. Through decreases in housing-related spending, we see an increased
stabilization of currently unstable economic communities. Additionally, there is an increase in non-housing spending. This
leads to grassroots economic revitalization. This provides boosts to non-housing related sectors of these economies. This,
in turn, jump-starts the virtuous cycle of economic prosperity through affordable housing development. 








    Risks & Challenges The book is complete and the first copies will be delivered in June 2016.
Risk: If we do not address the issue of homelessness as a human rights issue; millions of humans in the United States will continue to go without homes. 
Challenges: Our job now is to get this book and project in the hands of millions of Angelenos, Americans, and the Global population to create the movement and energy to address the issue of homelessness once and for all.

<p>3000 km, 45 days, 2 islands, 1 camera – be my companion and yours can be different products.</p>
<p>Let me take you on a journey, to a land where wonder grows. It is a place where shores of gold greet you. Here’s where the spirits of the land tell you tales from long ago. Let me lead you to secrets hidden beneath green hills… to somewhere like nowhere you’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>In the journey to discover this wonderful land… to avoid missing out I have no choice except to go all in. And the fastest way forward is leaving all of my worries behind. This year come with me on an adventure where you have nothing to lose and the only thing to fear is missing out.</p>
<p>Last year I realized that living isn’t the same as being alive. Now that I am here I have learned that the road to self-discovery… starts with a leap of faith. Come with me on a journey where the only way to find yourself is to get lost.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Who I am? </strong></li></ul>
<p>My name is Benjámin Kozár. I am from Hungary. I have started learning photography 10 years ago, but as I started to grow up I lost the opportunity to progress in it. At the University and next to work I didn’t have time for it anymore. Last year as I fought my way out of cancer I rediscovered photography again. In March I won the opportunity to study at the University of Otago. It is in Dunedin, New Zealand. It was my dream to visit New Zealand since I first saw The Lord of the Rings in the cinema in 2001. I have fought 17 years to achieve this dream of mine.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Why I need Indiegogo?</strong></li></ul>
<p>As I have written in the introduction last year I had cancer. Because of a life saving surgery and chemoteraphy I was out of work for 10 months. During this period I used up all my savings – medicines, CTs, food, travel to hospital etc.</p>
<p>I started working again in 2017. December and now in July I have arrived to Dunedin. This 7 months of work was just barely enough to get enough money for airplane tickets and a few months of food – apart from the study costs.</p>
<p>According to the laws of New Zealand as an international exchange student I am not allowed to work. I started this Indiegogo campaign to get a little bit more money to achieve my dream of seeing New Zealand. It is my childhood dream and I have fought hard for this opportunity to get here. It is highly possible that I will never have the opportunity to get here again.</p>
<ul><li><strong>What I am planning to make? </strong></li></ul>
<p>I am planning to do a 45 days trip around the 2 islands. It is more than 3000 km. During this journey I’m going to take a lot of photos. Through the lens of my camera I’m going to present the landscapes, the flora and fauna, and the culture of this land. I am going to make a 3-part photo album, each of it representing one of the previously mentioned areas.</p>
<ul><li><strong>When will you get your reward?</strong></li></ul>
<p>According to my plan I will travel back to Europe in the early days of December 2018. The first shipment of the perks will be mailed at the beginning of January 2019.</p>

<p>Nel viaggo alla scoperta di questa meravigliosa terra… per non perdere nulla delle ricchezze di questa terra non ho altra scelta che dare il 100% .

<p>L’anno scorso mi sono reso conto che vivere non é la stessa cosa di essere vivo. Ora che sono qui, sto per imparare che la strada per la scoperta di sé… inizia con un salto di fede. Vieni con me in un viaggio dove l’unico modo per trovarti é quello di perdersi. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Star Wars 1977 , the original movie has had a profound influence on me as a child and even now as a man. My creative mind was ignited thanks to this ground braking film. Sure I had the action figures, the posters, the comic books even the record just like so many other fans. Phrases like ‘evil empire’ and ‘May the Force be with you’ have become popular lexicon. The characters and their themes that revolved around myths and legends are universal. It’s because of this one film I became a filmmaker and photographer. Star Wars helped me to open my mind, to create, to think the impossible was possible.  </p>
<p>I have taken on a substantial investment by curating these images. I use lots of props, jewelry and custom masks and costumes. All of this and the photo gear to shoot and edit has taken so much time to accumulate. There is no way I could ever recoup the money and time spent on this project. I did it because I was and still am inspired by this sci-fi universe. </p>
<p>I have been blessed to of worked with so many different creative open-minded models and friends in creating this project. </p>
<p>My main goal is to get my art that I have worked so hard on making into the hands of like minded individuals. What better way than a calendar. This project is for the fans, the cosplayers, the dreamers who enjoy the 'little rebel' that these films fuel.</p>
<p>I have had the oppertunity showcase my Sexy Fan Photography in different  Art Galleries and the reaction I received was so positive and full of excitement towards the satire I brought to this theme. Sexy Fan Photography is all about fun and creativity.</p>

<p>Some people eat to live. I live to eat. For me, food is more than sustenance. I love food and how healthy it can be for the mind, body, and soul. In fact, food is a passion second only to my desire to express the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. The camera is my way of doing just that. Instead of a picture worth a thousand words, I strive for images that balance health and hunger. If my imagery reminds people of their physical relationship with food, increases their passion for sustenance, and makes their mouths water, then my hunger is satisfied too.</p>
<p>Real, healthy, beautiful, delicious food: that is what I bring to the table.</p>Through professional quality, mouth watering photography, local food based businesses gain credibility, appeal, and branding inspiring their customers to crave their food and come back wanting more.  Starry Photography believes that real food is beautiful, which is why we only photograph 100% natural and edible food.<br/><p></p>
<p>Katie Starry, owner and lead photographer, has a degree in Professional Photography from Colorado Mountain College.  She has an extensive portfolio of food images showcasing true, wholesome products both in the setting of a restaurant and in the studio.</p>
<p>In addition to photography, Katie is a Personal Trainer and Nutrition Coach.  She has a true passion to help people be the healthiest they can be.  This passion shines through in her photography and reveals that healthy food can be just as appetizing as the not so healthful alternative.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The reason for seeking funding is so that Katie can focus all of her time and energy on her photography business and take that leap to following this dream.  Starry Photography will change the face of food photography in the Denver area by photographing real food, focusing on small local food/beverage based businesses, and offering extreme customer service.</p>

<p>MYCAMPAIGN
/ МОЯ КАМПАНИЯ </p>
<p>So my
IndiGoGo campaign ended yesterday – cordial thanks to supporters, who shared
info, and especially to ones who became backers and who invested in my project.
Funds we gathered (though it is less than one fifth part of expected goal) will
allow me to cover expenses of the book design-layout, to print limited series
of book copies (as prototype and rewards), to deliver all perks to backers. We
did a very important step! And results coming soon......</p>
<p>*** </p>
<p>Итак, вчера завершилась моя кампания на IndieGoGo –
сердечное спасибо всем поддержавшим, и тем, кто делился моей информацией, и, в
особенности, тем, кто стал инвестором проекта, вложив свои деньги. Собранные
средства (хотя это пятая часть ожидавшейся суммы) позволят покрыть расходы на
дизайн и верстку книги, на печать ограниченного тиража книги (прототип и
подарки инвесторам), на доставку всех вознаграждений инвесторам. Мы сделали
важный шаг! Результаты – скоро…. </p>-------------------------------------------------</span></h1>

MYCAMPAIGN
/ МОЯ КАМПАНИЯ 
So my
IndiGoGo campaign ended yesterday – cordial thanks to supporters, who shared
info, and especially to ones who became backers and who invested in my project.
Funds we gathered (though it is less than one fifth part of expected goal) will
allow me to cover expenses of the book design-layout, to print limited series
of book copies (as prototype and rewards), to deliver all perks to backers. We
did a very important step! And results coming soon......
*** 
Итак, вчера завершилась моя кампания на IndieGoGo –
сердечное спасибо всем поддержавшим, и тем, кто делился моей информацией, и, в
особенности, тем, кто стал инвестором проекта, вложив свои деньги. Собранные
средства (хотя это пятая часть ожидавшейся суммы) позволят покрыть расходы на
дизайн и верстку книги, на печать ограниченного тиража книги (прототип и
подарки инвесторам), на доставку всех вознаграждений инвесторам. Мы сделали
важный шаг! Результаты – скоро…. -------------------------------------------------
ФОТОКНИГА ""СИБИРЯКИ: ГЛУБИНКА""

There is surface and depth: political madness and daily life apart, hot
news and eternal songs, otherness and kinship. When you are sharing simple human things with someone and feel the commonality behind the differences – there are more chances to understand
than to fight...

***

Есть поверхность и есть глубина: политические безумства - и будни вдали от столиц, горячие новости - и вечные песни, отчужденность и родство. Если ты разделил с кем-то простое-человеческое, почувствовал то общее, что лежит за различиями - более вероятным становится  понимание, не схватка...

I’m Valeriy Klamm, photograher based in
Novosibirsk, Russia. I invite you to dive into the reality of Siberia, to ‘meet’
my neighbours (thousands of miles away, but that's not so far, right?) ... It's cordiality and paradoxes of habitual moments, unpolished details
of existence. It's a gallery of simple heroes in simple circumstances: women and men coming
through ages, shaman and theater director, babushka and pilot, fostered girls and
plumber - their fates beyond faces.  Open this door: my photo book ‘The Siberians’. 
***
Я Валерий Кламм, фотограф из Новосибирска. Приглашаю вас погрузиться в реальность Сибири, познакомиться с моими соседями (тысяча вёрст не крюк ?)) ... Сердечность и парадоксы обыденного, шершавые детали бытия. Простые герои в простых обстоятельствах: мужчины и женщины в их возрастах-времени, шаман и режиссер, бабушка и летчик, приемная дочка и водопроводчик - и судьбы, что стоят за лицами.  Откройте эту дверь: моя фотокнига ‘Сибиряки’. 
About / О проекте

Since late 2009 I’ve run the photoblog community ‘Birthmarks On the Map’ - BOM (in Russian – ‘Rodinki Na Karte’) - devoted to Russian
provinces and focused on inhabitants of little towns and villages. This project, at first supported by local partners, now exists as
my own independent initiative without
resources. Yet it has also grown, having gone 'offline' with group and solo printed shows & multimedia presentations in my region and abroad (Australia, Cambodia, Sweden, Canada, China)... Besides my short intro video above - here is a longer one, a sort of trance ...
***
С конца 2009 года я веду коллективный фотоблог ‘Родинки на карте’ (РНК), посвященный российской провинции, жителям деревень и малых городов. Этот проект, на старте поддержанный местными партнерами, ныне существует как моя частная, независимая инициатива, без опоры на чьи-либо ресурсы. По мере роста и развития, Родинки вышли в оффлайн групповыми и сольными выставками, мультимедиа-показами, в моем регионе и вне России (Австралия, Камбоджа, Швеция, Канада, Китай)... Кроме моего короткого вводного видео - посмотрите вот это, подлиннее, некий транс ... ЗАГОВОР: ""хор"" фотографов-участников Родинок - и музыкантов 


WATCH  & MEDITATE  -  'INCANTATION' , 'Birthmarks On the Map' clip: 'CHORUS' OF PHOTOGRAPHERS-CONTRIBUTORS (Valeriy Klamm, Alexander Sorin, Ksenia Diodorova, Andrey Kobylko, Fyodor Telkov, Sergey Maximishin, Alexander Kuznetzov, Alexander Stepanenko, Alexander Kustov, Tatyana Plotnikova, Igor Lagunov, Emil Gataullin) AND MUSICIANS (track by Sergey Starostin, Sainkho Namchylak, Molla Silla, Arkadiy Shilkloper, Vladimir Volkov, Pavel Fait) 
I assembled my ‘The Siberians’ book: 1st dummy  in 2012, 2nd version self-published offset in
2013 in Novosibirsk (offset, Rus-Eng bi-lingual texts and captions, available also in pdf via Blurb.com and for in Print-On-Demand on Amazon - see pictures below). 
***
Стала складываться моя личная тема и книга -  ""Сибиряки"": 1й макет сделан в 2012-м, 2я версия напечатана оффсетом в Новосибирске в 2013-м (с текстами-подписями в русско-английской билингве, доступна через Блюрб и Амазон - картинки см ниже) 





Now my works from the 'Birthmarks' blog and 'The Siberians' archive are being showcased in
our main national gallery – the Tretyakov (‘Metageography’ contemporary art group
exhibition showing until February 2016), and a large 'Birthmarks' team show is scheduled for May 2016 in Moscow – its first project appearance in
Russia's capital. So, the quiet voice of provincial
photo chronicles is becoming audible. What started as a local project has grown
into a comprehensive visual archive of Russian rural life as a whole, joining a universal & international ‘territory of humanity’ (though Birthmark speaks only Russian so far)... Now the aim is to spread these chronicles to a
wider audience outside Russia and the Russian language.

Сейчас мои работы - из ""Родинок"" и из архива Сибиряков -  участвуют в выставке современного искусства ""Метагеография"" на площадке главной галереи страны - Третьяковки; большая командная экспозиция ""Родинок"" будет в мае 2016го показана в Москве - премьера проекта в российских столицах  . Тихие голоса провинциальных фотохроник становятся слышнее. Локальная инициатива превращается во впечатляющий визуальный архив жизни российской глубинки в целом, универсальную и вненациональную ""территорию человечности"" (хотя Родинки пока говорят только по-русски)... И цель моя сейчас - поделиться сделанным с широкой аудиторией, выйти за рамки страны и языка. 
My needs and your perks / Что мне нужно и что предлагаю взамен
I need support to cover expenses for design-editing and offset printing of my latest bookThe Siberians: Rurality, with a publication in Spring 2016. On one hand, it summarizes my works in a new re-edited and re-designed unit. On the other hand it is an item within a series to be continued - transmedia stream under 'The Siberians' umbrella (books, multimedia, webdocs, travelling exhibitions). In return for your help, you'll get wide
range of perks from our cellar... 
**Мне нужна ваша поддержка, чтобы покрыть расходы на подготовку (дизайн, верстка) и оффсетный тираж моей новой фотокниги ""Сибиряки: Глубинка"", со сроком публикации весной 2016. С одной стороны, это подводит итог моей работе, объединяя архив на новом уровне: иной отбор, редизайн. С другой стороны, это часть продолжающейся серии, трансмедийного потока в общем русле ""Сибиряков"" (книги, мультимедиа, вебдоки, передвижные выставки). Взамен за вашу помощь могу предложить широкий выбор подарков из нашего погребка... 
First ($ 5), you can be mentioned in the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT section
of the new book + you get the prior
version of 'The Siberians' - e-book_v2 in PDF (early delivery - right after payment* before campaign ends)
Or you can receive:
- 3 SIGNED POSTCARD ($ 10) of some of the images
in the book (free delivery, before campaign ends)
- A SIGNED PRINT, 20X30 ($ 20, free shipping) cm OR 30X45 cm ($ 20 + shipping)
- The main reward - NEW BOOK ($ 30 + shipping) v3 - 'The Siberians; Rurality' ultimate re-edited version, 156 pages, photos along with texts (Rus-Eng bi-lingual), Offset Printing, softcover.
- $ 1000 : perks above + A PHOTO EXPEDITION TO WESTERN
SIBERIA (your 1-week route within Novosibirsk, Omsk, Tomsk regions or Altay from Biysk to Mongolia border
according to your preferences)
***
Прежде всего (5 долларов), вы можете быть упомянуты в разделе благодарностей новой книги + получить книгу версии 2013 в pdf (до окончания кампании, в кратчайшие сроки после оплаты)
Или вы можете получить:

- 3 ПОДПИСАННЫХ АВТОРОМ ОТКРЫТКИ (10 долларов, бесплатная доставка) с фотографиями из книги (бесплатная отправка - до окончания кампании - февраль)
- ПОДПИСАННЫЕ АВТОРОМ ПРИНТЫ 20X30 см (15 долларов, бесплатная доставка) ИЛИ 30X45 cм (20 долларов + доставка) 
- Главный мой встречный подарок - НОВАЯ КНИГА v3 - 'Сибиряки: Глубинка', итоговая версия, 156 страниц, фото и тексты (билингва - русский и английский), оффсет, мягкая обложка - (30 долларов + доставка) 
- 1000 долларов : все вышеперечисленные подарки  + ФОТОЭКСПЕДИЦИЯ В ЗАПАДНУЮ СИБИРЬ (ваше недельное путешествие в компании со мной в качестве гида и помощника по Новосибирской, Омской, Томской областям или Алтаю (от Бийска до Монголии) - в соответствии с вашими предпочтениями **** расходы на ваши билеты и проживание на маршруте не включены)  



And above all, you could become an ANGEL OF THE
PROJECT, under whose wings 'Birthmarks on the Map' will keep existing and expanding ($4000 : All of the perks listed above + your name or logo on 'The Siberians: Rurality"" cover, to be mentioned at all public presentations and acknowledged on top of BOM blog homepage for one year after the campaign end) 
***
Кроме того, вы можете стать АНГЕЛОМ ПРОЕКТА, под чьим крылом 'Родинки на карте' будут жить и развиваться  (4000 долларов : все перечисленные выше вознаграждения + ваше имя или логотип на обложке новой книги и домашней странице блога, упоминания на всех показах и презентациях) 




Any extra money from The
Siberians: Rurality camaign above the goal will help me to develop my projects. 
Деньги, которые кампания ""Сибиряки: Глубинка"" сможет собрать сверх ожидаемой суммы, поможет мне дальше развивать проект. 

Risks  / Риски 

The images are essentially shot and ready
to go (with the exception of some last-minute fortunate snaps I may have the
chance to capture) and a reliable designer
and publisher are available in my city and ready to work hard... Zero-risk
***
Фотографии в основном сделаны и готовы к началу сборки (хотя отбор может быть дополнен чем-то снятым в последний момент), надежный дизайнер и типография - рядом, в моем городе, готовы к тяжелой работе. Риск=ноль




I chose flexible funding because I don't want to wait up to 30 days for PayPal verification (Indiegogo's reqirement for fixed funding). If I don't achieve the campaign goal of
$4000, supporters
who invested in the NEW BOOK will be rewarded with a copy made via quality Print-On-Demand format (Blurb) or entirely refunded upon their
request. All other project
intentions will be fulfilled
despite a lesser amount gathered. In case of success of my campaign the only risk for contributors can be a bit slow delivery of 'physical' perks: I'm going to use regular post service to avoid increasing shipping price ;)
***
Я выбрал ""гибкое финансирование"", потому что не готов был 30 дней ждать верификации PayPal (а этого требует IndieGoGo для ""фиксированной схемы""). Если я не достигну финансовой цели кампании в 4000 долларов, инвестировавшие в новую книгу получат ее в штучном исполнении ""печать-по-заказу"" класса Blurb или по их желанию я полностью верну их деньги.  Все другие мои обязательства перед поддержавшими меня будут выполнены и при меньшей сумме сборов. Единственный риск - небыстрая доставка ""физических подарков"": для снижения цены доставки будет использована обычная почта  ;)

FEEDBACK
""'The
Siberians' offers a tantalising visual insight into the traditions and culture
of people from this fascinating region of the world, beyond many of the
stereotypes and clichés often associated with Siberia; ""the coldest place
on earth"" and the place for political exile. It is contrastingly bursting with colour, warmth
and friendly familiarity""
Gabriela, UK
"".. this album is about a different  Russia – a
strange, unknown, a bit sad Russia where people are very much “on the ground”
but not denying life - even on the contrary - they all are very vivid and
lively, peering towards their life and their future.. Siberian people invest everything in their daily
life in order to survive and to create – to create another day, another piece
of art, another piece of beauty, another piece of bread. This is a difficult
place to live - the daily life there is certainly not easy. But the people
there have warm hearts; they can value the very little things they have...""

<h3>We are Naughty &amp; Nice Photography</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Three siblings working toward the same goal - to own our own photography studio. But not just any ol' photography studio. Though we will continue to do traditional photography - family, couples, baby and senior photos - we would love to pursue our creative spirit through adding custom Cosplay shoots. It's where our hearts lie and as the video above demonstrates, there are a lot of people who feel the same way.</p>
<h4> <i>What will make us unique is our approach to Cosplay shoots. If you don't already have your super, awesome Cosplay costumes on hand and ready to be photographed in, then this is -</i>
</h4>
<h2>How it will Work:</h2>
<h3>~ Dream It ~</h3>
<p>Do you have an idea for an awesome Cosplay, Renaissance Faire or Re-enactment costume? Or maybe you are a huge fan of a certain period in world history. Bring your idea to us. We can work together to create exactly what your imagination has cooked up.</p>
<h3>~ Be It ~</h3>
<p>Take your dream from imagination to reality. To that end we have contracted with a  dear friend who just happens to be a very talented and experienced seamstress. Her new company, Threads Through Time, will work with us FREE of charge to create your one of a kind costume for a photo shoot. We are also looking at bringing in someone to do hair/beauty makeup and possibly even someone for special FX makeup to give our clients a ONE OF A KIND photo shoot experience.</p>
<h3>~ Photograph It ~</h3>
<p>Once your final fittings have been accomplished, then we get to have fun. A photo shoot where you and your costume are the stars! It will be a fun filled afternoon of photography with the various poses and locations our team have cooked up for your specific shoot.</p>

<p><b>But what will happen to all of those glorious one of a kind costumes at the end of the photo session?</b></p>
<p><b></b>Don't worry, we've got that covered too! </p>
<p>There are three options.</p>
<p>1) From the outset, the client will decide if they want their costume custom created just for them with our purchase option. The purchase of the costume would mean that the costume will be created specifically for their measurements and in exactly the materials/colors they wish used. The purchase of the final product directly from us will cost less than if they bought it at the retail price.</p>
<p> If they choose not to purchase the costume, then one of the following will happen.</p>
<p>2) The costume may enter into our inventory. - We will guarantee that the costume will not be shot in the same way that it was used in the client's shoot, but we will reserve the right to use it in other ways.</p>
<p>3) The costume may be sold for the retail price via the Threads Through Time Etsy store front.</p>

Backdrops and support system. As much as we love using the great outdoors as our backdrops, a cold Upstate New York winter makes it uncomfortable and unpleasant for the models, not to mention our fingers! Besides, versatility is key.

No matter where we've gone, there has been one thing that has been there to see us through. We have each other.  We know each other's weaknesses and strengths. If one of us has trouble dealing with a situation, you can guarantee that one or the other of us will pick up the slack and keep the momentum moving forward. Besides, there is no substitute for hard work and a can-do attitude.


    Other Ways You Can Help: Share. Share. And most of all SHARE our campaign with others. Use the Indiegogo share tools to make it easy on yourself!
We can't do this alone!

</div><p>I have been a photographer and artist for over 10 years now and have loved sharing my vision with everyone. I love to blend every form of art and imagination into a unique style that draws attention and conversation. With a background in graphic design, I am able to blend different forms of art and everyday inspiration into my own vision. From sets to styling and makeup, I take on all aspects of making my art a reality. I put in as much of myself as possible into every portrait I create. As a freelance artist, I invest every extra cent into my art an photography. </p><p>Each photo goes through months of conceptualizing, prop selection, and searching  for the perfect personality and model to tell my story. I try to use as little digital manipulation as possible, but still create a surrealistic world for a perfect balance of old and new. I work tirelessly to collaborate with talent from all walks of life come up with the most original work  I can dream up. My work is inspired from normal everyday behavior, pop culture, technology, age, self-image, and sexuality. The characters introduce through work live in a very animated, colorful, and vibrant world. </p><p>So, why a campaign? Over the past few years, I have self-funded all my own projects and gallery shows. I’ve bought all my own equipment, sets, and anything that was needed to make my vision a reality. However, self-funding has limited my ability to spread my work beyond the limited Chicago niche market I have created. My campaign aims to bring art and fashion into countless hands and make it accessible to everyone. </p><p>All of the Nestor’s Photography T-shirt designs are made to be all inclusive and not limited to gender or body size.

<h3>Funding &amp; Perks! </h3> <p>The majority of the funding and support will used for actual printing and to produce enough product to actually make an impact on the market and consumers.

Too fat? Too thin? Too short? It is a constant struggle to maintain the concept of ‘beauty’.<br/><br/>In this book the Salty Girls challenge this norm, and strive to put an end to body shaming. NO MORE feeling embarrassed or ashamed of their bodies, The Salty Girls have now inspired other women with CF, from literally all around the world. They embrace their body’s scars and all, to inspire women everywhere to do the same. These women truly are the epitome of remarkable strength, enormous resilience, and unique beauty both inside and out. Not only is this book about raising awareness for Cystic Fibrosis, but it can truly reach all females who have ever felt this way.<br/><br/>Salty Girls is the logical evolution of my first book, Just Breathe, which focused on portraits of adults with Cystic Fibrosis. Around the same time I saw the photo of model Bethany Townsend, who suffers from Crohn’s disease, and another model with the skin disease vitiligo being interviewed by Tyra Banks. I thought it’s time for a model with CF. I know what these woman go through on a daily basis; everyday is a struggle living with CF. And, to the uninformed, it’s an invisible fatal disease. With this book it’s invisible no more.</div><div>

<strong>Cystic Fibrosis Explained</strong><br/>Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and digestive system. An inherited condition, CF affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become thick and sticky. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.</div><div>

These women truly are the epitome of remarkable strength, enormous resilience, and unique beauty both inside and out. Not only is this book about raising awareness for Cystic Fibrosis, but it can truly reach all females who have ever felt this way.Salty Girls is the logical evolution of my first book, Just Breathe, which focused on portraits of adults with Cystic Fibrosis. Around the same time I saw the photo of model Bethany Townsend, who suffers from Crohn’s disease, and another model with the skin disease vitiligo being interviewed by Tyra Banks. I thought it’s time for a model with CF. I know what these woman go through on a daily basis; everyday is a struggle living with CF. And, to the uninformed, it’s an invisible fatal disease. With this book it’s invisible no more.

The stories here are real and powerful. It’s the Salty Girls, in their own words. 77 women in total participated in the ground-breaking project. 


  

What We Need & What You Get The book is done and will be at the printers shortly. We are now offering these special deals to get both the BOOK and the SaltyGirls tank top , AS WELL as a hires PDF version of the book. The $5,000 we are trying to raise will get us over the goal line faster.





    The Impact 
Cystic Fibrosis ExplainedCystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and digestive system. An inherited condition, CF affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become thick and sticky. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.




   Risks & Challenges The book is DONE. After a year in the works we are almost ready to ship. There is almost ZERO risk, as we'll be going to print any day now. Delivery will be 100% guaranteed.

<p><strong>Why this project is needed:</strong></p>
<p>I'm Vanessa Perkins and I'm a professional Boudoir Photographer! I'm happily married with a beautiful daughter and twins on the way!</p>
<p>Throughout my photography career, I've had the privilege of seeing many women build their confidence and see how beautiful they are inside and out through their boudoir photoshoot experiences. </p>
<p>After moving to a new town in California, there are no shared photo studios that we can rent time slots from (like I have been doing my whole career) which is what leads us to our campaign!</p>
<p><strong>Opening A New Space:</strong></p>
<p>With your help we can reach our goal of $18,000, which will enable us to open our own photography studio! Here's what we plan on doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renting out our own space to turn into our phot studio!</li>
<li>Renovating</li>
<li>Furnishing</li>
<li>Decorating</li>
<li>Securing the space as safe environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course we hope to achieve our ultimate goal of $18,000, but if we are under our goal, we will use what funds we do achieve to first begin renting the space. From there, we will add on to the space as the funds come. Even small donations can go a long way!</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently in communication with and booking our 2021 women, who are looking to find an experience that will lift them and bring them the self love that they deserve! </p>
<p>Even during the pandemic this last year, we have been booking spots and seeing an influx of women come in for their shoots. We already have the demand, spaces have begun filling up! All we need now is the space.</p>
<p><strong>As a thank you for your donation:</strong></p>
<p>With your contributions, some perks we want to give are discounts off your own family, couples and boudoir shoots! Some educational videos about camera basics and posing. All photoshoots can be scheduled February-December 2021.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and donations! </p>

<h3>Introducing PBC by CDA-TEK</h3>
<p>The PBC is a pocket sized device that enables you to control and monitor the settings of your Blackmagic Pocket Cinema camera wirelessly over Bluetooth.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576186126/djlvt5fikvdosvpfkkor.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The two switches on the PBC have three operational modes ; Single click, double click and long click, each of which can have a different function assigned to them.</p>
<p>This flexibility means you can configure the PBC to switch between controlling up to six different settings on the camera including aperture, ISO, White Balance, Auto Focus, Auto Exposure and of course start stop of recording.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576186198/hgejdexuyhb6suzk2rhv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The current settings of the camera are displayed on the PBC's bright daylight readable screen which you can configure in any one of four different colour schemes. In addition the screen switches to red to provide a clear visual reference when the camera is recording.</p>
<p>From power on, the PBC connects to your camera in under 5 seconds and its large capacity internal rechargeable battery provides over five hours of continuous run time as well as being able to powered directly by USB.</p>
<p>Whilst the PBC is a small handheld device it can of course be mounted to a rig or gimbal or even the camera itself using a tripod adapter rail.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576186246/jhvwh4cy1odfnk5mbzlj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As well as offering direct control of the camera functionality itself, the PBC can also be used as a wireless interface hub to incorporate both the Tilta Nucleus Nano focus wheel and our own upcoming PXP expander module (*PXP expander module will be available before Q2 2020).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576186345/r9269yhwvfzn493ukaox.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With the Nucleus Nano wheel in Bluteooth mode, the PBC enables you to have focus control of native and adapted EF lenses on your camera with compatible adapters without requiring gears, motors or additional power as well as being able to start and stop recording. </p>
<p>As the PBC operates in tandem with the Nucleus Nano wheel, this combination offers you complete hands off control of the camera, something which is very beneficial when it is mounted on a gimbal.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576186450/vhmlecgqfjhsm1jgfthz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Using our PXP module you can also expand the possibilities of the PBC with an additional five assignable physical switches to directly control camera functions as well as an inbuilt focus control wheel. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576186405/n4he9xikc2o7a4wgxjys.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Whether you are using the Nucleus Nano wheel or own PXP to control focus, you are able to use the PBC to store two focus points and then use the focus limiter function to prevent overshooting when transitioning between them.</p>
<p>All of the PBC's settings and focus control functions are fully compatible with both the Blackmagic Pocket 4K and Pocket6K cameras.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The PBC is feature complete from a software and hardware perspective and we are now seeking funding purely for production rather than development.</p>
<p>We have 3 levels of pre-order perks, each with a different discount level from the retail price of the PBC as well as a discount on our next project, the accompanying PXP expander unit.</p>
<p>The first two tiers of pre-order (First Wave and Second Wave) are limited to the first 50 orders for each.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About CDA-TEK</h3>
<p>We are a small company based in Dublin, Ireland and specialise in developing custom camera control solutions.</p>
<p>Our 3C Android app was made available for sale in early 2019 and is a comprehensive remote control system for the Blackmagic Pocket4K Cinema Camera and has received several feature upgrades including the integration of the Tilta Nucleus Nano focus wheel.</p>
<p>3C will be shortly receive an update to enable it to be compatible with the Blackmagic Pocket6K Cinema Camera.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing PBC by CDA-TEK
The PBC is a pocket sized device that enables you to control and monitor the settings of your Blackmagic Pocket Cinema camera wirelessly over Bluetooth.

The two switches on the PBC have three operational modes ; Single click, double click and long click, each of which can have a different function assigned to them.
This flexibility means you can configure the PBC to switch between controlling up to six different settings on the camera including aperture, ISO, White Balance, Auto Focus, Auto Exposure and of course start stop of recording.

The current settings of the camera are displayed on the PBC's bright daylight readable screen which you can configure in any one of four different colour schemes. In addition the screen switches to red to provide a clear visual reference when the camera is recording.
From power on, the PBC connects to your camera in under 5 seconds and its large capacity internal rechargeable battery provides over five hours of continuous run time as well as being able to powered directly by USB.
Whilst the PBC is a small handheld device it can of course be mounted to a rig or gimbal or even the camera itself using a tripod adapter rail.

As well as offering direct control of the camera functionality itself, the PBC can also be used as a wireless interface hub to incorporate both the Tilta Nucleus Nano focus wheel and our own upcoming PXP expander module (*PXP expander module will be available before Q2 2020).

With the Nucleus Nano wheel in Bluteooth mode, the PBC enables you to have focus control of native and adapted EF lenses on your camera with compatible adapters without requiring gears, motors or additional power as well as being able to start and stop recording. 
As the PBC operates in tandem with the Nucleus Nano wheel, this combination offers you complete hands off control of the camera, something which is very beneficial when it is mounted on a gimbal.

Using our PXP module you can also expand the possibilities of the PBC with an additional five assignable physical switches to directly control camera functions as well as an inbuilt focus control wheel. 

Whether you are using the Nucleus Nano wheel or own PXP to control focus, you are able to use the PBC to store two focus points and then use the focus limiter function to prevent overshooting when transitioning between them.
All of the PBC's settings and focus control functions are fully compatible with both the Blackmagic Pocket 4K and Pocket6K cameras.

What We Need & What You Get
The PBC is feature complete from a software and hardware perspective and we are now seeking funding purely for production rather than development.
We have 3 levels of pre-order perks, each with a different discount level from the retail price of the PBC as well as a discount on our next project, the accompanying PXP expander unit.
The first two tiers of pre-order (First Wave and Second Wave) are limited to the first 50 orders for each.

About CDA-TEK
We are a small company based in Dublin, Ireland and specialise in developing custom camera control solutions.
Our 3C Android app was made available for sale in early 2019 and is a comprehensive remote control system for the Blackmagic Pocket4K Cinema Camera and has received several feature upgrades including the integration of the Tilta Nucleus Nano focus wheel.
3C will be shortly receive an update to enable it to be compatible with the Blackmagic Pocket6K Cinema Camera.
We have also shown a development version of an innovative LIDAR based continuous autofocus system that is highly anticipated by users of the Blackmagic Cinema Cameras.
The PBC will act as an interface hub between the camera and the LIDAR auto focus system.
Risks & Challenges

The PBC is feature complete from a software and hardware perspective so is a low risk project to support as the funding is purely for production of the units.
As with every project as it enters production, there may be unexpected challenges in terms of component supply and shipping delays from suppliers but as we do not have a reliance on a single supplier for any component, we are confident that this risk has been mitigated as much as possible,",6.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>This project aims to raise the finances needed for Craig to purchase the photographic equipment he needs and to open a photography studio in order to develop his photography business.  But more importantly, it is about giving Craig
the chance to put his life back on track. It is about helping him to reach a
position where he can support himself and his children without having to rely
on others on an ongoing basis.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2001 Craig was running an Internet and IT consulting
business in London when his wife, who was pregnant with their fourth child, became
sick. With the Dot Com bubble burst of the time, things were slow and he took
the decision to close the business down for a few months to help look after the
kids until the birth. Unfortunately, a week after the baby was born, his wife
was diagnosed with stomach cancer at the age of 36. Although she initially went
into remission after treatment, the cancer returned and she passed away in
early 2004 leaving him with four young children, then aged 9, 6, 3 and 1.</p>
<p>It was a blessing to have had the ability to be with his
family full-time during that period, but it wasn't long after she passed away
that finances meant he would have to shortly return to work. But with 3 years
out of the IT world everything had changed, making it difficult to return to the same profession. So, in the summer of 2004, he
decided to risk everything, sell the house and return to college to obtain a
masters degree as a route back to job market. He choose to do so here in Utah in the hope of providing his children with a fresh start,
and ended up studying for a Master of Business Administration with a supply
chain and strategy emphasis.</p>
<p>However, things didn't quite go according to plan. The sale
on his house in London, which had not been finalized when he moved out here,
ran into difficulties. When the sale finally completed, he was left with
approximately $50,000 less than anticipated. This meant that his funds ran out
long before he had finished the MBA. Gladly, with the help of the college and
others, a solution was found he and managed to graduate at the end of 2007, no easy feat for a single parent with young kids. </p>
<p>But that
wasn't the end of his problems, upon graduating his visa situation became messed
up and he was unable to legally work for almost a year. Also with no funds left
he was unable to afford to return to the UK and found himself in a very
difficult situation trying to survive with his growing family.</p>
<p>Again thanks to others, a solution to the visa problem was
found and he eventually began working for a startup company. Once more though,
things didn't go according to plan and less than two years later the company
ran out of funds and laid everyone off. Craig found himself, with little
experience in a new career path, approaching age 50 and in an economy still
struggling to recover. Despite a few promising early interviews, a new position
failed to materialize. As time progressed, interviews became less frequent,
until now, after almost 5 years out of the job market, he has become basically
unemployable. He has barely survived during that time through doing occasional
handyman jobs and by the good graces of others. As you can imagine this has
taken a hard toil on Craig and his children. </p>
<p>It was during this difficult time that Craig rediscovered an
old passion for photography. Finding a creative outlet through photography
provided a much needed way to reduce the stress that he was going through. But
more than that Craig realized that not only did he enjoy photography but that he
had the ability to be good at it. After much encouragement from others, Craig
started a photography business about a year and a half ago in the hope of it
eventually providing a way back to supporting his family while being able to
follow his passion. </p>
<p>However, being a photographer isn't cheap, and without the
proper equipment, difficult to succeed in the commercial and art worlds where
his photography interests lie. As you might imagine, given the difficulty of
the past few year, Craig is not in a position on his own to raise the finances
he needs to move forward. It is because of this that he has turned to crowd funding
in a hope to raised the needed funds. And that is where you come in. He hopes,
that through your generous support and contributions, he might obtain the
assistance he needs to once more become self-reliant and be able to provide a
future for his children.</p>
<p></p> </div>
<div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Craig's plan is to not only upgrade his equipment, needed to provide the quality of images required for his area of work, but to open a photography studio. The studio will not only be utilized for his own photography but will be open for the use of other photographers in the area that lack their own studio space. It is anticipated that the income received from studio memberships and rentals will not only cover the ongoing overheads, but provide a means to continue investing in the studio.</p>
<p>The funds needed cover a number of categories, the breakdown of which is illustrated in the following chart.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1406597/files/20150422120503-CrowdFundBreakdown.jpg?1429729503"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>

<p>The biggest risk to the project is not reaching the targeted amount. If this is to occur there are various approaches that could be taken. The first is to substantially reduce the scope of the project. The first priority needs to be the upgraded camera equipment, followed by some lighting equipment. Once these items have been met, then we will evaluate the balance of funds and what is still possible. If the shortfall isn't too substantial then it may be possible to raise bank financing to bridge the deficit. </p>
<h4>Failure To Find Suitable Location</h4>
<p>The aim is to ideally find premises in the Provo/Orem area that offers natural light. However, locations with natural light can be much more difficult to find and tends to be a little more expensive. If natural light is not possible then a location without natural light will be sought. We are confident that there are sufficient vacant premises in the area that finding something quickly should not be difficult.</p>
<h4>Insufficient Interest From Other Photographers</h4>
<p>The business model for the studio is based on being able to find sufficient photographers in the area willing to buy into studio membership, or who wish to rent on an hourly basis. Currently there is only one other studio in the area appearing to offer space to other photographers, and they tend to have a waiting list. There certainly have been numerous photographers expressing interest in studio space but that doesn't always translate to those willing to pay for such.</p>
<p>In the event that sufficient numbers are not found, then the ongoing shortfall will need to be made up by an increase in photography clients. The project takes into account sufficient funds to operate on a three month basis while building up the membership and clients.</p>

struggling to recover. Despite a few promising early interviews, a new position
failed to materialize. As time progressed, interviews became less frequent,
until now, after almost 5 years out of the job market, he has become basically
unemployable. He has barely survived during that time through doing occasional
handyman jobs and by the good graces of others. As you can imagine this has
taken a hard toil on Craig and his children. 
It was during this difficult time that Craig rediscovered an
old passion for photography. Finding a creative outlet through photography
provided a much needed way to reduce the stress that he was going through. But
more than that Craig realized that not only did he enjoy photography but that he
had the ability to be good at it. After much encouragement from others, Craig
started a photography business about a year and a half ago in the hope of it
eventually providing a way back to supporting his family while being able to
follow his passion. 
However, being a photographer isn't cheap, and without the
proper equipment, difficult to succeed in the commercial and art worlds where
his photography interests lie. As you might imagine, given the difficulty of
the past few year, Craig is not in a position on his own to raise the finances
he needs to move forward. It is because of this that he has turned to crowd funding
in a hope to raised the needed funds. And that is where you come in. He hopes,
that through your generous support and contributions, he might obtain the
assistance he needs to once more become self-reliant and be able to provide a
future for his children.
 
 What We Need & What You Get Craig's plan is to not only upgrade his equipment, needed to provide the quality of images required for his area of work, but to open a photography studio. The studio will not only be utilized for his own photography but will be open for the use of other photographers in the area that lack their own studio space. It is anticipated that the income received from studio memberships and rentals will not only cover the ongoing overheads, but provide a means to continue investing in the studio.
The funds needed cover a number of categories, the breakdown of which is illustrated in the following chart.

The Impact
 Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges Insufficient Funds Raised
The biggest risk to the project is not reaching the targeted amount. If this is to occur there are various approaches that could be taken. The first is to substantially reduce the scope of the project. The first priority needs to be the upgraded camera equipment, followed by some lighting equipment. Once these items have been met, then we will evaluate the balance of funds and what is still possible. If the shortfall isn't too substantial then it may be possible to raise bank financing to bridge the deficit. 
Failure To Find Suitable Location
The aim is to ideally find premises in the Provo/Orem area that offers natural light. However, locations with natural light can be much more difficult to find and tends to be a little more expensive. If natural light is not possible then a location without natural light will be sought. We are confident that there are sufficient vacant premises in the area that finding something quickly should not be difficult.
Insufficient Interest From Other Photographers
The business model for the studio is based on being able to find sufficient photographers in the area willing to buy into studio membership, or who wish to rent on an hourly basis. Currently there is only one other studio in the area appearing to offer space to other photographers, and they tend to have a waiting list. There certainly have been numerous photographers expressing interest in studio space but that doesn't always translate to those willing to pay for such.
In the event that sufficient numbers are not found, then the ongoing shortfall will need to be made up by an increase in photography clients. The project takes into account sufficient funds to operate on a three month basis while building up the membership and clients.
    Other Ways You Can Help Whether you are able to financially contribute or not, your help in spreading the word about this campaign would be much appreciated. The more people hear about it, the better the chances of reaching the target. Remember to utilize the share tools Indiegogo provides.

<p>We strongly believe that our goal of $6,000 is attainable through our CLICK! Campaign. However, with all crowd funding campaigns there is always a chance of not reaching the projected goal. We have taken this into careful consideration. Our approach would be as follows:</p>

What Is The Plan?


We strongly believe that our goal of $6,000 is attainable through our CLICK! Campaign. However, with all crowd funding campaigns there is always a chance of not reaching the projected goal. We have taken this into careful consideration. Our approach would be as follows:



Through our contacts and connections we would reach out directly to individuals and businesses for additional support.

If necessary, we would scale back costs to the best of our ability, not sacrificing quality of our print material. 
Please note that our campaign does not require us to reach our goal in order to receive funding. Under no circumstances would those who donated be denied their Perks. All Perks will be fulfilled. 
All businesses that received Full and Major Sponsorship Status will have their logo printed on the official CLICK! Triangle Photography Festival Program, regardless of whether our campaign reaches its goal.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>My name is Lisa Missenda; I am a Fine Art Photographer. Throughout my life, I have always been fascinated with how things are connected, especially when, on the surface, they seem to be so different. It is interesting to untangle how one moment in time has expanded beyond its origin. By tracing these moments, we can identify how that single moment influenced another moment and created a series of events in history. This coming April, I have a rare opportunity to visit the cradle of monotheism on a trip to Turkey, Greece, and Italy. In a world divided by our ideologies, this will be an incredible opportunity to explore the origins of faith and ideas. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>I will capture moments that speak to this theme in Istanbul, Ephesus, Patmos, Crete, Athens, Corinth, Pompeii and Rome. By combining my detailed daily journal and a carefully curated selection of photographs, I will create a unique Fine Art photo book that charts the journey of Monotheism in the ancient world, all through the eye and heart of a modern mystic.  </p>

</div></div>","Animosity is a new book by Aaron Gekoski

The world's wildlife is in 'catastrophic decline' due to the activities of mankind. Wildlife populations have fallen by more than two-thirds in less than 50 years, according to a major report by the conversation group WWF.
Help us create a vital new book, Animosity, which through the images of environmental photojournalist, Aaron Gekoski, shows us how wild animals are being exploited, tragically used as tourist attractions or for domestic pets, and consumed and traded to the point of extinction. It is a book that needs to be seen to be believed!

A Unique Photographic Journey
Aaron, aka 'Bertie' to his friends, has spent the past decade documenting human-animal conflict. He has won numerous awards for his photography including the coveted Wildlife Photographer of the Year and Nature Photographer of the Year competitions.
Royalties from the book will go directly towards photographic investigations that expose animal welfare issues.
 




 






 
What We Need & What You Get

To produce a book of this quality is expensive. The design and print costs of the standard and limited edition versions will exceed £10,000.
Royalties from the book will go directly to Aaron to enable him to continue his pioneering work around the world bringing the plight of abused animals to the attention of people who care.



Not only can pledgers receive early copies of the standard book, they can also buy a signed and numbered exclusive limited edition as well as signed limited edition prints.
The ultimate reward is to interview Aaron on a one-to-one basis via an audio visual call about his career, working practices and ambitions.


The Impact

The publication of this book will help raise awareness around the world of a number of key conservation issues.

Issues covered include Wildlife Tourism, marine conservation, otters and the exotic pet trade,  shark finning, seal culling, Cambodia's dog meat trade, the township dogs of Cape Town, West Africa's Voodoo markets, training as a wildlife ranger, Madagascar's tortoise mafia, and more.
Our previous track record in book production (we are seasoned producers of books like this with our last books being on Orangutan Rescue and the Last Dance (Dancing Bears of India)) will ensure the project is produced on time and to budget.
Your support will ensure this book is published and more people become aware of the issues raised, which will be even more important in a post Covid 19 world.

<p>Help fund ""PHOTOGRAPHY IS POETRY"": 2020 Traveling Show by purchasing an art zine, a print or booking one-on-one Q&amp;A chat session with artist Angelika Ejtel alias RapidHeartMovement. Every dollar helps bring this project to life, no contribution is too small.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>It's I, Angelika Ejtel, self-portrait artist, photography and poetry lover, lost soul. I created this campaign  because I need your help to fund this year's traveling show of mine including 5 juried arts festivals; three of them being ranked #1, #3 and #9 in the 10 TOP ARTS FESTIVALS in the U.S.! This is the best selection I've ever achieved within last 3 years since I started applying to arts festivals in 2017. I decided to make an effort (physical and financial), and travel to expand the exposure of my work. </p>
<p>The main goal of this campaign is to raise funds to help me upgrade my unprofessional (read crappy) setup of the booth to a professional level as well as cover the cost of traveling and lodging:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% of the funding will be used for purchasing pro-panels booth setup and a tent</li>
<li>30% of the funding will be used to cover the travel and lodging expenses</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Please, after backing, refer to my <a href=""https://rapidheartmovement-104174.square.site/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online store</a> to choose a print you'd like to have either from my Limited Editions or Collector's Editions, and e-mail me your selection at angelika.ejtel@gmail.com so I can book it for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>Your contribution to this campaign will enable me to continue sharing my work at art fairs in the U.S. and perhaps inspire a larger audience to find beauty in poetry through the visual language my images speak.</p></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's always challenging to showcase your work at art fairs because of inclement weather. In a blink of an eye your art can get damage due to the rain, strong winds or tornado. Having a professional setup, waterproof tent and proper weights could save you a lot of trouble.  If my campaign is not at least 70% funded, I might be at the risk of using my old unprofessional setup, which I wouldn't like anymore.</p>

<h3>How it all started...</h3>
<p>It all began on a random spring day in 2009 in Edmonton. My husband, my best friend and I decided to check out the new Humane Society building and love up some dogs. We weren't expecting to adopt but then we looked in a room and saw Walter. He was 8 wks old, sitting there all by himself, staring at the floor and looking rather sad. I went in and he crawled in my lap and kissed my chin. That was that. He was coming home with us. The following year we adopted scruffy little Rupert (actually Rupert adopted my husband by running over and sitting on his foot) and my journey with the camera began. I have always loved photography, but it wasn't until I started capturing the shananigans of my two furry mischief makers that I knew what I was meant to do, I am at my happiest when I'm laying in the dirt with my camera and a bunch of dogs are running towards me at full speed! All animals have such distinct personalities and I love capturing that through my camera. Throughout the years I've been teaching myself everything I can about photography and have grown so much. In 2013 I won the I shot it Dog photography contest. I've also been published a variety of international photography magazines such as Popular Photography, Photography Monthly (Walter made the cover of this one!) and Digital Camera World. A photo I took of Rupert has been licensed to a British greeting card company as part of their Christmas lineup.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What I need to get started</h3>
<p>In order for me to start my pet photography business I need a few upgrades. I currently own a Canon T3i. It's been a wonderful little camera but it's getting sluggish. It's low light capability isn't very good and the frames per second are slow. This means I'm limited with what I can do and there are situations where it doesn't allow me to achieve my vision. I would like to get a 5d mkiii full frame camera bundled with the 24-105 lens. This new tool would allow me to take my photography to the next level. I would also like to upgrade my computer. I currently edit on my lap top so I need a much faster desk top with a color calibrated monitor. I'm asking for $5750 cad which will cover the costs of both. If I surpass my goal, I will put the additional funds toward a 70-200 2.8 zoom lens. If I don't achieve my goal, anything raised will be put toward the cost of the camera.</p>

<p>If you decide to help me out on my happy, fur filled photographic adventure I'll be offering a variety of perks. They'll start at $10 for a Wally &amp; Roops postcard up to $350 for a pet photo shoot package.</p>

<p>Taking a business to the next level has it's challenges but luckily I have a great support circle and I know talented photographers I can talk to and ask for advice. I can't wait to see what transpires over the next few months as I get everything going. It's all very exciting!</p>

<div>
<p><i>Lilith: From Myth To Flesh</i> was born from our desire to explore alternative narratives of femininity that pose a threat to the patriarchal status quo.  We feel the time has come to experience, through photography and performance, the intentionally-concealed story of Lilith, first wife of Adam, the feminine shadow.  Lilith was created of the same earth as Adam, and by right should have been considered his equal.  It was decided for both Lilith and Adam that she should be diminished, and Adam's dominion over nature and Lilith was established. Adam attempted to assert his dominance. Indignant, Lilith chose to flee the Garden of Eden rather than be stripped of her own determination.  Alone in the wilderness, she raged and suffered.  It is through this suffering that she is transformed into her true self.  Lilith's story tells us that it is the dark times, represented by the dark phase of the Moon, which are times of incubation, creativity, and transformation.  </p>
<p>We are exploring Lilith's journey from human to goddess through a 5-part photographic series which, once completed, will be shown at an opening event on the weekend of October 23rd at Trans Pecos, Queens, NYC.  In this series, we will approximate Lilith's suffering by undergoing hook suspension and temporary subdermal implantation.  These trials of the flesh allow us to <span>open a timeless space, where we can access truths about our nature and our history.  These trials were not chosen frivolously; they allow us to present Lilith's story in a way which visually recalls her ordeals. Beyond this, body suspension and personal sacrifice appear in many of the mythologies around the world, which speaks to a greater universal significance.  We feel that photographic documentation of these trials will communicate Lilith's story in a way no written or spoken language possibly could.</span></p>
<p>We are opening our bodies, literally and metaphorically, to share the teachings of Lilith.  </p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>In order to complete this photo series, we are enlisting the help of several specialists.  We will be working with a suspension crew, a body modification artist, a wardrobe stylist, makeup artists, and a graphic designer.  Beyond that, we are also printing these photos using analog techniques, which necessitates experimentation with different darkroom papers, as well as different chemicals.  Already, this series is underway.  We have completed the first of four photo shoots, which depicted the birth of Lilith, as well as her conflict with Adam, and utilized rope suspension.  We are well in the planning stages for the rest of our shoots.  The second will be our hook suspension shoot, where Lilith flies to her cave.  The third is our subdermal implant shoot, depicting Lilith suffering in her solitude.  The last will show Lilith emerging from her cave as transformed into goddess.  Our amazing stylist, <a href=""http://www.numiempire.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Numi Empire</a>, has put together a mood board for the final shoot in the series, and is making a completely custom headpiece and costume for Luna to wear during the final shoot.</p>

<p>Lilith's journey follows the classic arc of a resurrection myth.  What makes her narrative particularly compelling is that her journey is an act of insubordination against a patriarchal god who would have her diminish herself for the sake of Adam.  This same patriarchal god is the one whose decrees have shaped western thought, and whose ""morals"" permeate our contemporary culture.  Trying to confine Lilith in simplistic categories or morals is a foolish effort; she easily defies the conventions into which we've been indoctrinated.</p>
<p>Lilith's story is one of defiance and sacred pain.  She can be found in those who don't live their lives in gilded shackles, who experience all of the suffering associated with living authentically in a society constantly exerting pressure, constantly trying to mold and bend the individual to fit neatly into a predetermined category. </p>
<p>We hope that this project will encourage dialogue about our most shrouded nature.  We strive to learn collectively of a new approach to understanding ourselves, as well as to coexisting without dominance.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> There are real risks involved with these physical practices. Examples of this are abundant. There is a risk of infection, temporary or permanent physical impairment, death; the realities of pushing the boundaries of the flesh. Neither of us, photographer and conduit,  are new to these practices. We both have several years of experience, research, and practice. We have enlisted collaborators who are highly regarded in their field of specialization. These collaborators were chosen on the basis of their knowledge, and practice, of sanitation and sterilization alongside their tenure dedicated to their particular craft. You will get to know more about them and their practice as the campaign progresses.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>Undoubtably this project requires a lot of sacrifice from everyone involved, from the time involved in making this a reality to the physical demands of each part of the series. Please bear in mind that signs of this series will be etched into someone's skin for a long time. </p>

</div></div>","Statement of Intent

Lilith: From Myth To Flesh was born from our desire to explore alternative narratives of femininity that pose a threat to the patriarchal status quo.  We feel the time has come to experience, through photography and performance, the intentionally-concealed story of Lilith, first wife of Adam, the feminine shadow.  Lilith was created of the same earth as Adam, and by right should have been considered his equal.  It was decided for both Lilith and Adam that she should be diminished, and Adam's dominion over nature and Lilith was established. Adam attempted to assert his dominance. Indignant, Lilith chose to flee the Garden of Eden rather than be stripped of her own determination.  Alone in the wilderness, she raged and suffered.  It is through this suffering that she is transformed into her true self.  Lilith's story tells us that it is the dark times, represented by the dark phase of the Moon, which are times of incubation, creativity, and transformation.  
We are exploring Lilith's journey from human to goddess through a 5-part photographic series which, once completed, will be shown at an opening event on the weekend of October 23rd at Trans Pecos, Queens, NYC.  In this series, we will approximate Lilith's suffering by undergoing hook suspension and temporary subdermal implantation.  These trials of the flesh allow us to open a timeless space, where we can access truths about our nature and our history.  These trials were not chosen frivolously; they allow us to present Lilith's story in a way which visually recalls her ordeals. Beyond this, body suspension and personal sacrifice appear in many of the mythologies around the world, which speaks to a greater universal significance.  We feel that photographic documentation of these trials will communicate Lilith's story in a way no written or spoken language possibly could.
We are opening our bodies, literally and metaphorically, to share the teachings of Lilith.  
   What We Need In order to complete this photo series, we are enlisting the help of several specialists.  We will be working with a suspension crew, a body modification artist, a wardrobe stylist, makeup artists, and a graphic designer.  Beyond that, we are also printing these photos using analog techniques, which necessitates experimentation with different darkroom papers, as well as different chemicals.  Already, this series is underway.  We have completed the first of four photo shoots, which depicted the birth of Lilith, as well as her conflict with Adam, and utilized rope suspension.  We are well in the planning stages for the rest of our shoots.  The second will be our hook suspension shoot, where Lilith flies to her cave.  The third is our subdermal implant shoot, depicting Lilith suffering in her solitude.  The last will show Lilith emerging from her cave as transformed into goddess.  Our amazing stylist, Numi Empire, has put together a mood board for the final shoot in the series, and is making a completely custom headpiece and costume for Luna to wear during the final shoot.


Your contribution goes directly towards:


Hooks
Medical supplies
Sculptural implants
Shoot location rental

Custom wardrobe

Transportation for collaborators
5x7 and 11x14 darkroom papers
Darkroom chemicals
Picture framing
Performance venue


What You GetOur rewards are largely dependent on how the rest of the shoots turn out, as we've currently only photographed a portion of this series.  Therefore, many will be unavailable until the series has been completed.  
One reward which will be available immediately upon the completion of this fundraiser is the $10 reward tier, which is a small vial containing earth and herbs.  It can be wire-wrapped and turned into a pendant, should you desire it.


Some other perks which will be available before the series is completed are the hooks and the ""polaroid"" (Fuji instant film, technically).  These will be sent out by end-of-august. 

An example of an instant film picture, as well as a sterilized flesh-hook (not for re-use)
Additionally, our tote bags and tshirts will be made available once this fundraiser has finished.

A test-print of a tote bag, in order to see how colors and contrast would reproduce.
The final tote bag design, by Dorothy Schmidt.

Black and white version of Dorothy Schmidt's design, for tshirtsOtherwise, the perks will have to fulfilled once the whole series is photographed and printed.  However, from our first shoot, we have several examples of what 5x7 test prints might look like:

An experiment with layering negatives.  Printed onto Ilford Warmtone Multigrade paper, using Ethol LPD liquid developer.

We hope that this project will encourage dialogue about our most shrouded nature.  We strive to learn collectively of a new approach to understanding ourselves, as well as to coexisting without dominance.   Risks & Challenges  There are real risks involved with these physical practices. Examples of this are abundant. There is a risk of infection, temporary or permanent physical impairment, death; the realities of pushing the boundaries of the flesh. Neither of us, photographer and conduit,  are new to these practices. We both have several years of experience, research, and practice. We have enlisted collaborators who are highly regarded in their field of specialization. These collaborators were chosen on the basis of their knowledge, and practice, of sanitation and sterilization alongside their tenure dedicated to their particular craft. You will get to know more about them and their practice as the campaign progresses.
Undoubtably this project requires a lot of sacrifice from everyone involved, from the time involved in making this a reality to the physical demands of each part of the series. Please bear in mind that signs of this series will be etched into someone's skin for a long time.

</div></div>","This project is meant to increase population health by reminding people how important it is to consume more fruits and vegetables every day.     Who am I?               My name is Gabriela Beszkai and I am a final year medical student. I spend all of my little free time photographing and reading.                                          Why am I doing this?            Being a passionate medical student but also a passionate photographer, I’ve been searching for a project that would allow me to link these two, to create something beautiful but inspiring and life changing, too. So I thought about the great opportunity of health promotion through my photography. I want to enable people to increase control over their health and to improve it, by making them aware of all the benefits an increased consumption of fruit and vegetable can bring.       Insufficient fruit&vegetables consumption and obesity are among the major causes of cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes and cancers.     What am I doing...              I made a research on the beneficial effects that some foods have on different organs, that might help prevent diseases and thus improve overall health. I studied the eyes, the brain, lungs, heart, liver, pancreas, digestive tract, kidneys and bones and found that specific foods have important effects on these organs, helping us to prevent diseases and keeping them healthy. I gathered all this information and used those specific vegetables, fruits, spices, nutseeds or herbs to recreate human organs and their functional elements.                  Let's take for example, this picture of the lungs recreated out of vegetables. Studies say that including onions, chilli/ CH-19 peppers, cruciferous (especially broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower), ginger, olives, red bell pepper, garlic, duck leaves, spinach and mushrooms in our diet could improve our lung function and prevent infections, asthma and most important, cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide in men and the second-commonest cause in women.           Moreover, the reconstruction respects the anatomical features, describing structural and functional elements of the organs, just like you can see in these pictures:
 
 

                                                                 The Kidneys
 

                 The Nephron: the urine-producing functional structures of the kidney
 
 
 At least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of overweight or obesity.
             Globally, 42 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2013. They are likely to become obese adults and to develop diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age, which in turn are associated with a higher chance of premature death and disability. More than 1.9 billion adults are overweight and more than half a billion are obese, and the numbers are rapidly increasing. This is why preventing obesity from an early age has become a major public health priority in the developed world. 
   Low fat intake and an increased consumption of fruit and vegetables is strongly associated with wight loss and weight maintenance. 
                A well balanced diet, together with regular physical activity, is one of the most significant factors that determine your health. Fruit and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet, and their sufficient daily consumption could help prevent major diseases such as: obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer.                        As part of a healthy diet low in fat, sugars and sodium, WHO suggests consuming more than 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day to improve overall health and reduce the risk of certain diseases. 

 
 
How can you help?
 
           After months of reasearch, I spent a whole week just to make a plan for recreating the human lungs. Then I started to set up studio lights, buy the materials I needed, the fruits and vegetables, washed, sliced and arranged, piece by piece, everything I've used in those photographs.
 

 
 
          But all this turned out to be pretty expensive and I rapidly ran out of budget. This is the reason why I'm here on Indiegogo. I need your financial support in order to recreate the other 7 systems,  with all their specific healthy foods and provide further information. Help me to raise awareness about all the benefits of an increased fruit and vegetable consumption through my photography! 
 

          Familiarity strongly influences young children’s food preferences, so early childhood is a crucial time for interventions. Their habits will set the foundation for their lifestyle and risk of disease as adults. Encourage your children and grandchildren to learn anatomy in an interactive way, looking at photographs that catch their eye and make them link our organism with fresh, healthy foods. 
 
          Be a promoter of a healthier lifestyle and make your friends and loved ones aware of all the benefits an increased fruit and vegetable intake can bring!
 

Up to 1.7 million lives could potentially be saved each year if fruit and vegetable consumption were sufficiently increased. (www.who.int)

<p>
</p><p>The 48
States project is a solo road trip to photograph federally designated
wilderness areas and National Wildlife Refuges in the lower 48
states. A book featuring the best photos from the trip, a website
with info on places visited and an exhibit will be produced at the
end.<br/><br/>To make fundraising and budgeting easier I'll be doing the project in stages. First up is the Southeast from Virginia to Florida and then back up towards Kentucky and West Virginia. </p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY DO IT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wildlands in the United States are under constant attack by corporate and political interests from mountaintop removal mining in the Appalachians to tar sands oil extraction in the Midwest and wetlands loss due to dredging and canals in the gulf states. I believe it's
important to show the beauty of these places before they finally get their way and destroy the land
and lock the public out of using them for recreation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1407175/files/20150422154654-20120418-_MKM7572-Edit-9.jpg?1429742814"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>WHY NOT 50 STATES?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply
because of the expense. I would love to add Alaska and Hawaii to the
project but that would almost double the cost. If this is successful
hopefully I can add them in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO WHAT DOES THE MONEY GO TO?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost a

will go towards fees and reward fulfillment and the final third will
be for food and travel expenses. Other than some random camping gear
I have most of what I need as far as equipment goes. The fundraiser
won't be the only source of money for the trip but it won't happen
without it. Any
money left over at the end will either go towards making a better
exhibit or adding pages to the book.<br/>I'm using Indiegogo's
flexible funding option which means even if I don't raise the full
amount I still get whatever is raised just at a higher fee. If I do
come in under the goal I'll just reduce the number of states visited
initially and try to add them in later. If I only raise 50 dollars
well I guess I can go on an overnight trip near my home and still
deliver at least a nice photo to you.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1407177/files/20150422154744-MKM_7718-26.jpg?1429742864"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>
</p><p>I'm Kent
Moore. A Roanoke, Virginia based photographer. The last few years
I've mostly been photographing abandoned buildings and places from
Ohio to New Orleans to South Carolina. Over the years though I've
probably best been known for documenting the local punk rock music
scene. Most of my published work has been of those photos. I've
self-published two books so far so I know the process of doing

<p>
</p><p>WHAT DO I GET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set
the perks up so you get a physical product at all designated levels.
None of those “I'll give you a high five” or just a thanks on a
web page most people won't click on. Of course I'll still give you a
high 5 and a thanks no matter how much you contribute but an actual
print you can hang on the wall is a bit better I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GENESIS</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've
been sitting on and dreaming about an adventure like this for about
17 years. It started when I read Earth Odyssey by Mark Hertsgaard. In
it he went around the world to 19 countries reporting on various
environmental crises. I'm not a reporter or a writer so it was hard
to come up with a similar plan that would still tell a story. I am a
photographer though and eventually started coming up with a plan to
tell an environmental story through photos. I've kicked around
several ideas that would have taken me to the Amazon jungle, the
forests of Vietnam among other exotic locales. Those ideas were
discarded for various reasons, complexity, time constraints, costs,
etc. I may come back to them in the future if things work out right.
More recently I started thinking that maybe I should do something
closer to home. Of course once I started brainstorming it it grew to
still a fairly complex and expensive undertaking. Since it's all
contained to one country though it will be much easier to pull off. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY RISKS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yeah.
The biggest will be potential vehicle problems. From flat tires to
the engine blowing up to getting broadsided by a moose almost
anything is possible when you plan on driving in the 13-15,000 mile
range. I plan on putting full insurance coverage and a roadside
assistance plan on the vehicle to reduce the hassles of any thing
like that that arises.</p>
<p>Another
is health issues. Most of the east coast portion should be pretty
simple but for parts of the west coast and Rocky Mountains I'll be
out in the woods or desert for weeks at a time. Since I’ll be solo
in some rugged and remote places I will be a bit more cautious than I
might be if I was with friends here in the Blue Ridge. A simple task
like crossing a creek can turn dangerous really fast if you get
reckless.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1407180/files/20150422154929-MKM_7714-Edit-25.jpg?1429742969"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>I'M BROKE CAN I STILL HELP? 

<p>
</p><p>Definitely.
Please share this page with your friends and network. I'm also
accepting sponsorships. Anything from camping or photo gear to cans
of food I'll accept and list you on the sponsors page. Please contact
me with any ideas you have for that, no matter how insignificant it
might seem it could be a huge help.</p>

the engine blowing up to getting broadsided by a moose almost
anything is possible when you plan on driving in the 13-15,000 mile
range. I plan on putting full insurance coverage and a roadside
assistance plan on the vehicle to reduce the hassles of any thing
like that that arises.
Another
is health issues. Most of the east coast portion should be pretty
simple but for parts of the west coast and Rocky Mountains I'll be
out in the woods or desert for weeks at a time. Since I’ll be solo
in some rugged and remote places I will be a bit more cautious than I
might be if I was with friends here in the Blue Ridge. A simple task
like crossing a creek can turn dangerous really fast if you get
reckless.I'M BROKE CAN I STILL HELP? 


Definitely.
Please share this page with your friends and network. I'm also
accepting sponsorships. Anything from camping or photo gear to cans
of food I'll accept and list you on the sponsors page. Please contact
me with any ideas you have for that, no matter how insignificant it
might seem it could be a huge help.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>That event
was the catalyst for me to undertake and embark upon a 7000 mile photographic
odyssey – <i>East Coast: Arctic to Tropic</i>.
These images place this extraordinary yet fragile coastline in an environmental

precarious relationship to the sea yet we observe a stunningly beautiful

contain 330 pages with 188 photographs.

earthquakes and volcanoes are the ongoing threat as the powerful forces of
tectonic plates grinding and crashing into one another create the breathtaking

fuels, carbon dioxide levels increase, greenhouse gases are trapped, temperatures warm, ice
melts, the oceans rise. </p>
<p>It is a

<p>The reality
of global warming is evidenced by retreating ice all over the world. I saw it

melting Greenland Ice Sheet. A complete melt of the ice cap would add 22 feet
to sea levels worldwide. And that excludes the melting Antarctic.</p>
<p>Our
predicament is our own doing, an undoing is a monumental challenge when there
is political opposition to nature’s reality for purely ideological reasons and
when science is purposefully ignored. </p>
<p>Human beings
can be clever, resourceful, and ingenious. The challenge is whether or not we
can harness and master our skills and use new technologies and policies in a

<h3><strong>About the book</strong></h3>
<p>As a visual artist I can only say I am blessed to be born in Romania.  In my country almost everything is a picture, I do not have to search for images, I just live my life and pictures happen. Actually the more I live my life the better my images get.  People here have a specific quality, a sort of external image of poverty mixed in together with profound internal abundance and creativity. A wonderful balance of roughness and sensibility. It all just comes together  naturally, like an old pair of shoes you’ve worn thousands of times, they look worn out but their your favorite pair, their comfortable, and then there’s all the memories you have together, places you’ve been, people you’ve met. You look at them and they make you smile.</p>
<p>Family pictures work the same way, there is the picture, the actual physical photograph and then there is the memory attached to it, the metaphysical or spiritual side of the image. My approach to photography is similar to the family snapshot but somehow it is the opposite, I already have the memory and I am now searching or rather waiting for the memory to manifest itself. The result is strangely familiar.</p>
<h3><strong>The dream</strong></h3>
<p>Publishing a book of my photographs has been a creative dream of mine for many years. I believe a photobook is the best and most intimate way you can experience photography. I feel my images are all about intimacy and so the best way to enjoy them will be in a wonderfully printed photobook.</p>
<p>Please consider supporting the production and printing of my photobook, your contributions will help my images get out into the world.</p>

<h3><strong>Technical stuff</strong></h3>

<li>All the images are scanned and calibrated, ready for printing.</li>
<li>I have the final selection and the sequence of the images made.</li>
<li>I wrote a small essay for the book and had my artist friends help me with the book design and the illustrations for the cover.</li>
<li>I made a dummy book just to see how the book will physically work and if I need to change anything.</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The things you are passionate about are not random,</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>they are your calling.</i>This quote is one of my favorites, because I'm living it.  </h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">15 Years ago someone close to me asked me a question that would forever change my course in this life.  The question was ""If you could do this for a living would you?""  My heart said yes, but the rest of the world started to says no to these types of paths.  If it wasn't for someone taking a moment, realizing I had a gift that should be shared, and pushing me to pursue it, I would be on a very different path. I can feel it in my soul that this path I'm along is where I""m meant to be.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is why I believe in following your passions in this life, and having a place that will cultivate a creative community.</p>
<p>My name is Carrie Stadelman and I'm a Certified Professional and Master Photographer .</p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign will help make the dream of having a place for not only Freeland Photography Portraiture, but a place for creatives, young artists and women entrepreneurs to get a sense of community and support. To build a foundation in pursuing the paths less taken, and fulfilling the purpose we have in this life.</li>
<li>Having a place to bring artists, creatives, and entrepreneurs together to lean on one another and support each other is the main goal.  I love finding new talent and helping them bring it into the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a list of things I want this place to be and this is only just the beginning. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>A PLACE TO START</h3>
<p>This campaign will help me finalize the work that needs to be done to get the studio ready for portraiture and community.  Getting new lights for the ceiling that are LED and promote better lighting for photos and video.  New Equipment to help run the studio better, as well as construction items to finish off different spaces.  Furniture will be added so when events take place here, we have a place for discussion and togetherness. Being able to get this done will help me launch the different projects for our community sooner. Also new signage for the front of the building and doors, as well as out front so the public knows where we are!</p>

<h2><strong>YOUNG ARTIST RECEPTION.</strong></h2>
<p>My first project is to host a quarterly young artist reception to show the community a new and emerging artist or entrepreneur.  This can be someone who does anything that isn't the ""normal"" path.  I want to help showcase these artists so they can start finding their passions and have them lead into their purpose.  No longer should they hide away their talents and not know what it feels like to be appreciated and accepted.  Knowing they can use these talents in their life and careers will help them carve our their niche in the future.</p>

<h3>BACKER REWARDS....THE GOODIES!</h3>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","The things you are passionate about are not random,

they are your calling.This quote is one of my favorites, because I'm living it.  
15 Years ago someone close to me asked me a question that would forever change my course in this life.  The question was ""If you could do this for a living would you?""  My heart said yes, but the rest of the world started to says no to these types of paths.  If it wasn't for someone taking a moment, realizing I had a gift that should be shared, and pushing me to pursue it, I would be on a very different path. I can feel it in my soul that this path I'm along is where I""m meant to be.
This is why I believe in following your passions in this life, and having a place that will cultivate a creative community.
My name is Carrie Stadelman and I'm a Certified Professional and Master Photographer .

This campaign will help make the dream of having a place for not only Freeland Photography Portraiture, but a place for creatives, young artists and women entrepreneurs to get a sense of community and support. To build a foundation in pursuing the paths less taken, and fulfilling the purpose we have in this life.
Having a place to bring artists, creatives, and entrepreneurs together to lean on one another and support each other is the main goal.  I love finding new talent and helping them bring it into the world.

I have a list of things I want this place to be and this is only just the beginning. 

 
A PLACE TO START
This campaign will help me finalize the work that needs to be done to get the studio ready for portraiture and community.  Getting new lights for the ceiling that are LED and promote better lighting for photos and video.  New Equipment to help run the studio better, as well as construction items to finish off different spaces.  Furniture will be added so when events take place here, we have a place for discussion and togetherness. Being able to get this done will help me launch the different projects for our community sooner. Also new signage for the front of the building and doors, as well as out front so the public knows where we are!

YOUNG ARTIST RECEPTION.
My first project is to host a quarterly young artist reception to show the community a new and emerging artist or entrepreneur.  This can be someone who does anything that isn't the ""normal"" path.  I want to help showcase these artists so they can start finding their passions and have them lead into their purpose.  No longer should they hide away their talents and not know what it feels like to be appreciated and accepted.  Knowing they can use these talents in their life and careers will help them carve our their niche in the future.
 
BACKER REWARDS....THE GOODIES!
 
I love a good behind the scenes, so you will be able to get a first look at our studio as it changes and grows through our social media and newsletter.  Having the pride to know you personally made this dream come true is a great reward, but I know you want some good stuff.  Take a look at what our perks are and make your selection now!

 
The Impact
By becoming a backer, you will help not just build my dream, but those who find solace in this community and creative space:

I want people to know that it is ok to pursue their passions and gifts in this life.
Helping others in the community is something that makes my heart happy. In partnership with the Cascades Humane Society, We have done a Calendar Contest for 9 years which has raised over $30,000 dollars in fundraising dollars for CHS in just one year.  
When you donate to our campaign, it's not just our studio that advances, it will be all those who think they can't make their dream a reality that will benefit.

<h3>The First 100 Days of Activism</h3>
<p>Since taking office on January 20, Donald Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders that clawed back progress on women's reproductive rights, effectively banned Muslims from enering the United States, and reversed important environmental protections. His proposed ""hard power"" budget shreds vital programs and begins the dismantling of whole sections of government. And despite setbacks, the Republican administration continues to advanced on its promise to repeal Obamacare with replacement legislation that de-funds Planned Parenthood and leaves millions without healthcare. All the while, his fledgling administration is mired in controversy. </p>
<p>It's little wonder, then, that this president has drawn citizens to the streets, to airports, to town hall meetings to raise our voices in opposition to his dangerous policies. And at every rally and protest, we bring signs. <strong>Beautiful, outrageous, poignant, and pointed signs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The First 100 Days: Activism in a Divided America </strong>catalogs those signs and the stories behind them. Citizen Activists are invited to share their photographs to be collected in a coffee-table-style book with two purposes: to honor the forceful, peaceful engagement of Americans of every color and stripe as they make their voices heard, and to raise funds for the programs and organizations gutted by Trump's cruel agenda. Currently, we are planning two editions: The Women's Health Edition supports Planned Parenthood and other community health initiatives. The Arts and Science Edition funds arts and environmental education organizations. </p>
<p>All profits raised through this campaign will directly benefit organizations that provide critical services, advocacy and education for communities that are at-risk by the Trump administration's heartless budget priorities. Organizations that will benefit from this project include:</p>

</div></div>","The First 100 Days of Activism
Since taking office on January 20, Donald Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders that clawed back progress on women's reproductive rights, effectively banned Muslims from enering the United States, and reversed important environmental protections. His proposed ""hard power"" budget shreds vital programs and begins the dismantling of whole sections of government. And despite setbacks, the Republican administration continues to advanced on its promise to repeal Obamacare with replacement legislation that de-funds Planned Parenthood and leaves millions without healthcare. All the while, his fledgling administration is mired in controversy. 
It's little wonder, then, that this president has drawn citizens to the streets, to airports, to town hall meetings to raise our voices in opposition to his dangerous policies. And at every rally and protest, we bring signs. Beautiful, outrageous, poignant, and pointed signs.
The First 100 Days: Activism in a Divided America catalogs those signs and the stories behind them. Citizen Activists are invited to share their photographs to be collected in a coffee-table-style book with two purposes: to honor the forceful, peaceful engagement of Americans of every color and stripe as they make their voices heard, and to raise funds for the programs and organizations gutted by Trump's cruel agenda. Currently, we are planning two editions: The Women's Health Edition supports Planned Parenthood and other community health initiatives. The Arts and Science Edition funds arts and environmental education organizations. 
All profits raised through this campaign will directly benefit organizations that provide critical services, advocacy and education for communities that are at-risk by the Trump administration's heartless budget priorities. Organizations that will benefit from this project include:

Planned Parenthood
The Environmental Defense Fund
The National Guild for Community Arts Education

By contributing to this campaign, you become an activist in your own right, showing your support for the people, program,s and issues that our current government deems unimportant.
The First 100 Days of Activism Project is curated by journalist and photographer Chris Shipley. You are invited to submit your photos and stories to be considered for inclusion on the First 100 Days website and/or one of its print editions.
The postcards, art photos, and books produced by this campaign are of the highest quality at the most reasonable cost so that 100% of the profit goes to the organizations doing great work in communities across America. 

We've set a minimum target of $25,000, and we hope, through your generosity, we can do even more for these fine non-profits.

<p><strong>AUNTY! </strong>is the first show of its kind.  Featuring the earliest colonial images of African women to the contemporary, it represents the complete arc of 150 years of photo image making on the continent, The exhibition constitutes an uncovering of the beauty of African women and their worlds within fractured and layered colonial histories, and also in the collaborative, honorific spaces of African-owned studios. </p>
<p>The Ghana exhibition, is a historic return, and an opportunity for Ghanaians and the many travelers marking 2019 as the The Year of Return, to view these images in context. Some of the women featured in images at Independence celebrations, or in the kinds of 1950s-1970s nightclubs made iconic by photographers like <strong>Seydou Keita</strong> and <strong>Malick Sidibe </strong>will be present at the exhibition.  And the works of these two famed photographers will be present too, alongside ones from the earliest African and European studios, vernacular images by unknown camera artists, and the ground-breaking photography of contemporary African women--historically absent until post-Independence--and men. </p>
<p>Digging into history and offering a glimpse of a future narrative, the show features some 100 archival, vintage and contemporary photographs from <strong>The McKinley Collection,</strong> a trove of photographic prints, cartes de visite and postcards spanning the African continent. As <strong>Remi Onabanjo </strong>comments for <strong>The New York Times, Aunty!</strong> ""exalts [African women's] beauty on their own terms.""  She recognizes, ""With these early images included alongside modern and contemporary works, you’re really getting a full sweep of time and a subversive perspective on how to investigate the history of photography, through its relation tied to black African women as subjects. It also hints at the future, where more women of African descent are placed as curators, conservators and historians of the archive,” she explained. “This is a groundswell moment, showing that the medium isn’t just for the ‘modern masters’ of documentary photography, but also is embedded in a larger geographical scope of circulation and production, of subjects and individuals.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""In the process of doing their work, photographers inevitably generate archives.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m seeking support to self-publish a book called <i><strong>Unpacked Box</strong></i>, a project featuring newly published photographic works from James Luckett and Rebecca Holbrook-Erhart, and an insightful essay by Ray Klimek. This project develops the potential meanings of photo-images and their changes over time, and gives space for the artist/viewer interpretation.</p>
<p>Who makes an image, and what happens to the leftover, draft, mistaken, and forgotten images for a project over time? Who views the image, who owns the right to give the image meaning, and in what way do our personal images speak to larger concerns about historical context, social and cultural movements, and our human place within larger geographic space, geologic and myth-time. These are questions I keep asking as I work through this book project.</p>
<p>My goal: A thoughtfully curated book which begins with a single question: </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What do artist's unused images mean now?</strong></p>

<p>Artists of the Unpacked Box</p>
<h3>Rebecca Holbrook-Erhart</h3>
<p>Kentucky, born and raised. Relocated to the Chicagoland area from Eastern KY and Southeastern OH in Summer 2013. Her work rests on the power of the photograph to document both the familial and familiar, and in doing so, to reveal our subjective, interior interpretations of the images we make, keep, and tell. This work is difficult, emotionally fraught stuff lying just beneath the veneer of everyday places and things.</p>
<p>One project I want to share here is Rebecca's expansive project <a href=""http://rebeccaholbrook.net/section/387870-The-Promise.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Promise</a>, a powerful book of images and texts dealing with loss, passages of time, memories, and traveling bodies through the lens of recorded and archived personal moments. This book keeps a heavy story, making available the variety of detail often lost in the wake of family change, and personal grief. These details crystalize with time: phone calls, shared meals, hotel stays, arguments, and family gatherings become part of the complex ground upon which we all tell our stories, and make her personal narrative a universal one. </p>
<p>Rebecca has an M.F.A. in Photography and Integrated Media is from Ohio University, and an <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>M.A. in Art from </span>Marshall University, and for the last few years has worked on staff at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>James Luckett</h3>
<p>Working for over twenty years in art and photography and exhibited nationally, James Luckett has an M.F.A. from the University of Arizona, worked as a master printer in a forensic photography lab and taught award winning photography classes in Tucson and Chicago. A recipient of a 2011 Ohio Arts Council Individual Excellence Award, James is also a master of soups, salads, comfort food, and a super star baker of breads in Yellow Springs, Ohio.</p>
<p>His self published 2009 photography book <a href=""http://www.blurb.com/b/2129056-suginami"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>Suginami</strong></i></a>, an exploration of the ways the landscape layers in the edges of a frame and of the space of discovery between the viewfinder and the eye, was developed from daily walks through the neighborhood where he lived in Tokyo at the time.  Sheila Newberry writes about it in <a href=""https://sheilanewbery.wordpress.com/2010/08/14/why-i-like-suginami/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Walks through Suginami</a>, and Stacy Platt in <a href=""http://the-space-in-between.com/2009/01/14/one-thing-done-two-ways-elijah-gowin-and-james-luckett-on-making-a-book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Thing Done Two Ways</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you too have encountered this artist's work at Wittenberg University, The University of Arizona Museum of Art, Kenyon College, Newcastle University, or the Photographic Center Northwest, among many others. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>James was born in Stuttgart and, following the pleasures of living and working in Olympia, Tokyo and Ann Arbor, has settled his studio and darkroom in Springfield, Ohio. His interests and exploits are detailed on his long- running, ever-evolving, always-accumulating website, Consumptive.org, and here— </span><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/consumptive/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>@consumptive</a><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>.</span></p>

<h3>Ray Klimek</h3>
<p>I met Ray at Ohio University in Athens in 2012. Ray's work addresses landscape and place-making through the lens of history and fantasy. His depth and breadth of literary and art historical knowledge is overwhelming, at any point in a given conversation he will connect an artist's choice of material or method to the work of a little known poet, a crime novel character, a fleeting image in a jazz documentary, or the sounds coming through a studio window.</p>
<p>Ray has an M.F.A. in Photography and an M.A. in English Literature from Rutgers University, and has staged solo exhibitions of his work at Unsmoke Systems Artspace (Braddock, PA), Stevenson Gallery at Ohio University (Chillicothe, OH), the ARC Gallery (Chicago, IL), Marietta College Gallery (Marietta, OH), Roy G Biv Gallery (Columbus, OH), Zobole Gallery (South Wales, UK), Sordoni Gallery (Wilkes-Barre, PA),and the GPF Gallery (South Wales, UK). </p>
<p>Ray is the 2013 Ohio University Research Council Grant recipient, was awarded a 2004 International Center of Photography-The Tierney Family Foundation Grant, and a 2003 Teaneck, NJ Grant from The Puffin Foundation. His teaching straddles studio arts, art history &amp; theory, film, and literary courses, reaching back decades at variety of institutions.</p>
<p>His writings expand the conversation outward from the visual, comparisons and metaphor spiraling out toward an ever reaching horizon line. His essay <a href=""http://rayklimek.com/artwork/3648572_How_the_Light_Gets_In.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>How the Light Gets In: Notes on James Benning’s Ten Skies</i></a>, cemented my interest in making space in this project for his writing.</p>

<p><strong>Book Design/Layout:</strong> I am thrilled to work with a top notch graphic designer and friend, <a href=""https://qingwang.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Qing Wang</a>, to take my rough book design and make it shine.

<p>Publishing is a tool for asking questions, a way to collaborate with others, and is becoming part of my own artistic studio practice. The book as form can challenge artists to re-examine old images, and re-consider time and context in thinking about the meanings of photographs.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is two fold.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions and support is essential to make this project happen. It's not simply a matter of money. Ask most every artist, they'll willingly tell you that money is important, but social support, meaningful advocacy, and standing with those who are making important work is invaluable. This artist book project is unique in that it balances focus on three individual artists making highly interesting work in their own right, in various forms, some visual and some textual.</p>
<p>Your backing helps each of the works in this book reach a wider audience, and acts as a vote for the endless hours each artist spends making, building, gathering, and editing bodies of work.</p>
<p>Your contribution also brands the leftovers from each project in archived folders, boxes, binders, and hard drives, as potentially meaningful secondary, and tertiary projects worth considering. </p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Books are everywhere, connecting with book buyers is tough, and most of all, publishing is expensive. I believe in the value of this project. I know that by working together with others interested in artist projects, we can create a book with lasting value, doing justice to the words and images on the page.</p>
</div>

""In the process of doing their work, photographers inevitably generate archives. These two photographers think their way with and through the things of a world that is aloof yet simultaneously available to our perceptions, our curiosity, and our projections."" — Ray Klimek
 
Short Summary
I’m seeking support to self-publish a book called Unpacked Box, a project featuring newly published photographic works from James Luckett and Rebecca Holbrook-Erhart, and an insightful essay by Ray Klimek. This project develops the potential meanings of photo-images and their changes over time, and gives space for the artist/viewer interpretation.
Who makes an image, and what happens to the leftover, draft, mistaken, and forgotten images for a project over time? Who views the image, who owns the right to give the image meaning, and in what way do our personal images speak to larger concerns about historical context, social and cultural movements, and our human place within larger geographic space, geologic and myth-time. These are questions I keep asking as I work through this book project.
My goal: A thoughtfully curated book which begins with a single question: 
What do artist's unused images mean now?

Artists of the Unpacked Box
Rebecca Holbrook-Erhart
Kentucky, born and raised. Relocated to the Chicagoland area from Eastern KY and Southeastern OH in Summer 2013. Her work rests on the power of the photograph to document both the familial and familiar, and in doing so, to reveal our subjective, interior interpretations of the images we make, keep, and tell. This work is difficult, emotionally fraught stuff lying just beneath the veneer of everyday places and things.
One project I want to share here is Rebecca's expansive project The Promise, a powerful book of images and texts dealing with loss, passages of time, memories, and traveling bodies through the lens of recorded and archived personal moments. This book keeps a heavy story, making available the variety of detail often lost in the wake of family change, and personal grief. These details crystalize with time: phone calls, shared meals, hotel stays, arguments, and family gatherings become part of the complex ground upon which we all tell our stories, and make her personal narrative a universal one. 
Rebecca has an M.F.A. in Photography and Integrated Media is from Ohio University, and an M.A. in Art from Marshall University, and for the last few years has worked on staff at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.
 
James Luckett
Working for over twenty years in art and photography and exhibited nationally, James Luckett has an M.F.A. from the University of Arizona, worked as a master printer in a forensic photography lab and taught award winning photography classes in Tucson and Chicago. A recipient of a 2011 Ohio Arts Council Individual Excellence Award, James is also a master of soups, salads, comfort food, and a super star baker of breads in Yellow Springs, Ohio.
His self published 2009 photography book Suginami, an exploration of the ways the landscape layers in the edges of a frame and of the space of discovery between the viewfinder and the eye, was developed from daily walks through the neighborhood where he lived in Tokyo at the time.  Sheila Newberry writes about it in Walks through Suginami, and Stacy Platt in One Thing Done Two Ways.
Perhaps you too have encountered this artist's work at Wittenberg University, The University of Arizona Museum of Art, Kenyon College, Newcastle University, or the Photographic Center Northwest, among many others. 
James was born in Stuttgart and, following the pleasures of living and working in Olympia, Tokyo and Ann Arbor, has settled his studio and darkroom in Springfield, Ohio. His interests and exploits are detailed on his long- running, ever-evolving, always-accumulating website, Consumptive.org, and here— @consumptive.
 
Ray Klimek
I met Ray at Ohio University in Athens in 2012. Ray's work addresses landscape and place-making through the lens of history and fantasy. His depth and breadth of literary and art historical knowledge is overwhelming, at any point in a given conversation he will connect an artist's choice of material or method to the work of a little known poet, a crime novel character, a fleeting image in a jazz documentary, or the sounds coming through a studio window.
Ray has an M.F.A. in Photography and an M.A. in English Literature from Rutgers University, and has staged solo exhibitions of his work at Unsmoke Systems Artspace (Braddock, PA), Stevenson Gallery at Ohio University (Chillicothe, OH), the ARC Gallery (Chicago, IL), Marietta College Gallery (Marietta, OH), Roy G Biv Gallery (Columbus, OH), Zobole Gallery (South Wales, UK), Sordoni Gallery (Wilkes-Barre, PA),and the GPF Gallery (South Wales, UK). 
Ray is the 2013 Ohio University Research Council Grant recipient, was awarded a 2004 International Center of Photography-The Tierney Family Foundation Grant, and a 2003 Teaneck, NJ Grant from The Puffin Foundation. His teaching straddles studio arts, art history & theory, film, and literary courses, reaching back decades at variety of institutions.
His writings expand the conversation outward from the visual, comparisons and metaphor spiraling out toward an ever reaching horizon line. His essay How the Light Gets In: Notes on James Benning’s Ten Skies, cemented my interest in making space in this project for his writing.

Book Design/Layout: I am thrilled to work with a top notch graphic designer and friend, Qing Wang, to take my rough book design and make it shine. Her input and thoughtful approach to design, font choices, and layout cannot be overstated.
Please consider supporting these artists—every contribution is helpful!

Publishing is a tool for asking questions, a way to collaborate with others, and is becoming part of my own artistic studio practice. The book as form can challenge artists to re-examine old images, and re-consider time and context in thinking about the meanings of photographs.
 
What We Need & What You Get
What we need is two fold.
FIRST, we need your monetary support, at any level. This helps us get from designed concept to bound & finished book. Unpacked Box is about 80% completed, the design files will undergo one final round of review with the designer, before we are prepared to contract with a book printing house to begin printing proofs. This means we will be able to turn around a finished book very quickly from the time we meet out funding goals.
SECOND, we need you to share this project with as many people as possible on Facebook, and Instagram. Every share helps, and is greatly appreciated!
 
Cost Breakdown:
This campaign goal is $3,600 which will provide needed funds to accomplish the follow:
$2,900: Printing and shipping 250 copies of the 8""x8"" hardbound book
$300: Compensation for my kind and generous graphic designer
$250: Additional shipping costs for delivery to campaign supporters
$250: Shipping, postage, marketing campaign materials for distributing books to libraries, bookstores, and potential collections

Total costs—$3,700
​Book launch event/marketing costs to be determined by success of this campaign



Perks:


Featured perk: For just $75—receive a copy of the book, Unpacked Box, signed by all featured artists combined, with your name in the recognition page of the book. 
Donors to this campaign can get a copy of the finished book for $25— Until August 1st!  After August 1st, pre-orders will be $30.
Check out the perks sections for the rest!Contingency plans:

If we do not meet our funding goal, but we can raise at least 75%, we will adjust the total size of the print run down to the largest number in our capacity (est. 100 copies) 
If we raise at least 50% of our goal, we will adjust the printing materials, and total number of copies to meet a small-run contract of 50 copies, and use this as leverage to propose funding and granting opportunities for a larger run in the future.

The Impact
Your contributions and support is essential to make this project happen. It's not simply a matter of money. Ask most every artist, they'll willingly tell you that money is important, but social support, meaningful advocacy, and standing with those who are making important work is invaluable. This artist book project is unique in that it balances focus on three individual artists making highly interesting work in their own right, in various forms, some visual and some textual.
Your backing helps each of the works in this book reach a wider audience, and acts as a vote for the endless hours each artist spends making, building, gathering, and editing bodies of work.
Your contribution also brands the leftovers from each project in archived folders, boxes, binders, and hard drives, as potentially meaningful secondary, and tertiary projects worth considering. 

 

Challenges
Books are everywhere, connecting with book buyers is tough, and most of all, publishing is expensive. I believe in the value of this project. I know that by working together with others interested in artist projects, we can create a book with lasting value, doing justice to the words and images on the page.


Distribution is a challenge— we are developing a strategy to get this book into the hands of book sellers, librarians, curators, and art and photo book collectors over the next 6 months. We can always use your help!

The world of breastfeeding support is under a lot of pressure and there have been many cuts to breastfeeding support services. In a UNICEF Baby Friendly survey, more than half of areas in England were reporting cuts to breastfeeding groups and cuts to children centre services. Nearly 60% reported cuts of front-line health visiting services (source: <a href=""https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/cuts-that-cost/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNICEF</a>).</p><p>We want to expand the positive reaction that came from our previous public awareness campaign and enable a more expanded project not only through the photography and a short film but also to mobilise something much bigger.</p><p>Our goal for this campaign is <strong>£10,000</strong> and this is to cover Agatha’s and Robert’s travel, meal and accommodation costs while shooting in <strong>Bristol</strong>, <strong>Barrow</strong>, <strong>Cardiff</strong>, <strong>Cambridge</strong>, <strong>Glasgow</strong> and <strong>Manchester</strong>. </p><p>The <strong>photographs</strong> will be taken using analogue cameras and shot on <strong>35mm film</strong> and a short <strong>documentary</strong> will be developed alongside.

Be the change you want to see and show your support!</p><p>If we exceed our goal, any additional funds will go directly to the ABM to help them in their work of training mothers to support other mothers with breastfeeding, so that more families can breastfeed their babies for as long as they want to.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p><p>This campaign is not about expecting every mother to breastfeed, but we want everyone to have a choice. This isn’t about wanting 100% of families to breastfeed, it’s about making sure that all the people who want to breastfeed feel like they can. We want families to have a choice, rather than being let down by a lack of support – both breastfeeding support and support from society.</p><p>In the UK, we don’t all feel entirely comfortable with breastfeeding out and about. Every single time we see a mother breastfeeding, whether in real life or just an image, it helps to normalise what should be entirely normal. It helps the next woman we see in the cafe or on the train. It helps the little girl who may not breastfeed for another 20 years. It makes a difference. It’s no exaggeration to say this project will have an impact that could change lives.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550504625/wbelb4tviiyxjm6kfji5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our previous campaign was featured on billboards across London</i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>PEOPLE BEHIND THIS PROJECT</strong></p><p><strong>Agatha A.

We want families to have a choice, rather than being let down by a lack of support – both breastfeeding support and support from society.In the UK, we don’t all feel entirely comfortable with breastfeeding out and about. Every single time we see a mother breastfeeding, whether in real life or just an image, it helps to normalise what should be entirely normal. It helps the next woman we see in the cafe or on the train. It helps the little girl who may not breastfeed for another 20 years. It makes a difference. It’s no exaggeration to say this project will have an impact that could change lives. Our previous campaign was featured on billboards across London  PEOPLE BEHIND THIS PROJECTAgatha A. Nitecka, co-founder of RÅN studioAgatha has collaborated with award-winning directors, actors and production companies and has shot exclusively on 35mm film for Universal Studios, BBC Films, Working Title, Film4, The Bureau and many others. She has photographed among others many award winning actors including Eddie Redmayne, Saoirse Ronan, Ben Whishaw, Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams, Ian McKellen, Laura Linney, Robert Pattinson, Alicia Vikander, Amber Heard, Charlotte Rampling, Tom Courtney. And has worked with award winning directors including Andrea Arnold, Joanna Hogg, Clio Barnard, Tom Hooper, Andrew Haigh, Francis Lee and Sebastián Lelio.She is also an ambassador for the AllBright Academy, which helps women gain the skills, confidence and network needed to achieve their career goals.Some of Agatha’s film set work is available for sale when you support the project. Agatha’s work is not often available for sale so do make sure you grab this opportunity!You can find her full film credits on the IMDb page here.  Robert Appleton, co-founder of RÅN studioRobert graduated with a degree in Filmmaking from Manchester School of Art. Last year he  additionally studied film editing at the internationally renowned National Film and Television School based in London. He has successfully worked with London Design Festival, City York Council, South East Makers Club and University of the Arts London, as well as shot additional EPK content for film productions. Throughout his creative career Robert has worked on several social projects maintaining a desire to create content for social change and good.For the past few years he has been working closely with councils helping the departments for special educational needs. The content he creates clearly communicates policy and council initiatives while making sure that the voices of council workers, teachers, carers, parents and the young people involved are all present and heard. Working solely within digital mediums he understands and taps into creative solutions that make the digital format more tactile. Emma Pickett, Chair of the Association of Breastfeeding MothersEmma is an ABM breastfeeding counsellor and lactation consultant (IBCLC). Emma is also the author of  ‘The Breast Book’: a puberty book with a difference – it’s the when, why and how of breasts.  RISKS & CHALLENGESA selection of Agatha's film work shot on 35mm film, from left to right: Saoirse Ronan (How I Live Now), Rachel Weisz with Rachel McAdams (Disobedience), Kaya Scodelario (Wuthering Heights), Eddie Redmayne (The Danish Girl), Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl), Charlotte Rampling with Tom Courtney (45 Years) Every creative and social project has risks involving production.

<h3>A quick backstory and the idea</h3>
<p>Last July I have travelled to a small town called Avdiivka located on the frontline of the frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine. I have captured multiple angles and stories which I have put together into an article and gallery called 'The forgotten war' available to see on my <a href=""http://www.ondrejvachek.com/the-forgotten-war"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</p>

<p>I have already managed to establish good relations with the said group and therefore the only constraints I have at the moment are strictly budgetary.

However, I will be needing funds to pay for the expenses of this incredible study. So I am making some of my exclusive photography work available as prints and series and invite you to support this journey and become part of it! </span></p><p><b>Why is this important for me? </b></p><p>I want to continue growing on my photography journey and develop myself further aesthetically and more professionally. I want to study at <i>The Academy of Photography </i>which is right now -in my opinion- the best place to develop my true potential as a photographer and artist. Their extremely supportive environment, personal mentorship and coaching and the post-study support are the essentials I need for this development.</p><p><b>And why would you be part of this?</b><br/></p><div>Because you will receive wonderful and unique photography prints, exclusive limited series and other special photography work of mine!! :)</div><div>
<p>And join in this adventure to share, inspire, encourage and empower the world with the known and unknown beauty of photography! </p>

A little about meMy name is Kia (28) a Dutch/Portugese artist & photographer.I have always been observing, looking for beauty, in search of connection everywhere around me. And photography has been a tool for me to express myself: these dreams, the observations, the found and often missing beauty of the world and the most wonderful stories told by the seemingly insignificant moments, creatures, objects and forms of life.A little about my workI have been 8 years on this adventure of capturing life through photography. Recently I have been accepted at the prestigious Academy of Photography in Amsterdam, a beautiful opportunity to expand and grow within my photography. However, I will be needing funds to pay for the expenses of this incredible study. So I am making some of my exclusive photography work available as prints and series and invite you to support this journey and become part of it! Why is this important for me? I want to continue growing on my photography journey and develop myself further aesthetically and more professionally. I want to study at The Academy of Photography which is right now -in my opinion- the best place to develop my true potential as a photographer and artist. Their extremely supportive environment, personal mentorship and coaching and the post-study support are the essentials I need for this development.And why would you be part of this?Because you will receive wonderful and unique photography prints, exclusive limited series and other special photography work of mine!! :)
And join in this adventure to share, inspire, encourage and empower the world with the known and unknown beauty of photography! 


Secretively I existed beyond I listened behind I saw in between I was somewhere secretively within. 

What do I need?
My first goal in this campaign is to cover my study fees to start my first year, which is $ 9264. 
I will work alongside my study to cover all other campaign and study expenses.


If I reach this initial goal, my next goal will be my entire study! The total fees costs of this 3 year study are $ 23,977.
All the expenses that are involved:


$ 23,977 to cover the fees for the entire 3 years
$ 4,000 to cover some obliged materials & equipment
$ 2,397 to cover the Indiegogo and payment fees for this campaign
$ 1,982 to pay for the rewards and gifts for this campaign






What do you get?
First of all, you will receive my immense gratitude for your support! 
And I will be extremely happy and excited to share my work with you through unique and limited photography prints!

Risks and challenges:


I am extremely commited to this campaign so, even if I don't reach my entire goal I will make it happen and fullfill your rewards! :) If I don't reach this initial goal I will continue to walk this journey to grow as a photographer and share my work. 
With an amount of $ 9264 I can pay for the fees to start my first year of study! Thank you! :)
With a total of $ 34,400 it will be possible to do the entire study!! (as mentioned above in the 'what do I need' section). If I do not reach this second goal during this campaign I will start a follow-up campaign next year or fundings by other means.





earth gallery - wilderness II




My work has a tingle of out-of-the-ordinary, of mystery, and at the same time it is real, its the raw and real life. 


The strangers that walk this earth, humanity, our human experience fascinate me. Nature is my inspiration, my art, it carries me. Truth, justice, beauty, captured through me. 


I want to thank everybody who joins, shares the project and supports this journey of beauty!

<p>This project was born while I started to plan my 15-month trip around the world. I really wanted to <b>give a purpose to my trip, on a cultural and social ground.</b></p>
<p>Getting to the 30’s is quite an important event in our life…So I decided to go out there and find out what are the differences and similarities in the 30 year old generation throughout the world.</p>
<p>Is it the same to be a 30YO in France, Tanzania, Vietnam, Argentina or New Zealand? How do<b>nationality, culture, living environment... define our own identity?</b></p>
<p><br/>How does our <b>everyday life</b> look like? What are our <b>values</b>? What is important for us? How do we analyze our <b>past</b>? Our <b>present</b>? And our <b>future</b>? How do we see our <b>country</b>? And the<b>world</b> we are living in?</p>
<p>So far, this amazing journey took me to <b>25 countries, located on the 5 continents</b>, and enabled me to meet and share the life of more than <b>60 people aged between 29 and 35</b>. They live in <b>big cities</b> or in <b>small remote villages</b>. All from <b>different background and culture</b>… with their own stories and their own <b>vision</b>.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, I plan to go <b>meet and interview</b> more people from <b>5 other countries</b> in Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Over these last 15 months, I have documented these amazing stories on <a href=""http://www.being30yo.com/30-year-old-portraits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my blog</a>.</p>

I am a 31 years old photographer based in Paris, France.""Being 30 years old in the world"" is a project that aims at decoding what it means to be a 30-year-old in different countries around the world, trying to understand similarities and differences of one single generation across the globe. Over the last 15 months, I have met, photographed and interviewed more than 60 people on the 5 continents to share a slice of their lives.The goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to fund the creation of a beautiful hardcover book to share these amazing stories with you. The book will feature 30 portraits from 30 countries and YOU, kickstarter backers will choose the portraits that will be featured on the book.These stories have been documented on my blog: www.being30yo.com



Portrait of 10 people among the 65 I interviewed throughout the world.







This project was born while I started to plan my 15-month trip around the world. I really wanted to give a purpose to my trip, on a cultural and social ground.
Getting to the 30’s is quite an important event in our life…So I decided to go out there and find out what are the differences and similarities in the 30 year old generation throughout the world.
Is it the same to be a 30YO in France, Tanzania, Vietnam, Argentina or New Zealand? How donationality, culture, living environment... define our own identity?
How does our everyday life look like? What are our values? What is important for us? How do we analyze our past? Our present? And our future? How do we see our country? And theworld we are living in?
So far, this amazing journey took me to 25 countries, located on the 5 continents, and enabled me to meet and share the life of more than 60 people aged between 29 and 35. They live in big cities or in small remote villages. All from different background and culture… with their own stories and their own vision.
Over the next few months, I plan to go meet and interview more people from 5 other countries in Europe and North Africa.
Over these last 15 months, I have documented these amazing stories on my blog.



The book will feature portraits from 30 countries in 5 continents.


To be able to compare lifestyles and visions, every single person was asked the same interview which included questions about past, present and future. But the main point was to share authentic moments of their daily life and catch these with my camera.
This experience enabled me to see very contrasted lifestyles such as this one:

Example of Portraits: Diana (Australia) on the left and Bori (Ethiopia) on the right. Portraits include same type of pictures : Portraits, Home, Eating, Working, Life, Transport, Important Objects, Favorite Spot.

They talk about ""Being 30 years old in the world""
During my trip many websites from all over the world wrote articles about my projects in many different languages : English, French, Indian, Chinese, Finish, Bulgarian, Spanish, Slovak, Portuguese...




The book will be a beautiful coffee table art book featuring 30 inspiring illustrated stories of real men and women from 30 countries across the globe.

More about the project:


I went
digging into the photo albums of Irinas Popovas published online and the
repulsion changed into curiosity, the curiosity into a genuine interest, more
artistic than scientific.
I was
looking at how society functions by imposing the same stereotypical norms of
behavior, good life, self-representation and even dreams upon us. 
Private and
family albums go public without their authors realizing that anyone is allowed
to use them, for any purpose.
There is a
button that allows anyone to share and download an image. In doing so the image
loses any credits or source information, becoming an anonymous piece of
collective memory, just one more drop in the sea of Internet content.
And because
I had moved from Russia I browsed these profiles, and it seemed to me the
perfect way to research the Russian lifestyle and to make a project about
Russian people, and eventually about myself.
I was
interested in the typical and the unique and used this as a selection
principle. I was searching for something typically Russian in the
background, or in the small elements; in the colours and the
patterns; and a rather peculiar idea of beauty and proper life. At the same
time I was focusing on finding unique representations of one’s
personality, or in some places weird pictures for which I fail to find explanation.
While
looking at these images I noticed that every Irina Popova is striving to become
a princess, with a different degrees of success.
They are
born into a simple environment, and from an early childhood they get dressed as
a princess or as a doll. They all experience the same pressure of expectation
to become a successful girl, to find a prince, to get married, and to have
beautiful kids. It seems very difficult to escape this pattern, but it also

that BORDERS and NATIONALITY, and not FREEDOM, shape the IDENTITY of most of
the people on this planet? Today’s national borders have been in constant flux through
history and come from a desire to take other people's land and through blood
and tears. Everyone is born somewhere. It's not something you deserved, made or
gained. How is it then that the pure coincidence of being born in one country
leads all too often to a situation where you're ready to kill someone just
because that person doesn't belong to your tribe, nation, country or religion.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1271279/files/20150305102438-01210007.JPG?1425579878"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>I was born
in BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA and as a 9 year old girl I was forced to leave it as
a REFUGEE. My childhood somehow protected me from fully understanding
what the horrors of war are. War
was for me then the game of adults, a game no one could explain to me in a way
I could understand. I was taught to live in the present, to look forward
to the future, and to let the past stay in the past. I generally feel free from
some borders that people, wars, and history have shaped. Rootless would be the
closest picture of my concept of national identity and if any place defines me
as a person it would be planet Earth, not any particular country. In the
meantime, I moved to Berlin and it happens so often that in mixed international
groups people ask you: Where are you from? Sometimes you need to move away to
see the whole picture, to see that we are never free from our past and
countries we come from. I found out that part of me is still that 9 year old
Bosnian refugee girl, a girl that now wants to tell her story.</p>
<p>The WAR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that heart-shaped country
in the middle of Europe, finished 20 years ago. And it’s not just marks of the
war that you can see everywhere, like holes in the walls, it’s about the war
that is still happening in the heads of the people. Towns are still divided and
people are divided with their national identities. The hate and the un-forgiveness
are still very much alive and are disabling the country to develop and people
to live a normal life again. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1271285/files/20150305102544-00840033.JPG?1425579944"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>I want that
to CHANGE. My only weapon is my CAMERA. I came back to Bosnia and Herzegovina
as a photographer, traveled through it from my hometown Bugojno to capital
Sarajevo, from divided town Mostar to a place of the biggest massacre in that
war - Srebrenica. I was shooting THE LIVING and THE DEAD Bosnia and
Herzegovina, making portraits of PEOPLE in streets and on markets, and visiting
CEMETERIES. And exactly there, on Muslim, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, and
Partisan cemeteries I felt that I finally came home and found pieces of my
country. Those places don’t call for new hate, revenge or more killing. Death
makes everything even. If we can be the same in front of death, why can’t we be
brothers and sisters while we’re still alive?</p><p>Now, the time has come to show it to the world. I’ve decided to travel with this photo project from my newly adopted town of BERLIN, all the way through the BALKAN region and end up in ISTANBUL. The history of Berlin and Istanbul are marked by conflicts and divisions, but also by the demolition of walls and fostering of acceptance. Countries of the former Yugoslavia are still on their way to unfolding those nodes in themselves. This project will last from the end of April to the beginning of August 2015. The exhibition will try to start a dialog about identities, traces of both personal and global HISTORY, MEMORY and OBLIVION, FORGIVENESS and the lack of it. On my way I will also try to document other people's stories on these themes and show them afterwards.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1271290/files/20150305102726-07480016.JPG?1425580046"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 411px;""/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>This is
where you, my lovely audience, come in. I have prepared some nice GIFTS for you
– postcards, original prints and shoots. If you donate just 5 euro, this
enables me to buy a new roll of film for my analog cameras and every new film
brings 24 or 36 new possibilities. So this money
makes a real DIFFERENCE and I am utterly GRATEFUL for every piece of SUPPORT.
The money collected in this campaign will be used to cover travel costs,
accommodation, printing of photos and new films.</p>
<p>I believe
that ART can have the POWER to make a CHANGE in the world and I’m ready to do
it. Become a part of my project, help me break some borders in people's heads
and spread a little more COMPASSION and TOLERANCE. </p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>The BUDGET of the campaign is as follows:</p>
<p>Travel
costs for bus/train/carpooling – 1300 Euro</p>
<p>Costs of
accommodation (where it is not possible to use someone’s hospitality)– 600 Euro</p>
<p>Costs of
food and refreshments (not to be a starving artist :)) - 400 Euro</p>
<p>Costs of
residency in Istanbul – 500 Euro</p>
<p>Prints and
promotional materials for the project – 300 Euro</p>
<p>Film rolls
and other equipment – 200 Euro</p>
<p>Costs of
perks (printing and postal costs) – it's up to you, but let's say 200 Euro</p>
<p>Total costs
would therefore sum up to around 3.500 Euro, and I would be more than happy to
collect 2.000 of it from this campaign. The rest will hopefully come from some
other ways of Universe speaking.</p><p><br/></p><p>

see the whole picture, to see that we are never free from our past and
countries we come from. I found out that part of me is still that 9 year old
Bosnian refugee girl, a girl that now wants to tell her story.
The WAR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that heart-shaped country
in the middle of Europe, finished 20 years ago. And it’s not just marks of the
war that you can see everywhere, like holes in the walls, it’s about the war
that is still happening in the heads of the people. Towns are still divided and
people are divided with their national identities. The hate and the un-forgiveness
are still very much alive and are disabling the country to develop and people
to live a normal life again. 
I want that
to CHANGE. My only weapon is my CAMERA. I came back to Bosnia and Herzegovina
as a photographer, traveled through it from my hometown Bugojno to capital
Sarajevo, from divided town Mostar to a place of the biggest massacre in that
war - Srebrenica. I was shooting THE LIVING and THE DEAD Bosnia and
Herzegovina, making portraits of PEOPLE in streets and on markets, and visiting
CEMETERIES. And exactly there, on Muslim, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, and
Partisan cemeteries I felt that I finally came home and found pieces of my
country. Those places don’t call for new hate, revenge or more killing. Death
makes everything even. If we can be the same in front of death, why can’t we be
brothers and sisters while we’re still alive?Now, the time has come to show it to the world. I’ve decided to travel with this photo project from my newly adopted town of BERLIN, all the way through the BALKAN region and end up in ISTANBUL. The history of Berlin and Istanbul are marked by conflicts and divisions, but also by the demolition of walls and fostering of acceptance. Countries of the former Yugoslavia are still on their way to unfolding those nodes in themselves. This project will last from the end of April to the beginning of August 2015. The exhibition will try to start a dialog about identities, traces of both personal and global HISTORY, MEMORY and OBLIVION, FORGIVENESS and the lack of it. On my way I will also try to document other people's stories on these themes and show them afterwards.
I have
already found spaces to show my work in Berlin (Café & gallery Pappelreiche),
Frankfurt Oder (as a part of the festival Art and der Grenze), Prague
(Café & gallery Lajka), Rijeka
(Erste club Gallery), Split (No name
Gallery), Koprivnica (AK
Gallery), Tuzla (Peace Flame House Tuzla), Novi Sad (Café & gallery Frida),
Skopje (Kooperacija, Mobile /
Montage Gallery), Sofia (The Fridge)  and Istanbul (looking for the space). 
This is
where you, my lovely audience, come in. I have prepared some nice GIFTS for you
– postcards, original prints and shoots. If you donate just 5 euro, this
enables me to buy a new roll of film for my analog cameras and every new film
brings 24 or 36 new possibilities. So this money
makes a real DIFFERENCE and I am utterly GRATEFUL for every piece of SUPPORT.
The money collected in this campaign will be used to cover travel costs,
accommodation, printing of photos and new films.
I believe
that ART can have the POWER to make a CHANGE in the world and I’m ready to do
it. Become a part of my project, help me break some borders in people's heads
and spread a little more COMPASSION and TOLERANCE. The BUDGET of the campaign is as follows:
Travel
costs for bus/train/carpooling – 1300 Euro
Costs of
accommodation (where it is not possible to use someone’s hospitality)– 600 Euro
Costs of
food and refreshments (not to be a starving artist :)) - 400 Euro
Costs of
residency in Istanbul – 500 Euro
Prints and
promotional materials for the project – 300 Euro
Film rolls
and other equipment – 200 Euro
Costs of
perks (printing and postal costs) – it's up to you, but let's say 200 Euro
Total costs
would therefore sum up to around 3.500 Euro, and I would be more than happy to
collect 2.000 of it from this campaign. The rest will hopefully come from some
other ways of Universe speaking.

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>my name is <a href=""http://www.gianlucalabruna.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gianluca La Bruna</a>, an Italian photographer based in Malmö. I have been lucky enough to witness the rise of a magic place in town. I do believe that its unique story, that shaped the life of so many people, needs to be told. With this photo book everyone will get a glimpse of this wonderful community.</p>
<p>After all, everybody needs a PLAN B.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* * *</p>
<p>My forthcoming photo book is a reflection on a community, on music, DIY-culture and friends co-creating an alternative society, but it is also, on a very personal level, a representation of my personal growth.</p>
<p>Even when I was living in Italy, photography was my true passion, but it was a side job while I worked as a social worker and studied landscape architecture.</p>
<p>When I moved to Sweden a few years ago, a baby on the way and not quite 30 years old, I decided that photography, my passion, must also be my central focus.</p>
<p>I owe much to my experience with social work. I began developing an attention to the individual in relation to society while involved with an ethnographic research project at the University of Florence. For that project, which resulted in this <a href=""https://www.mondadoristore.it/Dentro-quartieri-edilizia-Barbara-Saracino-Erika-Cellini-Livia-Bruscaglioni/eai978886250545/?utm_source=tradedoubler&amp;utm_medium=affiliation&amp;utm_campaign=cpa&amp;affId=2353954"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">book</a>, I photographed the working class district in my hometown. But it wasn’t until <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/planbvenue"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plan B</a> that I really began exploring these relations using photographic language.</p>
</div><div>I’ve always felt a connection between music and photography. When I was a student, I had an apprenticeship at a music festival in my hometown. Shooting the festival between exams, I can’t say that I was doing deep social investigation, but I began to learn how to shoot fast and edit even faster.</div><div> </div><div>Soon after moving to Malmö, I met Carlo, Moraea and Viktor. They were getting ready to open a membership club in a basement on the so-called 'most dangerous streets in Malmö'. Within a few weeks they had booked bands and were staging concerts. There were like 180 bands within the first year and a half who played on that stage made from pallets. By the end of 2019 the number just blew up to 600. It was crazy, there was no time for anything else, I definitely wasn’t shooting between exams anymore.</div><div> </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602532925/x0aivauvcu03dui92xdp.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div> </div><div>This venue created out of nothing started to attract people that, like its creators, were driven out of a love of being together, a new feeling of freedom, of having a voice and an identity. All sorts of subcultures, movements, activists, communities gravitated towards Plan B, drawn, it seems, to the attractiveness of this belonging that was full of freedom to be unique.</div><div> </div><div>I was lucky to be at Plan B (Swedish for “basement level”) at the beginning, but even luckier to be someplace where I wanted to stay until the end.

Extract from the foreword.
John Peter Nilsson (former director at Moderna Museet Malmö and now museum strategist at Moderna Museet in Stockholm)

 

Hi everyone,
my name is Gianluca La Bruna, an Italian photographer based in Malmö. I have been lucky enough to witness the rise of a magic place in town. I do believe that its unique story, that shaped the life of so many people, needs to be told. With this photo book everyone will get a glimpse of this wonderful community.
After all, everybody needs a PLAN B.
* * *
My forthcoming photo book is a reflection on a community, on music, DIY-culture and friends co-creating an alternative society, but it is also, on a very personal level, a representation of my personal growth.
Even when I was living in Italy, photography was my true passion, but it was a side job while I worked as a social worker and studied landscape architecture.
When I moved to Sweden a few years ago, a baby on the way and not quite 30 years old, I decided that photography, my passion, must also be my central focus.
I owe much to my experience with social work. I began developing an attention to the individual in relation to society while involved with an ethnographic research project at the University of Florence. For that project, which resulted in this book, I photographed the working class district in my hometown. But it wasn’t until Plan B that I really began exploring these relations using photographic language.
I’ve always felt a connection between music and photography. When I was a student, I had an apprenticeship at a music festival in my hometown. Shooting the festival between exams, I can’t say that I was doing deep social investigation, but I began to learn how to shoot fast and edit even faster. Soon after moving to Malmö, I met Carlo, Moraea and Viktor. They were getting ready to open a membership club in a basement on the so-called 'most dangerous streets in Malmö'. Within a few weeks they had booked bands and were staging concerts. There were like 180 bands within the first year and a half who played on that stage made from pallets. By the end of 2019 the number just blew up to 600. It was crazy, there was no time for anything else, I definitely wasn’t shooting between exams anymore.  This venue created out of nothing started to attract people that, like its creators, were driven out of a love of being together, a new feeling of freedom, of having a voice and an identity. All sorts of subcultures, movements, activists, communities gravitated towards Plan B, drawn, it seems, to the attractiveness of this belonging that was full of freedom to be unique. I was lucky to be at Plan B (Swedish for “basement level”) at the beginning, but even luckier to be someplace where I wanted to stay until the end. Plan B in its basement era was the best family, safe, free and full of love. Night after night, I documented almost every single concert and event. Plan B has been the place where to go when there was no plan A. This is my plan B.  Book specs:

With your support, we would be launching features to help photographers make money from the platform as well,Featured and supported by
What We Need & What You Get
The amount raised from this campaign would be mainly used for the following purposes including support for the technical side of the website.


Marketing of the platform to increase the user base and spread the word about the amazing features and platform that we are trying to build. 
Secondly, there are a number of online courses that we wish to do, which are requested by our users. These courses would need some initial investment for production, editing, photographer fee etc. We wish to use the raised amount for these courses.
We wish to sponsor good prizes for our competitions for the benefit of our community.
Also, we'll use some money for general website maintenance, servers and more...
If we are not able to reach our goal, we would distribute the amount raised in the above categories as follows.


If you choose to support our campaign we will be eternally grateful to you. Though there are no gifts that we can give you to say thank you for your contribution, these small token of thanks would be given to all our backers.  

Every backer will be mentioned on our website, with special mentions to all big backers. 
We are giving away our present online courses, to help you in improving your photography skills and support our mission. If you want to wait and enroll in the upcoming courses please drop us an email after making your contribution.
There are some amazing Coffee Table Photo Books to be grabbed, with the best photos from our platform from 2017.
For big backers of $500 and $2,000, there are special mentions, Sweat Shirts with Full Access to our complete website (WorldPhotographersClub.com) and upgrade to Pro-Account for access to all top features to the website. 


The Impact

Your contributions will help us in a lot of ways.
We would be able to market the platform and its features to get at least 500,000 users in the next 12 months.


We would be able to produce 6 new online courses on Fashion Photography, Food Photography, Photoshop and Lightroom, Advanced Photography Concepts, Nature & WIldlife and Mobile Photography.

It would help us to maintain and enhance the website to meet global standards. 
And finally in the next coming months, we wish to make WPC the preferred choice of every photographer around the world. And with your help and support we should be able to reach their very soon.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Il mondo è un luogo magico e vogliamo mostrarvelo.</p>
<p>Kokparbrothers è un team che riunisce due appassionati di vita, viaggi, avventure e, soprattutto, fotografia e video.</p>
<p>Ci definiamo fratelli che condividono la stessa sensibilità e gli stessi interessi. Ognuno ha un talento diverso, personalità diverse, ma siamo uniti da grande affetto reciproco e passione, siamo nel cuore ""brothers"". Ognuno ha la propria storia e i propri obiettivi, il proprio impegno verso se stesso e per la squadra.</p>
<p>Insieme abbiamo deciso di partecipare al Mongol Rally2019, un viaggio che ci porterà attraverso 26 paesi, per 18.000 km, a bordo di una FIAT 500.</p>
<p>Vogliamo ritrarre questo cammino, dalla terra e dal cielo: 60 giorni sulle rotte carovaniere della Via della Seta mostrando al mondo le culture e i luoghi.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Il Mongol Rally è un rally non competitivo che ha principalmente scopo benefico.</p>
<p>Vogliamo quindi che il nostro viaggio e la nostra professionalità fotografica si uniscano per realizzare un libro di immagini e racconti.</p>
<p>La realizzazione del libro ci permetterà di dare un valore visuale al contributo che doneremo alle ONG, di ringraziare con un oggetto tangibile i nostri sostenitori e di avere memoria con la bellezza di un'avventura che è dono per noi e per gli altri.</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>Il viaggio, che dura due mesi e mezzo, sarà sicuramente ricco di meraviglie, ma ci riserverà qualche rischio. Non è un viaggio semplice: le regole impongono un percorso libero ma anche di viaggiare su un mezzo poco potente, senza l'aiuto di navigatori o di tecnologie moderne. Un viaggio alla vecchia maniera, cartina e bussola alla mano, niente autostrade, nessun privilegio, nessuna assistenza. Ci stiamo preparando da un anno agli imprevisti e faremo in modo che tutti possano seguirci attraverso i canali social ma anche con interviste radio e dirette.</p>
<p>Vogliamo che ci sia dialogo e interazione in tempo reale con tutti coloro che seguiranno la nostra avventura. Sarà appassionante accompagnarci con una presenza virtuale nelle nostre sfide quotidiane e si potrà avere un assaggio dell'atmosfera che vogliamo includere nel libro.</p>

My name is Pete Lamberto. I'm a photographer based in Copenhagen. My work includes portraits I have done with, mostly, people who are a part of the LGBTQ community for the past five years or so.
WHAT'S UP?Around a year
ago one of my best friends told me that his husband of eight years,
had revealed that he did not feel at home in his body, and
never had. She was not the boy, that her body had tried to fit on her in. And it had now reached a point, where it was no longer bearable to be dressing up as Marc; Marc had to become Maggie.

Sean was devastated. They both were.  Days went
by, weeks, months, and somewhere within this time frame, something
amazing happened – they did not slip apart, they grew
closer. I realized that I was now witnessing a love story of such a grand proportion; a story that I had to dig deeper into. 

WHERE DOES THE CROWDFUNDING COME IN? (PART 1)Well, as this currently unfolding story is happening, the next step for them will be Antwerp, where there is a clinic that has specialized in beauty operations, especially for transgender people. Maggie will be going through a facial surgery to enhance feminine features that will get her closer to becoming, and feeling, as herself. I would love to document this part of their journey, as it's one of the major events when transitioning, being able to exist publicly without everybody questioning your physical appearance. But plane tickets, hotel stay for at least six or seven days, insurances, etc. is just something that I currently cannot afford to realize completely by myself. WHERE DOES THE CROWDFUNDING COME IN? (PART 2)The second part is an exhibition that I'm going to setup here in Copenhagen; an exhibition that hopefully will be traveling outside of Denmark as well. But exhibitions are quite expensive to execute properly; there are print costs, framing, shipping, insurances, promotion, etc. so most of the fundings will be utilized to create the exhibition that I feel this story deserves.LET'S DO THIS TOGETHERI sincerely hope
that many of you will help me make this happen, and be a part of
framing this epic lovestory.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?There are great perks for you!Depending on what you feel like contributing with, it's everything from being credited on the project (online and on the material being produced in context of the exhibition), to receiving the forthcoming photoseries in your inbox, thank you videos, and limited edition prints that will be signed, sealed and delivered (and numbered, of course) to you.So jump on board and be part of supporting this project, and celebrate our differences that makes this world so colorful!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our next project - and biggest yet - is a photobook, expected for release during Summer 2017. As it is currently in the preproduction phase, we need capital to print copies and contributors to pre-order it.</p>

<p>We aim to produce fine art stylized, thematic content and this book is no exception. This photobook will talk about personal coping methods and experiences with escapism, as well as a variety of widely practiced coping methods! What makes this book special is our focus to produce it the way we see it - through the perspective of a teenager. It will be produced with both high quality color and authentic to film black and white images.</p>

<div>
<p></p>
<p>Hi,
my name is Marina, a girl full of contradictions : born in Marseille,
the city of french hip hop on the year disco music still mattered, l
love myself a good pogo brawl at rock concerts, and I’ve been
clubbing for more than 20 years. I lived in Paris for 15 years. </p>
<br/>After
my first music blog <a href=""http://musicbymarina.fr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">musicbymarina.fr</a> was
created in 2011, I started following djs, producers and rock bands
throughout Europe with my camera. <br/><p>First
was a Sony compact cam in 2012, then came shortly after my current
Nikon reflex camera, plain, without using any extra features such as
flash, lightings, neither image editing softwares. This gave me the
freedom to not denature my own vision when pressing the shutter
button. </p>I
had the good fortune of catching the eye of some cool people and
since then was commissioned by various magazines and musical labels
photo reports and portraits in backstage. </div>

<h3>About my Project</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>What can I say about Andrew Weatherall ? I stumbled upon him on a website which was describing him as a :  «Legend of British underground and one of the most active motors of electronic music in the last two decades, Andrew Weatherall has enough honours to overflow any attempt to biographical approach. » </div><div>He was one of my very first models for the music blog back in 2012 alongside Matthew Dear. 
Then, without any financial support, I took every chance I got to take some pictures of him each time he came to France for the past 3 years. </div><div>It was when I was last year invited to his self curated festival in Carcassonne (France) that I started to figure out this project of organizing an exhibition around those 3 years shooting him. First would be my native country, and hopefully later on in the UK. </div><div>This exhibition will be a great opportunity to showcase my work and passion, which I hope will lead to more exposure and  commissions.<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>I need to raise funding for the printing and framing of roughly 21 pictures as well as shipping and installing them at the gallery in Carcassonne. </div><div>I will also need accomodation during the 7 days exhibition period. </div><div> 20 signed and numbered prints of each of the 21 exhibited pictures will be made available for purchase from the gallery without framing. </div><div>The exhibition is currently scheduled from 24th to 30th september 2015 in Carcassonne, at Bloc G (adress : 112, rue Barbacane - 11000 Carcassonne) for <strong><a href=""http://convenanzafestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Convenanza festival</a></strong>. <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The sooner I can raise the money, with your support, the sooner I can
get the prints and frames made, and prepare the exhibition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I
have set up some perks for your donations, you can see what you'd get
for your donation if you look on the right side of this campaign.
Every bit counts and I am forever grateful for your help! If I get
more than 2100€, the remaining money will go towards funding my
next UK photo exhibition tour about Andrew Weatherall.</p>

Hi,
my name is Marina, a girl full of contradictions : born in Marseille,
the city of french hip hop on the year disco music still mattered, l
love myself a good pogo brawl at rock concerts, and I’ve been
clubbing for more than 20 years. I lived in Paris for 15 years. 
After
my first music blog musicbymarina.fr was
created in 2011, I started following djs, producers and rock bands
throughout Europe with my camera. First
was a Sony compact cam in 2012, then came shortly after my current
Nikon reflex camera, plain, without using any extra features such as
flash, lightings, neither image editing softwares. This gave me the
freedom to not denature my own vision when pressing the shutter
button. I
had the good fortune of catching the eye of some cool people and
since then was commissioned by various magazines and musical labels
photo reports and portraits in backstage. 

 


My
works :

Magazines
:


	Publications
	in Trax, Tsugi, Modzik, Paris Match, Mixmag, The Guardian, Dazed and
	Confused, Interview...

About my Project


What can I say about Andrew Weatherall ? I stumbled upon him on a website which was describing him as a :  «Legend of British underground and one of the most active motors of electronic music in the last two decades, Andrew Weatherall has enough honours to overflow any attempt to biographical approach. » He was one of my very first models for the music blog back in 2012 alongside Matthew Dear. 
Then, without any financial support, I took every chance I got to take some pictures of him each time he came to France for the past 3 years. It was when I was last year invited to his self curated festival in Carcassonne (France) that I started to figure out this project of organizing an exhibition around those 3 years shooting him. First would be my native country, and hopefully later on in the UK. This exhibition will be a great opportunity to showcase my work and passion, which I hope will lead to more exposure and  commissions.
   What I Need & What You Get 


I need to raise funding for the printing and framing of roughly 21 pictures as well as shipping and installing them at the gallery in Carcassonne. I will also need accomodation during the 7 days exhibition period.  20 signed and numbered prints of each of the 21 exhibited pictures will be made available for purchase from the gallery without framing. The exhibition is currently scheduled from 24th to 30th september 2015 in Carcassonne, at Bloc G (adress : 112, rue Barbacane - 11000 Carcassonne) for Convenanza festival. 

The sooner I can raise the money, with your support, the sooner I can
get the prints and frames made, and prepare the exhibition.

I
have set up some perks for your donations, you can see what you'd get
for your donation if you look on the right side of this campaign.
Every bit counts and I am forever grateful for your help! If I get
more than 2100€, the remaining money will go towards funding my
next UK photo exhibition tour about Andrew Weatherall.
The different images from the donations are :
- My first print 40x60cm (16x24 inches) from the exhibition, signed, numbered and without framing. The only first copy out of 20 will be available here. http://andrewweatherallbymarina.tumblr.com/tagged/40x60cm 
- My print 50x70cm (20x28 inches), signed, numbered and without framing. 13 images are available for you to choose from at the exhibition. The only first copy out of 20 will be available here.   http://andrewweatherallbymarina.tumblr.com/tagged/50x70cm
- My print 60x90cm (24x36 inches), signed, numbered and without framing. 7 images are available for you to choose from at the exhibition. The only first copy out of 20 will be available here.  http://andrewweatherallbymarina.tumblr.com/tagged/60x90cm

Other ways you can help me

The indiegogo share tools will help you spread the word.I'm searching for some galleries or spaces which are able to host my exhibition.

Und hier kommen wir schon zum ersten Punkt, wieso ich diese Kampagne gestartet habe. Als Auszubildene hat man nur ein begrenztes Budget zu Verfügung, was mir daher leider nicht erlaubt mir bzw. meinen Models große Projekte zu finanzieren, welche ich sehr gerne in die Tat umsetzen wollen würde, um qualitativ und progressiv besser zu werden.<br/>Qualität ist mir wirklich sehr wichtig, vor allem auch für meine Follower, die sich meine Bilder anschauen und bewundern wollen. Daher spreche ich hier die Leute an, die gerne mehr und noch bessere Bilder von mir sehen möchten und mich, auch wenn es nur ein kleiner Betrag ist, hier unterstützen wollen.<br/>Viele werden sich sicher denken, dass man ja auch auf seine Wünsche sparen kann, jedoch sind Utensilien im Bereich Fotografie nicht gerade kostengünstig und sind erst ab circa 200€ erwerbar. Dies ist bereits mein Gehalt alleine, sodass ich leider kaum eine Möglichkeit finde mich persönlich in meinem Hobby und anstrebenden Beruf weiterzubilden.<br/><br/>Ihr helft mir daher hier generell ein neues Equipment zusammen zu stellen, unter anderem mit einer neuen Softbox,  Stative, einer neuen und besseren Blitze und einem hübschen Hintergrund. Außerdem möchte ich meinen Models neue Perücken, Klamotten oder Cosplays ermöglichen und daher die 2000€ nur ein ""kleiner Teil"" einer relativ großen Summe ist.<br/><br/>Und daher kommen wir nun zum Thema was ihr für eure Unterstützung bekommt. Generell möchte ich euch allen etwas geben, indem ich mehr poste, sowie mein gesammeltes Wissen an euch alle weitergebe. Dazu biete ich hier verschiedene Perks für euch an, die Bilder-Pakete enthalten bzw. sehr schöne Fotos von meinen bezauberenden Models Rin Cosplay, Nioria Cosplay, Yvoli Cosplay, Cesca Page etc.. Diese werden für euch verfügbar sein, ab einem bestimmten Betrag.<br/><br/>Um nochmal mein eigentliches Ziel für euch zu verdeutlichen, ich möchte meinen derzeitigen technischen Stand verbessern um jeden von euch, ob Model oder Follower, durch meine Bilder glücklich zu stimmen. Ich möchte meine Werke mit euch allen teilen und daher von Zeit zu Zeit euch auch zeigen können, dass ich mich immer mehr verbessere.

<h2>Travel Inspired...</h2>
<p>is a series of unique limited edition prints with a special purpose; to inspire the uninspired and show the uninitiated that their adventure is out there waiting for them.  I was once one of those people, but I can say with confidence that visiting new lands and cultures has changed my life, made me a better man, and the photographer I am today.  This passion I now seek to share with the world and fund this passion through the sale of my prints.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Travel is a gift!</h2>
<p>A gift for all, but it's not always that obvious to some. I used to be one of those who believed that travel was a luxury reserved for other people but now, through my photography, I seek to inspire others to take up their own adventure and explore the world. To contribute towards my equipment costs, I have previously sold what you might call 'unmanaged prints'; but now for the first time, I am seeking to offer a collection of signed Limited Edition prints taken from my travel portfolio as I continue in my journey of personal discovery and adventure.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Istanbul is where it began...</h2>
<p>For the past 4 years, I have been traveling the world falling ever so deeply in love with the excitement of visiting new worlds and the challenge of taking unique and original photographs that perfectly capture my time there. Inspired in 2015 by the wonders of Istanbul where East meets West, and armed with nothing more than a Samsung S6 smartphone, I was drawn into photography by a burning desire to capture more than just holiday snaps, and my passion for photography was ignited.</p>
<p>It was around this time that I had moved away from the music industry where I had been a creative for many years before, and had left a big hole in my life; photography and travel were a complete surprise for me and quickly filled the creative void left by my music.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567249789/lb9zm14qpbpnuw3npmx5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Galata Tower​ Istanbul 2015</i></p>
<p>Five or six years ago, I would have considered travel to be something of pure luxury reserved only for other people and totally out of reach for someone like me. It wasn't until I met my partner who is very well-traveled and has exceptional abilities at planning and booking complex trips that my whole view of what a holiday could be. Once a fairly uncultured individual, I now want to inspire others to travel through my photography, showing people like the man I used to be that it is possible to enjoy these spectacular experiences.</p>
<p>From my humble beginnings with nothing more than a smartphone, I have been in a constant state of evolution in both my photography skills and the equipment I shoot with. Teaching myself through trial and error, watching hundreds, if not thousands, of YouTube videos and reading books and magazines on the subject. It has been a glorious yet often frustrating journey going from a mobile, to full manual; JPEG to RAW; a cropped sensor to full-frame. Entry camera bodies with kit lenses, to full-frame bodies with pro lenses; and long may the journey continue!</p>
<p>There have been two particular moments that stand out to me in the last couple of years where I have felt genuinely validated in what I do, and from these moments I take comfort in knowing that I am on the right path. Moments when I have found myself grinning with excitement and pleasure from the sheer fact of exploring a new land and taking on the challenge of capturing inspirational images. </p>
<p>The first of these moments was in Havana last year. Arriving in any new destination does bring a sense of stress, not only from the physical act of traveling but then the pressure to start capturing interesting and unique images of a place I have never visited before. For a Londoner, Havana is a real shock to the senses and did take some time to adjust, but after the first sunrise, I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of pleasure from being there with my camera. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567249932/rubtxoipvaigvtydsmtp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Malecon - Havana 2018</i></p>
<p>The second was this year in Athens; stood upon the Acropolis shortly after opening with barely a soul in sight it felt like a photographers playground. Throughout my entire time in the Greek capital, I had an almost overwhelming sense of satisfaction as I explored the streets capturing the character and charm of this ancient city. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567250067/rvnjw8ap38kfiwvogkax.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Filopappou Hill, Athens - 2019</i></p>
<p>All the hard work in getting to these moments was worth it, even if it was just for the smile on my face. From an untraveled individual with nothing more than a smartphone, to the man I am today is the real journey, and I encourage all to find a similar journey for themselves. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Taking the next step...</h2>
<p>As the quality of my work improved, so did my confidence; it was time to find a platform to publicly display my work and offer prints for sale, and so around 2017 I launched my website with a built in store, and then subsequently an Etsy store as outlets to sell my work. This was when I started to print my work for the first time, opting to use Loxley Colour in Scotland as my chosen print lab, who I use to this day because of their exceptional quality. The experiencing of holding your image professionally printed is truly amazing. Being able to hold the image and feel the quality and see the depth in the print is a glorious conclusion to the photo-taking process.</p>
<p>Entering photography fairly late in life, and with the seemingly unstoppable rise of social media,  I knew that any real chances of being able to support myself from my photographic work were fairly nonexistent, but a more realistic goal would be to try and make my passion self funded. To this end, I have seen small successes through print on demand sales through Etsy, my website and an exhibition of my Asian portfolio in 2018, but compared to my costs to date, this is small change.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567250365/lisdu0sxqkpbimov7wdn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Exhibition 2018</i></p>
<p>This year, I vowed to take the commercial side of my photography more seriously; I am passionate about my work and my message, but I did recognize that my whole e-commerce strategy was amateur, and if I didn't take it seriously, then why should anyone else?  This was a serious question I had to answer, and through my blog posts <a href=""https://www.j6pix.com/Blog/How-not-to-sell-photos-on-Etsy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'How Not to Sell on Etsy</a>' and '<a href=""https://www.j6pix.com/Blog/J6-Etsy-Store-20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">J6 Etsy Store 2.0</a>', I looked back on my previous selling experiences and explored a new direction. </p>
<p>This led me to revise my business model; by introducing more structure I could see an opportunity to increase my exposure and saleability which intern should boost profits. My thinking was to flip my original print-on-demand model in favor of carefully selected limited edition prints for sale through my Etsy store, my website, and social media. Each print would be shipped with a signed certificate of authenticity which will add value and legitimacy to my work. I am also seeking to improve my postage and packaging by investing in a label printer and other items to improve the overall experience to prospective buyers.</p>
<p>This extra investment will see my work finished to a high standard and professionally packaged, significantly improving the overall buying experience. I want buyers to receive my print and feel entirely satisfied with their purchase, despite it being packed and shipped from my living room. </p>
<p>This new business model will see my print costs reduced slightly, consequently increasing the profitability of each sale, but it does carry the risk that I am left financially exposed with a number of prints without homes to go to. To manage this risk, I will be holding a limited stock of each print, whilst at the same time maximizing the online exposure of the listings but without being too pushy, because nobody wants that. </p>
<p>With so much enthusiasm surrounding the business relaunch, I forged ahead, but I was not anticipating the major setback that followed...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>An unexpected challenge...</h2>
<p>In March, Trouble one of our two much-loved cats was taken ill and spent a night at the vets for what was initially diagnosed to be a bout of sickness. Due to them being indoor cats, and my own naivety/stupidity, I had not taken out pet insurance and so was left to foot the large bill for his treatment. He made a quick recovery and so we thought we were in the clear, but this was not to last.</p>
<p>At the beginning of July, he was readmitted because he had stopped eating and became withdrawn, something totally out of character for him. He was eventually diagnosed by a specialist with Lymphoma and the bills began to rise sharply. Naturally, any thoughts of funding my photography at this crucial time were fading fast.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567250587/l3npwk638hsmcwtuxelm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>My Trouble Cub</i></p>
<p>Sadly, despite all our best efforts, Trouble was taken by his illness. This was a very difficult time and one that I was not expecting, and anything bar the essential was placed on hold. Financially I was struggling, and emotionally I was broken. </p>
<p>To distract myself from this difficult time, I returned to my business plan and began to think of a new way of funding my project and realizing my goal. What if I could place the products into the hands of early supporters who are as passionate about my work and my journey as I am? These early purchases would help my project get back on track, while I am recovering from the financial fall out of Trouble's treatment. Potential backers (like you) could provide some much-needed support and in return, receive a specially selected piece of my work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p>For this campaign, I have handpicked 7 unique images that were taken in well-known destinations, but have an air of mystery that forces the viewer to ask 'where was this taken?'. This combination of the familiar combined with an air of intrigue makes these images ideal statement pieces for your home. </p>

<p>Each edition will be printed on Fujicolor Professional DP II Lustre photographic paper, which combines the best of matt and gloss in one glorious product. The matt finish gives the print a unique feel and appearance whilst offering incredible depth in color, whilst maintaining a slight shine to the image without being too reflective like traditional gloss photographs. The prints are of exceptional quality and feel special in the hand. </p>
<p>This edition will be strictly limited to 66 pieces for this size, and once they are gone, they are gone! Each print is signed and numbered by myself and shipped with a signed certificate of authenticity.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where am I now?</h2>
<p>To date, I have obtained sample test prints of a wide number of shots and,  some full-size test prints to validate the quality of printing at full size. My chosen print lab Loxley Colour provides an excellent test printing service where they print your chosen image as provided, and include a version with their colour correction applied so that these can be compared.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567251223/zaay5njvcvztvkyvj1wd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>From these test prints, I was able to make my final image selection with confidence knowing that the quality of the printing work for the project would be nothing less than exceptional. </p>
<p>In preparation for the launch of this project, I have also purchased the address label printer and certificate paper to print the authenticating certificates, which are designed and ready to print.</p>
<p>Setting aside the cost of the trips themselves (something I know will never be recovered) this project has cost £200.00, but there is a long way to go. To realize this project I am seeking £1,400.00, which is broken down as follows:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567251303/cpzvt6tvqqu7m7hekwmx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All the funds raised here contribute towards the cost of this project and do not include any profit. My intention is to make my profit through future sales once the campaign is complete. Reaching the funding goal will ensure I have sufficient funds to purchase all the stock to launch this series and begin turning a profit to fund my passion. To ensure I have sufficient copies of the final prints to reward backers and stock my online stores, I am basing my costs around 20 copies of each image. That's a total of 120 prints.</p>
<p>Pretty ambitious, but I believe in setting high targets!</p>
<p> </p>

You will also receive your choice of 1no. signed limited edition 45 x 35 cm print with authenticating certificates. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Ahead of me now is the proofing of the full suite of images to get them all ready for printing. The proofing and test printing process are crucial steps in the printing workflow that could make or break the final product. Very slight tweaks in aspect ratio could see essential elements of the image cropped from the overall image and spoil the final presentation.</p>
<p>There is also the biggest bane of a photographers life, color space. The colors you see on your digital viewing screen are not quite the same as the color space available by photographic printers, and so careful management of the color is required to get the final print as close to that seen on a digital screen. This is done through simulating the paper type and making fine-tune adjustments to the colors until there is a match, or as close as possible to the on-screen original.</p>
<p>I have already assessed the colours on the small test prints, but before I go to full print I need to order full-size artist proofs of each image to 100% validate the print quality. This could require multiple test prints until the image is right and poses a big risk to my project if I fail to get this right; I couldn't offer a product for sale if it was anything less than perfect. I am well-read on the subject of color space, have experience in printing and work with a world-class print lab, so I am confident that the final product will be of exceptional quality. </p>
<p>All being well, I will be ordering the prints near the completion of the campaign, signing them and packing them ready to send to my supporters. I am hoping to have the final product in the hands of backer by early November, give or take a week or two. </p>
<p>There is a chance that we don't hit the funding goal of course, but that's ok. This campaign is flexible, so regardless of the amount raised your reward will be honored. Failing to meet the funding goal will just mean that I have to scale back on the range of images included in this initial collection. Should any images from this collection not be chosen as rewards they'll be placed on the back burner to reduce my overall project cost in line with the total amount pledged. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The work doesn't stop there...</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When the campaign has run its course, my prints will go 'InDemand', so if you miss a chance to pledge during the funding process the images will still be offered for sale from this page. </p>
<p>For me, I still have a lot of work to do! To launch the official sale of these prints  I will need to do a product photoshoot for each of the shots and create my listings ready to share to the world. I intend to sell these prints through my Esty store, social media and of course my personal website. I can see this process taking me up to Christmas this year, which if everything comes together will mean that I will meet the objective I set myself at the beginning of the year, and finally launch these limited edition prints! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Thank You!</h2>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project. Time is precious, so the time you have given in learning about my story is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>If you can't contribute today, that's ok, I am humbled you have still come this far. You can still show your support by sharing this page with your travel buddies; Indiegogo has buttons right here to share on your favorite socials, it couldn't be easier and would go a long way! </p>
<p>To keep up with my progress follow me on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/j6pix/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/j6pixphotography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> where I will be posting regular updates on the project. </p>

<p>Happy travels! </p>
</div></div>","Travel Inspired...
is a series of unique limited edition prints with a special purpose; to inspire the uninspired and show the uninitiated that their adventure is out there waiting for them.  I was once one of those people, but I can say with confidence that visiting new lands and cultures has changed my life, made me a better man, and the photographer I am today.  This passion I now seek to share with the world and fund this passion through the sale of my prints.
 
Travel is a gift!
A gift for all, but it's not always that obvious to some. I used to be one of those who believed that travel was a luxury reserved for other people but now, through my photography, I seek to inspire others to take up their own adventure and explore the world. To contribute towards my equipment costs, I have previously sold what you might call 'unmanaged prints'; but now for the first time, I am seeking to offer a collection of signed Limited Edition prints taken from my travel portfolio as I continue in my journey of personal discovery and adventure.
 
Istanbul is where it began...
For the past 4 years, I have been traveling the world falling ever so deeply in love with the excitement of visiting new worlds and the challenge of taking unique and original photographs that perfectly capture my time there. Inspired in 2015 by the wonders of Istanbul where East meets West, and armed with nothing more than a Samsung S6 smartphone, I was drawn into photography by a burning desire to capture more than just holiday snaps, and my passion for photography was ignited.
It was around this time that I had moved away from the music industry where I had been a creative for many years before, and had left a big hole in my life; photography and travel were a complete surprise for me and quickly filled the creative void left by my music.

Galata Tower​ Istanbul 2015
Five or six years ago, I would have considered travel to be something of pure luxury reserved only for other people and totally out of reach for someone like me. It wasn't until I met my partner who is very well-traveled and has exceptional abilities at planning and booking complex trips that my whole view of what a holiday could be. Once a fairly uncultured individual, I now want to inspire others to travel through my photography, showing people like the man I used to be that it is possible to enjoy these spectacular experiences.
From my humble beginnings with nothing more than a smartphone, I have been in a constant state of evolution in both my photography skills and the equipment I shoot with. Teaching myself through trial and error, watching hundreds, if not thousands, of YouTube videos and reading books and magazines on the subject. It has been a glorious yet often frustrating journey going from a mobile, to full manual; JPEG to RAW; a cropped sensor to full-frame. Entry camera bodies with kit lenses, to full-frame bodies with pro lenses; and long may the journey continue!
There have been two particular moments that stand out to me in the last couple of years where I have felt genuinely validated in what I do, and from these moments I take comfort in knowing that I am on the right path. Moments when I have found myself grinning with excitement and pleasure from the sheer fact of exploring a new land and taking on the challenge of capturing inspirational images. 
The first of these moments was in Havana last year. Arriving in any new destination does bring a sense of stress, not only from the physical act of traveling but then the pressure to start capturing interesting and unique images of a place I have never visited before. For a Londoner, Havana is a real shock to the senses and did take some time to adjust, but after the first sunrise, I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of pleasure from being there with my camera.

My thinking was to flip my original print-on-demand model in favor of carefully selected limited edition prints for sale through my Etsy store, my website, and social media. Each print would be shipped with a signed certificate of authenticity which will add value and legitimacy to my work. I am also seeking to improve my postage and packaging by investing in a label printer and other items to improve the overall experience to prospective buyers.
This extra investment will see my work finished to a high standard and professionally packaged, significantly improving the overall buying experience. I want buyers to receive my print and feel entirely satisfied with their purchase, despite it being packed and shipped from my living room. 
This new business model will see my print costs reduced slightly, consequently increasing the profitability of each sale, but it does carry the risk that I am left financially exposed with a number of prints without homes to go to. To manage this risk, I will be holding a limited stock of each print, whilst at the same time maximizing the online exposure of the listings but without being too pushy, because nobody wants that. 
With so much enthusiasm surrounding the business relaunch, I forged ahead, but I was not anticipating the major setback that followed...
 
An unexpected challenge...
In March, Trouble one of our two much-loved cats was taken ill and spent a night at the vets for what was initially diagnosed to be a bout of sickness. Due to them being indoor cats, and my own naivety/stupidity, I had not taken out pet insurance and so was left to foot the large bill for his treatment. He made a quick recovery and so we thought we were in the clear, but this was not to last.
At the beginning of July, he was readmitted because he had stopped eating and became withdrawn, something totally out of character for him. He was eventually diagnosed by a specialist with Lymphoma and the bills began to rise sharply. Naturally, any thoughts of funding my photography at this crucial time were fading fast.

My Trouble Cub
Sadly, despite all our best efforts, Trouble was taken by his illness. This was a very difficult time and one that I was not expecting, and anything bar the essential was placed on hold. Financially I was struggling, and emotionally I was broken. 
To distract myself from this difficult time, I returned to my business plan and began to think of a new way of funding my project and realizing my goal. What if I could place the products into the hands of early supporters who are as passionate about my work and my journey as I am? These early purchases would help my project get back on track, while I am recovering from the financial fall out of Trouble's treatment. Potential backers (like you) could provide some much-needed support and in return, receive a specially selected piece of my work.
 
The Campaign
For this campaign, I have handpicked 7 unique images that were taken in well-known destinations, but have an air of mystery that forces the viewer to ask 'where was this taken?'. This combination of the familiar combined with an air of intrigue makes these images ideal statement pieces for your home. 
Here is the full range of images and the story behind them. For a full-size, hi-resolution version, click on the image to open a new tab.







Each edition will be printed on Fujicolor Professional DP II Lustre photographic paper, which combines the best of matt and gloss in one glorious product. The matt finish gives the print a unique feel and appearance whilst offering incredible depth in color, whilst maintaining a slight shine to the image without being too reflective like traditional gloss photographs. The prints are of exceptional quality and feel special in the hand. 
This edition will be strictly limited to 66 pieces for this size, and once they are gone, they are gone! Each print is signed and numbered by myself and shipped with a signed certificate of authenticity.

The prints are based around size ISO A3, the exact dimensions are as follows:
Image Size

39.5 x 29.5cm
15.5 x 11.5""

 
With Border

44.5 x 34.5cm
17.5 x 13.5""

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where am I now?
To date, I have obtained sample test prints of a wide number of shots and,  some full-size test prints to validate the quality of printing at full size. My chosen print lab Loxley Colour provides an excellent test printing service where they print your chosen image as provided, and include a version with their colour correction applied so that these can be compared.

From these test prints, I was able to make my final image selection with confidence knowing that the quality of the printing work for the project would be nothing less than exceptional. 
In preparation for the launch of this project, I have also purchased the address label printer and certificate paper to print the authenticating certificates, which are designed and ready to print.
Setting aside the cost of the trips themselves (something I know will never be recovered) this project has cost £200.00, but there is a long way to go. To realize this project I am seeking £1,400.00, which is broken down as follows:

All the funds raised here contribute towards the cost of this project and do not include any profit. My intention is to make my profit through future sales once the campaign is complete. Reaching the funding goal will ensure I have sufficient funds to purchase all the stock to launch this series and begin turning a profit to fund my passion. To ensure I have sufficient copies of the final prints to reward backers and stock my online stores, I am basing my costs around 20 copies of each image. That's a total of 120 prints.
Pretty ambitious, but I believe in setting high targets!
 
Like what you've heard so far?
Pledges start from as little as £2, even this small amount would help to boost the project and move me closer to my goal. But you want to be rewarded, right? Here are the rewards that are up for grabs, all with free worldwide postage!

What's Next?
Ahead of me now is the proofing of the full suite of images to get them all ready for printing. The proofing and test printing process are crucial steps in the printing workflow that could make or break the final product. Very slight tweaks in aspect ratio could see essential elements of the image cropped from the overall image and spoil the final presentation.
There is also the biggest bane of a photographers life, color space. The colors you see on your digital viewing screen are not quite the same as the color space available by photographic printers, and so careful management of the color is required to get the final print as close to that seen on a digital screen. This is done through simulating the paper type and making fine-tune adjustments to the colors until there is a match, or as close as possible to the on-screen original.
I have already assessed the colours on the small test prints, but before I go to full print I need to order full-size artist proofs of each image to 100% validate the print quality. This could require multiple test prints until the image is right and poses a big risk to my project if I fail to get this right; I couldn't offer a product for sale if it was anything less than perfect. I am well-read on the subject of color space, have experience in printing and work with a world-class print lab, so I am confident that the final product will be of exceptional quality. 
All being well, I will be ordering the prints near the completion of the campaign, signing them and packing them ready to send to my supporters. I am hoping to have the final product in the hands of backer by early November, give or take a week or two. 
There is a chance that we don't hit the funding goal of course, but that's ok. This campaign is flexible, so regardless of the amount raised your reward will be honored. Failing to meet the funding goal will just mean that I have to scale back on the range of images included in this initial collection. Should any images from this collection not be chosen as rewards they'll be placed on the back burner to reduce my overall project cost in line with the total amount pledged. 
 
The work doesn't stop there...
 
When the campaign has run its course, my prints will go 'InDemand', so if you miss a chance to pledge during the funding process the images will still be offered for sale from this page. 
For me, I still have a lot of work to do! To launch the official sale of these prints  I will need to do a product photoshoot for each of the shots and create my listings ready to share to the world. I intend to sell these prints through my Esty store, social media and of course my personal website. I can see this process taking me up to Christmas this year, which if everything comes together will mean that I will meet the objective I set myself at the beginning of the year, and finally launch these limited edition prints!

These images from all of the top events attended by the CelebrityVibe Corp are not intended for personal use, as a matter of fact, they are being distributed to websites, newspapers, television programs, advertisements, and wireless applications around the globe. CelebrityVibe features an immeasurable library that is filled to the brim with diverse content from Vanity Fair Oscar Party to Bill Clinton 65th Birthday, amfAR Charity Events to the Cannes Film Festivals alongside many others. OUR TEAM AND OUR STORYSelma Fonseca is a Brazilian born photo journalist and the author of countless Billboard Magazine articles and interviews with Yoko Ono, Kelsea Ballerini, One Republic, DJ Zedd, Big Sean, Wiz Khalifa, Ty Dolla $ign, Florida Georgia Line, DJ Steve Aoki and J. Sutta, to name a few. Whether at the Grammys or Oscar parties, award ceremonies, charity events, or aboard the biggest yachts, Selma is always with the most elite jet setters.

You can visit her website www.SelmaFonseca.com Jeffery Dread, is a Haitian born event photographer and PoP Artist .  Jeffery worked as a taxi driver and to further supplement his cash inflow, he also doubles as a party promoter for some of the best night clubs in New York City and South Beach Miami. In the course of promoting shows for clubs, his side hustle career path brought him in contact with several A-list celebrities, the movers and shakers of the political scene as well as other dignitaries. Not only do their paths cross, but, a spark was created and that spark was the foundation where the friendship of Jeffrey and the many celebrities he has encountered was built on. Being an achiever, someone with big dreams, Jeffery wanted to do more with his life and, in the year 1999, all he wanted to do was document his unique lifestyle which was why he co-founded CelebrityVibe Corp.a celebrity photography company that focuses on and brings to the public all the happenings in town ranging from celebrity parties, to events, and award shows. This was no small feat and as at the time Jeffery decided to work on his idea with one other person, it was much of a big deal, a factor which brought about all the major magazines, newspapers, television networks as well as blogs all over the world to the table, they all wanted to have exclusive access to the photos Jeffery and his team had taken on those exclusive parties. Jeffery's efforts to document the life of some of the most popular people on the country brought global recognition to his country of origin - Haiti. As an artist and philanthropist, Jeffery was commissioned by The Kennedy Family and The White House Jeffery Dread's artworks are unlike the ordinary ones that can be seen in regular places like the coffee shop across the street and the Pizza Hut, but his artworks adorn and sit graciously in the homes of celebrities like Jamie Foxx, Paris Hilton and Lionel Richie.  What does This funding mean for us?A few of the many reasons why we are keen and hell bent on making donations towards people with cancer is the fact that my partner lost her sister to the terminal illness and her mom is currently undergoing treatment for the same terminal illness that killed the sister, this is the more reason why we have a big heart towards donating to cancer patients.We are gearing this crowd funding campaign towards the publication of a photobook - Hollywood Exclusives Before Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Selfies""  This 25 page retrospective photobook is the creation of an effort to celebrate the company - www.celebrityvibe.com - 20th anniversary while also providing a highlight of all the major celebrity parties in Hollywood.The logic behind this crowd funding is simple,ANYONE CAN GET FEATURED ! With hundreds of celebrities gracing our titles, and thousands of pictures from every major Celebrity event you can think of, you can imagine this photobook is no small milestone for us.It doesn't matter if you are paying to have a picture of yourself in the book or you are paying to have your significant other or other people you deeply care about in it, what matters is the motive behind paying $99 to have them there. If you cannot find a reason to pay this money to have a picture of yourself or a loved one there, we'll give you some to think about; this book is a great valentine's day or birthday gift and, it is also a great way to give your loved ones a pleasant surprise for the bragging rights of having your picture or theirs in a book that features A-List American celebrities. What do you get?When you contribute towards this photobook you are not only paying to have a desired picture(s) in the photobook but you are also helping to celebrate a well-known digital photo agency as well as contributing to a greater cause such as helping women living with cancer in Haiti. And of course you get to enjoy an array of exclusive perks featured on our Indiegogo campaign.Also contributors enjoy unique perks:- 10% of all funds raised goes to helping Haiti through the Innovating Health International (IHI) Innovating health international (IHI) is a non-profit based organization that is dedicated to the treatment of chronic diseases especially in women living in developing countries. “Our plan to work with local partners is as a result of our intention to increase the access to treatment and education services for terminal diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and injuries.“Our current projects towards achieving this goal include a Women's Cancer Centre, a large cancer awareness program, a pathology laboratory and aiding the conception of a National Comprehensive Cancer program.“IHI has since its inception in June 2013 treated over 2000 women with breast cancer and the agency is currently implementing a program that will help detect and treat early cervical cancer, located at the 10 regional hospitals of Haiti. Through this program, we screened over 10000 women in 2018 and hope to screen more than 10,000 in 2019. With local partners, we have combined global health expertise with cutting edge design methods and practices to create a women’s cancer communication tool-kit for health workers. “IHI has also designed an engagement curriculum to train health agents in Port-au-Prince which can then be replicated around the country. The tools can be viewed online at kanseayiti.com.  IHI and the Ministry of Health have opened the only public pathology lab outside of Port au Prince. IHI has completed the largest study in any low-income country to date on chronic disease, including epidemiology data on all the most prominent non-communicable diseases and their risk factors.  IHI is currently investigating the use of community-health workers to help patients better manage their diabetes.“IHI is always in need of basic medical supplies like gloves, gauze, IV tubing, tape, etc and basic medications for pain, nausea, heartburn, and allergies. We also need specialized cancer equipment like core needle biopsies, LEEP generators, and colposcopies. We can always use volunteer surgeons who can help perform mastectomies, radical hysterectomies, and breast reconstruction. We are also asking volunteers to help train our local staff so the need will grow smaller over time.” I believe that, with your compassion, willingness to help and sacrifice, together we can overcome anything we set our hearts on. We've Come So FarThe crowdfunding is an important one because it helps to celebrate the concept of creation, not just any creation, but one that survived through thick and thin over the years. Most importantly, this photobook is to celebrate partnership with whom I started from scratch with, Selma Fonseca - www.selmafonseca.com and a great way to give back to give back to the less privileged women  in the Haiti societies who are suffering from terminal cancer, 10% of this crowdfunding turnout will be towards that cause.  By funding our photobook you will help give anyone who cares a golden opportunity to be part of Hollywood's history and show great human concern for a cause that has been helping to take care of women with cancer in Haiti! Thank you for your support.

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518815466/pwugfyqf7fhw8swbb4tt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am a photographer based in Cologne/Germany and have worked in the past 25 years as editorial and corporate photographer regulary for big magazines as GEO, Time-Magazine, Stern, Chrismon, Die Zeit, Der Spiegel and others. During my professional career, I´ve won some great and prestigious prices, like a World Press Photo Award in 2007.</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of interesting places and people but one place never let go of my mind: Auroville, a small town, almost hidden in the south Indian jungle. A place in this world of turmoil, dedicated to peace and progressive harmony with over 3.000 citizens from more than 50 nations living together. No town mayor, no police. Almost like an anarchy. Why do people leave their homelands, burn bridges to start a new life in a new society? How is it to be born and grow up in Auroville. Is youth there like it is in the West? And: what has been achieved in the 50 years since it´s foundation 1968? Can we learn from the Aurovilians? And, if so, what?</p>
<p>So I came to the conclusion, that a simple magazine story on the City Of Dawn doesn´ t do it justice. The complexity of lives there just cannot fit into a couple of doublepages. </p>
<p>So I knew, I had to make a book. A book that works on different layers: emotion, understanding, questioning. to tell a riddle but not completely solve it.</p>
<p>I have portrayed around 25 Aurovilians and listened to their stories, their ideas about society and the goods and bads in their intentional community. Is there something we can learn from them? The portraits and the transcribed interviews will be in the book. <a href=""https://vimeo.com/256146256"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Like Marissa and Andy, whom´s video you can see here.</a></p>
<p>The photos will also be accompanied by texts and reportages by the authors Joerg Heuer, Peter Brinkemper, Maddy Crowell and others. Some straight, some funny or intellectual.</p>
<p>To create a physical book is so much more complex and expensive than taking pictures. You need people that want to get paid: translators, graphic designers, editors and publishers. Unless they are really crazy for you, they do it... for money. A graphic-designer and layouter will charge around 3.000 Euros, the translator for some texts another 1.000-1.500 Euros. Printing costs will be 6.000 Euros. And last not least, Indiegogo also takes it´s share of  5% from all the money that comes in.</p>
<p>This book is important as it can make Auroville known to a much broader audience as it has now. Most books on Auroville have been made for a too small group of readers. </p>
<p>""Good Morning Auroville"" will have 200+ pages, with around 125 photographs plus texts, a size of about 20x30cm and will be a joy to look at. The selection of photos, texts and layout are 80% ready. Some excerpts of the dummy you can see here (the final book will look a bit different):</p>
<p><a href=""https://issuu.com/davidklammer/docs/auroville_issuu_3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>""GOOD MORNING AUROVILLE"" PROTOTYPE   </strong></a>(you might have to click away some advertising from <i>issuu</i>)</p>
<p>By helping me to finance the designing and printing costs of this book you will create a reading tool to get deeper into the structures and layers of a society difficult to understand for an outsider. As this book is made to reach many international readers for the best price possible so far it will only be available in english language.</p> <h2>What you give and what you´ll get</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518815363/tgie2cdfwawyxqoyaefg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you give money, you´ll get something in return. A simple book or a special collector´s edition with all the bells and whistles. Some of the perks seem to be very expensive, but all of them will finance the high costs of producing the book. And most of them will not be on sale afterwards, like the special editions and their content (beside the book itself).</p>

<p>You might have asked yourself, what does this book-title mean? A greeting? A wakeup call?</p>
<p>In fact it is a quote from Johnny, one of Auroville´s oldest and best known citizens, famous for a lot of things. In the early years of the <i>City Of Dawn</i>, when there were no schools, some children asked him to teach them. He began by doing theater exercises, called ""Good Morning Auroville"". The kids from then on came very morning. And so their school started.</p>
<p>It´s all about learning....</p>

The Project

I am a photographer based in Cologne/Germany and have worked in the past 25 years as editorial and corporate photographer regulary for big magazines as GEO, Time-Magazine, Stern, Chrismon, Die Zeit, Der Spiegel and others. During my professional career, I´ve won some great and prestigious prices, like a World Press Photo Award in 2007.
I have seen a lot of interesting places and people but one place never let go of my mind: Auroville, a small town, almost hidden in the south Indian jungle. A place in this world of turmoil, dedicated to peace and progressive harmony with over 3.000 citizens from more than 50 nations living together. No town mayor, no police. Almost like an anarchy. Why do people leave their homelands, burn bridges to start a new life in a new society? How is it to be born and grow up in Auroville. Is youth there like it is in the West? And: what has been achieved in the 50 years since it´s foundation 1968? Can we learn from the Aurovilians? And, if so, what?
So I came to the conclusion, that a simple magazine story on the City Of Dawn doesn´ t do it justice. The complexity of lives there just cannot fit into a couple of doublepages. 
So I knew, I had to make a book. A book that works on different layers: emotion, understanding, questioning. to tell a riddle but not completely solve it.
I have portrayed around 25 Aurovilians and listened to their stories, their ideas about society and the goods and bads in their intentional community. Is there something we can learn from them? The portraits and the transcribed interviews will be in the book. Like Marissa and Andy, whom´s video you can see here.
The photos will also be accompanied by texts and reportages by the authors Joerg Heuer, Peter Brinkemper, Maddy Crowell and others. Some straight, some funny or intellectual.
To create a physical book is so much more complex and expensive than taking pictures. You need people that want to get paid: translators, graphic designers, editors and publishers. Unless they are really crazy for you, they do it... for money. A graphic-designer and layouter will charge around 3.000 Euros, the translator for some texts another 1.000-1.500 Euros. Printing costs will be 6.000 Euros. And last not least, Indiegogo also takes it´s share of  5% from all the money that comes in.
This book is important as it can make Auroville known to a much broader audience as it has now. Most books on Auroville have been made for a too small group of readers. 
""Good Morning Auroville"" will have 200+ pages, with around 125 photographs plus texts, a size of about 20x30cm and will be a joy to look at. The selection of photos, texts and layout are 80% ready. Some excerpts of the dummy you can see here (the final book will look a bit different):
""GOOD MORNING AUROVILLE"" PROTOTYPE   (you might have to click away some advertising from issuu)
By helping me to finance the designing and printing costs of this book you will create a reading tool to get deeper into the structures and layers of a society difficult to understand for an outsider. As this book is made to reach many international readers for the best price possible so far it will only be available in english language. What you give and what you´ll get

If you give money, you´ll get something in return. A simple book or a special collector´s edition with all the bells and whistles. Some of the perks seem to be very expensive, but all of them will finance the high costs of producing the book. And most of them will not be on sale afterwards, like the special editions and their content (beside the book itself).
At the end you´ll get something more beside holding some paper in your hands. You´ll get the feeling, that it was also you that made this possible. Not just by your name possibly printed in the book. But because of KNOWING!
 
The Chances

In their own words Auroville is the place the earth needs. I wouldn´t say that about my upcoming book. But the world needs to know about this place. And about the chances to live a different life successfully. This book is a medium to reach out by not trying to teach. It´s a book about dedicated people and the place they have created by themselves through 50 years of struggle and hard work.
Some years back I have successfully crowdfunded another book together with 8 other photographers. It´s interesting how much energy, how much input and discussion arises out of such a campaign. How a crowd can be involved and interact and participate. This alone is an adventure!
 
The Risks
What are the risks in supporting my bookproject? I have worked hard the last two years on this project, travelled to Auroville three times and stayed there for three months. I burn for making ""Good Morning Auroville"" this year, as it is the most beautiful and complete project I´ve ever photographed. And the process of making the book is in a stage of no return!  My project has gained already a great audience  and reputation. It has won the 1st price at Kolga Photofestival in ""Concept Photography"" category 2017 and was shortlisted on two major photobook-dummy-awards. Now, with the real book, this road will come to a good end.

<p>My name is Barbara Diener and I am an artist, mainly working in lens-based media. I hold a BFA from the California College of the Arts and an MFA from Columbia College Chicago, both in Photography. My work has been widely exhibited and book-making has been in integral part of my artistic practice.

<p>In my previous work I photographed in small, rural towns that triggered childhood memories. During that process I met and became fascinated with a woman named Kathy. She owns the diner in town and lives on her husband’s family farm, which is haunted by his ancestors. Her belief in the spectral sparked my own interest in the unexplained and ties back to my ongoing curiosity about religion, spirituality and the human desire to believe that something else happens after we die and that a part of us, the spirit or soul, continues on.</p>
<p>The camera is a crucial tool for most paranormal investigators, so it was a natural step for me to become an amateur ghost hunter myself. Photography has been linked to the spirit world since the 1860s with the popularity of spirit photography and post-mortem portraits. Since its invention photography has lent a sense of immortality to its subjects. In recent years the paranormal received amplified media attention through numerous 'reality' television programs that sensationalized any experiences for the camera. On the contrary my approach is self-reflective and curious. To make the resulting images I adopt both traditional and contemporary approaches of capturing the invisible, as well as my own interpretation of the magical and mystical.</p>

My work has been widely exhibited and book-making has been in integral part of my artistic practice. I am currently the Collection Manager in the Department of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago and teach photography at Oakton Community College and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Last fall I met with Michael Itkoff, co-founder of Daylight Books and he saw the potential of turning my body of work Phantom Power into a book. As you may know finding a publisher to produce a beautiful and well-crafted photography book is only half the battle. The artist is expected to contribute a significant amount of their own money and that is why I am asking for your help. For more information about Phantom Power, please read my project statement below or visit my website:
http://www.barbaradienerphotography.com/phantom-power/
For the past year I have been working with Daylight Books to publish Phantom Power. We are currently in the midst of designing, editing and sequencing and the book will be released in June 2018.
This campaign is an excellent way to pre-order the book, as a signed copy is one of the perks for your contribution. Furthermore you can receive limited edition fine prints of my photographs.
Your contribution is crucial and offsetting to this fundraising campaign and it will go directly to Daylight Books towards the cost of production.

If you are not able to make a financial contribution but still want to support this campaign, spread the word and please use Indiegogo's share tools to publish it on your various social media sites.
Phantom Power
In my previous work I photographed in small, rural towns that triggered childhood memories. During that process I met and became fascinated with a woman named Kathy. She owns the diner in town and lives on her husband’s family farm, which is haunted by his ancestors. Her belief in the spectral sparked my own interest in the unexplained and ties back to my ongoing curiosity about religion, spirituality and the human desire to believe that something else happens after we die and that a part of us, the spirit or soul, continues on.
The camera is a crucial tool for most paranormal investigators, so it was a natural step for me to become an amateur ghost hunter myself. Photography has been linked to the spirit world since the 1860s with the popularity of spirit photography and post-mortem portraits. Since its invention photography has lent a sense of immortality to its subjects. In recent years the paranormal received amplified media attention through numerous 'reality' television programs that sensationalized any experiences for the camera. On the contrary my approach is self-reflective and curious. To make the resulting images I adopt both traditional and contemporary approaches of capturing the invisible, as well as my own interpretation of the magical and mystical.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to learn what this project is all about!</p><p>First and foremost, a little bit about myself! I am a wife and mother of three (all girls) and my family and I currently reside in New Mexico. I am a photographer and makeup artist who also works in theatre and performing arts and additionally has background in corrections and social work. Like many others, I am also a fan of music of all kinds, and of Phish, which is, as you may be able to guess, a large part of what has led me to creating this project and, ultimately, this campaign.</p><p>On my way home from Phish at Dicks Sporting Goods Park last September with my husband, I began developing this idea and just a few short months later, it is beginning to come to life with almost ONE HUNDRED women already involved! So, what exactly is Music Empowering Women: A Photographic Anthology? Well, let me tell you!!</p><p>In its final form, Music Empowering Women: A Photographic Anthology will be a coffee table style book that celebrates the beauty of community and seeks to empower women through music, specifically through the Phish FAN community which is what has brought us all together. In my own love of music, I have found an incredible and close-knit community of amazing people that share this common interest. This book will feature over 100 women portraying related themes and sharing what this music and this community means to them. It is meant to be sexy, but classy with no nudity, and will feature female fans from all around the country, as well as artists and vendors of various types who will be featured alongside the models. All of the creative concepts are my own and I will be traveling to multiple locations throughout the U.S. to meet with the women involved and do each photo shoot. I will personally be doing all the photography as well as styling, hair and makeup for each shoot. As of this time, over 40 shoots have been completely outlined and I am in the process of outlining the remaining themes and getting them paired with each model in preparation to complete them. At its conception, I only ever imagined up to around 50 women being involved, but since then the number has grown significantly due to an outpouring of support and interest in the project. And because of the momentum we have propelling us at this point, now is exactly right time to be launching our crowdfunding campaign!<br/> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>I know. I’ve set my goal high. I want to raise $10,000. To me, $10,000 is a LOT of money, which is why I’ve gone back and forth endlessly on whether or not I should try to fund it one piece at a time or just kind of go for it and…go big or go home, as they say, so I’m shooting for the stars here! This goal would enable us to complete this project in its entirety, so if it could be reached we would be able to complete it from start to finish, including publication! After talking to some others involved in the project and really breaking down that number and considering what it would take in terms of crowdfunding to reach that goal, we decided this was the right move.</p><p>So, here’s the breakdown.</p><p>How many people would it take to reach this huge goal and completely fund this project?</p><p>Breaking it down into the low average of donation increments, it would take…<br/><br/><strong>400</strong> people donating <strong>$25</strong></p><p><strong>200</strong> people donating <strong>$50</strong></p><p>or <strong>100 </strong>people donating <strong>$100</strong>!</p><p>And here’s what this funding is going to help us do:</p><p>Funding in the first phase of the project will be used for three primary costs: props and costuming, travel and equipment.   </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Props and Costuming: </strong>Many props and costumes will be provided but there are also some very specific things that are needed for each shoot; props and costumes will be streamlined as much as possible so that items can be used multiple times in any instances possible to save on cost. No shoot will cost more than $100 in its entirety and most are significantly lower.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Travel:</strong> Primary travel cost will be airfare and/or ground travel to multiple shoot locations throughout the United States, with some local transportation costs in each location and the possibility of hotel expense should the need arise, though we are focusing on limiting accommodations needed in every way possible. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment: </strong>While I have all the necessary basic equipment to be able to complete the project, there are a couple of items that I would like to be able to utilize to significantly improve the quality of the final product. These items include:<ul>
<li>A laptop or tablet that will allow me to function easily on the go both at shoots and between. I already have all the editing software I will be using, but need a portable device to be able to complete these tasks as needed.</li>
<li>A wireless camera remote.</li>
<li>Portable light reflector.</li>
<li>Basic studio lighting set up with backdrop stand, plain backdrop and soft box lights.</li>
<li>Hair and makeup necessities; this is specifically in reference to eyeliner and mascara that will be used for each model because these items cannot be shared or reused with more than one person for safety purposes as well as the possibility of needing a range of foundation colors and a couple of simple but good quality hair styling tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p><i>Note: Equipment is being considered the third tier of importance in terms of what this funding will be used towards. While I will ultimately use funding if there are necessary items that I cannot otherwise obtain, I am working towards obtaining them outside of this funding. That said, I am absolutely open to donations of any equipment items on the list of needs, as well as airline miles for travel if this is something someone has available to utilize as a non-monetary donation. If someone has one of these items that they would be willing to donate, please feel free to contact me about that specifically! </i></p><p>The second phase of the project will be publication, marketing and some distribution. I already have a source aligned for this phase of the project. It will include running a test copy of the final publication, initial print run with copies for all those who will immediately receive one (models, partner project donors and several key community members), online distribution through multiple channels including Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, shipping costs and all necessary social media marketing for successful distribution of the publication.</p><p><strong>So, what do you get out of donating to this project? </strong></p><p>Besides supporting this amazing group of women and the satisfaction of knowing you are helping create something incredible and being able to see it come to fruition, there are some awesome perks for you to look forward to as a contributor! This includes everything from personalized thank you's, recognition in the book and funder updates throughout the project to signed copies of the book and special gifts from our sets! Every dollar helps towards ensuring that we have the appropriate resources we need to make this project a reality!<br/> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>While this project is all about positivity and I don’t really believe there are any risks associated, there may be a couple of challenges and I do want to briefly address what those challenges are and how those challenges will be addressed along the way.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Amount of Work to be Completed</strong>: This project involves a lot of work and because it is a huge undertaking, there are many steps to get it from start to finish. The process involves planning and outlining, obtaining all necessary items to complete each shoot, traveling and working with each model to complete their shoot, processing and editing images and preparing them for publication, designing and editing publication and publication and marketing. As the person who conceptualized this project and who will be completing it entirely, this amount of work could potentially become overwhelming. To overcome this, I am trying to be overly organized and take the project one step at a time to ensure that I am not trying to tackle too many tasks as one time. In addition, if funding were to allow, I could potentially utilize an assistant to help with the execution of shoots and possibly with other aspects of the project.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Coordinating Travel</strong>: Coordinating travel with over 100 women to complete over 100 individual photo shoots can be a daunting task. If funding for travel is not an issue, this is overcome simply by communicating with those involved to coordinate when these shoots can be completed. At this time, to coordinate all aspects of this project, we are working through a private Facebook group, email and phone if and when necessary, so we have very thorough routes of communication and will continue to utilize these throughout the entirety of this project.</li>
</ul><p>Ultimately, having funding available is the number one thing that will help to overcome the challenges in this process because it means the resource is available for completing each task.<br/> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>The difference that your contribution to this project will make is absolutely enormous, but it is not the difference of this project happening or not happening. I believe in this project and will complete it no matter how long it takes or what challenges I face along the way. However, your contribution plays an enormous role in the success of this project because COMMUNITY is its entire foundation. So, through your contribution, what impact are you really helping us make in this community?</p><p>You are helping support the empowerment of women from all backgrounds; women who are mothers and who are teachers and who are entrepreneurs and who are artists. Women who are unique. Women who are strong. Women who are role models. You are helping us shatter glass ceilings. And while we are shattering glass ceilings, you are helping us shatter stereotypes not only about women but about who all the people in this community really are!<br/> </p><p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>We fully understand that you may want to support the project but cannot contribute financially. You are among the most important of our supporters because what you can do is the largest component to successfully funding the project: SPREAD THE WORD! Use the share tools and make some noise about our campaign!</p></div>","Short SummaryMy name is Sophia Callisto and I am here to introduce you to my project, Music Empowering Women: A Photographic Anthology!!

As a photographer I am observing the devastating environmental development and started documenting the hemp plant, which has empowered concerned people worldwide, to take action.<br/><br/>Hemp’s capacity to clean polluted soil, remove high quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and grow without the use of pesticides, makes it the ideal plant for an already stressed environment facing population growth. Understanding that it provides us with biodegradable, nontoxic raw-material for food, medication, building material and textiles, is a fundamental step towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>My greater goal with publishing this book is to further educate a wider audience about Cannabis Sativa, which is hemp's botanical name. It is ignorance and propaganda that has made hemp the world's most forbidden plant. I truly hope my book will break some of the myths surrounding this controversial plant.<br/><br/><br/><u><strong><i>WHY HEMP?</i></strong></u> </p><p>The lack of knowledge about this plant is caused by more than 70 years of prohibition. During this time, hemp was reduced to a drug. “Marijuana“, focusing only on the negative side of its psychoactive ingredient THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), all the positive attributes were forgotten. What most people do not know is that hemp and cannabis are the same thing. What differentiates industrial hemp from recreational cannabis is the THC content.<br/><br/>Here are some hard-facts to consider when we take a look at industrial hemp:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539684331/qc1mfqn5dffirwlglmkl.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539684201/oeg7rva1m03yfczyoeo2.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539684351/kc9qoty9aavo3drd6a8l.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539685508/ngiqenoyk2oiw59xyn3e.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539685525/usnmvuddkgkovklbhi37.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539685978/uffcytkryasvfpv9cdbb.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539690880/bzuwo4hcazq2ibdttnki.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539690896/ix9bnkmtlsggboqthqlk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><br/><u><i><strong>HOW WILL THIS BOOK MAKE A DIFFERENCE?</strong></i></u></p><p><strong>Words can speak to our conscious minds and when they sound too good, we don’t want to believe them. Hemp is one of those plants that has virtually endless applications, which sometimes makes it difficult to grasp is multi-functionality. That is why I have travelled 17 countries, so far, to find visual proof to spread the word about hemp.</strong><br/><br/>To make this project possible I terminated my lease 2,5 years ago and made the car my new home. Since, I‘ve driven through large parts of Europe and beyond, documenting the work of the hemp pioneers growing the crop for food, textile and building materials, meanwhile discovering the positive side-effects on the environment. Also I am portraying the young, yet thriving industries which are starting to build up around the plant. Its versatile use can easily get very confusing to onlookers, who get discouraged by the complexity of the products that follow the simple act of cultivating hemp.<br/><br/>The book is seeking answers to the many questions we have about hemp and cannabis, which are left unanswered by the widely spread media, which still tends to confuse facts and give one-sided reports on the plant.<br/><br/>My quest is to make a holistic and honest statement about hemp, that will include all parts from its history, prohibition and industrial use, to medicinal and leisure. This is a visually compelling and an emotionally strong photographed documentation. My personal field reports will be backed by expert voices from the industry, who have formulated scientific texts, broken down to readable content.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540142309/dyx988ilogkyk2wnwxbj.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Hemp harvest from <a href=""https://www.hempfortex.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>Hempfortex</strong></u></a> in North China.</p><p><br/><u><i><strong>WHAT WILL THE BOOK LOOK LIKE?</strong></i></u></p><p><strong>“Hemp: Seed for a new world“</strong> is the current working title of the book.

The help that I have been offered ranged from safe places to park my car, all the way to offering me insight into the world of hemp, cannabis and marijuana.

As a photographer I am observing the devastating environmental development and started documenting the hemp plant, which has empowered concerned people worldwide, to take action.Hemp’s capacity to clean polluted soil, remove high quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and grow without the use of pesticides, makes it the ideal plant for an already stressed environment facing population growth. Understanding that it provides us with biodegradable, nontoxic raw-material for food, medication, building material and textiles, is a fundamental step towards a more sustainable future.My greater goal with publishing this book is to further educate a wider audience about Cannabis Sativa, which is hemp's botanical name. It is ignorance and propaganda that has made hemp the world's most forbidden plant. I truly hope my book will break some of the myths surrounding this controversial plant.WHY HEMP? The lack of knowledge about this plant is caused by more than 70 years of prohibition. During this time, hemp was reduced to a drug. “Marijuana“, focusing only on the negative side of its psychoactive ingredient THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), all the positive attributes were forgotten. What most people do not know is that hemp and cannabis are the same thing. What differentiates industrial hemp from recreational cannabis is the THC content.Here are some hard-facts to consider when we take a look at industrial hemp:HOW WILL THIS BOOK MAKE A DIFFERENCE?Words can speak to our conscious minds and when they sound too good, we don’t want to believe them. Hemp is one of those plants that has virtually endless applications, which sometimes makes it difficult to grasp is multi-functionality. That is why I have travelled 17 countries, so far, to find visual proof to spread the word about hemp.To make this project possible I terminated my lease 2,5 years ago and made the car my new home. Since, I‘ve driven through large parts of Europe and beyond, documenting the work of the hemp pioneers growing the crop for food, textile and building materials, meanwhile discovering the positive side-effects on the environment. Also I am portraying the young, yet thriving industries which are starting to build up around the plant. Its versatile use can easily get very confusing to onlookers, who get discouraged by the complexity of the products that follow the simple act of cultivating hemp.The book is seeking answers to the many questions we have about hemp and cannabis, which are left unanswered by the widely spread media, which still tends to confuse facts and give one-sided reports on the plant.My quest is to make a holistic and honest statement about hemp, that will include all parts from its history, prohibition and industrial use, to medicinal and leisure. This is a visually compelling and an emotionally strong photographed documentation. My personal field reports will be backed by expert voices from the industry, who have formulated scientific texts, broken down to readable content.Hemp harvest from Hempfortex in North China.WHAT WILL THE BOOK LOOK LIKE?“Hemp: Seed for a new world“ is the current working title of the book. The anticipated date of publication is set for early 2020.The format will contain;- Approximately 270 pages, printed on environmentally friendly paper and sandwiched between a hemp paper cover and ornamental pages.- Besides the ecologically friendly version with only partial use of hemp paper, there will also be a collectors limited edition. This will be a handprinted book on hemp paper from cover to back of the book.Even though this will be an incredibly expensive book, it will be proof that there is no industry that is excluded from becoming truly green. We just need to create more demand for hemp paper, in this case, to get more affordable prices again.In order to make this book, partially and entirely out of hemp, I am happy to announce the collaboration with Europe's only manufacturer for commercially-printable hemp paper, Gmund.My ambition is to find the most sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce this book. As bookmaking is already a very expensive undertaking, this book will put me on the edge of the possible. I still have a long list of countries, which offer exclusive insights on how to use hemp industrially and for medicinal purposes. As I am still self-financing the project, I don’t want to run the risk of having to cut corners at the end of the production.That is why I'm asking for your monetary help, so I could visit the places below for the book:By preordering your copy of the book now by using the ""perk"" section, you can secure some special offers, only available during the crowdfunding-campaign, and help me buffer some of the high costs of self-publication in advance. THE PERKSI hope that you are now enthusiastic enough about hemp to support my project. On the upper right side of this crowdfunding-campaign you can check out the different perks and bundles to support the project.The limited edition photography print will be printed on a Fine Art archival paper, size 28x21 cm, and will be signed and personally checked before shipping out to you!If you can’t purchase a perk, but are savvy on social-media you can always contribute by sharing the link to the crowdfunding campaign with all your friends and supporters. Also if you happened to live in any of the countries I wish to visit and can offer a couch, I will be very grateful.Let's make hemp grow worldwide again!IT FEELS GOOD TO SAY THANK YOU!On a project of this length and scope as my hemp project, one is solo on the trips and behind the camera, but never alone!It is for the open doors and this friendly welcomes amongst the “hemp-community“ worldwide, that I was able to explore in remote regions of 17 countries so far. The help that I have been offered ranged from safe places to park my car, all the way to offering me insight into the world of hemp, cannabis and marijuana. It took equally trust from the industries making final products from industrial hemp, as for an individual showing me their illegally grown indoor plantation of marijuana. Though all aspects are adding up to the whole story I am telling.Therefore a huge and humble THANK YOU to all of you, who became part of my story, and ultimately also a part of my life!Having a sponsor like F-stop backing me with an international support-network and great equipment wherever I am, is a blessing. Thank you to f-stop and the pro-ambassador team! Amongst the many people guiding me through the final stage of getting the crowdfunding-campaign up and running, I want to reach out to the Swedish production team, Guerilla Tactics Entertainment for help on the concept and Chris Westerström for making a slick film from all the individual material I brought back from all the trips. WHO AM I: MAREN KRINGS?After all the pitching it is only fair of me to introduce myself.I am a German-born photographer, with tendencies to be a global nomad.

Le foto raccontano una civiltà ancora a contatto con la natura, che viveva di economie di sussistenza, una civiltà il quale sapere era legato alla vita e al quotidiano.

Lo fa raccontando due sentimenti: il sentimento dell'abbandono - sensazione della fine delle cose - e il sentimento dello spirito - la ricerca dell'eterno - . Un percorso che va dalla terra al cielo, alla riscoperta di un eco, della memoria dell'antico contatto con una natura selvaggia e incontaminata, con un cristianesimo che assomiglia al paganesimo dei riti misterici, attraverso una serie di fotografie in giro per i paesi e le terre abbandonate d'Abruzzo.</p>
<p>Dodici fotografie si succederanno in una sorta di Via Mariana, di pellegrinaggio sacro alla riscoperta della memoria dell'antico popolo abruzzese: ad esse saranno affiancate scatti più piccoli, dettagli, didascalie e piccoli sentieri che sviano dal percorso maggiore. Alla fine della mostra, un'installazione rievocherà l'oblio di certe fisionomie, certi volti e tratti della nostra vecchia famiglia. </p>

</div></div>","Il ViaggioA marzo 2016 sono partito  con alcuni compagni ed amici per un viaggio fotografico in Abruzzo, durante il quale ho potuto riscoprire un paesaggio dimenticato, eredità della precedente cultura contadina. Poco alla volta, ascoltando e leggendo le tracce sul panorama della nostra terra, è venuto fuori un percorso alla riscoperta di questi echi lontani della civiltà precedente all'industrializzazione: quella dei nostri avi prima della guerra e dei grandi terremoti che hanno distrutto il nostro territorio. Le foto raccontano una civiltà ancora a contatto con la natura, che viveva di economie di sussistenza, una civiltà il quale sapere era legato alla vita e al quotidiano. Dopo aver compreso  ed interiorizzato queste tracce, ho deciso di farne un progetto fotografico e di metterlo in mostra. 

 La mostra 


""Lo spirito e l'abbandono"" è una mostra fotografica: racconta l'Abruzzo abbandonato, quello della vecchia civiltà contadina che viveva a cavallo con il ventesimo secolo. Lo fa raccontando due sentimenti: il sentimento dell'abbandono - sensazione della fine delle cose - e il sentimento dello spirito - la ricerca dell'eterno - .

<div>
<i>Blurred Borders </i> is an artist-led initiative and exhibition founded by three photographers working in the documentary, fashion and fine art field. We want to shed light on the printed image as a physical object and explore new ways of displaying photography. <br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What Moves Us </h3>
</div>
<div>Caught in a net of digital information, borders of traditional photography have become blurred. Tactile romanticism and the splendour of the printed image are often forgotten. Using both old and new techniques, we would like to explore new ways of perceiving a photograph while turning the photographic medium inside out. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Exhibition </h3>
</div>
<div>We believe that the relationship between space and its photographic representation is an important factor. We want to break the rules of one-point perspective and illustrate the beauty of being able to touch and see the image as a physical object. Therefore we want to experiment with different ways of displaying conceptual, printed and material work in a physical space. Through organizing exhibitions, publications and talks we are investigating how we can provide meaning to image- making in contemporary society while embracing the physicality of the photographic art form.</div>
