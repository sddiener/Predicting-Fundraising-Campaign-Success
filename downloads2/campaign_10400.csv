My name is Caleb Green, and I'm a musician and aspiring audio engineer here in the city of Boston, Massachusetts.</strong></p><p>Music has always been one of the most important aspects of my life. From the very beginning music and art have been a medium to express emotions and feelings I felt I could not communicate with normal language. My father put a guitar in my hands at a very early age, and since then I haven't looked back. The feeling I get when playing and listening to music is like nothing else I've ever experienced. It's my passion. In college I studied audio, but the program lacked the hands-on experience I needed. I searched far and wide for other educational programs to help me take my passion for audio to the next level, and that's when I found Plaid Dog Recording's Apprentice Program.</p><p><strong>This IndieGoGo campaign is the final step toward gaining the skills I need to pursue that dream career -- and with your help, I know I can make this a reality.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523248304/opmumazooiq9wu78i2kh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522184042/lof7jpcim1yjw2gsyr9u.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>This campaign is raising funds for my apprenticeship at Plaid Dog Recording, where I would be learning from and working with Bryan Fennelly, a fantastic Boston-based producer and engineer that works with both established and up-and-coming musicians.</strong></p><p>​One of the things I'm most excited about is just how hands-on this program would be, which is the quickest, best way to learn this trade. <strong>Bryan will not just be helping me learn to produce and engineer in a state-of-the-art studio; he'll be helping me build my portfolio by creating my first professionally recorded single. </strong>Having this as part of my resume would be a game changer for me, creating bigger and better opportunities for employment once I complete this program.<br/><br/>While I've had a lot of experience in the classroom, my college program hasn't given me the hands on experience I really need to grow. This apprenticeship would include the following components to help me enter the working world as an audio professional:</p><p>1. <strong>One-on-one training workshops:</strong> Plaid Dog's training program consists of 20 comprehensive lessons taught in one-on-one workshops, which keeps this personal, tailored to me, and hands-on.

Perhaps the coolest thing about this apprenticeship is that Plaid Dog puts me to work straight away when I start the program -- and, I GET PAID for my time assisting on sessions, which means from day 1, I get to put ""Plaid Dog Assistant"" on my resume. How cool is that? This is exactly what I need to start my career.<br/>3. <strong>Hands-on recording labs:</strong> This is where I get hands-on opportunities with Plaid Dog's awesome resources, and get to work with actual bands to practice my recording skills.

<h3>Mantas True Wireless Earbuds</h3>
<p>The Mantas stream wireless audio from your phone, computer, tablet, and just about any other Bluetooth device. These are True Wireless earbuds so there are no cables anywhere.

<h3>High-Performance Never Fall Out, No-Slip Fit</h3>
<p>The Mantas are here to revolutionize your hike, workout, bike ride, and all your other activities. We made the Mantas for athletes but kept the cost down because not everyone is sponsored. These earbuds are completely wireless; there are no wires to hold you back. The secure-fit ear hooks make sure the Mantas stay put when doing what you do. We threw in multiple ear tip options for extended comfort. These lightweight earbuds are built for performance, with sweat and water resistance, so the Mantas can handle your workout. With up to 12 hours of playtime and powerful sound, you’ll always have your music or podcast to motivate you.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Pro Sound for Pro Athletes</h3>
<p>We listened to professional athletes and amateurs alike in order to create True Wireless earbuds that can stand up to the toughest workouts. Our research tells us that the sound has to be amazing, the earbuds have to be comfortable, they have to look good, and function in the toughest conditions. You want everything, no compromises, so that’s what we created. We made sure that the Mantas audio is powerful and balanced with enhanced clarity and superior dynamic range. The Mantas sound amazing.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>One Earbud or Two, The Choice is Yours</h3>
<p>With the Mantas, you can use both earbuds for stereo sound or use one earbud for mono sound. Right, left, or both, enjoy 100% control over your audio and how you listen to it. In certain situations, it can be dangerous to have two earbuds in. When riding a road bike, you want to keep the ear that is closest to the cars open. When hitting some downhill trails on your mountain bike, you should keep an ear open to listen for wildlife and anyone that might be “on your left”. Whatever the application is, staying aware and being safe is important. For safety reasons, some state and local laws prohibit the use of headsets when operating a bicycle. So you should only use the Mantas for off-highway activities and do not use the Mantas at excessive volumes because it may cause permanent hearing damage.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Enough Power for the Whole Day</h3>
<p>Wake up and run while listening to music. Commute to work listening to a podcast. Conference call during lunch. Hit the gym in the evening. The 12-hour playtime will get you through your busy, active day. If you forget to charge the Mantas at night, just plug in any micro USB cable to get full power in about an hour and a half. We also include a two-in-one split micro USB charging cable that enables you to charge both earbuds at the same time. That way you can spend less time worrying about powering up and more time powering ahead.</p>

<h3>Who is Outdoor Tech?</h3>
<p>The purpose of Outdoor Tech is to address the burning desire and need to be active in the age of mobile technology with the drive to be outdoors. It's in our DNA, it's our modus operandi that motivates every idea, every product we design and develop. We are a small team of diverse people in Southern California. The best isn't good enough, that's why we created the Mantas True Wireless earbuds.</p>

<h3>Why Do We Need Your Help?</h3>
<p>We have invested a huge amount of our resources into the development of the Mantas True Wireless earbuds. Bringing the perfect solution from idea to a physical product is time-consuming and extremely costly. We have done everything to make this product a reality but we just need a little more help to actualize the dream. So we are turning to the wonderful crowdfunding community to be our partners in this venture.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>No Risks</h3>
<p>We have taken all the risks and can't wait to deliver this amazing new product to you.</p>
</div></div>","Mantas True Wireless Earbuds
The Mantas stream wireless audio from your phone, computer, tablet, and just about any other Bluetooth device. These are True Wireless earbuds so there are no cables anywhere. Our athlete-inspired design and engineering have enabled perfect sound, sweat resistance, and an ultra-light, super comfortable, no-slip fit. The 12-hour playtime gives you plenty of time for your workout, bike ride, or run.

Incredible Features at an Unbeatable Price
We are bringing True Wireless earbuds to the masses. Our Mantas will outperform similar products at a fraction of what they cost.

What Does the Press Think?
The press loves our products and so do our customers. Check out what has been said about us and the products we create.



 
High-Performance Never Fall Out, No-Slip Fit
The Mantas are here to revolutionize your hike, workout, bike ride, and all your other activities. We made the Mantas for athletes but kept the cost down because not everyone is sponsored. These earbuds are completely wireless; there are no wires to hold you back. The secure-fit ear hooks make sure the Mantas stay put when doing what you do. We threw in multiple ear tip options for extended comfort. These lightweight earbuds are built for performance, with sweat and water resistance, so the Mantas can handle your workout. With up to 12 hours of playtime and powerful sound, you’ll always have your music or podcast to motivate you.
 

 
Pro Sound for Pro Athletes
We listened to professional athletes and amateurs alike in order to create True Wireless earbuds that can stand up to the toughest workouts. Our research tells us that the sound has to be amazing, the earbuds have to be comfortable, they have to look good, and function in the toughest conditions. You want everything, no compromises, so that’s what we created. We made sure that the Mantas audio is powerful and balanced with enhanced clarity and superior dynamic range. The Mantas sound amazing.
 

 
One Earbud or Two, The Choice is Yours
With the Mantas, you can use both earbuds for stereo sound or use one earbud for mono sound. Right, left, or both, enjoy 100% control over your audio and how you listen to it. In certain situations, it can be dangerous to have two earbuds in. When riding a road bike, you want to keep the ear that is closest to the cars open. When hitting some downhill trails on your mountain bike, you should keep an ear open to listen for wildlife and anyone that might be “on your left”. Whatever the application is, staying aware and being safe is important. For safety reasons, some state and local laws prohibit the use of headsets when operating a bicycle. So you should only use the Mantas for off-highway activities and do not use the Mantas at excessive volumes because it may cause permanent hearing damage.
 

 
Enough Power for the Whole Day
Wake up and run while listening to music. Commute to work listening to a podcast. Conference call during lunch. Hit the gym in the evening. The 12-hour playtime will get you through your busy, active day. If you forget to charge the Mantas at night, just plug in any micro USB cable to get full power in about an hour and a half. We also include a two-in-one split micro USB charging cable that enables you to charge both earbuds at the same time. That way you can spend less time worrying about powering up and more time powering ahead.
 
Personal Assistants Are A Tap Away
Getting a hold of your favorite personal assistant (Siri or Google) is just a few taps away. Just tap the left earbud 3 times and ask away. Have a text read to you, set some reminders, or make a call. All while your phone is tucked away.

 
Stable Consistent Wireless That Works
The Mantas use a premium Class 1 Bluetooth 5 chip for maximum wireless stability. The high-performance frequency range makes sure they stay connected as you and your world keep moving.

Powered by aptX

The system blends a 3¾” high-excursion subwoofer with a custom 1¾” high-sensitivity driver with a neodymium motor system. The result is a rich, high-fidelity sound that stretches from 50Hz - 20kHz. To get the most from the high-fidelity system, we’ve included aptX®, which allows for CD-quality, low latency streaming over Bluetooth.

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>Teracoustix</strong> is a result of countless trials and revisions by seasoned Chicago-based acoustic guitar enthusiasts binded with a common goal of providing a top-quality product that will make avid acoustic guitar owners enjoy playing their instrument to full potential. The Teracoustix was indeed a work in progress during the design phase. It took us 14 design revisions from idea conception to final prototype.  It only shows our keen and relentless work efforts in coming up with a truly one-of-a-kind product every guitar player will be proud to own. We have accomplished to have a tested working prototype of the product on March 2019, it was the exact representation of the product that we envisioned right from the beginning. Since our NAMM 2019 Trade Show in Nashville, we were able to even more improve two of the product features based from booth visitor feedbacks. First, by switching to another rubber material and second, by integrating wood veneers for a more customized option that matches the classic look of the guitar. Our next move is to venture to the production stage and distribute worldwide. It can only be made possible through our backers' contribution and valuable support in this campaign.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Six Useful Features That Make Teracoustix An Acoustic Guitar Must-Have Accessory</b></p>

Teracoustix is a result of countless trials and revisions by seasoned Chicago-based acoustic guitar enthusiasts binded with a common goal of providing a top-quality product that will make avid acoustic guitar owners enjoy playing their instrument to full potential. The Teracoustix was indeed a work in progress during the design phase. It took us 14 design revisions from idea conception to final prototype.  It only shows our keen and relentless work efforts in coming up with a truly one-of-a-kind product every guitar player will be proud to own. We have accomplished to have a tested working prototype of the product on March 2019, it was the exact representation of the product that we envisioned right from the beginning. Since our NAMM 2019 Trade Show in Nashville, we were able to even more improve two of the product features based from booth visitor feedbacks. First, by switching to another rubber material and second, by integrating wood veneers for a more customized option that matches the classic look of the guitar. Our next move is to venture to the production stage and distribute worldwide. It can only be made possible through our backers' contribution and valuable support in this campaign.
 

 
Six Useful Features That Make Teracoustix An Acoustic Guitar Must-Have Accessory
1. Tone Enhancer - It dampens the vibration of the top sounding board of the acoustic guitar while opening up the bass and mid voicings creating a pleasing tone-altering effect for a tighter, more focused sound ideal for playing and recording.
2. Feedback Buster - Two side air vents are pointing upward directly to the guitar player when closed to allow more of the guitar’s natural highs to come out. It prevents muffled and over- bassy sound while eliminating unwanted feedback when playing amplified.
3. Access To Soundhole Controls - After-market brands of soundhole pickup EQ and Volume controls can be accessed with ease. Some placement adjustments might be necessary.
4. As A Guitar Mute - When closed, it deadens the sound which is ideal for silent practicing.
5. As A Pick Holder  - It is the closest and quickest way to insert and access the guitar pick at an angle. A fingerstyle and picking guitarist dream when alternating between these two techniques.

<p> </p>
<p>re.corder is a new take on a traditional instrument used worldwide in schools as a simple and durable tool for music education.</p>
<p>By enclosing a simple but powerful electronic into a mute-able, fully acoustic wind instrument a whole world of functions opens up. </p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign is here to help us finalizing the industrialization phases of the re.corder allowing you to have an highly discounted unit! (20-25% for the standard edition!) from the final street price!</p>

re.corder is a new take on a traditional instrument used worldwide in schools as a simple and durable tool for music education.
By enclosing a simple but powerful electronic into a mute-able, fully acoustic wind instrument a whole world of functions opens up. 
The Kickstarter campaign is here to help us finalizing the industrialization phases of the re.corder allowing you to have an highly discounted unit! (20-25% for the standard edition!) from the final street price!
 


 

 
 

 
From enhanced school teaching, to a class re.orchestra, to an app-based virtual teacher, up to a standard MIDI controller for the  music production studio, re.corder, with is portable nature, is the instrument for everyone.
 

 
The bundled app (iOS and Android) puts several applications at your fingertips! The two UI versions (for children and for grown-up girls and boys!) put a teaching functionality, a comprehensive sound library, a multi-player (no-pun intended!) environment and a simple yet sophisticated looper to create music everywhere you are.
 

 
Some videos showing the re.corder potential. The re.corder is connected by bluetooth to the macbook. The USB cable is only for powering purposes, given that we are waiting for the custom lithium battery from the manufacturer (note of the engineering dept.!)
 

 

 

 
 


 


 
A professional player experimenting with the re.corder. Here you can see him playing it (the cable is just for powering the recorder) against several applications, from GarageBand, to Ableton Live up to playing an hardware synth (UNO Synth by IK multimedia) through the Mac used as a midi router. 


 

 

re.corder can be played in three different modes! 
 

 

Acoustically, with or without the application running, as a powerful and augmented instrument for the learning of music.
Digitally playing the re.corder (you can mute it with the supplied mute-plug) silently and using the sounds of the app's library, alone or with up to three other friends! This will allow you to to practice everywhere, day and night, without annoying anyone!
Using the re.corder as a powerful MIDI wind instrument controller. There will be also a future direct ""re.corder to analog CV/GATE/ wired MIDI interface"" for the musicians that already owns a modular synthesizer!!

 
   Soundmachines will produce a dedicated module that can integrate the recorder into a modular synthesizer, without resorting to a PC/Mac to do the routing job. Contact the manufacturer (www.sound-machines.it) directly to know more about the re.ceiver!  Inside the re.corder there is a set of technologies that works smartly and silently to achieve the functions that allows you to feel a real instrument in your hands and a powerful controller when linked to an application or a software. Please check the following infographic: The breath sensor is an high performance pressure sensing device, that can measure the strength of your blow, and transform this information into an expression parameter. This is used by the app, and most softwares, as a modifier for modulation or other sound characteristics. The mouthpiece of the re.corder can also sense your lips, understanding when you really want to play or not!Under every note hole there's a single or dual touch sensor that detect your finger and the note that you want to play. The software can be modified to swap fingering styles or to allow impaired mobility players to have their own custom fingering map.We didn't left out anything and in fact, to allow extreme expressivity and many other applications, we implemented an inertial platform with a 3D accelerometer MEMS. This sensor is capable of interpreting the movement and the attitude of the product, opening the possibility of modifying the sound following the player's gestures.Under the hood, there is a powerful MCU that reads the sensors and manages the quick BLE connectivity with the app or the host computer and software. Everything runs for several hours on battery, easily rechargeable with the standard microUSB connector. When out of juice and in desperate need to play, just connect your power bank and the re.corder will recharge itself while allowing you to play without any problems!  We thought about playing the re.corder on the bus and train, in bed and in many other situation where you don't want to annoy anyone! The re.corder comes with a mute plug (that can be linked, for safety, to the ring on the bottom) that works without changing much of the air resistance that you have when playing it acoustically. The app will be available both for iOS and Android. The app will have two different, selectable, appearances; the first particularly suited for children and the second one more oriented to young adults and musicians! The following functionality pictures shows some beta graphic pages (children version).  While all present in the delivery versions of the app, we reserve the right to change appearance and workflow of the functionalities to conjugate user-friendliness, platform-specific aspects and processing power.    One of the key points in the creation process of the re.corder has been the potential aid to special persons. Having the possibility to play something even with less than ideal execution, lack of breathing capabilities, impaired mobility or simply shifting the output frequency in the low range to suit deaf and blind-deaf persons, is equally important to us as to provide a fun and productive approach to music to the ones that doesn't have to deal with those limitations! Our vision, having the opportunity of developing something completely new,  is to be able to give this 'something' to EVERYONE. We ran a survey on the pre-launch pages and many people had the opportunity to indicate the preferred colors in a group of 8. As the campaign evolves, we will send out few more information on color bundles and other option!EXTENDED REWARDS:Printed Pattern Recorders! When we will reach 100.000€ this reward will appear. You can obviously upgrade from the standard re.corder! We will have a poll to define which patterns/motives will be printed.    As with any product, re.corder was born as a cluster of ideas, targets and technologies that were embodied in several prototypes. The next pictures will show you small glimpse of the steps we took to make the re.corder a reality!The first pic is what we dubbed the 'Ugly Duck'. A commercial recorder where we tested technologies in order to understand the feasibility of the product! Guess what the verdict have been? Well, in the last two years many other studies have been made and patents covering key aspects of the product have been deposited worldwide! The following was a first conceptualization of the electronic board of the re.corder, on which a first fully working prototype was manufactured. Still few optimizations to do, until the Kickstarter proto surfaced later this year. The Kickstarter version of the product is already a fully working, refined mechanical and electronic prototype. Starting from this, we will put in place concept and design for manufacturing approaches. Key points are sound quality, robustness, easy of manufacturing and compatibility with mobile and desktop platforms There are many activities behind a complex product, especially one that includes both hardware, software and a real-sounding musical instrument!   Behind re.corder and the company Artinoise, lies a compound industrial expertise that sums up to more than 80 man-years.  Electronic, firmware and hardware design couples tightly with human factors, mobile app development and  industrialization and production management backgrounds. We present now the core team that will bring to you the re.corder!   https://www.midifan.com/modulenews-detailview-34529.htmhttps://www.toutiao.com/i6751217421178110478/https://kontroleryzm.pl/re-corder-flet-prosty-i-kontroler-midi-w-jednym/https://ask.audio/articles/re-corder-is-the-recorder-reinvented-for-a-new-generationhttps://synthcafe.blog/2019/10/17/artinoise-re-corder-il-flauto-dolce-reinventato-in-chiave-moderna/https://www.matrixsynth.com/2019/10/artinoise-recorder.htmlhttps://newmusicalinstruments.it/2019/10/artinoise-re-corder/https://icon.jp/archives/17992https://cdm.link/2019/10/recorder-reboot/http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2019/10/18/artinoise-intros-midi-augmented-re-corder-wind-instrument/https://fr.audiofanzine.com/controleur-midi-divers/artinoise/re-corder/news/a.play,n.46262.htmlhttps://www.amazona.de/news-artinoise-rec-order-eine-digitale-floete-mit-midi/",31.0,7,"2 Campaigns

Short Summary Hi, my name is Lao Dara. I am the founder of MicroElements, and the designer of the MINI , the smallest Bluetooth earbud that fits comfortably right inside your ear.


WHAT EXACTLY IS THE MINI?The Mini is:
a single stereo high-end audio quality speaker
2.5 hours of nonstop music playing on a single charge
a unique in ear no hook design.
The MINI comes
with everything you need – an on/off button, a play/answer button, and a hidden
charging port (so you can charge it using the supplied USB cable). It also
comes with a silicon cap to ensure a comfortable placement in the ear.The Bluetooth headset with its ear hook used to look stylish – but the latest technology, represented by the MINI – is to simply have the Bluetooth inside your ear. You can talk to family and friends, and listen to music, all without having that Bluetooth headset prominently placed outside your ear.How does it look in your ear?

</h3> <p>Hi pilots!</p>
<p>I'm a software developer. My passion is to develop applications for digital simulators. One of my apps is 'Simshaker', that can work with popular simulators such as DCS World, iRacing an Assetto Corsa. SimShaker software receives row telemetry data from the simulator game and processes the data with inner logic to send vibrations to the user's body at appropriate time and place via vibrating cushion at user's chair.</p>

I know that DCS World virtual pilots who own the Gametrix vibe cushion enjoy SimShaker (formely ibaEffects) a lot. It helps them to control the aircraft by the seat of their pants. I also know that there are many pilots who don't have the Gametrix device, but do have Buttkicker-like sound mode device, and we can make those devices work with DCS World much better, using the simulator's telemetry data. Using an alernate sound device to output low freq. audio, we can feel the rumbling and vibration of the aircraft; rather than through vibration via the game sounds.<p>I love especially those takeoffs.... You are getting faster and faster along the runway, feeling the aircraft rumbling more and more.... nose gear up... and... oh my God! silence! I'm airborn!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Well, I'm almost ready to start hardcoding to make SimShaker work with Buttkicker-like devices.

 Hi pilots!
I'm a software developer. My passion is to develop applications for digital simulators.

Now Simshaker works with Gametrix vibe cushions, as you can see in the picture above. I know that DCS World virtual pilots who own the Gametrix vibe cushion enjoy SimShaker (formely ibaEffects) a lot. It helps them to control the aircraft by the seat of their pants. I also know that there are many pilots who don't have the Gametrix device, but do have Buttkicker-like sound mode device, and we can make those devices work with DCS World much better, using the simulator's telemetry data. Using an alernate sound device to output low freq. audio, we can feel the rumbling and vibration of the aircraft; rather than through vibration via the game sounds.I love especially those takeoffs.... You are getting faster and faster along the runway, feeling the aircraft rumbling more and more.... nose gear up... and... oh my God! silence! I'm airborn!   What We Need & What You Get Well, I'm almost ready to start hardcoding to make SimShaker work with Buttkicker-like devices. And to get started the project requires the following fundraising and assistance:  $560 (includes IndieGogo campaign fees) One or two beta-testers with Buttkicker-like devices
You get the chance  to enhance your DCS World immersion and take part in creative process.    The Impact 
I believe that by reaching our goal we will: 

enhance virtual pilots user experience that will bring a lot of fun and excitement;


make even more game, not war;

bring the flight sim community together, pilots from different countries, different continents.

    Risks & Challenges Yes, it's risky to try create something new and to achieve your goals. But this challenge excites me to overcome the hurdles. Below are the estimated risks of the project.

May encounter some severe technical issues - about 10 %;
You don't like at all what I implement - about 5 %; 
What should I do to solve these challenges?   
Of course I can appeal to software developers community and get nessesary help. 

Every contributor will have the opportunity to test and influence the design of the software during development process.

  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Please, help get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Please note that you will be responsible for non-refundable duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region, which in the past have ranged from 0% to 20% in the US and EU countries, to as much as 200% for certain South American countries. Estimated delivery: Each reward tier may have a different estimated shipment month. While we do not expect these to change, the estimated shipment month might shift. We will provide updates if the estimated shipment date changes. At anytime up until your headphone has shipped, you may request a full refund by emailing support@inspero.im. Warranty: We stand firmly behind our products.

The HR monitor is designed to monitor a user’s heart rate on a periodic basis. The frequency at which heart rate is measured varies and depends on the level of activity of the user. Vinci headphones are not medical devices and you should not rely on the accuracy of the heart rate data for any purpose, especially for medical or health purposes. Battery life: Actual battery life will vary based in part on cellular network performance, location, and other factors. 3rd party applications: For 3rd party applications that are not native to, or built into Vinci’s operating system -- such as Spotify -- you must already have an account set up to use these services with your Vinci device. Additional fees and costs may apply to any such services. Use of third party services is subject to these services’ own terms. Trademarks: Trademarks and names that belong to third parties. Water resistance: Vinci is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water–like unforeseeable rain–won’t ruin your device, but submerging the device is not recommended.",40.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p>Smartphone cameras have been upgraded year after year, but their mics still don’t measure up, leaving you with subpar sound on crystal-clear videos. The same goes for mics on DSLR cameras and laptops—the quality isn’t there!</p>
<p>The only way to improve sound quality is upgrading to a better microphone, but that often requires sizable funds, technical know-how and a learning curve. And on top of that, most “quality” lavalier microphones on the market have messy cords or bulky design. </p>

<p>Before Hooke Audio, creators sacrificed sound quality for utility with Bluetooth speakers and headphones that were limited to sending mono audio (3kHz – 5kHz). The only way to upgrade to stereo audio (20Hz – 20kHz) was using a more cumbersome setup with added weight and wires. Hooke saw this problem and built a <strong>custom codec that allows dual-channel streaming </strong>of high-quality audio to both Android and iOS at incredibly low latency. </p>

The Bluetooth lav has 8GB of internal storage and connects to any device with the click of a button. This slick, minimalist microphone maximizes your freedom to record with no setup necessary!  





It’s the first truly wireless device to send high quality audio over Bluetooth at low latency. The stylish, clip-on gives you professional quality audio recording in the studio, on the go and out in the wild. It eliminates wind noise, cuts the cord and, thanks to its internal storage, picks up every second of audio even if Bluetooth cuts out. 


Smartphone cameras have been upgraded year after year, but their mics still don’t measure up, leaving you with subpar sound on crystal-clear videos. The same goes for mics on DSLR cameras and laptops—the quality isn’t there!
The only way to improve sound quality is upgrading to a better microphone, but that often requires sizable funds, technical know-how and a learning curve. And on top of that, most “quality” lavalier microphones on the market have messy cords or bulky design. 

With Hooke Lav, you can skip the confusion and opt for an affordable pro-quality mic that operates with one click! 

Hooke Audio is no stranger to success in the sound engineering world. In 2014, founder Anthony Mattana had a wildly successful Kickstarter launch of Hooke Verse that raised $163,166 with 1,385 backers.

Hooke Verse headphones were flawlessly delivered to backers in 2017, and since then, Hooke Audio hasn’t stopped revolutionizing the world of mobile Bluetooth sound.






Before Hooke Audio, creators sacrificed sound quality for utility with Bluetooth speakers and headphones that were limited to sending mono audio (3kHz – 5kHz). The only way to upgrade to stereo audio (20Hz – 20kHz) was using a more cumbersome setup with added weight and wires. Hooke saw this problem and built a custom codec that allows dual-channel streaming of high-quality audio to both Android and iOS at incredibly low latency. 
Android and iOS are not (yet) natively set up to receive our proprietary Bluetooth recording codec, so we use our mobile app to make the handshake with our recording codec. The result is a fully stacked mobile app designed to change the way you record the world!Hooke Lav has just one button that’s used for powering on/off, beginning/ending recording and pairing. Plus, it automatically turns off after 10 minutes of non-use to conserve battery life. Cut the cord and slip on the smallest wearable mic that records wirelessly to any mobile device through Bluetooth 5.0. The stylish mic has 7 hours continuous recording battery life and takes less than an hour to fully charge.     Whether you need to be in the scene or on the scene, Hooke Lav ensures you get ridiculously crisp audio in one click. Hooke Lav is equipped with 8GB of internal storage, backing-up every capture in real time, so your audio is seamless even when Bluetooth is not. When a recording begins, the audio is sent to the phone or device over Bluetooth in real time, while an identical file is being written to internal storage. When a recording ends, Hooke Lav merges both audio files together for a pristine, dropout free recording.Hooke Lav uses digital, omnidirectional microphones to capture the highest-quality, noise-free sound in both the loudest and quietest environments. When you play it back, it sounds like the audio is happening right in front of you. With Hooke Lav, you don’t have to be a sound engineer to access high-quality audio equipment!Hooke Audio app for iOS and Android is the only app on the market that lets a device stream rich, dual channel, high quality audio (20Hz – 20 kHz) over Bluetooth to Android and iOS with no latency.The Hooke Audio app also doubles as a field recorder. Put your device in your pocket and record audio on the fly! Share your videos and sound recordings via email, social media and text message straight from the app. No special speakers or algorithms required.Hooke Lav was created to capture audio to your mobile device, but we know sometimes things don’t go as planned. And that’s why we created Island Mode. Island Mode lets you record hands-free, without connecting to a phone or camera. You can “unplug” from the world and still record your thoughts, songs and sounds with just a clip and a click! Hooke Lav stores the capture onboard until you’re able to connect and upload to a mobile device.You don’t do everything on a mobile device. That’s why we created Receiver Mode, allowing one LAV to receive audio from the other and transmit it directly into the audio jack of any camera. Syncing your sound directly to picture.Receiver Mode requires 2 lavs and allows you to override the internal microphone on your phone/camera/computer and record with Hooke Lav. Lav A connects wirelessly to Lav B and B pumps audio into the phone lightning port/Micro USB slot via a 3.5mm cable.Use one LAV to record alone in Solo Mode or pair with a second for 2-channel input in Duet Mode.   Duet Mode is perfect for interviews, podcasts and more. Place Hooke Lav mics on two different interviewees and record their vocals respectively, and both recordings will transmit to the smartphone in real-time, mixed together with the video automatically Whether you’re vlogging on a busy street, recording a podcast in your basement or meeting in Zoom, Hooke Lav gives you freedom to move and still be perfectly heard.  It’s ideal for:  If a device is meant to be worn, it should look like it.

Bone conduction technology is a great fit for swimmers. Instead of using the ear canal to send music to your inner ear, it takes a shortcut through your cheek and jaw bones and also will sound even better underwater!</p><h3>THE MOST DURABLE WATERPROOF HEADPHONES</h3><p>Fully enclosed in our special soft silicone, the Waterfi Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones will go deeper underwater than any waterproof earbud. The material will also protect the components against drops, shocks, snow, salt water, hot water, dirt, mud, but probably not fire. Don’t take these in a fire.</p><h3>ONE SIZE FITS IMMEDIATELY</h3><p>There are no extra tips included because there are no tips needed. Right out of the package you can slip these Waterproof Headphones under your goggle strap and dive in. No experimentation with different sizes, or jostling around trying to get them to sit correctly. The soft silicone sits securely just in front of your ear so you can swim for hours without getting that painful ear cramp that comes with having your canal jammed full of earbuds.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MammothHeartyFlyingsquirrel-size_restricted.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>CUTTING EDGE CONDUCTION TECHNOLOGY</h3><p>While creating this new set of Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones for swimmers, our design and engineering team innovated in a lot of areas.

After years banging our head against the wall trying to help our swimmers get those fiddly in-ear buds to stay in and not get waterlogged we’ve decided to sidestep the ears altogether with the new Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones.During our successful crowdfunding campaign to bring the Waterfi Swimcast to life, many of our supporters asked us to also bring bone conduction technology to the pool. They were looking for an alternative to using the in-ear buds that needed to have just the right size tip, and just the right angle, and just the right amount of headphone goop.With our special silicone molding technique making these special headphones ourselves was suddenly very possible. Bone conduction technology is a great fit for swimmers. Instead of using the ear canal to send music to your inner ear, it takes a shortcut through your cheek and jaw bones and also will sound even better underwater!THE MOST DURABLE WATERPROOF HEADPHONESFully enclosed in our special soft silicone, the Waterfi Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones will go deeper underwater than any waterproof earbud. The material will also protect the components against drops, shocks, snow, salt water, hot water, dirt, mud, but probably not fire. Don’t take these in a fire.ONE SIZE FITS IMMEDIATELYThere are no extra tips included because there are no tips needed. Right out of the package you can slip these Waterproof Headphones under your goggle strap and dive in. No experimentation with different sizes, or jostling around trying to get them to sit correctly. The soft silicone sits securely just in front of your ear so you can swim for hours without getting that painful ear cramp that comes with having your canal jammed full of earbuds.  CUTTING EDGE CONDUCTION TECHNOLOGYWhile creating this new set of Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones for swimmers, our design and engineering team innovated in a lot of areas. They surrounded the speakers with a second material for added comfort and also to help pump up the volume. PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERSThere are a few options for waterproof audio and we wanted our new Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones to work with all of them, so we built them with a gold plated 3.5mm headphone jack. You can use any waterproof MP3 player, waterproof iPod Shuffle, waterproof phone, though we would suggest you go ahead and pair it with the Waterfi Swimcast.BATTERY LIFE FOR DAYSWhen swimming with music and podcasts you may have found that that hour in the pool turns into 2 hours, 3 hours, maybe even 4 hours. We wanted to make sure these Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones will never be the reason you have to take your pruny fingers to the locker room and go home, so we included a rechargeable battery that will last over 25 hours before needing to be recharged. You can listen to every song in the Beatles catalog 3 times over before needing to grab your USB charging cord.We're ready to begin making small batches of the Waterproof Bone Conduction Headphones at our HQ in San Diego. To really begin getting these out to the pool will require some extra tooling and set up costs with a local manufacturer. With your help we can realize the dream of the most durable, hassle free waterproof headphones ever made.Founded in sunny San Diego in 2010 by Engineer Royce Nicholas, Waterfi has always been passionate about achieving the impossible: making your favorite gadgets work underwater!

However, due to different design constraints like space, interference and cost, it is hard to build a good computer or smartphone audio system. </p>
<p>USB-DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) is an elegant solution to solve this problem. By streaming raw digital audio data through USB to the USB-DAC, it bypass the internal audio system and reconstruct HiFi music externally. </p>
<p>When we look at existing USB-DAC products, they are mostly bulky and expensive. We therefore decided to build one.</p><p>ZuperDAC is a truly portable USB-DAC at only 11 cm3 and 16 gram. It is based on ESS ES9018K2M HiFi grade AudioDAC and supports USB Audio Class 2 192kHz 24-bit resolution. It supports Windows 7/8, OS X Yosemite, Ubuntu, iOS and Android*. That means you can use it anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>We would like to build HiFi audio product affordable by all music lovers. We hope that you can support our vision. ZuperDAC is now offered as a reward for the early bird adopter at $49. This is a truly portable HiFi USB-DAC that you can contribute to make it real.</p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Technical Specification</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1349336/files/20150402084644-Spec.png?1427989604"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">*Android Compatibility List</span><br/></p><p></p><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Due to segmentation of Android and the hardware design, we cannot guarantee the compatibility of ZuperDAC with every Android phone. We have tested ZuperDAC to work with the following phones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Samsung Galaxy S3/S4/S5/S6/S6 Edge</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Samsung Note 2/3/4/Edge</span></li>

<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sony Xperia Z1/Z2/Z3</span></li>
</ul>Some phones like HTC M7/M8 and Oneplus One will disable volume control at USB audio operation (Volume key can only turn on or off USB audio output). If you use it with a headphone, there is no way to control output volume level (which is set at the maximum level and may be harmful to your ears). If you connect to an external powered speaker or amplifier with volume control, it should work well.</div><div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><h1><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Frequently Asked Questions</span></h1><div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1349393/files/20150402090325-faq1.png?1427990605"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>

</div></div>","ZuperDAC, The Portable HiFi USB-DAC by Zorloo. We just want to bring HiFi music enjoyment to everyone. ZuperDAC transforms your existing PC, Mac, Android, iPhone and Raspberry Pi into a HiFi music system. Plug in ZuperDAC to a USB port and it will faithfully reproduce the music with all the details. Connect to your headphone or speaker system for great music anytime, anywhere.


Less is More



ZuperDAC measures just 46mm(L) x 23mm(W) x 10mm(H) (excluding the USB connector) and weighs only 16g. It is housed in an Aluminum casing with 2 matte color options, Gold and Silver. The Aluminum casing provides solid protection to the inside electronics as well as interference shielding. Even in such a small size, we still manage to incorporate full USB Audio Class 2 functionality, HiFi AudioDAC and Headphone Amplifier.






Anytime & Anywhere




You can carry ZuperDAC around without even noticing it. It is the perfect companion for your PC & smartphone as it instantly upgrades your audio system to HiFi quality. No matter you are at work or having fun, you can enjoy HiFi music anytime and anywhere you want. 


4x Sampling Frequency



High Definition Audio standard record music at 192kHz versus CD at 44.1kHz, meaning 4x more samples are recorded and more details are revealed. ZuperDAC supports all different sampling frequencies up to 192kHz so you can play all versions of music recording. Be it CD or High-Definition grade, you are now fully equipped.


1.5x Bit-Depth Resolution


Regular CD recording uses only 16-bit representation for each channel but latest recording technology has been beefed up to High-Definition 24-bit. It is like measuring with a higher precision ruler. ZuperDAC supports up to 24-bit and you can now enjoy all the latest High Definition music without compromise.


World Class HiFi AudioDAC



The AudioDAC is the mastermind in the USB-DAC design. At ZuperDAC, we used the best HiFi grade ESS Sabre ES9018K2M AudioDAC. With its patented 32-bit Hyperstream DAC architecture and Time Domain Jitter Eliminator, it faithfully reconstructs the original music.  You will be surprised to find all the details you have missed before.

Integrated Headphone Amplifier




A USB-DAC won't be complete without a good headphone amplifier. ZuperDAC uses the latest ESS ES9601 headphone driver. It delivers unmatched performance for audio headphone or line-out output. With its pop-noise suppression design, you are free of any unwanted power-up and power-down noise. You can just plug in your headphone and immerse in HiFi music.



Multi-Platform Support







ZuperDAC is fully compatible with USB Audio Class 2 (192kHz, 24-bit) specification. That means it is plug and play compatible with Mac OS X and Ubuntu. Windows default only support USB Audio Class 1 (96kHz, 24-bit) and we provide USB Audio Class 2 driver for Windows to unleash ZuperDAC full potential. By using an OTG cable, you can connect ZuperDAC to Android mobile phone (if it supports OTG and USB Audio, see our compatibility list*). For iOS mobile phone, you can use the Apple Lightning to USB Camera adapter to connect ZuperDAC. ZuperDAC also works with Raspberry Pi 2 with Volumio Audiophile Music Player Distribution.



Cable and adapter not included.


Special Edition - RED


For the passionate ones, why not get the ZuperDAC in color red? It is a special edition that we created for this campaign. Use it to energize you with music and be different.

You can add the extra $5 or $10 shipping as a contribution when you select the perk check out. In case you forgot to put in the shipping contribution, you can select the above $5 or $10 shipping perk and enter with the same email address as your original perk contribution.* Free shipping to US and China only applies during the Indiegogo campaign period. Starting with the InDemand, the shipping fee is being adjusted.The Birth of ZuperDACComputer and smartphone excel at computation, storage and connectivity. However, due to different design constraints like space, interference and cost, it is hard to build a good computer or smartphone audio system. 
USB-DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) is an elegant solution to solve this problem. By streaming raw digital audio data through USB to the USB-DAC, it bypass the internal audio system and reconstruct HiFi music externally. 
When we look at existing USB-DAC products, they are mostly bulky and expensive. We therefore decided to build one.ZuperDAC is a truly portable USB-DAC at only 11 cm3 and 16 gram. It is based on ESS ES9018K2M HiFi grade AudioDAC and supports USB Audio Class 2 192kHz 24-bit resolution. It supports Windows 7/8, OS X Yosemite, Ubuntu, iOS and Android*. That means you can use it anytime and anywhere.
We would like to build HiFi audio product affordable by all music lovers. We hope that you can support our vision. ZuperDAC is now offered as a reward for the early bird adopter at $49. This is a truly portable HiFi USB-DAC that you can contribute to make it real.Technical Specification*Android Compatibility List
Due to segmentation of Android and the hardware design, we cannot guarantee the compatibility of ZuperDAC with every Android phone. We have tested ZuperDAC to work with the following phones:

Samsung Galaxy S3/S4/S5/S6/S6 Edge
Samsung Note 2/3/4/Edge
LG G2 Pro/G3/G4
Google Nexus 5/6
Sony Xperia Z1/Z2/Z3
Some phones like HTC M7/M8 and Oneplus One will disable volume control at USB audio operation (Volume key can only turn on or off USB audio output). If you use it with a headphone, there is no way to control output volume level (which is set at the maximum level and may be harmful to your ears). If you connect to an external powered speaker or amplifier with volume control, it should work well.Frequently Asked Questions

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes, we live in a dangerous, crazy world, and as much as we would like to drown it all out, we know that is not always the safest thing to do. Whether you are driving your car through traffic or walking down the sidewalk, it is essential that you are aware of what is going on around you. Believe it or not, the number of people who have suffered injury or death while wearing headphones has nearly tripled in the last six years. Why? This is because other earphones block out too much external noise. Wearers are unable to hear approaching traffic, warning shouts, car horns, or even an approaching train, causing them to have been badly hurt or even killed. Many lives could have been saved if the victim had heard the warnings. With Harsaa you can enjoy your tunes and still be safe. Simply tap your earpiece once and you can safely listen to your music and still hear traffic, car horns, or other warning signals.</p>

<p><b>What kind of
batteries does the H2P use?</b></p>
<p>The H2P uses size 10 Zinc Air batteries – one for each ear.
Please see our “Extra Batteries” perk if wanting to purchase extra batteries.</p>
<p><b>How long do the
batteries last?</b><br/>
The batteries last up to 140 hours.</p>
<p><b>Does the H2P have an
on/off switch?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Turning the volume dial clockwise turns the volume up;
turning it counter-clockwise turns it down. Once turned all the way down, you
feel the sticking point that turns it off.</p>
<p><b>When will the
shipping process begin? </b></p>
<p>We will be shipping orders chronologically at the end of
November.</p>
<p><b>Can the H2P be used
as a hearing aid?</b></p>
<p>The H2P can enhance hearing up to 6x the normal hearing

<p>The Decibullz earpieces are unique in audio. These proprietary custom molds soften in hot water and lose temperature rapidly while maintaining their moldable properties. This allows the earpieces to be shaped comfortably to the ear. Once cooled the earpieces retain their shape until re-heated. Decibullz earpieces are the only earpieces that can be re-heated and re-shaped as many times as desired. </p>

<p>These earphones are built to last. And they sound awesome! Each earphone is carefully machined out of a solid block of aluminum. The new premium cables and components are stronger than ever. Having a connecting wire allows for longer battery life, combined charging and around-the-neck wearability. It also acts as a lanyard so earphones don't get lost or separated. We have selected a larger driver that is powerful without compromising sound quality.</p>

</div>","Finally, custom molded wireless earphones! DECIBULLZ WIRELESS are easily and quickly shaped by the user to their unique ears. This is the future of earphones: anatomically inspired wearable tech!


  
  
  
 
Decibullz Wireless Earphones just received a 2016 Consumer Electronics Innovation Award and our wired earphones were selected by USA Today's Reviewed.com as the BEST EARPHONES OF 2015!  

  
  
  

The FIRST custom molded wireless earphones!
Easily shaped in minutes.
$89 Indiegogo price.
Small and light. 
Award winning design. 
Unique custom-fit earpieces keep Decibullz Wireless secure and comfortable while providing superior noise isolation.
New Easy Fit system makes shaping and re-shaping simple and fast. Heat the earpieces in hot water and shape them to your ears. That's it!
The latest Bluetooth® technology for top audio quality and performance.
Perfect for music, video, and voice calls.
7 great color options for extra customizations.
Fully compatible with most smartphones, tablets and computers.

Decibullz Wireless earphones combine easily formed custom-molded earpieces with the latest in wireless audio technology.

  
 


The Decibullz earpieces are unique in audio. These proprietary custom molds soften in hot water and lose temperature rapidly while maintaining their moldable properties. This allows the earpieces to be shaped comfortably to the ear. Once cooled the earpieces retain their shape until re-heated. Decibullz earpieces are the only earpieces that can be re-heated and re-shaped as many times as desired. 


  
 
Combining innovative Decibullz earpieces with state-of-the-art wireless technology gives Decibullz Wireless 'wired' audio quality. The all-new sound engine is specially tuned for use with the custom molds. These new earphones have a powerful, clear and balanced sound.


  
  
  
 

We believe in listening to what you love while doing what you love. We were tired of poor-fitting, uncomfortable earphones so we created an earphone that will stay in and stay comfortable no matter what you are doing. Decibullz Wireless are perfect for any activity from extreme sports to just relaxing to your favorite playlist.


  
  
  
 
The new Easy Fit system makes it even easier to shape and re-shape the custom earpieces. Simply heat the Decibullz mold and silicone tip in hot water, snap on the Decibullz earphone and shape them to your ears. If for any reason you're not happy with your fit just remove, re-heat and re-shape. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes!

  
 

  


Decibullz Wireless earphones feature the most advanced sound engine we have ever created. We worked with top audio specialists to create custom 9mm drivers. We then tuned the new drivers for use with our custom earpieces. The result is a powerful, clean and balanced sound. 

  
 
  


The Decibullz earpieces provide superior noise isolation. Our double seal system can provide up to 40 decibels of protection across the frequency range. Headphones in, world out.

  
 
  


These earphones are built to last. And they sound awesome! Each earphone is carefully machined out of a solid block of aluminum. The new premium cables and components are stronger than ever. Having a connecting wire allows for longer battery life, combined charging and around-the-neck wearability. It also acts as a lanyard so earphones don't get lost or separated. We have selected a larger driver that is powerful without compromising sound quality.


 

  


Customize your Decibullz Wireless even further with your choice of 7 great colors.

  
 

  


Take control of your smartphone with the Decibullz Wireless control unit. Decibullz Wireless are compatible with most smartphones, tablets and computers that support Bluetooth® audio streaming.

In 2014 with the help of  backers we were able to create the first DIY custom molded earphones. This first-generation earphone won a CES Innovation and Engineering Award, USA Today's Reviewed.com Editors Choice Award, and USA Today's Reviewed.com Best Earphone of 2015 Award!

  
 
We learned so much while creating this first-generation product. We have applied everything we learned to create this next generation of earphones. These products are higher quality, better sounding and more durable than the previous generation.


  


In 2014 we were able to produce the world's first heat-molded earphones! The crowdfunding community was so instrumental in helping us get off the ground that we couldn't imagine building our next product without them.

Sliders, lightstrips (with rec/loop capabilities), lightplanes/thumbpads with z-axis sensitivity and a row of pressure sensitive buttons. Behind those state of the art touch controllers lies a high-speed microcontroller that joins the elements to create keyboards, sequencers, arpeggiators and, finally, your perfect performance setup. The following video sows just the basics in controlling modular synth, drums and entire voices:</p><div>

</div>
<p>Soundmachines know-how in capacitive touch control surface is unparalleled in eurorack. With thousands of LS1lightstrips and LP1lightplanes in the market, is the name to consider when talking about reliable, simple and flawless touch CV generators/recorders. Following customer’s requests and nurturing interest for integrated, easy to use and alternative control interfaces, we came up with a series of ideas that adapted our robust technology to earlier concepts developed by the fathers of the modular synthesizers. The key target was the design and implementation of a carefully conceived product with the maximum attention to usability, highest possible degree of functionalities and an affordable pricing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>(arches) is a powerful user interface capable of interacting with many instruments and systems thanks to its 30+ CV/GATE outputs and full MIDI connectivity (DIN, USB and wireless MIDI over BLE):</p>
<p><strong>Pressure sensitive buttons</strong>: Each of those buttons can be configured to ourput  GATE and CV signals or to be a part of an 8 buttons keyboard. Each buttons will output a pitch information and an overall 'pressure' information will be available to a separate CV out or midi #CC.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530804834/dqbswx6ps4tsdn4cvhvn.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Sliders and Lightstrips</strong>: 12 slider-type elements can be configured either as indiviual elements (with configurable range, midi channel, quantization and CV standard) or grouped together in one of the many keyboard configurations (see below). You can assign each element to a couple of I/O jacks (CV and GATE)</div>

<strong>Thumbpads/Lightplanes</strong>: Just under your thumbs lies a couple of sensitive three-dimensional surfaces (X-Y-Z) that are available as standard outputs all the time. They can also optionally generate gate information.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>
<p><strong>Virtual Keyboards</strong>:</p>
<p>(arches) can create up to three concurrent independent keyboards, each one with its own set of outputs and its own arpeggiator. For each of the keyboards you can define the standard (eurorack, buchla, v/hz), the note associated with every ‘element’ and the MIDI channel. With this powerful modularity you can control up to three voices for melodic and rhythmic stuff, having the free lightplanes as a mean of modulating other parameters of your setup/patch. On top of this you have the layered functionalities that can run in parallel (one 8 step sequencer and one 8step, 5 track drum sequencer).</p>

<h3>Concept and prototypes:</h3>
<div> </div>
<div>The concept of (arches)  evolved during time and crystallized in the final design after moving through several phases. We  started with a rough sketch that served the purpose to understand better what can and cannot be improved with a control device like this:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530805616/bnxajxe1mkzxr4wojcvh.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And then some more visually enhanced designs came to the surface:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530805730/fd5x73h2eowpzkis5iwz.png"" src=""""/></div>

</div></div>","IntroBlending inspiration, power and ease of use, we created the perfect evolution of the concept of tactile controller. Built on the foundation of our first class touch interfaces (LS1lightstrip and LP1lightplane), found today on thousands of eurorack systems around the world, we designed a beautiful work of art and technology.(arches) put a never seen before set of controllers at your fingertips. Sliders, lightstrips (with rec/loop capabilities), lightplanes/thumbpads with z-axis sensitivity and a row of pressure sensitive buttons. Behind those state of the art touch controllers lies a high-speed microcontroller that joins the elements to create keyboards, sequencers, arpeggiators and, finally, your perfect performance setup. The following video sows just the basics in controlling modular synth, drums and entire voices:



 

Soundmachines know-how in capacitive touch control surface is unparalleled in eurorack. With thousands of LS1lightstrips and LP1lightplanes in the market, is the name to consider when talking about reliable, simple and flawless touch CV generators/recorders. Following customer’s requests and nurturing interest for integrated, easy to use and alternative control interfaces, we came up with a series of ideas that adapted our robust technology to earlier concepts developed by the fathers of the modular synthesizers. The key target was the design and implementation of a carefully conceived product with the maximum attention to usability, highest possible degree of functionalities and an affordable pricing.
 
Functions
(arches) is a powerful user interface capable of interacting with many instruments and systems thanks to its 30+ CV/GATE outputs and full MIDI connectivity (DIN, USB and wireless MIDI over BLE):
Pressure sensitive buttons: Each of those buttons can be configured to ourput  GATE and CV signals or to be a part of an 8 buttons keyboard. Each buttons will output a pitch information and an overall 'pressure' information will be available to a separate CV out or midi #CC.



Sliders and Lightstrips: 12 slider-type elements can be configured either as indiviual elements (with configurable range, midi channel, quantization and CV standard) or grouped together in one of the many keyboard configurations (see below). You can assign each element to a couple of I/O jacks (CV and GATE)

 

 

Thumbpads/Lightplanes: Just under your thumbs lies a couple of sensitive three-dimensional surfaces (X-Y-Z) that are available as standard outputs all the time. They can also optionally generate gate information.

 

Virtual Keyboards:
(arches) can create up to three concurrent independent keyboards, each one with its own set of outputs and its own arpeggiator. For each of the keyboards you can define the standard (eurorack, buchla, v/hz), the note associated with every ‘element’ and the MIDI channel. With this powerful modularity you can control up to three voices for melodic and rhythmic stuff, having the free lightplanes as a mean of modulating other parameters of your setup/patch. On top of this you have the layered functionalities that can run in parallel (one 8 step sequencer and one 8step, 5 track drum sequencer).
monophonic full keyboard: 12 elements:


 
8 pressure sensitive buttons keyboard:

 
 left hand, six elements keyboard:

 
right hand, six elements keyboard:

 
central 8 elements keyboard:

 
12 keys polyphonic (three voices + expression) keybard:

 
 
Concept and prototypes:
 
The concept of (arches)  evolved during time and crystallized in the final design after moving through several phases. We  started with a rough sketch that served the purpose to understand better what can and cannot be improved with a control device like this:
 

 
 
And then some more visually enhanced designs came to the surface:
 

 
and:

 
We then decided the (arches) to be a single stand-alone unit, and so we included the configuration interface and the jack bay on the right part of the product, freezing the final design:

 
The first printed circuit board was designed and this is the picture of the result:

 
A few prototype (arches) were manufactured to start the firmware development and  the limited function (arches) was finally presented at the Berlin Superbooth in May!

MusicLens’ custom-designed bone conduction speakers rest outside the ear and send audio signals through the skin and bone via vibrations. This means you experience your music in striking clarity while still being able to hear the world around you. Keeping your ear canals empty and your senses sharp is a safer, healthier, and more comfortable way to listen to music.                                           
  MusicLens’ location of the speaker is the best place of bone conduction transmission, and MusicLens is the only brand in the market who build speaker in this place with our unique patent. The sound quality of this spot will be four times better than any other place.  MusicLens are the only smart glasses with bone conduction audio that features enhanced bass. Experience truly dynamic sound whether you’re into hip hop, jazz, or pop with booming bass that gives you a front row seat to all your favorite bands.Another benefit of MusicLens’ bone conduction speakers is that they are imperceptible to anyone around you. No one will know you’re listening to music even if you have the volume turned up to the max. This is because MusicLens speakers work by sending vibrations into your skin, not by blasting your eardrums with the sound that can easily disturb coworkers, passengers on public transport, or a partner who’s trying to sleep.  Another benefit of MusicLens’ bone conduction speakers is that they are imperceptible to anyone around you.

This allows you to store thousands of songs directly into the glasses. No WiFi issues, connection failures, or drained batteries will keep you from the music you love. You can purchase the “4GB Storage Perk” separately to upgrade your MusicLens!An industry first, MusicLens features a state-of-the-art battery that lasts up to 80% longer than that of other smart glasses.

Wear them to the gym, the beach, or in almost any kind of weather. MusicLens are built to accompany you anywhere and everywhere, and with their life-proof design, you’ll never have to think about taking them off.Hold the “Switch” button for 5 seconds to activate Al voice assistants on your phone, such as Siri, Alexa, Bixby, Google Assistant, etc.Micro-sensors are built into Musiclens‘s frame,allowing you to control all of its functions with a tap or a slide of the finger. Adjust the volume,answer calls,or play and pause your music with button-free simplicity. MusicLens recognizes when you’re wearing them and when you’re not, so you don’t have to worry about pressing the “Pause” button every time you take them off. The second you remove them, MusicLens will automatically stop playing music, saving your battery life and giving you one less thing to do.

We found that each had at least one major problem or a set of features missing. Many are only made out of rubber and plastic and therefore break easily, or only offer one way to connect. Most importantly, better headphones cost over $200 a pair and often still lack seemingly basic features such as a play/pause button. We couldn’t find a single pair with all the features we considered important at an affordable price.</p><p>With this in mind, we set out on a mission to create a pair of headphones with the best features at an affordable price. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we tried over 50 headphones and 100 components made by a diverse set of manufacturers. Each had some admirable features but not one of them got it right.  We treated the best features as modular options, and combined them piece by piece, while leveraging the scale of operations from all these different manufacturers.  This was how the Modular brand and Mod-1 Headphones were born.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515793790/zybn9fwkl3gigpo24qcf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515793989/mrws5jguqxbzvvvej98v.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Mod-1 Headphones are packed with a wide array of features that work together to provide you with a uniquely immersive sound experience. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Left/Right Indicator</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ffls1/mod/7.gif"" src=""""/></p><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

Music has been found to improve your mood by reducing stress and anxiety, improves your creativity and motivation, and can even decrease pain and improve your physical health. We use headphones to fill our day with music, this helps make every day a little better. We wear them non-stop while traveling, exercising and working, so it is very important that headphones have all the features we need: optimal comfort, a long-lasting battery life, great sound quality, strong bluetooth compatibility, and durability at an affordable price.  Headphones have been around for quite some time, which is why we were shocked by the features and quality of the consumer headphones on the market. We found that each had at least one major problem or a set of features missing. Many are only made out of rubber and plastic and therefore break easily, or only offer one way to connect. Most importantly, better headphones cost over $200 a pair and often still lack seemingly basic features such as a play/pause button. We couldn’t find a single pair with all the features we considered important at an affordable price.With this in mind, we set out on a mission to create a pair of headphones with the best features at an affordable price. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we tried over 50 headphones and 100 components made by a diverse set of manufacturers. Each had some admirable features but not one of them got it right.  We treated the best features as modular options, and combined them piece by piece, while leveraging the scale of operations from all these different manufacturers.  This was how the Modular brand and Mod-1 Headphones were born. Mod-1 Headphones are packed with a wide array of features that work together to provide you with a uniquely immersive sound experience.  Left/Right Indicator 
Low-Intensity Indicator Light

 Noise Isolation Listen 3 Different Ways 40mm Drivers = Rich Sound Profile Modular - Easily Replace Ear Pads Play, Pause, Skip, and Volume Buttons Durable, All-Metal Band Remote Call Notification Works With Samsung Dual-Audio Overall the Mod-1 boasts better bass and comfort than every other pair of headphones we tried, even when the volume isn’t turned up. Mod-1 has noise cancellation through isolation - meaning once music is playing, the shape of the ear cups isolate incoming sound to just the music. To keep the product lightweight, the battery life of Mod-1 is typically 8 hours, however they can be used indefinitely while connected with the auxiliary cable. With the ability to keep using them while they are charging, you can easily wear them 24/7.Less than half of the headphones we tried had these features we added to the Mod-1:
L/R headphone indicator printed on earpads
Real announcer voice for informative alerts
Skip/Play/Pause buttons
Aux AND Bluetooth
NFC chip fast connection
Folding design
None of the headphones we tried had an SD card slot.In short, you'd have to buy many headphones to get the same features you'll find in the Mod-1.   Check out what everyone has been saying about these amazing headphones! We made a few hundred pairs with our manufacturer as a sample run. Now, we need to commit to a larger order volume to make more. We'd love to have your support, and you'll get a great deal if you hurry!     Thank you for your support, we are proud to welcome you to the Modular community! Hope you will enjoy your brand new headphones and the uniquely immersive sound experience they provide.

It's your smart assistant with comfortable and secure all-day wearing.What Reviewers Are Saying About HS-3  


 


 
 Origem HS-3 on CES   Typical earbuds with Siri or Google Assistant integration require a double tap to activate. But sometimes, your hands are busy or your situation makes that motion hard to do. That’s why we designed a built-in voice recognition system in Origem HS-3 that helps you to easily activate and control your phone assistant with just a few words… HS-3 Voice Control Demo by @Just Doin' Life   


 

 
 



 

 

 
  


 

 
The beauty of sound is the result of vibrations from a multitude of frequencies. Some people enjoy listening to loud music, while others may prefer songs played at low volumes. So, audio engineers are tasked with creating hardware that can deliver accurate sound at a range of volumes. In this case, traditional earbuds fail to optimize the audio from different frequency ranges to achieve perfect audio fidelity.  HDR (“High Dynamic Range”) audio is a technique which draws its inspiration from HDR imaging, which attempts to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity , In HDR audio contrast refers to loudness instead of brightness.Origem HS-3 deploys the HDR Algorithm which automatically maps, culls, mixes and optimizes sound across all frequency levels to create a more accurate, expansive and enjoyable listening experience at any volume.HDR algorithm achieves dynamic optimization of audio resolutionThe HDR algorithm detects the sound pressure of the listening environment and volume of the sound to dynamically adjust for all different frequency levels based on ISO226 Equal Loudness. All of this means that Origem HS-3 delivers detailed highs, crystal clear mids, and powerful bass, like a perfect combination of subwoofer, mid-range and high-frequency speaker. After 10 months of testing and hundreds of audio refinements, a more accurate perceived loudness is delivered from the combination of HDR audio algorithm and Origem HS-3’s 10mm graphene speaker, increasing the standard acoustic field by 25%. Enjoy an ultimate audio experience like never before. Enhanced Sound powered by high fidelity audio technologyHS-3 features a customized driver made with graphene. Due to its low mass density, the driver is able to produce excellent frequency response across the whole audible region. Not only that but also it delivers louder sound with no distortion. In addition, HS-3 is equipped with aptX technology which reliably improves sound transmission quality via Bluetooth. So the sound doesn’t suffer or degrade from wireless transmission. It’s so annoying when earbuds fall out from time to time when we exercise or play sports. Origem HS-3’s +-70-degree rotatable earhooks allow you to find the perfect fit for your own unique ear shape. You never have to worry about your earbuds escaping from your ears no matter what activity you’re doing.The Origem earhooks are constructed using a base layer of stainless wire-steel that can be infinitely adjusted over and over. On top, a high quality, skin-friendly PVD coating covers the earhooks for all-day, every day, comfort.After thousands of hours of testing on differently shaped ear canals, the Origem HS-3s have been fine-tuned with an ear tip angle of 120 degrees to provide a more comfortable wear, secure fit and better audio delivery. 4 sets of ear canal tips are made using high quality silicone that ergonomically seals seamlessly in every ear. Select the best ear tips for your ears and immersive yourself in a better audio experience.  How long does it take to fully charge up your current earbuds? 1 hour or more? Wireless earbuds are only as good as the power they have at the ready. Origem makes charging a breeze with an on-board 3.7V rechargeable lithium polymer battery specially designed for fast charging. Origem HS-3 can be fully charged and ready to rock in only 30 minutes. We know that having the right tunes makes any workout better, but not all earbuds are up to the challenge. Origem HS-3 meet the IPX5 waterproof standard and are perfect for a run in the weather or a trip to the gym. HS-3 is your best new, reliable, workout companion. Run wild and enjoy your outdoor workout with awesome audio. Origem HS-3 features Bluetooth 5.0 that transmits sound with low latency, connects automatically, and uses low power.

<p>Take crisp, deep, room-filling HiFi sound with you anywhere on the go with Buoy. This is a multi-dimensional waterproof speaker that comes with so many amazing features. Once fully charged, this speaker is capable of delivering sound for up to 24 hours at a stretch. </p>
<p>Buoy produces multi-dimensional, precise sound by replicating the techniques used on $1,000+ audio systems that control distortion of the music through hardware instead of software. This is exactly the opposite of the typically muffled and tiny tones most smartphone speakers emit. </p>
<p>The fact that it is waterproof and portable makes this speaker a perfect must have for your beach parties. Buoy can play your favorite tunes as an MP3 from a micro SD card and there is never a need for an SD card reader so you can always leave your phone behind but never leaving your music behind.</p>

<p>Often times backers are concerned when and if they would ever get their products that they pledged for but we can assure you that we have taken the time to develop this right. This is our Second project and second campaign on Indiegogo. </p>
<p>While we have acquired the cabinet mould for BigBuoy, which was designed by others and pretty much controls the exterior look of the speaker, the rest has all been redone including the cabinet material functionalities, electronics, software, PCB, Battery, certification, software, etc. Our speaker is APTX, FCC Certified, IPX 7 and comes with a Leather Strap, Auto shutoff, Charging capabilities while off, etc. In summary while the use of the mould is to save thousands of dollars, the rest &amp; certification that meets certain strict criteria is all different. We then replicated our technology in a smaller Buoy creating a twin. </p>
<p>Using an existing mould on certain fabricated items can cut cost by $40,000 or more and allows new products to be manufactured and offered at higher quality by allocating funds to features and quality components and technology vs structural fabrication. </p>

“Amazing. Incredible. It’s so crisp. I want it! A big sound in a little box.” My Mac

“ Nothing sounds better than BUOY in this price class. The soul shaking bass and room filling sound is simply nothing short of amazing. This Buoy is Loud! If you are in the market for a wireless speaker that delivers across the board, the Buoy is for you.”  Dragon Blogger 
Take crisp, deep, room-filling HiFi sound with you anywhere on the go with Buoy. This is a multi-dimensional waterproof speaker that comes with so many amazing features. Once fully charged, this speaker is capable of delivering sound for up to 24 hours at a stretch. 
Buoy produces multi-dimensional, precise sound by replicating the techniques used on $1,000+ audio systems that control distortion of the music through hardware instead of software. This is exactly the opposite of the typically muffled and tiny tones most smartphone speakers emit. 
The fact that it is waterproof and portable makes this speaker a perfect must have for your beach parties. Buoy can play your favorite tunes as an MP3 from a micro SD card and there is never a need for an SD card reader so you can always leave your phone behind but never leaving your music behind.
Please see the Waterproof test:


Please see Buoy Float and play under water: Soul Shaking Bass

Please see the Sound/Loudness Test: These Buoys are Very Loud!




Buoy produces multi-dimensional, precise sound by replicating the techniques used on $1,000+ audio systems that control distortion of the music through hardware instead of software. – exactly the opposite of the typically muffled and tiny tones most smartphone speakers emit. Don’t let the size fool you.






This small, timeless speaker will pump up the volume without distorting the sound quality. It’s less than two inches deep but packs a massive musical punch, connecting via Bluetooth, Auxiliary Audio Cable or from a Micro SD card.On a full charge, it’ll play for 24 hours anywhere you take it. 





But like your smartphone, Buoy travels well: in the park, on the road, the beach, the pool even the shower – the Buoy goes where you do. And if you want to leave your smartphone behind, Buoy can play your favourite tunes as an MP3 from a micro SD card and there is never a need for an SD card reader. Manage media
on micro SD card when speaker is powered OFF and connected to your computer via
Micro USB cable. Buoy will play from all files and folders on the SD card in an alphabetical order.
Often times backers are concerned when and if they would ever get their products that they pledged for but we can assure you that we have taken the time to develop this right. This is our Second project and second campaign on Indiegogo. 
While we have acquired the cabinet mould for BigBuoy, which was designed by others and pretty much controls the exterior look of the speaker, the rest has all been redone including the cabinet material functionalities, electronics, software, PCB, Battery, certification, software, etc. Our speaker is APTX, FCC Certified, IPX 7 and comes with a Leather Strap, Auto shutoff, Charging capabilities while off, etc. In summary while the use of the mould is to save thousands of dollars, the rest & certification that meets certain strict criteria is all different. We then replicated our technology in a smaller Buoy creating a twin. 
Using an existing mould on certain fabricated items can cut cost by $40,000 or more and allows new products to be manufactured and offered at higher quality by allocating funds to features and quality components and technology vs structural fabrication. 





Portable • Compact • Loud
Using two (2) 45mm-7Watt Drivers and a stiff passive radiator for extra deep bass, Buoy produces stunning cinematic sound, with smooth highs, crystal clear mid-range and bone-shaking bass and is equipped with a long lasting rechargeable lithium ion battery that when fully charged, will give you an amazing 24 hours of playtime.

Nothing sounds as good as these two bad buoys!
Raise the standard of sound quality and keep the tunes pumping rain or shine with Buoy. Compatible with any and every Bluetooth enabled device, this speaker is loaded with technology to provide true 360-degree sound. 
Powerful True Audio Stereo Speaker with amazing detail and outstanding bass! You are going to love Buoy and we guarantee it!
Buoy uses two 40mm full range drivers for an incredible output coupled with a passive subwoofer to maximise the base response. This allowed us to pump out incredible 360º sound in true stereo for precise multi-dimensional sound reproduction all in a beautiful package that fits in your hand and budget.

The most memorable beachside gatherings and camping trips are the ones where the music never stops.  With IPX 7, Buoy rugged exterior defends against water, sand and drops. It has the ability to float in water so don't be afraid to take it to the water just be sure the interface door is sealed.

Up to 24 hours of continuous play on a single charge
Buoy is the only portable Bluetooth speaker we know that is truly waterproof, sand proof and shock proof that delivers crisp, deep room-filling sound and is equipped with a long lasting rechargeable lithium ion battery that when fully charged, will give you an amazing 24 hours of playtime.
Raise the standard of sound quality and keep the tunes pumping rain or shine with Buoy. Compatible with any and every Bluetooth enabled device, this speaker is loaded with technology to provide true 360-degree sound. Inside the Buoy Speaker are two full range high quality drivers with neodymium magnets and a passive subwoofer to produce powerful bass and natural audio to fill the room. Buoy produces deep base at a remarkable volume.
As it’s wireless, you can bring this crisp and pristine sound wherever you want. The iconic Buoy shape is sleek and bold yet inconspicuous, enhancing any environment. Its modern look is only outdone with the its amazing sound.

Buoy offers convenience, portability, Big Volume and outstanding bass with no distortion in a compact, grab and go convenience and all neatly in this beautiful package that fits in your hand and budget.


Buoy is not just about flexibility; it was built to deliver superior sound. Two speaker drivers and a passive radiator come together to deliver a new dimension to your audio and music.
Regular portable speakers have average sound power, but poor bass, and regular home speaker systems have good sound power, but are not portable.
Most speakers also tend to have big, obtrusive, in-your-face logos and branding. It is like you paid them then they advertise on your purchase. Enough, we said and so Buoy and Big Buoy will show the brand and certification on the bottom of the speaker and not anywhere else where it distracts from the speaker great looks.

Mixing water and electronics usually doesn't end well. Until Now. Buoy is the perfect device to accompany you on all of your travels and adventures. Best of all, the speaker is rugged and waterproof so it can withstand whatever you throw its way. 



Buoy is fully waterproof (iPX7 -- immersion up to 1 m for 30 minutes), as well as drop-resistant to five feet or 1.5 meters.

Pump the tunes no matter where you are with the Buoy Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker.

Don’t let water stand in the way of great tunes.

 sporting a high SNR of 120dB and is well regarded for its  impressive 
low noise and low distortion characteristics. in short, this means that 
the sound you hear is crystal clear, rich and retains a wonderfully full
 dynamic range.bluMe applies the latest in Bluetooth technology, the 
Bluetooth 4.1 to stream any format of music from your smart device, 
laptop or PC.Most devices use the basic SBC Bluetooth music 
codec. While this may be okay for some, but if you want great quality, 
it's simply not good enough.
bluMe uses Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) and aptX®, a superior 
performance digital audio codec.  This combination of advanced hardware 
and firmware preserves all the musical detail, dynamic range and full 
bandwidth response, bringing out the best possible sound from your 
digital sources, for a sound that is far superior to standard Bluetooth 
streamed music.The delay between your TV and speakers is a common problem within many wireless audio solutions.  With bluMe, enjoy great movies knowing that picture and sound will always sync perfectly.bluMe features the latest aptX® Low Latency technology that 
reduces this latency down to less than 40 ms, eliminating lip-sync 
issues to give you the smoothest audio/visual experience available.Limited range and signal dropouts have traditionally plagued Bluetooth audio systems.To combat this issue, bluMe employs special circuitry and a 
precision-tuned external high gain antenna to extend the wireless range,
 ensuring consistent, stable, strong, and glitch-free performance for 30
 meters (100 feet), providing much more versatility than other Bluetooth
 receivers.bluMe's cutting edge technology maintains a robust and balanced 
wireless sound experience that is unaffected by interference from 
surrounding wireless networks. This results in superior 24-bit, upsampled audio that will completely redefine your perception of wireless sound.bluMe has two high quality gold-plated RCA jacks that operate as 
analog outputs. Any audio system with a standard analog audio input can 
connect to bluMe with the supplied RCA-RCA signal cable.For systems that have 3.5mm “mini” jack input, use the supplied RCA-mini cable.bluMe
 also features a Digital Optical (SPIDF) Out so that you can connect to 
an outboard DAC or the digital input of a surround receiver, 
giving you a 100% pure high-res digital signal through to your sound 
system.
Pairing any smart device to bluMe is a breeze. Simply push the 
control button on the front of the unit briefly and it automatically 
goes into pairing mode. Activate Bluetooth in your smart device, select 
""auris bluMe"" from the list of available devices and you’re ready to rock!bluMe can connect to one smart device at a time, but is capable of remembering up to 8 devices.  When more than one device needs
 to stream through bluMe, just turn Bluetooth off in the first device, turn Bluetooth on in the second, and select ""auris bluMe"" as the device.  There is no need to reset bluMe and press its control button a second time once the device is stored.  Even powering bluMe
 is easy.  Draw power from a wall socket, or from the included USB 
cable, which means you can power it directly from your PC, Laptop, and 
more recent TVs and sound systems.Result of an elaborate manufacturing process, the chassis is extruded 
out of aerospace grade aluminum and high quality anodizing provides 
optimum protection and finish. bluMe is a premium product in every sense which  completely 
blends  while sitting next to even the costliest and most attractive 
home audio components.Vast majority of us tend to hard wire our smart devices to an audio 
system by either
using a dock that pulls analog out of the device or by hooking up to the
 headphone output jack. In both cases the digital signal is processed by
 cheap low fidelity DAC used in all smart devices. With bluMe the digital signal is processed by its high-end DAC and audio decoders. No wonder bluMe sounds better than wired hookups!

bluMe can play any audio source a Bluetooth enabled device can 
access, opening up a virtually unlimited universe of music to enjoy 
through your Hi-Fi audio system.So you’re always in control not just of the music that’s stored on your 
device but also access music streaming services such as Pandora and 
Spotify, internet radio stations, podcasts and even music libraries 
connected to a wireless home network...all instantly, wirelessly in 
Hi-Fi quality.With a choice of either Black, Gold or Silver you’re sure to find a bluMe that matches your stereo system.bluMe ships with a specially designed drawstring microfiber bag. You can now put bluMe
 in it's little microfiber bag, stick it in your coat pocket and take it
 with you anywhere there is power, a stereo amp or powered speakers and a
 Bluetooth device to provide the music.
Made out of high quality microfiber, this pouch will protect bluMe from dust, scratches and is the perfect fabric for eliminating pesky fingerprints.

Created by doctors, each pair of SoundMolds are made specifically to fit the exact shape of your ear. With earbuds that fit, you’ll finally have a pair that won't fall out.SoundMolds are powered by our partners at NuForce (named top ten ear bud by consumer reports!) to deliver crisp, clear, sound, so you can enjoy top of the line earbuds without the custom price. And to top it off, they are available in both wired and wireless versions. 

SoundMolds are innovative, custom-made earbuds that merge comfort, clarity, and longevity to create a product you’ll wish you met years ago.Whether you choose the wired or wireless option, you’ll get a complete set of flexible, hypoallergenic, silicone earbuds that are specially tailored for your ears. So instead of the old “square peg in a round hole” route most earbuds go, with SoundMolds it’s more like placing a puzzle piece to its perfect fit.Using a pair of earbuds that actually fit your ear has the added luxury of blocking unnecessary background noise.   Much like your eye doctor has to take measurements to create a custom prescription for glasses, we need to do something similar for your ear.When you order your SoundMolds, we'll ship you your EarPrint Impression Kit straight to your door, you'll take 8 minutes to create an impression using the kit, and mail it back! It’s that easy!And in about 2 weeks after we receive your EarPrint impressions, you’ll have your snug-as-a-bug earbuds. And trust me - they’re worth the minimal wait. Once you spoil your ears with these snuggly ear wonders, you won’t be able to live without them!And yes - shipping is prepaid so you don't need to worry about that!   It isn’t hard to understand why run-of-the-mill earbuds fall out. They’re usually slippery, very generically shaped, and have no real grip. So if you start to work up a sweat or move too much, it’s enough to cause them to bail from your ears. With SoundMolds, a custom fit means that they’re staying put no matter how sweaty you are or how extreme your movements. These earbuds will stay put. * Always ensure that you are safe when wearing earbuds. The SoundMolds noise-reduction feature is adjustable so that you can still hear what's around you!

 
 
 

 
 In line with the generic shape and rigid plastic, most earbuds are painfully inflexible and definitely don’t take your individual ear shape into account. This crummy design means there’s bound to be aching pressure points and discomfort. Poor fit means that when you take them out, it’s like changing from your tight, starched pants after Thanksgiving dinner into super-soft oversized sweats. Removing your earbuds shouldn’t bring such relief, and no ears deserve that tight-pants fit.The customized shape of your SoundMolds earbuds will be so welcome and cuddly to your ears that they might cry a little when you remove them, so don’t be alarmed. (Ears have feelings, too.)  The fact of the matter is, no matter HOW great your acoustics are, if you don’t have a perfect seal between the ear and the outside environment, your sound experience will suffer.  Background noise can not only distort your listening experience, it can actually end up seriously damaging your ear health. When we feel the need to up the volume to drown out the background noise, we’re often unaware of the dangerous decibel levels we’re inflicting on our poor ears.But if you have a fit so precise that it creates a secure seal that gently hugs every curve of your ear while thoroughly eliminating background noise, you can happily listen to your audio at lower levels without needing to punish your ears with high volume. SoundMolds are more than a custom solution Just imagine how much better you’ll be able to focus and concentrate without the distraction of your earbuds diving from your ears or incessant background noise...That annoying meathead shout-grunting with every lift at the gym? Silence him with quiet workout tunes.The screaming toddler on the airplane? You can’t hear a thing as you listen to your podcast.Your snoring partner who’s giving the plane a run for its money? Quiet as a lamb while you drift off to ambient sleep sounds…And all thanks to the perfect seal created by your cushy, hypoallergenic earbuds. Available in Wired and Wireless Versions  HEM Wired Earbud:

Acoustically calculated and vibration free Lexan™ earpiece for comfortable and fatigue free fit.

  See his first impression wearing SoundMolds Testimonials""Amy, the earbuds are AMAZING. You and your office team were wonderful. I'm so grateful to be able to have the ear bud. They fit comfortably and I don't hear much. "" -Elaine Rosenthal​""Wearing headphones is a pretty big part of my life. In the gym, traveling, or working, I spend a significant amount of time with headphones in. SoundMolds sound great, don't fall out, and fit perfectly in my ears. I believe you should invest in things you enjoy and spend a lot of time with. For me, SoundMolds is my investment in the music I enjoy every day.""  - [real estate dev.]“If you have standards or care about yourself, sound molds are the only way to wear headphones. Whether it be that they stay in my ear no matter what (especially if I'm working out), or providing a comfortable isolation of outside sounds, SoundMolds are like no other. If I'm in the library studying late at night, they block out any distraction.”  -  [college student]          “I am a50 year old very active man who has always had an issue with my earbuds falling out.  I must have small ears, because the standard buds that come with my headphones never seemed to fit me correctly.  Whenever I would be running, mountain biking or just working out at the gym, when I started to sweat at all they would fall out.  A friend told me about Soundmolds so I gave it a try.  I couldn’t be happier.  No matter what activity I am engaged in, they just stay in place and feel totally comfortable.  I’m never going back to off the shelf buds.“  - Scott K., Cincinnati, OH ""I have tiny ears so I stopped wearing earbuds because they never fit me well. Most earbuds would either hurt my ears or fall out. My SoundMolds have changed that for me and let me listen to my music again!""  - Melanie V. “I started using Sound Molds three months ago and I haven’t put them down since. I found the product online while searching for an earbud that fit properly. I have a pair of Plantronics, three pairs of beats and two pairs of Bose earbuds and none of them stay in my ear. Nor do they feel comfortable. Every time I purchase a pair of earbuds my ears hurt for at least the first week- they are all sold with small, medium, and large fittings but none of them properly sit in my ear.Then I found Sound Molds. A kit was shipped to me with very easy instructions on how to create the molds. It took me less than 10 min from unpackaging to repackaging and shipping them back to the company. Within a few weeks I received my Sound Molds and I literally haven’t taken them out of my head since! The fit is flawless. The sound is profound! If you’re looking for a headset that you will last you for years, one than you can actually hear and one that will stay in ear, buy this product.“ - Ryan R.  Thinking SoundMolds might be a good fit for you? Let’s see what would make you a good match:* Your current or previous earbuds have repeatedly fallen out* You dig comfort and quality* You don’t want to slowly go deaf* You think snuggling your ears in cushy, customized silicone sounds great* You want earbuds that will last* You appreciate a great sound experience* You’re not averse to making your friends jealous We’re committed to not only providing an innovative product we feel will change your life, but we’re also committed to working hard to ensure you have a great experience from start to finish.A lot of work went into this campaign, and we’ve made sure our ducks are in a row in order to fulfill our backers’ orders as soon as the campaign closes.You can feel confident backing SoundMolds because we’ve got a great relationship with a well-known manufacturer whose quality we stand behind.  Plus, the materials we’re using are so good that we’re happy to offer a full, 1-year  warranty against defects. FoundersJerry Altman (left) is board certified Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor. As an avid exerciser, he loves to listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks. He's been deaf in his left ear since childhood, so he is vigilant about protecting the hearing in his right ear from excess noise exposure.Amy Shah (right) is a double board certified MD in allergy/immunology and internal medicine. She is a big proponent of nutrition, and wellness integrated into western medicine -- she loves the intersection of wellness and productivity -- which is why she loves SoundMolds.Product Launch Team Like everyone else, we’re no strangers to the sound and fit issues most earbuds present, and that’s exactly why we created SoundMolds.And because we’re doctors, we want earbuds that not only prevent hearing loss by reducing the need for damaging volume levels, but offer a comfortable, hypoallergenic fit that’s actually good for your health.While researching solutions, we discovered that professional musicians and elite consumers had access to custom-fit earbuds, but only after visiting an audiologist and then paying a ridiculous sum to get the earbuds of their dreams several weeks later.We loved the concept, but not the wait, need to visit an audiologist, or insanely high price!And that’s what led to this campaign.We feel EVERYONE (not just celebrities or the ridiculously rich) should have access to great earbuds that are comfortable, stay put, and last year after year.

Anyone is free to join, and as you walk around the city, you hear sounds as you pass through the streets. <b>What sounds?</b> Anything goes, from tourist information to music, but for our first content we wanted to do something special, and invited two <b>sound artists</b> to give us their ""sonic vision"" of the city, through music and field recordings.</p><p>At its core, the Soundwalk is a smartphone app and a map of sounds. To explore a Soundwalk, you need headphones, and the phone must be equipped with GPS and optionally other location technologies. When you open a Soundwalk map, sounds will be played as if you are hearing them from a point, like surround sound, except <b>the arena is the real world</b>! That means, when you move around the sounds will appear to be coming from a particular location, and you can <b>discover</b> other sounds as you walk around.</p><p>We are a very small team of three passionately dedicated people based in Hanoi, creating interesting sonic projects, and we have already managed to raise core support for some areas of the project, but it’s not enough yet.<br/></p><p>Last year, the project was unfunded, but we still made it happen. This year we’re doing it in two cities at opposite ends of the world, Copenhagen and Hanoi, and offering two sound artists from those cities a unique opportunity to create a work of art for a new medium. In those two cities, the walk will be completely free for participants. We need your support to make it happen.</p><h2>What we need</h2><p>To make our project happen, we need a minimum of $5000. This money goes towards:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Paying talented Vietnamese composer <b>Lương Huệ Trinh</b> for her work on the project. We believe it’s essential to pay artists fairly for their work.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Flights to Denmark and accommodation. We need a presence in Denmark to organise the Soundwalk there, and make sure things run smoothly. Let us know if you want to help out by volunteering for the walk there!</span><br/>
</li>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Administrative support for the project. A significant amount of our time is going into this project; our costs are really low, but we still need money to cover our expenses.</span><br/>
</li>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">App development. We already have a small amount of money to pay for some development time, but this app will require hundreds of hours of work. We need to cover that time at a fair rate for our developer.</span><br/>

That would open a whole new dimension to the project.</p><p>This will allow people arriving in a city to select a tour to their fancy. Imagine being able to select a Historical Landmarks tour spoken by an experienced tour guide, or a Traditional Music tour that gave a unique insight into the music of a place, or even a Relaxing Soundscape tour that provided a different way of looking at your surroundings.</p><p>$10,000+ – For each $5000 we get above the budget, we will add a city to our itinerary.

Depending on how much you contribute, you could land yourself with access to our app before the Soundwalk project runs. Then you can try it out for yourself!</p><p>Want to be an integral part of the project? Sponsor a sound – you can have your name next to a sound on one of our first Soundwalks!</p><p>What about something to listen to the Soundwalk on, but you don't have a suitable smartphone? We've got brand new Nokia XLs on offer!</p><p>And a pair of kick-ass GPS location-enabled headphones to listen to it on too? We've got those too.</p><p>What about if you want the ultimate – a Soundwalk in your city now? Well, if we make our stretch goals and you contribute enough, we'll add a city, and you can vote for it!

We are experienced researchers and developers in the field of computer sound and music, we have experimented in real life, with an audience, several existing software options, have measured their limitations, and are now dedicated to producing, in close collaboration with our two sound artists, a software that will truly transform the physical space into a <b>canvas for sound creators</b> to “paint” on and turn a place into an actual consistent work of sonic art.</p><p></p><ul>

<p></p><p></p></div>","What is a Soundwalk?Short SummaryThe Soundwalk is an interactive, geo-locative audio tour. Anyone is free to join, and as you walk around the city, you hear sounds as you pass through the streets. What sounds? Anything goes, from tourist information to music, but for our first content we wanted to do something special, and invited two sound artists to give us their ""sonic vision"" of the city, through music and field recordings.At its core, the Soundwalk is a smartphone app and a map of sounds. To explore a Soundwalk, you need headphones, and the phone must be equipped with GPS and optionally other location technologies. When you open a Soundwalk map, sounds will be played as if you are hearing them from a point, like surround sound, except the arena is the real world! That means, when you move around the sounds will appear to be coming from a particular location, and you can discover other sounds as you walk around.We are a very small team of three passionately dedicated people based in Hanoi, creating interesting sonic projects, and we have already managed to raise core support for some areas of the project, but it’s not enough yet.Last year, the project was unfunded, but we still made it happen. This year we’re doing it in two cities at opposite ends of the world, Copenhagen and Hanoi, and offering two sound artists from those cities a unique opportunity to create a work of art for a new medium. In those two cities, the walk will be completely free for participants. We need your support to make it happen.What we needTo make our project happen, we need a minimum of $5000. This money goes towards:

Paying talented Vietnamese composer Lương Huệ Trinh for her work on the project. We believe it’s essential to pay artists fairly for their work.


Flights to Denmark and accommodation. We need a presence in Denmark to organise the Soundwalk there, and make sure things run smoothly. Let us know if you want to help out by volunteering for the walk there!


Administrative support for the project. A significant amount of our time is going into this project; our costs are really low, but we still need money to cover our expenses.


App development. We already have a small amount of money to pay for some development time, but this app will require hundreds of hours of work. We need to cover that time at a fair rate for our developer.


The remainder will go towards giving you your perks!

We have already obtained core funding for the project from the Danish Embassy in Vietnam’s Cultural Development and Exchange Fund which pays for:

Flights for our talented artists to Copenhagen and Denmark


Their accommodation and costs in both cities

Some money towards software development
We have also got support from the Danske Jazz Beat og Folkemusik Autorer (DJBFA) which pays for the fee of our talented Danish composer Hans SydowStretch budget$8,000 – We're really excited and hoping to reach this first stretch goal where we will add a Soundwalk Market for people to browse, access and upload Soundwalks for any location in the world. That would open a whole new dimension to the project.This will allow people arriving in a city to select a tour to their fancy. Imagine being able to select a Historical Landmarks tour spoken by an experienced tour guide, or a Traditional Music tour that gave a unique insight into the music of a place, or even a Relaxing Soundscape tour that provided a different way of looking at your surroundings.$10,000+ – For each $5000 we get above the budget, we will add a city to our itinerary. That means we’ll come and visit your city, create a special Soundwalk and run the walk there with our devices. If you contribute more than $500 you can vote towards what that city will be.What you getImagine, as the number of available Soundwalks develop, instead of ""what do I want to listen to today?"", you'll be wondering ""where do I want to listen to today?"".That's where our perks come in. Depending on how much you contribute, you could land yourself with access to our app before the Soundwalk project runs. Then you can try it out for yourself!Want to be an integral part of the project? Sponsor a sound – you can have your name next to a sound on one of our first Soundwalks!What about something to listen to the Soundwalk on, but you don't have a suitable smartphone? We've got brand new Nokia XLs on offer!And a pair of kick-ass GPS location-enabled headphones to listen to it on too? We've got those too.What about if you want the ultimate – a Soundwalk in your city now? Well, if we make our stretch goals and you contribute enough, we'll add a city, and you can vote for it! Not only that, we'll invite you along for a pre-run of the Soundwalk so you can experience it before anyone else.The ImpactThe Soundwalk project is unique. In Hanoi last year, this was the first time a project of its kind had happened in South-East Asia. We want to trump that this year with a global collaboration and more open accessibility. Everyone should be able to take part, at no cost to them.
You’ll be helping to make the Soundwalk 2014 happen. People like you will be able to go on the Soundwalk at no cost, and experience a magical audio tour in your own city.
Last year, the Hanoi Soundwalk ran for the first time in collaboration with the larger Locative Audio project which brought together soundwalks all over the world.
Our goal is make the Soundwalk a global project, which anyone in any city in the world can experience. We want to visit more cities, create more Soundwalks, and allow anyone to upload a Soundwalk they’ve created.

One great success of the 2013 Soundwalk was our work with visually-impaired children in Hanoi; by improving and polishing the software and content we hope to make it an experience widely accessible to the visually impaired community.
The AppSo we hear you say “What if I don’t live in Hanoi or Copenhagen? When is the Soundwalk coming to me?”. It will come to you in two ways.First, the Soundwalk creation app we’ll develop for this project finally gives content creators and audience access to the full creative potential of the “soundwalk” concept. We are experienced researchers and developers in the field of computer sound and music, we have experimented in real life, with an audience, several existing software options, have measured their limitations, and are now dedicated to producing, in close collaboration with our two sound artists, a software that will truly transform the physical space into a canvas for sound creators to “paint” on and turn a place into an actual consistent work of sonic art.

New app features will include, alongside the basic functions:


non circular areas, so the sound can track along a street


beat-synchronization of groups of sounds for musical Soundwalks


conditional sequencing of sounds, enabling ‘story-telling’


precise control of spatialization options for individual sounds, with true 3D audio


non-location specific sounds, to enable ‘introductions’ or in-app notifications


partially randomized sounds or sound parameters


and much more -- we will work closely with both of our sound artists to develop new features based on their needs.

This way we’re giving you and others all the tools you need to create and share truly seamless and immersive Soundwalks in the places you care about.And if you don’t quite feel like turning into a creator just yet, no worries: we also want to add to the player app a ReMap feature that will allow you to transpose any created Map from its original area onto your city or town, so you can experience any city without the hassle of taking a flight there, and enjoy the improbable encounter of sounds designed for that place with your daily environment.PressLast year we were covered by a number of publications in Hanoi:TV:VTC10 Program - Nghe dạo Hà Nội: Hành trình khám phá lịch sử sống Hà Nội qua âm thanh.

</div></div>","World's First Wireless Headset to Stream Music, Podcasts, & Live Coaching UnderwaterWater sports have been under-served by technology for too long. Say goodbye to clunky MP3 players and pesky cords. Zygo is an IP68 waterproof headset and transmitter compatible with any smart device. We spent two years developing our patent-pending solution that will change the way you experience the water.  Stream High-Quality Audio UnderwaterWe believe that the inability to stream audio in the water is a critical barrier to widespread enjoyment of swimming and other water sports. We developed Zygo to enable high-quality streaming audio with any phone (or audio source). Play Spotify, a podcast, audio book, or Peloton-style guided workouts using the Zygo App. Non-Invasive Bone Conduction TechnologyThe Zygo headset uses bone conduction to send audio through vibrations against the zygomatic arch, leaving your ears open for comfort and safety.  Completely Wireless Out of the box, Zygo comes with: a headset, transmitter, and charging case. The headset and transmitter connect wirelessly, so you can stream all of your audio cord-free. The carrying case doubles as a charging station. Using the micro USB cable that comes with it, plug the case into any outlet to charge both units simultaneously.   Bluetooth can't penetrate the water, so we use a radio frequency transmitter as middleman. The transmitter stays on land with your phone and streams its audio to the headset. It doubles as a walkie-talkie for real time one-way communication.Zygo is the only technology that lets you stream live, online audio underwater from your favorite apps.  Range The exact range depends on how deep you are and the type of water (salt water versus fresh water makes a big difference). At 2 feet below the surface in a chlorinated swimming pool, the range should be 50 meters. Since our head is normally at the surface when we swim, the range should be greater in most cases. Above the water - for activities like standup paddle boarding and windsurfing - the range is up to half a mile. Live One-Way CommunicationThe handheld transmitter doubles as a walkie talkie with a built-in push-to-talk mic that allows anyone to reach you, be it for real time coaching or a safety alert. Zygo AppThe Zygo App contains pre-recorded workouts to simulate live coaching sessions. You’ll gain instant access to a growing library of content designed for swimming, paddle boarding, and more! Enhance your favorite activities with structured training material and upbeat music. App Features

Quick Start. Select a workout by time or distance.

The Zygo App is free to download and free to use through 2019. What Makes Zygo Better Than Other Earbuds & Headsets?Not Just SwimmingWhile the initial idea came from swimming, we quickly realized that Zygo could enhance other water sports such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, surfing, stand up paddle boarding, and more.Unlike other products that clip to goggles, Zygo is a versatile solution for all of these outdoor activities. It can be worn with sunglasses and under a hat, and we plan to offer accessories such as a wetsuit clip. Backed By Olympians, Athletes, & World-Class Coaches PerksZygo is only available on Indiegogo with our biggest discount at up to 40% Off.  Plus, we're offering Free Shipping to all of our Indiegogo backers!Pledge now to take advantage of exclusive Early Bird pricing and be the first to experience wireless audio streaming underwater! Product Details Our Story Like all kids, we loved swimming when we were little.

Designed to share the magic of music with the entire family, including the youngest ones.
A portable music player with built-in high-quality speakers
Uses figurines, not a screen to choose what music is played
Designed to be kid-proof: strong, safe and with smart parental controls
Plays files stored on Jooki (sourced from CD's, iTunes, ...)
Supports streaming from internet radio's and streaming services (Spotify, ...)
Works as a Bluetooth speaker for your phone
www.jooki.rocks As kids, the music and stories on tapes & CDs enriched our lives. As geek dads, we love the advances in technology but we see them leaving our family behind when it comes to music.With Jooki we designed an easy and magical music player that allows kids to choose their own music or stories without a distracting screen. The kids dance freely to music and stories fire their imagination.With Jooki kids choose what they want to listen to, and when they do so. But parents set the boundaries. So they can share their love of music and spoken word without worries. No screen in sight.Jooki plays anything: it doesn't matter whether it's an offline MP3 or an online streaming service. We're committed to bring all major streaming services to Jooki so that you can offer an unlimited catalog to your kids. But again, the parents stay in control.We are starting with Spotify support so that your kids will be able to play their favorite playlist, be it “Kids Workout”, “Disney” or “Once upon a time”.   Jooki is a music player with a simple, intuitive user interface for all ages. Jooki is a standalone jukebox that plays from on-board storage and also a wireless speaker that streams from the phone or the cloud.The Jooki Stars make Jooki shine. The Stars are figurines and tokens that start a playlist (song, story, album or internet radio station). Perfect for kids: they simply place a Star on Jooki to choose what they want to listen to.The parents app isn’t required to play music but lets you stay in control and upload the music you want to share with the family.Easy & Fun - Simply place a Star on Jooki to play the music you want.    Listening to music or stories has never been so easy and fun! Kids love the independence Jooki gives them. They get to choose the music and stories to listen to without having to ask an adult for help. And with no screen in sight, kids listen and play without distractions.   The Jooki Stars are beautiful figurines and practical tokens that can be linked to your children’s favorite playlists.The figurines are fun, colourful characters and easy for small hands to grasp. The tokens are flat with fun designs (or use your own stickers). Both types of Star work exactly the same way and have suction cups so they don’t fall off Jooki.  Managing music on Jooki is easy
Choose the music you want to listen to. You can upload music from your phone using the Jooki app or drag-and-drop from iTunes on your laptop. You can also choose a Spotify playlist or an internet radio station.
Create a playlist (or have Jooki create one for you).
Choose the Star you want to link to the playlist and put it on Jooki. Done.
A playlist is one or more songs, stories, albums, or online radio stations.  Kids love to be in control of the world and Jooki gives them this independent access to their music and stories. At the same time the parents app lets you set boundaries. You choose when the kids can use Jooki and the media available on the device. You can set the maximum volume and you can always use the app as a remote control. The app is free and easy to use!  Jooki is designed for demanding children, but as parents ourselves, we demand quality, safety and ease of use. Jooki works on-the-go, bedroom or living room, inside or outside and of course it sounds great! In the box - 1x Jooki, 1x Figurine Star, 5x Token Stars, 1x charging cable  You will be able to choose your figurine type(s) after the campaign; we'll send you an email.  Founding Team - Theo, Will & PieterTheo MarescauxTheo was the Product Manager for 40% of the world’s digital cinema projectors that show movies to millions of people around the world.

<h1>Funding Goal</h1>
<p>The Volcano shown on this page is our fully working prototype.  With your support, we will manufacture the Volcano and deliver it to your doorstep.  The funding goal of $50,000 is necessary for manufacturing costs allocated towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production costs (Molds, tooling, assembly, components, quality control)</li>
<li>Packaging and peripherals</li>
<li>Electronics certifications</li>
<li>Distribution to end users</li>
</ul>
<p>We want everyone to experience the Volcano first hand.  Therefore we have allocated our own budget towards non-manufacturing costs related to the production of Volcano including R&amp;D, design, development, project management, logistics, support, and risks of production and financial risks.  </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Production Plan</h1>
<p>We have lined up excellent manufacturing partners, and will deliver the Volcano according to the schedule in the campaign.  Upon funding of this IndieGoGo campaign, we will proceed to manufacturing the first Volcano units. </p>
<p>Because we have already completed the prototype stage, we are in the position to shorten the manufacturing cycle and deliver the units in the shortest possible time according to the schedule.  Additional minor project tasks to be completed include product improvement tweaks, packaging design, quality control, and detailed user manual creation.</p>
<p>Our passion is development, production and manufacturing.  We have manufactured significant number of products and components in the past and have always met or exceeded our production timetables.  We know the nature of the challenges we may encounter and how to overcome them.  We look forward to communicating with you, and can't wait for you to get your own Volcano.</p>

Audio lovers, musicians, DJs, everyone - hear your music on the Volcano and be blown away by the audio quality and rich bass.

















Compact enough to travel with, bring to the party or barbecue...while packing the punch of a traditional entertainment center for a fraction of the price.






Frustrated with the common problem with Bluetooth speakers, little or no bass...


We decided to create an entirely new type of speaker that not only sounds great but also gives you the option to get that bigger kick.
You can now attach the Volcano speaker to its base containing an amazing bass sub-woofer.  Press play and be ready for an audio explosion to hear your music the way it's meant to be heard.










The Volcano is an epiphany in wireless Bluetooth audio speaker design and rich audio quality.
Use the Volcano separately, or attach it to its base to hear your favorite music with a full dynamic audio range.



We designed and built it to give you the option to add an awesome bass sub-woofer.

Press play and be ready for an audio explosion to hear your music the way it's meant to be heard.









Enjoy the freedom. No longer is your phone, tablet or other device chained to your speakers.
No cords to get tangled or lost. Enjoy the party. No need to leave your phone behind or have it accidentally picked up.












Volcano works on all devices, whether it be a mobile phone (iOs, Android or Windows), tablet, laptop, Smart TV etc. Simply connect via Bluetooth.






Why we invented the Volcano.
A common problem we kept hearing with all the other small and different sized wireless bluetooth speakers is no bass or not enough of it.  How can we listen to our favorite tracks without the bass?
The Volcano taking shape in an early design drawing:


So we set out to develop an entirely new type of wireless bluetooth speaker with more bass.  Along the way in the creative development process, a number of fun and innovative milestones were achieved, including the new shape and design of the speaker.  The Volcano was born!
How we invented the Volcano and why it works so well...
Frustrated with the common problem with bluetooth speakers - either little or no bass - we decided to create an entirely new type of speaker that not only sounds great but also gives you the option to get that bigger kick. Realizing our idea to reality was a lot of fun and led to a number of creative highlights along the way.


Early beginnings of the project dubbed the inverted muffin.
Our concept was to create a two part wireless audio system comprised of a mini bluetooth speaker that could be attached on top of a base stand housing a sub-woofer speaker to work together.  The idea was to give the listener the option to take their audio experience to the next level at any time, or to utilize the top speaker separately with its own excellent audio quality. 
We started with a standard cylindrical shaped top speaker with some interesting shapes for the bottom speaker design ensuing during the early parts of the development, including the above inverted muffin shape.
Early concept hand drawings of the Volcano.


Unimpressed with the audio quality of the early prototypes, we went back to the drawing board and re-thought the development process to focus first and foremost on the highest attainable audio quality. 
We recruited the best audio engineers and experts, and re-thought the industrial and mechanical designs.  We kept testing and re-testing for maximum audio fidelity, experiencing a dramatic boost in the audio output.  We not only set our attention on the base, but were also inspired to try a trapezoidal shape for the top part.
Our idea for a trapezoidal shape of the top speaker led to a familiar resemblance.



After heavy development and prototyping work, we think we nailed the result which we're now proud to share with you.  Simply put, the Volcano sounds awesome and we can't wait for you to have one.

Volcano is great for use indoors & outdoors and is extremely durable.

Gamesky Review Note 20:  One look at Note 20, you are immediately reminded of the simple and useful Post-it note. Note 20 shares its pleasing and familiar shape as well as its helpful features: it’s a reminder, a helper, and a communicator. Our hope is that like a Post-it, Note 20 becomes a useful part of your day too! It’s helpful, reliable, and brings the exciting world of sound to you.  Ergonomic design and compact size makes Note 20 extremely comfortable. With a thickness of only 13.55 mm, this unique flat design improves fit and comfort especially for long listening sessions. Unlike other earbuds on the market, Note 20 earbuds have a low-profile fit that doesn’t protrude too far out of the ear. In fact, the earbuds cannot be seen from behind when worn my most people.  Ultimately thin! The see-through structure of the Note 20 case lets you immediately see the current status of your earbuds, whether they are charging, in shut-down mode, or removed from the case. When Note 20 is lying on your desk, it’s a reminder for you to take a relaxing music break.The Note 20 earbuds in the case are only 1/3rd the size of an iPhone 11 Pro Max. They are compact and small enough to fit in any pocket or purse.  A combination of comfort and freedom. We solved the problem of typical earbuds – resulting in comfortable long time use, fit, and in-ear depth. The innovative dual zone fixation mode provides a firm and secure fit. You can adjust the best wearing angle by simply rotating the earbuds to achieve the best fit for your unique ear-canal shape. asymmetrically designed to fit perfectly in either ear. The front surface and sides of the ear tip meet up perfectly with the ear canal, so you won’t get a foreign object sensation, pressure or discomfort. You will feel safe and comfy instead. For earbuds to be truly comfortable for a long listening sessions, the way they fit in the ear canal is crucial. Earbuds that extend too far into the ear can cause pain, itching and a heavy feel. Others, such as Airpods that rest too far outside the ear, suffer from compromised sound quality. Note 20 did exhaustive testing and refinement for an ergonomic patented ‘short in-ear’ design that gives ultimate comfort, seals perfectly and delivers better sound. Note 20 delivers premium sound with minimal audio delay for a powerful, immersive listening experience. They redefine the mobile audio experience with an exceptional design and cutting-edge audio technology. With 4-4.5 hours play time, you can embrace music world freely. The design is focused on a premium appearance. The first spraying layer is for eye-catching color, the second is a pearl aluminum powder that gives Note 20 a special metal texture, the final matte paint finish adds deeper texture to it. The result is a stunning bright look from afar with subtle details up close.We offer 4 colors for Note 20. The Coral Orange is for the young and passionate. The Christmas Green is subtle and comfortable. The Pearl White has a pure and clean look. The Classic Black is calm and steady. You can choose the color that best suits your mood. With the strong magnetic built-in and the transparent structure, you will never lose your Note 20. The square charging case and asymmetric design of Note 20 is stunningly different. The project earned a Red Dot award for its design concept and was recognized by the International Design Excellence Awards for its unique industrial design.Patent protected unique structure makes taking out and putting back earbuds more fun than ever.

Having raised over $715,000+ on their first crowdfunding campaign, successfully delivering the headsets to backers, and now one of the top ranking Amazon wireless earbuds, Diifa is returning to Indiegogo to debut Touch.</p><p>Touch has been crowd-created from over 2 years of user feedback and community input. Here are some of the top concerns raised by our earliest supporters and how we have improved and solved many of them.</p><ul>
<li>Although Dot Headset features a dynamic driver speaker for accurate sound with a full frequency range, the sound quality was still limited by the DSP (digital sound processor). Touch features a completely redesigned chipset and processor with 2X the processing featuring 96 MIPS dual-MAC DSP (MIPS = Mega Instructions Per Second). This is a large improvement from the original Dot's 48 MIPS. This boils down to improved acoustics performance for better sound quality, and more accurate voice processing.<br/> </li>
<li>Now, Touch automatically turns on and connects with your phone when removed from the charging pod. This is a functional improvement from the previous turn on + pair procedure which takes a few seconds. By automating this step, you just pop the Touch earbuds out of the charging pod and you are ready to go!<br/> </li>
<li>With the upgrade to Bluetooth 4.2, Touch adds a layer of privacy upgrades and increased speed reducing the latency for smooth audio playback. Our engineers are actually researching Bluetooth 5.0 so stay tuned for more announcements.<br/> </li>
<li>The biggest visible improvement on Touch is the slight angle of the ear-tip. The number one requested feature was to improve the ergonomics of the design for a more secure fit. With a slight angle, Touch directs sound more directly into the ear without comprising on comfort.</li>

Our engineers have simplified the experience into a single touch sensitive surface. The minimalist approach is easier to use, and with less mechanical failures.Designed with portability in mind, the charging pod is slim and elegantly styled for pockets of all sizes. The charging pod fully encloses your Touch earbuds for protection and fully charges your buds without any cables or wires. Redesigned for the perfect fit, Touch is slightly curved to follow the natural flow of the human ear. This allows Touch to rest comfortably on the outer ear while directing sound optimally into your ear.    Touch earbuds are the perfect companion for running, biking, hiking, trail running, climbing, or any other activity. With IPX5 sweat/water resistant features, work out to your favorite tunes with a Bluetooth headset that can keep up. Using safe and reliable German designed coin cells manufactured by VARTA, the extended battery is a 60 mAh providing up to 3 hours of music playback, and 3 hours of talk time on a single charge. Combined with the charging pod, Touch can provide 6+ hours for talk and music and up to 120+ hours on standby.The Touch charging pod comes with sleek rounded corners and is perfectly pocketable and portable.

 Touch will officially be using the latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology, giving you all of the benefits of the most up-to-date and advanced wireless audio capabilities:SpeedWith twice as much speed as the previous version, Bluetooth 5.0 gives you faster pairing and data transfer with no audio/video delay.RangeBluetooth 5.0 has increased it’s max range fourfold, giving you about 150 extra meters of distance between your device and your Bluetooth headset. Indoor use has now increased from a 10 meter range to 40 meters, allowing for the potential of whole home wireless connectivity. Never worry about having to be in the same room as your device again.DataThe amount of transferable data has increased by 800% allowing much richer data to be sent and received.PowerLow energy functionality is perfect for devices that are needed to run for longer lengths of time, such as coin cell batteries, making Touch extremely power-efficient and extending battery life.InterferenceRefinements have been made to Bluetooth 5.0 reducing interference with other wireless technologies to ensure your devices can coexist in the increasingly complex wireless environment.  Perfect for your favorite digital assistant from Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, or Google Assistant - Touch is compatible with all of the above and more.Multipoint: Technology that allows Touch to be connected to multiple Bluetooth devices at the same time. When answering a call on a second device, Touch recognizes which device is ringing and will connect to the correct device automatically.Packet Loss Concealment: PLC means that Touch is optimized for digital communications and to maintain the best possible sound quality. You will notice a significant improvement especially when making Skype or Facetime calls which use voice over internet protocols (VoIP).  Touch is the latest generation from the team behind the first “World’s Smallest Earbud” also known as Dot Headset on Indiegogo. Having raised over $715,000+ on their first crowdfunding campaign, successfully delivering the headsets to backers, and now one of the top ranking Amazon wireless earbuds, Diifa is returning to Indiegogo to debut Touch.Touch has been crowd-created from over 2 years of user feedback and community input. Here are some of the top concerns raised by our earliest supporters and how we have improved and solved many of them.
Although Dot Headset features a dynamic driver speaker for accurate sound with a full frequency range, the sound quality was still limited by the DSP (digital sound processor). Touch features a completely redesigned chipset and processor with 2X the processing featuring 96 MIPS dual-MAC DSP (MIPS = Mega Instructions Per Second). This is a large improvement from the original Dot's 48 MIPS. This boils down to improved acoustics performance for better sound quality, and more accurate voice processing. 
Now, Touch automatically turns on and connects with your phone when removed from the charging pod. This is a functional improvement from the previous turn on + pair procedure which takes a few seconds. By automating this step, you just pop the Touch earbuds out of the charging pod and you are ready to go! 
With the upgrade to Bluetooth 4.2, Touch adds a layer of privacy upgrades and increased speed reducing the latency for smooth audio playback. Our engineers are actually researching Bluetooth 5.0 so stay tuned for more announcements. 
The biggest visible improvement on Touch is the slight angle of the ear-tip. The number one requested feature was to improve the ergonomics of the design for a more secure fit. With a slight angle, Touch directs sound more directly into the ear without comprising on comfort.
 Inside you will receive 1 Touch charging pod, 1 left and 1 right earbud, 3 different eartip sizes to ensure the perfect fit, and a micro-USB charging cable. Prototype Walk-through UpdateCheck out this video we made to show a quick walk-through of Touch.

That’s why we created Ximalaya with the next generation of noise cancellation and audio technology to make quiet sounds quieter and music sound even better. So you can simply listen, without anything in the way. Ximalaya H9 headphones are engineered to sound better, be more comfortable, and super easy to take with you. Put them on and suddenly your world changes. Music is rich, powerful, and balanced, and so quiet that every note sounds distinct and clear. Even flying becomes enjoyable, as loud plane engines noise gently fades away. No matter how loud the world around you is, all that surrounds you is your music—or just peace and quiet.Ximalaya H9 headphones let you focus on the things that matter—your music and videos. They eliminate the noise you don't want to hear. Like a busy street. The whirring noise of an airplane engine. Or the bustling office.Take pleasure in silence They say you can’t get long battery life from noise canceling headphones. We say, “Think again”. Enjoy up to 55 hours of listening with ANC, enough time to hear to over 900+ songs with noise cancelling. That’s more than 2 straight days of music!We believe you should never sacrifice sound quality for the convenience of wireless headphones. So we never did. Connecting through Bluetooth 4.2 and using an advanced audio coding process, Ximalaya Wireless headphones maintain only the highest quality wireless signal — with no loss in clarity. The highs sound vibrant and energetic while lows are rich, deep and powerful. This is a whole new level of wireless audio quality.Every piece of the Ximalaya was designed to reduce noise. Even the ear cushions help seal out noise by forming a gentle seal around your ears.The Ximalaya Wireless headphones support both Wired and Wireless Bluetooth connections.

<p style=""margin-left:5px;color: #333333;"">Pulse DAC is an audio digital-to-analog converter and headphone amplifier that was crowd-designed and crowd-funded here on Indiegogo! Since we launched the campaign, word has spread quickly and Pulse DAC has become the most successful crowd-designed high performance audio component in the world. 1,262 backers (who we lovingly call ""Geek Force"") have contributed to its development, helping us to pre-sell over 9000 units.</p>
<h5 style=""color: #ea1e3b;margin-left:10px;line-height: 10px !important;"">What does Pulse DAC do?<br/><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/geekpulse3/images/h5_border-bottom.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h5>
<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;"">Many people don't know this, but our human ears can't actually hear digital audio.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;"">Digital data has to be converted into analog before we can hear it. To do this, we use digital-to-analog converters, also known as DACs.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/geekpulse3/images/Inner_Ear_Analog_Yes.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;"">DACs are everywhere: in our phones, in our cable boxes, in our computers. Seriously. They're everywhere. The problem with the DACs that we find in all of our devices is simple: they're made to do the job with the least amount of effort and the lowest cost to build.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;"">Pulse DAC is designed to differently. Instead of just barely getting the job done, it goes the extra mile to get the job done well. Very well. So well that there's no other DAC that can do what it does without having to pay three times the price.</p>
<h5 style=""color: #ea1e3b;margin-left:10px;line-height: 10px !important;"">Three different configurations.<br/><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/geekpulse3/images/h5_border-bottom.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;""><strong>Pulse DAC:</strong> This is what others might call a base model, but we prefer to think of it as where awesome starts.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;""><strong>Pulse DAC X:</strong> This is a fully-balanced, dual mono version of Pulse DAC. On the front, in addition to the 1/4"" stereo headphone jack, you get a four-pin balanced headphone output. On the back, there's another way for your stereo: a pair of balanced XLR outputs.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:10px;color: #333333;""><strong>Pulse DAC Xfi:</strong> This is Pulse DAC X on steroids. Remember that optional dual femto clock upgrade? This is where you get it.

<p style=""margin-left:5px;color: #333333;"">LPS stands for ""linear power supply."" If you really want to get the most out of Pulse DAC, PULSE LPS is a must.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;color: #333333;"">Pulse LPS takes dirty AC power from the wall and delivers clean DC power to Pulse DAC. This clean DC power has very low noise, which improves the sonic quality of the music coming out of Geek Pulse. With clean power, you get more natural music.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;color: #333333;"">As an added feature, Pulse LPS can be used to clean the noise off of the USB connection from your computer to Pulse DAC. Just connect your computer to Pulse LPS using a USB cable, then connect Pulse LPS to Pulse DAC (or any USB DAC, for that matter) using a second USB Cable. When you do this, Pulse LPS disconnects the 5V power coming over the USB cable from the computer and replaces it with clean (under 6uV noise) 5V power coming from its super-regulated power circuits.</p>

New to high performance audio?  No worries!  We've got something that'll tickle your fancy.



High Performance Portable Audio Player

 
Awesomify Your Listening Room






Pulse DAC (Back to Top)


Pulse DAC is an audio digital-to-analog converter and headphone amplifier that was crowd-designed and crowd-funded here on Indiegogo! Since we launched the campaign, word has spread quickly and Pulse DAC has become the most successful crowd-designed high performance audio component in the world. 1,262 backers (who we lovingly call ""Geek Force"") have contributed to its development, helping us to pre-sell over 9000 units.
What does Pulse DAC do?

Many people don't know this, but our human ears can't actually hear digital audio.

Digital data has to be converted into analog before we can hear it. To do this, we use digital-to-analog converters, also known as DACs.

DACs are everywhere: in our phones, in our cable boxes, in our computers. Seriously. They're everywhere. The problem with the DACs that we find in all of our devices is simple: they're made to do the job with the least amount of effort and the lowest cost to build.
Pulse DAC is designed to differently. Instead of just barely getting the job done, it goes the extra mile to get the job done well. Very well. So well that there's no other DAC that can do what it does without having to pay three times the price.
Three different configurations.

Pulse DAC: This is what others might call a base model, but we prefer to think of it as where awesome starts.
Pulse DAC X: This is a fully-balanced, dual mono version of Pulse DAC. On the front, in addition to the 1/4"" stereo headphone jack, you get a four-pin balanced headphone output. On the back, there's another way for your stereo: a pair of balanced XLR outputs.


Pulse DAC Xfi: This is Pulse DAC X on steroids. Remember that optional dual femto clock upgrade? This is where you get it. It also has upgraded passive components (capacitors and resistors) as well as upgraded active components (opamps and controllers). 


Pulse LPS (Back to Top)


LPS stands for ""linear power supply."" If you really want to get the most out of Pulse DAC, PULSE LPS is a must.
Pulse LPS takes dirty AC power from the wall and delivers clean DC power to Pulse DAC. This clean DC power has very low noise, which improves the sonic quality of the music coming out of Geek Pulse. With clean power, you get more natural music.
As an added feature, Pulse LPS can be used to clean the noise off of the USB connection from your computer to Pulse DAC. Just connect your computer to Pulse LPS using a USB cable, then connect Pulse LPS to Pulse DAC (or any USB DAC, for that matter) using a second USB Cable. When you do this, Pulse LPS disconnects the 5V power coming over the USB cable from the computer and replaces it with clean (under 6uV noise) 5V power coming from its super-regulated power circuits.
Special note: With USB 2.0, cable length is very important. You cannot go longer that five meters in total length and expect consistent results. Because Geek LPS does not incude a repeater or amplifier (due to noise concerns), the sum of the lengths of both the input and output USB cables cannot exceed five meters.
Two different configurations.

Pulse LPS: This is Pulse DAC's linear power supply buddy that we told you about earlier. It has one 120 or 240 volt AC input, one 12 volt DC output, one USB input, and one USB output.

Pulse LPS4: This is just like Pulse LPS, but it has four 12 volt DC outputs instead of just one. It's perfect for other audio gear you might have that uses 12V DC power.




Accessories for your Pulse Audio Components (Back to Top)

We've created these little goodies that match up perfectly to your Pulse Source, Pulse DAC, or Pulse LPS.
LightSpeed 1G USB Cable: LightSpeed 1G is an affordable high-end USB cable that boasts more than twice the bandwidth of USB 2.0's Audio Specification standard. Due to its wide bandwidth, the USB controller inside your DAC isn't overburdened when jitter makes its way into the signal, making your DAC run optimally and signal noise-free.

Evermix is opening the door to all DJs, Promoters, Venues & Brands around the world for the first time.We're a small team of electronic music fans with decades of experience working in the industry - working as DJs, in promotions, for major music brands, and of course with a background in technology companies!We’re excited to release our second generation MixBox to the wider community. For the last year we’ve been listening carefully to the feedback from DJs using the first version of the MixBox and working hard to improve both the hardware and supporting software. We’re ready to bring a product to market that we’re extremely proud of, and it’s just the first step to our goal of making Evermix available to everyone in Electronic Music on a global scale.We think that Evermix will change the way DJ sets are captured to allow music fans to relive nights over and over again - and you can see what DJs think of us further down the page! Help us save thousands of hours of lost music!We're looking to raise £20,000 to push the button on the immediate manufacture of the MixBox2.Over the last year we've worked with hundreds of top-draw DJs, Promoters, and Venues to improve on the first beta-product - the MixBox.  Now, with your help, we're ready to go with the new and improved version!By helping to fund the campaign you'll be one of the first in the world to receive the new MixBox2 with portable carry case - at low prices we won't offer again. You'll also join our 'Founder Member' list, meaning you'll always receive premium account upgrades for free, and you'll be first in the queue for additional perks and benefits as we continue to grow and develop new features on evermix.fm (our music streaming website) and our DJ App.If you're looking for something ultra-unique, we're creating 100 units in two additional finishes - brushed gold and stealth black. If we don't reach our funding goal don't worry - we'll still produce the MixBoxes and your order will be fulfilled. It might take us a few weeks longer, but we can guarantee that you'll receive your product. Top DJs are already loving Evermix Join a high-calibre of DJs, Promoters, and Clubs.The first generation MixBox and the Evermix DJ app have already been distributed and used by established DJs, clubs and promoters including the likes of Josh Butler, Roger Sanchez, Miguel Campbell, Eli & Fur, Camilo Franco, Motion Bristol and Sankeys Ibiza, plus many more global names and brands.Have a look at our site evermix.fm to get an idea of who's using the MixBox already, and check out the brilliant sound quality.We've included a long list of quotes further down the page (we thought you'd want to get onto the product info first), but here's Doorly, one of the first to use a MixBox, with a few thoughts:Doorly: “This is the app and device I’ve been looking for my entire career. I must have been through 20 different set recorders which have all had their own issues as well as being super expensive or non-durable for a touring DJ. Evermix is a recorder built to work with your mobile phone which is always by your side and the app makes the whole process incredibly slick and social for its users and fans. Now I’m just excited for this to be released and used by everyone so we can really enjoy its power.” MixBox2 product informationSTAY FULLY IN CONTROLDuring setup and recording, the MixBox2 provides the DJ with clear visual feedback: the LED indicator glows white when correctly connected, blue when an audio signal is recognised, and red when the audio signal is clipping.After the set is over full control is given to the DJ to choose what they publish and to where; social sharing is made easy to Facebook, Twitter, and even to other music streaming sites. Soon, DJs will be able to communicate with their fans directly from within the Evermix DJ App.AMAZING SOUND QUALITYExtreme care was taken during the design process to ensure that audio quality was never compromised. The MixBox2 features a high quality Analogue to Digital Converter with a smooth noise floor with no audible tones, and is capable of recording DJ sets in lossless WAV, 320kbps, or 192kbps AAC.DURABLE, SLEEK DESIGN… IMPOSSIBLY PORTABLEManufactured in the UK in partnership with Coomber Specialist Sound Solutions, the MixBox2 features an aluminium casing with annodised aluminium ends. The device is small enough to fit into all but the tightest of pockets, and comes packaged with a handy Evermix branded carry-case.ULTRA LOW POWER CONSUMPTIONMixBox2 is powered by the DJ’s iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and can record for many hours without any additional external power, removing any audio noise problems associated with using an external USB power supply. During testing, impressive power-usage results were achieved: a one hour set used just 10% of an iPhone 7 battery with screen off, and 20% with screen constantly on.  If preferred, the MixBox2 can also be powered via the Micro USB socket. What our Founder Members say about EvermixEvermix has made it possible for me to record my sets and post them in the most mobile, compact and secure way I have found to date- Kudos on making this happen!Roger Sanchez Evermix is the perfect recording solution for me as a DJ.

<p>SRAY is a directional speaker that produces a directional beam of sound, sort of like a spotlight for sound. This means if you are standing in front of SRAY when it's on, you will hear the sound it produces. If you step to the side, you won't hear anything produced by SRAY. In comparison, the speakers we are used to tending to emit sound radially, filling an entire space around it with sound.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569898512/xzrpf7kcitm4fpqpb0cb.png"" src=""""/></p>

SRAY is the smallest directional speaker that creates fields of sound which spread less than most traditional speakers by ultrasonic waves. SRAY generates ultrasonic waves modulated with an audio signal and as they pass through the air they modulated and sound can be.

 
 
 


 

 
SRAY by CatchFlow attended as a spin-off company from Samsung Electronics at CES 2018 and got a lot of attention, was well received by industry experts and consumers.

 
 
 


 


 


 


 


 

 
 


 
*Please watching this clip with your headphone. You’ll see what we’re talking about.*
 

 
 
 





SRAY is a directional speaker that produces a directional beam of sound, sort of like a spotlight for sound. This means if you are standing in front of SRAY when it's on, you will hear the sound it produces. If you step to the side, you won't hear anything produced by SRAY. In comparison, the speakers we are used to tending to emit sound radially, filling an entire space around it with sound.

 
 



Earbuds or headphones enable you to listen with disturbing nobody. However, headphones and earbuds cause damage to your ears the same way other loud noises too, resulting in what audiologists call ‘noise-induced hearing loss (a.k.a NHL)’. Over time the sounds from your headphones cause the hair cells in the cochlea to bend down too much or too severely. If they don't get time to recover, the damage can be permanent. So here we have the solution, SRAY, headphone-replacing sound generator.

Just like when you look for a specific flavour while cooking your favorite dish, depending on the sound you want to obtain, these circuits are formed by different ingredients (electronic components of the highest quality), with which we build filters and amplification stages that fulfill very specialized tasks.</p><p>Also, five of our <i>Flavours Preamps</i> incorporate a crucial ingredient: a <strong>premium input transformer</strong>.</p><p>The transformer amplifies the signal by passing it through a copper winding around a metal core that excites the signal and gives it an extra dose of harmonics: pure colour and tasty sound. Choosing a transformer is not an easy task. There are hundreds and hundreds of manufacturers, models, and features to try until you find the one which best fits the purpose, the flavour we are looking for.</p><p>Thanks to our extensive experience in the world of ProAudio, we know and work with the best international brands of transformers. Therefore, we have selected models of prestigious brands such as <i>Carnhill</i>® (UK) and <i>Lundahl</i>® (Sweeden).</p><p>Each of the selected transformers is specially designed to provide even or odd harmonics to your sound, more or less saturation, amplification, colour, and even noise, and all in an incredibly musical way!<br/> </p><h2>We need your support!</h2><p><strong>Now, we need your support to refine the prototype of each model.</strong></p><p>On the one hand, expanding and improving the electronics so that each <i>Flavour Preamp</i> is much more evident and different, but also so that the exterior finish of the chassis is totally professional, for example with a more durable paint.</p><p>In addition, we have thought of a minimalist and ecological packaging design that allows you to take your <i>Flavour Preamp</i> anywhere in complete safety, without using plastic, but rather recycled and recyclable materials.</p><p><strong>Thank you very much for supporting us and for sharing this campaign with your friends!</strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609175888/mkymbalpwub6ib6esi6c.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610790693/r1ffy6ksumxvafrkczzj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Rewards will begin to be sent around February 15, 2021, in order of contribution.</p><p><strong>***</strong> Due to the heavy snow storm that has kept Madrid isolated for several days, the logistics agencies of our suppliers have not functioned normally, so we may suffer an extraordinary delay of between 7 and 10 days.

We always want to reduce he internal wiring, minimizing mechanical contacts and hugely shortening the analog audio paths. Our PCBs will facilitate many maintenance processes and will be more efficient and green than never. Electrical isolation will also be much better against high-frequency interferences and we’ll also improve heat dissipation from the power supply units. </p><p>We only work with first-class brands on the market and materials of the highest quality. By making the case and knobs in steel, we ensure the highest durability, lightness, corrosion resistance and thermal insulation.</p><p>We prioritize the use of recycled or recyclable materials. Most of them can be reused without losing any of their properties. By creating this circular supply chain, we reduce the need for virgin materials being mined from the earth and give them a second chance to get into the market. And it goes without saying that we follow WEEE regulations!  Also, we have designed our packaging not only to be the best bodyguard our gear may have ever dreamt of, but also to be one element that can be reused.</p><p>It is our mission to use as little plastic as possible and minimize virgin elements usage.  When starting a new design, our top priority is choosing the right materials. We make sure every single component is RoHS compliant. Substances such as lead, mercury, or cadmium (among others) are totally out of the game for being dangerous to the environment and pollute landfills.  We look at lifespan and recyclability, too; that's why we decided steel to be part of our cases cause it has a long lifecycle and it's recyclable! Last but not least, for packaging, we work with recycled cardboard.</p><p>We hand-craft each unit as the masterpiece they are in our lab, located in Madrid (Spain). We have total control over the design and manufacturing processes. So (1) we make decisions towards energy consumption optimization, (2) make the most out of our resources, (3) enhance recycling, and (4) give steps towards a zero-waste product.  Whenever possible, we collaborate with local suppliers to reduce our carbon footprint and especially with those who share our philosophy and take care of the environment, too. A great example of this is the laser cutting supplier we work with, which sources itself with just renewable energy!</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://tierra.audio/es/flavours-preamps-es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">¿HABLAS ESPAÑOL?

AQUÍ TIENES LA CAMPAÑA TRADUCIDA  Flavours Preamps is a collection of studio-quality microphone inline analog preamplifiers that will bring an extra dose of gain, texture and colour to your vocals and instrument recordings, and live performances. Simply plug in your favourite microphone and start singing or playing your instrument: You'll be amazed at your ""new sound""!Thanks to the wide range of flavours offered, you can enjoy different gain levels, from an enhanced and crystalline sound to different types and intensities of ""sonic flavours"" specially designed to bring a unique character, always without losing a drop of musicality. You will get warmer nuances and sounds, others sharper or hotter, others denser, others more saturated, others with more definition, more grain, or even more crunchy. Like all our products, the Flavours Preamps are handmade with tons of love in Madrid (Spain), with circuits and electronic components of the highest quality.These products result from the joint effort of engineers, musicians, designers, and producers to provide a full range of ""portable flavours"" that will enrich and nuance the sound of your microphones.Each of these seven microphone preamplifiers works thanks to the phantom power (48V) of your audio interface or your mixing console, returning the boosted signal from your microphone. This will improve the ability of your audio interface to pick up and manipulate the sound with the highest quality, solving some of the noise problems you may be experiencing with your microphone, and allowing you to use longer cables and providing an extra dose of colour depending on the flavour you have chosen.Your creativity will rule as you record voices and instruments of all kinds! Put them in the backpack, keep them in the guitar case, purse, or the car's glove box.They are ultra-compact and don't need batteries or additional power cables, so you can use them comfortably not only at home or in the recording studio but also in the rehearsal room, in your live concerts, in your streaming and videoconference sessions, or working on your productions all over the city, or while traveling or on vacation. We have designed seven different flavours, offering a very versatile sound range to help you improve the sound of your lead voices, choirs, Spanish guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitar, bass amplifiers, and all kinds of string instruments such as violins, cellos or double basses, percussion instruments... In short, any voice or instrument that can be picked up by a microphone.Each of the models offers a different gain level (all boosted), as well as a possible frequency filter (more or less bass, mid and/or treble) and a certain harmonic distortion (soft or hard), or even an improved but totally neutral sound, without additives.All perks will have a 50% discount until January 10th, a 40% discount until January 24th, and a 30% discount from then until the end of the campaign.Flavours Preamps are: Truffle, Cocoa, Mint, Chilli, Vanilla, Pepper and Salt.

 When the flavour you already have in a dish is 100% what you are looking for, but you would like to enhance it, what do you use? A pinch of salt, exactly!Salt is our most neutral and transparent flavour, that is, without adding a speck of flavour, colour, or distortion to your sound.This preamp is perfect for use with your dynamic microphone without adding colour, or your favorite passive ribbon microphones, protecting them from the possible adverse effects of phantom power and preserving all the original nuances while amplifying the weak signal usually generated by this type of mics so that you have no noise at the input of your audio interface when trying to compensate for that low signal.FOR AUDIO GEEKS:
BOOSTED GAIN: +39 dB.

 Flavours Preamps are specially designed for safe use with dynamic and passive ribbon microphones, as they are the microphones that usually generate the smaller signal and need the biggest sound boost. For example:Shure SM7B, Shure Beta 58A, Shure SM57, Shure SM58, ElectroVoice RE20, Beyerdynamic M69N, M130, M160, AEA R84, Coles 4038, Royer Labs Passive Ribbon Microphones, SE Electronics VR1 Voodoo, t.bone passive ribbon microphones, and others. We guarantee that the phantom power will never reach the microphone.If you want to use the Flavours Preamps with condenser microphones or with active (phantom-powered) ribbon microphones, you will have to use an external phantom power source to feed your microphone.By the way, USB microphones cannot be connected to the Flavours Preamps, only microphones connected via balanced audio cables with XLR connectors (male-female).The output of Flavours Preamps is a boosted balanced microphone signal (output is not a line signal). The seven ""sonic flavours"" we propose are born by passing the signal from your microphone through different 100% analog electronic circuits that transform it in the entire frequency spectrum. Just like when you look for a specific flavour while cooking your favorite dish, depending on the sound you want to obtain, these circuits are formed by different ingredients (electronic components of the highest quality), with which we build filters and amplification stages that fulfill very specialized tasks.Also, five of our Flavours Preamps incorporate a crucial ingredient: a premium input transformer.The transformer amplifies the signal by passing it through a copper winding around a metal core that excites the signal and gives it an extra dose of harmonics: pure colour and tasty sound. Choosing a transformer is not an easy task. There are hundreds and hundreds of manufacturers, models, and features to try until you find the one which best fits the purpose, the flavour we are looking for.Thanks to our extensive experience in the world of ProAudio, we know and work with the best international brands of transformers. Therefore, we have selected models of prestigious brands such as Carnhill® (UK) and Lundahl® (Sweeden).Each of the selected transformers is specially designed to provide even or odd harmonics to your sound, more or less saturation, amplification, colour, and even noise, and all in an incredibly musical way! We need your support!Now, we need your support to refine the prototype of each model.On the one hand, expanding and improving the electronics so that each Flavour Preamp is much more evident and different, but also so that the exterior finish of the chassis is totally professional, for example with a more durable paint.In addition, we have thought of a minimalist and ecological packaging design that allows you to take your Flavour Preamp anywhere in complete safety, without using plastic, but rather recycled and recyclable materials.Thank you very much for supporting us and for sharing this campaign with your friends!  Rewards will begin to be sent around February 15, 2021, in order of contribution.*** Due to the heavy snow storm that has kept Madrid isolated for several days, the logistics agencies of our suppliers have not functioned normally, so we may suffer an extraordinary delay of between 7 and 10 days. We apologise for the inconvenience.   For GEARNEWS.com, TIERRA Audio is on the list of The Best Studio Gear of 2020: Top 10 Compressors, Preamps, Mixers and Effects!  Important things about ecologyWe design our gear following Quality by Design principles to last for decades of daily use. We always want to reduce he internal wiring, minimizing mechanical contacts and hugely shortening the analog audio paths. Our PCBs will facilitate many maintenance processes and will be more efficient and green than never. Electrical isolation will also be much better against high-frequency interferences and we’ll also improve heat dissipation from the power supply units. We only work with first-class brands on the market and materials of the highest quality. By making the case and knobs in steel, we ensure the highest durability, lightness, corrosion resistance and thermal insulation.We prioritize the use of recycled or recyclable materials. Most of them can be reused without losing any of their properties. By creating this circular supply chain, we reduce the need for virgin materials being mined from the earth and give them a second chance to get into the market. And it goes without saying that we follow WEEE regulations!  Also, we have designed our packaging not only to be the best bodyguard our gear may have ever dreamt of, but also to be one element that can be reused.It is our mission to use as little plastic as possible and minimize virgin elements usage.  When starting a new design, our top priority is choosing the right materials. We make sure every single component is RoHS compliant. Substances such as lead, mercury, or cadmium (among others) are totally out of the game for being dangerous to the environment and pollute landfills.  We look at lifespan and recyclability, too; that's why we decided steel to be part of our cases cause it has a long lifecycle and it's recyclable! Last but not least, for packaging, we work with recycled cardboard.We hand-craft each unit as the masterpiece they are in our lab, located in Madrid (Spain). We have total control over the design and manufacturing processes. So (1) we make decisions towards energy consumption optimization, (2) make the most out of our resources, (3) enhance recycling, and (4) give steps towards a zero-waste product.  Whenever possible, we collaborate with local suppliers to reduce our carbon footprint and especially with those who share our philosophy and take care of the environment, too. A great example of this is the laser cutting supplier we work with, which sources itself with just renewable energy!  ¿HABLAS ESPAÑOL? AQUÍ TIENES LA CAMPAÑA TRADUCIDA",31.0,1,"1 Campaign

Weight & Shape Comparison
The weight of Lytte HarmoniQ (6g/earphone) is very similar to the AirPods Pro (~5.6g/earphone). However, Lytte HarmoniQ s shape has been designed to make use of your outer ear‘s natural shape for a better seal and noise isolation, instead of storing its hardware in a stick that drops down below your ear. like the AirPods seen below.

Sound Resolution


The Lytte HarmoniQ distortion is very low and virtually undetectable. Better than Sennheiser and B&O.
A low THD means the output audio signal has low distortion compared to the input, so the audio signal is as close to the original sound as possible.

Not only has this never been done before in VST/AU software form having 19 high-end plugins all rolled into one slick interface for a fast and convenient intuitive workflow, Vocalator Pro’s ‘one-click radio ready’ presets will save you and other mix engineers, producers, vocalists, live performers, podcasters & voice over artists around the world HOURS of painstaking tweaking usually needed in every session, giving you back more valuable time to keep the creative flow going and focus on the rest of the mix, while at the same time giving vocalists full confidence in their sound while recording helping to capture the very best performance both in the studio and live. 
 


 
Choose from the organised library of presets to make professional vocals suited to any genre of music or voice style as well as cool experimental effects, and fun sci-fi & robot voices.

Its independently-developed OrionStar Speech OS technology has been applied to many big companies in the industry and hence becoming the""most extensively used ""Al speech system.Orion aims to build the next era of technology products, to change people's life by making more intelligent, more efficient and better products. Our mission is to improve people's lives by using technology in a world where humans and machines coexist. We created ChetahTALK Plus to make communication easier and convenient for everyone. We hope that our product will help bridge language barriers and start more meaningful conversations around the world.  This crowdfunding project is marketed by Red Cube. Since 2015, Red Cube has helped companies of all sizes bring their ideas into fruition, raising over $100MM through crowdfunding.   Last year, we took on this challenge of introducing our CheetahTALK translator to the masses on Indiegogo. It was a successful campaign that raised over $58K, and now we're excited and ready to do it again with our latest product, CheetahTALK Plus.Steps for a fast and safe deliveryWe'll be working with top-class couriers to offer reliable and fast delivery. We'll also be taking the necessary steps to protect our incredible fulfillment team's health and safety during this COVID reality. Our Cheetah Mobile service team is in place to personally handle every backer's questions and make sure all backers can receive their orders without any issues.Steps we're taking:
Distribution centers taking extensive precautions to ensure the safety of its workers. 
Providing team members with high-quality face masks and gloves to wear at work.
Encouraging healthy hygiene habits as guided by the CDC.
We're on track for safe deliveryTiming can be a big challenge to the production and shipment of a new product during these times. But thanks to proper planning and safety measures, COVID-19 has had zero effect on our timeline. We're fully committed to delivering our products on time while keeping you informed of our progress throughout this campaign.We don't foresee any issues currently; however, if anything unexpected happens by chance, we promise to keep you informed, both during the campaign and afterward.",62.0,9,"1 Campaign

Here is what some music professionals mentioned about SoundFlux™:

 


Another masterpiece from our industrial design team who have won several awards over the years, to name a few: the iF Award, Red Dot Award and IDEA Award. SoundFlux will not disappoint you with its high-end look and finish, which separate itself from a numbers of plastic toy-alike competitors.



Our Dual-Driver True Wireless Stereo Headphones provide a much wider dynamic range than most single driver headphones currently available on the market. The two professional quality 6mm dynamic drivers work in unison with noise cancellation technology to cover a wide range while offering a clear and pure sound experience.
 

Dual Driver
One focuses on creating a solid foundation - bass
The other focuses on keeping the high end accurate and clear, mid and highs - treble


Professional Audio DSP
Lossless Codec
Dual-Driver Ambient Noise Cancellation
Software Optimization


Regular headphones have a limited range of frequency response since their single driver can only cover part of a human's hearing range. They either perform average in both bass range and treble range, or are tuned to cover one and leave the other poorly compromised. 

Powered by a dual driver audio system, SoundFlux™ covers both bass range and treble range naturally with the two professional grade drivers.

 

Adjust EQ from headphone
Three preset EQ settings to choose from:

Naturally Balanced
Vocal
Enhanced Bass



SoundPass™ Mode, when enabled, allows you to be aware of your surroundings and engage with the environment without pausing your music.


A simple triple-press of the multi-function button will activate SoundPass™ mode, and you can talk to people without pausing music.

And yield traffic while jogging.

And, if permitted, notice traffic while driving.

Check out Chris Patterson's reaction when he was testing the impressive SoundPass™ Mode!
 
SoundPass™ Mode in action
Have conversations while listening to your music and be aware of your surroundings.
 

Unlike most true wireless earbuds in the market which only support mono talk, using the latest Bluetooth chipset, SoundFlux™ supports stereo phone use.
Crystal clear sound quality and stereo phone calls make SoundFlux™ not only pleasant for music, but also for voice chatting.


SoundFlux™ offers its users full control on music and phone calls. From the headphone, you can pause/resume music play, tune up or tune down the volume, skip to the last song or the next song.




The ultimate in-ear comfort, silicone ear tips mold to the unique contours of any ear to provide a better fit and seal.

3 Different Sizes - S, M, L
Included are three different sized earhooks for additional security if needed


 
Thanks for the ergonomic design, even without any ear hook, SoundFlux™ provides a more secure fit than most sports headphones.
 
Not feeling comfortable wearing ear hooks? No problem - You don't need any!
 

So light that you barely feel them in your ear

Seamless One Time Setup!
Quick one time initial setup for automatic pairing when taken out of case and automatic disconnect when you're done.


Pair SoundFlux™ to your device once and it will automatically pair every time you take them out of the charging case
SoundFlux™ will automatically disconnect from your device and turn off when placed back in the charging case



SoundFlux™ is equipped with a high-sensitivity antenna which guarantees stable Bluetooth Connectivity when on the move!

Stay focused and in the zone without having to worry about interruptions with your music!

Perfect for any outdoor activity and movement on the go!



SoundFlux™ headphones have a nanotech coating that offers protection from accidental damages as well as sweat or rain - perfect for outdoor activities!

Offers protection from a powerful water jet (12.5mm spray of water at 100 liters per minute) in any direction for at least 3 minutes
Also offers a dust free protection





Powered by Bluetooth 5 Low Energy Technology, SoundFlux™ provides

Up to 4.5 hours* of music play and phone use without case charging

</h3></div>","As simple as taking them out of their charging box.In terms of software, we opted for simplicity. It should be easy and painless to use your TWS earbuds. Pairing can be done with 3 simple steps, and once connected, the S2 will automatically reconnect to your device whenever you pick it up. And with our intuitive controls, you won’t have to think twice about whether to play the next track or answer the call.  KZ Acoustics started as a brand by enthusiasts for enthusiasts and has 10 years of experience in the development and production of HiFi In-Ear Monitors. Our products have been featured, reviewed and recommended in popular websites and have been recognized by experts in the audio field.   Our acoustic engineering team has developed a new 7mm double magnetic dynamic driver that utilizes an additional magnet to exponentially increase the responsiveness and output power of the diaphragm. This new breakthrough takes the notion of dynamic drivers to a whole new level. An all-new powerful dynamic driver housed in the form factor of a TWS. It’s mobile music like never before.  Dual Coil Dynamic Driver. Designed for PowerWith an enhanced voice-coil design and a new polymer-polymer diaphragm membrane, our new dynamic driver is able to focus on delivering a more impactful sound with lower total harmonic distortion - ultimately, meaning a more high-resolution sound. Our new dynamic driver has been meticulously crossed over with our custom proprietary KZ 30095 ultra-high frequency balanced armature driver. Balanced armature drivers are renowned in the field of profession in-ear monitors due to their amazing speed and accuracy. Customized 30095 ultra-high frequency balanced armature driver.The 30095 is especially prized due to its ability to effectively extend the treble and its low total harmonic distortion output. Our team has utilized this driver to create a detailed, smooth, and airy high-frequency response that is crystal clear and transparent. In combination, this hybrid dual-driver configuration makes for a musical sound that features hard-hitting bass, full bodied and rich mids, and detailed and engaging trebles. The KZ S2 is ready to unleash the full potential of your music. AAC Support for HQ AudioBuilt-in with the Realtek chip, the S2 true wireless earbuds support AAC to achieve HQ sound quality and seamless transmission. Not only has your music never sounded this good before, but now you can enjoy your movies and games with sync rivaling even wired earphones. Why AAC over APTX?The AAC codec is currently more widely implemented throughout online streaming sources, as it's the codec of choice when encoding videos for Youtube, Twitch, and many other online platforms including music apps like Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music, Pandora, and Tidal. AAC is also the default Bluetooth codec for many popular mobile devices, including the entire line-up of Apple products, which do not offer APTX support.By using AAC we aimed to improve compatibility, sound quality, and most importantly, reduction in latency. With AAC you will enjoy some of the fastest Bluetooth experience with some of the lowest latency rates. It will be like you are using wired earphones. CVC Noise Isolating MicrophoneThe CVC Noise Cancellation Technology, combined with the S2 silicon microphone work cohesively together to optimize your calls by drowning out background noise. You shouldn’t be the only one who gets to enjoy crystal clear audio! Modern Bluetooth 5.0 Technology and High Performance ModeWith Bluetooth 5.0, pairing with any of your devices is quick and easy!

Malektronic ® is committed to designing portable sound systems for music lovers with the highest standards of production. We love music and our goal is to offer products with excellent quality that can compete with the most popular devices, but at an affordable price. A few quick facts about us:

Malektronic has been actively making and marketing wireless audio solutions for over 5 years.
Malektronic is based out of Tampa, Florida USA.
We are family owned and operated. 
Malektronic wants to enable the power of the social world to grow our brand and products with the pride and power of you.

You may recognize our name from the news coverage of our spokesperson The Malektronic Rocketman who gained popularity by cheering on the home hockey team here in Tampa Florida.
Malektronic wants to be the go-to brand of wireless audio based on quality and sound. We want to be the brand that is not over charging you for a ""name"" or to pay celebrities to use us. Malektronic wants to continue to develop our brand based on loyalty to the product and not the celebrity advertising campaigns. 
 

Why Interstellar Funding
We have been super excited about these new headphones. The prototypes have performed excellently. However we need  your help to complete the process and rocket these headphones into the spotlight. 
Emerging brands and small business like Malektronic need your help, and we believe we have come up with a product that performs amazing and will grow in popularity with your support.   

Interstellar headphones will be something you can brag about because of your support.
Your support will allow us to complete the prototype stage and start manufacturing.
You can help us with funding, or by spreading the word on Malektronic.

Additionally we are working to review possible upgraded features and might need to incorporate them into the final prototype before manufacturing commences. Some items being reviewed for possible inclusion into the final headphone design include but not limited to the following: 

Hybrid feed forward and feedback Digital Noise Cancelling solution to further enhance the ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) capability to meet similar abilities of other popular advanced brands / products on the market. 
High Definition drivers to enhance sound reproduction and sound perception.

<p>The founders of Comhear Inc. envision a future where immersive, 3D audio can be delivered without multiple speakers or headphones. They reached out to a Peter Otto, Director of Sonic Arts R&amp;D at the Qualcomm Institute at UCSD, and initiated a series of research projects into beam forming and spatial audio realization. The results of those projects resulted in several patents and products — AND Peter leaving his directorship after 25 years to join Comhear in July of 2016 as the company's Chief Science Officer.</p>

<p>Our goal is to reimagine immersive, 3D audio using innovative cutting edge technologies. We've made incredible progress towards this ambitious goal but we need your help in bringing our patented technology to you.</p>
<p><strong>TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING COSTS</strong></p>
<p>The research has been done, concepts validated, working prototypes assembled and  tested, and now we simply need to ramp up manufacturing. We've secured strong relationships and know the costs needed to produce tooling, purchase materials, manufacture units, and distribute the YARRA 3DX smart bar to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>BRINGING INNOVATION TO THE FUTURE OF IMMERSIVE SOUND</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why are the shipping costs to international destinations so high?</strong></p>
<p>The YARRA 3DX sound bars and subwoofers are being manufactured in China. The current plans include shipping several containers to our fulfillment center in Poway, California. All units will be then shipped to backers around the world.</p>
<p>As a small startup company, we haven't yet established regional hubs in different countries to help reduce shipping costs and taxation of imported goods. We're researching alternatives but the present plan uses USPS International Mail to deliver units around the world.</p>
<p>The initial costs estimates from FEDEX, DHL, and UPS were almost double the costs included on the current rewards. We had hoped that the ""lower"" costs would be acceptable.</p>
<p>The alternative would be to restrict the YARRA 3DX product to domestic sales only. We decided to offer this amazing technology knowing that the costs for shipping would be higher than preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Can the YARRA 3DX unit be wall mounted and easily removed, if necessary?</strong></p>
<p>The rear of the YARRA 3DX enclosure has standard mounting holes for a wall mounting bracket. However, given the necessity to connect power, sources (HDMI), and the subwoofer to the back, moving it to another room would be less than convenient. We suggest that you secure a second unit for the additional space.</p>
<p><strong>Does the YARRA 3DX come with a dedicated physical remote control?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It is possible to turn the unit on and off, adjust the volume, and configure the sound field to near or far using the remote.</p>
<p><strong>Are import taxes or VAT included in the price of the unit or shipping costs?</strong></p>
<p>No. Taxes and VAT are the responsibility of each individual backer.</p>
<p><strong>Are there physical control buttoms on the YARRA 3DX unit?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The industrial design incorporates the volume, power, and mode adjustment controls in the 4-part end panels.</p>
<p><strong>Does the YARRA 3DX support APT X HD?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use my own subwoofer with the YARRA 3DX?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can. The speaker array includes a 3.5 mono jack, which supplies, unbalanced, line level audio for the sub. As long as you have the right connections and configuration, you can upgrade to a bigger sub.</p>
<p>However, we've found that the included sub does a very reasonable job and extends down to 40 Hz. It includes a 30 watt amplifier.</p>
<p><strong>What are the dimensions of the subwoofer?</strong></p>
<p>The YARRA 3DX subwoofer contains a 5.25"" driver in a ported box measuring 8"" x 8"" x 10 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to support additional codecs like DTS:X or Dolby Atmos?</strong></p>
<p>We're looking into the cost of licensing and including additional codecs in future releases.</p>
<p><strong>Which version of Bluetooth will the YARRA 3DX support?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, we're using 4.2 but plan to support the latest version.</p>
<p><strong>Does the YARRA 3DX has a TOSLink optical input?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Will the appropriate power connectors and voltage be supported for international orders?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What happens if I have more than 3 people listening to the immersive surround projections? What do the others hear?</strong></p>
<p>The 3 primary listeners will hear immersive surround and any other will hear enhanced stereo.</p></figure></div><p> </p></div>","THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED 3D AUDIO PLATFORMPerfect for gaming, music, & home cinema!YARRA 3DX is the world's first 3D audio sound bar that delivers the same immersive entertainment experience as multiple speaker home theaters and 3D audio headphones. This small ""smart"" sound bar makes you feel like you're sitting in a high-end theater by delivering discrete left and right ""beams"" of binaural 3D audio to up to three individual areas in your room!Hear every detail as if you were immersed what you are watching!""Today I've had the opportunity to experience the demo of the product we are all eagerly waiting for. I was speechless. The sound coming out of this bar is mind blowing!I am not associated with the company, but frankly speaking, for this amount of money (and yes, even the shipping cost outside US) you cannot, and let me repeat, you cannot get anything better on the market. I was literally blown away, smiled like an idiot for more than an hour. The sound was coming from everywhere! When you close your eyes, you don't have the feeling that you are in a room anymore. You think you are in the middle of a movie, a game or in a perfect concert hall.Absolutely stunning! IMAX quality sound system in your apartment and I am not kidding! I cannot praise the team enough for their communication. This project should serve as a pilot project for a Kickstarter for all the future creators out there. Peter, thank you so much for today's presentation. I could write another few lines about my excitement, but you will all experience it next year. This is just crazy!"" Grega Petek“Met Mark and Peter and they were gracious enough to let my two friends and me sit in the studio while they did the live stream. I’m already a backer, and now the two friends I brought are backers as well. We were able, after the live stream, to sit down and listen to a near field example of beam forming. Absolute magic. The ability to create a wrap around sound stage is absolutely stunning. I signed up because I thought this would be a nice upgrade to my TV sound bar. I left thinking this may well replace my high end audio speakers as well. I walked away comfortable in the knowledge that these guys are exactly who they say they are, and the product does everything they say it will do. I’m very excited to take delivery early next year.” Pierre 

Men's Journal: ""This soundbar uses an ingenious, uncanny, and game-changing digital sound field modeling technique it calls MyBeam to pinpointedly blast everything from stereo to 7.1 surround sound directly to your ear, as well as the same optimized effect to up to two other listeners in other parts of the room."" Tom Samiljan of Men's Journal included the YARRA 3DX in his list of Top Ten cool gadgets and electronics at the show. He wrote,Engadget: ""I had a brief experience with some demo material before the Showstoppers event became too crowded, and came away impressed. Comhear's claim is that it can deliver a headphone-like localized sound experience and it truly delivered, even in a room not suited to high-quality audio."" Richard LawlerTNW: “It sounded really good, and more importantly, the surround effect worked really well. I could hear bullets whizzing past my head in a gaming demo, or pinpoint exactly where sounds were coming form in a popular audio clip.”The Absolute Sound: “I was impressed and intrigued by the ambient and immersive environment this little bar created.”Audioholics: “The YARRA 3DX sound bar was able to focus three discrete audio programs to three specific areas of the room. There was no ""crosstalk"" or bleed. I was amazed.”  Each YARRA 3DX comes with a powerful subwoofer to support bass frequencies present in movies soundtracks, hi-fi music, games, and VR experiences. The wired YARRA 3DX subwoofer has a 5.25"" driver and 30 Watt amplifier that outputs deep bass from 50 - 100 Hz.

YARRA 3DX as a consumer project was initiated in late summer of 2014. The research done at the Spatial Audio Lab at UC San Diego under the direction of CSO and faculty member Peter Otto, resulted in our first sound bar — the ProAV model.
Research

 

Industrial Design


Prototype Testing


 

The industrial design of the YARRA 3DX system was developed over many months after extensive research and market surveys. Tandem Design — a Santa Monica-based design firm with years of experience with sound bars — provided the YARRA 3DX team dozens of potential designs, revised countless details, and produced working prototypes in both black and silver. 


 
Multicoloured Lights
The YARRA 3DX has a  row of LED lights along the bottom edge that can be switched on or off. Gamers will undoubtedly appreciate the ability to customize the look and feel of their YARRA 3DX system.

End Stands
Another detail desktop users will appreciate are the adjustable ""end stands"". These can be used to elevate the main YARRA 3DX unit above the base of a computer monitor or display.

Wall Mountable
The YARRA 3DX main array has standard mounting holes located on the rear of the unit, which can be used to easily and safely attach the sound bar to a wall.




The founders of Comhear Inc. envision a future where immersive, 3D audio can be delivered without multiple speakers or headphones. They reached out to a Peter Otto, Director of Sonic Arts R&D at the Qualcomm Institute at UCSD, and initiated a series of research projects into beam forming and spatial audio realization. The results of those projects resulted in several patents and products — AND Peter leaving his directorship after 25 years to join Comhear in July of 2016 as the company's Chief Science Officer.



 
The YARRA 3DX sound projector product & campaign was conceived and developed in 2016 with the assistance of Peter's college friend Mark Waldrep, PhD,  award-winning audio engineer, audiophile, record producer, and founder of AIX Records, under the guidance of Comhear senior management.


 


 

Our goal is to reimagine immersive, 3D audio using innovative cutting edge technologies. We've made incredible progress towards this ambitious goal but we need your help in bringing our patented technology to you.
TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING COSTS
The research has been done, concepts validated, working prototypes assembled and  tested, and now we simply need to ramp up manufacturing. We've secured strong relationships and know the costs needed to produce tooling, purchase materials, manufacture units, and distribute the YARRA 3DX smart bar to consumers.
BRINGING INNOVATION TO THE FUTURE OF IMMERSIVE SOUND
We know that building a state-of-the-art audio product is worthwhile and potentially disruptive to an industry anxious for change, but we want our efforts to inform and alter the consumer audio marketplace.











Why are the shipping costs to international destinations so high?
The YARRA 3DX sound bars and subwoofers are being manufactured in China. The current plans include shipping several containers to our fulfillment center in Poway, California. All units will be then shipped to backers around the world.
As a small startup company, we haven't yet established regional hubs in different countries to help reduce shipping costs and taxation of imported goods. We're researching alternatives but the present plan uses USPS International Mail to deliver units around the world.
The initial costs estimates from FEDEX, DHL, and UPS were almost double the costs included on the current rewards. We had hoped that the ""lower"" costs would be acceptable.
The alternative would be to restrict the YARRA 3DX product to domestic sales only. We decided to offer this amazing technology knowing that the costs for shipping would be higher than preferred.
Can the YARRA 3DX unit be wall mounted and easily removed, if necessary?
The rear of the YARRA 3DX enclosure has standard mounting holes for a wall mounting bracket. However, given the necessity to connect power, sources (HDMI), and the subwoofer to the back, moving it to another room would be less than convenient. We suggest that you secure a second unit for the additional space.
Does the YARRA 3DX come with a dedicated physical remote control?
Yes. It is possible to turn the unit on and off, adjust the volume, and configure the sound field to near or far using the remote.
Are import taxes or VAT included in the price of the unit or shipping costs?
No. Taxes and VAT are the responsibility of each individual backer.
Are there physical control buttoms on the YARRA 3DX unit?
Yes. The industrial design incorporates the volume, power, and mode adjustment controls in the 4-part end panels.
Does the YARRA 3DX support APT X HD?
Yes.
Can I use my own subwoofer with the YARRA 3DX?
Yes, you can. The speaker array includes a 3.5 mono jack, which supplies, unbalanced, line level audio for the sub. As long as you have the right connections and configuration, you can upgrade to a bigger sub.
However, we've found that the included sub does a very reasonable job and extends down to 40 Hz. It includes a 30 watt amplifier.
What are the dimensions of the subwoofer?
The YARRA 3DX subwoofer contains a 5.25"" driver in a ported box measuring 8"" x 8"" x 10 inches.
Are there plans to support additional codecs like DTS:X or Dolby Atmos?
We're looking into the cost of licensing and including additional codecs in future releases.
Which version of Bluetooth will the YARRA 3DX support?
Currently, we're using 4.2 but plan to support the latest version.
Does the YARRA 3DX has a TOSLink optical input?
Yes.
Will the appropriate power connectors and voltage be supported for international orders?
Yes, the YARRA 3DX system works with 120/240 volts and will come with the correct connector type.
What happens if I have more than 3 people listening to the immersive surround projections? What do the others hear?
The 3 primary listeners will hear immersive surround and any other will hear enhanced stereo.",51.0,7,"1 Campaign

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Flare's patent-pending ISOLATE® Technology</b></p>
<p>Flare's founder and inventor, Davies Roberts, could not understand why traditional ear plugs were so bad at doing their job. When he looked into it, he realised that ear protection was taking the wrong path in using plastic, silicone and foam to absorb sound.</p>
<p>“Imagine wearing a helmet all the way over your head made of plastic or foam. What would you hear? The sound level would be reduced but the effect of the plastic resonating and foam muffling the sound would not be so nice to listen to. Both these materials do stop <i><span>some</span></i> sound but, frankly, are not that great at it, especially at lower frequencies. When low frequencies get past traditional ear protection, details get lost and you're left in a world of booming bass and sub-sonic pressure which you can't wait to escape from. No noise cancelling electronics can deal with this muffled sound that comes from the plastic and foam parts of such devices.</p>
<p>But imagine putting your head all the way into an inch-thick, solid titanium helmet encased in foam. Now what would you hear?</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">... Exactly!  That’s just what I thought.""</p>
<p>Solid metal is a good conductor and so had been discounted as unsuitable for use in ear protectors. Until now. What Davies has discovered is that, in order to conduct sound, metals need a direct connection. Without a direct connection solid metals block sound perfectly!</p>
<p>""When you isolate a small piece of metal or dense material in soft foam inside your ear, sound waves can't penetrate from the flexible medium of air and it becomes the perfect isolator. Understanding this principle is what inspired us to develop the perfect ear plug. We want to revolutionise hearing protection!""</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Block Low Frequencies</b></p>
<p>Traditional ear plugs and defenders cannot block low frequencies from entering your ears very well. As well as being unpleasant to listen to, they make sound muffled, leaving you feeling disconnected, or as if you are underwater. Low frequencies produce the most energy, and this is not absorbed properly by the plastic or foam used in traditional ear plugs.</p>
<div>
<b>ISOLATE®</b> has been tested in-house against a typical foam earplug using a direct sound source, this measured the attenuation level achieved by the different materials.<p> </p>
<p>The red trace below is the source signal which was a headphone unit, the pink trace is a standard foam earplug, the green trace is <b>ISOLATE®</b> (aluminium) and the blue trace is <b>ISOLATE® PRO</b> (titanium). Each vertical division on the chart represents -10dB of sound attenuation.</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see by the data below both <b>ISOLATE®</b> versions totally out-perform the traditional foam earplug. <b>ISOLATE® Pro Titanium has an additional 8-9dB (more than four times the attenuation) with the lowest frequencies, which is crucial for blocking out the most irritating snoring, high impact sounds and enabling you to hear more detail in music.</b></p>

<p><b>A good design will stand the test of time.</b></p>
<p>Good design is not just about achieving a good technical result, it's also about great visual identity. Modern industrial design is Davies's passion; clean lines and symmetrical shapes which never date. This is demonstrated in the design of <b>ISOLATE®</b> with perfect form and optimal functionality to create a pleasing visual simplicity.</p>
<p><b>ISOLATE®</b> has also been designed to last forever. The tips, which can be size-selected for best fit, are replaceable when they get damaged or wear out, but you will never need to replace the <b>ISOLATE®</b> metal component.</p>
<p><b>ISOLATE®</b> has ridges on the tip connector that allows the tip to lock into place. To remove a tip, squeeze the tip and twist and pull the body. To put on a new one, simply push it into place with a satisfying click.</p>
<p>The tips used with <b>ISOLATE®</b> are called <b>EARFOAMS®</b>. They are very easy to fit and come in small, medium and large sizes to ensure <b>ISOLATE®</b> will fit the majority of people. A set of each size is included with each <b>ISOLATE®</b> pair.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Ears ringing? That's the sound of damage.</b></p>
<p>If you enjoy concerts, gigs and music as much as we do, then you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Ringing in the ears and cotton wool hearing in the morning are the result of hearing damage. </p>
<p>Conventional plastic or foam earplugs don't work very well. They are fiddly, uncool and no fun to wear, especially at concerts and gigs because they make music sound muffled and you feel disconnected, or like you are underwater.</p>
<p>Using <b>ISOLATE®</b> ear protectors, you still hear the music, but only through bone conduction which is safer and a much nicer experience than the muffled rumble you get with traditional ear plugs.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;font-weight: bold;""><b>Sonic Forcefield</b></p>
<p>To use <b>ISOLATE®</b> is to feel like you are inside a sonic force field of protection. You hear more detail in music as the peaks of sound that normally stress your hearing have been brought down to a calm, enjoyable and balanced level. Even whistles and screams around you blend into the music rather than ripping into your ears. You are in your own safe world, but as you can still hear every detail from bone-conducted sound, and feel all the bass in your body, you get all of the pleasure and none of the pain of the experience.</p>
<p>This sonic forcefield can protect you anywhere you want to block out irritating sounds such as...</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How it all began</b></p>
<p>For as long as he can remember, Flare’s founder Davies Roberts has been fascinated by all things sound and noise related. </p>
<p>Whether it’s working on ways to improve sound quality in loudspeakers and earphones or developing ideas in noise cancelling products, one thing has remained constant: his drive to address existing issues and to create revolutionary products that improve our experience of sound.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468498346/Flare_emblem-inverted-straight-edge_igpcdf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Block Sound... Don't try to absorb it!</b></p> <p>Traditional earplugs, particularly the standard foam ones, rely on absorption principles to attenuate sound. Trying to absorb sound in this way requires a large amount of material to work well: examining anechoic chambers demonstrates this with their foot-long spikes of foam.</p>
<p>When restricted to less than an inch of material in an ear plug, absorption is not the way to do it. Absorption on this small scale will result in muffled sound in the high and mid frequencies and little to no reduction in bass frequencies. This imbalance is stressful and tiring.</p>
<p><b>ISOLATE®</b> blocks noise from entering the ears and attenuates all frequencies. Noise is not able to conduct into the patent-pending technology that <b>ISOLATE®</b> uses which means that users are effectively able to turn off their ears to direct noise. The solid metal core of <b>ISOLATE®</b> is almost all the way through the tip which creates a sonic barrier deep inside your ear to block noise. The only sound you hear while using <b>ISOLATE®</b> is from bone conduction which results in an enjoyable and balanced experience with safe sound detail.</p>

<p>There is a wide variety of memory foam mixes that form ear tips. Getting the formulation just right is the key to a great tip! Flare has developed a special blend of memory foam to be ultra-comfortable and mould perfectly into every ear using the body's own heat. The formulation we use also has as high a resistance as possible to ripping or breaking down.</p>

 ISOLATE® is not like any other ear plug; it blocks all sound from entering your ears including bass frequencies for the first time ever without any batteries or annoying re-charging. ISOLATE® is micro in size and so can be used anywhere to isolate your ears from unwanted noise.We have developed the patent-pending technology, produced various prototypes and tested ISOLATE® in many ears (including gaining independent reviews and endorsements which are shown below). We have tested ISOLATE® out with dozens of users and on in-house test equipment which has shown staggering attenuation results.
We now need the support of crowd funding to ramp up into mass production and attract major retailers to stock ISOLATE®. By backing our crowdfunding campaign you will receive your ISOLATE® reward before online retailers commence selling the product.


Flare's patent-pending ISOLATE® Technology
Flare's founder and inventor, Davies Roberts, could not understand why traditional ear plugs were so bad at doing their job. When he looked into it, he realised that ear protection was taking the wrong path in using plastic, silicone and foam to absorb sound.
“Imagine wearing a helmet all the way over your head made of plastic or foam. What would you hear? The sound level would be reduced but the effect of the plastic resonating and foam muffling the sound would not be so nice to listen to. Both these materials do stop some sound but, frankly, are not that great at it, especially at lower frequencies. When low frequencies get past traditional ear protection, details get lost and you're left in a world of booming bass and sub-sonic pressure which you can't wait to escape from. No noise cancelling electronics can deal with this muffled sound that comes from the plastic and foam parts of such devices.
But imagine putting your head all the way into an inch-thick, solid titanium helmet encased in foam. Now what would you hear?
... Exactly!  That’s just what I thought.""
Solid metal is a good conductor and so had been discounted as unsuitable for use in ear protectors. Until now. What Davies has discovered is that, in order to conduct sound, metals need a direct connection. Without a direct connection solid metals block sound perfectly!
""When you isolate a small piece of metal or dense material in soft foam inside your ear, sound waves can't penetrate from the flexible medium of air and it becomes the perfect isolator. Understanding this principle is what inspired us to develop the perfect ear plug. We want to revolutionise hearing protection!""
 

 

Block Low Frequencies
Traditional ear plugs and defenders cannot block low frequencies from entering your ears very well. As well as being unpleasant to listen to, they make sound muffled, leaving you feeling disconnected, or as if you are underwater. Low frequencies produce the most energy, and this is not absorbed properly by the plastic or foam used in traditional ear plugs.

ISOLATE® has been tested in-house against a typical foam earplug using a direct sound source, this measured the attenuation level achieved by the different materials. 
The red trace below is the source signal which was a headphone unit, the pink trace is a standard foam earplug, the green trace is ISOLATE® (aluminium) and the blue trace is ISOLATE® PRO (titanium). Each vertical division on the chart represents -10dB of sound attenuation.

As you can see by the data below both ISOLATE® versions totally out-perform the traditional foam earplug. ISOLATE® Pro Titanium has an additional 8-9dB (more than four times the attenuation) with the lowest frequencies, which is crucial for blocking out the most irritating snoring, high impact sounds and enabling you to hear more detail in music.
 

 

ISOLATE® MiNi for a perfect night's sleep
 
ISOLATE® technology works by a revolutionary approach in the materials used. Noise is blocked by a dense material suspended in soft memory foam to isolate it from the effects of conduction. The result is total direct noise isolation for your ears for the first time ever without any electronics!

Cool Design
 

A good design will stand the test of time.
Good design is not just about achieving a good technical result, it's also about great visual identity. Modern industrial design is Davies's passion; clean lines and symmetrical shapes which never date. This is demonstrated in the design of ISOLATE® with perfect form and optimal functionality to create a pleasing visual simplicity.
ISOLATE® has also been designed to last forever. The tips, which can be size-selected for best fit, are replaceable when they get damaged or wear out, but you will never need to replace the ISOLATE® metal component.
ISOLATE® has ridges on the tip connector that allows the tip to lock into place. To remove a tip, squeeze the tip and twist and pull the body. To put on a new one, simply push it into place with a satisfying click.
The tips used with ISOLATE® are called EARFOAMS®. They are very easy to fit and come in small, medium and large sizes to ensure ISOLATE® will fit the majority of people. A set of each size is included with each ISOLATE® pair.

Ears ringing? That's the sound of damage.
If you enjoy concerts, gigs and music as much as we do, then you’ll know exactly what we’re talking about. Ringing in the ears and cotton wool hearing in the morning are the result of hearing damage. 
Conventional plastic or foam earplugs don't work very well. They are fiddly, uncool and no fun to wear, especially at concerts and gigs because they make music sound muffled and you feel disconnected, or like you are underwater.
Using ISOLATE® ear protectors, you still hear the music, but only through bone conduction which is safer and a much nicer experience than the muffled rumble you get with traditional ear plugs.
 

ISOLATE® PRO - Solid Titanium
 

Sonic Forcefield
To use ISOLATE® is to feel like you are inside a sonic force field of protection. You hear more detail in music as the peaks of sound that normally stress your hearing have been brought down to a calm, enjoyable and balanced level. Even whistles and screams around you blend into the music rather than ripping into your ears. You are in your own safe world, but as you can still hear every detail from bone-conducted sound, and feel all the bass in your body, you get all of the pleasure and none of the pain of the experience.
This sonic forcefield can protect you anywhere you want to block out irritating sounds such as...
 

Snoring
Sleeping
Plane, train, bus, car or bike noise
Noisy work environments
Motorcycling
Motorsport
Any high impact noise
Anywhere else you need isolation from unwanted noise

 

How it all began
For as long as he can remember, Flare’s founder Davies Roberts has been fascinated by all things sound and noise related. 
Whether it’s working on ways to improve sound quality in loudspeakers and earphones or developing ideas in noise cancelling products, one thing has remained constant: his drive to address existing issues and to create revolutionary products that improve our experience of sound.
 

Block Sound... Don't try to absorb it! Traditional earplugs, particularly the standard foam ones, rely on absorption principles to attenuate sound. Trying to absorb sound in this way requires a large amount of material to work well: examining anechoic chambers demonstrates this with their foot-long spikes of foam.
When restricted to less than an inch of material in an ear plug, absorption is not the way to do it. Absorption on this small scale will result in muffled sound in the high and mid frequencies and little to no reduction in bass frequencies. This imbalance is stressful and tiring.
ISOLATE® blocks noise from entering the ears and attenuates all frequencies. Noise is not able to conduct into the patent-pending technology that ISOLATE® uses which means that users are effectively able to turn off their ears to direct noise. The solid metal core of ISOLATE® is almost all the way through the tip which creates a sonic barrier deep inside your ear to block noise. The only sound you hear while using ISOLATE® is from bone conduction which results in an enjoyable and balanced experience with safe sound detail.
 

EARFOAMS®
 

EARFOAMS® come in extra small, small, medium and large sizes.

 
There is a wide variety of memory foam mixes that form ear tips. Getting the formulation just right is the key to a great tip! Flare has developed a special blend of memory foam to be ultra-comfortable and mould perfectly into every ear using the body's own heat. The formulation we use also has as high a resistance as possible to ripping or breaking down.
If our campaign is successful, EARFOAMS® replacement tip packs will be available before reward deliveries commence.
EARFOAMS® main features:

Incredibly soft with maximised 'bounce-back' memory retention
Increased resistance to ripping and breaking down
Very comfortable to use


 

The Metals
Aluminium is a great metal that is strong, lightweight and cost effective for use in ISOLATE®. It can be anodised into various colours to match your look and image. Ear protection just got cool!
Titanium is an exceptional metal and is therefore used in ISOLATE® PRO. Being harder than aluminium it maximises isolation and can stand serious abuse without breaking. Titanium inside your ear, how cool is that?
 

Aerospace Manufacturing
Flare uses a British aerospace certified supplier to manufacture the metal component of the ISOLATE® family. Milled on a robotic precision lathe, the quality, look and feel is far superior to most other mass manufacture techniques. Seeing the capabilities of our supplier along with the incredible quality of the components they produce, convinced us to use this highest standard of aerospace manufacturing.
 

Fitting Instructions - Fitting ISOLATE® is a breeze!
First select the size of tip that suits your ears. Then simply squeeze and roll the tip with your fingers to squash the memory foam down and push deep inside your ear. The end of the ISOLATE® body should sit fully within the Concha of the ear. Fitted correctly you should not hear any direct sound through your ears, you will just hear bone conducted sound!

<p>Simply, Sound4d is a speaker that gives you a sound and 4D vibration effect.</p>
<p>Why do i need sound4d speaker?</p>
<p>In general, a powerful home theater or woofer speaker is hard to enjoy their best performance at home. because of its loudness. The person who enjoy it might be appreciated but the neighbor or his family will not be happy about it.</p>
<p>Sound4D is different.</p>
<p>You can enjoy a big movie theater-like sound at your home without disturbing anyone. Game, Music, Movie. what ever you like, just enjoy it with Sound4D.</p>
<p>No need to worry about other people. You can enjoy the fully maximized sound like movie theater.</p>
<p>It feels like bring a strong vibration and acoustics from a movie theater or night club to only 1 meter radius of your body.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/414277/files/20140305193013-chair.jpg?1394076613"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Sound4D speaker separate the lower frequency sound like explosion or gun shot. </p>
<p>And the vibration unit is produced a strong vibration by playing it. And this vibration shakes user’s body and chair at the same time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/411934/files/20140305015353-works.jpg?1394013233"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>when vibration generates, the entire cushion becomes a giant springs. Furthermore, the vibration is formed a very big sound pressure and woofer base. it gives you a real surround sound and deep feeling about the space.</p>
<p>So, when you watch a war movie, you will be able to feel the bullets fly around you.</p>
<p>Also,the Sound4D gives you an ability to enjoy its grandeur sound by only yourself.</p>
<p>The secret is in the position of the speaker. </p>
<p>The nearer sound from ear can transmit a strong sound even with a low volume. Just like a headphone or earphone.</p>
<p>I means compared to general home theater, Sound4d can transmit same amount of sound with extremely low decibel.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>My name is Jungdoo Yun.  I am a Producer of the Sound4D speaker.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/411868/files/20140305011703-mypic.jpg?1394011023"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I graduated from the 'Academy of Art University' San Francisco in the United States. And then I worked as VFX artist in the Game company. My job was making a visual effect such as magic, fire, water, etc.</p>
<p>That's why I was so interested in this field. I love Movies and Games. Especially, i like all kind of special effects.</p>
<p>First time when i saw the 4D movie, it shocked me. And i thought if i can play a video games in 4D, that will shock me again. But, it wasn't happened. In fact, their was no 4D device i can use for game at home.</p>
<p>Then, I decided to make it.</p>
<p>The start was a 4D helmet.  Developing special effects like a 4D Theater, that can even enjoy at home was a goal.</p>
<p>Imagine.  If you can enjoy movies or games with 4D effects at your home. Just like a 4D theater, isn’t it really nice?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/411879/files/20140305012416-helmet.jpg?1394011456"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 4D helmet has been designed to realize wind effect, water effect, vibration effect and light effect. Just like same functions as the exclusive 4D Theater.</p>
<p>The project was successfully done.  And the functions were nicely embodied. However there was an unexpected problem. </p>
<p>It was too heavy to wear it for long hour use, even though it was lighter than your smartphone.Also, compatibility with other games or device was a problem too.</p>
<p>What I need was a machine that is simply compatible with the existing games or movies. And also, comfortable and convenient for long hours use.</p>
<p>The thing that was born by it is the Sound 4d speaker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/414278/files/20140305193042-fx500.jpg?1394076642"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Sound4D is so simple and easy to use. Just plug it to the audio output of your Game machine, TV or MP3. And Enjoy its extreme sound and vibration. </p>
<p>That's all.The beauty of sound4d is its compatibility. Playstation, Xbox360, Nintendo, computer, TV, smart phone, everything work fine.</p>
<p>And, if you have bluetooth reciever, bluetooth connect is possible. Means wireless audio connetion.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/411927/files/20140305015001-connect.jpg?1394013001"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 443px;""/></p>

<p>We made approx. 1,000 pieces of Sound4D speaker(FX-500 model). <br/>And tested a response, selling to Korean market.<br/>We got tons of feedbak and obtained marvelous outcome that the commodity satisfaction reached 100%.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/414215/files/20140305190114-feedback.jpg?1394074874"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although many customers has loved and satisfied, but the early version of Sound4D speaker was too thick. The vibration was not spread enough to whole your body. And the sound were too loud.</p>
<p>So, We decided to make more Thin and more powerful sound4d speaker that has better sound definition with even low decibel. (code naeme:FX-1200). </p>
<p>Of course the product in use of acoustic vibration is not totally new concept.</p>
<p>But we dare to speak with confidence. Let us say, any product can hardly be compared to FX-1200.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/414162/files/20140305183401-model.jpg?1394073241"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>My challenge for the personal 4D equipment is from now on. </p>
<p>I think all the functions that have been used for the 4D helmet can be mounted on Sound4D speaker.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Sound4d stand for 'Sound for Devil' or '4Dimension'.
Sound4d is a back-cushion type speaker.
Sond4d can play HIFI sound and woofer based vibration.
You don't need any extra home theater or big woofer to enjoy movie theater-like sound. Sound4d is good enough.
The newest sound4d speaker is FX-1200 which is being develop now.
Perks include all charges. (VAT and international delivery)
1 year manufacturer warranty will apply.
Is there any case not to get Perks? No way. whether the project reach its goal or not, all of you can get your perks.
Is there any place I can buy a Sound4d FX-1200 except here? No.
Do you have website?  Yes. we have e-shoppingmall. but, we haven't build english site yet. www.sound4d.com
  
 

Simply, Sound4d is a speaker that gives you a sound and 4D vibration effect.
Why do i need sound4d speaker?
In general, a powerful home theater or woofer speaker is hard to enjoy their best performance at home. because of its loudness. The person who enjoy it might be appreciated but the neighbor or his family will not be happy about it.
Sound4D is different.
You can enjoy a big movie theater-like sound at your home without disturbing anyone. Game, Music, Movie. what ever you like, just enjoy it with Sound4D.
No need to worry about other people. You can enjoy the fully maximized sound like movie theater.
It feels like bring a strong vibration and acoustics from a movie theater or night club to only 1 meter radius of your body.

 
 

Sound4D speaker separate the lower frequency sound like explosion or gun shot. 
And the vibration unit is produced a strong vibration by playing it. And this vibration shakes user’s body and chair at the same time.

when vibration generates, the entire cushion becomes a giant springs. Furthermore, the vibration is formed a very big sound pressure and woofer base. it gives you a real surround sound and deep feeling about the space.
So, when you watch a war movie, you will be able to feel the bullets fly around you.
Also,the Sound4D gives you an ability to enjoy its grandeur sound by only yourself.
The secret is in the position of the speaker. 
The nearer sound from ear can transmit a strong sound even with a low volume. Just like a headphone or earphone.
I means compared to general home theater, Sound4d can transmit same amount of sound with extremely low decibel.
 
 

Hello.
My name is Jungdoo Yun.  I am a Producer of the Sound4D speaker.

 
I graduated from the 'Academy of Art University' San Francisco in the United States. And then I worked as VFX artist in the Game company. My job was making a visual effect such as magic, fire, water, etc.
That's why I was so interested in this field. I love Movies and Games. Especially, i like all kind of special effects.
First time when i saw the 4D movie, it shocked me. And i thought if i can play a video games in 4D, that will shock me again. But, it wasn't happened. In fact, their was no 4D device i can use for game at home.
Then, I decided to make it.
The start was a 4D helmet.  Developing special effects like a 4D Theater, that can even enjoy at home was a goal.
Imagine.  If you can enjoy movies or games with 4D effects at your home. Just like a 4D theater, isn’t it really nice?
 

 
The 4D helmet has been designed to realize wind effect, water effect, vibration effect and light effect. Just like same functions as the exclusive 4D Theater.
The project was successfully done.  And the functions were nicely embodied. However there was an unexpected problem. 
It was too heavy to wear it for long hour use, even though it was lighter than your smartphone.Also, compatibility with other games or device was a problem too.
What I need was a machine that is simply compatible with the existing games or movies. And also, comfortable and convenient for long hours use.
The thing that was born by it is the Sound 4d speaker.
 

 
 

Sound4D is so simple and easy to use. Just plug it to the audio output of your Game machine, TV or MP3. And Enjoy its extreme sound and vibration. 
That's all.The beauty of sound4d is its compatibility. Playstation, Xbox360, Nintendo, computer, TV, smart phone, everything work fine.
And, if you have bluetooth reciever, bluetooth connect is possible. Means wireless audio connetion.
 
 

 

We made approx. 1,000 pieces of Sound4D speaker(FX-500 model). And tested a response, selling to Korean market.We got tons of feedbak and obtained marvelous outcome that the commodity satisfaction reached 100%.

 
Although many customers has loved and satisfied, but the early version of Sound4D speaker was too thick. The vibration was not spread enough to whole your body. And the sound were too loud.
So, We decided to make more Thin and more powerful sound4d speaker that has better sound definition with even low decibel. (code naeme:FX-1200). 
Of course the product in use of acoustic vibration is not totally new concept.
But we dare to speak with confidence. Let us say, any product can hardly be compared to FX-1200.

 

My challenge for the personal 4D equipment is from now on. 
I think all the functions that have been used for the 4D helmet can be mounted on Sound4D speaker.

Several major company are trying to make 3D device. They will give you visually virtual reality. Then we will give you another way of virtual reality.
If these two equipments are harmonized, you will be able to meet real virtual reality. that can see, hear and feel.
 
 

DLIKOREA is an autoparts company who makes rubber products for automobile.DLI established at 1978 in Korea.The major automobile companies such like Hyundai, Kia, TOYOTA, GM, and VW use our products.
 Sound4D is a new business of our company. Although our team is tiny yet. but we believe, Sound4d will be a Mega hit brand soon in the future.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">   </p>
<p>Hi, I am Steven and I come from Beijing, China. I spent most of my days in the professional sound industry. I’ve been involved in the film industry for decades, participated in the Beijing Olympic 2008 opening ceremony, as well as many on-location recording events. And I am a fan of excellent audio quality.</p>
<p>One day I tried to record a video of my son riding his bike using my smartphone, but I was unable to capture the sound of his voice clearly. That struck me, because that’s one memory I wish I had recorded right. </p>
<p> After I failed to find a commercially available product that could solve this problem, I invented a consumer-friendly gadget that can emulate the ""double system"" technique used in the film industry—meaning the video and audio are recorded and stored separately, and later synchronized and mixed on a PC.</p>
<p>A thought came to me: “Why not use a smartphone app to do auto-syncing""?</p>
<p>And that’s how it all started…</p>
<p>We are both proud and humbled to invite you to try out our new product. It has surpassed my own expectations, and is simply a lot of fun to play with!</p>
<p>We need all the support and feedback to make our product even better. Mass production requires capital and pre-sales. We will continue to conduct further R&amp;D, getting even more out of the current hardware, while keeping an eye out on the future.</p>
<p>Tell your friends if you feel GoPlay might amuse or help them too!</p>

It's a very useful gadget that provides you to record a conference or a company meeting memo.An elegant design. Subtle and universal. Match it with your favorite shirt.Auto-SyncYou don't need any knowledge of video post-production software and no need to waste your time manually adjusting the audio timing.Our timestamp mechanism will auto sync the GoPlay audio with your phone video.,Recording LimitYou can shoot unlimited takes, as long as your phone has some available storage. However, in order for the app to run smoothly on various phone platforms, there are some limited per recording:
 Audio only: 2 hours per taking
Audio and video: 15 minutes per taking
 Export All the media including audio, phone video or mixed videos can be exported to your PC or Mac for further editing. So, whatever video equipment you've grown used to (DSLR, GoPro, Drone...), you can use GoPlay as your sound resources.Text Transcript, a new coming feature:On app version 2.3.6, built-in text transcript and correction function have been implemented.( paid service with free trial)Why?Well, it is faster than regular typing (up to 400 words/minutes),with even higher transcript accuracy as the AI technology progresses.There is another great advantage. Once you convert audio into text, it will help you easily search the content from dozens of shootings.Also, share or publish it on your web page instantly.This means that you can save a lot of time on subtitle editing! Just one click and you can watch the video with subtitles in minutes!So, why not?Only leading engines in audio software are integrated for speed and accuracy: IBM  Google  iflytekIt is so powerful that you can upload large audio files to the server, the app will automatically split them into multiple smaller pieces so audio converting can be faster. How fast is the converting process?It varied on the engine, but, typically, an hour recording takes about 10 minutes to upload and complete the transcript.Supported Languages:
UK English
US English
French
Brazilian Portuguese
Mandarin Chinese
Japanese
Arabic
Spanish
Build-in correction editorAlthough the average amount of correct transcript is about  86%~95% (claimed by various engines used), you still need to do some minor correcting manually. The built-in correction editor allows you to correct words, and yet maintain the timeline information. Once finished, a subtitle is just a click away!Multi-Mic control:The release date for our professional app ver3.0 is estimated to be in August 2017, and it brings the multi mic control feature. You can use one smartphone to control up to 5 GoPlay mics simultaneously. Great for an interview with lots of guests, right?Yes, Windjammer will also be available also in August 2017.Upgrade your smartphone into a pro camera, with a clear audio recording.Try it yourself!Put one in your pocket and get ready to record some awesome audio.For more, follow the links:  ""High-end Audio Recording in a Tiny Device"" ""Change the Way you Think about Shooting iPhone video""                               How does it work?01 Bluetooth Connection02 Shooting03 WiFi Retrieval04 Mix & Share How-to & Angel users video

Hi, I am Steven and I come from Beijing, China. I spent most of my days in the professional sound industry. I’ve been involved in the film industry for decades, participated in the Beijing Olympic 2008 opening ceremony, as well as many on-location recording events. And I am a fan of excellent audio quality.
One day I tried to record a video of my son riding his bike using my smartphone, but I was unable to capture the sound of his voice clearly. That struck me, because that’s one memory I wish I had recorded right. 
 After I failed to find a commercially available product that could solve this problem, I invented a consumer-friendly gadget that can emulate the ""double system"" technique used in the film industry—meaning the video and audio are recorded and stored separately, and later synchronized and mixed on a PC.
A thought came to me: “Why not use a smartphone app to do auto-syncing""?
And that’s how it all started…
We are both proud and humbled to invite you to try out our new product. It has surpassed my own expectations, and is simply a lot of fun to play with!
We need all the support and feedback to make our product even better. Mass production requires capital and pre-sales. We will continue to conduct further R&D, getting even more out of the current hardware, while keeping an eye out on the future.
Tell your friends if you feel GoPlay might amuse or help them too!
A big thank you!

This compensates for the fact that headphones don't give you the physical punch or 'impact' that the sound waves from a room speaker have. Headphones also need to be rolled-off in the <strong>highs</strong> to compensate for the drivers being so close to the ear; a gently sloping flat line from 1kHz to about 8-10dB down at 20kHz is about right. Some small dips in the highs may actually be desirable and should exist in the 2kHz to 8kHz region.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_1390/v1543905289/g9fu297mquumwgcupkvz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The <strong>THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) </strong>of Surge Mini is <strong>lower than 1%</strong> which is one of the reason that Surge Mini produce fantastic HiFi sound and crystal-clear acoustics.

Designed to be the successor of the MP3 format, AAC achieves better sound quality than MP3 at the same bit rate.AAC is the default or standard audio format for YouTube, iPhone, iPod, iPad, iTunes, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo 3DS, DivX Plus Web Player, PlayStation 3 and various Nokia Series 40 phones. It is supported on PlayStation Vita, Wii (with the Photo Channel 1.1 update installed), Sony Walkman MP3 series and later, Android and BlackBerry.Click HERE to learn more about AAC OKon WIKIPEDIA. Advanced Double-layer Composite Film6.1mm large custom made dynamic driversEquipped with customized driver made of PEEK+PU double-layer composite polymer speaker film.  Surge Mini delivers deeper bass, clearer mids and brighter treble, much more balance even than graphene film which may have a good performance at mid and hight but worse at bass. Designed for An Incredible Audio ExperienceLike no otherHow to evaluate the Frequency Response Graph? Click HERE to learn more.  A “natural sounding” headphone should be slightly higher in the bass between 40Hz and 500Hz. This compensates for the fact that headphones don't give you the physical punch or 'impact' that the sound waves from a room speaker have. Headphones also need to be rolled-off in the highs to compensate for the drivers being so close to the ear; a gently sloping flat line from 1kHz to about 8-10dB down at 20kHz is about right. Some small dips in the highs may actually be desirable and should exist in the 2kHz to 8kHz region.The THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) of Surge Mini is lower than 1% which is one of the reason that Surge Mini produce fantastic HiFi sound and crystal-clear acoustics. The latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology provides 2.5 faster connection, which ensures incredible sound and super stable connectivity. Surge Mini vs. Other Products Surge Mini vs. Surge Pro Surge Pro, 1 Meter Immersion for up to 30 MinsIP67 Waterproof & DustproofSurge Mini-2,000mAh Charging CaseAlso Works As A Power BankThe 2,000 mAh charging case can charge the earbuds up to 24 times, provides extra 96 hours of  battery life.

<p>Carpentry is our expertise and we love working with timber. But we are also aware that forestry practices can damage the environment. So we insist on using wood such as Teak, Oak, and Walnut from large furniture. Through special wood splicing technology, we join these wood panels together to create an environmentally friendly product.</p>

What is the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? 
What is the first thing you do when you return home from a busy day at work? 
For many of us, there is only one answer: to turn on a speaker and let music flow through personal space. 


MIN7 is an elegant multi-function wooden speaker that is handcrafted and engineered to produce a pure audio and visual experience.


SEVEN FUNCTION




The market today is flooded with mass-produced products made with excessive plastic and metal parts.  We all miss the time when products embodied craftsmanship, personality, and beauty.





Carpentry is our expertise and we love working with timber. But we are also aware that forestry practices can damage the environment. So we insist on using wood such as Teak, Oak, and Walnut from large furniture. Through special wood splicing technology, we join these wood panels together to create an environmentally friendly product.





Every MIN7 is made of joined solid wood panels of 15mm thickness. Its natural tone beautifully matches your home decor. 





MIN7 embeds 2 amplifier board chips to power 150W 2.1 stereo system. In order to engineer the best sound, our speaker drivers expert with over 26 years of experience specially designed a new 1” silk dome tweeter, 4” paper cone woofer, and 5.25” subwoofer to deliver the best transition from low to high frequencies.





The unique micro-horn design of tweeters and pointed spikes on the bottom improve the overall sound performance. MIN7’s unique 3 sound chamber design reduces interference between the subwoofer and main speaker, making the sound crisp and clear.





The cones on the woofers are made of paper and wool fibers. The cone paper forming technique is between pressed cone and semi-pressed cone to achieve better sound quality. The polypropylene cone subwoofer as low distortion. It is injection-molded with rubber, which yields a high strength bond between the cone and its surroundings.





MIN7 uses a differential amplifier circuit, which has great anti-noise capability and can better suppress electromagnetic interference. It has low distortion and wider dynamic range. 





In addition, every single MIN7 is handmade and exclusively adjusted by craftsman according to each of their qualities. Our tuning expert with more than 20 years of experience ensures it has harmonically rich sound. Any note that slips away from your ear, MIN7 will help you catch it. 










MIN7 has multiple pairing options. You can easily stream music to MIN7 from your favorite devices through WiFi (AirPlay), Bluetooth, USB, optical, coaxial, and analog audio cable.










You can also use MIN7 as WiFi or Bluetooth audio receiver and connect to existing audio devices or an active subwoofer to enhance the bass performance.































In order to support up to 24bit/192kHz resolution (High-Resolution Audio), MIN7 uses:
-amplifier chips TDA7492 and TDA7498 , 300W RMS
-digital audio receiver CS8416
-digital/analog converter (DAC) system CS4398 
-low-noise dual operational amplifier JRC5532 
Its higher sampling frequency and greater bit depth boast greater detail and texture.

And with <br/>a simple and intuitive set-up, you’ll be enjoying the sound in next to no time. It has also been tested relentlessly to ensure it is robust, stable and has exceptional low latency (lip sync to you and me!) achieving latency of under 20m/s. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">It is also Damson's own proprietary wireless network and allows you to connect up to 8 speakers, stretching it way beyond just that of a home cinema system. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The beauty of <strong>JetStreamNet</strong> is that it's wireless. It's fairly common in relationships that one partner is extremely resistant to housing a surround sound system which has exposed wires trailing across the room, even if it's hidden it can result in ugly trunking or uncomfortable bulges in carpets. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">At last, a home cinema system with surround sound speakers that do not require any cable whatsoever. With up to 8 hours play time on a single charge you could watch Game of Thrones Season 7 right the way through. Of course, if you do have wall sockets near your sofa, plugging them in means they'll work forever and never need audio cables to deliver the sounds. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Wireless range is impressive too, with a range of up to 50 metres, so if you're looking to set up a multi-room system with speakers located throughout your home you can achieve this in almost all home environments.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513267614/tcfwn97pi0j0qfdpbll5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513267631/z2zanv8dekcifoe9w2wd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Designed with today's modern living fully at the fore the S-Series Home Cinema System has been designed to complement typical living room sizes for the modern millennial. Our in-house graphics and electronic design teams laboured extensively on how to deliver an extremely compact looking speaker range that would not look unsightly in minimalists room without having to compromise on the sound we all expect when watching movies. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Using Damson’s innovative audio technology, the soundbar and subwoofer are designed to be discreet while delivering powerful sound. At just 240mm/9.5 inches wide, your eyes will be on the action, not the soundbar. Wide-Field Stereo technology that was first seen in Damson's Vulcan Bluetooth Speaker was again used to recreate the impression of a stereo speaker yet improved further to give a much wider soundstage. The effect is stunning, in recent tests many listeners were shocked that the sound was coming from a single speaker. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The S-Woofer is linked permanently to the S-Bar, wirelessly. Inputs include 2 x HDMI input, Aux in, HDMI out to the TV with support for Audio Return Channel (ARC). Using patented technology the super slim subwoofer houses an ultra-slim subwoofer driver. The S-Woofer will not look out of place sitting alongside your television set up or can be discreetly placed out of view. Both S-Bar and S-Woofer are supplied with a universal power supply. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513269607/a722omewuzxfinm0tbgy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Let's talk about Dolby Atmos. Dolby Atmos delivers audio in totally different way to the way we are all used to. Instead of sounds being split into 2 channels sound is separated out as objects. Being object based it allows the audio engineers to deliver sound precisely where they want you to hear it. This can be in front, behind or even now (finally) above you. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513270655/vtzpnslpdrztl2jw6juk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Damson delivers this with the Dolby-Atmos speaker extension that slots onto the soundbar pushing sound vertically using the ceiling of the room to reflect the sound so you hear it coming from above you. More than that, surround sound sounds utterly natural, the wind blows all around, rain falls overhead. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513270678/styavipsp2xgybfdyhrx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513352502/wxc2e9hujhd7oyuwhbn6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">More and more Dolby Atmos supported content is being released daily and currently supports over 300 Hollywood movies.

It's why we added ""Series"" to the name.

With incredibly simple plug and play set up and truly wireless surround sound, advance your home cinema experience to the next level. Dolby® Atmos is changing the sound of entertainment. Moving audio flows around you in three-dimensional space, transporting you to the heart of the action, creating the very best environment for enjoying the cinema experience at home. Now you can experience movies, music videos and your favourite box sets exactly as the director wants.Damson’s built-in JetStreamNet Wireless Technology means no messy cables. And with a simple and intuitive set-up, you’ll be enjoying the sound in next to no time. It has also been tested relentlessly to ensure it is robust, stable and has exceptional low latency (lip sync to you and me!) achieving latency of under 20m/s. It is also Damson's own proprietary wireless network and allows you to connect up to 8 speakers, stretching it way beyond just that of a home cinema system. The beauty of JetStreamNet is that it's wireless. It's fairly common in relationships that one partner is extremely resistant to housing a surround sound system which has exposed wires trailing across the room, even if it's hidden it can result in ugly trunking or uncomfortable bulges in carpets. At last, a home cinema system with surround sound speakers that do not require any cable whatsoever. With up to 8 hours play time on a single charge you could watch Game of Thrones Season 7 right the way through. Of course, if you do have wall sockets near your sofa, plugging them in means they'll work forever and never need audio cables to deliver the sounds. Wireless range is impressive too, with a range of up to 50 metres, so if you're looking to set up a multi-room system with speakers located throughout your home you can achieve this in almost all home environments. Designed with today's modern living fully at the fore the S-Series Home Cinema System has been designed to complement typical living room sizes for the modern millennial. Our in-house graphics and electronic design teams laboured extensively on how to deliver an extremely compact looking speaker range that would not look unsightly in minimalists room without having to compromise on the sound we all expect when watching movies. Using Damson’s innovative audio technology, the soundbar and subwoofer are designed to be discreet while delivering powerful sound. At just 240mm/9.5 inches wide, your eyes will be on the action, not the soundbar. Wide-Field Stereo technology that was first seen in Damson's Vulcan Bluetooth Speaker was again used to recreate the impression of a stereo speaker yet improved further to give a much wider soundstage. The effect is stunning, in recent tests many listeners were shocked that the sound was coming from a single speaker. The S-Woofer is linked permanently to the S-Bar, wirelessly. Inputs include 2 x HDMI input, Aux in, HDMI out to the TV with support for Audio Return Channel (ARC). Using patented technology the super slim subwoofer houses an ultra-slim subwoofer driver. The S-Woofer will not look out of place sitting alongside your television set up or can be discreetly placed out of view. Both S-Bar and S-Woofer are supplied with a universal power supply. Let's talk about Dolby Atmos. Dolby Atmos delivers audio in totally different way to the way we are all used to. Instead of sounds being split into 2 channels sound is separated out as objects. Being object based it allows the audio engineers to deliver sound precisely where they want you to hear it. This can be in front, behind or even now (finally) above you. Damson delivers this with the Dolby-Atmos speaker extension that slots onto the soundbar pushing sound vertically using the ceiling of the room to reflect the sound so you hear it coming from above you. More than that, surround sound sounds utterly natural, the wind blows all around, rain falls overhead. More and more Dolby Atmos supported content is being released daily and currently supports over 300 Hollywood movies. Boxsets are also being produced in Dolby Atmos including Game of Thrones and sports fans can watch live sports events like the English Premier League (EPL), Video streaming providers are delivering Dolby Atmos enabled content with Netflix having even commissioned its own series with Dolby Atmos support. Don't worry if the title or boxset you are watching doesn't support Dolby Atmos as the S-Series is fully backwards compatible with all of Dolby's other audio codecs.More than just surround sound speakers switching them into Bluetooth mode turns them into stereo speakers in their own right.The S-Cube is a portable speaker with premium audio. you can use a single S-Cube by itself or connect with up to eight additional speakers to create a multi-speaker network of sound. Take them to a field, or the middle of the desert for your own rave or Coachella and dish out awesome wireless sound through up to 8 speakers. The S-Cube features a built-in Lithium Ion battery as well as AC power supply.Damson will shortly be selling S-Cubes separately allowing users to add to their system.The S-Series: Dolby Atmos Wireless Home Cinema System supports video pass through for Dolby Vision and HDR-10 Ultra High Definition (UHD) video making it compatible with 4K video and ensuring you are watching the highest possible quality as well as being able to listen to it. At Damson we do not cut corners. Knowing that an advanced sound system requires advanced accessories Damson has created a remote control that does not require line of sight for operation, meaning you can place your S-Woofer out of view. If you prefer a universal remote control, like Logitech's Harmony range, then plug the HDMI output into the ARC HDMI of your display and use your remote control to power on/off, change volume or mute etc. Damson recognises that technology is constantly on the change. In just 5 years TV's have gone from HD through Full HD to the current Ultra HD and talk is already mooted about Super Hi-Vision (8K) and while many people are prepared to upgrade their TV's the same is not always true of audio systems. The S-Series is built with this in mind. It's why we added ""Series"" to the name. We wanted to ensure what you were buying today would work with you for many years to come, the electronic design was carefully developed to allow it to operate as modular system. This means that when we bring out new models you will not have to upgrade the entire system, just add on that model as you wish. We are already in early planning development for several models which will extend your audio pleasure even further.   It's taken a while, we'll be honest with that. Now we are pleased to say we are in final pre-production sampling with full mass production due to begin imminently. We expect to ship out the first orders in Feburary 2018. Shipping is a charged at a flat $30 per perk chosen. If you buy multiple perks you will be charged additional shipping fees. This is because the S-Series: Dolby Atmos Home Cinema System weighs in at 6.75kg (15lb) and is an expensive item to ship.We have not identified fully where we will be shipping from. It is possible that some territories where the import duty threshold is less than the value of the perk price that import duties and other charges will be charged, these are usually lower if paid in advance. If you feel you are in a territory which has a threshold for import duties below this please contact Damson support to discuss options that are available to you in order to minimise your import duty.  Options could include delivering your order duty paid - at an additional cost where you agree to cover the cost of the duties in advance, or for those in European countries waiting until our sea container shipments have been delivered to York allowing us to ship out internally from within the EU at no additional duty charges to yourselves. Please do not ask us to ship this item as a $10 gift.

We had a few priorities when designing WOW-SOUND; it had to be loud, it had to sound good, it had to have a battery that could last all day on the water, preferably all weekend, and we wanted it to fit into a cup holder that we include on many of our inflatable products. The farther along we got into the process the more we realized that we were not only building a great speaker for fun on the water, but we were building a great speaker for pretty much any outdoor activity. That is when we started getting really excited and decided that we had to reach as many people who love outdoors as we could. Which is a big reason why we decided to get the project started with the Indiegogo community.</p>

<p><strong>How did a watersports company go from building inflatables to building a speaker?</strong></p>
<p>We hired and worked with a lot of experts in the business to help us design and build the speaker we wanted.  One of the things we believe we have at WOW is good taste and an eye for a good product.  We came up with our vision of what we wanted in a speaker based on our extensive experience of how people use products on the water and in the outdoors and we worked with a professional team that could turn that vision into a great product.  We have an office in the U.S. and near the production facilities in China so we were able to work closely with the design side in the U.S. and the manufacturing side in China on a day to day basis.  We were perhaps overly careful and methodical to make sure we didn't make any mistakes, which is why this project has taken us over 3 years to complete! </p>
<p><strong>When will I get my WOW-SOUND Speaker?</strong></p>
<p>Great news! We have finalized our tooling and final production and we'll be able to get the WOW-SOUND speaker to you right before you head out to do all those amazing summer activities. WOW- SOUND will begin delivering in June 2017.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main features of the WOW-SOUND Speaker?</strong></p>
<p>We are excited to bring you more than 50 hours of battery life, more than any other bluetooth speaker on the market. WOW-SOUND is waterproof, floats and comes with 360-degree HI-FI sound and 360-degree bright LED lights for visibility at night.</p>
<p><strong>Can I select a color for my Speaker?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, we are offering the speaker in Electric Orange. We hope to reach our stretch goal of $200K so that we can begin producing the additional colors you see in this campaign. With your help we will be able to offer additional colors soon.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to download an app to listen to my speaker?</strong></p>
<p>No, the WOW-SOUND speaker will connect easily to any bluetooth device. Use existing music apps on your phone. No special apps are needed to listen to the WOW-SOUND speaker.</p>
<p><strong>Can I drop my speaker into the Water?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the WOW-SOUND Speaker is waterproof up to 3 feet (1 meter) for 30 minutes. The great news is that it floats, so you don't have to worry about diving to retrieve your speaker when you're in the water.</p>
<p><strong>How long does the WOW-SOUND speaker last?</strong></p>
<p>WOW-Sound has 50 hours of battery life. The battery life varies on the volume you are listening at as well as the type of music you are listening to.  It will depend on how much you use the speaker, but it is well equipped to last in the outdoors for any activities including watersports activities, camping and much more. The 360-degree LED lights make it so that you can use it any time of day or night.</p>
<p><strong>Can I connect to other speakers?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the WOW-SOUND speaker includes the TrueWireless Bluetooth function so you can connect it to an additional WOW-SOUND speaker for booming stereo sound giving you the ultimate outdoor audio experience for pool parties, social occasions, camping and more.</p>
<p><strong>What is IP67 Rated Mean?</strong></p>
<p>IP67 means that the speaker is protected from dust, dirt and sand entering the speaker and that the speaker is waterproof down to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>What will be the retail price of the WOW-SOUND Speaker?</strong></p>
<p>We are excited to offer it to our Indiegogo backers first for a great discount. The MSRP for WOW-SOUND will be $229 when it comes to market in June 2017.</p>

Despite many accolades over those 5-years, despite building a nationwide audience, and despite being named as one of America's best by publications such as Sports Illustrated and Talkers Magazine (The Bible Of The Talk Radio Industry), Dino has found re-engaging within the field of talk radio to be problematic. It would seem that the talk radio industry is even more risk-averse at this juncture than it was when Dino left SiriusXM Radio back in 2013. An unfortunate environment of 'sameness' has ensconced the industry - and the resulting fall out has seen Dino on the outside looking in for far too long.</p><p>In these risk-averse times, and with people apparently unaccustomed to outside the box and visionary thinking in the field of radio, Dino decided to take his show to New York, where he was born and raised, projecting his one of a kind show to New York sports fans in search of something far different from the status-quo, and self-funding his show on AM-970, WNYM Radio.</p><p>The inaugural broadcast was in early January of 2018, and since that time The Show has grown more than impressively. For example, The Show is featured on numerous platforms in an archive form - and statistics from iTunes and other like-minded sites show an increase of over 337% in individual downloads of Dino's Show from January 2018 to late May 2018.</p><p>In addition, The Show has been mentioned in the sports pages of the NY Daily News a total of ten (10) times since Dino started broadcasting in January 2018, featured in the Daily News sports media column.</p><p>The SHOW continues to grow, new listeners continue to come on board, and despite its overnight broadcast hours (12-3AM) The DINO COSTA Show has fast made its way into the New York sports radio scene as a much-looked to outlet for New York sports fans in search of Dino's original thought and opinion on myriad issues and items.</p><p>Will this one of a kind, irrepressible, sports-themed radio show ever be picked up by another station that covers sports more thoroughly than Dino's current radio home? That's to be determined, and Dino has gone into this project with the 'long-view' clearly in mind. The emphasis currently, is to continue producing one great and different show after another, solid blocks of sports radio for listeners, with a soundtrack of sports radio unavailable anywhere else.</p><p>To date, Dino has self-funded this project and contributed over $15,000 necessary to purchase the airtime for his Show. Now, he is graciously asking for your help to keep this thriving radio platform going for months, and if necessary, years to come.</p><p>One of the other changes that have come to the world of radio can be found in 'brokered programming.' In fact, it is difficult to find stations across the country who do not generate much of their revenue streams by incorporating brokered shows into their lineup. Moreover, there are radio stations, including several in the New York area who have fashioned a brokered schedules exclusively for their dial locations.</p><p>You are obviously under no obligation to help to keep The DINO COSTA Show on the air.

It would seem that the talk radio industry is even more risk-averse at this juncture than it was when Dino left SiriusXM Radio back in 2013. An unfortunate environment of 'sameness' has ensconced the industry - and the resulting fall out has seen Dino on the outside looking in for far too long.In these risk-averse times, and with people apparently unaccustomed to outside the box and visionary thinking in the field of radio, Dino decided to take his show to New York, where he was born and raised, projecting his one of a kind show to New York sports fans in search of something far different from the status-quo, and self-funding his show on AM-970, WNYM Radio.The inaugural broadcast was in early January of 2018, and since that time The Show has grown more than impressively. For example, The Show is featured on numerous platforms in an archive form - and statistics from iTunes and other like-minded sites show an increase of over 337% in individual downloads of Dino's Show from January 2018 to late May 2018.In addition, The Show has been mentioned in the sports pages of the NY Daily News a total of ten (10) times since Dino started broadcasting in January 2018, featured in the Daily News sports media column.The SHOW continues to grow, new listeners continue to come on board, and despite its overnight broadcast hours (12-3AM) The DINO COSTA Show has fast made its way into the New York sports radio scene as a much-looked to outlet for New York sports fans in search of Dino's original thought and opinion on myriad issues and items.Will this one of a kind, irrepressible, sports-themed radio show ever be picked up by another station that covers sports more thoroughly than Dino's current radio home? That's to be determined, and Dino has gone into this project with the 'long-view' clearly in mind. The emphasis currently, is to continue producing one great and different show after another, solid blocks of sports radio for listeners, with a soundtrack of sports radio unavailable anywhere else.To date, Dino has self-funded this project and contributed over $15,000 necessary to purchase the airtime for his Show. Now, he is graciously asking for your help to keep this thriving radio platform going for months, and if necessary, years to come.One of the other changes that have come to the world of radio can be found in 'brokered programming.' In fact, it is difficult to find stations across the country who do not generate much of their revenue streams by incorporating brokered shows into their lineup. Moreover, there are radio stations, including several in the New York area who have fashioned a brokered schedules exclusively for their dial locations.You are obviously under no obligation to help to keep The DINO COSTA Show on the air. You may continue to listen as often or as little as you like without any financial contribution.However, each month from now on, The Show will keep a page like this one active, hoping that there are those who not only have a more than healthy enthusiasm for The Show, but who also want to willingly assist The Show to meet its financial obligations each month, and who possess the financial wherewithal to make a contribution of some kind.Dino will continue to do all that he can do financially on his own in order to ensure that his Show remains of the air and continues to provide a one of a kind sports radio exclusive to a growing base of listeners, both in the New York area and around the country with those who listen to The Show Online.We thank you for any and all consideration, and if you do contribute, we thank you even more, for helping to keep The DINO COSTA Show on the air, where it belongs, in New York City, today, and hopefully for many days to come.Thak you.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

For this reason, we have redesigned the speaker itself. Using extensive research, we have built custom speaker drivers from the highest-quality materials, previously only used in large expensive sound systems

audio. What makes them so special? They feature evenly spaced magnets on both sides of the diaphragm that act on a flat plane—hence the name “planar”—which results in carefully tuned phase-correct sound.

<li>
<strong>FEM-Optimized Magnet System: </strong>To maximize driver sensitivity and consistency, Panda features a FEM-optimized magnet system with high-energy, high-quality Neodymium magnets.</li>
<li>
<strong>True Phase Coherence: </strong>Sound travels like a wave. With a traditional driver, the wave can be disrupted, resulting in abnormal peaks and valleys. With a planar-ribbon driver, all parts of the driver diaphragm vibrate together without breakup or delayed resonance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Double-Sided Spiraling Coils:</strong> Designed with a flat, spiraling conductor pattern, Panda allows twice as many conductors to be placed within the magnetic field. This creates higher sensitivity, better damping, and even drive force.</li>
<li>
<strong>7-Layer Diaphragm:</strong> Comprised of seven thin layers, the diaphragms inside each driver are engineered for performance and reliability. They perform well under thermal stress and vibration.</li>
<li>
<strong>Purely Resistive Impedance: </strong>Absent of inductive components, Panda’s planar-ribbon drivers eliminate inductance-related intermodulation distortion—a common problem found in dynamic drivers.</li>

George Lucas shocked the world with Star Wars Episodes IV and V, and he was gearing up to complete the trilogy. But something still plagued Lucas. Though he’d spent months creating special sound effects, some of them—like the faint cello in one of Princess Leia’s classic scenes—couldn’t be heard during screening. As a result, Lucas made it his mission to ensure that theaters projected all of the intended sound he heard during the mix. Thus, THX was born.</p><p><br/>Today, you may know THX from the goosebump-inducing “Deep Note” played before many blockbuster films. When you see the “THX” insignia, be assured that no piece of equipment earns that label without demonstrating the highest audio or visual quality.

Whether you need a crash course on a certain topic or you want to explore its many complexities, forums provide a way for people of all levels of expertise to connect, share, and learn. It’s this magic that inspired the creation of Drop.</p><p>Founded in 2012, Drop (originally called Massdrop) helps gear enthusiasts get closer to the things they love. The company’s first initiative was helping members of an Audi forum acquire a rare grille manufactured in Taiwan. After successfully coordinating a $40,000 group buy, it was clear this new kind of forum had legs. So, Drop set its sights on other interest groups, most notably the audiophile community.</p><p>Gathering insights from music lovers on its built-in discussion system, Drop reached out to AKG to create an exclusive version of the legendary K702 65th-anniversary-edition headphones.

</div></div>","The world’s first wireless Hi-Fi headphone, Panda features never-before-seen tech in a never-leave-at-home design. Thanks to its planar-ribbon drivers (powered by THX AAA™ amplifier technology) with audio delivered from your phone via Sony’s LDAC Bluetooth, Panda puts you closer to your music than ever before—wherever life takes you.  A collaboration between Drop and THX, Panda lets you discover new details in your favorite songs. Equipped with a THX AAA™ amplifier, planar-ribbon drivers, and a high-bandwidth Bluetooth audio codec (a proprietary never-before-seen combination known as the 3P Signal Path), Panda is the world’s first headphone to deliver an audiophile listening experience—wirelessly. It sets a new standard when listening to music, watching movies, or playing games.

 Good news: production is underway! Check out these pictures of the left and right earcups being made in the molding-injection tool.  




    Planar-ribbon drivers are synonymous with high-quality audio. What makes them so special? They feature evenly spaced magnets on both sides of the diaphragm that act on a flat plane—hence the name “planar”—which results in carefully tuned phase-correct sound. Thanks to the evenly suspended diaphragm, planar-ribbon drivers are extremely resistant to distortion, boasting a hyper-realistic sound signature as you’ve never before experienced.  

FEM-Optimized Magnet System: To maximize driver sensitivity and consistency, Panda features a FEM-optimized magnet system with high-energy, high-quality Neodymium magnets.

True Phase Coherence: Sound travels like a wave. With a traditional driver, the wave can be disrupted, resulting in abnormal peaks and valleys. With a planar-ribbon driver, all parts of the driver diaphragm vibrate together without breakup or delayed resonance.

Double-Sided Spiraling Coils: Designed with a flat, spiraling conductor pattern, Panda allows twice as many conductors to be placed within the magnetic field. This creates higher sensitivity, better damping, and even drive force.

7-Layer Diaphragm: Comprised of seven thin layers, the diaphragms inside each driver are engineered for performance and reliability. They perform well under thermal stress and vibration.

Purely Resistive Impedance: Absent of inductive components, Panda’s planar-ribbon drivers eliminate inductance-related intermodulation distortion—a common problem found in dynamic drivers.
  Panda is the world’s first headphone with integrated THX AAA™ amplifier technology. Designed to reduce harmonic, intermodulation, and crossover distortions, this technology transmits original audio in its purest possible form. Using patented feed-forward error-correction topology, it reduces distortion by 20 to 100 times—currently the world’s lowest levels of distortion. And no matter how loud you listen, the THX AAA™ amplifier can drive Panda to comfortable listening volumes with headroom to spare.               The year was 1982. George Lucas shocked the world with Star Wars Episodes IV and V, and he was gearing up to complete the trilogy. But something still plagued Lucas. Though he’d spent months creating special sound effects, some of them—like the faint cello in one of Princess Leia’s classic scenes—couldn’t be heard during screening. As a result, Lucas made it his mission to ensure that theaters projected all of the intended sound he heard during the mix. Thus, THX was born.Today, you may know THX from the goosebump-inducing “Deep Note” played before many blockbuster films. When you see the “THX” insignia, be assured that no piece of equipment earns that label without demonstrating the highest audio or visual quality. It’s a sure sign that the product is powerful enough to transport you to a galaxy far, far away—just like it did in theaters over 40 years ago.

Whether you need a crash course on a certain topic or you want to explore its many complexities, forums provide a way for people of all levels of expertise to connect, share, and learn. It’s this magic that inspired the creation of Drop.Founded in 2012, Drop (originally called Massdrop) helps gear enthusiasts get closer to the things they love. The company’s first initiative was helping members of an Audi forum acquire a rare grille manufactured in Taiwan. After successfully coordinating a $40,000 group buy, it was clear this new kind of forum had legs. So, Drop set its sights on other interest groups, most notably the audiophile community.Gathering insights from music lovers on its built-in discussion system, Drop reached out to AKG to create an exclusive version of the legendary K702 65th-anniversary-edition headphones. The project was a huge success, and a key turning point for the future. It was then the founders realized the true potential of enthusiasts on Drop—after all, they know these products better than anyone, and know what they want better than anyone.Since the popular AKG K7XX headset, Drop has launched hundreds of successful collaborations and exclusive designs. Today, it’s a destination for innovative community-inspired products and home to over 7 million members, including more than 3 million audiophiles. Headphone type: Closed, planar ribbon Bluetooth wireless technology: 5.0Effective range: Line of sight, approximately 10 m (30 ft)Battery life: 30+ hoursIsolation: -40 dBImpedance: 26 ohmsSensitivity: 100 dB @ 1kHz / 1mWTHD: 94 dB SPL @ 300Hz < 0.1%THX-AAA-0™ Amplifier: -130 dB THD, 2.6 uV A-wt noise, and 10 mW power consumptionFrequency response: 10–50,000 HzDriver unit: 55mm, ribbon planar magneticMicrophones: DualWeight: 13.2 oz (375 g)Water Resistance: IPX4 (Protects from splashing water from any direction)

SlimBuds have a low-profile design which allow the rider to comfortably slide their helmet over their ears. They are so comfortably that you might even forget they are in you ears.  The silicone ear grips take the natural shape of your ear.  They ensure a secure fitment inside the ear and are skin-friendly. Stop dealing with your earbuds falling out of your ears.   With SlimBuds, ride with any of your helmets without worrying about mounting a speaker system on them. This is the beauty of having SlimBuds, your music doesn't have to stop once you take off your helmet.  SlimBuds provide passive noise isolation which keeps unwanted wind and engine noise out of your ears, allowing you to listen to your audio with clarity. Enjoy clear conversations while riding. After conducting hundreds of tests, we found that the most ideal place to put a mic is right on the chin below the lower lip.So we designed a mic exactly at that spot. We call it the ""Chin-Mic"". It's simple but effective. It gets minimal wind interference for clear conversations while wearing a helmet. On bicycle, you can even use them without a full face helmet. They have been tested and work better then most solutions out there today. If you are riding faster then 40 mph, you are subjected to extreme wind noise which can damage your hearing permanently. Wind noise damages your hearing over a period of time until you wake up one day and realize you can't hear that well anymore. This damage is permanent and can not be fixed. SlimBuds protect the rider's ears from loud engines and wind noise. They provide a safe level of listening for the rider.  Awareness At EAOS, safety is very important to us. As good as our SlimBuds sound, we are equally focused on keeping you safe while riding. Inside the chin piece there is a secondary microphone dedicated to listening to your environment. It then sends this information in real time to your phone where the co-pilot evaluates it. If it senses something important it will playback the surroundings to the rider. This means that sirens, horns or anything else you need to hear, you’ll hear it with the Co-Pilot.  Our CSR chip uses aptX technology to improve data transmission speeds which allows the Co-Pilot app to warn the rider within split seconds, faster then you can react. It also allows for CD quality audio through Bluetooth.  Emergency Situations We hope you don't ever need to use it, but in case the situation arises your Co-Pilot is here for you. Using the Co-Pilot app you can send your location to pre-saved emergency contacts with a tap of a button. Your emergency contacts will receive your location so they can find you or send help immediately.    Chat With Your Friends Use the EAOS Co-Pilot app to add your friends to your chat before your ride. You can have multiple friends in your chat and be in communication with everyone at the same time.The app will run in the background, only picking up on what you are saying when you hit the push-to-talk button on the SlimRemote. The Co-Pilot app uses your phones LTE capability to allow for unlimited range. No matter the distance you will be able to stay connected with your riding buddies at all times.   Zero Distraction ControlsControls at the tip of your fingers, the SlimRemote connects via latest Bluetooth technology to your device and allows you to control your audio, pick up phone calls, and activate voice commands all while riding. The SlimRemote is carefully designed to minimize distraction on the road. Inspired by the traditional lever design it allows for control without lifting your hand off the handlebar.Push-To-TalkWhile connected to the EAOS Co-Pilot app, you can talk to your friends with just the click of a button, using the SlimRemote. The SlimRemote features a push-to-talk button for riders to communicate with ease.Water ResistantIn the case of unpredictable weather, EAOS has you covered. We built the SlimRemote to be water resistant so it can accompany you when you get caught in the rain.   SlimBuds are powered by one of the smallest and most powerful sound drivers, delivering deep lows for immense bass and clear highs for crisp treble. We source our sound drivers from a company that has decades of experience in delivering superior audio quality. The SlimBuds battery is designed to last even during the longest of rides. It pumps out a reliable 6 hours of play time to accompany you everywhere. Our charging port is standard Micro-USB, which means less cable confusion.We have 2 microphones integrated into the design of the SlimBuds. The first mic is dedicated to the rider's communication. The second mic is solely dedicated to listening to the environment. This data is transferred via a powerful CSR chip through a bluetooth connection in real time to your phone within a thousandth of a second. This is where the Co-Pilot app picks up to assist the rider with crucial sounds.     We're proud to have SlimBuds fans all over the world! We will ship the SlimBuds worldwide, with the exception of Argentina, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Like a lot of you, I’ve become more and more frustrated to be told that my great hi-fi gear (which works perfectly well) is outdated, that the Almighty Technology Spirit just wants me to replace it with something else, not something better, just something compatible. I’ve got wired headphones which I love, and I don’t want to throw them away in the “obsolete” bin. The best cans out there are wired, and I want to be able to use them and enjoy them.</p><p>Tip, ring and sleeve. The technology behind the headphone jack goes all the way back to 1878.  A glorious century and a half of reliable audio connections, and a vibrant and historical case of « If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it » </p><p>When I started hearing rumours about Apple dropping the audio jack on their next phone I thought it was enough, we have one standard, we’ve had it for over a century and it works with everything. I didn’t know how to fix this, but I had a feeling something could be done.</p><p>As luck has it, the greatest product designer I know, Stephane, also happens to be my brother-in-law and he lives right downstairs. We started brainstorming on the best way for us to keep enjoying our (wired) gear with a device/product/invention/whatever that would also make use of leading edge technology. </p><p>Our family project developed well and Bluewave was born, and here we are, asking you to contribute and help us make our dream a reality.

We know, it’s a bold statement. You’re probably thinking: Wait a minute, since when Bluetooth with its different Codecs that all use compression can sound better than audio travelling through a wire? We agree, you are right! It’s normally not the case.</p><p>If you listen to lossless files like FLACs those will go through a lossy compression algorithm before they reach GET. That’s unavoidable considering the absolute maximum of 768 Kbps in the audio distribution profile of Bluetooth 4.2. </p><p>So it comes down to just this: The benefits are greater than the cost. Whether or not the degradation in a low ratio compression can be heard is still a debate and is hard to measure. We are not talking about 128 kbps files here, which are horrible, good quality rips -whether it’s AAC or Mp3- will be left untouched and reproduced in all their glory, at the maximum bitrate supported by your source device.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478905793/btuxxxlo9wc3xv3wnvrt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>So back to our original claim, how did we manage to achieve it? Well we don’t have control over the Bluetooth protocol (although we use it to its maximum potential) but what we do have control on is everything else that makes a good sounding device. You might have been disappointed with audio quality of Bluetooth devices, that’s where know-how and quality components come into play.</p><p>So there you have it: the main reason it sounds better is because <strong>the gain in sound quality from a well designed, dedicated amplifier compared to what’s in your phone has more impact than the theoretical bitrate loss </strong>  GET offers many electronic design features that would be expected in devices many times its cost:</p><p><strong>1 : Fully differential signal path.</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What that means is that any noise picked up by the antenna or internally by the electronics will be rejected by the amplification circuit. In some ways it works similarly to what is more common to the end user: a balanced cable. There are a few differences that I won’t go through here but what it basically does is that the left and right audio signal each are appearing twice to the input of the amplifier, but with an inverted polarity. Since noise is normally common in both conductors, the added noise can be detected and rejected. We’re over-simplifying here, but the bottom line is: it works, you don’t want noise polluting that amazing song right?</p><p><strong>2 :  No capacitors in the audio signal.</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Capacitors in an audio path degrade audio and increase the harmonic distortion (THD) in a measurable way.  The small ceramic capacitors that are usually present in a miniature design like that are actually the worst, but that’s actually the most convenient way to remove a residual DC voltage in the signal. We didn’t go the easy way. For us audiophiles, capacitors are evil, so we managed to just not have DC. We never settled with putting a cap there and call it done. We were dedicated and optimised our circuit: we did it with proper power planes isolation and components that talk well with each other.</p><p><strong>3 : State of the art star grounding scheme.  </strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">That’s where the real art is, there is no textbook procedure to good grounding. Yes there are generalities, like separating digital and analog ground but even that is not properly implemented in most low cost Bluetooth device we tested, and that’s just the tip of the Iceberg. Ground is the reference against which we base our signal, but more importantly it’s the return path for current. We can’t stress that enough: Grounding must be thoroughly thought of as it influences the whole circuit layout. Residual voltages on ground and currents in unwanted areas of the circuit means improper audio bias, channel imbalance, audio crosstalk, bad reception, noise problems, etc. The list could go on and we’ve seen all kinds of things.  We’re not taking this lightly. We’ve created a beautifully crafted network that insures the audio signal travels the way we want it, with nothing added to it.</p><p><strong>4 Digital to analog conversion</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We can’t take much credit here, but can certainly tell you that in terms of conversion embedded in a wireless chip, we went straight to Qualcomm/CSR’s flagship: the CSR8675. That’s the component that receives the digital signal from the antenna and outputs the analog audio signal. This component is expensive but it’s worth every penny. As of today, it’s the only Bluetooth controller that allows 24 bit audio and its integrated DAC performs very well.</p><p>By doing things right and never cutting corners, we can give you a sound clarity unheard of before in this type of device. You’ll get to experience amazingly low distortion, and virtually no noise for a completely black Background with the punchy and fast bass that proper amplification can bring.

It’s small, light and will drive any headphones beautifully, wirelessly.  Our GuaranteeYour headphones will sound better plugged into GET than plugged directly in your phone.Don't take our word for it. Experience it yourself. GET brings your music to life. This is true with any wired headphones and any music files. If you don't find that there is a noticeable benefit with GET, return it for a full refund. That's how confident we are with our product. Using GET is super easyPlug-in your headphones to GET and pair it to your smartphone via Bluetooth, NFC pairing works too. Once paired, you can enjoy music with the highest level of clarity, answer phone calls thanks to the integrated high quality MEMS microphone, control your music with the play/pause/shuffle buttons and adjust volume without ever having to handle your phone.Headphones, just like speakers, need to be driven, so there’s a (tiny) amplifier in every smartphone but it’s not powerful enough to properly drive your headphones. You may not realize it, but you’ve probably never heard the full potential of your beloved cans.GET can also turn any home sound system into a high performance wireless audio platform.GET supports all existing codecs for Bluetooth transmission, including AAC, AptX and the upcoming 24-bit AptX-HD. It also supports EDR (Enhanced Data Rate). Forget what you know or heard so far with basic Bluetooth devices, this is just in another league. The Storyor why your wired headphones are NOT obsolete.I’m Pierre, music lover, audiophile, and engineer. Like a lot of you, I’ve become more and more frustrated to be told that my great hi-fi gear (which works perfectly well) is outdated, that the Almighty Technology Spirit just wants me to replace it with something else, not something better, just something compatible. I’ve got wired headphones which I love, and I don’t want to throw them away in the “obsolete” bin. The best cans out there are wired, and I want to be able to use them and enjoy them.Tip, ring and sleeve. The technology behind the headphone jack goes all the way back to 1878.  A glorious century and a half of reliable audio connections, and a vibrant and historical case of « If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it » When I started hearing rumours about Apple dropping the audio jack on their next phone I thought it was enough, we have one standard, we’ve had it for over a century and it works with everything. I didn’t know how to fix this, but I had a feeling something could be done.As luck has it, the greatest product designer I know, Stephane, also happens to be my brother-in-law and he lives right downstairs. We started brainstorming on the best way for us to keep enjoying our (wired) gear with a device/product/invention/whatever that would also make use of leading edge technology. Our family project developed well and Bluewave was born, and here we are, asking you to contribute and help us make our dream a reality. We’re really proud of what we’ve accomplished and our greatest joy is when people try GET for the first time, go wide eyed, start to smile and say: ""Wow, this sounds so much BETTER!"". The Iphone7 conundrumApple’s new IPhone7 has no jack and everyone’s wondering how it will work with their existing headphones. Sure, Apple provides a dongle adapter to make do but your headphones deserve better. We honestly think GET is a far more elegant, practical and useful way to go forward. If you have wired headphones and want to connect them to your brand new Iphone, here are your choices: Specifications GET's intelligent RGB LED gives feedback so you always know about the pairing state, battery status and the type of Codec used. GET’s App!Get comes with a great companion app for Android and iOS. You will be able to access many controls:An awesome equalizer to personalize GET’s tone, visual feedback for the battery charge level and the Bluetooth signal, an option to turn the LED off and many more settings, including the ability to do firmware updates. Get Cash Back on the Projects You Love! Featured in Testimonials“It’s like listening to the same song but straight from the recording studio”-Bruno Gugglielminetti (Canoe.ca)""The difference in sound quality between the regular sound and the sound amplified by GET is audible right away and frankly impressive ""-Sarah-Emilie Nault (Le Huffington post)  AccessoriesOur “Headset Mount Accessory Pack” includes a high quality ultra-short cable with either a 3.5mm or 2.5mm plug and a purpose built Headphone Clip. It’s available in limited quantity at a very special “end of campaign” price of $9.00 USD, a 40% savings on the $14.99 retail price! GEEK CORNER!A long, dry and technical explanation of what we love to do.So, yes, we’re saying: «your headphones will sound BETTER plugged into GET than plugged directly into your smartphone». We know, it’s a bold statement. You’re probably thinking: Wait a minute, since when Bluetooth with its different Codecs that all use compression can sound better than audio travelling through a wire? We agree, you are right! It’s normally not the case.If you listen to lossless files like FLACs those will go through a lossy compression algorithm before they reach GET. That’s unavoidable considering the absolute maximum of 768 Kbps in the audio distribution profile of Bluetooth 4.2. So it comes down to just this: The benefits are greater than the cost. Whether or not the degradation in a low ratio compression can be heard is still a debate and is hard to measure. We are not talking about 128 kbps files here, which are horrible, good quality rips -whether it’s AAC or Mp3- will be left untouched and reproduced in all their glory, at the maximum bitrate supported by your source device.So back to our original claim, how did we manage to achieve it? Well we don’t have control over the Bluetooth protocol (although we use it to its maximum potential) but what we do have control on is everything else that makes a good sounding device. You might have been disappointed with audio quality of Bluetooth devices, that’s where know-how and quality components come into play.So there you have it: the main reason it sounds better is because the gain in sound quality from a well designed, dedicated amplifier compared to what’s in your phone has more impact than the theoretical bitrate loss   GET offers many electronic design features that would be expected in devices many times its cost:1 : Fully differential signal path.What that means is that any noise picked up by the antenna or internally by the electronics will be rejected by the amplification circuit. In some ways it works similarly to what is more common to the end user: a balanced cable. There are a few differences that I won’t go through here but what it basically does is that the left and right audio signal each are appearing twice to the input of the amplifier, but with an inverted polarity. Since noise is normally common in both conductors, the added noise can be detected and rejected. We’re over-simplifying here, but the bottom line is: it works, you don’t want noise polluting that amazing song right?2 :  No capacitors in the audio signal.Capacitors in an audio path degrade audio and increase the harmonic distortion (THD) in a measurable way.  The small ceramic capacitors that are usually present in a miniature design like that are actually the worst, but that’s actually the most convenient way to remove a residual DC voltage in the signal. We didn’t go the easy way. For us audiophiles, capacitors are evil, so we managed to just not have DC. We never settled with putting a cap there and call it done. We were dedicated and optimised our circuit: we did it with proper power planes isolation and components that talk well with each other.3 : State of the art star grounding scheme.  That’s where the real art is, there is no textbook procedure to good grounding. Yes there are generalities, like separating digital and analog ground but even that is not properly implemented in most low cost Bluetooth device we tested, and that’s just the tip of the Iceberg. Ground is the reference against which we base our signal, but more importantly it’s the return path for current. We can’t stress that enough: Grounding must be thoroughly thought of as it influences the whole circuit layout. Residual voltages on ground and currents in unwanted areas of the circuit means improper audio bias, channel imbalance, audio crosstalk, bad reception, noise problems, etc. The list could go on and we’ve seen all kinds of things.  We’re not taking this lightly. We’ve created a beautifully crafted network that insures the audio signal travels the way we want it, with nothing added to it.4 Digital to analog conversionWe can’t take much credit here, but can certainly tell you that in terms of conversion embedded in a wireless chip, we went straight to Qualcomm/CSR’s flagship: the CSR8675. That’s the component that receives the digital signal from the antenna and outputs the analog audio signal. This component is expensive but it’s worth every penny. As of today, it’s the only Bluetooth controller that allows 24 bit audio and its integrated DAC performs very well.By doing things right and never cutting corners, we can give you a sound clarity unheard of before in this type of device. You’ll get to experience amazingly low distortion, and virtually no noise for a completely black Background with the punchy and fast bass that proper amplification can bring. You’ll hear details in your music you didn’t know where there.Prototype development The TeamBluewave is a Montreal-based company that offers affordable wireless high-fidelity audio products.

<br/><p> <b>For USA Olympians:</b></p>
<p>Inspired by and created for elite U.S.A. athletes, the ROPES USA project was launched in January 2016. ROAM founder Steven Lamar created this special patriotic edition of his popular ROPES earphones because of his admiration for Olympians.  Throughout his life, Steven has drawn motivation from Olympians' perseverance, strength and commitment to excellence.  He set out to create a USA-themed version of ROPES earphones to honor the athletes that inspire him.  </p>
<p>Steven’s vision was to leverage the superior audio experience and personalization abilities of the world’s most powerful wireless earphones – into a sporty, sleek, cool, colorful version of ROPES. ROPES USA will be worn and rocked by U.S.A. athletes in Brazil this summer. By participating in this fundraising campaign, you can proudly don your own pair. It’s the next best thing to hanging an Olympic medal around your neck. </p>

<br/><p><b>Artist Sound Signatures:</b></p>
<p>Sound is a musician’s art form, but today’s ordinary earphones only allow listeners to hear music one way – the way the audio engineers decide for you. We value the art of music. And the unique talent it takes to create it. So we created a premium mobile audio platform to reproduce sound that’s true to the artist’s intention. And we partnered with new and established artists alike to create their own unique Artist Sound Signatures for ROAM and USA ROPES users. Starting in the fall of 2016, ROAM users can download an Artist Sound Signature directly to their ROAM EQ app – connecting them to the artist and their recordings in a way that has never been heard or felt before.</p>

</div></div>","Deeply impacted by the tragedy of losing his late-wife Jennifer to brain cancer in 2013, Steven created ROAM, Inc. to blend his expertise in audio with a desire to make mobile devices safer to use. 
ROPES USA are the creative, colorful special edition debut of ROAM ROPES – the world’s first fully-integrated, wearable, Bluetooth earphones with companion amplifier and audio personalization app. The best-sounding and most customizable earphones on the market today, ROPES USA are now available for the first time.






Every ear has its own unique “fingerprint” – or “sound signature,” if you will. No one sound fits all ears. Not even close. That’s why we give you your own EQ.
EQs work in ranges, or “bands.” They let you “cut” and “boost” the high and low ranges of sound – commonly referred to as “treble” and “bass.” Thanks to the ROAM EQ app, you get five full bands of sound to work with. Plus DSP functionality that includes dynamic bass boost, spectral effect, and a preamp gain.





With the ROAM EQ app, you also get some brilliant presets – each one custom-created and crafted for a different genre of music. These aren’t your standard earphone presents. These are carefully, creatively custom-crafted settings that allow you to match your music with your moods. And change the way you experience your music. From song to song. From artist to artist. From album to album. And beyond. It’s all up to you.





Superior sound. Sleek style. Comfortable fit. Colorful looks. ROPES USA offers its wearers all of these features and more, including the ability to customize your listening experience like never before.
The brilliantly designed device fits seamlessly around your neck – and into your daily routine. Say goodbye to bulky headphones and tangled wires. And say hello to the ultimate audio experience as you SET SOUND FREE with ROPES USA.





The Bluetooth-enabled earphones feature a fully-integrated amplifier and audio equalizer that can be easily and quickly customized using the ROAM EQ mobile app. By allowing users to adjust audio frequencies in their ROPES, ROAM EQ empowers listeners to declare audio independence from the tyranny of the standard “one sound fits all” listening experience. Customize your sound based on how you want to hear it. Or use the pre-set functions on ROAM EQ to hear your favorite music the way each individual artist intended it to be heard, felt, lived, and loved. 






For You:
ROAM and ROPES USA were created not only for U.S. Olympians and U.S. service men and women, but for each and every American who loves and appreciates music. Our goal is not just to develop and market the world’s greatest wireless, wearable earphones – but to reintroduce the world to the fine art of sound. To accomplish these lofty goals, we need your support. Not just to fund our efforts, but to spread the word and share the sweet sounds (and look and feel) of ROPES USA. We’ve completed the design and testing for ROPES USA, and are heading into the manufacturing phase. This period includes final testing and evaluation, packaging, and final product validation. Manufacturing costs of our world-class and innovative earphones are extremely high. We need your help to make it through this phase. If this sounds good to you, we’ve got even more music to your ears. We’re offering a wide array of fantastic giveaways to donors of various levels.







 For USA Olympians:
Inspired by and created for elite U.S.A. athletes, the ROPES USA project was launched in January 2016. ROAM founder Steven Lamar created this special patriotic edition of his popular ROPES earphones because of his admiration for Olympians.  Throughout his life, Steven has drawn motivation from Olympians' perseverance, strength and commitment to excellence.  He set out to create a USA-themed version of ROPES earphones to honor the athletes that inspire him.  
Steven’s vision was to leverage the superior audio experience and personalization abilities of the world’s most powerful wireless earphones – into a sporty, sleek, cool, colorful version of ROPES. ROPES USA will be worn and rocked by U.S.A. athletes in Brazil this summer. By participating in this fundraising campaign, you can proudly don your own pair. It’s the next best thing to hanging an Olympic medal around your neck. 







For Stand Up To Cancer: 
Elite-level athletes weren’t the only inspiration for ROPES. Deeply impacted by the tragedy of losing his late-wife Jennifer to brain cancer, Steven created ROPES to blend his expertise in audio with a desire to make mobile devices safer to use.   In memory of Jennifer, ROAM will donate $5,000 to Stand Up To Cancer upon the completion of this campaign. Please note that no funds raised through this campaign will be used to fund this donation.  If you would like to learn more about Steven's personal story and his commitment to raising funds for cancer research, please read his letter in the ""Updates"" section of this campaign.










 







Artist Sound Signatures:
Sound is a musician’s art form, but today’s ordinary earphones only allow listeners to hear music one way – the way the audio engineers decide for you. We value the art of music. And the unique talent it takes to create it. So we created a premium mobile audio platform to reproduce sound that’s true to the artist’s intention. And we partnered with new and established artists alike to create their own unique Artist Sound Signatures for ROAM and USA ROPES users. Starting in the fall of 2016, ROAM users can download an Artist Sound Signature directly to their ROAM EQ app – connecting them to the artist and their recordings in a way that has never been heard or felt before.





 Superior Sound:
We all hear differently, and no one sound fits all listeners. The ROAM EQ Companion App liberates listeners from the tyranny of the ordinary “one sound fits all” experience. It empowers music lovers like you to control the EQ in your USA ROPES via Bluetooth – and to customize the sound as you desire for the music you love. ROAM EQ also features pre-set EQ’s for various musical genres – offering a quick and easy path to audio customization.





 Creative Design:
ROPES USA were designed by San Francisco-based Astro Studios. For more than 20 years, Astro has helped companies like Nike, Xbox, Neff Watches, and The Art of Shaving make stuff that people love. Wearable. Functional. Simple. Different. ROPES USA is all of this and more. You wear it around your neck, like a piece of jewelry. It’s always there when you want it. And it looks great when you don’t need it.





 
Comfortable Fit:
The angle, fit, and seal of the capsule in your ear is critical to comfort and sound quality. The ROPES USA ear capsule fit was engineered by Knowles, a 65-year-old company dedicated to performance audio in consumer electronics – and best known for miniature microphone and receiver technology for the hearing-impaired. These guys know a lot about earphones. We leverage their incredible data, insight, and experience to bring you the best fit and feel.

Using stereo output you can hook Pisound to any mixer, speakers or just plug in your headphones. Volume and Gain levels can be controlled using on-board knobs.

By default, using The Button you can open patches straight from a USB thumb drive, safely close them, shut down the Raspberry Pi and even launch “pisound” Wi-Fi hotspot, so that you can connect to the device via SSH, VNC or send WiFi-MIDI messages directly to your Pi using a smartphone or tablet.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our favorite use-case for it - you can run your <a href=""https://puredata.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pure Data</a> patches, without any need to connect a display, keyboard or mouse, just by plugging in a USB drive containing “main.pd” file, any optional MIDI controller / keyboard, click The Button once and Voilà!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;padding:5px;color: darkgray;""><small>* Triple-click WiFi hotspot works with Raspberry Pi 3 &amp; Zero W out of the box.

Some of the design options we’ve explored before was using the Raspberry Pi’s UART (RX/TX) pins directly for MIDI interface implementation, however we found that the MIDI 31250bps baud rate is not considered standard in Linux world, achieving it required tinkering with kernel configurations, depended on the CPU frequency, and methods to achieve serial communication using the MIDI baud rate were changing over time. A long term and reliable solution for this was needed, so we came up with the current solution that uses the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and a translator microcontroller for the MIDI interface.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, we went through multiple power supply designs. For example in the previous revisions we used to have an external power connector. Thanks to the feedback from our beta testers, we found out that for them to get the right power adapter is going to be tricky and expensive compared to using official and highly available Raspberry Pi USB adapter. We adjusted our design and now Pisound is powered straight from the Raspberry Pi board itself. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Currently we’re at the point where Pisound has reached a mature and stable state, successfully went through a beta test program, conforms to Raspberry Pi’s Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) specifications and is ready to reach the wider audience.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/campaign/pisound-case.png"" src=""""/></p><p><small style=""text-align: justify;padding:5px;color: darkgray;"">3D-printable case specially designed for Pisound.

The <a href=""https://github.com/BlokasLabs/pisound/blob/master/pisound-btn/pisound-btn.c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pisound-btn daemon</a>, which runs in the background, monitors and reacts to The Button. It uses next to no CPU time, as it executes instructions only when it receives interrupts raised by the kernel when the voltage level on the GPIO pin controlled by The Button position changes.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thanks to the daemon, The Button triggers shell scripts when performing the following actions: single clicking; double clicking; triple clicking; holding the button down. The default scripts for the actions respectively do: start a Pure Data patch from connected USB drive; safely stop the patch and prepare the USB drive for removal; toggles WiFi Hotspot mode; safely shuts down the device.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/campaign/h-audio.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/campaign/thd.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""padding:5px;""><small style=""text-align: justify;padding:5px;color: darkgray;""><strong>Figure 1. </strong> Response of the sine signal fed to loop-backed (digital→DAC→ADC→digital) Pisound showing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 110 dB.

The device exceeds HD-Audio standards thanks to its linear bit depth of 24 bits and maximum sample rate of 192 kHz.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Even though audio converters and other chips have a pretty good power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) on their own, to ensure low-noise operation in the vicinity of an electrically noisy Raspberry Pi computer, any power line going to the analog stuff is coupled via low dropout regulators (LDO’s) which filters any digital interference out. This design enables Pisound to be graded as a high-fidelity (Hi-Fi) audio device. For example a Hi-Fi device is expected to have the Total Harmonic Distortion value (THD) less than 1% and the Pisound has it less than 0.05% (fig. 1). That means that you can daisy-chain 20 Pisound boards and the chain would still be considered as a high-fidelity device!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We also measured the audio bandwidth of the device and as you can see (fig. 2) it is as flat as a proper table and shows -3dB high-pass and low-pass roll-off at 7.5Hz and 23kHz accordingly.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another nice feature is a clip-LED - it will light up whenever the signal at the ADC input is too high and the gain should be lowered. Please see the specs table below for additional specifications of the device.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/campaign/h-midi.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To satisfy your MIDI communication needs, Pisound has 3 options: DIN-5 Input and Output MIDI ports with activity LEDs, WiFi-MIDI and USB-MIDI via Raspberry Pi’s USB ports. Unlike usual MIDI solutions for Raspberry Pi, serial DIN-5 MIDI on Pisound is implemented using high speed SPI and a dedicated microcontroller for translating SPI data to serial MIDI byte streams and it's readily recognized in audio software as an ALSA MIDI device. The loopback latency of MIDI was measured to be 2.105ms. The two MIDI activity LEDs blink based on the flow of MIDI events.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, Pisound lets you take advantage of WiFi-MIDI. When WiFi Hotspot mode is enabled via triple clicking The Button, touchosc2midi daemon gets launched. It translates OSC messages to MIDI events so you can control audio software running on Raspberry Pi from your smartphone or tablet.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">And of course you can use USB-MIDI devices as usual by connecting them to Raspberry Pi USB ports.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also if you'd like to add some specific controls to your Pisound audio project, you can easily make your own custom MIDI controller.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/campaign/diy-midi-ctrl.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;padding:5px;color: darkgray;""><small>Arduino sketch code and more information available <a href=""https://github.com/BlokasLabs/usbmidi/tree/master/arduino/libraries/usbmidi/examples/midictrl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</small></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/campaign/h-specs.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Audio</strong></p><table style=""margin:0 auto;width: 100%;font-size: 20px;"">

Equipped with 192kHz 24-bit stereo input and output driven by the legendary Burr-Brown chips, classic MIDI In and Out ports, user-customizable button and bundled software tools, this little board is an all-around solution for your Raspberry Pi based audio projects. ASK.AUDIO, SYNTHTOPIA, SONICSTATE,RASPBERRY PI WEEKLY, MUSICTECH,MUSICRADAR, HACKADAY, GEARNEWS, ADSRSOUNDS, PALMSOUNDS, PIPOD, SOUNDGEARS,GEEKY-GADGETS, SOUNDIUM,WWWHATSNEW, FABCROSS,EVERPI, ROOT.CZ,NEWATLAS  “If you currently use or plan to use Raspberry Pi for any audio/MIDI-based work or projects, and you need a quick, easy, and affordable solution for high quality and low latency audio, Pisound is the answer, and I thoroughly recommend it.” - Liam Lacey, ASK.AUDIO(You can find the full review here)“If you’re experimenting with Pure Data or any other Linux audio toy, this could be a useful addition to your Pi stack.” - Brian Benchoff, HACKADAY  “The Blokas Pisound board looks exactly like the Raspberry Pi soundcard Sonic Pi has been dreaming about: Quality Audio/MIDI In & Out” - Sam Aaron, SONIC PI “Audio quality is very good. All my old problems of noise caused by bad cheap sound cards are gone.” - Tomme, BETA-TESTER Pisound mounts directly onto Raspberry Pi via its 40-pin header, no additional power adapter, cables or soldering is required. Just use included spacers and screws to fasten it. After that, simply power up your Raspberry Pi, wait for it to boot, connect it to the Internet and enter a few commands in a terminal window:wget http://blokas.io/pisound/install-pisound.sh -O install-pisound.shchmod +x install-pisound.sh./install-pisound.shAnd that's it. Done. Thank You! Now you can choose pisound as your main sound card through native Volume widget and use it with any Linux Audio/MIDI software. Pisound allows you to connect a huge variety of different types of audio-related gear. Thanks to the design of stereo input with wide-range gain control, you can connect audio sources ranging from your bass guitar to a CD player or your modular synth. Using stereo output you can hook Pisound to any mixer, speakers or just plug in your headphones. Volume and Gain levels can be controlled using on-board knobs. For MIDI connectivity you also have a lot of options - MIDI In/Out through on-board DIN-5 sockets, USB-MIDI via Pi's USB ports or even WiFi-MIDI! When we were designing Pisound one of the main goals was to empower everyone to use Pisound and Raspberry Pi in headless mode - without an external monitor, keyboard or mouse. As it turns out, one button, is all you need to achieve this. We call it The Button. It single-handedly allows to perform multiple forms of interactions, such as single click, double click, triple click and hold.Its functionality can be customized according to your needs. By default, using The Button you can open patches straight from a USB thumb drive, safely close them, shut down the Raspberry Pi and even launch “pisound” Wi-Fi hotspot, so that you can connect to the device via SSH, VNC or send WiFi-MIDI messages directly to your Pi using a smartphone or tablet.Our favorite use-case for it - you can run your Pure Data patches, without any need to connect a display, keyboard or mouse, just by plugging in a USB drive containing “main.pd” file, any optional MIDI controller / keyboard, click The Button once and Voilà!* Triple-click WiFi hotspot works with Raspberry Pi 3 & Zero W out of the box. Other versions require SoftAP capable USB WiFi adapter to be plugged in. Make Your Own InstrumentPisound in combination with Raspberry Pi provides you an easy and quick way to create your own instrument, e.g. digital synthesizer, effects unit, groovebox or sampler. You can use LV2 plugins, SuperCollider, Pure Data, Sonic Pi or any other Linux compatible audio application to take care of the software side of things and Pisound will do the rest.The fastest way to create your own thing is to use Pure Data. Pure Data is a real-time graphical programming environment for audio and video that lets you generate and process audio signals in many different and magical ways. You can find pre-made patches on PatchStorage, write one of them to a USB drive, plug it into your Raspberry Pi, click the Pisound’s button once and enjoy! And if you want to get your hands dirty you can create your own patches too!Liam Lacey from Ask.Audio shows how it goes. You can find his full review here. Live Coding Jam-SessionSam Aaron used Pisound for his Sonic Pi presentation and jam-session at this years' Raspberry Pi birthday party. Both the Guitar and Synth are connected to the stereo input of Pisound.  Glove Controlled Voice Augmenter Tomme, one of our beta-testers, used Pisound to finish his prototype of a glove controlled voice augmenter. The glove is made using Arduino, 2 buttons, 4 flex sensors, 1 XYZ accelerometer and Bluetooth transmitter. Pure Data is responsible for the sound processing. Audiophile Network PlayerUsing Raspberry Pi + Pisound + Volumio/RuneAudio you can build your own Hi-Fi network player. Just connect it to your home stereo system and control it using any device running a web browser. You can find project instructions here. Recording StudioPisound works great with Audacity - an open source, cross-platform audio software for multi-track recording and editing, so you can start recording your creations with just a few clicks. Your Own Internet Radio StationHave you ever dreamed to have your own radio station? Now you can! You just need to use Pisound, darkice and icecast with your Raspberry Pi. You can find project instructions here. Meet Blokas Team - Justinas (guy in the tree), Giedrius (the one in the sky), Jatas (guy with the glasses), Šarūnas (the one that sings), Aida (the smiling one) and the one on a boat is Pranciškus. We love to make things and we love to talk about them, so if you have any questions, you can ask us in the comment section, on our community forums or even chat with us here!If your question is more technical one, you can have a look at Pisound's documentation page here. Over the past 18 months we went through 6 different hardware revisions until we have arrived at the current design. Some of the design options we’ve explored before was using the Raspberry Pi’s UART (RX/TX) pins directly for MIDI interface implementation, however we found that the MIDI 31250bps baud rate is not considered standard in Linux world, achieving it required tinkering with kernel configurations, depended on the CPU frequency, and methods to achieve serial communication using the MIDI baud rate were changing over time. A long term and reliable solution for this was needed, so we came up with the current solution that uses the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and a translator microcontroller for the MIDI interface.In addition, we went through multiple power supply designs. For example in the previous revisions we used to have an external power connector. Thanks to the feedback from our beta testers, we found out that for them to get the right power adapter is going to be tricky and expensive compared to using official and highly available Raspberry Pi USB adapter. We adjusted our design and now Pisound is powered straight from the Raspberry Pi board itself. Currently we’re at the point where Pisound has reached a mature and stable state, successfully went through a beta test program, conforms to Raspberry Pi’s Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) specifications and is ready to reach the wider audience.3D-printable case specially designed for Pisound. You can find all the necessary files here. Pisound is compatible with virtually all Linux distributions and software as it comes with an ALSA audio and MIDI driver integrated in mainline Raspbian Linux kernel (ver. 4.4.27+). The pisound-btn daemon, which runs in the background, monitors and reacts to The Button. It uses next to no CPU time, as it executes instructions only when it receives interrupts raised by the kernel when the voltage level on the GPIO pin controlled by The Button position changes.Thanks to the daemon, The Button triggers shell scripts when performing the following actions: single clicking; double clicking; triple clicking; holding the button down. The default scripts for the actions respectively do: start a Pure Data patch from connected USB drive; safely stop the patch and prepare the USB drive for removal; toggles WiFi Hotspot mode; safely shuts down the device. Figure 1.  Response of the sine signal fed to loop-backed (digital→DAC→ADC→digital) Pisound showing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 110 dB. Calculated Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is less than 0.05%.Figure 2. Frequency response of the white noise fed to loop-backed (digital→DAC→ADC→digital) Pisound showing the bandwidth (BW) of the device and how it is estimated.The legendary Burr-Brown Op-Amps, ADC and DAC chips are brought together on this little board to exhibit clean signal amplification and conversion between digital and analog realms. The device exceeds HD-Audio standards thanks to its linear bit depth of 24 bits and maximum sample rate of 192 kHz.Even though audio converters and other chips have a pretty good power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) on their own, to ensure low-noise operation in the vicinity of an electrically noisy Raspberry Pi computer, any power line going to the analog stuff is coupled via low dropout regulators (LDO’s) which filters any digital interference out. This design enables Pisound to be graded as a high-fidelity (Hi-Fi) audio device. For example a Hi-Fi device is expected to have the Total Harmonic Distortion value (THD) less than 1% and the Pisound has it less than 0.05% (fig. 1). That means that you can daisy-chain 20 Pisound boards and the chain would still be considered as a high-fidelity device!We also measured the audio bandwidth of the device and as you can see (fig. 2) it is as flat as a proper table and shows -3dB high-pass and low-pass roll-off at 7.5Hz and 23kHz accordingly.Another nice feature is a clip-LED - it will light up whenever the signal at the ADC input is too high and the gain should be lowered. Please see the specs table below for additional specifications of the device. To satisfy your MIDI communication needs, Pisound has 3 options: DIN-5 Input and Output MIDI ports with activity LEDs, WiFi-MIDI and USB-MIDI via Raspberry Pi’s USB ports. Unlike usual MIDI solutions for Raspberry Pi, serial DIN-5 MIDI on Pisound is implemented using high speed SPI and a dedicated microcontroller for translating SPI data to serial MIDI byte streams and it's readily recognized in audio software as an ALSA MIDI device. The loopback latency of MIDI was measured to be 2.105ms. The two MIDI activity LEDs blink based on the flow of MIDI events.In addition, Pisound lets you take advantage of WiFi-MIDI. When WiFi Hotspot mode is enabled via triple clicking The Button, touchosc2midi daemon gets launched. It translates OSC messages to MIDI events so you can control audio software running on Raspberry Pi from your smartphone or tablet.And of course you can use USB-MIDI devices as usual by connecting them to Raspberry Pi USB ports.Also if you'd like to add some specific controls to your Pisound audio project, you can easily make your own custom MIDI controller.Arduino sketch code and more information available here. Audio

At this point Pisound is fully developed and ready to go, so there will be no unexpected hardware or software design issues that could cause any delay to start the production and we know that we will be able to deliver the project as planned.We can identify one risk though that we, as any other hardware developer, could face - sourcing of the necessary parts and custom components. Unavailable parts could cause a small delay in the manufacturing process (up to a few weeks). A large quantity production has an even more likely chance of it. To be safe we have taken this into account for estimating the shipping date. Some Post-Assembly Photos by Our Manufacturer * The shipped Pisound may slightly differ from what is shown in the above media.",46.0,3,"1 Campaign

</div></div></div></div>","You hear the world in complex 3D space. But most recorded sound you hear is in simple stereo. You can hear it, but it can’t be recorded which has the depth of space that you get in real life.Lifelike lets you record the complex, 3D environment of the real world in seconds. Without downloading any app, just use your iPhone, plug in and record, you can make the truly 3D video in seconds.Listen to the recordings below with headphones to hear the difference. Lifelike 3D Audio ReviewsBinaural Microphones for 3D Sound: Sennheiser Smart Headset vs Scenes LifelikeRecorded by Derrick StoryClick here for full articleClick here for full article What's 3D audio?The Lifelike 3D sound recording earphones records the complete soundscape, not only sound, which has precise direction and distance. It captures how the sound moves, where it comes from, and how the surrounding environment changes the sound with reflection, refraction, diffraction and other sound variations. When you use the headphones to play back your recording, you can easily pinpoint the variation of sound.The truly 3D video/audio records dynamic sound-field information, which contains direction, distance, and movement. The 2D recordings we are accustomed to are “head-in effect,” which means the sound is limited without direction and distance information, giving you a less all encompassing sound experience. 
With 3D sound recording, you are immersed in a panoramic experience ——you’ll be surrounded by sound just like you’re there. The sound is not just a 3D sound effect, it is true 3D sound. You can feel every precise variation in that sound-field, from a whisper, to a distant wind chime, just like you’re really there. 2D sound is flat, but 3D sound makes you feel you’re truly there in the scene.
 

The Lifelike 3D earphone is the most convenient in-ear 3D audio recording product for iPhone. It’s the world's first portable 3D recording earphone and a binaural recording product, which uses your real head, instead of a dummy head, for immersive recordings.

Proprietary HRTF optimized algorithm
Analog to digital signal conversion
Sound-field Mix, Auto Gain, EQ Compensation Included


Binaural recording simulates real sound as a human hears it. Lifelike is adapted to this theory with customized “shark gill” earbuds that are perfectly airtight, helping Lifelike 3D earphone capture even the slightest changes in spatial audio. The Digital Box has a maximum 44.1kHz/16bit decoding ability that outputs integrated immersive audio/video for multiple production usage.
Lifelike comes with an earphone and a digital box. Based on the “Dummy Head Record” and “HRTF” theory, Lifelike made by a mimic human acoustic system which uses two microphones in the left and right ear. The patent “Shark Gill” guarantees airtightness and comfort. The digital box has a built-in best-in-class processor with proprietary decoding algorithms to output 16bit/44.1kHz lossless high-fidelity audio. It comes with -32dB high mic sensitivity and 110dB SNR as well as wide-range frequency. Based on HRTF theory and its proprietary algorithms, it reproduces the natural environment sound-field. Lifelike captures 3D sound true to distance and direction, recording the subtleties of how the sound moves, where it comes from, and how the surrounding environment changes the sound through reflection, refraction, diffraction and all the variations. After recording, DSP in the Digital Box converts the analog signal to digital through Scenes HRTF optimized proprietary algorithm, including sound-field mix, auto gain, and EQ compensation. The final 3D audio will save to your iPhone, and you can share with anyone to make them feel like they’re really there.

Based on HRTF, Lifelike imitates the way human ears hear in the natural world bye recording immersive 3D audio with directions, distances and movement tracks. Instead of dummy head structure, Scenes Lifelike can be directly placed on your real head to record and perfectly reproduce REALISTIC & IMMERSIVE audio. This technique is the first of its kind.

Scenes Lifelike uses the iPhone to charge and is equipped with a built-in power save mode for lower battery consumption.

Recordings are directly saved in iPhone storage without any other SD card, and once recorded, can be shared instantly.



The Scenes Lifelike earphone is also a HiFi earphone, providing the best aural  experience. It is equipped with an independent mic-integrated, lightning connection. The Shark Gill earbud adopts ergonomic design, hence the “shark” namesake, for in-ears earphone, which fits the ear canal perfectly and steadily. This earbud is airtight and steady, differentiating it from other earbuds on the market. Having considered every individual’s different auricle, each purchaser with four pairs of various sized in-ear silicon “Shark Gill” earbuds for a more customizable listening experience.

 After complete failure of the above mentioned product, I set out to design and produce a waterproof speaker of small size that would meet or exceed my expectations at a price everyone could afford.
I reached out to a friend who was already well established in the audio market.  This friend and I formed a partnership and together we began using our research and development team to develop a PCBA board that would not fail to connect and would have better range. After many long hours and several attempts, this mission was accomplished.

Order yours at tulamics.com
 The Tula is all the equipment you need to intuitively capture and record high-quality sound no matter what you’re doing.Hosting a podcast, producing digital content, or just attending work meetings from home. The Tula comes equipped with noise cancellation, plus the mic doubles as a mobile recorder.  The Tula doesn’t just have great features, the mic’s design is unmatched — a true combination  of modern and nostalgic aesthetic. Not only will you capture high-quality audio always, you’ll look great while doing it.  The Tula was designed for maximum ease and portability. Its base opens and closes with a premium feel and is detachable with a simple quarter-turn mechanism. The Tula Mic’s form factor is based on the golden ratio, allowing for maximum ease and portability.    The Tula Mic will allow you to effortlessly capture great audio. Whether you’re a content creator, a work-from-home professional or just somebody who appreciates good sound in Zoom meetings and Skype calls, the Tula could be just what you’re looking for. It’s a high quality USB mic (and so much more).  Imagine your own little recording studio in your pocket. The Tula makes that a reality. With its own internal battery and memory, the Tula Mic can give you up to 12 hours of continuous recording in high quality 16bit/48K wav format.   Not everyone has the luxury of always using a microphone in a silent environment. We teamed up with a well-known Swedish music software company to create an embedded version of their noise-reduction algorithm. With just the touch of a button, you can get rid of unwanted background noise such as fans, air conditioners or even traffic.   The Tula was designed in conjunction with Red Dot Award-winning industrial designers in Barcelona. It’s a thoroughly modern device featuring cutting-edge audio technology and yet its soft curves and solid build quality reference a bygone era.  The folks behind the Tula Mic are no strangers to the world of audio. Founder David Brown is the co-owner of Soyuz Microphones, one of the most well respected high-end microphone brands on the planet. Soyuz is the audio choice of the likes of Coldplay, Radiohead and many more. Plus Tula’s firmware, electronic and mechanical engineers have worked on the iconic OP-Z synthesizer from Teenage Engineering.   The Tula Mic features Burr Brown op amps, TI audio codecs and high performance ECMs. It has both uni and omni-directional capsules and its 3.5mm headphone jack doubles as an input for a lavalier microphone. Yet, the priority has always been to keep the Tula so frictionless and user friendly that even a child could use it. The Tula was designed with the modern content creator in mind. It’s intuitive, portable and stylish. Podcasters can use it in their studio or remotely as a mobile recorder when conducting interviews in the field.   You can use the uni-directional capsule in conjunction with a lavalier microphone plugged into the Tula’s 3.5mm jack to conduct an interview with two separate mono tracks using nothing but Tula. No computer or phone needed!   YouTubers, you can use the Tula as your primary audio source for filming videos or streaming from your computer. If you’re recording outdoors you can use the noise cancellation feature to block out any unnecessary background noises.  Or use it as a mobile recorder. With its internal battery and memory, the Tula will give you up to 12 hours of high quality recording.

He says: ""I’m just a singer who likes to imagine and draw cool products, and assemble teams who can turn them into a reality.""  Tula was well on its way to being fully funded by investors earlier this year. Then, on March 9th, the markets of the world collapsed.  We believe that the need for the Tula has only increased due to the pandemic. Your voice is more important than ever. And for many of us, our voice is what connects us to family, friends, colleagues and new opportunities. We want to carry your voice and far and wide, whether you’re recording an interview, running a meeting or documenting daily life.We believed that people would see the value in the Tula and that we would be able to raise the funds needed for our first mass production run via an engaged community on Indiegogo.  Our work continued even after the pandemic pressed pause. We’ve managed to finish virtually all of the development work through spring and summer 2020. That means folks who invest in a Tula Mic will get their microphone less than two months after the campaign ends.  This is not our first manufacturing and shipment process. It’s not even our first time producing a world-class mic (learn about our first one here).Ready to press ""play""We’re ready to start mass manufacturing the Tula Mic once we reach our funding goal. We’ve got a factory in place. Our project manager has a very close relationship with the factory and has successfully brought many hardware products to market before. We’re fully committed to delivering your Tula Mic on time, and with proper planning and safety measures, COVID-19 will have no impact on our production.What this means for youGenerally, the biggest risk for any hardware product is unknown delays in manufacturing as things can always change along the way when bringing a brand new product into the world for the first time. It’s highly unlikely that this will happen for the Tula.In the unlikely case that delays occur, rest assured we’ll disclose all information in our updates.   Return policy The Tula has undergone 2+ years of development and testing. The funds raised through Indiegogo will be used to manufacture Tula Mics for our backers. With your support, it’s ready to go.In accordance with Indiegogo Terms of Use, we will not offer refunds or return for items that are not defective. All Tula Mics come with a 12-month warranty, so in the unlikely event that you receive a faulty device, please contact us at info@tulamics.com.SustainabilityThe Tula was designed with longevity and environmental concerns in mind. All the parts either snap or screw together so that the Tula can be easily repaired and when its life is over, it can be separated into its various parts and recycled or disposed of correctly.Shipping At the end of the campaign, we’ll reach out for your shipping address. Shipping charges are estimated to be $5 standard shipping in the US, $10 to Canada, and $15 - $20 for international shipping. The charges might increase or decrease slightly.We're offering both US and international shipping. Please note we're not responsible for additional duty and taxes that may apply to your country. For US fulfillment, Tulas will first be sent via air freight from our factory in Malaysia to our fulfillment center in the US and then be shipped to US addresses. US-based backers are expected to receive rewards within 3-8 days from our fulfillment warehouse. For the rest of the world, rewards will also be sent from our fulfillment center in the US and should be expected within 4-20 days from shipping depending on the size of the delivery and your country.",57.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>POLATAP is nearly completed and we have made preliminary agreements with our manufacturers. We’re currently ramping up at our factory and ready to meet the estimated delivery times. We’ve done our very best to estimate demand and create a solid production plan, but sometimes forecasts are not able to hit the mark perfectly. In this case, we’ll let you know the reasons and correct it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We're aware of the challenges during production, packaging and shipping worldwide. However, we have top-notch advisors onboard where, with their extensive background and work experiences, we can hit the ground running. We’ll work hard and deliver you an incredible product, which has been our responsibility since the beginning of this project. We can’t wait for you guys to get your hands on the POLATAP Traveler Kit!</p>

You can practically do it in the dark or with your eyes closed.*Due to mass production feasibility issues, Battery Hub design shown in the above image have been changed to a dual USB type-C design.POLATAP has incredible flexibility when it comes to connectivity. You don't have to carry any additional accessories or cables around because POLATAP supports all connectivity options for all of your devices.    *Following is an audio sample showing effectiveness of ANC (noise cancelling earphone) earphones.                                                       
  The active noise cancelling technology works by using POLATAP Earphones together with the Bluetooth Receiver, making the Earphones incredibly lightweight and battery-free.The Bluetooth Receiver supplies the power and controls the active noise cancelling technology, and they are transmitted to the Earphones over the 3.5mm audio connection. Taking advantage of the huge battery in the Battery Hub, you can enjoy active noise cancelling for longer than one week. All you have to do is snap the Bluetooth Receiver onto the Battery Hub to charge it when you need to. The noise cancelling feature can be used for up to 12 hours without being charged by the Battery Hub, and 6 hours or less when used together with music play-back or voice calls depending on the volume of sound.  Audio transparency feature allows external sound to not just pass-through, but amplify only the sounds that you want to hear. A dedicated button is easily accessible on the Bluetooth Receiver, instantly letting you hear what's going on around you without having to take your earphones out. There’s a reason why POLATAP’s Earphones are more compact than any other active noise cancelling earphones. There are actually no batteries in the Earphones at all.Many earphones require dedicated batteries for active noise cancelling. Having to charge the earphones themselves with a separate charger can be annoying and not to mention you might lose the charging cable. However, we developed a way to send power through the earphone wires without requiring a dedicated battery for active noise cancelling.We partnered with GMK, an innovative fabless semiconductor company who provide proprietary single-wire connectivity solutions. We've achieved a battery-free noise cancelling earphones by adapting GPCI(GMK Power Communication Interface) into POLATAP’s Bluetooth Receiver. We have made a fantastic partnership with CRESYN, one of the most respected names in audio product, and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of consumer electronics. Our team has successfully achieved a superior audio quality while maintaining a compact design thanks to CRESYN’s acoustic team.We wanted to make POLATAP as affordable as possible for Indiegogo backers. For the limited Indiegogo specials, we priced POLATAP as close to the original production cost as possible. This is possible because we got rid of the middleman.We've also worked with the manufacturing factories in China to refine the production process, making them cost-efficient.And POLATAP's modular system means that there are no redundant components, basically making each product in the Traveler Kit cheaper than any other competitors in the same quality level. We've gone through multiple iterations of testing to perfect the performance of the Earphones.   Plug in the Earphones' 3.5mm audio jack into the Bluetooth Receiver. Switch on the active noise cancelling slider on the Earphones to block out the noise around you. COMPONENTS The Earphones contain a large 14.3mm driver for high-fidelity. The remote on the Earphones has volume, play/pause, and voice assistant buttons as well as a microphone and active noise cancelling power slider.  We've visited one of the noisiest, yet coolest, place on planet earth, Time Square, New York, with our Noise Cancelling Earphones. See how the people in Time Square reacted to our noise cancelling feature:

 
     3.5mm audio jacks are disappearing from smartphones, but that doesn’t mean you can’t keep using your favorite pair of wired headphones. POLATAP Bluetooth Receiver can turn any wired headphones or speakers into a wireless device, letting you stream your music wirelessly. The Bluetooth Receiver also comes with a metal clip accessory for clipping onto your shirt or pocket, so you can listen to music without getting your wires tangled. In any rental or privately-owned car, plug the Bluetooth Receiver into the 3.5mm audio plug to hear everything that goes on in your smartphone through your car stereo: navigation, music, or hands-free calling. No setup or additional pairing required.You can even use your favorite hi-fi speakers in your home or office. Just plug and play.  1. Snap the Bluetooth Receiver and metal clip accessory together.2. Plug in your audio via 3.5mm audio plug.3. Pair the Bluetooth Receiver with a device source like your smartphone.4.

</div></div>","Combining portability with audiophile-grade sound—UPstage360 has it all! UPstage360 upgrades you from sweet spots to a 360° sweet zone, projecting output evenly in an omnidirectional soundstage so you can hear the same Hi-Res audio from anywhere in the room.Unlike conventional speakers that deliver directional output, chaining listeners to a limited area of sweet spots, UPstage360 creates consistent, high-quality sound regardless of where you stand.It accomplishes this through a patented ball-cone reflection structure made of aluminum alloy. This creates optimized reflection curves that radiate consistent sound waves while avoiding interference with different frequency ranges.
