</div></div>","Our Story
The Travel Yoga Project was born from a passion for yoga, travel, music, art, and the desire to make a difference.After living abroad teaching English at a shelter in South Africa, I traveled to Thailand to complete my thesis on gender inequality and human trafficking. Through these experiences, I was inspired to found an organization committed to creatively addressing the tragedy and violence that exists throughout the world today. 

The Travel Yoga Project is dedicated to a global effort to spread the joy of yoga to local populations. Our organization will use yoga as a tool for creating change from the inside out, from the ground up. We will use the art of yoga to empower people to heal, find their voice, discover their passion, and rise up to create change within their own communities! 
 
We will be launching the Travel Yoga Project with a trip to Indonesia this May. In Indonesia we will work in orphanages, shelters, and birthing clinics to share the transformative practice of yoga. Through yoga we will  build safe relationships, offer stimulating & soulful yoga classes, and provide teacher training to teenagers living in the orphanages. 

Beyond yoga, we full heartedly believe in the capacity of art and music to both inspire and generate awareness. With a fusion of photography, writing, film and music, we aspire to share the portraits of the human spirit illuminated along our journey, and our message of empowerment, unity, and unconditional love! T.Y.P. is not just for yoga lovers, but for all art, music travel, people, and plain life fanatics, moved by the pursuit of innovative ways to motivate social activism. 

You can follow our journey to Indonesia on www.travelyogaproject.wordpress.com

The Impact
Because yoga can be done anywhere, anytime, by anyone, it is an extremely effective, practical, and free tool for establishing personal growth and social change. Our hope is that the yoga we teach abroad will be a valuable instrument that will continue to foster healing and make waves long after we leave! 
 
What We Need & What You Get
Our work abroad is 100% volunteer and 100% of donations will be used to launch our project and cover a portion of the expenses of working at the orphanages, shelters, and birthing clinics. We will also provide yoga mats, as well as educational materials to ensure that our students can continue practicing after our departure. 

Currently, the project is entirely personally funded. Help us reach our goal of $3,000 dollars and make our efforts a greater success!

Out of extreme love for all of our supporters, we will be offering some fun perks as a thank you to each of you for donating. Receive framed photographs, T.Y.P. stickers, T.Y.P. t-shirts, 100 % recycled handmade Indonesian bags, handmade mala bracelets, and Indonesian music cd's!

<p>English: Please see below.</p>
<p>Français: Voir ci-dessous.</p>
<h2>Español</h2>
<p>Hace dos años la comunidad de Grand Boukan se organizó para hacer un regalo a sus niños y niñas: comenzó a funcionar la Escuela Comunitaria de Bassin Thomas.  Desde ese entonces, este pequeño proyecto que comenzó con menos de 30 niños ha cuadriplicado su matrícula y se ha convertido en la única posibilidad en la zona de obtener una educación básica.</p>
<p>Pero con los nuevos logros, nuevos retos también aparecen, entre éstos lograr la sostenibilidad a largo plazo del espacio. Nos enfrentamos a una falta de fondos y tenemos que hacer algo por los niños y las niñas de Grand Boukan. Y como dice el pueblo haitiano, “pitì pitì”, poco a poco, paso a paso nos dirigimos hacia esa meta.</p>
<h3>Conoce la idea.</h3>
<p>“Queremos ayudar”… pero ¿qué significa ayudar a alguien? ¿Cómo se ayuda a alguien? Podemos dar educación, comida, salud y diversión, pero ¿es eso suficiente? La nación africana Igbo tiene un dicho: “Ora na-azu nwa”, se necesita una aldea para criar un niño. Desde este proyecto, creemos en el rol de la aldea y la comunidad.</p>
<p><em>Noumenm</em> es una palabra en Criollo Haitiano que significa a la vez “nosotros” y “vosotros”. Dentro de la expresión no hay diferencia alguna, sino que es el contexto el que otorga un significado sobre el otro. Así, cuando en Criollo Haitiano hablo de “ustedes”, perfectamente podría estar hablando de “nosotros”.</p>
<p><em>Noumenm</em> es también el nombre de nuestro proyecto, una apuesta en donde el <em>nosotros </em>y el <em>ustedes</em> se difumina, se mezcla, y crea algo diferente. Desde hace un año estamos trabajando con la comunidad de Grand Boukan para potenciar procesos de desarrollo gestionados por líderes locales. Alguna de las cosas que hemos realizado:</p>
<ul>
<li>El proyecto <em>Noumenm</em> participó en la I Incubadora de Ideas de la Fundación Melton, en el contexto de su “Global Citizenship Celebration” en Alemania. Esta idea fue elegida por los participantes y expertos del evento por sobre otros proyectos internacionales, recibiendo apoyo tanto en recursos para la implementación programática, como en la supervisión, diseño y reformulación del proyecto.</li>
<li>Se gestionaron los recursos para la compra del terreno de la escuela comunitaria de Grand Boukan, permitiendo así llegar a un primer paso hacia la sostenibilidad del proyecto.</li>
<li>Respondiendo a un brote de cólera, se habilitó un Punto de Rehidratación Oral y se capacitó a voluntarios comunitarios, quienes atendieron a no sólo gente de la comunidad, sino también de otras comunidades cercanas, controlando así la emergencia y reduciendo las fatalidades.</li>
</ul><p>Además de la Fundación Melton, <em>Noumenm</em> cuenta con el apoyo de la Fundación América Solidaria, quienes han apoyado tanto en apoyar la logística de ciertas actividades, como también co-facilitado uno de nuestros trabajos, específicamente el Punto de Rehidratación Oral.</p>
<h3>¿Qué necesitamos?</h3>
<p>Necesitamos pagar a los docentes que día a día acompañan a los estudiantes de Grand Boukan, y que han postergado su salario para el funcionamiento de la escuela. También necesitamos contar con los insumos mínimos para continuar impartiendo las clases. En los adjuntos puedes encontrar un presupuesto detallado.</p>
<h3>¿Para qué?</h3>
<p>Asegurar el funcionamiento de este año escolar nos permite así centrar todos los esfuerzos de la comunidad en la búsqueda de alternativas sostenibles para el próximo año escolar, integrando esfuerzos de la comunidad, las instancias gubernamentales y/o los apoyos de otras organizaciones.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Porque el primer paso se ha dado: La comunidad cuenta con un espacio físico para la escuela, ahora todos juntos podemos contribuir para este espacio continúe alimentándose de vida e historias gracias a la vitalidad de los estudiantes; porque seguir soñando entre todos en oportunidades educativas para niños, niñas, adolescentes y jóvenes nos permitirá construir nuevas opciones para el presente y el futuro; y porque no nos falla la esperanza y tenemos la capacidad de hacer más.</p>
<h3>¿Qué buscamos?</h3>
<p>El apoyo de personas como tú, que desde la distancia o en la cercanía quieran jugársela y apostar por la educación, el pueblo haitiano y la comunidad de Grand Boukan.</p>
<h3>¿Cómo puedes apoyar?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Nou fínanse nou</em>: donando por medio electrónico a la campaña. Todo el dinero recolectado irá directamente a pagar los gastos de funcionamiento de la escuela.</li>
<li>
<em>Nou patajè istwa nou: </em>Compartiendo esta iniciativa entre tus contactos para que entre todas y todos logremos que nuevas personas puedan sumarse, conocer a la comunidad y compartir nuestro sueño.</li>
<li>
<em>Nou ba nou konesans nou: </em>Compartiendo con tu conocimiento y experiencia, apóyanos con ideas y estrategias que puedan facilitar la sostenibilidad de la Escuela Comunitaria de Bassin Thomas.</li>
<li>
<em>Nou konnèn yon moun k ap edè nou: </em>Facilitando posibles contactos que nos puedan permitir acercarnos a la meta planteada y a que la comunidad continúe la construcción de la escuela de Gran Boukan.</li>
</ul><h3>Y si en dos meses no logramos la meta… ¿Qué pasaría?</h3>
<p><em>Noumenm</em> <em>tèt ansanm </em>(nosotros/vosotros juntando esfuerzos) alcanzaremos la meta! Pero si algo ocurriera… Todos los fondos que hayan sido recaudados serán utilizados para cubrir las necesidades básicas requeridas para el funcionamiento del Escuela, empezando por los insumos requeridos para poder seguir impartiendo las clases en Grand Boukan.</p>
<h3>Durante y después de la campaña ¿Qué pasará?</h3>
<p>Desde ahora la comunidad de Gran Boukan y Noumenm estamos diseñando alternativas de mediano y largo plazo que permitan que la escuela por sí misma sea sostenible para la implementación del próximo año escolar.</p>
<p>Te invitamos a ser parte de esta historia que construimos al andar. Recuerda revisar a la derecha los <em>ti kadò</em> (pequeños obsequios) que hemos preparado para quienes nos ayuden.</p>
<h2>English</h2>
<p>Two years ago the Grand Boukan community organized itself to make a gift for its children: the Bassin Thomas Community School began operating. And from this day on, this small community project which started with less than 30 children has quadrupled its enrollment and has become one of the few opportunities to get elementary education in the area.</p>
<p>But with these new achievements new challenges emerged as well, like achieving long-term sustainability. The school faces a lack of funding and,the community all of us, Noumenm and yourselves, have to do something for the boys and girls in Grand Boukan. And as the Haitian people say, “pitì pitì”, little by little we will move forward to rise over the challenges.</p>
<h3>Meet the idea.</h3>
<p>“We want to help”… But, what it is to help someone? How do you really help someone? We can provide education, food, health and entertainment, but is that enough? The Igbo people have a saying: “Ora na-azu nwa”, it takes a village to raise a child. With this project, we make a commitment to believe in this ‘village’ and its community.</p>
<p>Noumenm is a Haitian Creole word that means “ourselves” and “yourselves” at the same time. The expression doesn’t make any difference in itself, but it is the context that provides with the particular meaning. So, when we talk about “you” in Haitian Creole, we might as well be talking about “us”.</p>
<p>Noumenm is also the name of our project, a gamble in which the “us” and “you” gets blurry, they mix and create something different. For over a year we’ve been working with the Grand Boukan community to strengthen development processes managed by local leaders. Some of the things we did during 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project participated in the 1st Melton Foundation Global Citizenship Celebration / Idea Incubator, in Jena, Germany.

Español
Hace dos años la comunidad de Grand Boukan se organizó para hacer un regalo a sus niños y niñas: comenzó a funcionar la Escuela Comunitaria de Bassin Thomas.  Desde ese entonces, este pequeño proyecto que comenzó con menos de 30 niños ha cuadriplicado su matrícula y se ha convertido en la única posibilidad en la zona de obtener una educación básica.
Pero con los nuevos logros, nuevos retos también aparecen, entre éstos lograr la sostenibilidad a largo plazo del espacio. Nos enfrentamos a una falta de fondos y tenemos que hacer algo por los niños y las niñas de Grand Boukan. Y como dice el pueblo haitiano, “pitì pitì”, poco a poco, paso a paso nos dirigimos hacia esa meta.
Conoce la idea.
“Queremos ayudar”… pero ¿qué significa ayudar a alguien? ¿Cómo se ayuda a alguien? Podemos dar educación, comida, salud y diversión, pero ¿es eso suficiente? La nación africana Igbo tiene un dicho: “Ora na-azu nwa”, se necesita una aldea para criar un niño. Desde este proyecto, creemos en el rol de la aldea y la comunidad.
Noumenm es una palabra en Criollo Haitiano que significa a la vez “nosotros” y “vosotros”. Dentro de la expresión no hay diferencia alguna, sino que es el contexto el que otorga un significado sobre el otro. Así, cuando en Criollo Haitiano hablo de “ustedes”, perfectamente podría estar hablando de “nosotros”.
Noumenm es también el nombre de nuestro proyecto, una apuesta en donde el nosotros y el ustedes se difumina, se mezcla, y crea algo diferente. Desde hace un año estamos trabajando con la comunidad de Grand Boukan para potenciar procesos de desarrollo gestionados por líderes locales. Alguna de las cosas que hemos realizado:

El proyecto Noumenm participó en la I Incubadora de Ideas de la Fundación Melton, en el contexto de su “Global Citizenship Celebration” en Alemania. Esta idea fue elegida por los participantes y expertos del evento por sobre otros proyectos internacionales, recibiendo apoyo tanto en recursos para la implementación programática, como en la supervisión, diseño y reformulación del proyecto.
Se gestionaron los recursos para la compra del terreno de la escuela comunitaria de Grand Boukan, permitiendo así llegar a un primer paso hacia la sostenibilidad del proyecto.
Respondiendo a un brote de cólera, se habilitó un Punto de Rehidratación Oral y se capacitó a voluntarios comunitarios, quienes atendieron a no sólo gente de la comunidad, sino también de otras comunidades cercanas, controlando así la emergencia y reduciendo las fatalidades.
Además de la Fundación Melton, Noumenm cuenta con el apoyo de la Fundación América Solidaria, quienes han apoyado tanto en apoyar la logística de ciertas actividades, como también co-facilitado uno de nuestros trabajos, específicamente el Punto de Rehidratación Oral.
¿Qué necesitamos?
Necesitamos pagar a los docentes que día a día acompañan a los estudiantes de Grand Boukan, y que han postergado su salario para el funcionamiento de la escuela. También necesitamos contar con los insumos mínimos para continuar impartiendo las clases. En los adjuntos puedes encontrar un presupuesto detallado.
¿Para qué?
Asegurar el funcionamiento de este año escolar nos permite así centrar todos los esfuerzos de la comunidad en la búsqueda de alternativas sostenibles para el próximo año escolar, integrando esfuerzos de la comunidad, las instancias gubernamentales y/o los apoyos de otras organizaciones.
¿Por qué?
Porque el primer paso se ha dado: La comunidad cuenta con un espacio físico para la escuela, ahora todos juntos podemos contribuir para este espacio continúe alimentándose de vida e historias gracias a la vitalidad de los estudiantes; porque seguir soñando entre todos en oportunidades educativas para niños, niñas, adolescentes y jóvenes nos permitirá construir nuevas opciones para el presente y el futuro; y porque no nos falla la esperanza y tenemos la capacidad de hacer más.
¿Qué buscamos?
El apoyo de personas como tú, que desde la distancia o en la cercanía quieran jugársela y apostar por la educación, el pueblo haitiano y la comunidad de Grand Boukan.
¿Cómo puedes apoyar?


Nou fínanse nou: donando por medio electrónico a la campaña. Todo el dinero recolectado irá directamente a pagar los gastos de funcionamiento de la escuela.

Nou patajè istwa nou: Compartiendo esta iniciativa entre tus contactos para que entre todas y todos logremos que nuevas personas puedan sumarse, conocer a la comunidad y compartir nuestro sueño.

Nou ba nou konesans nou: Compartiendo con tu conocimiento y experiencia, apóyanos con ideas y estrategias que puedan facilitar la sostenibilidad de la Escuela Comunitaria de Bassin Thomas.

Nou konnèn yon moun k ap edè nou: Facilitando posibles contactos que nos puedan permitir acercarnos a la meta planteada y a que la comunidad continúe la construcción de la escuela de Gran Boukan.
Y si en dos meses no logramos la meta… ¿Qué pasaría?
Noumenm tèt ansanm (nosotros/vosotros juntando esfuerzos) alcanzaremos la meta! Pero si algo ocurriera… Todos los fondos que hayan sido recaudados serán utilizados para cubrir las necesidades básicas requeridas para el funcionamiento del Escuela, empezando por los insumos requeridos para poder seguir impartiendo las clases en Grand Boukan.
Durante y después de la campaña ¿Qué pasará?
Desde ahora la comunidad de Gran Boukan y Noumenm estamos diseñando alternativas de mediano y largo plazo que permitan que la escuela por sí misma sea sostenible para la implementación del próximo año escolar.
Te invitamos a ser parte de esta historia que construimos al andar. Recuerda revisar a la derecha los ti kadò (pequeños obsequios) que hemos preparado para quienes nos ayuden.

Two years ago the Grand Boukan community organized itself to make a gift for its children: the Bassin Thomas Community School began operating. And from this day on, this small community project which started with less than 30 children has quadrupled its enrollment and has become one of the few opportunities to get elementary education in the area.
But with these new achievements new challenges emerged as well, like achieving long-term sustainability. The school faces a lack of funding and,the community all of us, Noumenm and yourselves, have to do something for the boys and girls in Grand Boukan. And as the Haitian people say, “pitì pitì”, little by little we will move forward to rise over the challenges.
Meet the idea.
“We want to help”… But, what it is to help someone? How do you really help someone? We can provide education, food, health and entertainment, but is that enough? The Igbo people have a saying: “Ora na-azu nwa”, it takes a village to raise a child. With this project, we make a commitment to believe in this ‘village’ and its community.
Noumenm is a Haitian Creole word that means “ourselves” and “yourselves” at the same time. The expression doesn’t make any difference in itself, but it is the context that provides with the particular meaning. So, when we talk about “you” in Haitian Creole, we might as well be talking about “us”.
Noumenm is also the name of our project, a gamble in which the “us” and “you” gets blurry, they mix and create something different. For over a year we’ve been working with the Grand Boukan community to strengthen development processes managed by local leaders. Some of the things we did during 2011:

The project participated in the 1st Melton Foundation Global Citizenship Celebration / Idea Incubator, in Jena, Germany. Noumenm was chosen by the participants and field experts over all other presented international projects, winning early funding for project implementation and support in the design and idea re-developing.
We secured the funding needed to purchase the land where the Bassin Thomas community school is located, this being the first real step to achieve sustainability.
In response to a cholera outbreak in the community, we established an Oral Rehydration Point, providing emergency supplies and, more importantly, training community volunteers who provided care not only to people of Grand Boukan, but also of nearby communities, reducing fatalities and helping to control the emergency.
Other than The Melton Foundation, Noumenm also has the support of America Solidaria Foundation in the implementation of some activities and which even co-managed the project of the Oral Rehydration Point.
What do we need?
We need to pay the teachers who day by day accompany the kids of the community, and have postponed their salary in order for the school to keep running. We also need to buy the basic school supplies for the year. You can find a detailed budget in the attached documents.
What for?
Securing the funding for this school year allows us to focus the community efforts in looking for sustainable solutions for the next one, utilizing grassroots initiatives and involving the government and other organizations.
Why?
Because the first step has been already made: the community has the physical space for the school and now we all can contribute for this place to continue be nourished with the joy and stories of its students; because we can make come true the dream of having an education for boys and girls of the Grand Boukan community; and because we are not short in hope nor in our capacity of achieving more.
What are we looking for?
We are searching for the support of people like you who, from the distance or closeness, want to bet in supporting the education, the people of Haiti and the Grand Boukan community.
How can you help us?


Nou fínanse nou: You can support us by donating to this fundraising. All the collected money will go straight to pay for the school operation.

Nou patajè istwa nou: You could share this initiative with your family, friends and contacts, so more people get to know about the Grand Boukan community and share our dream.

a little girl, I would swing on the hammock with my dad, and I'd ask
him, “Daddy, where do you want to go? We can go </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">anywhere</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.”
And we would. I would pluck the magic strings, and we would fly off
to enchanting places as far as our imaginations could reach. Now, I
have the opportunity to really pluck the strings. I have been invited
to participate in the global gap year program Thinking Beyond Borders
next year. Along with 18 other students and three program leaders, I
will journey to six different countries to study global development issues. My year will consist of living with host families,
fieldwork with local experts, academic study, language learning, and
independent travel opportunities. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As a junior in high school, <a href=""http://youmeweempower.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I launched my blog You Me We Empower</a> which focuses on human rights and the pursuit of happiness; it also </span>doubles as my non-profit organization of the same name's website. Over the past two years, I have dedicated my time to critical global issues, particularly women's rights and education equality; I've even coined myself an ""empowerment junkie."" My passion for global change is permanent, and I plan on majoring in International Relations and English in college so I can become an International Journalist.

</div></div>","An Empowering SummaryHello, everyone! My name is Mattie Wyndham, and I'm a senior in high school in coastal South Carolina. As
a little girl, I would swing on the hammock with my dad, and I'd ask
him, “Daddy, where do you want to go? We can go anywhere.”
And we would. I would pluck the magic strings, and we would fly off
to enchanting places as far as our imaginations could reach. Now, I
have the opportunity to really pluck the strings. I have been invited
to participate in the global gap year program Thinking Beyond Borders
next year. Along with 18 other students and three program leaders, I
will journey to six different countries to study global development issues. My year will consist of living with host families,
fieldwork with local experts, academic study, language learning, and
independent travel opportunities. As a junior in high school, I launched my blog You Me We Empower which focuses on human rights and the pursuit of happiness; it also doubles as my non-profit organization of the same name's website. Over the past two years, I have dedicated my time to critical global issues, particularly women's rights and education equality; I've even coined myself an ""empowerment junkie."" My passion for global change is permanent, and I plan on majoring in International Relations and English in college so I can become an International Journalist. This global gap year with TBB is exactly the kind of foundation I need to further my education and break outside the classroom walls. Thank you for your support! It means the world to me.Financial EmpowermentTotal Program Cost: $30,000I know it's a lot, and it is a tad overwhelming. BUT, Thinking Beyond Borders has generously agreed that for every $1 I raise, they'll raise $2!! This means that I just need to raise $10,000 by July 1st! (Airfare and travel expenses is around $5,000, so I need a rough total of $15,000). But with your help, I know it's possible! My fundraising plan is extensive. I intend to host multiple fundraisers, launch a letter writing campaign, apply for scholarships and grants, and reach out to those who have inspired me along the way. HOWEVER, if for some reason I cannot raise the money, while I will be dreadfully disappointed, the money will NOT go to waste! TBB will use it for furthering their scholarship program to help students like me realize their full potential and obtain a true purpose in life!Break It Down Now: The Empowering DetailsOrientation--Ecuador: 2 Weeks     We start the trip with a two week orientation in Ecuador where we get to know each other, learn about travel etiquette, complete health and safety training, and set goals for the adventurous year to come!



Unit 1--Ecuador: Natural Resources & the Environment--5 Weeks     The environment and its resources are threatened, and in this unit we will learn about  how production and consumption systems affect the environment, as well as industry, agriculture, and cultural conflicts. We will even plant trees to help local farmers.

Enrichment--Peru: Trek to Machu Pichu--1 Week     It's adventure time! During this ""enrichment week"" we will immerse ourselves even further into the culture in order to gain a new perspective. Plus, I will be breaking out of my comfort zone (a personal favorite of mine) by hiking the legendary Machu Pichu! During this four-day trek, we will learn about the Incan Empire and all its grand mysteries.

Unit 2--Thailand: Sustainable Agriculture--6 Weeks     In this second unit we will center our discussions around sustainable agriculture--an issue which often gets overlooked, in my opinion. The world's populations has tripled in the past 60 years, which has brought on great complications in the agriculture world. We will investigate how farmers, government, and businesses cooperate to balance demand for food with the ecosystem in Northern Thailand. By living in rural Thailand, we will immerse ourselves in the very culture we're learning about.
Enrichment--Cambodia: Angkor Wat--1 Week
     Hello, Cambodia! During this enrichment week we will travel to Angkor Wat to explore the legendary Khmer temples and tour powerful museums in Phnom Penh. 



Unit 3--India: Education & Economic Growth--5 Weeks      I am particularly excited for this unit because of my love for education equality. We will explore how education can empower individuals and communities to treat disease, produce goods, and support effective government. We'll even work in education centers for women and children in some of the poorest parts of Jaipur.

In fact, death tolls are in the millions in sub-Saharan Africa and some communities face the threat of collapse. During this five week experience we will work with home-based caregivers, a nursing center, and clinics.

Enrichment--South Africa: ADDO Safari--1 Week     Man, oh man. I don't think it's possible to express my excitement for this one! Elephants, lions, giraffes! I can't wait to cross this one off my bucket list. 

Culmination--Washington, DC: 3 Weeks     We will conclude our whirlwind experience back in the nation's capital. We’ll explore the relationship between the US and the rest of the world; we'll also meet representatives from the World Bank, Congress, and NGOs to discuss international development.

WE
HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL! Although it may
not look that way on the front page, we have reached our $10,000 goal for this
campaign thanks to a very generous donor. however, this gift will after the closing date of July 28. 
THANK YOU to all of our supporters and friends
for passing the word along about this campaign! You have shown us that our
community is strong and believes in what we’re doing. We’re changing lives
every day, and it’s all thanks to you.Let's Do This For The KidsSummertime’s supposed to be a great time for kids--a time for learning, discovery, and the joy of being a kid. At Boys & Girls Clubs of Brea - Placentia - Yorba Linda, we believe that every child should have the opportunity to learn and have fun in a safe, nurturing environment. Education, character development and healthy activity for every kid are at the heart of everything we do.With trips to the beach, park, baseball games, and other educational and entertaining activities, our summer day camp program gives working parents peace of mind and gives our campers a summer’s worth of great memories. Unfortunately, some of the kids who need our program the most are those whose families can’t afford it.Win-Win Situations RuleOur Club never turns away a kid who wants to be here--but we can only do that because our amazing community of supporters and partners make it possible. In 2013, 50% of our summer day campers needed some financial help to be able to attend.We are proud to have qualified and well-trained staff, trips that offer both fun and learning, and activities that help kids develop their character and leadership skills. But we need your help to bring these life-changing programs to more kids who need us. Will you step up and help us serve more kids in need?
We've got some great perks including once-in-a-lifetime experience, tickets to our events, Club swag, and much more.
Our goal is to raise $10,000 for summer camp scholarships. Every dollar donated will go towards helping our Club kids to enjoy a great summer experience!

<p><b>SGM Lifewords’</b> vision is to present the life-giving words of the Bible – to <b>see hearts changed and lives transformed</b>. We achieve this by freely resourcing people all over the world to share their faith through literature ministry and programmes. Our work started in 1888 and since then we have published well over a billion Bible resources in more than 1,000 languages worldwide.</p>
<p>However, demand is always greater than supply and the <b>need for quality Bible resources in some languages is especially evident</b>. One such language is Telugu, spoken by about 74 million people in southern and central India – it is the <b>3rd most used language in the country</b> and <b>13th in the world</b>.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1168756/files/20150123032435-tel-ai-cover-200.jpg?1422012275"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px;"" title=""A mock-up cover in Telugu""/> There are many churches and Christian ministries looking for resources to help them share the Gospel with Telugu speakers. Unfortunately, at the moment we have nothing to give them – <b>and here’s where you can help</b>! We are ready to publish a Telugu version of <i><a href=""http://books.google.pl/books?id=POkkAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">An Invitation</a></i> (a popular evangelistic booklet, <a href=""http://resources.sgmlifewords.com/global/en/search?controller=search&amp;orderby=position&amp;orderway=desc&amp;search_query=an+invitation&amp;submit_search="" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">available in many languages</a>). <b>To prepare and print 5,000 copies, we need 700 USD</b>.</p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the cost needed to publish the booklet in Telugu:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Translation and proof-reading</b>: 75 USD<br/>
This is the amount that we need to hire a competent translator and a professional proof-reader.</li>
<li>
<b>Typesetting and administrative work</b>: 75 USD<br/>
This is the cost of administering the project, preparing the typeset, having it checked and delivered to the printing press.</li>
<li>
<b>Printing</b>: 550 USD<br/>
This is the cost of printing 5,000 copies of <i>An Invitation</i> booklet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What if we do not get there</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>If we are unable to raise the whole amount, we will continue raising funds for this project in other places until funding is secured. Then the printing will commence. <b>Please rest assured that your contribution will not be wasted!</b></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""349"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/eBnUHPji7pQ"" width=""620""></iframe></div>
<p></p><p>It very often happens that people who are most actively involved in bringing the Gospel to others are <b>opportunity-rich but cash-poor</b>. They are usually on their own when it comes to obtaining literature for the people they reach. <b>SGM Lifewords</b> has always been at the forefront of resourcing believers. By providing a Christian population living in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and in the union territory of Yanam with an evangelistic booklet, we will help them share the Gospel with their fellow neighbours and other Telugu speakers.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>There are several risks involved in publishing a quality resource in a completely unfamiliar language, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>finding a competent translator and a professional proof-reader;</li>
<li>getting the typeset right (bad things tend to happen to fonts and texts laid out in non-Latin character sets);</li>
<li>quality of the final print output.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, we have considerable experience in publishing resources in various world languages. Risk no 1 is circumvented by <b>SGM Lifewords’</b> office in India which has numerous local contacts. This office has been able to provide us with translators and proof-readers in Hindi, Tamil and other languages.</p>
<p>As for risk no 2, we have already typeset many resources in challenging languages such as Arabic (which is a right-to-left language) or Chinese Simplified (with its own distinct set of characters). We have the necessary tools and experience to handle this with ease. Additionally, we have already published <i>An Invitation</i> in <a href=""http://resources.sgmlifewords.com/global/en/search?controller=search&amp;orderby=position&amp;orderway=desc&amp;search_query=%22an+invitation%22&amp;submit_search="" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">12 languages</a> so we know how to get it right.</p>
<p>Last but not least, quality control is something that we exercise on a regular basis. We always carefully check each print run and if necessary we request print shops to improve their work before accepting the final output. </p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>If you care about getting the Gospel out to people who have not heard it yet, you can use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about this campaign within your circle of influence. Thank you in advance for your help!</p></div>","Short Summary

However, demand is always greater than supply and the need for quality Bible resources in some languages is especially evident. One such language is Telugu, spoken by about 74 million people in southern and central India – it is the 3rd most used language in the country and 13th in the world.
 There are many churches and Christian ministries looking for resources to help them share the Gospel with Telugu speakers. Unfortunately, at the moment we have nothing to give them – and here’s where you can help! We are ready to publish a Telugu version of An Invitation (a popular evangelistic booklet, available in many languages). To prepare and print 5,000 copies, we need 700 USD.
What we need
Here’s a breakdown of the cost needed to publish the booklet in Telugu:


Translation and proof-reading: 75 USD
This is the amount that we need to hire a competent translator and a professional proof-reader.

Typesetting and administrative work: 75 USD
This is the cost of administering the project, preparing the typeset, having it checked and delivered to the printing press.

Printing: 550 USD
This is the cost of printing 5,000 copies of An Invitation booklet.


What if we do not get there

If we are unable to raise the whole amount, we will continue raising funds for this project in other places until funding is secured. Then the printing will commence. Please rest assured that your contribution will not be wasted!
The Impact

It very often happens that people who are most actively involved in bringing the Gospel to others are opportunity-rich but cash-poor. They are usually on their own when it comes to obtaining literature for the people they reach. SGM Lifewords has always been at the forefront of resourcing believers. By providing a Christian population living in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and in the union territory of Yanam with an evangelistic booklet, we will help them share the Gospel with their fellow neighbours and other Telugu speakers.
Risks & challenges
There are several risks involved in publishing a quality resource in a completely unfamiliar language, such as:

finding a competent translator and a professional proof-reader;
getting the typeset right (bad things tend to happen to fonts and texts laid out in non-Latin character sets);
quality of the final print output.

Fortunately, we have considerable experience in publishing resources in various world languages. Risk no 1 is circumvented by SGM Lifewords’ office in India which has numerous local contacts. This office has been able to provide us with translators and proof-readers in Hindi, Tamil and other languages.
As for risk no 2, we have already typeset many resources in challenging languages such as Arabic (which is a right-to-left language) or Chinese Simplified (with its own distinct set of characters). We have the necessary tools and experience to handle this with ease. Additionally, we have already published An Invitation in 12 languages so we know how to get it right.
Last but not least, quality control is something that we exercise on a regular basis. We always carefully check each print run and if necessary we request print shops to improve their work before accepting the final output. 
Other ways you can help
If you care about getting the Gospel out to people who have not heard it yet, you can use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about this campaign within your circle of influence. Thank you in advance for your help!",1.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<h2><strong>""Have Bear Will Run!""</strong></h2>
<p><em>Raising funds for the education of children fighting cancer. </em></p>
<h3><strong>WHO AM I?</strong></h3>
<p>My name is David King and I am an Education Coordinator at The Children’s Hospital, Westmead. My two great passions in life are children and sport and this year I am hoping to combine the two for what I believe to be a worthy and challenging cause. </p>
<p>In recent years I have attempted a variety of challenges to not only challenge myself but to also raise awareness for less fortunate children.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have trekked the Kokodo Trail,</li>
<li>I have run across the Sahara Desert in the 250km Marathon Des Sables Race,</li>
<li>I have set up an annual Indian Immersion exchange program and </li>
<li>I have attempted to solo swim the English Channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>I attempt these adventures to not only raise funds and awareness but to give people a sense of hope that anything is possible. I am committed now to helping families fight cancer by raising much needed funds for their children’s educational needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS 'HAVE BEAR WILL RUN?'</strong></h3>
<p>Over the next 5 months I will be attempting to complete a marathon in every state of Australia to raise money and awareness for the <em>‘Back on Track’ Program</em> at The Children’s Hospital, Westmead<strong>.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS THE 'BACK ON TRACK' PROGRAM?</strong></h3>
<p>When children are diagnosed with cancer their entire world is thrown into chaos. Education is one of the only areas in their life that they can still have a sense of control over.</p>
<p>The ‘Back On Track’ Program at The Children’s Hospital, Westmead works with children, families and schools to develop support plans that meet the educational and social needs of the students while they are having treatment. They also assist with their transition back to full time schooling when the time arises, as well as educating their school and friends on how to support a child fighting cancer. This completely unique program bridges the gap between families fighting cancer in hospital and their child’s school.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT I NEED? </strong></h3>
<p>In order to compete in this event and raise much needed funds for The Back on Track Program. I have undertaken a strenuous training schedule as well as a significant financial burden. And for this reason I am reaching out to the wider community to request sponsorship, support, help… anything that will ensure this journey is a success.</p>
<p>By using 'indiegogo' I am unashamedly putting my humility and pride aside. I need financial support to fund the extensive travel costs, which will ultimately help raise the funds, needed for the 'Back on Track' Program.

EARLA
works to improve government transparency and accountability, as well as protect
media and citizen access to information through the reform of substantive law
and administration of justice. EARLA works closely with its Egyptian
partners on the ground to develop structural reforms of relevant laws and
procedures that are accessible, fair, and efficient. 

EARLA’s work is nonpartisan and
does not serve the interests of a particular party, organization, or individual.
Rather, EARLA’s work focuses on supporting post-revolution reforms of Egypt’s
laws and procedures.

What We Have Done So Far
This past summer, during a training workshop, EARLA trained over forty attendees in Cairo on the elements of FOIL (Freedom of Information Legislation). Attendees learned about the key components of an affective freedom of information law, how it helps the average Egyptian, and ways in which the media, lawyers, and civil society can use the law to decrease corruption. 
Egyptians have asked us for more workshops about transparency to help them become a democratic society.  And we need your help!

ما
قمنا به حتى الان

في الصيف الماضي، خلال ورش عمل تدريبية، قامت اعضاء الجمعية المصرية الامريكية
لسيادة دور القانون  بتدريب اكثر من اربعين
في القاهرة على عناصر قانون حرية المعلومات، كيف تساعد المواطن المصري، و الطرق
التي يمكن لوسائل الاعلام، المحامين و المجتمع المدني ان تستخدم بها القانون
لتقليل الفساد
لقد طلبنا المصريون بالمزيد من ورش العمل حول الشفافية لمساعدتهم على ان يصبحوا
مجتمع ديموقراطي

a Significant Impact on Promoting Democracy
Egypt is a regional leader with
a vibrant civil society eager to transform authoritarian regimes
to functional democracies rooted in each country's norms and values.
 EARLA is committed to providing them with the expertise and objective
legal analysis to make informed decisions about the future of their nation.
EARLA is the only Egyptian
American organization that focuses exclusively on rule of law in Egypt - a
fundamental prerequisite for transitioning to democracy.  Through their
language skills, cultural familiarity, and personal contacts, EARLA members
have already made significant headway in supporting Egyptian lawyers, civil
society advocates, and journalists in their indigenous reform efforts.  But we can do more with your donations.  Please help us promote democractic reforms led by Egyptians!

<h3>Shannen Koostachin Profile<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Shannen Koostachin Cree from  Attawapiskat First Nation lead a movement for 
“safe and comfy” schools and quality culturally based education for 
First Nations children called the Attawapiskat School Campaign. She knew how hard it was to learn in an on reserve school 
that was under funded. The only elementary school for the 400 
children in Attawapiskat was closed as thousands of gallons of diesel 
fuel contaminated the ground under the school. The federal government 
put portable trailers on the play ground of the contaminated school as a
 “temporary school” until a new one could be built. <br/></p>
<p>Shannen never went to class in a proper school and the portables 
became more unbarable over time. The heat would often go off, the 
children would have to walk outside in the cold to go from one portable 
to another and the doors were warped. Therefore the children of Attawapiskat 
launched the Attawapiskat School Campaign to reach out to non-Aboriginal
 children all across Canada to write to the federal government and 
demand a new school for Attwapiskat. Thousands of children answered the call and three Ministers of Indian
 Affairs promised a new school and then broke their promise. The 
children kept writing. When the Minister of Indian Affairs, Chuck 
Strahl, wrote in 2008 to say the federal government could not fund a new
 school, the grade 8 class cancelled their graduation trip to Niagara 
Falls and used the money to send three youth, including Shannen, down to
 meet with Minister Strahl to demand a new school.
</p>
<p>Minister Strahl said the government could not afford a new school. 
Shannen did not believe him and that she told the Minister she would 
never give up because the younger children in her community deserve a 
proper school. She kept her promise. Shannen spoke to thousands of 
people asking for their help to ensure every child got a good education 
and a “comfy” school. She was an inspiring speaker because she talked 
from the heart. She made a compelling speech at an education rights 
conference hosted by the children of Attawapiskat and attended by 500 
other children at the University of Toronto in 2009.  Shannen’s incredible leadership was remarkable and she was nominated, as an 
ambassador for all the children of Attawapiskat, for the International 
Children’s Peace Prize given out by the Nobel Laureates. In 2009, 
Minister Strahl promised the children of Attawapiskat a new school.
</p>
<p>In May of 2010, Shannnen Koostachin passed away in an automobile 
accident. With the support of her loving family, friends and community, 
Shannen’s Dream is a campaign named in her memory to make sure all First
 Nations children across Canada have “safe and comfy schools” and 
receive a good quality education that makes them proud of who they are.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Whatchia!   My name is Jules Koostachin, I'm Cree from Attawapiskat First Nation and currently living in Sudbury with my family.  I currently work at Laurentian University as the Equity and Diversity Advisor in the Human Rights Office,  Northern Recruitment for the Indigenous Visual Culture Program at OCADU in Toronto, and as an educator at the University of Sudbury, Indigenous Studies program.  I am also a multimedia artist, and an activist for Indigenous rights and equal access to education. I will be heading out west this coming fall to start my PhD at UBC in the Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Social Justice Program where I will be focusing on Indigenous women and digital narratives.<br/>
</p>
<p>In 2011, I had
the opportunity to visit the sacred site where Shannen Koostachin passed away, just south of Temagami
in northern Ontario. To my surprise I found it extremely difficult to
locate because the shrine was up on a small hill on the side of highway 11.   To this day, the image of the community shrine for Shannen lives <span>in the back of my mind and has for many many years. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>In the summer of 2013,  I was
sitting at my desk in Toronto, and suddenly I was gifted with a  powerful vision; I quickly ran outside and
called my cousin Andrew Koostachin, the late Shannen’s father.  I asked for the family's permission to take the lead in
the creation of a monument/public installation for Shannen, and he agreed, giving me his full blessing.  I assured him that he and his family would be consulted throughout the development and installation process.<br/></span>
</p>
<p><span>For the last few years, my friend Rick Miller (fellow documentary filmmaker) and I have been trying to find ways to fund raise and gather community support in hopes that  Shannen's life's work is honoured and remembered.  </span><br/></p>
<p>To date I have been able to locate funding through the Ontario Arts Council, but I am still <b>IN NEED</b> of your community spirit and support to raise the remainder of the funds to go towards the balance owing for the completion of the bronze monument and lastly the installation of the monument.<br/></p>
<p>So I am asking all of you for your support to raise the last <b>$25,000 </b>which will go towards the monument base (granite, installation of the solar lights and transportation to site from Sudbury) and the remainder of the sculptor fees.    <br/></p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b>   I have been successful in securing a site for the monument/public installation; it will be installed this coming fall in New Liskeard, Ontario.  <br/></p>
<p>I feel that it is necessary to ensure that we have the Shannen Monument in northern Ontario, as this is where Shannen's roots are and it will be a sacred place where northern community members will be able to access and pay their respects. <br/></p>

After two years, we are in the final stages of the monument project!
Descriptor:  The piece will be a figurative depiction of Shannen Koostachin 
in her traditional regalia, incorporating impressionistic touches. The 
iconic figure will blend through drapery into a granite base. The 
sculpture will be finished in a traditional bronze patina, with 
highlights and color gradations on points of interest.
Here's a CBC story on the inspiration for the monument

Shannen Koostachin Profile


Shannen Koostachin Cree from  Attawapiskat First Nation lead a movement for 
“safe and comfy” schools and quality culturally based education for 
First Nations children called the Attawapiskat School Campaign. She knew how hard it was to learn in an on reserve school 
that was under funded. The only elementary school for the 400 
children in Attawapiskat was closed as thousands of gallons of diesel 
fuel contaminated the ground under the school. The federal government 
put portable trailers on the play ground of the contaminated school as a
 “temporary school” until a new one could be built. 
Shannen never went to class in a proper school and the portables 
became more unbarable over time. The heat would often go off, the 
children would have to walk outside in the cold to go from one portable 
to another and the doors were warped. Therefore the children of Attawapiskat 
launched the Attawapiskat School Campaign to reach out to non-Aboriginal
 children all across Canada to write to the federal government and 
demand a new school for Attwapiskat. Thousands of children answered the call and three Ministers of Indian
 Affairs promised a new school and then broke their promise. The 
children kept writing. When the Minister of Indian Affairs, Chuck 
Strahl, wrote in 2008 to say the federal government could not fund a new
 school, the grade 8 class cancelled their graduation trip to Niagara 
Falls and used the money to send three youth, including Shannen, down to
 meet with Minister Strahl to demand a new school.

Minister Strahl said the government could not afford a new school. 
Shannen did not believe him and that she told the Minister she would 
never give up because the younger children in her community deserve a 
proper school. She kept her promise. Shannen spoke to thousands of 
people asking for their help to ensure every child got a good education 
and a “comfy” school. She was an inspiring speaker because she talked 
from the heart. She made a compelling speech at an education rights 
conference hosted by the children of Attawapiskat and attended by 500 
other children at the University of Toronto in 2009.  Shannen’s incredible leadership was remarkable and she was nominated, as an 
ambassador for all the children of Attawapiskat, for the International 
Children’s Peace Prize given out by the Nobel Laureates. In 2009, 
Minister Strahl promised the children of Attawapiskat a new school.

In May of 2010, Shannnen Koostachin passed away in an automobile 
accident. With the support of her loving family, friends and community, 
Shannen’s Dream is a campaign named in her memory to make sure all First
 Nations children across Canada have “safe and comfy schools” and 
receive a good quality education that makes them proud of who they are.
Quoting Jenny Nakogee (the late Shannen's mother): ""My message is to never give up. You get up, pick up your books and keep walking in your moccasins.""

Summary
Whatchia!   My name is Jules Koostachin, I'm Cree from Attawapiskat First Nation and currently living in Sudbury with my family.  I currently work at Laurentian University as the Equity and Diversity Advisor in the Human Rights Office,  Northern Recruitment for the Indigenous Visual Culture Program at OCADU in Toronto, and as an educator at the University of Sudbury, Indigenous Studies program.  I am also a multimedia artist, and an activist for Indigenous rights and equal access to education. I will be heading out west this coming fall to start my PhD at UBC in the Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Social Justice Program where I will be focusing on Indigenous women and digital narratives.

In 2011, I had
the opportunity to visit the sacred site where Shannen Koostachin passed away, just south of Temagami
in northern Ontario. To my surprise I found it extremely difficult to
locate because the shrine was up on a small hill on the side of highway 11.   To this day, the image of the community shrine for Shannen lives in the back of my mind and has for many many years. 
In the summer of 2013,  I was
sitting at my desk in Toronto, and suddenly I was gifted with a  powerful vision; I quickly ran outside and
called my cousin Andrew Koostachin, the late Shannen’s father.  I asked for the family's permission to take the lead in
the creation of a monument/public installation for Shannen, and he agreed, giving me his full blessing.  I assured him that he and his family would be consulted throughout the development and installation process.

For the last few years, my friend Rick Miller (fellow documentary filmmaker) and I have been trying to find ways to fund raise and gather community support in hopes that  Shannen's life's work is honoured and remembered.  
To date I have been able to locate funding through the Ontario Arts Council, but I am still IN NEED of your community spirit and support to raise the remainder of the funds to go towards the balance owing for the completion of the bronze monument and lastly the installation of the monument.
So I am asking all of you for your support to raise the last $25,000 which will go towards the monument base (granite, installation of the solar lights and transportation to site from Sudbury) and the remainder of the sculptor fees.    
NOTE:   I have been successful in securing a site for the monument/public installation; it will be installed this coming fall in New Liskeard, Ontario.  
I feel that it is necessary to ensure that we have the Shannen Monument in northern Ontario, as this is where Shannen's roots are and it will be a sacred place where northern community members will be able to access and pay their respects. 
JULES' BIO:  Born in Moose Factory, Ontario, Jules Arita Koostachin was raised by her Cree speaking grandparents in Moosonee, and her mother in Ottawa. She is from Attawapiskat First Nation, and currently resides in Sudbury. While living in Toronto, she completed graduate school at Ryerson University where she was awarded the Award of Distinction for her thesis work, as well as the Masters level Ryerson Gold Medal for academic achievement. While pursuing her Masters, Jules finished her first feature length documentary Remembering Inninimowin, about her journey of remembering the Cree language, now distributed by V Tape. After graduation, Jules was one of six women selected across Canada for the Women in the Directors Chair program at the Banff Centre, where she directed a scene from her script Broken Angel. She just finished production of her television youth series AskiBOYZ for APTN, about two urban Cree youth going back to the basics. Jules’ company VisJuelles Productions Inc. has a number of television and film projects in development, her most recent development is Red Barz about the incarceration of Indigenous women in Canada with Shaw Media. She has been working in the Indigenous community for many years servicing Indigenous women and children who are facing barriers. She hopes to continue creating pieces of work in theatre, literary arts, television, and film that will bring to light social issues that urban and rural Indigenous peoples face.http://www.visjuellesproductions.ca/

How can I get me students to listen to me, if my instrument won't? My goals are to teach a creative/experimental ensemble for instrumentalist and composers, applied saxophone lessons, and work as the cultural diversity specialist for a high school or college that values cultural diversity, creativity, and community.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Hello:  My name is Irene and my husband and I are here to ask for donations to purchase a second hand wheelchair van.  I am a Polio survivor and have spent over 55 years in a wheelchair.  Now I am experiencing the effects of Post Polio Syndrome. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Our current van has <em>over 250,000 miles on it now</em>.  It is falling apart and this is our only means of transportation.  A new van would be out of our reach as they cost $45,000 and up.  We think we could find a used van that still has life in it and would fit our needs.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>You probably know someone that was touched by the Polio epidemic.  Maybe a parent or grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister, or even you yourself.  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Hundreds of thousands of these survivors are experiencing a second round of symptoms.  This comes from the overuse of their good muscles to compensate for what was lost. After establishing a life, being hit a second time with the Post Polio symptoms is very hard.  Most doctors that know about how to treat Polio patients are also dying which leaves us in quite a situation.  Most younger doctors have no idea how we were effected.</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>My husband is also disabled and works part time.  His job with our disability benefits makes for limited income.  We have one credit card that we hope to pay off if we get enough funds.  Then my husband could quit his job and stay home and take care of me.  My condition has steadily grown worse and I don't have the strength to be at home by myself.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>I set our goal as $10,000 because any amount would be a blessing.  But we are hoping to get $20000.  This would give us about $15000 for a used van and $5000 to pay off our Sears Card.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Then by being really frugal, Joe could quit his job and be home with me.</strong></h3>
<h2><strong> A Few Of Our Problems</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>I have severe scoliosis and have had 3 surgeries but that was years ago and the scoliosis continues to worsen.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>I have great fatigue and sleep problems.  My weakness prevents me from doing many of the things I used to do.  My poor husband has to do most of the housework and cooking.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>My hands have been going numb, which makes even using the computer very difficult. (and I love to use my computer and photoshop).</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>My aches and pains get so bad that many times I have to stay in bed and just rest to recoup.  (I don't even like going shopping anymore!)</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>My husband, Joe has back problems from his accident.  His leg is constantly numb.  His varicose veins are very bad.  He also suffers from Fibromyagia which causes him constant aches and pains.</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>What we hope to do with old van</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>If we are able to get a new van we would like to donate our old van to our local, small town senior center.  Then seniors with disabilities could get a ride to the center for food, fun and association.</strong></h3>

Both Dr. Wright and  Jose informed  me that it would be necessary to meet with the Mayor and  write a letter to the people of the town.  Thanks to  the assistance of Eileen,  Dede, and Jean Claude and other staff members at Center val bio a meeting with the Mayor was arranged. The Mayor was very open and grateful for our plans to provide something positive for the village.   At the close of our meeting he shook my hand and said ""I am looking forward  to your mission to bring Nature education to the Village. This will be of great benefit to our children.""  A few months later we received a letter from the people of Ranomafana giving us permission to have the nature center in the their town!Since December 2011 we have shared over 20 lessons through Skype sessions, Nature videos, activity sheets , and provided snack for the children.  This program has continued and has been funded through Erik's Reptile Edventures and  with donations from friends, and costs about 300 dollars a month to run the program. We also set up a not for Profit called WKCI to allow us to Raise funds and WKCI was set up in May 2012 with the approval of the Education Department of NY. After providing educational programs for hundreds of schools and institutions throughout the New York Tri-state area it was time to expand the give back to the local and global community by connecting our kids to nature and life beyond our own back yard.We Want You To Join!  The most important thing is for you all to be part of an effort that will change your life!  It has definitely changed mine and  the lives of others. The feeling of joy that is shared when your heart is open to the whole of humanity is indescribable!  On January 31st we received an estimate pictured below and it will cost 65,000 to build the Nature education center, We will need the support of many to generate the funds. We really want you to be part of this and to share in the global community! On January  31st the contractor sent an estimate  including the cost  of 65,000 to build the center.  The additional 35,000 will run the center for the next 3 years and Provide education for thousands of Kids we're hoping for millions over the next 10 years. Who Benefits?Our kids and everyone who will listen! The funds we seek will help the children have a nature center that will provide weekly activities, and a chance to go to school we will also get the unite with the local communities to support conservation and preservation initiatives in Madagascar and any of the countries we visit.Please give what you can afford. All donations will be greatly appreciated.*When Will The Journey Begin?The Journey will begin from February 22nd until March 10th  Live from Erik's Reptile Edventures Website www. edventureshow .com and click on the video tab  then click streaming Live..

expenses through the completion of our Fall 2013 season.  This will include purchasing more uniforms
(currently our entrants in early morning races have to give their uniforms to
teammates to re-wear in later races). 
We’d like to buy a second sun canopy so we don’t all have to stand

<h3>How You Can Help:</h3>
<p></p>Even small donations make an enormous difference!  We are truly grateful for any donation!  As extra thanks, every donator of over $50
will receive a signed photo of our team. 
In addition, that donator will be “adopted” by a member of our team and
will receive updates on personal and team progress and results.<br/><br/><p>Any funds received above our necessary amount will be used
to begin the funding of next year’s team.

<p>Cross country running is a sport that can dramatically affect the
lives of its participants, as alumni of the sport will attest.  It strengthens will and determination, and
teaches goal-setting.  Thank you to

Youth unemployment is a massive problem for the people of Tanzania - a country with a very low life expectancy of 65 years. We at DAREnterprisers are striving to change things by generating active social enterprises, which solve problems for low income communities through an 8 week course. We also aim to help participants develop transferable skills, build confidence and provide them with a worthwhile experience that sets them up for future career opportunities. We achieve these goals through classroom sessions taught by students from the University of Cambridge and the University of Dar es Salaam, as well as peer-to-peer learning, mentorship and collaboration with local entrepreneurs.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why are we holding a conference?</strong></p><p>The Tengeneza Tanzania Together Conference is our participants’ chance to shine: the culmination of eight weeks of work with their business ideas on display. The conference will be attended by incubators, investors and NGOs capable of giving the businesses the mentorship and financial kickstart they need to succeed. Their businesses will be judged by a panel of expert business leaders with feedback to help their businesses have the best start possible.

This is where you can help us out. What is the Cambridge Development Initiative's DAREnterprisers course?In a survey done by the non-governmental organization Restless Development, out of over 1,000 young people across Tanzania, only 14 percent reported working a formal, wage-earning job. Youth unemployment is a massive problem for the people of Tanzania - a country with a very low life expectancy of 65 years. We at DAREnterprisers are striving to change things by generating active social enterprises, which solve problems for low income communities through an 8 week course. We also aim to help participants develop transferable skills, build confidence and provide them with a worthwhile experience that sets them up for future career opportunities. We achieve these goals through classroom sessions taught by students from the University of Cambridge and the University of Dar es Salaam, as well as peer-to-peer learning, mentorship and collaboration with local entrepreneurs. Why are we holding a conference?The Tengeneza Tanzania Together Conference is our participants’ chance to shine: the culmination of eight weeks of work with their business ideas on display. The conference will be attended by incubators, investors and NGOs capable of giving the businesses the mentorship and financial kickstart they need to succeed. Their businesses will be judged by a panel of expert business leaders with feedback to help their businesses have the best start possible. Help us kickstart businesses with the potential to change lives. Great ideas need great people to make them happen. The Tengeneza Tanzania Together Conference is how these great people will connect. Where will your money go?All donations will go towards the costs of the conference, helping to change the lives of our participants, like George and Grace, and change Tanzania as a whole.  A bit about the Cambridge Development Initiative...The Cambridge Development Initiative (CDI) is a charity with the aim of empowering local change-makers to make a sustainable difference. They believe that students can be the catalyst. The DAREnterprisers course and conference is only one of the projects under the umbrella of CDI.

I'd like to thank you for taking time to consider investing in the manifestation of my collective passions, my brainchild, and one of the centerpieces of my life's work - Keyz 2 tha Lexis (K2thaL). Now, I know upon reading that business title it may bring to mind luxury automobiles, but you’d only be half right. Instead, K2thaL is a vehicle to transport learners into the fullest knowledge about how language works, where ‘Lexis’ is Greek meaning word or speech, so Keyz 2 tha Lexis means keys to the word.</p><p>K2thaL is an innovative and comprehensive linguistics language arts learning system that uses performing arts, particularly, music, dance, lyricism, and theater as strategies to teach Pre-K through 8th grade students all about the field of Linguistics, which is the science of language. In the K2thaL system, students and instructors sing, dance, rap, and act their way to language proficiency and linguistic mastery. In addition, within K2thaL system, each Linguistic field of study, from phonology to pragmatics, has an array of character instructors, from Master Ninja Lexin to Professor Peabodie Lexla, who are uniquely trained to teach within each field. For over a decade, I have been providing educational facilities, after school programs, and private residences with group learning sessions and private tutoring using the K2thaL method. As an Atlanta native, I have served over 600 students across metro-Atlanta. Many of my K2thaL students have gone on to earn a number of academic accolades such as principal's list, honor roll, nominations and inductions into gifted programs, and literacy awards at proficiency levels that surpass the curricular standards.</p><p>I came up with the idea of K2thaL in 2006, began building on that ideation over several years, and then became a Pre-K educator in 2009, affording me the opportunity to implement K2thaL directly in the classroom. In 2012 with the K2thaL system as my motivation, I went on to continue my education a Georgia State University (GSU) by earning a B.A. in Applied Linguistics with minors in English (concentrating my coursework on creative writing) and African American Studies, followed by an M.A. in Applied Linguistics in 2016. I have been a research assistant during undergrad in the Department of English, a graduate research assistant in the College of Education, and am currently a graduate assistant professor in the department of Entrepreneurship and Innovation. In tandem, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the College of Education majoring in Teaching and Learning with a concentration in Language and Literacy. I'm blessed to be on track to be the first person on both sides my family to earn a Ph.D., and with only 1% of the general population earning doctoral degrees, and even more shocking, only 2.5% of all doctoral degrees being earned by black men (according to the national center for education statistics), I feel a great deal of obligation to not only my family, but also to my community, and the world at large. I think it extremely important and necessary for students of color, and in actuality, children of all races, to see black males in a positive light as sources of great wisdom and wielding a wealth of knowledge. Personally, I want to be the dopest, most effective and most fun teacher students will ever encounter, elevating them to the highest heights of their language ability and beyond. Amazingly, Keyz 2 tha Lexis is the platform that affords such an opportunity—to unlock the full potential in every student.</p><p><strong>The Campaign: K2thaL Digitized</strong></p><p>The specific purpose of this campaign is to raise capital to begin conversion of the K2thaL live sessions that I have been developing over the last decade and produce a series of digital content on a membership-based, e-learning platform. The general aim of digitizing these K2thaL sessions is to create digital content that is effective, awe-inspiring, and fun, through what I call a cinematic learning experience, or an edutainment experience, complete with various degrees of performing arts, animation, visual effects, storylines, segues, interludes, content breakdowns, lesson reviews, interactive activities, gamification, companion lesson guides, and much more.</p><p>The funds will be used for two purposes:</p><p>1<sup>st</sup> to build membership-based, e-learning website with integrated apps (android and iOS)</p><ul>
<li>Tiered memberships offering various levels of access</li>
<li>Direct purchase of lessons with off-line access restricted to the apps</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>2<sup>nd</sup> to produce three 7-10 minute mini-session videos from the K2thaL system, each accompanied with interactive game activities, which will serve as preliminary content for the website, the springboard for marketing, and the foundation to bootstrap the system or a presentation demo to elicit additional funding. Each mini-session will have a different character instructor from the K2thaL staff teaching the lesson.</p><p>The three K2thaL mini-sessions will be as follows.</p><ul>
<li>Intro to Linguistics with Captain Lexis (What is Language?)</li>
<li>Intro to Scribing with Master Ninja Lexin (Capital A,B and lower case a,b)</li>
<li>Intro to Phonics with LexLuthIcon (Short a and long a sounds, i.e. /ă/ and /ā/)</li>
</ul><p>The three K2thaL mini-session activities will be as follows.</p><ul>
<li>Passing messages (Student avatar passes messages through various interactions)</li>
<li>Scribing letters ninja style (Students have POV experience writing letters like a ninja)</li>
<li>A for apple (Student uses rhythm, phonetic notation, and phonics to create an apple tree to a nice beat)</li>
</ul><p>Long term, the website and integrated apps will eventually offer over 90 hours of video lesson content covering the entire spectrum of linguistics studies (graphology, phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, and pragmatics) with gamification in the form of interactive activities and quizzes as well as other resources and content.</p><p>I am projecting that the three mini-sessions will be produced 1<sup>st</sup> quarter of 2021. During 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter 2021, the website will soft launch, production will continue, and the demo will be marketed to increase traffic to the website, acquire key endorsers/influencers, and possibly engage investors for a funding round. By 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter 2021, the website will fully launch and I am hoping to generate enough revenue to sustain or scale production and/or acquire large enough capital investment to maintain or scale production.  </p><p><strong>The Ask: K2thaL Funds Breakdown                                         </strong></p><p>This K2thaL funding campaign is seeking 65K.

<li>Solves the issue of e-learning with the current COVID-19 crisis</li>
<li>Focuses solely on one of the two most important subjects to later academic and social success- language arts</li>
<li>Earliest and most comprehensive language arts-focused program starting at Preschool/PreK and continuing through 8<sup>th</sup> grade</li>

<li>Possibility for earlier entry conventional literacy (possibly reading and writing at earlier age)</li>
<li>Possibly improve overall analytical skills</li>
<li>Possibility to carry over skills to improve success in other subjects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aids teachers and parents in tracking student progress in language arts and literacy development</li>
<li>Provides full language arts curriculum and/or supplemental lesson plans for private and public educators and institutions, as well as for home schooling</li>
<li>Provides parents with engaging education content that will keep their students’ attention for extended periods and is safe from inappropriate online content</li>
<li>Provides convenient learning no matter where students are, whether at home, in a vehicle, or at school because of the web-based platform and integrated mobile apps (android and iOS)</li>
<li>Created by an expert with multiple degrees in linguistics and education (a B.A. two minors, an M.A., and is PhD candidate), over a decade of experience in the field of education, and a great wealth of creativity and passion for teaching, learning, language, and performing arts</li>
</ul><p>The mantra for K2thaL is “to achieve the monumentally propitious success of Keyz 2 tha Lexis.” It is the business goal of K2thaL to be the most successful learning program ever to hit the market across several metrics: most improved learners in every age bracket, most proficient learners in every age bracket, greatest household name recognition, most active users/subscribers on any e-learning platform, most paying subscribers on any e-learning platform, most revenues and profits out of any learning program/system</p><p><strong>The Challenges: The obstacles that K2thaL will overcome </strong></p><p>The major hurtles that K2thaL will face are logistical and financial. The production schedule for the system is a bit aggressive and lengthy. The goal is to produce 3 mini-sessions (30 mins of video content) per week, plus the accompanied interactive activities, games, and other content for a 42-week production year, which produces 21 hours of video content in a calendar year. That is similar to producing a weekly television series with the added responsibility of creating gamification content.</p><p>To combat this challenge, I have created a strongly advised weekly/monthly production schedule.</p><ul>
<li>½ day to full day production meeting at the first of the production week<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>Use PowerPoints from live-sessions as storyboards for digital lessons as well as other storyboarding software</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Audio and video production for 3 mini-sessions produced over 3 days each week (Benjamin)</li>
<li>3-7 days to add VFX to video content each week (Maybe on a weekly schedule that produces output from the previous week’s video production; for example, if content A is produced week 1, then the final VFX output will be rendered week 2)</li>
<li>5-30 days to produce gamification activities and quizzes (Maybe on bi-weekly or monthly schedule that produces output from the previous weeks’ video production; for example, if content A, B, and C are produced weeks 1-3, the final gamification output will be rendered weeks 3-5 or all at once in the month that follows)</li>
</ul><p>The logistics of production from collaboration to cinematography, visual effects to gamification, and editing to uploading will be a challenge. The K2thaL production team will really need to run like a well-oiled machine to crank out the content every week. The full system will encompass approximately 90 video content also with the accompanied interactive activities, games, and other content, which if the 42-week production year is adhered, will take approximately 4 1/3 years to complete the full system.</p><p>This is why I am starting funding 6 months before we begin production, so that I can assemble the best team and get us all on the same page in terms of expectations and workflow. In addition, we are doing a soft launch (2<sup>nd</sup> quarter 2021) 3 months before the full launch (3<sup>rd</sup> quarter) in an attempt to work out any bugs in the system. I will also seek to attain a strategic partnership with Tyler Perry and Tyler Perry studios, which will serve as the venue and provide the resources necessary for scaling production.</p><div>
<p>I am aware that this will have to be a goal to be attained at a pace that does not overextend the production crew, under deliver on quality, nor over promise regarding output timelines. If the weekly output goal becomes too great, I am more than willing to scale out the output timeline to make sure that the production quality is A1, top notch. At minimum, the monthly production will be 30 mins of video content with accompanied game activities.</p>
<p>The next challenge is financial. The bulk of the operation costs will be paying the creatives to help produce the system. When approximating a staff of 11 and considering the cost of the e-learning platform, marketing, music licensing, and other operational costs, minimum budget is 800K a year, which equates to 5.13K per 7-10-min mini-session or 15.38K per 30-min full session. Depending on if and how production may be scaled, particularly with regards to bringing on more creatives and professionals, that cost could max out at approximately 2.6 million dollars per year, which equates to 16.67K per 7-10-min mini session or 50K per 30 full session. My hope is that the system can be bootstrapped and enough revenue can be generated to both sustain and scale production.</p>
</div><p>To combat this challenge, I will rollout an introductory pre-subscription rate of $1.99 per month for the first 6 months of the full launch period ($11.96 total), which will start 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> quarter 2021. I will begin presubscriptions as early as 4<sup>th</sup> quarter 2020 and as late as during soft launch 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter 2021. The goal would be to acquire 70K subscribers during that 3-9 month period, which would cover minimum budget productions costs for one year ($800K) and the goal is to have that revenue before full launch 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter 2021. After which, we would be constantly producing more content, acquiring more subscribers, generating more revenues, and thus bootstrapping the system. In the event that we need additional funding, the subscription revenues would serve as our foundation for valuation. I will also seek funding from various grants such as the Small Business Innovation Research grant with the Institute of Education Sciences. In addition, I will also focus on acquiring several key endorsers/influencers in the entertainment industry, particularly, Tyler Perry, Daymond John, T.I. “Tip” Harris, Killer Mike, Ryan Cameron, 2chainz and his wife Kesha Epps, to generate lots publicity and exponentially increase subscriptions.</p><p><strong>Alternative ways of supporting the Keyz: How to help outside of crowdfunding </strong></p><p>Please share this crowdfunding campaign on all social media platforms and tell all of your friends, teachers, school administrators, principles, daycare owners, and parents about K2thaL!

The mantra for K2thaL is “to achieve the monumentally propitious success of Keyz 2 tha Lexis.” It is the business goal of K2thaL to be the most successful learning program ever to hit the market across several metrics: most improved learners in every age bracket, most proficient learners in every age bracket, greatest household name recognition, most active users/subscribers on any e-learning platform, most paying subscribers on any e-learning platform, most revenues and profits out of any learning program/systemThe Challenges: The obstacles that K2thaL will overcome The major hurtles that K2thaL will face are logistical and financial. The production schedule for the system is a bit aggressive and lengthy. The goal is to produce 3 mini-sessions (30 mins of video content) per week, plus the accompanied interactive activities, games, and other content for a 42-week production year, which produces 21 hours of video content in a calendar year. That is similar to producing a weekly television series with the added responsibility of creating gamification content.To combat this challenge, I have created a strongly advised weekly/monthly production schedule.
½ day to full day production meeting at the first of the production weekUse PowerPoints from live-sessions as storyboards for digital lessons as well as other storyboarding software

Audio and video production for 3 mini-sessions produced over 3 days each week (Benjamin)
3-7 days to add VFX to video content each week (Maybe on a weekly schedule that produces output from the previous week’s video production; for example, if content A is produced week 1, then the final VFX output will be rendered week 2)
5-30 days to produce gamification activities and quizzes (Maybe on bi-weekly or monthly schedule that produces output from the previous weeks’ video production; for example, if content A, B, and C are produced weeks 1-3, the final gamification output will be rendered weeks 3-5 or all at once in the month that follows)
The logistics of production from collaboration to cinematography, visual effects to gamification, and editing to uploading will be a challenge. The K2thaL production team will really need to run like a well-oiled machine to crank out the content every week. The full system will encompass approximately 90 video content also with the accompanied interactive activities, games, and other content, which if the 42-week production year is adhered, will take approximately 4 1/3 years to complete the full system.This is why I am starting funding 6 months before we begin production, so that I can assemble the best team and get us all on the same page in terms of expectations and workflow. In addition, we are doing a soft launch (2nd quarter 2021) 3 months before the full launch (3rd quarter) in an attempt to work out any bugs in the system. I will also seek to attain a strategic partnership with Tyler Perry and Tyler Perry studios, which will serve as the venue and provide the resources necessary for scaling production.
I am aware that this will have to be a goal to be attained at a pace that does not overextend the production crew, under deliver on quality, nor over promise regarding output timelines. If the weekly output goal becomes too great, I am more than willing to scale out the output timeline to make sure that the production quality is A1, top notch. At minimum, the monthly production will be 30 mins of video content with accompanied game activities.
The next challenge is financial. The bulk of the operation costs will be paying the creatives to help produce the system. When approximating a staff of 11 and considering the cost of the e-learning platform, marketing, music licensing, and other operational costs, minimum budget is 800K a year, which equates to 5.13K per 7-10-min mini-session or 15.38K per 30-min full session. Depending on if and how production may be scaled, particularly with regards to bringing on more creatives and professionals, that cost could max out at approximately 2.6 million dollars per year, which equates to 16.67K per 7-10-min mini session or 50K per 30 full session. My hope is that the system can be bootstrapped and enough revenue can be generated to both sustain and scale production.
To combat this challenge, I will rollout an introductory pre-subscription rate of $1.99 per month for the first 6 months of the full launch period ($11.96 total), which will start 3rd and 4th quarter 2021. I will begin presubscriptions as early as 4th quarter 2020 and as late as during soft launch 2nd quarter 2021. The goal would be to acquire 70K subscribers during that 3-9 month period, which would cover minimum budget productions costs for one year ($800K) and the goal is to have that revenue before full launch 3rd quarter 2021. After which, we would be constantly producing more content, acquiring more subscribers, generating more revenues, and thus bootstrapping the system. In the event that we need additional funding, the subscription revenues would serve as our foundation for valuation. I will also seek funding from various grants such as the Small Business Innovation Research grant with the Institute of Education Sciences. In addition, I will also focus on acquiring several key endorsers/influencers in the entertainment industry, particularly, Tyler Perry, Daymond John, T.I. “Tip” Harris, Killer Mike, Ryan Cameron, 2chainz and his wife Kesha Epps, to generate lots publicity and exponentially increase subscriptions.Alternative ways of supporting the Keyz: How to help outside of crowdfunding Please share this crowdfunding campaign on all social media platforms and tell all of your friends, teachers, school administrators, principles, daycare owners, and parents about K2thaL!

<p>Diagnosed with breast cancer at 47 in 2007, I found painting with my breast a wonderful mode of art therapy which helped me heal from some deeper issues associated with the ravages of breast cancer which I could otherwise perhaps not express in words.

You see, I found a way to flourish despite the tempest. Initially, it was a way to express myself without words.

<p> </p>
<p>My audience is women diagnosed with breast cancer and their caregivers. I understand them because I AM them. By turning my art into cancer support cards and calendars coupled with uplifting messages and mailing them out to women stricken with breast cancer, I empower them from the stance of someone in the same bra as they are (i.e., someone who is in the struggle and at times, I sell some everyday items (e.g., watches, purses, envelope openers, keychains, umbrellas) to which I have applied my artwork in order to offset the cost of printing and mailing  the free postcards and calendars with uplifting messages to breast cancer patients. </p>

<p>What is art, if not the expression of creative skill and imagination which produces works to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power?

</h5>
<p><em>In 2001,  Lama Tenzin, a young Tibetan monk, began his journey to rescue children from poor living conditions in the isolated villages in the Himalayan border region of Upper Dolpo, Nepal. He built a home for them in India where he, his mother and his sisters raised and educated them, and provided them with spiritual guidance with the hope that these children would return to their homes one day and do the same for their communities. The journey to rescue these children is very dangerous. The Dolpo is the highest inhabited region on the planet, with villages around 15,000-17,000 feet in elevation.There is little in Dolpo in the way of food, employment, medicine or schooling. The central government is far away in Kathmandu, and little assistance has been given to the residents of Dolpo in the form of bridges, roads, clinics, or basic infrastructure. In fact, there are no roads anywhere in Dolpo. All transportation is on foot or by horseback. Yaks are often used as beasts of burden.<br/></em></p>
<p><em>Children in Dolpo start work as early as the age of four, gathering twigs and yak dung for fuel, or minding the yaks. Living with their animals, the children often contract diseases such as skin anthrax. Food is comprised of barley meal, yak milk, yak cheese and Tibetan tea.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the past 10 years, CED HOUSE  has grown to 21 orphans and underprivileged children. The children are mostly girls, some of whom have disabilities. The first group of these children will be graduating from high school this year-marking <strong>the first time children from these remote border villages have ever received a formal education. </strong>The culture in these remote regions still favors sons over daughters. The traditions still support old ideas that keep alive the inequalities between men and women by maintaining that only boys can provide financial support for the family. And girls born with disabilites are quite literally discarded by their families and the larger village community, believed to be ""bad omens"". Lama Tenzin first saw Pema-the young girl  whose rescue is depicted in the attached video - who was born unable to walk - living outside with the cows and other animals, given a bowl of food and nothing else each day. She was quite literally left outside with the animals until Lama Tenzin obtained permission from her family and the Nepali Government to take her in and give her a chance at a full life.<br/></em></p>

<p>I have known Lama Tenzin for many years. I call him The Feminist Lama- because he believes and dedicates his life to ensuring that women's voices and ideas are as valuable as those of men. He knows that education increases girls’ options to live a full and meaningful life empowering them to take leadership roles in family, school, and community. Your support will allow Lama Tenzin to continue this vital work of the rescue, nurture and education of these girls that have no other advocate. They are truly forgotten. You have the rare opportunity with your donations to deliver a meaningful life to a child who may become the next great doctor, inventor, lawyer, scientist, writer or teacher. If we support them - they will take their knowledge into the world and some will even return to their villages and enrich their communities in ways we cannot imagine. They also recieve practical vocational skill training so that they may seek meaningful employment and acheive economic independence.</p>
<p>Together, with Lama Tenzin Choegyal you can remove the educational, societal, and professional barriers for girls with disabilities.</p>
<p> Please give what you can. Our $40,000 goal will go toward the immediate rescue trek to Upper Dolpo that is planned for this June! Without these vital funds, Lama Tenzin cannot rescue another child like Pema, who is now thriving in her new home at Lama's orphanage in Dehardun, India. She is going to school, receiving medical care and the nutrition she needs to grow into a healthy and independent young woman.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Columbine Elementary PTA has been raising money for 4+ years for a Growing Dome Greenhouse to compliment our Garden to Table Program and serve as a year round growing and learning center for classes.  We are now only ~$4,000 shy of our goal and hope you can help!  (Since we started this Indiegogo campaign, we have received a donation of $1,500 in addition to the contributions shown above!)</p>

Columbine Elementary PTA has been raising money for 4+ years for a Growing Dome Greenhouse to compliment our Garden to Table Program and serve as a year round growing and learning center for classes.  We are now only ~$4,000 shy of our goal and hope you can help!  (Since we started this Indiegogo campaign, we have received a donation of $1,500 in addition to the contributions shown above!)

<p>Hey there team! Azziza here. I'm a single mom with 2 amazing daughters; ages 8 and 3. I am determined to set the very best example for them and earn my nursing degree. But I need your help to get there! If this reaches 1,000 people &amp; each donates $3-$4 it CAN &amp; WILL be done before class starts this semester! :) </p>
<p>***  HINT: Skip to the ""PAY IT FORWARD"" bullet point for the really good stuff. ***</p>
<h3>The Break Down</h3>
<p>Due to financial aid requirement changes since I was last enrolled in college over 3 years ago, I must successfully complete 21 credits without financial aid before enrolling in a nursing program using full aid, scholarships, and grants. I am currently ENROLLED in the courses below. I will take the additional 6 credits next semester (only 2, 3 credit courses remain for the certificate to transfer.) </p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abnormal Psychology - 3.0 credits - $437.20</li>
<li>College Technical Math 1A - 3.0 credits - $407.20</li>
<li>Contemporary American Society - 3.0 credits - $437.20</li>
<li>General Biology - 4.0 credits - $563.60</li>
<li>Technical Writing - 3.0 credits - $407.20</li>

</ul><p>Total Tuition for 16 credits: $2,252.40  ...with books &amp; materials: $2,952.40</p>
<h3>Paying It Forward &amp; The Grand Plan</h3>

<li>Refresher course &amp; renewal of my CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant) license</li>
</ul><p>So I can....</p>

<li>Finacially support my family while I am in school AND</li>
<li>PAY IT FORWARD by donating $100 per month (in $25 weekly incriments) to other causes listed right here on indiegogo until the final campaign amount has been ""repaid""! The more money I raise, the more comes back to fund other awesome causes.</li>
<li>August 7 Update: I'll start a blog to track thee repayment of donations &amp; post the link here as soon as it's up &amp; running. </li>

¿Qué es y
cómo surge math2me.com?
En Marzo de
2009 Alejandro Andalón y Maria González fundaron el sitio math2me.com (antes
asesoriasdematematicas.com) donde los estudiantes pueden accesar a
materiales gratuitos en video en el área de matemáticas de nivel secundaria,
preparatoria y sistema abierto (educación para adultos) acorde a los planes de
estudio en México, esperamos en un futuro contar con la currícula de
estudio de cada país. O acceder directamente al tema que les interese Algebra,
Geometría Analítica, Trigonometría, Aritmética, Geometría Euclidiana,
Estadística, Probabilidad, Calculo Diferencial, Análisis de Funciones, Series y
Sucesiones, Olimpiadas y Guías de Estudio.
Actualmente
la página contiene +970 videos de diversos temas de matemáticas en formato HD
con la posibilidad de descargarlos gratuitamente para su estudio, distribuirlos
por redes sociales, descargar la aplicación gratuita para Ipod touch y Iphone.
Hasta Abril de 2011 tenemos +3,400,000 vistas a los videos y actualmente
trabajamos en la traducción al idioma inglés y sección de ejercicios en línea.
Todos los servicios de la página son gratuitos.
En
math2me.com el alumno puede buscar información sobre un tema visto en clase que
le interese repasar, puede adelantarse en sus materias preparándose con
anticipación, puede nivelarse si tiene problemas en un tema o materia, con la
ventaja de revisar en material las veces que sea necesario, sin importar
horario o día de la semana o del año. Una persona adulta de igual forma puede
entrar para recordar un tema, para repasar información, para prepararse en
general o incluso regresar a o terminar algún curso.
 
Impacto
social
Alrededor de
25,000 reproducciones diarias recibimos en math2me.com, nuestra intención es
atender el doble de estudiantes y resolver sus dudas. Sin embargo, aun tenemos
varios temas sin terminar y cuando se trabaja  con equipo o en condiciones
no adecuadas se hace mas difícil la sustentabilidad de math2me.com.
 
Es por eso
que insistimos en pedir su apoyo a nuestra causa que es la causa de muchos
alumnos que diariamente se comunican con nosotros para decirnos en todo lo que
se les ha ayudado como
pasar exámenes, exámenes finales, exámenes de admisión o
salvar la materia, así como maestros que les ha servido este material
para mostrarles a sus alumnos formas alternativas de estudio o como complemento
a la clase.
 
Sin tu ayuda,
no podremos ayudar a tantos estudiantes que lo que necesitan es una herramienta
de estudio para salir adelante, no tendremos la capacidad de brindar un
servicio de ejercicios para que los alumnos puedan autoevaluarse y poner a su
disposición aplicaciones de dispositivos móviles para que vean los videos sin
necesidad de una computadora.
 
¿Por qué
necesitamos tu apoyo?
 
Para poder
comprar y/cubrir los gastos:
- Cámara de
video semi-profesional HD. Nos interesa tener una cámara en la que no
utilicemos cassets ya que gastamos mucho mas dinero en eso, el tiempo que se
utiliza pasando el video del casset a la computadora es demasiado y mejorar la
calidad de la imagen.
 -
Luces. Para tener una buena calidad en la imagen de los videos ya que se tiene
que trabajar con un solo foco que no ayuda para nada, además del tiempo que
toma acomodar este foco y que no sobreexponga el video.
- Micrófono
de alta calidad en la que no se escuche todo lo que pase alrededor, sino las
clases.
- Se necesita
atender situaciones legales de math2me.com como convertirnos en una Asociación
Civil.
- Crear las
aplicaciones para iphone, ipod, blackberry, ipad, android.
- Desarrollar
la sección de ejercicios para que además de aprender con los videos los
usuarios tengan la posibilidad de practicar lo que ven. 
- Se
necesitan 2 laptops para editar videos, subirlos a Internet, trabajar en el
diseño, realizar programación y demás.
- Disco duro
de 4 TB.
 
¡Te
necesitamos!
Por favor
ayúdanos con tu donativo para cumplir con nuestra meta y seguir realizando esta
labor de una mejor y mas eficiente manera. Recuerda distribuir este
video con al menos 5 personas. Entre todos podemos lograrlo.
 
En otras
ocasiones hemos solicitado prestamos al gobierno o bancos para continuar con la
pagina de Internet, pero lo único que ha pasado es que nos hemos llenado de
deudas y ahora la única solución es contar con su aportación.
 
GRACIAS.

What is math2me.com? 
On March 2009
Alejandro Andalón and Maria González founded the website
asesoriasdematematicas.com (now becaming math2me.com since April 2011) where
students can access to free math videos in Spanish from different subjects of
grades 7 to grade 12 and continuing education for adults: Algebra, Analytic
Geometry, Trigonometry, Arithmetic, Euclidean Geometry, Statistics,
Probability, Differential calculus, Analysis of Functions, Math Olympiad and
Study Guides for tests. 
Currently
math2me contains more than +970 math videos and some of them in HD format with
the option of free download for study them and free application for iPod touch
and iPhone. 
We have
+3,700,000 views in our youtube videos and we expected increase this number
with the translation in English language and the exercise section online. All
our services we want to keep them for free.
Social impact 
Math2me.com
receives around 25,000 daily
views (until April 2011), but we want to double this number and still help them
answer their doubts via Facebook or math2me.com. However, we still have
several delay issues a consequence of our current conditions that it makes more
difficult to continue working in math2me. Without your help and
support, we won’t be able to help the amount of students that need this website
as a tool of study, create more applications for mobile devices and create the
practice section soon.
 Why we need your support?   To purchase and / pay:-  Semi-pro camcorder. Currently we used miniDV format that we
spend a lot time and money than HD digital format.  
- Light set. We have been using commercial bulbs and
manual adaptations that they do not allow us work properly with the image
video. 
- High quality
microphone. To reduce the noise that it is around, and be more focus in the
lesson instead of the noise. 
-  Paper work. Formal situation of
math2me.com as non-profit organization. 
-
Develop applications. Blackberry, Ipad and Android. 
-
Develop practice section. Allow to students practice and learn online.
-
Upgrade our computers. We want to buy 2 new laptops to work faster in the
edition and design.
- Hard Drive 4
TB. Storage purpose.   We
need you! 
Please help us
with your donation to reach our goal and continue to make this work better and
more efficient. 
Remember
distribute this video with at least 5 friends. Together we can do it.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Sarus Exchange Program promotes peace and understanding between Cambodia and Vietnam by offering youth leaders from the two countries a deeply collaborative, personally transformative exchange. Sarus brings together twenty university students annually, ten from each country, for a month of physically and mentally demanding service and study. In regular group meetings students reflect, share insights and handle conflict productively.<strong> </strong>Our goal is to build connections for cross-border cooperation between future leaders in the two countries.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Beginning in March and running through August, Sarus Exchange has three components: orientation and training, the exchange program, and individual community education projects. During orientation and training each country group of ten students prepares for the July exchange through work with personal research mentors and by attending a series of seminars, field trips and service opportunities with a local orphanage. During the July exchange students live together for two weeks in each country, construct rural development projects, continue to mentor disadvantaged children, and embark on cultural research excursions. Returning from the intensive exchange, students come home to complete community education projects. In August, they present their research, learning, service and exchange experiences in their home communities, extending their learning to peers, friends, family and the greater public. Young women and men ages eighteen to twenty-two participate equally in Sarus, and all are student leaders at their respective universities in Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>

<p><em><strong>In order to run the 2012 program, we need to raise $10,000 by June 1.</strong></em></p>

It will also partially cover the costs of construction projects that our students complete for our project partners in both countries.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Sarus operates on break-even budget, and we do not waste a single penny. The program director receives no compensation for his work. The staff earn a modest stipend, which accounts for less than ten percent of programs costs. All staff have other full time jobs to support themselves. For all of us at Sarus, we do this work because we can see the incredible impact it has on our students, and we believe in the value of promoting peace between Cambodia and Vietnam. As a contributor to Sarus, you can be confident that your money is being used frugally and wisely. We will be happy to provide more financial details about Sarus upon request.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Sarus Exchange successfully addresses a largely unmet, singular need: peace and mutual understanding between Cambodians and Vietnamese.  Fighting between the two countries has been taking place for centuries with open war as recently the 1980s. There is real possibility of renewed, open conflict in the event of an economic crisis or a shift in the delicate political balance between the countries. As waves of open-minded alumni become young leaders, they can draw on these experiences to positively influence policies and public opinion of the other country.</p>
<p>Sarus’ 2011 inaugural year <a href=""http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011072250584/Lifestyle/hands-across-the-border.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exceeded expectations</a>. Among the first group of Sarus exchange students, over eighty percent had never before left their home country. On the personal and group levels students became more confident and open to communicating and working in teams towards their community service goals. Students constructed two latrines at a rural Cambodian orphanage and a floodwall for an underserved urban school in Vietnam. Each Sarus participant spent over one hundred hours mentoring children in both countries. En route to forging deep, cross-cultural bonds, students completed independent research projects focused on each other’s countries. Topics were as varied and vibrant as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Max4sE_zLKw&amp;feature=related"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">student personalities</a>, ranging from a comparative study of social media use in the two countries, to an analysis of the impact the garment industry has had on traditional clothing.</p>
<p>One month after the program’s end, completely independent from any Sarus support, sixteen of twenty-one Sarus Alumni reunited at their first joint service site, the OCTO orphanage in Cambodia. This student-initiated service trip speaks to the lasting bonds formed during the exchange program, the budding leadership and cooperation among students, and their enduring commitment to community development. </p>
<p>We have substantial momentum moving forward into the 2012 exchange. All original staff remain, and we have hired three alumni as program assistants, a testament to both Sarus’ dedication to our students, and their enthusiasm for the Sarus Exchange Program. Our staff is a driven team of young Cambodians and Vietnamese, efficient because of their strong leadership skills and first-hand knowledge of the Sarus model. Staff are compensated for their efforts, but at a wage far below the standard for qualified graduates, leaving the majority of their efforts as in-kind donations.</p>
<p>The 2012 applicant pool was larger and more competitive, signaling growth and a trajectory towards even greater results in coming years. It is important that our programming both support and enhance our students’ primary educational pursuits. To this end, Sarus has already begun implementation of a Research Advisor program, pairing individual students with native English speakers qualified to help guide and assess student learning. A curriculum review of Sarus is also underway, with the end goal of further tailoring an already successful research course to meet the specific needs of Sarus students. This focus on increased academic rigor and support will assure that students are pushed and motivated to conduct high quality independent research.</p>
<p>In short, we are a group of young people who have committed our time and resources to  promoting peace between Cambodia and Vietnam. We have a proven concept and are in the process of improving it.  All we need to keep this program going is your support.</p>

Lawdible is an Open Source software project that will help users and grass roots organizations manage the process of creating “Model Legislation"" that can potentially become a law. The software will be apolitical (not favor any party or group) and will be free for anyone to download and use.
My goal for the Lawdible project is to create a working application and use that application to create a “draft bill” that I will submit to a local state representative for consideration in becoming a law.
Lawdible – Derived from the word Laudible meaning praiseworthy.
The lawdible system will help Grass Roots Organizations create Model Legislation by enabling them to: Research, Recruit, Draft, Submit, Promote & Share draft legislation.
The Need: Participation in creating and Modifying rules that govern your life.

</div><div> <p><b>MENTORSHIP</b></p>
<p>We believe, “if she can see it, she can be it.” That’s why we go great lengths to connect girls with our amazing female athlete Mentors (mostly collegiate level athletes or better). Over the course of ZGiRLS, girls gain perspective that can only come from someone who knows exactly what they’re going through. The relationship instills inspiration that lasts well beyond the Circle’s last Huddle.<br/></p>
<p><b>EDUCATION</b></p>
<p>The ZGiRLS Compass Curriculum™ covers a range of topics, from mental awareness and body image, to stress management and goal-setting. A typical ZGiRLS Huddle includes short videos, discussions, self-reflective workbook exercises, and group activities. Girls <em>apply </em>and <em>practice</em> new ZGiRLS skills in between huddles with their “ZWORK” homework.<br/></p>
<p><b>SUPPORT</b></p>
<p>ZGiRLS isn’t just a program – it’s a community, a resource, and a movement. Our eight-month annual program is designed to provide the continuity and reinforcement kids need to internalize new mental/emotional skills. From our parent workbooks and webinars, to our online articles, ZGiRLS is just as committed to supporting parents, coaches, and our Mentors, as we are to empowering girls.<br/></p>

<p>Round up a group of 5-9 “sporty” girls ages
11-16 who are about the same age, preferably in the same sport. Designate a ""Circle Captain"" within your group of parents (or a coach). The Circle Captain is responsible for making sure that every participant within their Circle completes her registration. In September,
ZGiRLS sends each Circle a kit of curriculums and pairs the Circle with a
certified ZGiRLS Mentor in their area. Circles meet (“huddle”) with their
Mentor once per month from October through May, progressing through the
curriculum with the guidance and support of the nationwide ZGiRLS community.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>Why does ZGiRLS work with girls in sports? Because it’s a huge population (6.8 million to be exact) and the statistics surrounding the benefits of sports are convincing: girls who do sports have higher self-esteem, are more likely to go to college, and in adulthood, they are more likely to rise into leadership roles. ZGiRLS supports girls in sports, so that they <i>stay</i> in sports.<br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>2.  LIFE SKILLS</b></p>
<p>The Compass Curriculum™ teaches a wide variety of life-skills that prepare girls for success not only in their sport, but more importantly, in life. Valuable skills like goal-setting, stress management, communication, and positive self-talk can be transformational for young athletes, but most sports programs and coaches don’t have the time to teach these vital lessons. In ZGiRLS, girls don’t only learn about life-skills, they embody and practice them.<br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>3.  EMPOWERMENT</b></p>
<p>From our uplifting culture, to our nationwide community, every ZGiRL has the inspiration and tools she needs to take control of her life and chase down her dreams. ZGiRLS across the country are united by a shared attitude of positivity and progress: ZERO limitations! Nothing holds a ZGiRL back from realizing her full potential.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>SPORTS + LIFE SKILLS + EMPOWERMENT = </strong><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">a confident, centered,

</p><p><br/></p></div>","Founded by Olympic and NCAA athletes, ZGiRLS equips girls in sports with the tools & perspective they need to be CONFIDENT, CENTERED, & COURAGEOUS.
Every ZGiRLS Circle is matched with an inspirational female athlete Mentor in their area. Circles meet with their Mentor once per month from October through May.
 Female athletes everywhere agree: more girls need access to ZGiRLS!




After three years, we know one thing for sure:  ZGiRLS works. 
Participants walk away empowered, parents notice their daughters carrying themselves with more confidence, and Mentors LOVE volunteering for ZGiRLS.





So, what now? Help us bring ZGiRLS to girls across the country!







First and foremost, we need PARTICIPANTS because, well, without them, we wouldn't have any Circles… without MENTORS, we can’t deliver our proven curriculum... and without FUNDING, we can’t provide our amazing programming. You can help make ZGiRLS' national expansion possible!



PARTICIPANTS. One of the things that makes this campaign unique, is that parents can purchase early-bird ZGiRLS registration. Yep, even though 2015 ZGiRLS registration doesn't officially open until July 1st, parents can lock-in an early-bird registration fee right here on this campaign page. When this campaign closes, we will tell all early-bird registrants how to complete their registration on the ZGiRLS website. Do you know some parents of teenage girls? Let them know about this opportunity! (Trust us, they'll thank you later)


MENTORS. Chances are, you got to this page because someone sent you the link or you saw it online somewhere... Chances are, you also probably know some pretty awesome athletic women. Put the power of the internet, together with the amazing female athletes you know, and please help spread the word about ZGiRLS. Share this campaign so that we can grow our awesome team of female athlete mentors!
FUNDING! We are a startup nonprofit, and there's no way around it: we need money. We are committed to providing 10% of all ZGiRLS programs completely pro bono to girls who otherwise wouldn't have access... Not to mention, developing curricula, making instructional videos, and hosting webinars doesn't come without a cost. Every single dollar counts. Please BACK this campaign! Your contribution will make a difference.


Let us help you get a Circle started… TODAY! ZGiRLS will only be hosting 200 Circles across the country this year, so be sure to snag a registration spot via this campaign before it closes June 30th! Curious how this will work? Here’s a simple explanation:



HERE'S WHAT YOU GET BY PURCHASING A REGISTRATION PERK:

You do not need your Circle Captain or all of your Circle members nailed down before purchasing the perk!  Lock-in your daughter's spot by purchasing the registration perk today, then you can work on rounding up the other Circle members and identifying the Circle Captain over the next few weeks. 





 MENTORSHIP
We believe, “if she can see it, she can be it.” That’s why we go great lengths to connect girls with our amazing female athlete Mentors (mostly collegiate level athletes or better). Over the course of ZGiRLS, girls gain perspective that can only come from someone who knows exactly what they’re going through. The relationship instills inspiration that lasts well beyond the Circle’s last Huddle.
EDUCATION
The ZGiRLS Compass Curriculum™ covers a range of topics, from mental awareness and body image, to stress management and goal-setting. A typical ZGiRLS Huddle includes short videos, discussions, self-reflective workbook exercises, and group activities. Girls apply and practice new ZGiRLS skills in between huddles with their “ZWORK” homework.
SUPPORT
ZGiRLS isn’t just a program – it’s a community, a resource, and a movement. Our eight-month annual program is designed to provide the continuity and reinforcement kids need to internalize new mental/emotional skills. From our parent workbooks and webinars, to our online articles, ZGiRLS is just as committed to supporting parents, coaches, and our Mentors, as we are to empowering girls.
    









Round up a group of 5-9 “sporty” girls ages
11-16 who are about the same age, preferably in the same sport. Designate a ""Circle Captain"" within your group of parents (or a coach). The Circle Captain is responsible for making sure that every participant within their Circle completes her registration. In September,
ZGiRLS sends each Circle a kit of curriculums and pairs the Circle with a
certified ZGiRLS Mentor in their area. Circles meet (“huddle”) with their
Mentor once per month from October through May, progressing through the
curriculum with the guidance and support of the nationwide ZGiRLS community.

Want more information about ZGiRLS? Perfect, we want to tell you more. Just go to our WEBSITE where we spell out everything you need to know to start and run a ZGiRLS Circle!



 1.  SPORTS
Why does ZGiRLS work with girls in sports? Because it’s a huge population (6.8 million to be exact) and the statistics surrounding the benefits of sports are convincing: girls who do sports have higher self-esteem, are more likely to go to college, and in adulthood, they are more likely to rise into leadership roles. ZGiRLS supports girls in sports, so that they stay in sports.

2.  LIFE SKILLS
The Compass Curriculum™ teaches a wide variety of life-skills that prepare girls for success not only in their sport, but more importantly, in life. Valuable skills like goal-setting, stress management, communication, and positive self-talk can be transformational for young athletes, but most sports programs and coaches don’t have the time to teach these vital lessons. In ZGiRLS, girls don’t only learn about life-skills, they embody and practice them.

3.  EMPOWERMENT
From our uplifting culture, to our nationwide community, every ZGiRL has the inspiration and tools she needs to take control of her life and chase down her dreams. ZGiRLS across the country are united by a shared attitude of positivity and progress: ZERO limitations! Nothing holds a ZGiRL back from realizing her full potential.


SPORTS + LIFE SKILLS + EMPOWERMENT = a confident, centered,
courageous ZGiRL






    
From media pressure to “mean girls,” ZGiRLS acknowledges that girls encounter a wide variety of external limitations. These obstacles are real, but rather than focusing our energy there, ZGiRLS chooses to turn within. ZGiRLS gives girls the tools they need to overcome their own internal barriers (the self-doubt, fear, and insecurity) so that they can navigate adolescence and graduate into adulthood with flourishing confidence, self-worth, and ambition… To live with ZERO internal limitations!Your charitable contribution can help ZGiRLS make immediate impact on girls' lives. The perks listed in the right sidebar highlight the many programs, projects, and scholarships that your generous contributions will help make possible. As a 501(c)(3) organization, the perks – or a portion of the perk's value – are tax-deductible. For more details, please review our FAQ at the bottom of this page.ZGiRLS was founded by Olympic and NCAA All-American athletes. Alongside our awesome Athlete Advisory Board (packed with professional athletes like Sue Bird, Gabby Reece, and Summer Sanders), our Professional Advisory Board (complete with psychologists, counselors, and curriculum developers), and our helpful Parent Advisory Board, our team is passionate about empowering and elevating the next generation of girls.

For more information about our transformational curriculum, be sure to check out our WEBSITE.Wondering what the girls do at Huddles besides hang out with their Mentor?

<p>Our Youth Group, at First Parish, is in its 10<sup>th</sup>
year and is made up of high school students from Needham, Massachusetts and
surrounding communities.  Our group
provides opportunities for youth to connect, explore healthy personal choices,
build community, and live out our organization's principles, most visibly
through social justice and service work.<br/>
</p>
<p>Each
year, the Youth Group raises funds to travel somewhere we can volunteer with
local organizations working to make a difference in their communities. In April
2015, we are excited to be traveling to Eastern Tennessee for a week, where the
youth will do a variety of projects related to environmentalism and nature in
Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  <br/></p>

<p></p> </div> <div style=""""> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>The youth at First Parish work year long on fundraising efforts that help with the cost of housing and food for 15 youth and chaperones.  Our campaign goal to raise $2000 will help cover additional costs associated with the trip, like transportation to Tennessee from Massachusetts, gas, and other incidentals. 
Any assistance from our friends, families, and others will go a long way in helping us
to be excellent ambassadors of First Parish in Needham and wonderful examples
of the power and compassion of Youth everywhere.</p>
<p></p>
</div> <div style=""""> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>While the youth give significantly in their time and labor,
the benefits of this service trip are immense and lasting for us as well.  We gain tremendous insight and empathy
for a community that is quite different from our own and begin to understand
the role that issues like race and class play in creating inequities.  In fact, we are often inspired to take

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Our Youth Group, at First Parish, is in its 10th
year and is made up of high school students from Needham, Massachusetts and
surrounding communities.  Our group
provides opportunities for youth to connect, explore healthy personal choices,
build community, and live out our organization's principles, most visibly
through social justice and service work.

Each
year, the Youth Group raises funds to travel somewhere we can volunteer with
local organizations working to make a difference in their communities. In April
2015, we are excited to be traveling to Eastern Tennessee for a week, where the
youth will do a variety of projects related to environmentalism and nature in
Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  



   What We Need
 
The youth at First Parish work year long on fundraising efforts that help with the cost of housing and food for 15 youth and chaperones.  Our campaign goal to raise $2000 will help cover additional costs associated with the trip, like transportation to Tennessee from Massachusetts, gas, and other incidentals. 
Any assistance from our friends, families, and others will go a long way in helping us
to be excellent ambassadors of First Parish in Needham and wonderful examples
of the power and compassion of Youth everywhere.

  The Impact While the youth give significantly in their time and labor,
the benefits of this service trip are immense and lasting for us as well.  We gain tremendous insight and empathy
for a community that is quite different from our own and begin to understand
the role that issues like race and class play in creating inequities.  In fact, we are often inspired to take
up with further social justice work when we return home and many of graduates
of our youth program actively seek out volunteer and professional work where
they can continue to be a positive force for social change.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>explain3D - explain in 3D, how things work</h3>
<p>Goal of the project is to create system of educational simulations, where people can play with basic mechanisms and tools in 3D environment and understand, how things work. System is using principles of game based learning and interactive education, so learning how car engine works is like playing Need for speed. System will be motivating young people to technical education and making technical education and technical and vocational education and training fun and more interesting.</p>
<h3>Where are we now?</h3>
<p>We have created prototype of system with first simulations. 3 of these simulations were based on suggestions of educators. Currently, the system has only 10 simulations.

</h3> <p>The Poetry Center of Chicago is a non-profit organization that has been providing public poetry readings since 1974. For the past twenty years, the PCC has provided the Hands On Stanzas program for Chicago Public Schools. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336379/files/20150329115228-genevieve.jpg?1427655148"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hands On Stanzas sends Chicago poets into classrooms for twenty-week residencies. Over the course of a residency, each Poet-In-Residence develops a strong relationship with their students, building trust and encouraging self-expression. <br/></p>
<p>Each session involves reading published poetry and asking students to write and perform their own original poetry. Our Poets In Residence publish exceptional student poems weekly on the <a href=""http://www.poetrycenter.org/hands-on-stanzas/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">residency blogs</a>. <br/></p>

<p>Each year, our students show not only an increase in literacy and comprehension, but they self-report increased confidence in reading, writing, and self-expression. Weekly publications of their work help students see the value in their creative thinking and allow them to share their poems with family, teachers, and the community. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>Our program provides a number of creative cultural opportunities outside of the classroom as well. Last year, our students performed in a Teen Poetry Reading at the Chicago Public Library's beautiful Harold Washington Library, and last month our students performed original poems live on stage at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra!</p>
<p>Every year, we honor our talented students at the All Schools Reading, a final celebration of a year of poetry well done. One student from each residency classroom reads in the beautiful Claudia Cassidy theater at the Chicago Cultural Center. <a href=""http://www.poetrycenter.org/hands-on-stanzas-student-poets-live-at-the-chicago-cultural-center/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We invite you to come see our program in action!

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact of Empowering Creative Voices<br/>
</h3> <p>Our program creates passion in our students, an outlet for expression, and the confidence to find their voices. We all know being young is tough, even in the best circumstances. And in a testing-focused environment, Hands On Stanzas is sometimes the only moment of creative expression during a regular school day. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
 The Poetry Center of Chicago is a non-profit organization that has been providing public poetry readings since 1974. For the past twenty years, the PCC has provided the Hands On Stanzas program for Chicago Public Schools. 


Hands On Stanzas sends Chicago poets into classrooms for twenty-week residencies. Over the course of a residency, each Poet-In-Residence develops a strong relationship with their students, building trust and encouraging self-expression. 
Each session involves reading published poetry and asking students to write and perform their own original poetry. Our Poets In Residence publish exceptional student poems weekly on the residency blogs. 



Each year, our students show not only an increase in literacy and comprehension, but they self-report increased confidence in reading, writing, and self-expression. Weekly publications of their work help students see the value in their creative thinking and allow them to share their poems with family, teachers, and the community. 


Our program provides a number of creative cultural opportunities outside of the classroom as well. Last year, our students performed in a Teen Poetry Reading at the Chicago Public Library's beautiful Harold Washington Library, and last month our students performed original poems live on stage at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra!
Every year, we honor our talented students at the All Schools Reading, a final celebration of a year of poetry well done. One student from each residency classroom reads in the beautiful Claudia Cassidy theater at the Chicago Cultural Center. We invite you to come see our program in action! April 29th, 5:30 - 7pm, Claudia Cassidy Theater, Chicago Cultural Center, 78 East Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois.


This year, Hands On Stanzas has residencies in over 30 classrooms, writing poetry with nearly 1,000 students. With your help, we look forward to working with even more students next year!



  The Impact of Empowering Creative Voices
 Our program creates passion in our students, an outlet for expression, and the confidence to find their voices. We all know being young is tough, even in the best circumstances. And in a testing-focused environment, Hands On Stanzas is sometimes the only moment of creative expression during a regular school day. 


You already know the research on how creative thinking and 
expression improve so many of our skills. So instead, here's a few folks on what the program means to them:









  Our Challenges Funding a non-profit is always a challenge. The Poetry Center has survived 40 years of ups and downs, and we are ready to face the next 40 providing important services to Chicago's students. 
Our biggest challenge right now is to spread the word. If you believe in this campaign, please tell people about it, and extend awareness of our program. 

  Spread The Word & Help Our Community Grow!
 Helping us spread the word is vital and in return receives our endless gratitude! If you feel Hands On Stanzas provides a valuable service to the community please spread the word: talk to your friends and family about us, share the campaign page via email and social media. Spreading our base is a crucial part of crowdfunding this community service.
Insider tip! Using the share buttons on this campaign page (you'll find them on the left side or at the top of the page) lets Indiegogo know that we have fans. Thanks, team!

<h3><em>He will not be able to complete his course of study without our help!</em></h3>
<p>(Texte en français au bas de la page)</p>
<p><img alt=""HichamandJoanie"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/3539_10152655888095459_467561198_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""HichamandJoanie""/></p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The story</span></h3>
<p>In 2009, my travels led me to Morocco, where I was blessed to stay with a wonderful family and where I truly connected with a new brother, Hicham. Thanks to them, I felt nurtured in the midst of what became a big life transition. Through my unsettling culture shock, Hicham offered guidance and helped me to grow as an individual. Ever since then, we have kept contact like members of a real family. Today, my brother needs my help, but I cannot do it alone.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A little more about Hicham</span></h3>
<p>Above all, Hicham is dedicated to offering local children accessible eye care and his greatest dream is to be of service in his hometown, near his parents and siblings, and start a family of his own.  Since I’ve known him, Hicham has used every opportunity to volunteer in his community and help anyone he is able to (including me).  A passionate and intelligent 29 year old, he is now focused on studying orthoptics, a type of vision therapy that has never been taught in Morocco before. As part of a pioneering cohort of students, he will work with children with eye muscle disorders, widening the range of treatment options where accessibility to healthcare can be a challenge.   </p>

The story
In 2009, my travels led me to Morocco, where I was blessed to stay with a wonderful family and where I truly connected with a new brother, Hicham. Thanks to them, I felt nurtured in the midst of what became a big life transition. Through my unsettling culture shock, Hicham offered guidance and helped me to grow as an individual. Ever since then, we have kept contact like members of a real family. Today, my brother needs my help, but I cannot do it alone.
 
A little more about Hicham
Above all, Hicham is dedicated to offering local children accessible eye care and his greatest dream is to be of service in his hometown, near his parents and siblings, and start a family of his own.  Since I’ve known him, Hicham has used every opportunity to volunteer in his community and help anyone he is able to (including me).  A passionate and intelligent 29 year old, he is now focused on studying orthoptics, a type of vision therapy that has never been taught in Morocco before. As part of a pioneering cohort of students, he will work with children with eye muscle disorders, widening the range of treatment options where accessibility to healthcare can be a challenge.   
 
The financial reality
Amazingly, $300 USD/CAD per month pays for tuition, rent, food and transportation for Hicham while he’s studying in Rabat. He has tried everything to find funding, but things don’t work the same way in Morocco. There are no such things as student loans or student jobs. We are his only option now. Really, what is $300 for us? Or even $100? And $10? He needs our help for 18 months of school, so let’s raise $5400 together and allow him to pursue his dream!
 
Why give today? 
To help my brother, to help me, and to allow a dream to come true.  Once we have understood what it means to rely on another person during a trying time, we are eager to return the love that was shown to us.  With the solution at the tip of my fingers, I’m asking you to give today.  For him to be able to help kids in his community.  For him to have a family of his own. To pass along to others the kindnesses shown to us.
 
Every little bit helps!
 
Thank you sincerely

<p>The families came and our staff was ready!  We took the liberties of designing our curriculum with a community focus.  In addition to our developmentally appropriate practices for acedemic support, once per week a community visitor comes and shares a talent with us.  We go on field trips that bring our themes together and residents often volunteer on a regular basis for 1:1 tutoring.  We are always learning and laughing and doing and learning some more!  Quickly, we achieved a 5 star rating from the state.</p>
<p>However, one year into the project we experienced the massive cuts to education and child care programs and immediately began our own Community Scholarship Program.  We help families raise the funds needed to stay enrolled through community events like the annual Trailfest, Appalachian Heritage Festival, French Broad River Festival Kids Village, 5K Runs, and of course Bingo and Bake Sales!  We have teamed up with our local businesses and churches, but there are always more children to serve than costs to do so. </p>
<p>The best part about our program though is that it is a 'give and take' style agenda.  We raise funds and the parents perform the maintenance tasks that help our Center run smoothly.  They earn 'credits' towards their tuition and HSCLC in turn does not have to pay out the maintenance costs for hauling trash, mowing the lawn, doing the sheets, and cleaning the facility.  Everyone wins, especially the children. </p>
<p>Each year we run an annual Pledge Drive from August 1st - the 15th to help secure the amount of money we can promise out for the school year.  It is estimated that we will need $4000 to help our families in need to fund the out of school care expenses this coming school year.  </p>
<p><strong>Good for YOU</strong><br/><br/>Since Hot Springs is such a sweet little destination vacation place (and because our town is so supportive of its local Learning Center) we are prepared to offer 'perks' for supporting us this year:  Soak in the natural mineral spring water hot tubs along the French Broad River, get a free pass to the annual French Broad River Fall Festival, or stay 2 nights in a cozy cabin on an organic farm with natural mineral spring water hot tubs on the porch!  These kinds of perks will help you get a good sense of the kind of environment our darlings get to grow up in!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Having been open now for four years we have actual data to support the concept that <em>learning through doing</em> is extremely effective.  Our students get the 1:1 help that they need from knowledgeable, professional people and they are SUCEEDING in their educational endeavors.  We have graduated 32 children from our Transitional Kindergarten program and are now watching them soar.  We host 48 amazing children in the 5 - 12 year old age range with after school and summer camps and witness them use problem solving skills to navigate issues while earning one award after another in their classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand that some people just can’t contribute money, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>We have started our own thrift store called <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Community-Thrift/234151133369576"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Community Thrift</a>, so shopping and/or providing gently used items are a great way to help us generate funds while providing a great community service of having affordable goods for sale.  We take used books, clothes, housewares, toys, etc. every day of the week except Sunday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, most everyone has something that they are good at, so we are always inviting people over to share their skill or talent with the children.  This expands their thinking and makes them smarter!  We'd love to learn something from you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another great way to contribute is to help us with our 1:1 tutoring sessions.  Retired teachers and clergy are great candidates for this. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dr Abiodun Jonathan was a Pediatrician and pastor before his life was suddenly and violently cut short in the ill-fated Dana Airline on June 3, 2012. His widow, Funmi is now saddled with the task of raising their three kids as a single mother. Before his death Dr Jonathan worked as a neonatologist taking care neonates in a fertility center in Abuja, Nigeria and as a the Central Pediatric Advisor at International Centre For Aids Care And Treatment Program, ICAP.</p>
<p>Those who know him know how passionate he was about the wellbeing of other people’s children and how much he invested in this. Now his kids are without their breadwinner and at a risk of falling short of their maximum potential.</p>
<p>Biodun was a very close friend of mine and I felt moved to do something for him to smile over in his grave. At least he would'nt have to worry that the family he left behind would go through difficult times because of his untimely death.</p>
<p>Please join me to raise an endowment fund that will be used to fund Abiodun Jonathan’s children’s education. The funds raised will be invested in a mutual fund in the name of the children.</p>
<p>I also plan to make a book of rememberance for him ...the least i could do to keep his loving memory alive!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Dr Abiodun Jonathan was a Pediatrician and pastor before his life was suddenly and violently cut short in the ill-fated Dana Airline on June 3, 2012. His widow, Funmi is now saddled with the task of raising their three kids as a single mother. Before his death Dr Jonathan worked as a neonatologist taking care neonates in a fertility center in Abuja, Nigeria and as a the Central Pediatric Advisor at International Centre For Aids Care And Treatment Program, ICAP.
Those who know him know how passionate he was about the wellbeing of other people’s children and how much he invested in this. Now his kids are without their breadwinner and at a risk of falling short of their maximum potential.
Biodun was a very close friend of mine and I felt moved to do something for him to smile over in his grave. At least he would'nt have to worry that the family he left behind would go through difficult times because of his untimely death.
Please join me to raise an endowment fund that will be used to fund Abiodun Jonathan’s children’s education. The funds raised will be invested in a mutual fund in the name of the children.
I also plan to make a book of rememberance for him ...the least i could do to keep his loving memory alive!
Thank you for your support

We are Kids for Kenya, a group of students from Rosedale Heights School of the Arts.

<p><strong>What’s the goal?</strong></p>
<p>Raise $3,800 to send my Ghanaian friend Jey to the University of Ghana for 3 years so that he can earn his bachelor’s degree in Afforestation (the conservation and reintroduction of plant life in barren areas).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is Jey?</strong></p>
<p>Jey is a 28-year-old Ghanaian man who lives in Accra.  His father passed away when he was 9 and he grew up in a single mother household, polishing shoes on the street until he was 16 to help support his family.  He made it all the way through high school (earning good grades), but was unable to continue into college because of a lack of funds.  He’s smart, caring, good-natured, and passionate about education.  Right now, Jey lives hand-to-mouth selling handmade bracelets and necklaces to tourists who stay at or near The Rising Phoenix Hotel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where does your Money Go?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Jey’s Tuition &amp; Housing Costs for 3 Years</li>
<li>3 annual allowances for Jey to purchase books, school supplies, new clothes, and cover basic needs</li>
<li>Printing &amp; Shipping costs for ‘Wisdom’ Tees</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Traveler...</strong></p>
<p>Hi!  My name is Justin Dart and I’m a soon-to-be senior business student at the University of Colorado.  A little over a month ago, I set foot off the MV Explorer in San Diego having completed a Semester at Sea and traveled through 11 different countries.  It was the most challenging and intense (not to mention fast-paced) environment I’ve ever been in.  I’ve never felt so many high highs and so many humbling lows in just over 100 days.  I’ve come out of SAS more sure of who I am and the kind of person that I wish to become than I’ve ever been in my life.  For these reasons and the fact that I got an opportunity to take a voyage like that, I am incredibly blessed.  Thank you for taking a look at ‘Teach a Man,’ I hope you like what you see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Program</strong></p>
<p>SAS is a nonprofit program run by The Institute of Shipboard Education that recruits college students from all over the world and sends them on a circumnavigation of the globe aboard the MV Explorer (our traveling campus) twice a year.  We took classes full-time on the ship and traveled in country at each new port.  Simply put, “the world is our classroom.”  The spring 2012 voyage journeyed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nassau, Bahamas</li>
<li>Rosseau, Dominica</li>
<li>Manaus, Brazil</li>
<li>Tema, Ghana</li>
<li>Cape Town, South Africa</li>
<li>Port Louis, Mauritius</li>
<li>Cochin, India</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Saigon, Vietnam</li>
<li>Hong Kong</li>
<li>Shanghai, China</li>
<li>Kobe, Japan</li>
<li>Yokohama, Japan</li>
<li>Hilo, Hawaii</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>‘Teach a Man: Wisdom’ T-Shirts</strong></p>
<p>When I designed this shirt, I wanted a purpose-oriented Tee that people would actually want to wear.  I started with a high quality Anvil Sustainable product that’s comfortably soft, cut in a flattering shape, and will stand up to years of wear.  Details include:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% Organic Cotton &amp; 50% Post-Consumer Recycled Polyester</li>
<li>Ultra smooth, lightweight Fabric</li>
<li>Pre-shrunk</li>
<li>Tear-away Neck Tag for Comfort</li>
<li>Available in Sizes S through 3XL</li>
<li>Note: Typically runs small (for sizing info visit: <a href=""http://www.customink.com/items/sizing/166200_lineup/standard.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.customink.com/items/sizing/166200_lineup/standard.htm</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens if we exceed $3800?</strong></p>
<p>Until the time meter runs out, we can continue to raise funds above and beyond the current goal.  Meaning, if you still want a ‘Wisdom Tee’ (or any other perk) or just care to support the cause, please go ahead and do so.  Here’s what I have in mind in case this happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jey gets several new sets of nice clothing for school.  There’s a reason you only see him in that lime green Tee (those pictures came from multiple days).  Attending the sociology lecture, I was blown away with how well students dress for class (polo’s, button-down shirts, skirts, dresses, and so on).  Compared to us casual Boulder students, our Ghanaian counterparts dress REALLY nicely.</li>
<li>Depending on housing costs, I’ll help Jey look into renting an apartment in Accra for when he’s on summer and winter break.  What I didn’t mention in the video is that Jey currently sleeps on a covered bench outside the Rising Phoenix Hotel.  He uses a tarp for a blanket and wears long-sleeve clothing to avoid mosquitoes and getting malaria during the night.  He very much lives hand-to-mouth...at least for now.</li>
<li>If the funds allow, I’d like to purchase a laptop for Jey.  Not necessarily a high-end or brand new model, just something that he can complete schoolwork on and send email to all of his supporters in the US.  He needs something that’ll last for at least three years.  And I know for a fact, this would be the first major possession he could call his own.</li>
<li>Other than that, you decide!  I’m certainly flexible in where additional support goes.  I’d love to hear any ideas you might have.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>FAQ’s</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You said you keep in touch with Jey through email.  Does he have a computer?
<ul>
<li>The first time I was asked this question, I had to ask Jey myself because I really didn’t know the answer.  No, he doesn’t have a computer.  Like many in Accra, Jey just doesn’t have the money to afford one.  Instead, he goes to public computer terminals and pays 80 peswes (about 41 cents) for each hour of use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you donate in other currencies besides USD?
<ul>
<li>Yes, absolutely!  Indiegogo will take payment in most currency forms, but your donation will need to be equivalent to the dollar amount of the perk you choose.  For instance, if you wish to recieve one of Jey's bracelets ($100), you'll need to donate something like 80 euros or 5,729 Indian Rupees.  Thanks to all our international sponsors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What percentage of T-shirt funds go to supporting Jey?
<ul>
<li>Each ‘Wisdom’ shirt sold generates right around $10 US for Jey’s education.  Unfortunately because of printing and shipping costs, I wasn’t able to negotiate a better margin without sacrificing product quality.  If you’re interested in helping Jey more (and still getting a Tee), I suggest looking at the other levels of contribution as they yield more to the ‘Teach a Man’ fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How are you getting Jey enrolled?
<ul>
<li>I’m currently in touch with Professor Kofi Adjei at the University of Ghana and despite his busy schedule, he’s offered to help in whatever ways he can to get Jey started.  So far, he’s given advice on how to pay the University and process that Jey must undergo to become enrolled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you have any other contacts in Ghana helping with this?
<ul>
<li>Yes, actually.  Not too long ago, I received an email from a Dutch volunteer, Jurriaan de Jong, who’s currently serving a 10-week stay in Ghana.  Jey put me in touch with Jurriaan in hopes that he could help me with this project.  We’ve emailed back and forth a few times and I’m thrilled to have someone actually in Ghana that can lend a hand if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where did you get all those photos in the video?
<ul>
<li>All but the T-Shirt pic came from my camera.  No Google Images on this one.  What you saw in the video is what my friends and I experienced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cheers &amp; Thank You</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of Jey, Jurriaan, Prof Adjei, and myself, I’d like to say thank you for your support.  It means the world to me that I have friends, family, and friends-of-friends to call on for something like this.  I know for a fact that it certainly means the world to Jey.  I believe we have the power to change the world every single day; we just need to start small.  For today, let’s teach a man...</p>

This is a campaign not just about dollars, but of building a fan base that will take this journey of basketball with me. For many players the goal of the NBA is the ultimate goal. For me, the goal is to continue to play, travel the world and incorporate my education into the ultimate goal of putting forth a positive image of the game to fans all over the world.</p>
<p>Since I graduated from college in 2010, I’ve continued to train and grow as a player. I got the chance to play in Europe last fall with an exhibition team and was selected for my first pro team as a rookie in the PBL. Immediately after the season, I continued my training and this summer I am attending camps so that I can try and secure a new team because my first team folded before the official season ended. I am utilizing my earnings for training, camps and travel already, but the more camps I attend and the more training I receive, the more chances I have to secure a team. Camps range from $175.00 to $500.00. I am attending several camps that have already been paid for. Also, while I pay for my gym membership myself, personal training is an additional expense. Finally, you need video of your games. As you know, putting your work on sites like YouTube and Vimeo is helping people from all walks of life to secure jobs and showcase their talents. You can spend up to $500.00 for a great highlight tape. I’m looking to offset those costs.</p>
<p>I am also looking for people to join “Team Mike Troll” and help me develop my fan base. There are perks for financial support but I hope that people who can’t support my campaign financially will still be a part of “Team Mike Troll” and help me spread the word about my journey!  I want fans of all ages to join me. I need you! If there are companies who are looking for a model for your sports branding, I’m your man! I have a background as a professional model. I am a member of SAG/AFTRA in good standing. I look forward to lending my talents to your vision! I’m looking forward to your support for this campaign and in the future. Thanks!  </p>

Immediately after the season, I continued my training and this summer I am attending camps so that I can try and secure a new team because my first team folded before the official season ended. I am utilizing my earnings for training, camps and travel already, but the more camps I attend and the more training I receive, the more chances I have to secure a team. Camps range from $175.00 to $500.00. I am attending several camps that have already been paid for. Also, while I pay for my gym membership myself, personal training is an additional expense. Finally, you need video of your games. As you know, putting your work on sites like YouTube and Vimeo is helping people from all walks of life to secure jobs and showcase their talents. You can spend up to $500.00 for a great highlight tape. I’m looking to offset those costs.
I am also looking for people to join “Team Mike Troll” and help me develop my fan base. There are perks for financial support but I hope that people who can’t support my campaign financially will still be a part of “Team Mike Troll” and help me spread the word about my journey!  I want fans of all ages to join me. I need you! If there are companies who are looking for a model for your sports branding, I’m your man! I have a background as a professional model. I am a member of SAG/AFTRA in good standing. I look forward to lending my talents to your vision! I’m looking forward to your support for this campaign and in the future. Thanks!  
Here are some links to show you where I’ve been in the process and where I plan to go! I hope you will join me! Check the box for email updates on the donation page!

<div>Hi!  My name is Rosiris Baez and I am passionate about inspiring others to reach their full potential despite their circumstances.  I, along with 3 friends, are working with Infusionarts in order to fund six Maasai children, so that they may go to school and have meals for a full year.  We are challenging ourselves to climb Mount Kilimanjaro because we want to raise awareness about how important it is for these children to have the opportunity to receive an education and a meal.  During our trip to Tanzania, we will be holding educational workshops for the children in the Maasai village.  We will be spending time with the children in order to experience their day to day struggles and really see what a gift an education will be, not only to them but to their families and the village as well.  </div>

<h2>Infusionarts</h2>
<p>Infusionarts is a UK based organization run by Shirley Beth Newbery.
Infusionarts works in both the UK and Africa. It runs community based arts
courses, workshops and film projects in the UK.  In Africa, Shirley
Beth raises money for micro projects, and individuals in need. Her small but
trusted network of contacts there ensures that her not-for-profit activities
make a significant difference for those she helps. </p>
<p>In 2009, for example, Infusionarts raised the $800 needed to pay for an operation for a Maasai lady
with a large goiter condition. The operation led to a full recovery and her
reintegration into her community. </p>
<p>Looking forward to 2014, Infusionarts is
raising money to fund schooling and meals for a year for six children in Northern Tanzania. Three at
primary level and three at secondary level. This will significantly enhance
the lives of those six children and their families, and increase their chances
of further education and a hopeful future. A future in which educated young
people in Africa see their developing countries grow stronger, becoming
self-sufficient and prosperous.</p>
<p>During our time there, we will be volunteering at the schools and supporting the children that we are affecting by holding workshops for them.  It is an amazing opportunity to be able to give the gift of education and we can't do it without you!</p>

<div>
<p>Many families live at a subsistence level

Western standards. The hope for the family's future seems to shine brighter
when their children are attending school. The children are keen to learn
and take pride in their place at a school. Your money will help these
children and their families by giving them hope for a brighter future. The children chosen will be attending school for the first time, others may need help to continue with
their education, with the hope of eventually going on to college or university
and a career.  This leads to them supporting their families and communities, so you are actually investing in the future of this Maasai Village!</p>
<p>Imagine having to tell your own children that they will have to stay at

We are proud members of the Hudson Area Library in Hudson, New York.  In about 12 months, we will be moving from our current facility to the Hudson Armory, more than doubling the Library's size.
This new facility is coming just
in time.  With studies indicating how
important early literacy is,  we're thrilled to have more room to dedicate to
the infants and young children in our membership area.  In
case you hadn't heard, it’s important to expose the youngest children to
reading.  Here’s what The New York Times said.With the increased recognition that an important part of brain development occurs within the first three years of a child's life, and reading to children enhances vocabulary and other important communication skills, the group, which represents 62,000 pediatricians across the country, is asking its members to become powerful advocates for reading aloud, every time a baby visits a doctor.""It should be there each time we touch bases with children,"" said Dr.  Pamela High, who wrote new policy.  It recommends that doctors tell parents they should be ""reading together as a daily fun family activity"" from infancy.  (Pediatrics Group to Recommend Reading Aloud to Children from Birth - June 24, 2014 - New York Times)


An important part of brain development occurs within the first three years of a child's life, and reading to children enhances vocabulary and other critical communications skills. What We NeedWe are very close to our goal raise $5,000 to support our Early Literacy Storytime
Nook, part of our Children’s Library area.  Your contribution will go towards furnishings in the nook - a place where our staff will hold story times for infants and preschoolers as well as a place where parents and children can read together.  Comfy chairs in both grown-up and pint-size will make the nook inviting - a perfect environment to absorb the basics of learning.  With your help, we hope to create an inviting space and bring more and more children and families into our new, expanded Hudson Area Library. The more readers, the better!The nook is housed in the round
turret of the Hudson Armory shown in this vintage rendering. It's a perfect place for imaginations to grow.The ImpactEarly Literacy has been proven to have an impact on children

<h3>What is a Cavalcade of Authors?</h3>
<p><span>Cavalcade of Authors is a conference for students made up of two components: 1) students reading novels from 17 featured authors, and 2) a writer's conference led by these authors to be held on May 2nd, 2015. We are collaborating with Pacific Lutheran University to present a literary/writing conference for 450 middle level and high school students in Pierce County, Washington. COA West is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Cavalcade of Authors West is in its first year, modeled after the Cavalcade of Authors established in the Tri Cities of Washington in 2009.  We want to bring the rich experience of working with authors practically one-on-one to western Washington students.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Adolescent literacy is a significant need in our community and this program promotes reading and writing skills in an engaging and unique way. The response from students, teachers, and authors has been positive and encouraging. It is our hope that the program will grow and expand to become a truly regional event that draws students from all around Pierce County.</p>
<p>Our five <a href=""http://cavalcadeofauthorswest.wordpress.com/contact-us/cavalcade-of-authors-west-board-members/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">founding board members</a> have a vast amount of teaching and literacy experience as classroom teachers and librarians. We have each contributed to a number of boards, conferences and events of various sizes and scope. Above all, we all have a passion for students, authors and literacy; this conference will allow us to combine all of those pieces to deliver a unique and meaningful experience to the students of our own community.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To operate a program of this magnitude for our Pierce County students, we are looking to raise nearly $18,000. To reach as many students and schools as possible, donations of any value are welcome and appreciated. </p>
<p>The funds will go directly to pay author honorariums, travel and lodging expenses, and meals, as well as for marketing and school outreach. We have worked hard to negotiate discounts and donations when possible; for instance, conference fees have been donated by PLU and many authors are donating travel expenses and autographed books. </p>
<p><b>Perks:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$500 - Author Social invitation May 1, 2015</li>
<li>$100 - Autographed book by the author of your choice</li>
<li>$25 - Poster autographed by all participating authors</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are committed to promoting literacy in our community. We want to pass on the love for books in our world that is slowly beginning to devalue the wonder of reading. As educators, we know that reading is the number one indicator of student success in school and in determining their earning power in the workplace. The Cavalcade of Authors West is the experience of a lifetime for students, bringing together world-class authors and their young adult readers.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This is the first event of its kind in the Puget Sound. Although it is our first year, we are using the very successful Cavalcade of Authors (Tri-Cities) as our template, and with their support, we are confident in the success of this project. We are also well aware of national and regional book and author festivals, have attended a number ourselves, and we understand the amount of work, planning and support that must go into them to make these events successful, and ripe for growth year after year. We have 17 authors contracted at this time, both local and nationally known, and know we can continue to attract the high caliber authors that are at the top of students' reading lists. Our biggest challenge is having the money to support our commitments to both authors and students. We will continue to reach out to our corporate community as partners in this project, but we need to count on our friends and supporters to get off the ground.</p>

I am fortunate enough to qualify for a generous financial aid package that allows me to attend this school which I would otherwise have no way of affording.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I graduated from high school in 2003, and while I went to a local community college right away with the intent of transferring to San Jose State University, life decided to intervene. Because of the stress related to my father's long term illness (which he would later pass away as a result of), I left school and started working full time. Fate has a funny way of working things out, and I met my husband at my first full time job. We have moved around quite a bit, but we have been working towards the goal of earning our Bachelor's degrees. We're taking turns so that one of us is working full time to pay the bills while the other goes to school, and I'm going first.</p>
<p><b>This means that not only will you be helping me to finish school, you'll be enabling my husband to start going back to school as well.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>""But Christy,"" you probably aren't saying, ""Your Senior Year should be so much more than just graduation. College should be an experience!"" You're right, Imaginary You. It should be! So if I am able to reach my goal and achieve certain amounts beyond my goal, I will be able to do more than just graduate - I will be able to do two things that I would love to do in the next year!</p>
<p>And if you want to see me suffer? Well, there are even benefits for you. The more people who donate, the closer I get to perils and pitfalls. There's fun available for everyone!</p>
<p><b>Stretch Goals:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$3,500: </strong><strong>I start learning to play hockey, and YOU reap the benefits.</strong>How is that? I will document by video my journey from out-of-shape, terribad skater who can't stop (me right now) to...maybe slightly less terribad? These videos will then be posted to YouTube for the entire world to admire/be inspired by/laugh at. I guarantee that even if I fail utterly, you'll still have a good time. There will be a minimum of one video per week throughout my journey. This goal amount is based on a rough estimate of what I would need to purchase the needed equipment, lessons and ice time to start playing.</li>
<li>
<b>$5,000: Outdoor Game and Bay Area Meetup! </b>In February, the San Jose Sharks will be playing the Los Angeles Kings in the brand new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. Outside. In California. Because reasons. If I make this much, my husband and I will be able to afford a trip back to the Bay Area to go to this game. And, once there, I'd love to have a few beers with any of you there, with a drink (or more than just one? depends) on me.</li>
<li>
<strong>$7,000: Make me learn to play goalie. </strong>I'm not tall and I'm stocky, and would probably make a terrible goalie. I guess my flexibility is not terrible considering how out of shape I am? But still, it'd be hilariously bad. Increase the hilarity of the previous reward by making me look like a fish out of water. This goal amount is based on a rough estimate of what I would need to purchase the significantly more expensive goalie equipment, as well as the cost to my dignity and ligaments.</li>
<li>
<strong>$10,000: I will buy and wear a Kings jersey.</strong> Seriously. I'll do it. I'll do a video wearing it. This will probably make me cry. Extra hilarity. This goal amount is based on a rough estimate of how much money I would need to be OK with this. Emotional damages will result. It will haunt me. But hey, it will make you laugh, and it's not like we're going to hit that amount, right?</li>
</ul>
<p></p> 
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As a Dean's List student determined to graduate, it would take an event of life-altering proportions to keep me from graduating this year. Even if something awful were to happen to me or my family, you can bet I'd do everything in my power to finish school now that I'm this close.

</div></div>","Help Me Finish the Job!
Hi! My name is Christy. You may know me better from the internet as /u/sadaye or @HockeyBabbler. I am a nontraditional student in her final year at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA. It's been a journey to get to this point, and it hasn't been easy. I am fortunate enough to qualify for a generous financial aid package that allows me to attend this school which I would otherwise have no way of affording. However, with a recent rise in tuition prices by nearly $1,000 a semester, I've gone from receiving $500 per semester to spend on books and other expenses to owing $435 each semester just for tuition. That's not counting the $200-$300 worth of books I am required to get for each semester. While I have a job on campus and my husband works full-time, we are already living paycheck to paycheck, sharing a house with a roommate and living frugally. It may not sound like a lot of money to you, but the difference of $935 a semester moves us from ""ok but poor"" to ""one small problem from real trouble.""

By donating, you will be helping me to finally receive my Bachelor's degree and bring me one step closer to my dream of working in publishing. $1,400 will pay for my books and tuition for the rest of the year.

What I Need & What You Get
 Breakdown of expenses:


$665.72 - Fall 2014: $435 Tuition (after Financial Aid), $232.72 for Books.


$685 - Spring 2015: $435 Tuition (after Financial Aid), ~$250 for Books (exact cost currently unknown)

~$50: Approximate fees should I reach my goal
Total: ~$1400.72. We'll call it $1400.


Rewards
(See individual rewards for details and restrictions)



  
The Impact I graduated from high school in 2003, and while I went to a local community college right away with the intent of transferring to San Jose State University, life decided to intervene. Because of the stress related to my father's long term illness (which he would later pass away as a result of), I left school and started working full time. Fate has a funny way of working things out, and I met my husband at my first full time job. We have moved around quite a bit, but we have been working towards the goal of earning our Bachelor's degrees. We're taking turns so that one of us is working full time to pay the bills while the other goes to school, and I'm going first.
This means that not only will you be helping me to finish school, you'll be enabling my husband to start going back to school as well.


""But Christy,"" you probably aren't saying, ""Your Senior Year should be so much more than just graduation. College should be an experience!"" You're right, Imaginary You. It should be! So if I am able to reach my goal and achieve certain amounts beyond my goal, I will be able to do more than just graduate - I will be able to do two things that I would love to do in the next year!
And if you want to see me suffer? Well, there are even benefits for you. The more people who donate, the closer I get to perils and pitfalls. There's fun available for everyone!
Stretch Goals:


$3,500: I start learning to play hockey, and YOU reap the benefits.How is that? I will document by video my journey from out-of-shape, terribad skater who can't stop (me right now) to...maybe slightly less terribad? These videos will then be posted to YouTube for the entire world to admire/be inspired by/laugh at. I guarantee that even if I fail utterly, you'll still have a good time. There will be a minimum of one video per week throughout my journey. This goal amount is based on a rough estimate of what I would need to purchase the needed equipment, lessons and ice time to start playing.

$5,000: Outdoor Game and Bay Area Meetup! In February, the San Jose Sharks will be playing the Los Angeles Kings in the brand new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. Outside. In California. Because reasons. If I make this much, my husband and I will be able to afford a trip back to the Bay Area to go to this game. And, once there, I'd love to have a few beers with any of you there, with a drink (or more than just one? depends) on me.

$7,000: Make me learn to play goalie. I'm not tall and I'm stocky, and would probably make a terrible goalie. I guess my flexibility is not terrible considering how out of shape I am? But still, it'd be hilariously bad. Increase the hilarity of the previous reward by making me look like a fish out of water. This goal amount is based on a rough estimate of what I would need to purchase the significantly more expensive goalie equipment, as well as the cost to my dignity and ligaments.

$10,000: I will buy and wear a Kings jersey. Seriously. I'll do it. I'll do a video wearing it. This will probably make me cry. Extra hilarity. This goal amount is based on a rough estimate of how much money I would need to be OK with this. Emotional damages will result. It will haunt me. But hey, it will make you laugh, and it's not like we're going to hit that amount, right?

 
  Risks & Challenges As a Dean's List student determined to graduate, it would take an event of life-altering proportions to keep me from graduating this year. Even if something awful were to happen to me or my family, you can bet I'd do everything in my power to finish school now that I'm this close. I can't make any promises about the quality of the hockey if I get that far in my funding, though.
Aside from the risk of being able to fulfill that which I say I will fulfill by raising this money, there is also the risk that I will not be able to deliver the rewards promised. I will combat this by starting on the custom doodles as soon as the first donations roll in - that's right, before I'm even guaranteed funding, you'll be getting rewards. If I don't reach my goal, not only will you get your money back, but you'll get to keep your doodle. How awesome is that?

<p>Of course, I would be extremely thankful for any further donations

<p><strong><em>With funds reaching $1,900</em></strong></p>
<p>If I am fortunate enough to reach $1,900, I will spend two out of my

Together, the 5 weeks would cost $840 extra than attending just the 
normal course for the 5 weeks.</p>
<p><em>Benefit:</em> In the two weeks in the “Intensive Special Course” I
 get 20 hours of private tutoring from teachers from the school for 
extra support in class materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>With funds reaching $2,200</em></strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much! Now I’ll be able to spend 6 weeks in the Neue

30 weeks of private tutoring and 3 weeks in the normal intensive course.</p>
<p><strong>What if my financial goal isn’t met?</strong></p>
<p>Even if my goal of $1,200 isn’t reached, I still can use the

Of course, I would be extremely thankful for any further donations 
after my goal and will dedicate them to working even harder to passing 
the C2 exam. There are many ways for me to do that in accredited 
language schools, depending on available funds. I 
will gladly provide proof of how I allocate all funds.
With funds reaching $1,900
If I am fortunate enough to reach $1,900, I will spend two out of my
 five weeks at the Neue Schule language school in the “Intensive Special
 Course” and the other three weeks in the normal intensive course. 
Together, the 5 weeks would cost $840 extra than attending just the 
normal course for the 5 weeks.
Benefit: In the two weeks in the “Intensive Special Course” I
 get 20 hours of private tutoring from teachers from the school for 
extra support in class materials.
With funds reaching $2,200
Thank you so much! Now I’ll be able to spend 6 weeks in the Neue 
Schule language school: 3 weeks in the “Intensive Special Course” with 
30 weeks of private tutoring and 3 weeks in the normal intensive course.
What if my financial goal isn’t met?
Even if my goal of $1,200 isn’t reached, I still can use the 
donations made to take the exam ($370). Any further funding will be used
 to spend as much time in preparatory courses as possible.

</h1>We are proud of our history of providing individuals and families with the tools they need to thrive; such as educational, recreational and social service programs.  We are proud of our successes and our growth, but with current economic challenges and wavering government support, we know that we need to do more. <br/><br/><b>We have two great needs and opportunities to respond to the communities we serve: </b><br/><br/><blockquote>The first is the need to support our <b>Early Childhood Education Program</b>. Educators agree that the first few years of a child’s life are a particularly sensitive period in their development. Our programs are critical to helping children develop cognitive, social and behavioral functions, as well as language development. We even address nutrition and the physical health of the child at this critical point of development. Our program does so much more than prepare children for success in school; it provides support for the parents, the children, and in many ways, the family as a whole and lays the foundation for a lifetime of learning and success. All the children we serve are at-risk for academic failure, and 100% of our students enter Kindergarten ready and able to learn.<br/><br/>The second is our <b>Adult Education Program</b> through which we offer English As a Second Language (ESL) and basic computer classes. Our ESL classes transform immigrants into confident and able citizens through reading, writing, listening, speaking and grammar instruction.  Beyond teaching non-native speakers verbal and comprehensive skills, we are empowering entire families by helping them acclimate to their new communities and culture. <br/>
</blockquote><br/><h2 style=""font-size: 2em; color: #0a658c; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.1em;"">Better Education = Better Opportunities<br/>
</h2>Studies by the Department of Education suggest that non-English speaking adults were at a distinct disadvantage regardless of education level and were routinely placed in entry-level positions or non-critical jobs. However, after ESL classes, participants were eligible for jobs that included rigorous training and accordingly higher pay with better opportunities for advancement. Through our programs we not only hope to increase the ability to expand employment opportunities, but also to help individuals and families thrive by integrating into their surrounding communities. By expanding our ESL offering, we are hoping to elevate the opportunity and potential of all participants.<br/><br/>Our Community Computer Resource Center (CCRC) provides classes in essential computer skills.  As the only free, open access computer lab in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood, individuals have the opportunity to learn computers to compete in today’s job market. Our courses include beginner-level to advanced technology with a focus on topics like Microsoft Office software, job search tools, web site design, and introduction to hardware.

<h3>About the School</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>CCP is a private
school that offers classes from pre-school through ninth
grade.<span>  It was founded in 1997 by the
Mission of the Presbyterian Church of South Korea in Nicaragua in order to
provide a better education, opportunity, and moral guidance for the children of
Barrio Hialeah.  The Korean mission
continues to operate the school.  CCP
provides a much higher quality of education than is provided in the public schools, which is evidenced by the fact that over 250 families in this extremely poor
neighborhood make the sacrifice to pay the tuition fee.  </span></p>

</p><p><b>UGANDA</b>:
Only 32% of children in Uganda have the opportunity to complete primary education. Until 2006, devastating
political conflict and rebellion beleaguered northern Ugandan children for over
two decades, leaving this region of the world underdeveloped and virtually
forgotten. Health-related issues such as female menstruation and
sexual/reproductive health still remain taboo to discuss in the Ugandan
culture, and consequently are not taught in schools, leaving youth with very
little knowledge about their bodies and rights. </p>
<p><b>THE GIRLS</b>:
The girls’ ability to achieve their full potential is limited by this lack of
knowledge coupled with major health and inequality concerns, including domestic
abuse, gender-based violence, dropping out of school due to lack of funding or
household responsibilities, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases (STD's),
early marriage, and unwanted pregnancy. </p>
<p>Schools often do not have the proper
accommodations, including: appropriate bathrooms, feminine products, adequate
sanitation, or even a place to dispose of used feminine products. Millions of
girls in developing countries like Uganda miss up to 20% of the school
year because they cannot afford mainstream sanitary products when they
menstruate or because their schools lack proper facilities. Therefore, a girl’s
right to an education can be dramatically curtailed when schools lack these
necessary tools.</p>
<p><b>US</b><b>: </b>Educate for Change (E4C) is a 501c3 non-profit
organization founded by two change-seeking American women and one Ugandan woman, determined to change educational
opportunities in Uganda after teaching in the Ugandan school system and
observing the steep educational inequalities.</p>
<p>E4C was founded to
empower the most vulnerable children in northern Uganda by providing
high-performing primary male and female students with scholarships to secondary
school. Since it’s inception in 2012, we have managed to make a secondary
education possible for over 40 students. Our scholarship program aims
at keeping these high-achieving students in the school system even if their
families cannot afford further schooling.  Check out our website today at <a href=""http://www.educateforchange.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.educateforchange.us</a>. <br/></p>
<p><b>OUR PROJECT</b>: This summer E4C will host recurring multi-day Health and Leadership
Camps to provide imperative education to female youth on topics including
feminine health, sexual health, self-defense, and self-esteem. But we need your
help!  In order to best prepare, we have a pilot project scheduled for April 24-26th with our Educate for Change female scholarship beneficiaries.  <b>In order to make this three day, boarding camp work, we need $1,500 </b>(tax deductible)<b>.  </b> </p>
<p>In July and August
2015, Health and Leadership camps will be held in several sessions for students
from various villages. Taking place throughout rural northern Uganda, each camp
will provide approximately 100 at-risk girls with critical information on
topics including feminine health (menstruation, HIV/AIDS and STD's, pregnancy),
gender issues (domestic abuse, gender-based violence), self-defense, and
self-esteem. </p>
<p>By providing a comfortable and culturally
sensitive atmosphere, girls will become educated, empowered, and able to make
smart decisions that benefit their general and sexual health for the rest of
their lives. Attendees will receive reusable feminine products, providing
approximately <b>400 girls</b> with a

<p>The learning and passing on of knowledge will
be a <i>boundless</i> cycle of change after

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a teacher of information technology and computer in a country school in Batman. I pioneer to this campaign for my students who have not touched to real computers more than seeing on TV. In March, 2015, we moved to our new school consisting of 32 classrooms. we have more than 1000 students. As long as visual and auditory teaching materials are used, learning occurs faster and more permanently. Therefore we are trying to provide our students with more productive learning environment. In order to reach our purpose we request your donations for our school. Thank you for everything in advance.</p>

</div></div>","Merhaba
Ben Batman’ın merkez köyüne bağlı Aydınkonak Ortaokulu’nda görev yapan Bilişim Teknolojileri ve Yazılım öğretmeniyim. Okulum, daha doğrusu öğrencilerim için bu kampanyayı başlatmak istedim.
 

Okulumuz tek blok, 32 derslikten oluşan, 2015 Mart ayında teslim aldığımız bir yeni bir okul. Okulumuzun öğrenci sayısı 1000’i geçmektedir.  Dersliklerin ise -öğretmen ihtiyacından dolayı- sadece 14 tanesi kullanımdadır.  Ortalama sınıf mevcudu 40-45 öğrenciden oluşmaktadır. Okulumuzdaki öğretmen arkadaşlarımızla birlikte bu yeni eğitim kurumunun ihtiyaçlarını karşılamak adına oldukça emek veriyoruz.
 
 2013 yılında Bilişim Teknolojileri ve Yazılım dersi yaratıcı- eleştirel -analitik-üç boyutlu düşünebilme, neden sonuç ilişkilerini kurabilme, özgüven geliştirme, girişimcilik gibi kazanımlarla 5. ve 6. Sınıflara haftada 2 saat olmak üzere zorunlu ders,  7. ve 8. Sınıflarda ise hafta iki saat seçmeli ders haline getirilmiştir. Fakat uygulamaya konulan bu ders gerek laboratuvar gerekse donanım altyapısı sağlanmadan uygulamaya konulduğu amacına hizmet edemiyor.
 
 Yapılandırmacı eğitim anlayışına göre yaparak/yaşayarak öğrenmenin gerçekleşmesi gereken bu uygulama dersi, okulumuzda teoriden pratiğe geçememektedir.  Milli Eğitim Bakanlığına gerekli donanımların sağlanması için yapılan başvurularımız olumsuz sonuçlanmış, Fatih Projesi’nin beklenilmesi yönünde dönüşler alınmıştır. 
İnsanlar okuduklarının % 10’unu, işittiklerinin % 20’sini, hem görüp hem de işittiklerinin% 50’sini, söylediklerinin % 70’ini ve yapıp söyledikleri bir şeyin ise % 90’ını hatırlar. Öğretimde görsel ve işitsel araçlar kullanıldığında öğrenme hem daha çabuk ve hem de daha kalıcı olduğundan biz de öğrencilerimize daha sağlıklı bir eğitim verebilmek için bu ortamı sağlamalıyız. Bu bağlamda okulumuzun bilgisayar ihtiyacının karşılanması için yardım talep etmekteyiz.
Şimdiden her şey için teşekkür ederim.

<h3>Belgrade VIP in a nutshell</h3>
<p><i>What shall we do this weekend? </i>It's a question all of us ask. Maybe we'll take in a basketball game or attend a tennis match. Maybe we'll go hiking or visit a museum. Are there any good movies at the cinema? Who's playing at local nightclubs? Is there a ballet performance this week?</p>
<p>For 20,000 English  expatriates, executives, and embassy employees here in Belgrade, making plans is no simple matter. This European capital is quickly becoming a tourism hotspot but there is no English-language resource that lists options.</p>
<p>What exhibits are opening at the capital's museums? Where can I find a gym with a swimming pool? What exhibitions are coming to the Belgrade Sajam, the expo center? What family and children's events are coming to town? How long will the carnival be here before it moves on? What international entertainers are coming to play at the Kalemegdan and the Sava Centar? Where can I sign up for a tour of Belgrade's wine country or its historic pre-Roman settlements? What are some good destinations for weekend getaways? Where do I find local mineral hot springs and spas?</p>
<p>I'm J.D. Hildebrand. I've been producing information products - magazines, blogs, brochures, whitepapers, websites - since 1983. I've lived in Serbia for the past five years and I have heard dozens of expats lament the difficulty of exploring this part of the world and taking advantage of all it has to offer.</p>
<p>That's why I am looking to launch the Belgrade VIP program:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives English-speaking residents and visitors convenient access to information they need.</li>
<li>It gives Serbian businesses cost-effective access to an audience elite, affluent customers.</li>
<li>It allows me to support my family doing the work I love doing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How to get involved</h3>
<p>The Belgrade VIP program isn't going to make anyone rich, but it should provide a good living for three staff members and generate enough profits for us to make contributions to charity a couple times a year. We'll be directing at least part of our charitable giving to the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation. You can help us choose where to send the rest.</p>
<p>I forecast break-even well before the end of year one. We're looking for operating expenses as we ramp up to 100 percent revenue. We expect 10,000 euros will cover cash-flow needs during that period, though we would be glad to raise a bit more.</p>
<p>That amount will cover start-up costs, including legal and accounting consultations. We won't be renting an office or purchasing computers. Workers will be self-employed under Serbia's ""agency"" tax designation. The main cost is salaries during the first three or four months of operation as revenues ramp up.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I have surveyed the English-speaking community here to assess their interest in an information product like this. There is high demand for information about local events, about Serbian culture and history, and about nearby travel destinations. This is also a unique, cost-effective opportunity for local businesses to reach out to the small but affluent English-speaking expat community.</p>
<p>With Belgrade VIP we'll send a weekly newsletter of current events to everyone who visits our website and subscribes. The newsletter will also include an updated list of discounts and special programs currently offered to our elite members - so every issue we send out will also be a marketing piece.</p>
<p>In addition to listings, we can expand the website to include reviews and blog posts from expats who are exploring the Balkans.</p>
<p>I have worked closely with the English-speaking expat community. A couple years ago I teamed up with the Belgrade Foreign Visitors Club to launch Stranac Academy, a night school for English-speaking adults. BFVC has promised to cooperate with the Belgrade VIP program, including marketing the program on its Facebook page and website, access to its email list, and more. </p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>The idea of a paid-membership discount program is proven in America but not among expats. It may be that we need to adjust our program to emphasize unique members-only events, not discounts. It may be that our 79-euro annual price is too high or that we are unable to convince Serbian businesses to offer discounts to our members.</p>
<p>An enterprise of this size is highly dependent on the personnel. I'm confident that I can use WordPress, themes, plug-ins, and Mailchimp to set up the program and that I can write all the copy. But if the project were to lose my involvement, I would be tough to replace.</p>
<p>We will be similarly dependent on our sales manager, who will reach out to Serbian language schools, restaurants, splavs, kafanas, and other businesses to offer discounts to members. Hiring the wrong sales manager, or losing a competent one unexpectedly, could damage our prospects.</p>
<h3>Growth opportunities</h3>
<p>Once the website and membership program are off the ground, we can expand the business with events. Once or twice a month we can have breakfast programs featuring presentations from experts in Serbian culture and history, Serbian tax law and real estate regulations, business law, Serbian holiday traditions, and more. </p>
<p>The website and membership program serve as a platform for the breakfast programs and other ancillary businesses. They establish a relationship of authority and trust between us and the expat community. That relationship allows us to pursue further business opportunities that are much more profitable than the ""main"" project.</p>
<h3>Thank you very much!</h3>

<p><span><b>A Message From Our Team</b></span></p>
<p>Operation Refugee Child will help aid those who have left everything behind and have little or nothing to eat or keep themselves warm. As parents, we work hard to keep our children warm, healthy and safe, and it is our intention to keep helping these families and children who need us the most. The Syrian Refugee crisis really hit home, as many of us have children the same age as sweet little Aylan Kurdi, whose body washed ashore after attempting to reach Europe with his family.</p>
<p>We are a volunteer group of over 5,000 people who have united together from across the globe with one common goal of aiding refugees families. Over 9,000 refugees are arriving daily in Greece and 30% of them are children (UNHCR). Facing torrential rains and the onset of winter, refugee families urgently need food to eat and clothing and supplies to stay warm, clean, and healthy as they continue on their journey across Europe. </p>
<p>However, there is little to no support on the ground for refugees; local governments are underfunded and overwhelmed, and large aid organizations have a surprisingly minimal presence.</p>
<p>As parents, we want the best for our children, and we make these decisions based first on safety. You wouldn’t put your family in a tiny boat to cross the sea unless you knew it was safer than land. If and when these families survive the boat ride across the Aegean Sea, they face hardships on land with no food, shelter or warm clothes. We want to aid these families with items that can help ease their transition on their journey to asylum. Refugees are sleeping in the parks without shelter, water, food, bathrooms, medicine, or dry clothes.</p>
<b>Operation Refugee Child</b> will provide refugee families with supplies for a healthier and safer journey to their asylum destination through direct volunteer distribution of donations. All it takes is one person to start changing the world, and it can start with you! We look forward to delivering your Operation Refugee Child Relief Pack to a refugee family soon! <br/>
<p>Our volunteers work as a team to provide refugee families with essential items* that they will need on their long journey.  ORC backpacks will include items such as: Mylar
blankets, Thermal sleeping bag (heavy duty), Battery-less flashlights, Adult
poncho, Inflatable pillow, Kid poncho, Emergency whistle, 1st aid kits 54 piece,
Hand warmers, Rehydration salts, Balloons, Fleece hat, Mittens, Toothbrush/toothpaste,
Baby socks, Chapstick, Plush toys, Sharpie marker, Purell, ID Lanyards, Collapsible
water bottles, Caribiner 25 lb, 4 pack crayons, Drawing pad, Baby food, Protein
bars, Halal beef jerky, Diaper rash cream, Candy, Pacifiers, Warm baby blankets,
Wool headscarf, Vaseline, Chamois towels, Tea Tree Oil, Baby bottles &amp;
Nipples, Ready to use formula.</p>

The Syrian Refugee crisis really hit home, as many of us have children the same age as sweet little Aylan Kurdi, whose body washed ashore after attempting to reach Europe with his family.
We are a volunteer group of over 5,000 people who have united together from across the globe with one common goal of aiding refugees families. Over 9,000 refugees are arriving daily in Greece and 30% of them are children (UNHCR). Facing torrential rains and the onset of winter, refugee families urgently need food to eat and clothing and supplies to stay warm, clean, and healthy as they continue on their journey across Europe. 
However, there is little to no support on the ground for refugees; local governments are underfunded and overwhelmed, and large aid organizations have a surprisingly minimal presence.
As parents, we want the best for our children, and we make these decisions based first on safety. You wouldn’t put your family in a tiny boat to cross the sea unless you knew it was safer than land. If and when these families survive the boat ride across the Aegean Sea, they face hardships on land with no food, shelter or warm clothes. We want to aid these families with items that can help ease their transition on their journey to asylum. Refugees are sleeping in the parks without shelter, water, food, bathrooms, medicine, or dry clothes.
Operation Refugee Child will provide refugee families with supplies for a healthier and safer journey to their asylum destination through direct volunteer distribution of donations. All it takes is one person to start changing the world, and it can start with you! We look forward to delivering your Operation Refugee Child Relief Pack to a refugee family soon! 
Our volunteers work as a team to provide refugee families with essential items* that they will need on their long journey.  ORC backpacks will include items such as: Mylar
blankets, Thermal sleeping bag (heavy duty), Battery-less flashlights, Adult
poncho, Inflatable pillow, Kid poncho, Emergency whistle, 1st aid kits 54 piece,
Hand warmers, Rehydration salts, Balloons, Fleece hat, Mittens, Toothbrush/toothpaste,
Baby socks, Chapstick, Plush toys, Sharpie marker, Purell, ID Lanyards, Collapsible
water bottles, Caribiner 25 lb, 4 pack crayons, Drawing pad, Baby food, Protein
bars, Halal beef jerky, Diaper rash cream, Candy, Pacifiers, Warm baby blankets,
Wool headscarf, Vaseline, Chamois towels, Tea Tree Oil, Baby bottles &
Nipples, Ready to use formula.

<h3>A propos de moi</h3>
<p>Je m'appelle Jeanne et je viens de terminer ma dernière année de Licence Etudes Cinématographiques et Audiovisuelles à L'Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée. Pour cette dernière année, je suis partie en tant qu'étudiante d'échange aux Etats-Unis, en Californie. Durant deux semestres, j'ai pu apprendre aux côtés de professeurs renommés comme John Wineglass (Compositeur et Lauréat de trois Emmy Awards entre 2001 et 2005) et nouer des relations extraordinaires avec des étudiants de nombreux pays. Aussi ai-je décidé de repartir pour un an, cette fois sans support financier de la part de mon Université.</p>
<p>Effectuer une année supplémentaire à l'Université de Monterey Bay me permettrait de réaliser un court métrage de niveau professionnel avec toute une équipe d'étudiants passionnés. Je pourrais mettre en commun toutes les connaissances acquises pendant ma Licence pour créer un projet qui me tient à coeur et que je pourrais présenter à des festivals.</p>

<h3>A quoi sert cette somme ?</h3>
<p>10600$ est la somme requise pour l'inscription à la California State University Monterey Bay. En effet, en raison de 5300$ par semestre pour les étudiants étrangers, une année en Californie coûte cher.</p>
<p>C'est donc pour cela que j'ai besoin de votre aide ! Bien sûr, toute participation compte. Ainsi, même une petite somme peut m'aider à réaliser mon rêve. Mes parents prennent en charge mon loyer, l'argent recueilli me servira à payer mon inscription uniquement. Si le projet recueille plus d'argent que prévu, celui ci me servirait à:</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>Hi All - this campaign is still open and we're hoping to reach the</p>
<h2>STRETCH GOAL: $50,000. </h2>
<p>Thank you everyone for your support! We appreciate this very much.</p>
<div>_________________________________________________________________________</div>
<div> </div>
<p><b>EINSTEIN</b> spent the last 30 years of his life searching for an answer to the deepest question about the universe: does a fundamental principle, that governs all of reality, exist? He was searching for a unified field theory but he did not succeed.</p>
<p>In 2013 we, the theoretical physicist Jesper Møller Grimstrup and the mathematician Johannes Aastrup, discovered a simple mathematical principle, which we believe could be exactly what Einstein was searching for.</p>
<p>In a recent series of <a href=""https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&amp;ln=en&amp;p=find+a+grimstrup+and+date+%3E+2011+and+not++arXiv%3A1203.6164&amp;of=hb&amp;action_search=Search&amp;sf=earliestdate&amp;so=d&amp;rm=&amp;rg=25&amp;sc=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>publications</span></a>* we have shown that this principle, which we found after 10 years of research, entails a rich mathematical theory - we call it <b>QUANTUM HOLONOMY THEORY </b>- that shows signs of being a unified theory of quantum gravity. If our hypothesis is true it will revolutionize not only physics but science in general and beyond.</p>
<p>The purpose of this crowdfunding campaign is to secure the funding needed to further analyze this mathematical principle and the theory it entails and to determine if this really is a 'theory of everything'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461834958/IMG_0199_sv184i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>THE PRINCIPLE</b></h3>
<p>The principle, which we discovered, is an algebra that essentially encodes how objects are moved in an abstract space. </p>
<p>This elementary algebra simultaneously includes the fundamental premise of a quantum theory of gravity and a mathematical mechanism known to be related to a unification of the fundamental forces. This means that this algebra includes key elements of a unified theory of quantum gravity - the holy grail of modern physics.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this algebra has never been studied before.</p>
<p>We found this algebra after many years of analysis, where we applied methods of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>modern mathematics</span></a> to the questions of how to quantize Einsteins theory of general relativity and how to unify the four fundamental forces of Nature.</p>
<p>The reconciliation of quantum mechanics with Einsteins theory of relativity is the most important unsolved problem in modern theoretical physics and is believed to hold the key to some of the deepest mysteries about the universe and its origin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Why is this algebra remarkable?</b></p>
<p>There are three features, which makes this algebra exceedingly interesting to study:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is so elementary, that it seems immune to further reductions in the sense of being explained by other, deeper mathematical principles.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It gives rise to a rich mathematical structure, that links together several modern research programs in theoretical physics and mathematics.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is so utterly natural.</span></li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461835028/IMG_0203_kvr823.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>THE THEORY</b></h3>
<p>Our analysis so far shows that this algebra generates a complex mathematical theory, which we call<a href=""https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&amp;ln=en&amp;p=find+a+grimstrup+and+date+%3E+2011+and+not++arXiv%3A1203.6164&amp;of=hb&amp;action_search=Search&amp;sf=earliestdate&amp;so=d&amp;rm=&amp;rg=25&amp;sc=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> quantum holonomy theory</a>. This theory has a number of remarkable features:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It includes matter with the correct coupling to gravity.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It produces a key mathematical mechanism that is known to be related to gauge degrees of freedom, i.e. <i>fundamental forces</i>.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It shows promising signs of being internally consistent.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These achievements are very non-trivial and make quantum holonomy theory an exciting candidate for a unified theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Our results are either published in top international journals such as <i>Communications in Mathematical Physics</i> and <i>Classical and Quantum Gravity</i><b> </b>or presently in the peer review process. For more information on quantum holonomy theory please check out this <a href=""http://jespergrimstrup.org/quantum-holonomy-theory/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>homepage</span></a> or <a href=""https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&amp;ln=en&amp;p=find+a+grimstrup+and+date+%3E+2011+and+not++arXiv%3A1203.6164&amp;of=hb&amp;action_search=Search&amp;sf=earliestdate&amp;so=d&amp;rm=&amp;rg=25&amp;sc=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">these papers</a>*.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><b>THE GOAL</b></h3>
<p>There are two natural milestones for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A consistent theory. </b>A mathematical proof that quantum holonomy theory is internally consistent. In physics-lingo this means proving that the constraint algebra closes off-shell.</li>
<li>
<b>Proof of unification. </b>Unambiguous proof that quantum holonomy theory is a theory of unification of the fundamental forces. In physics-lingo this means a clear connection to the <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0608226.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>non-commutative formulation of the Standard Model of Particle Physics</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If just one of these goals are met it will be clear that quantum holonomy theory is one of the most promising candidate for a final theory that is known today. </p>
<p>The goal of this crowdfunding campaign is <i>to meet at least one of these milestones. </i>We believe that this is possible within five years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461835235/IMG_0205_fbdlar.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><b>Why is this research important?</b></h2>
<p>With quantum holonomy theory we propose a completely new approach to one of the greatest scientific problems ever. We have already shown that the theory is a serious candidate for a final theory. We believe that it is imperative to further analyze this framework. </p>
<p>A final theory is expected to provide answers to some of the deepest questions in modern physics: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<i> What happened at t=0 at the </i><b><i>big bang</i></b><i>? </i>
</li>
<li>
<i> What is </i><b><i>dark matter</i></b><i> and </i><b><i>dark energy</i></b><i>? </i>
</li>
<li>
<i> What happens at the singularity of a </i><b><i>black hole</i></b><i>? </i>
</li>
<li>
<i> Are the </i><b><i>laws of physics</i></b><i> unique? </i>
</li>
<li>
<i> Will the </i><b><i>universe</i></b><i> expand forever?</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Curiosity is part of what makes us human. Science is about the big questions, the fundamental ""<i>Why</i>?"" that seizes us when we gaze into the night sky. This is an integral part of our cultural DNA.</p>
<p>We believe very deeply in our research and in the aspiration towards a final theory. We have given everything we've got to get this far.</p>

<h2><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></h2>
<p>This project has been a long time in the making. We spent more than a decade of research until we found what we were searching for. It is difficult to sustain funding for such a long period for a research project, that is far away from mainstream physics.</p>
<p>Our research has taken us into completely unchartered territory. We combine two very different and highly specialized research directions - <i>non-commutative geometry</i> and <i>canonical quantum gravity -</i>, neither of which are mainstream. It takes time for a new research direction to reach the level of impact required to secure a steady flow of funding. </p>
<p>This leaves us in the unusual situation where we have obtained strong results while at the same time are running out of money. Unless we get external funding we will not be able to continue our work. This is the reason why we now ask the crowdfunding community for support. </p>
<p>If you would like to have additional information about our previous and present funding situation you are welcome to contact us. You can also find more information on our home-pages.</p>
<h3><b>How we will spend the money</b></h3>
<p>The funding raised in this campaign will primarily be used to finance research time for Jesper Møller Grimstrup. In plain english this means salary. To make the funding last as long as possible Jesper will make do with a very modest salary.</p>
<p><b>Stretch goals</b></p>
<p>The more money we raise the more time we will have for research. We are deeply grateful for any support. We here formulate two additional <i>stretch goals</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a miracle happens and we manage to raise 200.000 $ we will buy Johannes Aastrup extra research time. </li>
<li>If two miracles happen and we raise 400.000 $ we will hire additional researchers to join us.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h2><b>More about the PHYSICS</b></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Let us finally provide a little more information on quantum holonomy theory. This part will involve a certain level of technicality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>The foundation</b></h3>
<p>The algebra, which we call the Q<i>uantum Holonomy-Diffeomorphism (QHD) algebra</i>, is build of two types of elements: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>so-called <i>holonomy-diffeomorphisms</i> on a 3-dimensional space. A holonomy-diffeomorphisms is the mathematical entity, that moves <i>stuff</i> in space. </li></ul>
<ul><li>certain translation operators that <i>shift</i> the way the holonomy-diffeomorphisms operate.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The first thing to note about the QHD algebra is that an infinitesimal version of its central algebraic relation is identical to what is called <i>the canonical commutation relation</i> of canonical quantum gravity formulated with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtekar_variables"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Ashtekar variables</span></a>. This means that a theory build over the QHD algebra automatically involves the kinematics of quantum gravity, i.e. <b>the basic requirement for a quantization of Einsteins theory general relativity</b>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore, the QHD algebra is <i>non-commutative</i>, which means that it naturally falls within the framework of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>non-commutative geometry</span></a>, a branch of modern mathematics, which has proven to be highly relevant for the question of how to unify the four fundamental forces of Nature. In our work we have shown that the QHD algebra in a semi-classical limit produces a so-called <i>almost-commutative algebra</i>, which is <b>the key ingredient in a unification scheme</b> due to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_standard_model"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alain Connes and Ali Chamseddine</a>. In that formulation the emergence of gauge and Higgs sectors - i.e. <i>fundamental forces and masses</i> - can be traced back to this almost-commutative algebra.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All together this means that the QHD algebra has a mathematical structure that makes it extremely interesting to study in the context of a unified theory of quantum gravity. It naturally combines the two most important ingredients for a fundamental theory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<b>Building the theory</b> </h3>
<p>Once we have the QHD algebra we need to build a theory around it. The first ingredient we require is a Hilbert space, which is the mathematical stage on which the algebra acts in order to produce the numbers, which may eventually be measured in experiments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To do this we first find a quantum state on the QHD algebra  -  this is the prerequisite for a Hilbert space. Once we have a single quantum state on the algebra we can use what is known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelfand%E2%80%93Naimark%E2%80%93Segal_construction"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>GNS construction</span></a> to build a Hilbert space. </p>
<p> </p>

STRETCH GOAL: $50,000. 
Thank you everyone for your support! We appreciate this very much.
_________________________________________________________________________
 
EINSTEIN spent the last 30 years of his life searching for an answer to the deepest question about the universe: does a fundamental principle, that governs all of reality, exist? He was searching for a unified field theory but he did not succeed.
In 2013 we, the theoretical physicist Jesper Møller Grimstrup and the mathematician Johannes Aastrup, discovered a simple mathematical principle, which we believe could be exactly what Einstein was searching for.
In a recent series of publications* we have shown that this principle, which we found after 10 years of research, entails a rich mathematical theory - we call it QUANTUM HOLONOMY THEORY - that shows signs of being a unified theory of quantum gravity. If our hypothesis is true it will revolutionize not only physics but science in general and beyond.
The purpose of this crowdfunding campaign is to secure the funding needed to further analyze this mathematical principle and the theory it entails and to determine if this really is a 'theory of everything'.
 
 

 
THE PRINCIPLE
The principle, which we discovered, is an algebra that essentially encodes how objects are moved in an abstract space. 
This elementary algebra simultaneously includes the fundamental premise of a quantum theory of gravity and a mathematical mechanism known to be related to a unification of the fundamental forces. This means that this algebra includes key elements of a unified theory of quantum gravity - the holy grail of modern physics.
Surprisingly, this algebra has never been studied before.
We found this algebra after many years of analysis, where we applied methods of modern mathematics to the questions of how to quantize Einsteins theory of general relativity and how to unify the four fundamental forces of Nature.
The reconciliation of quantum mechanics with Einsteins theory of relativity is the most important unsolved problem in modern theoretical physics and is believed to hold the key to some of the deepest mysteries about the universe and its origin.
 
Why is this algebra remarkable?
There are three features, which makes this algebra exceedingly interesting to study:

It is so elementary, that it seems immune to further reductions in the sense of being explained by other, deeper mathematical principles.
It gives rise to a rich mathematical structure, that links together several modern research programs in theoretical physics and mathematics.
It is so utterly natural.


 
 
THE THEORY
Our analysis so far shows that this algebra generates a complex mathematical theory, which we call quantum holonomy theory. This theory has a number of remarkable features:

It is a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. 
It includes matter with the correct coupling to gravity.
It produces a key mathematical mechanism that is known to be related to gauge degrees of freedom, i.e. fundamental forces.
It shows promising signs of being internally consistent.

These achievements are very non-trivial and make quantum holonomy theory an exciting candidate for a unified theory of quantum gravity.
Our results are either published in top international journals such as Communications in Mathematical Physics and Classical and Quantum Gravity or presently in the peer review process. For more information on quantum holonomy theory please check out this homepage or these papers*.
 
THE GOAL
There are two natural milestones for this project:


A consistent theory. A mathematical proof that quantum holonomy theory is internally consistent. In physics-lingo this means proving that the constraint algebra closes off-shell.

Proof of unification. Unambiguous proof that quantum holonomy theory is a theory of unification of the fundamental forces. In physics-lingo this means a clear connection to the non-commutative formulation of the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

If just one of these goals are met it will be clear that quantum holonomy theory is one of the most promising candidate for a final theory that is known today. 
The goal of this crowdfunding campaign is to meet at least one of these milestones. We believe that this is possible within five years.
 

 
 
Why is this research important?
With quantum holonomy theory we propose a completely new approach to one of the greatest scientific problems ever. We have already shown that the theory is a serious candidate for a final theory. We believe that it is imperative to further analyze this framework. 
A final theory is expected to provide answers to some of the deepest questions in modern physics: 


 What happened at t=0 at the big bang? 


 What is dark matter and dark energy? 


 What happens at the singularity of a black hole? 


 Are the laws of physics unique? 


 Will the universe expand forever?


Curiosity is part of what makes us human. Science is about the big questions, the fundamental ""Why?"" that seizes us when we gaze into the night sky. This is an integral part of our cultural DNA.
We believe very deeply in our research and in the aspiration towards a final theory. We have given everything we've got to get this far.

Jesper: ""This book will be about the why and whereto's, about the big questions and the big picture. I will explain how we came upon the ideas that lead us to quantum holonomy theory - a story that starts in the the militarized zone of Aksai Chin in the Tibetan Himalayas and involves both Kafka, Camus and the sci-fi movie Dark City; I will write about the background: Einsteins theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics and why most physicists believe that a theory, which combine these two, must exist; and I will write about quantum holonomy theory itself, the basic ideas and their implications. I will also write about what impact I believe the possible discovery of a final theory will have on society and on our perception of the world. Above all I will write about our fascination and love for our work. This book will be our main reward to our backers, either as an e-book or a proper book"".


Official acknowledgement. It is customary to acknowledge financial support in scientific publications. We pledge to acknowledge in detail the largest donations in our future publications. Thus, if you choose this option your name will appear in some of the top international scientific journals - listed in the acknowledgement section of our papers or on the front page. 

A newsletter. Everyone who supports us will receive a newsletter with updates on our research, new publications and general trends in modern physics. 
 
Why crowdfunding?
This project has been a long time in the making. We spent more than a decade of research until we found what we were searching for. It is difficult to sustain funding for such a long period for a research project, that is far away from mainstream physics.
Our research has taken us into completely unchartered territory. We combine two very different and highly specialized research directions - non-commutative geometry and canonical quantum gravity -, neither of which are mainstream. It takes time for a new research direction to reach the level of impact required to secure a steady flow of funding. 
This leaves us in the unusual situation where we have obtained strong results while at the same time are running out of money. Unless we get external funding we will not be able to continue our work. This is the reason why we now ask the crowdfunding community for support. 
If you would like to have additional information about our previous and present funding situation you are welcome to contact us. You can also find more information on our home-pages.
How we will spend the money
The funding raised in this campaign will primarily be used to finance research time for Jesper Møller Grimstrup. In plain english this means salary. To make the funding last as long as possible Jesper will make do with a very modest salary.
Stretch goals
The more money we raise the more time we will have for research. We are deeply grateful for any support. We here formulate two additional stretch goals:

If a miracle happens and we manage to raise 200.000 $ we will buy Johannes Aastrup extra research time. 
If two miracles happen and we raise 400.000 $ we will hire additional researchers to join us.


 
More about the PHYSICS
 
Let us finally provide a little more information on quantum holonomy theory. This part will involve a certain level of technicality.
 
The foundation
The algebra, which we call the Quantum Holonomy-Diffeomorphism (QHD) algebra, is build of two types of elements: 
 
so-called holonomy-diffeomorphisms on a 3-dimensional space. A holonomy-diffeomorphisms is the mathematical entity, that moves stuff in space. 
certain translation operators that shift the way the holonomy-diffeomorphisms operate.
 
The first thing to note about the QHD algebra is that an infinitesimal version of its central algebraic relation is identical to what is called the canonical commutation relation of canonical quantum gravity formulated with Ashtekar variables. This means that a theory build over the QHD algebra automatically involves the kinematics of quantum gravity, i.e. the basic requirement for a quantization of Einsteins theory general relativity. 
 
Furthermore, the QHD algebra is non-commutative, which means that it naturally falls within the framework of non-commutative geometry, a branch of modern mathematics, which has proven to be highly relevant for the question of how to unify the four fundamental forces of Nature. In our work we have shown that the QHD algebra in a semi-classical limit produces a so-called almost-commutative algebra, which is the key ingredient in a unification scheme due to Alain Connes and Ali Chamseddine. In that formulation the emergence of gauge and Higgs sectors - i.e. fundamental forces and masses - can be traced back to this almost-commutative algebra.
 
All together this means that the QHD algebra has a mathematical structure that makes it extremely interesting to study in the context of a unified theory of quantum gravity. It naturally combines the two most important ingredients for a fundamental theory.
 
 

Building the theory 
Once we have the QHD algebra we need to build a theory around it. The first ingredient we require is a Hilbert space, which is the mathematical stage on which the algebra acts in order to produce the numbers, which may eventually be measured in experiments.
 
To do this we first find a quantum state on the QHD algebra  -  this is the prerequisite for a Hilbert space. Once we have a single quantum state on the algebra we can use what is known as the GNS construction to build a Hilbert space. 
 
Once we have a Hilbert space we have essentially a quantum theory.
 
Incidentally, the states we find are semi-classical. This means that this theory already has a well-defined semi-classical approximation, an issue that is a serious challenge within other non-perturbative approaches to quantum theory of gravity.
 
Furthermore, it is an important result that the semi-classical limit of an operator, which resembles a curvature operator, produces the Hamiltonian of general relativity formulated in terms of Ashtekar variables. This means that Einsteins theory of general relativity emerges from this operator. 
 
In addition to all this we also find states in the kinematical Hilbert space, which produces what is known as the Dirac Hamiltonian in the semi-classical limit. This means that the theory also includes matter with the correct gravitational coupling.
 
With this brief tour we have a rough outline of quantum holonomy theory. We hope that it will be clear that the QHD algebra is worthy of further analysis. For more information please go to this homepage or contact us.

Risks & Challenges

In fundamental research there are no guarantees of success. Often things turn out different than anticipated and sometimes new directions of  research open op where old ideas failed. And there is always the possibility that you are working yourself down the wrong alley. This is what fundamental research is like. If we knew beforehand we would not need to look.
In the course of our own research careers we have encountered numerous setbacks. Every time this happens we pause, think, and push on. Like all researcher do.
We are however confident that no-matter what happens this project will generate a steady flow of scientific output.
If we obtain additional research funding during the timespan of this crowdfunding campaign we shall save the received money for later scientific use.

encouraged</b>, allowing to restrict the
mobility of women, their access to sports and the adoption
of Western style outfit. Bike Moms encourages the mom's will to learn to
ride a bicycle with a view to greater independence, social
and cultural integration and self-esteem. <b>We want, above all, that they will continue to use the bicycle as a mean of
personal transportation</b>, as a symbol of freedom and independence, as
a reason for well-being and health for themselves and for the others. <b>We need funds to close this year's budget and ensure the next one.</b></i></p>

ll corso prevede sia incontri teorici che, ovviamente, la pratica. Come
teoria, oltre alle <b>norme di sicurezza</b>, alle dotazioni di legge e al
Codice della Strada, abbiamo raccontato come la bicicletta sia
diventata, tra la fine dell'800 e il principio del '900, <b>il simbolo
dell'emancipazione e dell'indipendenza femminile</b> sia in Europa e in
America, cambiando perfino il modo di vestire! Le allieve ricevono
poi le <b>nozioni base di ciclomeccanica</b> e di <b>uso e manutenzione dei
diversi accessori</b>, come le luci e gli antifurti. Al termine del
programma, saranno anche analizzati i loro percorsi quotidiani e il
loro comportamento in strada. Le allieve cicliste, una volta imparato
ad andare in bici, <b>apriranno il corteo del CycloPride Day Milano
2016 (15 maggio 2016)</b>, una manifestazione che nelle passate edizioni ha visto oltre
30.000 partecipanti. </p>

<h3>Il Budget</h3>
<p><b>Ci servono almeno 10.000,00 Euro</b>. A cosa servono? Non lo stiamo già facendo? Sì, ma lo stiamo facendo gratis, e <b>un progetto così complesso non può proseguire su una base completamente volontaria.</b> Ci sono già alcune aziende che stanno sostenendo il progetto, donandoci materiale d'uso per il corso, come le prime 10 biciclette, e le ricompense legate alle vostre donazioni, come selle in edizione limitata, esclusive borse da viaggio e altro. Ma <b>se non arriveranno dei soldi, tutto questo si fermerà</b>. Non ci sarà un prossimo anno, come è successo in analoghe esperienze. Adesso, i soldi ci servono per pagare un minimo di rimborso spese a chi ci sta aiutando sia con le lezioni di teoria e pratica che con la comunicazione e l'impegno di progettazione e gestione del progetto. Inoltre vorremmo acquistare accessori necessari all'uso quotidiano della bicicletta, come delle rastrelliere robuste, da installare nelle abitazioni delle allieve, in modo da ridurre il rischio di furto e poter continuare a seguire le allieve degli anni precedenti. Infine, <b>per preparare l'espansione del progetto in un'altra città, vogliamo retribuire chi si potrà occupare della ricerca e della progettazione necessaria all'adattamento del corso a un'altro territorio.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b><i>Budget</i></b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>We
need at least 10,000.00 Euros</b>. Why? Are we not already doing it? Yes,
but we are doing it for free, and <b>we can't afford to manage such a complex project only on a voluntary basis.</b> Some companies are already supporting
the project, giving us material of use for the class for free, such as the first 10 bicycles, and the perks related to your donations, such as limited edition saddles, exclusive travel bags, and more. But <b>unless we get
some money, all this will stop in a flash</b>. There will be not a next year. We need money to pay a
minimum of reimbursement to those who are teaching both theory and
practice, or helping to design communication or doing the everyday
managing of the project. We would also like to buy some more
accessories like robust bike racks, to be installed in the women's
courtyards, in order to reduce theft risk. Finally, <b>in preparation
for the follow-up in at least one more city, we want to pay those who
will develop the necessary adaptation of the project to another
territory.</b></i></p>

</div></div>","MAMME
IN BICI è
una scuola di bicicletta per le donne di tutte le età e paesi nata a Milano: aiutaci ad andare avanti, anche in altre città!

BIKE MOMS is a bicycle class for women of all ages and countries settled in Milan, Italy: help us to keep going, also in other cities!

  Il Progetto 



Mamme in Bici è un corso di bicicletta gratuito rivolto a donne che non hanno mai avuto l’opportunità di imparare a pedalare. Siamo arrivati a 18 iscritte: Rania, Simona, Reem, Demiana, Carla e altre mamme e donne che provengono in gran parte da paesi in cui l’uso femminile della bicicletta è proibito, malvisto o comunque non incoraggiato, retaggio di una visione che ritiene più consono limitare la mobilità della donna, il suo accesso alle pratiche sportive e l’adozione di indumenti di fattura occidentale. Mamme in Bici accoglie la volontà di andare in bicicletta da parte delle donne in un’ottica di una maggiore indipendenza, integrazione sociale e culturale, autostima. Vogliamo, soprattutto, che dopo il corso le donne continuino a usare la bicicletta come mezzo di trasporto individuale, come simbolo di libertà e di indipendenza, come motivo di benessere e salute, per sé e per gli altri. Abbiamo bisogno di fondi per chiudere quest'anno e garantire il prossimo.


The Project
Bike
Moms is a no-profit bicycle class for women who have never had the opportunity
to learn to ride. 18 have enrolled so far: Rania, Simona, Reem,
Demiana, Carla and other moms and women who come largely from
countries where women's cycling is prohibited, disliked or not
encouraged, allowing to restrict the
mobility of women, their access to sports and the adoption
of Western style outfit. Bike Moms encourages the mom's will to learn to
ride a bicycle with a view to greater independence, social
and cultural integration and self-esteem. We want, above all, that they will continue to use the bicycle as a mean of
personal transportation, as a symbol of freedom and independence, as
a reason for well-being and health for themselves and for the others. We need funds to close this year's budget and ensure the next one.



Il Corso



ll corso prevede sia incontri teorici che, ovviamente, la pratica. Come
teoria, oltre alle norme di sicurezza, alle dotazioni di legge e al
Codice della Strada, abbiamo raccontato come la bicicletta sia
diventata, tra la fine dell'800 e il principio del '900, il simbolo
dell'emancipazione e dell'indipendenza femminile sia in Europa e in
America, cambiando perfino il modo di vestire! Le allieve ricevono
poi le nozioni base di ciclomeccanica e di uso e manutenzione dei
diversi accessori, come le luci e gli antifurti. Al termine del
programma, saranno anche analizzati i loro percorsi quotidiani e il
loro comportamento in strada. Le allieve cicliste, una volta imparato
ad andare in bici, apriranno il corteo del CycloPride Day Milano
2016 (15 maggio 2016), una manifestazione che nelle passate edizioni ha visto oltre
30.000 partecipanti. 



The bike class


The bike class includes lessons as well as practice. In addition to safety
standards and law prescriptions, we tell moms how the bicycle has become,
between the XIXth and the principle of XXth Centuries, the symbol of
women's emancipation and independence both in Europe and America,
even changing the way they used to dress! The Moms also receive the
bike maintenance and tech basics. At the end of the program, they
will also be analyzed their daily routes and their behavior in the
street. Once they've learned to ride a bike, they will open the bike
parade of Milan's CycloPride Day 2016 (May 15th, 2016), an event that in the past years
has seen more than 30,000 participants.




Il Crowdfunding

 


Siamo convinti che le attività di promozione sociale
siano realmente efficaci quando dimostrino di produrre ricchezza. I
vostri soldi ci servono per consolidare la struttura e l'operatività
del corso, ma anche per dare gioia e indipendenza ad altre donne,
facendo sì che questo progetto possa essere replicato sia a Milano che in altre
città. Per le allieve il corso è completamente gratuito. Al termine riceveranno una bicicletta e la relativa attrezzatura in regalo. Per noi che ci lavoriamo (siamo almeno in 10 ogni lezione, una volta alla settimana, per 6 mesi) è impegno volontario, ma crediamo che debba essere, almeno in parte, retribuito. 


Bike
Mums Crowdfunding 



We
are convinced that social promotion activities are really effective
when demonstrating to produce wealth. We need your money to enforce
structure and operation of the project, but also to give joy and
independence to other women, by ensuring that this project can be
replicated in Milan and in other italian cities. The bike class is totally free to moms. At the
end they will receive a bicycle and related equipment as a gift. For
us who work there (we are at least 10 per lesson, once a week, for 6
months) is a voluntary commitment, but we believe it should be, at
least in part, paid.







Il Budget
Ci servono almeno 10.000,00 Euro. A cosa servono? Non lo stiamo già facendo? Sì, ma lo stiamo facendo gratis, e un progetto così complesso non può proseguire su una base completamente volontaria. Ci sono già alcune aziende che stanno sostenendo il progetto, donandoci materiale d'uso per il corso, come le prime 10 biciclette, e le ricompense legate alle vostre donazioni, come selle in edizione limitata, esclusive borse da viaggio e altro. Ma se non arriveranno dei soldi, tutto questo si fermerà. Non ci sarà un prossimo anno, come è successo in analoghe esperienze. Adesso, i soldi ci servono per pagare un minimo di rimborso spese a chi ci sta aiutando sia con le lezioni di teoria e pratica che con la comunicazione e l'impegno di progettazione e gestione del progetto. Inoltre vorremmo acquistare accessori necessari all'uso quotidiano della bicicletta, come delle rastrelliere robuste, da installare nelle abitazioni delle allieve, in modo da ridurre il rischio di furto e poter continuare a seguire le allieve degli anni precedenti. Infine, per preparare l'espansione del progetto in un'altra città, vogliamo retribuire chi si potrà occupare della ricerca e della progettazione necessaria all'adattamento del corso a un'altro territorio.


Budget


We
need at least 10,000.00 Euros. Why? Are we not already doing it? Yes,
but we are doing it for free, and we can't afford to manage such a complex project only on a voluntary basis. Some companies are already supporting
the project, giving us material of use for the class for free, such as the first 10 bicycles, and the perks related to your donations, such as limited edition saddles, exclusive travel bags, and more. But unless we get
some money, all this will stop in a flash. There will be not a next year. We need money to pay a
minimum of reimbursement to those who are teaching both theory and
practice, or helping to design communication or doing the everyday
managing of the project. We would also like to buy some more
accessories like robust bike racks, to be installed in the women's
courtyards, in order to reduce theft risk. Finally, in preparation
for the follow-up in at least one more city, we want to pay those who
will develop the necessary adaptation of the project to another
territory.

</p><p><b>What is the
Crafty Workshop Project?</b></p>
<p>The Crafty workshop
project are people from all over the world who share a interest in
recycling, self sustainability, food security, free energy and the
sharing of knowledge.</p>
<p>The crafty workshop
project began in March 2015 as a website to share tips on recycling,
up cycling and re-purposing what most people would throw away, and
turn them into handy household items or gifts. In order to get the
website more traffic a Facebook group was started in the hope that a
few more people would get involved and from there the Crafty workshop
project became what it is today.</p>
<p>Now almost 9 months
later and the crafty workshop project has well over a thousand
members from across the globe, all sharing tips and tricks on all
manner of recycling, self sustainability and gardening projects.</p>
<p>With support and
interest from many other groups and organizations including charity
and established organizations, many have come to respect the crafty
workshop project and its work. The belief in sharing knowledge and
that knowledge should be free is still strong and dozens of ebooks
can be downloaded free off our website, on subjects such as keeping
chickens, free energy and building a home, with many more.</p>
<p>Recently a new
Facebook group emerged for children, Crafty project 4 kidz was
created to help children and encourage them to become more active in
the garden, and for children to become more nature and wildlife
aware. The group has now surpassed the original group in members and
is growing bigger everyday.</p><p>If you would like to apply to us for a copy or copies of the Game for your school, Community group or club please contact us via our website and click on applications on the home page menu.</p><p>Apply - <a href=""https://craftyworkshop.org/visiting-the-crafty-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://craftyworkshop.org/visiting-the-crafty-project/</a></p><p>Contact us - <a href=""https://craftyworkshop.org/contact/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://craftyworkshop.org/contact/</a><br/></p><p>Facebook - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/CraftyProject4Kidz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/CraftyProject4Kidz/</a></p><p>Facebook - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/craftyworkshop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/craftyworkshop/</a></p><p>Website - <a href=""http://craftyworkshop.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://craftyworkshop.org</a></p><p>Twitter - @workshopcrafty<br/></p>
<p><b>Sponsored by </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451927172/oddnfrbamobm4sh2ugl5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://www.permaculture.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.permaculture.co.uk/</a><br/></p><p><b>Why this
campaign.</b></p>
<p>The crafty workshop
strongly believe that in order for our future generations to have
food security and a green world to grow produce we need to start
teaching the younger generations knowledge of where food comes from,
what part nature and wildlife plays in our lives and with our food
production and how the climate and seasons are important to our
future on this planet.</p>
<p>Recycling, keeping
down our carbon footprints and shopping locally all help, but if this
knowledge is not passed down to the next generation then its all for
nothing.</p>
<p>Many children around
the world have no access to a garden or have even seen a farm animal,
the connection between the food in a supermarket and where it comes
from is none existent for many children.</p>
<p>We believe that
children learn through play best, and at the early ages children not
only learn the most about the world but also the blueprint for who
they will become as adults is formed, so with that in mind the crafty
workshop project with help from Feral Games, an independent tabletop
games company, got together and created the <i><b>How </b></i><i><b>D</b></i><i><b>oes
</b></i><i><b>Y</b></i><i><b>our </b></i><i><b>Garden</b></i><i><b>G</b></i><i><b>row</b></i> Board game and they found a
great, young local artist and started planning how the game would
work. The game needed to be fun and informative, and also much more
then just a game.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-QNA-vCiPFE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-QNA-vCiPFE%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-QNA-vCiPFE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><b>The Game and what
we have planned.</b></p>
<p>The game was created
and looks amazing, Holly Bushnell did an excellent job illustrating
the boards, tiles and playing cards and the game is fun and
informative, but now the game was made what next?</p>
<p>In keeping with the
crafty workshop belief that all knowledge is free we decided we would
give the game away for free to those children's community groups,
schools and nature clubs that applied for it so that where ever they
were in the world, children would have the opportunity to at least
learn about nature and hopefully be encouraged to go outside and
explore, start a vegetable patch or get involved with animal
sanctuaries. 
</p>
<p>We have had a great
response and support from many charities and they have decided to
show this by backing and sharing this campaign and have offered some
great perks for all of those that pledge their support.</p><p>
</p><p><b>Where you come in</b></p>
<p>In order for us to
produce the game and post it to these schools, communities and groups
we need your help. By pledging what you can, we will be able to get
the game made and sent globally and also as an added incentive we
will give a percentage of every pledge to our chosen charities
mentioned below. So not only are you helping children connect with
their world in various ways but you will also be helping wildlife and
Bee charities that do some great work.</p>
<p>And also by pledging
you can receive some great Perks from mugs and T shirts, to
Memberships and original Art and on to copies of the game and a
signed thank you Letter from Dr Brian May founder of the Save Me
Trust and Guitarist with the rock band Queen.</p><p><b>The Hedgehog
game.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449751372/l1tc4if2sejukvae844z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>As an extra
incentive we have also developed <i><b>Racing Hedgehog</b></i><i><b>s </b></i>a board game where you need to get your Hedgehog home whilst
avoiding the obstacles and dangers that hedgehogs face everyday. The
game was inspired by Brian May's interview as he held Percy the
Hedgehog which was rescued after being kicked and beaten by a group
of thugs. Unfortunately Percy was left brain damaged, but he now
lives with rock royalty in the sanctuary of Brian's garden.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fc1OIf-Q6uRk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dc1OIf-Q6uRk%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fc1OIf-Q6uRk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p>Save Me is a charity that speaks out about
the cruel minority in our society that feel it is their right to
persecute and torture wildlife for sport. Save Me arrived on the
scene during the run up to the 2010 elections.</p>
<p>It was evident that if the Conservatives became
elected then they would try to bring back fox hunting by repealing
the act. It was an issue firmly in their manifesto. The Conservative
government didn't get an outright majority and a new coalition
government was formed.</p>
<p>The badger cull was introduced by the coalition in
spite of all credible science stating that it would not work. They
cancelled five of the six vaccination projects that were underway and
regretted that later. In an EFRA select committee meeting on BTB,
they recognised it as a ""missed opportunity"". </p>
<p>The coalition forged ahead with the cull. We have
seen two years of culling in two pilot zones confirming that it is
ineffective, unsustainable and inhumane. It is one of our key issues.
 The repeal was not as simple as the party had hoped for, was
not sought during their time in office (2010-2015), and was prevented
by others within the coalition.</p><p>

<h3>Mission Statement </h3>
<p>We are committed to encouraging through knowledge
the integration of wildlife into our countryside and our gardens
alongside us in a natural balance. We help to preserve wildlife in
its natural environment by talking in schools and reaching the next
generation and via worksheets, direct animal contact and talks.</p>
<p>We encourage children and adults to care for their
environment and reduce the use of pesticides. We help to remove the
myths that surround our spectacular wildlife and encourage the next
generation to learn and understand that any space can be balanced and
can be a great environment for both humans and our native wildlife.</p><p>

<br/></div>","What is the
Crafty Workshop Project?
The Crafty workshop
project are people from all over the world who share a interest in
recycling, self sustainability, food security, free energy and the
sharing of knowledge.
The crafty workshop
project began in March 2015 as a website to share tips on recycling,
up cycling and re-purposing what most people would throw away, and
turn them into handy household items or gifts. In order to get the
website more traffic a Facebook group was started in the hope that a
few more people would get involved and from there the Crafty workshop
project became what it is today.
Now almost 9 months
later and the crafty workshop project has well over a thousand
members from across the globe, all sharing tips and tricks on all
manner of recycling, self sustainability and gardening projects.
With support and
interest from many other groups and organizations including charity
and established organizations, many have come to respect the crafty
workshop project and its work. The belief in sharing knowledge and
that knowledge should be free is still strong and dozens of ebooks
can be downloaded free off our website, on subjects such as keeping
chickens, free energy and building a home, with many more.
Recently a new
Facebook group emerged for children, Crafty project 4 kidz was
created to help children and encourage them to become more active in
the garden, and for children to become more nature and wildlife
aware. The group has now surpassed the original group in members and
is growing bigger everyday.If you would like to apply to us for a copy or copies of the Game for your school, Community group or club please contact us via our website and click on applications on the home page menu.Apply - https://craftyworkshop.org/visiting-the-crafty-project/Contact us - https://craftyworkshop.org/contact/Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/CraftyProject4Kidz/Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/craftyworkshop/Website - http://craftyworkshop.orgTwitter - @workshopcrafty
Sponsored by http://www.permaculture.co.uk/Why this
campaign.
The crafty workshop
strongly believe that in order for our future generations to have
food security and a green world to grow produce we need to start
teaching the younger generations knowledge of where food comes from,
what part nature and wildlife plays in our lives and with our food
production and how the climate and seasons are important to our
future on this planet.
Recycling, keeping
down our carbon footprints and shopping locally all help, but if this
knowledge is not passed down to the next generation then its all for
nothing.
Many children around
the world have no access to a garden or have even seen a farm animal,
the connection between the food in a supermarket and where it comes
from is none existent for many children.
We believe that
children learn through play best, and at the early ages children not
only learn the most about the world but also the blueprint for who
they will become as adults is formed, so with that in mind the crafty
workshop project with help from Feral Games, an independent tabletop
games company, got together and created the How Does
Your GardenGrow Board game and they found a
great, young local artist and started planning how the game would
work. The game needed to be fun and informative, and also much more
then just a game.
The Game and what
we have planned.
The game was created
and looks amazing, Holly Bushnell did an excellent job illustrating
the boards, tiles and playing cards and the game is fun and
informative, but now the game was made what next?
In keeping with the
crafty workshop belief that all knowledge is free we decided we would
give the game away for free to those children's community groups,
schools and nature clubs that applied for it so that where ever they
were in the world, children would have the opportunity to at least
learn about nature and hopefully be encouraged to go outside and
explore, start a vegetable patch or get involved with animal
sanctuaries. 

We have had a great
response and support from many charities and they have decided to
show this by backing and sharing this campaign and have offered some
great perks for all of those that pledge their support.
Where you come in
In order for us to
produce the game and post it to these schools, communities and groups
we need your help. By pledging what you can, we will be able to get
the game made and sent globally and also as an added incentive we
will give a percentage of every pledge to our chosen charities
mentioned below. So not only are you helping children connect with
their world in various ways but you will also be helping wildlife and
Bee charities that do some great work.
And also by pledging
you can receive some great Perks from mugs and T shirts, to
Memberships and original Art and on to copies of the game and a
signed thank you Letter from Dr Brian May founder of the Save Me
Trust and Guitarist with the rock band Queen.The Hedgehog
game.
As an extra
incentive we have also developed Racing Hedgehogs a board game where you need to get your Hedgehog home whilst
avoiding the obstacles and dangers that hedgehogs face everyday. The
game was inspired by Brian May's interview as he held Percy the
Hedgehog which was rescued after being kicked and beaten by a group
of thugs. Unfortunately Percy was left brain damaged, but he now
lives with rock royalty in the sanctuary of Brian's garden.
The Hedgehog game is
only available through this campaign and afterwards the Craft
workshop Project is donating it to the Save Me Trust. The games
artwork is once again done by Holly Bushnell and designed by Feral
Games.And you will also be Helping.We have chosen some great charities to support and they have been awesome in supporting this Campaign. Every time you pledge to us a percentage of that pledge gets shared amongst the charities we have adopted.

Save Me is a charity that speaks out about
the cruel minority in our society that feel it is their right to
persecute and torture wildlife for sport. Save Me arrived on the
scene during the run up to the 2010 elections.
It was evident that if the Conservatives became
elected then they would try to bring back fox hunting by repealing
the act. It was an issue firmly in their manifesto. The Conservative
government didn't get an outright majority and a new coalition
government was formed.
The badger cull was introduced by the coalition in
spite of all credible science stating that it would not work. They
cancelled five of the six vaccination projects that were underway and
regretted that later. In an EFRA select committee meeting on BTB,
they recognised it as a ""missed opportunity"". 
The coalition forged ahead with the cull. We have
seen two years of culling in two pilot zones confirming that it is
ineffective, unsustainable and inhumane. It is one of our key issues.
 The repeal was not as simple as the party had hoped for, was
not sought during their time in office (2010-2015), and was prevented
by others within the coalition.

Mission Statement 
We are committed to encouraging through knowledge
the integration of wildlife into our countryside and our gardens
alongside us in a natural balance. We help to preserve wildlife in
its natural environment by talking in schools and reaching the next
generation and via worksheets, direct animal contact and talks.
We encourage children and adults to care for their
environment and reduce the use of pesticides. We help to remove the
myths that surround our spectacular wildlife and encourage the next
generation to learn and understand that any space can be balanced and
can be a great environment for both humans and our native wildlife.

Wallasey HedgeHog Rescue is ran by a small group of volunteers who from their garden shed rescue injured HedgeHogs. They rely totally on donations and people offering their help.

Our purpose is to provide eye opening, mind opening and heart opening travel experiences to guests, while the profits serve the community thru outreach, humanitarian projects, programs, events, classes and other activities. Our goal is to provide our guests with an immersive cultural experience that respects the local traditions and has a sustainable and positive impact on the communities surrounding ""Uno Mundo"".</span></div><div><span><h3>

<p>     The location of this space is less than 8 miles from two humble, yet accommodating and relaxing beach towns,
with great surfing, fishing, sea turtle preservations, mangrove expeditions,
restaurants, bars, hostels, camping areas, rental establishments, sunsets and
more. We are also only 2 miles from Leon itself.</p>
<p>   Also in the
immediate area there is volcano hiking and boarding, horseback riding, zip
lining,  great restaurants and
entertainment, historical tours provided by living revolutionaries
(Sandanistas) and indigenous tribesmen, museums, protected areas, sacred grounds and
so much more.  Again, our purpose is to offer something undeniably beautiful and fulfilling to guests, while
our profits and presence serve the community.</p>

Throughout my journey in exploring and confirming this chosen path, I've learned to listen to the needs of the local communities that I have been working with. Uno Mundo has many principles and purposes, such as:</span></div><div>
<b>1.</b> Creating a positive impact on the community, economy and health of Nicaragua through humanitarian voluntourism.</div><div>
<b>2. </b>Offering a mindful travel destination that is sustainable, employs locals, honors and informs visitors of local and global cultures, and offers a safe, inexpensive and immersive experience.</div><p><b>3.</b> Working directly with orphans, street children, impoverished and abused children and their families.</p><div>
<b>4.</b> Inspiring all global community members to fearlessly live with passion and purpose, art and awareness, connection and compassion, healing and hope, and love and light!</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">    If we are to support and contribute to a community, we must first understand it and it's issues. The understanding I have gained in my  travels, research and meetings with more experienced philanthropists than myself, has transformed this vision into the financially sustainable design of ""Uno Mundo"". As the nature of voluntourism exposes people to a place and culture that they can either help or harm, we will take honor in facilitating a more respectful and responsible exchange. Since tourism is a necessity in some areas such as this, Uno Mundo's goal is not to interrupt the local economy or culture, but rather to extend ourselves to it in order to strengthen it. Through our mindful operations, we will contribute socially, and with the profits and programs recycling back into the community, our presence will have multiple layers of positive effect.</span></div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Property</h3><div>

<span>    Central American tourism directly influences the strength of the economy. Tourism</span><span> is the second largest industry in Nicaragua. President Ortega has publicly shown his support in growing this sector in order to reduce poverty throughout the country. </span>
</div><div>
<span>    Although Nicaragua is the poorest country in all of Latin American, it has also been ranked the safest Latin American country according to many sources, including Interpol. Regardless of these facts, tourism in Nicaragua has the greatest potential for growth through its resources, policies, and overall market climate. Leon has points of interest including ancient ruins, architectural tours, eco tours, surf breaks, market places, volcanos and the city itself.</span>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">    Ecotourism, agrotourism, voluntourism, adventure tourism and Central American tourism steadily and aggressively climb year after year.  Nicaraguan tourism has consistently grown at a rate of 10%-16% per year over the past 7 years exceeding the Latin American averages.  This growth is due in part to a diversified range of travel options in a safe environment, accessibility, national economic direction, with an unbelievable price tag. Our property is also a microcosm of that, with no direct competitors. </span><br/>
</div><div>
<span>    Within Nicaragua, Leon is a well traveled destination for its safe, clean, culturally and historically rich city. It's a gateway to two of the more relaxing yet accommodating beach towns, with good surf and many activities. There are many volcano hiking tours and one that's become quite popular is volcano boarding! The market analysis shows how a foreign investment of this nature, in this area would not only be secure, but beneficial for both investors and the community. </span><br/>
</div><div>
<span>    Round trip flights from California and New York are currently in the $400 range, although I'm sure the time of year has its
influence. Prices you can expect down here are often jaw droppingly low. For
example; breakfast $2-4, lunch $2-7, dinner $3 and up (there are nice
restaurants for fine dining), taxis to town $1-4, public transit 20 cents to
town 40 cents to beach, bus from Managua to Leon $2, local dorm room bed $5-8/
night, local private hostel room for 4 people or less $25-35/ night, local hotel
room $40 and up, beer $1.25-2, coffee &lt;$1, smoothies $1-3. The fish, fruit,
vegetables and usually meat are always fresh, not to mention the air. Wifi is

<div>    The Nicaraguan government and President Ortega have legislatively encouraged, supported and incentivized foreign investment on a globally recognized scale. For all tourism related businesses there is a 10 year, 100% tax exemption on property, income, import/export, sales and more, with a probability of a ten year extension. Currently tourism is the 2nd largest industry in Nicaragua with regulations and incentives maintaining a steady, yet astounding growth.  Furthermore, it positively impacts agriculture and development, which are currently the first and third largest industries. The timely support of the Nicaraguan government itself is directly in line with the launch of Uno Mundo.</div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Funding ""Uno Mundo""</h3>
<div>    The initial start up cost is only the mortgage
plus $5000 for the necessities to open. We can open for business almost immediately and begin sharing the goals of Uno Mundo with the
community!<br/>
</div>
<div>    We currently have approximately $60,000 invested in this
project and only need about $35,000 to purchase the land and all facilities except for the hostel and guest house. It has been negotiated as an owner financed, balloon
payment deal and with a substantial financial loss of money owed to me just
after closing, I am reaching out to our supporters to help us reach our goal. The funds are going directly to
purchase the property and to provide the perks listed for direct donations.  As for the two hostel buildings, I am renting those for
$500/month in order to secure a future purchase of $80,000. We can and will
function as an owner/renter business until our profits accumulate and other
arrangements are made in order to assume ownership of both properties. There are also a few hidden costs, such as; filing for residency, filing for business, lawyer fees, and a few more. Although the costs are minimal, transparency is of the utmost importance to us, so that supporters are fully aware of how the funding is being distributed.<br/>

</div></div>","UNO MUNDOA Humanitarian Retreat by Love Extends
Who We Are
 

    Hola! My name is Derek Racine, dreamer and founder of Love Extends and Uno Mundo. We are creating a place of peace, education, growth, inspiration, health, relaxation, self and community realization, with an emphasis on LOVE, through socio-cultural exchange and humanitarian efforts in Leon, Nicaragua.  
What is ""Uno Mundo""
    This humanitarian retreat is in a beautiful jungle setting, just outside Leon, a quaint, colonial, university city in Nicaragua. Our purpose is to provide eye opening, mind opening and heart opening travel experiences to guests, while the profits serve the community thru outreach, humanitarian projects, programs, events, classes and other activities. Our goal is to provide our guests with an immersive cultural experience that respects the local traditions and has a sustainable and positive impact on the communities surrounding ""Uno Mundo"".

     The location of this space is less than 8 miles from two humble, yet accommodating and relaxing beach towns,
with great surfing, fishing, sea turtle preservations, mangrove expeditions,
restaurants, bars, hostels, camping areas, rental establishments, sunsets and
more. We are also only 2 miles from Leon itself.
   Also in the
immediate area there is volcano hiking and boarding, horseback riding, zip
lining,  great restaurants and
entertainment, historical tours provided by living revolutionaries
(Sandanistas) and indigenous tribesmen, museums, protected areas, sacred grounds and
so much more.  Again, our purpose is to offer something undeniably beautiful and fulfilling to guests, while
our profits and presence serve the community.
Inspiration    This vision was inspired by my experience working with Latin American orphans, impoverished communities and finding the ideal to serve something greater than myself and provide to those in greater need than myself. Throughout my journey in exploring and confirming this chosen path, I've learned to listen to the needs of the local communities that I have been working with. Uno Mundo has many principles and purposes, such as:
1. Creating a positive impact on the community, economy and health of Nicaragua through humanitarian voluntourism.
2. Offering a mindful travel destination that is sustainable, employs locals, honors and informs visitors of local and global cultures, and offers a safe, inexpensive and immersive experience.3. Working directly with orphans, street children, impoverished and abused children and their families.
4. Inspiring all global community members to fearlessly live with passion and purpose, art and awareness, connection and compassion, healing and hope, and love and light!    If we are to support and contribute to a community, we must first understand it and it's issues. The understanding I have gained in my  travels, research and meetings with more experienced philanthropists than myself, has transformed this vision into the financially sustainable design of ""Uno Mundo"". As the nature of voluntourism exposes people to a place and culture that they can either help or harm, we will take honor in facilitating a more respectful and responsible exchange. Since tourism is a necessity in some areas such as this, Uno Mundo's goal is not to interrupt the local economy or culture, but rather to extend ourselves to it in order to strengthen it. Through our mindful operations, we will contribute socially, and with the profits and programs recycling back into the community, our presence will have multiple layers of positive effect.The Property
        
       
    The property is turn key with a face lift, so the purchase price includes all accommodations and amenities that an eco resort would require. With some cleaning, painting, landscaping and minimal repair, we can open for business and begin sharing ourselves with the community.     This opportunity came to us through a blend of human intention and divine intervention, which is the energy we seek to spread and sustain. The land has been developed and includes: -75+ person hostel which entails 5 large dorm rooms with full bathrooms-1 private suite (4 person or less)-large communal kitchen (centrally located)-private pool and patio-2 recreation rooms-Large covered outdoor area with bar, study, garden -Guest house with sanctuary. -4 pools -Auditorium-Patio style restaurant
-Additional amenities include picnic areas, playgrounds, pavilions, patios, ponds, gardens, water fountains, a fresh spring creek, wild life, fruit trees and in the future tree houses, cabanas, farm/ocean/tree to table restaurant and more. 
       
    Much excitement comes from the fact that we are purchasing a fully operational property with no further costs outside of the potential expansion! Uno Mundo will be able to open immediately after obtaining the property.
Building Community Bridges
     We will have international volunteers and local staff sharing responsibilities with daily operations and with standard minimum wage at $1/ hr, we can immediately offer better wages, resulting in higher quality staff and a higher quality of life for employees. We also have ample space to house staff if necessary. The facilities and ambience lend itself to group retreats, events and festivals as well. It has an energy for retreats such as yoga, family, couples, healing, surfing, and a variety of others. I can envision daily/hourly events such as weddings, quinceneras, birthdays, reunions, holiday parties, barbecues, corporate and more. In fact, part of the property was a family park and restaurant that the entire community already knows, loves and respects. It closed down two years ago, as family ownership moved on and now it just awaits a fresh direction, a little funding and some good energy. Why Leon, Nicaragua?                   
    Central American tourism directly influences the strength of the economy. Tourism is the second largest industry in Nicaragua. President Ortega has publicly shown his support in growing this sector in order to reduce poverty throughout the country. 

    Although Nicaragua is the poorest country in all of Latin American, it has also been ranked the safest Latin American country according to many sources, including Interpol. Regardless of these facts, tourism in Nicaragua has the greatest potential for growth through its resources, policies, and overall market climate. Leon has points of interest including ancient ruins, architectural tours, eco tours, surf breaks, market places, volcanos and the city itself.

    Ecotourism, agrotourism, voluntourism, adventure tourism and Central American tourism steadily and aggressively climb year after year.  Nicaraguan tourism has consistently grown at a rate of 10%-16% per year over the past 7 years exceeding the Latin American averages.  This growth is due in part to a diversified range of travel options in a safe environment, accessibility, national economic direction, with an unbelievable price tag. Our property is also a microcosm of that, with no direct competitors. 

    Within Nicaragua, Leon is a well traveled destination for its safe, clean, culturally and historically rich city. It's a gateway to two of the more relaxing yet accommodating beach towns, with good surf and many activities. There are many volcano hiking tours and one that's become quite popular is volcano boarding! The market analysis shows how a foreign investment of this nature, in this area would not only be secure, but beneficial for both investors and the community. 

    Round trip flights from California and New York are currently in the $400 range, although I'm sure the time of year has its
influence. Prices you can expect down here are often jaw droppingly low. For
example; breakfast $2-4, lunch $2-7, dinner $3 and up (there are nice
restaurants for fine dining), taxis to town $1-4, public transit 20 cents to
town 40 cents to beach, bus from Managua to Leon $2, local dorm room bed $5-8/
night, local private hostel room for 4 people or less $25-35/ night, local hotel
room $40 and up, beer $1.25-2, coffee <$1, smoothies $1-3. The fish, fruit,
vegetables and usually meat are always fresh, not to mention the air. Wifi is
available almost everywhere these days and even at Uno Mundo. Nicaragua offers an unrivaled cost of traveling/living (for what its worth), allowing travelers to experience everything while staying well within their traveling budget.
Nicaraguan Land and Business Investment Climate

    The Nicaraguan government and President Ortega have legislatively encouraged, supported and incentivized foreign investment on a globally recognized scale. For all tourism related businesses there is a 10 year, 100% tax exemption on property, income, import/export, sales and more, with a probability of a ten year extension. Currently tourism is the 2nd largest industry in Nicaragua with regulations and incentives maintaining a steady, yet astounding growth.  Furthermore, it positively impacts agriculture and development, which are currently the first and third largest industries. The timely support of the Nicaraguan government itself is directly in line with the launch of Uno Mundo.

Funding ""Uno Mundo""
    The initial start up cost is only the mortgage
plus $5000 for the necessities to open. We can open for business almost immediately and begin sharing the goals of Uno Mundo with the
community!

    We currently have approximately $60,000 invested in this
project and only need about $35,000 to purchase the land and all facilities except for the hostel and guest house. It has been negotiated as an owner financed, balloon
payment deal and with a substantial financial loss of money owed to me just
after closing, I am reaching out to our supporters to help us reach our goal. The funds are going directly to
purchase the property and to provide the perks listed for direct donations.  As for the two hostel buildings, I am renting those for
$500/month in order to secure a future purchase of $80,000. We can and will
function as an owner/renter business until our profits accumulate and other
arrangements are made in order to assume ownership of both properties. There are also a few hidden costs, such as; filing for residency, filing for business, lawyer fees, and a few more. Although the costs are minimal, transparency is of the utmost importance to us, so that supporters are fully aware of how the funding is being distributed.
 
Skills and Experience




    I have been an enthusiast of many things throughout my life. As the visionary of this project I've realized how essential a diverse and specific skill set will be in the realization of such an endeavor. Unbeknownst to me at the time, I began acquiring fully applicable skills and experience for this venture, at a very young age, working on the family campground. I would later gain 20 more years of experience within the hospitality and food business. Beginning with entry level positions and working my way up through management, has given me a thorough understanding of the necessary mechanisms of hospitality operations. It has also given me a sense of what each staff member may be facing or feeling based on their position, in order to better facilitate responsibilities. Combined with an educational background in socio-cultural anthropology, recent travels to and integration into the local community, and intermediate Spanish skills, I am confident in my abilities to plan, train, supervise and overall manage such an endeavor. I also have adequate experience in commercial farming, construction (many trades), teaching and coaching (sports, arts, academic subjects, etc), community organizing, event planning, and child care. The experiences I've had working with Latin American orphans has certainly been the most useful and inspirational components to the vision and its future success. 


    Through the years, a very dedicated and diverse group of people have entered my life, enhanced it and continue to support it. Onboard supporters include professionals and enthusiasts from just about every field imaginable! Some will help finance, others volunteer. Some will volunteer on site and others, their services and wisdom from their place of residence. All in all, we have just about every resource possible, so right now the goal is to pool and activate them, with funding taking priority to secure the property! 

               Risks and Challenges
- The main challenge is acquiring the remaining start up costs. Many foreigners are hesitant to invest in Nicaragua due to misleading propaganda over the years and an unfamiliar business atmosphere, but I assure you it's secure, growing and has many incentives.  
- There are many other hotels and hostels in the area, though our design, approach and environment leave us without any direct competitors. 
- Balancing the personalities on site will be difficult.

<p dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>I spent the last few years in fashion design school, believing that if I was good enough at school and had career and success, I would find fulfillment. Late at night, when riding my bike home through deserted, quiet streets, I would feel a hollowness. With every failing relationship, that hollowness grew.  I was looking for enjoyment and pleasure outside of myself and not finding it.<br/><br/>I came to Orgasmic Meditation because I had a sense that sex had something to do with my chronic dissatisfaction.  That the fulfillment I was seeking resided in the location I was most hesitant to look.  <br/><br/>Two years of OM practice later, I’ve found a new, sustainable source of nourishment.  Where I was once was quiet, passive, and internal, now I have a certainty and confidence in myself.   Where I was meek and shut down, now I speak without apology.  I finally found my voice.  The chronic dissatisfaction has evaporated.  I can thank OM for this.<br/><br/>I want to deepen my practice and teach others how to alleviate their chronic dissatisfaction and live an uncompromised life.  I put down a $1000 deposit for a coach training program that will train me to bring others this practice.  In learning to train others, I will be learning more about myself.  I am looking to YOU to help me raise the rest of the tuition to bring this transformative and life changing work to the world.<br/><strong><strong><br/><br/><br/></strong></strong></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>{What I Need &amp; What You Get}</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>I need {$14,000} for Coach training tuition.  The program is ten months long, starting in September 2012.  It's facilitated by a company called OneTaste, whose purpose is to spread turnON and put OM up there with yoga and meditation.  <br/><br/>My gifts to you:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">OM training-  In three sessions I will train you to OM.  OMing is a partner practice, so if you don’t have a partner, we will work on getting you to a point of asking somebody to OM.  If you can ask somebody to tea, you can ask them to OM.</li>
</ul><p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">Life coaching-  Four sessions where we address what you need to find your life TurnedON and then how you’ll go for it.  You will be part of my learning experience and we will both go on an amazing, possibly scary, hot ride together.  Take the leap of faith and dive in with me.  </li>
</ul><p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">Be a part of #projectOrgasm- Gain access to my interactive blog, #projectOrgasm.  I will be updating daily, with my OM video diary, turnedON songs of the day, frame of sensation tweets, an orgasm photo journal, and more.  You ask me questions, and I do research and report back to you, with video interviews or written posts.  This is the place where I delve into orgasm and report back to you.  </li>

</ul></div>","{My Story}
I spent the last few years in fashion design school, believing that if I was good enough at school and had career and success, I would find fulfillment. Late at night, when riding my bike home through deserted, quiet streets, I would feel a hollowness. With every failing relationship, that hollowness grew.  I was looking for enjoyment and pleasure outside of myself and not finding it.I came to Orgasmic Meditation because I had a sense that sex had something to do with my chronic dissatisfaction.  That the fulfillment I was seeking resided in the location I was most hesitant to look.  Two years of OM practice later, I’ve found a new, sustainable source of nourishment.  Where I was once was quiet, passive, and internal, now I have a certainty and confidence in myself.   Where I was meek and shut down, now I speak without apology.  I finally found my voice.  The chronic dissatisfaction has evaporated.  I can thank OM for this.I want to deepen my practice and teach others how to alleviate their chronic dissatisfaction and live an uncompromised life.  I put down a $1000 deposit for a coach training program that will train me to bring others this practice.  In learning to train others, I will be learning more about myself.  I am looking to YOU to help me raise the rest of the tuition to bring this transformative and life changing work to the world.
{What I Need & What You Get}
I need {$14,000} for Coach training tuition.  The program is ten months long, starting in September 2012.  It's facilitated by a company called OneTaste, whose purpose is to spread turnON and put OM up there with yoga and meditation.  My gifts to you:

OM training-  In three sessions I will train you to OM.  OMing is a partner practice, so if you don’t have a partner, we will work on getting you to a point of asking somebody to OM.  If you can ask somebody to tea, you can ask them to OM.
 

Life coaching-  Four sessions where we address what you need to find your life TurnedON and then how you’ll go for it.  You will be part of my learning experience and we will both go on an amazing, possibly scary, hot ride together.  Take the leap of faith and dive in with me.  
 

Be a part of #projectOrgasm- Gain access to my interactive blog, #projectOrgasm.  I will be updating daily, with my OM video diary, turnedON songs of the day, frame of sensation tweets, an orgasm photo journal, and more.  You ask me questions, and I do research and report back to you, with video interviews or written posts.  This is the place where I delve into orgasm and report back to you.  
 

TurnedON styling and photography-  What does your most turnedON self look like?  What is the *flavor* of your orgasm? Spicy? Sweet? Earthy and dark?  I am a San Francisco native and a fashion designer- so naturally I knows all the shopping spots and places to go, no matter what your interest or style.  
 

Personalized tour of SF- As an SF native, I am confident that I can take you on an amazing San Francisco tour. Historical sites, little alcoves only us locals know about, and amazing views and sites to see, and hidden San Francisco oddities.

{Why OM is important for the World}
OM is the [esc] key when the program of your life just isn’t working any more. OM lights you up.  It gives you spontaneity and flow.  It brings love into your life.  It spurs you to start something new.  It makes you dance.  It helps you talk to their partner.  It encourages your body to go after what you want.  It brings you out of your head and into your body.  It can make you cry and laugh, at the same time.  And the orgasm that lasts fifteen minutes, spills into the rest of your life.  You can live in orgasm, all the time.I can’t wait to take this coaching program.  With your donations, I can do it.  Through this program, you will help me launch Leah 2.0 and help me bring people their own personal upgrades.No dough?  You can still contribute!How? By getting the word out, by sharing!
