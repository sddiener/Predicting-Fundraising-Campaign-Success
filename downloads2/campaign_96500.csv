<p>Hi, I'm Yasin. A writer, podcaster and board game designer based in the UK. The aim of Qasaaro is quite simple - to bring the kids, Hooyo and Aabo, Adheer, and anti-social teenager around one table for a joyous, and educational experience. </p>

<p>How often do we speak to our family? According to recent reports, the average family spends 34 minutes together <strong>a day. </strong></p>

A secret high tech cult, lead by Celestials but including among its ranks men and Replicants and more, known as the Redeemers, bide their time and await Mother's return, to make the Galaxy whole. They know that in new forms they may not recognize that She is coming.They are right.The End, IncompletePlease help me make the greatest science fiction roleplaying game and setting the world has ever seen into one big, beautiful, FULL COLOR book, and you will get that book, and my eternal thanks!<End Transmission>",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>Space Cats allows you to travel to the edge of the universe, going where no one has ever gone before, exploring new planets, fighting vile creatures, meeting strange and wild galactic animals. Yeah, you read that right! In a faraway future or a distorted past—it doesn’t really matter—animals dominate an entire galaxy, with their eccentric craziness, their cuteness, and their courage. Take your ray-gun weapons, your light swords and fasten your seat belts, for we are about to embark on a journey at warp speed to Animalaxia, where animals rule!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555800659/qhggt5a7w3ufdzznt9s9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Space Cats is a <strong>complete RPG for children</strong>, inspired by classic sci-fi movies and shows, like Star Trek, Star Wars, Lost in Space, etc. Space Cats uses a simplified version of Fate Accelerated, published by Evil Hat. Rather than using Fate Dice, <strong>Space Cats uses tokens</strong> and provides <strong>rules of engagement for group work, friendship, and brotherhood</strong>.</p>
<p>Space Cats was initially created to raise funds in an attempt to help sick kittens that were abandoned on the streets. With this project, we have been able to donate to NGOs dedicated to animal welfare causes here in Brazil, such as AARG in Gravatá, Pernambuco, and Pata Voluntária in Maceió, Alagoas.</p>
<p>The game is already in English, and I count on the help of some friends to do the initial proofreading. This campaign will help me create the following art-work, edit and pay a professional proofreader to improve the text quality, but I have a particular destination for some of the Money.</p>

<p>I love animals, but I live in a small house in a country town. I'm not part of an NGO or anything, but I have rescued some kittens from the streets and this has sent my bills through the roof. I work as a freelance illustrator and I am now writing for RPG games (especially for Fate).</p>
<p>With this project I intend to pay my increasing bills so that my cats can have food, medication, and visit the vet in the next few months, while I work on the artwork for this book.</p>
<p>Also, as extra goals, I will include values for donations to NGOs that care for animals in Brazil.</p>

<p>Space Cats contains a ready to play adventure that serves as an example of how the game works. You can play this adventure with any player, regardless of their age.</p>

<p>My name is Fábio Silva, I'm a Brazilian graphic designer and author. I love animals, music, art, comics, books, and RPG. In 2017 I created the Space Cats project in Portuguese to raise money for kittens that I had rescued from the streets of my small town in the Brazilian countryside.</p>
<p>Today I work as an illustrator and write my ideas for RPG, especially for the Fate system.</p>

<p>Cezar Capacle is an architect, tabletop game designer, musician and overall an inquisitive nerd. He's really into minimalistic games and joined the Space Cats project after an overload of suggestions that meant  he was finally granted co-authorship of this project. He's in charge of Not A Giraffe Studio, an independent game design effort with titles published in English, Portuguese and French.</p>

<p>I do all of this because I love it and it's fun. But I hope to help some that cross my path.</p>
<p>When I created Space Cats it was just an idea. I was not planning to open a company. I like to write and draw and things got together especially when I was needing  money to save some of my cats. They got sick and the treatment it was expensive.</p>
<p>But things went well. I was able to donate 90% of the profit from the first crowdfunding and since then, 10% of all the projects that I launch. I intend to continue to do so. Let's play some RPG and help those who need it.</p>

<p>There are some costs involved in producing this book. Although Space Cats is an independent book, I need to make sure my cats are okay for the next few months so I can continue to work on my artwork. The Space Cats team is small, so there is a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Fábio Silva:</strong> I am responsible for the translation, artwork (cover and internal) and editing (layout) of the book.</p>
<p><strong>Cezar Capacle:</strong> co-author, game designer, and proofreader.</p>

</div></div>","Space Cats allows you to travel to the edge of the universe, going where no one has ever gone before, exploring new planets, fighting vile creatures, meeting strange and wild galactic animals. Yeah, you read that right! In a faraway future or a distorted past—it doesn’t really matter—animals dominate an entire galaxy, with their eccentric craziness, their cuteness, and their courage. Take your ray-gun weapons, your light swords and fasten your seat belts, for we are about to embark on a journey at warp speed to Animalaxia, where animals rule!

Space Cats is a complete RPG for children, inspired by classic sci-fi movies and shows, like Star Trek, Star Wars, Lost in Space, etc. Space Cats uses a simplified version of Fate Accelerated, published by Evil Hat. Rather than using Fate Dice, Space Cats uses tokens and provides rules of engagement for group work, friendship, and brotherhood.
Space Cats was initially created to raise funds in an attempt to help sick kittens that were abandoned on the streets. With this project, we have been able to donate to NGOs dedicated to animal welfare causes here in Brazil, such as AARG in Gravatá, Pernambuco, and Pata Voluntária in Maceió, Alagoas.
The game is already in English, and I count on the help of some friends to do the initial proofreading. This campaign will help me create the following art-work, edit and pay a professional proofreader to improve the text quality, but I have a particular destination for some of the Money.

 

I love animals, but I live in a small house in a country town. I'm not part of an NGO or anything, but I have rescued some kittens from the streets and this has sent my bills through the roof. I work as a freelance illustrator and I am now writing for RPG games (especially for Fate).
With this project I intend to pay my increasing bills so that my cats can have food, medication, and visit the vet in the next few months, while I work on the artwork for this book.
Also, as extra goals, I will include values for donations to NGOs that care for animals in Brazil.

 

About 50 to 60 pages of original content, size A5 (15cm x 21cm or 5.83"" x 8.27"")
Space Cats has an original and fun scenario so you can create and play uncountable adventures with your group.
Complete rules: You don't need any other book to play the game
Space Cats has everything you need to play. The book presents six chapters that explain the scenario, character creation, the gameplay rules, the role of the storyteller, how to create your adventures and finally, a full introductory adventure.
A complete adventure so you can start to play quickly with your group
Space Cats contains a ready to play adventure that serves as an example of how the game works. You can play this adventure with any player, regardless of their age.
20 full-color original arts
Space Cats will be published as a full-color PDF.  It will also be available as  print on demand with the following features; both softcover or hardcover, black and white or colorful so everyone can have access to the book. All artwork is original and has been created by the author of the book.

My name is Fábio Silva, I'm a Brazilian graphic designer and author. I love animals, music, art, comics, books, and RPG. In 2017 I created the Space Cats project in Portuguese to raise money for kittens that I had rescued from the streets of my small town in the Brazilian countryside.
Today I work as an illustrator and write my ideas for RPG, especially for the Fate system.

Cezar Capacle is an architect, tabletop game designer, musician and overall an inquisitive nerd. He's really into minimalistic games and joined the Space Cats project after an overload of suggestions that meant  he was finally granted co-authorship of this project. He's in charge of Not A Giraffe Studio, an independent game design effort with titles published in English, Portuguese and French.

I do all of this because I love it and it's fun. But I hope to help some that cross my path.
When I created Space Cats it was just an idea. I was not planning to open a company. I like to write and draw and things got together especially when I was needing  money to save some of my cats. They got sick and the treatment it was expensive.
But things went well. I was able to donate 90% of the profit from the first crowdfunding and since then, 10% of all the projects that I launch. I intend to continue to do so. Let's play some RPG and help those who need it.

There are some costs involved in producing this book. Although Space Cats is an independent book, I need to make sure my cats are okay for the next few months so I can continue to work on my artwork. The Space Cats team is small, so there is a lot of work to be done.
Fábio Silva: I am responsible for the translation, artwork (cover and internal) and editing (layout) of the book.
Cezar Capacle: co-author, game designer, and proofreader.
The book will be produced by Print on Demand, and backers will either receive a PDF or a PDF + Print at Cost Coupon to print the book over DrivethruRPG.
 

All backers get immediate access to the book's draft text (see the first Update of the campaign). By helping us make this project real, you can receive:

That's it. For children, King of thought can help them improve their language development and build up the linkage between vocabularies.  For adults, besides having fun and improving thinking and imagination.King of Thought can be used as a practice tool for people who have language and thinking problems such as having difficulty of finding words, or people who have brain injury affecting on language capacity.This game is for 2+ persons, age 5 to 99+, 5 - 10 mins to play each round.   We provide seven different options to play the game in the instruction manual but you can create other options and play it in your own fun way.

<h3>My name is Zach.</h3>
<p>Here is a brief history of how the <i>Teacher-Gamer Handbook</i> came to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1982 played <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> for the first time - my character died in the first 10 minutes, it was so fascinating and unlike anything I had ever experienced... I was hooked! I have been playing RPGs for thousands of hours and almost 4 decades. Some would call me an O.G. (Original Gamer).</p></li>
<li>1990’s adventuring in life, school, work, music production, becoming Canadian and starting a family steered me in new directions. </li>
<li>2002+ raising two boys with my wife Sophie, I was teaching and studying by day, hangin' with the family and playing RPGs when I could on weekends.</li>
<li>2006 enrolled in an MA program in Education to better understand the “how” of teaching and learning.</li>
<li>2010 finished my Masters in Education focused on authentic learning and life-skills curriculum development.</li>
<li>2012 realized that role-playing games (RPGs) in Schools was an untapped resource. I began working on the Teacher-Gamer as an extension of my Distinct Self well-being program. </li>
<li>2014-2016 brought <strong><i>RPGs in Schools</i></strong> curriculum into the classroom at Green School Bali</li>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583992967/ykrnr5zvh3poqdnuhhoi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I started this campaign for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is time to put the Teacher-Gamer Revolution on the timeline, now, globally. It is so important to take what you have inside you and put it into the civic sphere. I urge all educators to make the world a better place by combining their passions with their pedagogical skills and make them available to the public.</li>
<li>Self-publishing the Teacher-Gamer Handbook (TGHB) will launch this new step of my career with all the support of my colleagues, friends and anyone who likes the idea that robust off-screen game-system-learning (engaging face-to-face life-skills development) is a viable initiative to balance the influx of technology into schools. </li>
<li>The TGHB is my calling card, a beacon, an organized methodology that I can put into the hands of people I meet at conferences, conventions and school boards wherever I go.  </li>
</ol>
<p>I took a calculated risk and have already borrowed the money to: </p>
<ul>
<li>finish the book </li>
<li>have it typeset in the style of a role-playing game handbook </li>
<li>make videos to explain how teaching RPGs in schools works</li>
<li>build a website with a private interactive forum. </li>
</ul>
<p>I also plan to use the momentum and connections I make with so many people around the world to <strong>take the curriculum to the next level</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585056311/xclhkjyg8acxxosh74je.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to hit at least $60,000 so that I can spread the methodology online and hit the road when the world opens up again to safe conferences and in-person education.</p>
<p>Here's the Teacher-Gamer Revolution plan for the funds raised on IndieGoGo: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hard Copy</strong> prints of the book for everyone!</li>
<li>Hit our stretch goals and produce additional resources for Teacher-Gamers to accompany the Handbook.<ul>
<li>
<strong>Newsletters</strong> with practical activities</li>
<li><strong>Instructional videos</strong></li>
<li>Teacher-gamer <strong>website features</strong> celebrating educator success around the world  </li>
<li>Weekly <strong>Webinars</strong> for online outreach and support </li>
<li>Teacher <strong>training workshop</strong> deployment to implement new full-scale RPGs in the classroom programs.</li>
<li>Head to <strong>Conferences and speaking events</strong> to grow the community and gain traction.</li>
<li>Continued <strong>customization of RPGs in Schools curriculum</strong> in community centers, school boards, correctional facilities and homeschools far and wide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finish the next three handbooks full of additional lesson plans, classroom activities and teaching strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584028328/zeg1t23awekyddtsib4m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Benefits for the Educators</h2>
<ul>
<li>help schools transition into more life-skills programs that prepare youth for adulthood</li>
<li>build progressive opportunities for face-to-face off-screen courses in schools</li>
<li>maintain positive attitudes about the future of schools</li>
<li>work to make life-skills more prominent in schools for the subject teacher who is getting pushed out by tech </li>
<li>Strengthen relationships with students through gameplay</li>
</ul>
<p>The last thing a teacher wants to feel like is “obsolete”. There is some hustle each teacher must do to remain fresh, viable and relevant in their community, but if teachers are trying to battle incoming tech or are being asked to do more tech type roles, they will have to find ways to shift the consciousness of the institutes they work in or be moved around or pushed out. </p>
<p>This is a call to teachers to take their passions- or at least an opportunity to pick up this methodology to teach games- and deploy life-skills into their learning environment.  </p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584006728/p6jlw1f4nrkyspemd8e3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Teacher-Gamer Handbook has been over 8 years in the making! </p>
<p>The RPGs in Schools program was originally developed as an extension to a Personal and Social Development Local Programme course cycle in Canadian public school – a well-being curriculum program of life-skills electives at The English Montreal School Board in Quebec. Since then, the RPGs in Schools program has been adapted into the Wild Mind Training resiliency program for youth, 10 years old and older in schools and camps in Indonesia and the UK where I have been working over the last 6 years.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9fTqXwL-Jg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Starting in 2014, Green School Bali was an early adopter of the RPGs in Schools Program where I ran Introduction to Dungeons and Dragons as an English literacy course (creative writing) in high school and as an English literacy course (communication thematic) in middle school.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585051583/kl0hffgywbifxb9jxegl.jpg"" src=""""/>Every child surveyed in Green School reported that they liked the RPGs class and over half of them considered it their favorite class!</p>
<p>As I went along, I started realizing that all the life skills (21 basic and 15 advanced) that I was teaching could be dialed in to meet various curriculum goals and that if I put learners on a narrative cycle such as the Hero’s Journey, they would begin to recognize so many more <strong>thematics, symbols, motifs </strong>and<strong> literary forms</strong> as they relate to so many of the stories, books, films, TV series, mangas and other sagas that they follow.</p>
<p>Re-branded as <i><strong>Wild Mind Training</strong></i>, over the last 4 years. I have been experimenting with more <strong>mindfulness, wilderness conservation</strong> and<strong> improvisational theatre</strong> elements. As a home school aggregate on the weekdays and a weekend workshop for day school children, I have ironed out the kinks of <u>three different levels of Introduction to Life-Skills through 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons</u> courses. </p>
<p>As with any pedagogy delivery system, the context and content (ie. role-playing game being used) can be adjusted into the area of study or subject. What matters most is that <strong>the learning system is authentically motivating</strong> and delivers opportunity after opportunity to acquire literacy, socio-emotional and life skills.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585059304/qbliilmrvrnzsh5nrlra.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When teacher-gamers, homeschool parents, mindfulness trainers, socio-emotional counselors and wilderness survival instructors get a hold of this book they will find it easy to use and with plenty of insight around teaching and practical techniques of classroom management. </p>
<p>Not only is the book $10 cheaper through the campaign, access to the book’s forum is half price and if we meet our initial stretch goal will be boosted an additional 6 months.</p> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584026426/xorfr4seonofpb1evde2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Getting the book printed is only the first step. I’m taking a huge financial risk of my own even if the project does not get funded. In order for it to succeed, I have to get out there and hit the road to show people how the methodology really improves the learning experience for the students and teachers.</p>
<p>I’ve got to hit trade shows, book speaking events, and still create workshops to help teacher-gamers really kickstart this program. </p>
<p><i><strong>Let’s keep it real:</strong></i> <u>this is an alternative learning method that requires adaptation</u>. There may be backlash as conventional school systems are entrenched in “standardization”. I have to keep pushing this body of work as a complement to curricula by expanding the resources for teachers. </p>
<p>Gamification has brought games into education, but have also made the teachers gatekeepers to the computer. The negative result is that kids will be on their best behavior just to be allowed to get on screen. We need to bring value back to the teacher-student relationship, also making the teacher-gamer an exciting part of education - off-screen!</p>

<p>And I am ready. The time is NOW. If not us, then who?</p>
<p>As a network of early adopters it is YOU that will help me carry this forward and YOU that by belief in this project, will help extend the reach of the Teacher-Gamer Revolution. </p>
<p>We have some goals to hit, and time is of the essence. There has been so much learned by going for it and I am so excited to turn this guerilla-style launch of getting the first Handbook off the ground and into teachers hands everywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will try to get questions answered as soon as possible, just know we are also trying to get the book to print BEFORE the end of the campaign and have a lot going on.</li>
<li>That being said, we are GOING TO PRINT and get your copies to you as SOON as possible. Depending on your location this could take some time as we are a GLOBAL movement with community around the world, but can only afford to print in ONE location at this time. </li>
<li>Print and delivery is scheduled for June 15th and getting copies in your hands by July 1st. But again, your patience is much appreciated and we will update you every step of the way!</li>

The Teacher-Gamer Handbook is a resource for educators to lead Role Playing Games (such as Dungeons and Dragons) in the classroom, in homeschool and online. It contains a full semester of robust lesson plans and the pedagogical infrastructure to last years that teach 36 life-skills to players with pre-created adventure suggestions, narrative arcs and prompts.

The main premise is: you can’t learn something unless you notice it. The purpose of the RPG Skillset is to generate multitudes of continuous opportunities to notice things within at least 36 major domains of self-development. The possibilities are endless.
My name is Zach.

1990’s adventuring in life, school, work, music production, becoming Canadian and starting a family steered me in new directions. 
2002+ raising two boys with my wife Sophie, I was teaching and studying by day, hangin' with the family and playing RPGs when I could on weekends.
2006 enrolled in an MA program in Education to better understand the “how” of teaching and learning.
2010 finished my Masters in Education focused on authentic learning and life-skills curriculum development.
2012 realized that role-playing games (RPGs) in Schools was an untapped resource. I began working on the Teacher-Gamer as an extension of my Distinct Self well-being program. 
2014-2016 brought RPGs in Schools curriculum into the classroom at Green School Bali
2015-present Wild Mind Training workshops blending RPGs in Schools with mindfulness ramps into wilderness trips with Wildlife Conservation Society.


2020 Teacher-Gamer Revolution! - happening offscreen on tabletops everywhere! Let’s get radical about balancing EdTech and AI coming into schools by bringing our teacher’s hobbies into life-skills classes that enrich youth with socio-emotional and literary skills while maintaining the distinctly human teacher-student relationships that cannot be replaced by computers.

What We Need & What You Get

I started this campaign for three main reasons:

It is time to put the Teacher-Gamer Revolution on the timeline, now, globally. It is so important to take what you have inside you and put it into the civic sphere. I urge all educators to make the world a better place by combining their passions with their pedagogical skills and make them available to the public.
Self-publishing the Teacher-Gamer Handbook (TGHB) will launch this new step of my career with all the support of my colleagues, friends and anyone who likes the idea that robust off-screen game-system-learning (engaging face-to-face life-skills development) is a viable initiative to balance the influx of technology into schools. 
The TGHB is my calling card, a beacon, an organized methodology that I can put into the hands of people I meet at conferences, conventions and school boards wherever I go.  

I took a calculated risk and have already borrowed the money to: 

finish the book 
have it typeset in the style of a role-playing game handbook 
make videos to explain how teaching RPGs in schools works
build a website with a private interactive forum. 

I also plan to use the momentum and connections I make with so many people around the world to take the curriculum to the next level.

My ultimate goal is to hit at least $60,000 so that I can spread the methodology online and hit the road when the world opens up again to safe conferences and in-person education.
Here's the Teacher-Gamer Revolution plan for the funds raised on IndieGoGo: 


Hard Copy prints of the book for everyone!
Hit our stretch goals and produce additional resources for Teacher-Gamers to accompany the Handbook.

Newsletters with practical activities
Instructional videos
Teacher-gamer website features celebrating educator success around the world  
Weekly Webinars for online outreach and support 
Teacher training workshop deployment to implement new full-scale RPGs in the classroom programs.
Head to Conferences and speaking events to grow the community and gain traction.
Continued customization of RPGs in Schools curriculum in community centers, school boards, correctional facilities and homeschools far and wide.


Finish the next three handbooks full of additional lesson plans, classroom activities and teaching strategies.


Benefits for the Educators

help schools transition into more life-skills programs that prepare youth for adulthood
build progressive opportunities for face-to-face off-screen courses in schools
maintain positive attitudes about the future of schools
work to make life-skills more prominent in schools for the subject teacher who is getting pushed out by tech 
Strengthen relationships with students through gameplay

The last thing a teacher wants to feel like is “obsolete”. There is some hustle each teacher must do to remain fresh, viable and relevant in their community, but if teachers are trying to battle incoming tech or are being asked to do more tech type roles, they will have to find ways to shift the consciousness of the institutes they work in or be moved around or pushed out. 
This is a call to teachers to take their passions- or at least an opportunity to pick up this methodology to teach games- and deploy life-skills into their learning environment.  

Stretch Goals

$25,000 - First Stretch Goal 
$35,000 - Second Stretch Goal (TBA)
$45,000 - Third Stretch Goal (TBA)
$55,000 - Fourth Stretch Goal (TBA)
$65,000 - Fifth Stretch Goal (TBA) <--- This is our ideal goal to hit and we have LOTS of goodies when we hit this level! This is the amount needed to really get this campaign rolling!
$80,000 - Sixth Stretch Goal (TBA)
The Impact

By contributing to the Teacher-Gamer Handbook, you are doing more than just buying a book or helping it get printed, you help:

establish the printing, distribution and sale of the book
the off-screen Teacher-Gamer Revolution gain traction and take flight
bring viability to the TEACHER-GAMER profession 
subject teachers to collaborate with their peers to build robust game systems into learning opportunities
wilderness survival teachers establish classroom simulations of safety and role-playing through authentic learning narratives
bring a whole new piece of curriculum to holistic education
make in-roads for RPGs in Schools to become a discipline unto itself that helps youth process the multiverse of systems, franchises, worlds and cultures that are coming at them at high-speed through the internet and media.

The Story

The Teacher-Gamer Handbook has been over 8 years in the making! 
The RPGs in Schools program was originally developed as an extension to a Personal and Social Development Local Programme course cycle in Canadian public school – a well-being curriculum program of life-skills electives at The English Montreal School Board in Quebec. Since then, the RPGs in Schools program has been adapted into the Wild Mind Training resiliency program for youth, 10 years old and older in schools and camps in Indonesia and the UK where I have been working over the last 6 years.

Starting in 2014, Green School Bali was an early adopter of the RPGs in Schools Program where I ran Introduction to Dungeons and Dragons as an English literacy course (creative writing) in high school and as an English literacy course (communication thematic) in middle school.
Every child surveyed in Green School reported that they liked the RPGs class and over half of them considered it their favorite class!
As I went along, I started realizing that all the life skills (21 basic and 15 advanced) that I was teaching could be dialed in to meet various curriculum goals and that if I put learners on a narrative cycle such as the Hero’s Journey, they would begin to recognize so many more thematics, symbols, motifs and literary forms as they relate to so many of the stories, books, films, TV series, mangas and other sagas that they follow.
Re-branded as Wild Mind Training, over the last 4 years. I have been experimenting with more mindfulness, wilderness conservation and improvisational theatre elements. As a home school aggregate on the weekdays and a weekend workshop for day school children, I have ironed out the kinks of three different levels of Introduction to Life-Skills through 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons courses. 
As with any pedagogy delivery system, the context and content (ie. role-playing game being used) can be adjusted into the area of study or subject. What matters most is that the learning system is authentically motivating and delivers opportunity after opportunity to acquire literacy, socio-emotional and life skills.   

When teacher-gamers, homeschool parents, mindfulness trainers, socio-emotional counselors and wilderness survival instructors get a hold of this book they will find it easy to use and with plenty of insight around teaching and practical techniques of classroom management. 
Not only is the book $10 cheaper through the campaign, access to the book’s forum is half price and if we meet our initial stretch goal will be boosted an additional 6 months. Risks & Challenges


Getting the book printed is only the first step. I’m taking a huge financial risk of my own even if the project does not get funded. In order for it to succeed, I have to get out there and hit the road to show people how the methodology really improves the learning experience for the students and teachers.
I’ve got to hit trade shows, book speaking events, and still create workshops to help teacher-gamers really kickstart this program. 
Let’s keep it real: this is an alternative learning method that requires adaptation. There may be backlash as conventional school systems are entrenched in “standardization”. I have to keep pushing this body of work as a complement to curricula by expanding the resources for teachers. 
Gamification has brought games into education, but have also made the teachers gatekeepers to the computer. The negative result is that kids will be on their best behavior just to be allowed to get on screen. We need to bring value back to the teacher-student relationship, also making the teacher-gamer an exciting part of education - off-screen!

The Teacher-Gamer Revolution is on!
And I am ready. The time is NOW. If not us, then who?
As a network of early adopters it is YOU that will help me carry this forward and YOU that by belief in this project, will help extend the reach of the Teacher-Gamer Revolution. 
We have some goals to hit, and time is of the essence. There has been so much learned by going for it and I am so excited to turn this guerilla-style launch of getting the first Handbook off the ground and into teachers hands everywhere.

We will try to get questions answered as soon as possible, just know we are also trying to get the book to print BEFORE the end of the campaign and have a lot going on.
That being said, we are GOING TO PRINT and get your copies to you as SOON as possible. Depending on your location this could take some time as we are a GLOBAL movement with community around the world, but can only afford to print in ONE location at this time. 
Print and delivery is scheduled for June 15th and getting copies in your hands by July 1st. But again, your patience is much appreciated and we will update you every step of the way!

Thanks to you for all your patience and getting involved.

There are several different ways to cleanse your card deck. One of those ways is with a crystal. Quartz crystal absorbs energy around it. So keeping your cards in the satin pouch with this crystal will help keep your deck clean! Quartz crystal helps with amplification therefore it will amplify the cleansing process. One of our favorite ways to do this is to place your quartz crystal on top of you deck, leave it outside in the sunlight for “sunnier” readings or bathe it in the moonlight to absorb the insightful and intuitive energies of the moon. Additionally, keeping your deck in a white satin bag also aids in the cleansing process. The color white has one of the highest vibrations and repeals darkness and negativity.

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>Afros and Audio was born out of a desire to amplify the voices, impact and visibility of Black and Afro Latinx podcast creators, and create opportunities for more original podcasts and industry careers in 2019 and beyond.</p>
<p>My name is Talib Jasir Fleming, a dual certified Life Coach to artists and entrepreneurs, author, fiction podcast creator and creative who envisions a world of community engagement, collaboration and creating opportunity for others.</p>
<p>Afros &amp; Audio Podcast Festival will work to bridge the information, access, and equity gap between Podcast Creators, Professionals and the Podcast industry. The aim of Afros &amp; Audio, LLC is to provide year round resources for Podcast Creators and Professionals of Color, including, but not limited to, sponsorship, podcast development and support for nonfiction and fiction shows, and professional services and careers.</p>
<p>Our two-day event promises to be a fun and inspiring weekend with informational workshops and breakout sessions, with topics to include content creation, editing, launching, marketing, etc., lively panels and discussions, as well as a commemorative keynote address.</p>
<p>When audio entertainment reigned, during the “Golden Age of Radio”, Black people were not invited or welcomed to the party. Afros and Audio wants to ensure that voices of Black and AfroLatinx people of all sexual and gender identities, nationalities, social and economic backgrounds, politics and faiths are given an opportunity to leave a legacy in the growing industry of podcasting. Our mission is to design lanes that intersect all spaces and opportunities within the Podcast Industry. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>Our campaign request is $50,000 (approximately 1/3 of what's needed):</p>
<p>In order to plan a two-day festival in Brooklyn, NY for attendees and participants to share in an experience that will create opportunity, provide resources for the sustainability of Podcast creators and professional services, and impact the quantity and visibility of active podcasts by Black and Afro-Latinx creators, we will need your support.  Your purchases will cover:</p>
<p>Equipment rental - Chairs, vendor tables, live streaming and replay equipment, stage, etc.</p>
<p>Event Team benefits - Afros &amp; Audio festival wouldn't be possible without the commitment and dedication of a few leaders who jumped in voluntarily. These folks deserve their travel and expenses paid and compensation for their hard work!</p>
<p>Venue Costs - BKLYN Studios placed us on their calendar because they believe in the vision and mission but most importantly want to host our inaugural event for the community and for the culture. The venue and location couldn't be more perfect for a summer weekend in downtown Brooklyn, NY. Check out the following links for more information about Afros &amp; Audio Podcast Festival's home, an insane food market, and hotels within walking distance for our traveling guests</p>
<p>Speaker Travel and Expenses - Our festival will propel us beyond the event into the next day and the day after; as Black creatives at the precipice of a renaissance in all forms, genres, and mediums. Our guest speakers and key note speaker were carefully selected to inspire and encourage us to keep up the good fight with our voices, creativity and ingenuity. Their time is valuable and we want to provide market value compensation for their travel, time and talent.</p>
<p>Pre, Day of, and Post-Production costs - Event Planner, DJ for the after party, security, audio/visual services, clean up, vendor fees, etc.</p>
<p><u><strong>Afros &amp; Audio perks</strong></u> include the following depending on level of contribution:</p>
<p>Streaming &amp; Replay Link for those who want to enjoy the weekend but can't attend in person</p>
<p>Exclusive Afros &amp; Audio Festival Merchandise</p>
<p>Early-Bird 2 Day General Admission Ticket</p>
<p>Early-Bird 2 Day VIP Admission Ticket (Includes After Party ticket)</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal - all funds will go to the festival costs, year round resources and podcast sponsorship. </p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Our Afros and Audio Inaugural Festival will create space and opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge and celebrate our contribution to the medium of podcasting</li>
<li>Provide the latest industry news, technology and information for podcast sustainability and success</li>
<li>Build a foundation of long-term strategy for collaboration and community patronage and support</li>
</ul>
<p>2018 Podcast stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple at WWDC confirmed over 550,000 active podcasts. (June, 2018)</li>
<li>FastCompany reported over 18.5 million episodes. (April, 2018)</li>
<li>Variety reported that Apple podcasts include content in more than 100 languages. (February, 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2019, less than 5% of active podcasts by and for people of the African Diaspora exist in the market. If this matters to you, than consider that percentage a Call to Action for creating and supporting podcasts by Black and Brown creators.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary:
Afros and Audio was born out of a desire to amplify the voices, impact and visibility of Black and Afro Latinx podcast creators, and create opportunities for more original podcasts and industry careers in 2019 and beyond.
My name is Talib Jasir Fleming, a dual certified Life Coach to artists and entrepreneurs, author, fiction podcast creator and creative who envisions a world of community engagement, collaboration and creating opportunity for others.
Afros & Audio Podcast Festival will work to bridge the information, access, and equity gap between Podcast Creators, Professionals and the Podcast industry. The aim of Afros & Audio, LLC is to provide year round resources for Podcast Creators and Professionals of Color, including, but not limited to, sponsorship, podcast development and support for nonfiction and fiction shows, and professional services and careers.
Our two-day event promises to be a fun and inspiring weekend with informational workshops and breakout sessions, with topics to include content creation, editing, launching, marketing, etc., lively panels and discussions, as well as a commemorative keynote address.
When audio entertainment reigned, during the “Golden Age of Radio”, Black people were not invited or welcomed to the party. Afros and Audio wants to ensure that voices of Black and AfroLatinx people of all sexual and gender identities, nationalities, social and economic backgrounds, politics and faiths are given an opportunity to leave a legacy in the growing industry of podcasting. Our mission is to design lanes that intersect all spaces and opportunities within the Podcast Industry. 
What We Need & What You Get:
Our campaign request is $50,000 (approximately 1/3 of what's needed):
In order to plan a two-day festival in Brooklyn, NY for attendees and participants to share in an experience that will create opportunity, provide resources for the sustainability of Podcast creators and professional services, and impact the quantity and visibility of active podcasts by Black and Afro-Latinx creators, we will need your support.  Your purchases will cover:
Equipment rental - Chairs, vendor tables, live streaming and replay equipment, stage, etc.
Event Team benefits - Afros & Audio festival wouldn't be possible without the commitment and dedication of a few leaders who jumped in voluntarily. These folks deserve their travel and expenses paid and compensation for their hard work!
Venue Costs - BKLYN Studios placed us on their calendar because they believe in the vision and mission but most importantly want to host our inaugural event for the community and for the culture. The venue and location couldn't be more perfect for a summer weekend in downtown Brooklyn, NY. Check out the following links for more information about Afros & Audio Podcast Festival's home, an insane food market, and hotels within walking distance for our traveling guests
Speaker Travel and Expenses - Our festival will propel us beyond the event into the next day and the day after; as Black creatives at the precipice of a renaissance in all forms, genres, and mediums. Our guest speakers and key note speaker were carefully selected to inspire and encourage us to keep up the good fight with our voices, creativity and ingenuity. Their time is valuable and we want to provide market value compensation for their travel, time and talent.
Pre, Day of, and Post-Production costs - Event Planner, DJ for the after party, security, audio/visual services, clean up, vendor fees, etc.
Afros & Audio perks include the following depending on level of contribution:
Streaming & Replay Link for those who want to enjoy the weekend but can't attend in person
Exclusive Afros & Audio Festival Merchandise
Early-Bird 2 Day General Admission Ticket
Early-Bird 2 Day VIP Admission Ticket (Includes After Party ticket)
Even if we don't reach our goal - all funds will go to the festival costs, year round resources and podcast sponsorship. 
The Impact:
Our Afros and Audio Inaugural Festival will create space and opportunity to:

Acknowledge and celebrate our contribution to the medium of podcasting
Provide the latest industry news, technology and information for podcast sustainability and success
Build a foundation of long-term strategy for collaboration and community patronage and support

2018 Podcast stats:

Apple at WWDC confirmed over 550,000 active podcasts. (June, 2018)
FastCompany reported over 18.5 million episodes. (April, 2018)
Variety reported that Apple podcasts include content in more than 100 languages. (February, 2018)

As of 2019, less than 5% of active podcasts by and for people of the African Diaspora exist in the market. If this matters to you, than consider that percentage a Call to Action for creating and supporting podcasts by Black and Brown creators.
We need your help to support Podcast Creators and Professionals of Color with sponsorship, year-round resources, such as, production, quality tech equipment and software, increase opportunities, promotion/marketing and more.
The Difference your Contribution will Make:
INFORMATION, RESOURCES, EQUITY & REPRESENTATION for existing podcast professionals, creators and those looking for solid direction for developing and launching their podcast ideas and services.
Opportunity for culturally relevant networking, skill building and entertainment. 
Special focus on expanding the reach of POC podcast creators with a unique platform that will shape, shift and uplift the narrative of our voices throughout the industry.
Provide access, platforms, and funding for advertising and marketing to push POC podcasts through the ranks of the hundreds of thousands of podcasts currently in market.
We are here to spread a message of community, collaboration, and a commitment to do both to the world. Everyone involved in AFROS & AUDIO is coming from a place of uplifting each other and the Black and Afro-Latinx podcast community!
Risks & Challenges:
Creating a festival of this scale and ambition includes a lot of hard work, insane optimism, and a commitment to our vision. Thankfully, we have a team of passionate podcast creators, enthusiasts and creative professionals who have been working in their chosen fields for years. YOUR support will create a funding cornerstone for our festival and beyond.

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where did HILLMAN THE GAME come from?</strong></h3>
<p>""A Different World"" premiered in the late 1980's as a spinoff to the iconic ""Cosby Show"".  It was the first show that depicted life at an HBCU.  Since its creation and completion, the shows positive impact on the Black/African-American community is undeniable.  Some even attribute their desire to attend and graduate college to the show - and that's including those who were born after the show stopped airing! </p>
<p>The show featured characters with extremely relatable situations and traits.  Characters like Denise Huxtable - the ambitious, unfocused and flighty middle child from a loving but demanding family; Kimberly Reese - the responsible, scholarly, workhorse with a rebellious spirit; Lena James - the intelligent, trendsetting, rough-around-the-edges hustler; and Mr. Gaines - the wise, crotchety, care-giver by way of food service with more advice than he had hair and many, many more are what made Hillman, albeit fiction, so real.  HILLMAN THE GAME had to happen.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a board game where you could act as characters that were iconic, inspirational and familiar to Black/African-American people came from the countless nostalgic conversations about the show.  Conversations that seemed to occur over and over regardless of location or venue.  Not to mention the severe lack of board games geared towards such a demographic so rich in culture, HILLMAN THE GAME was an easy choice to make when deciding which game a brand new table top board gaming company should make first.  </p>

<h3>Ten Years of Freak'n Game Making</h3>
<p>I have played games my whole life. A lot of games. I've played complete games of Risk, back-to-back-to-back with nothing but passion, warm Mountain Dew, and Dorrito crumbs as the only fuel to keep going. And that was before the age of 8. Seriously, what were my parent's thinking?</p>
<p>Like all avid gamers, I began to take note of what game mechanics really worked, and what didn't. As my life trajectory took me towards a career in the creative arts, it seemed natural to combine these two interests. The first thing I did was compile a list of the games I loved and what made them special. </p>

<h3>Okay, so where is this project at?</h3>
<p>The great news is, it's totally finished! </p>
<p>This isn't a project that I have a 'great' idea for and I just need money to complete it. It's ready for you to enjoy right now.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge, and it is huge, is the actual manufacturing of the game. It was a lucky mistake that I didn't know how costly chits, cards, and mats cost before I began, or else I would have ended up with a simpler version of Uno.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm hoping to raise 4300.00...give or take, that's about 60 games. I believe there is a critical mass threshold with games, where I'm hoping that it will be a big enough number and reach a broad enough audience to start gaining momentum through word of mouth. I fully understand that for this project to go anywhere, people who love games will need to share their experience with friends. And since I don't know all your awesome friends, I could never be as effective as all of us working together. There's no way I can do this alone and I am grateful for any supporter going on this journey with me. </p>
<p>Hitting the goal will also guarantee that I will finish the first expansion set. I want to keep on working on this project, making more cool cards, and adding some elements that I think will be so exciting. In fact, I can prove that right now...in the game you will receive chits that you wont be able to use in this version. There are several multi-colored tokens, steal tokens, and Furball Rampage tokens. These can be used with the expansion set, and will add even more deviousness and strategy. </p>
<p>Quite simply, the money from this campaign is going right back into this game so that you, the supporter, can get a copy within the next 4 months.</p>
<h2>STRETCH GOALS</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488333294/nycz7fva36vot25lrusi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>PERK ASSETS</h2>
<p>Okay, so you probably want to know what kind of cool stuff you'll be getting...well here it, our really cool tshirt design.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488177332/ec0djml4qmifojutqweu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h2>THERE'S MORE!! </h2>
</div><div>
<p>This has been a huge undertaking. In many ways it has been exhausting, but ultimately I'm excited that it can finally be shared. Along this journey I've created so many cards, and card types, but sadly, not all of them made starter set. The cards included in this game provide the best well-rounded experience, and an endless amount of variety. However, as of right now, I have at least 30 more cards that are really exciting. (I sort of mentioned this above) They are more intense, crazy, and cause a lot of havoc and destruction, and they are a perfect addition for everyone that has already learned the game, and they will definitely be included in the first expansion pack, 'The Lost Vault.' I'm sharing this because this not just some project I tinkered on in my spare time, but rather, it is something that I hope to keep doing for a long time to come. </p>
<p>For every supporter who purchases the Blast from the Past perk or higher, I will include an extra card that will never be given out again, nor will the card's special ability ever be used again...plus, the artwork is a good example of what you can expect in the The Lost Vault expansion set.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488175820/hucnl6uzxndtmfjmngto.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A successful campaign would be such a sweet reward to cap off a marathon of a project, and it would allow me to continue adding sweet new cards to the game! I really want to do this, I think you'll love it too! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>None!! That's the great part. There have been so many risks and challenges along the way. Honestly, it would take too long to mention the personal financing I contributed, the insane amount of personal time, the frustrations, the learning curve, etc. </p>
<p>That's all behind me now. I want to give you this game, and I hope that you love it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone is in a place to get this game right now. That's totally okay! If you know anyone who loves games, point them this direction. I really believe that game players will see the work that went in to Furball Rampage and will love mechanics as much as I do.</p>

Right now, I'm hoping to raise 4300.00...give or take, that's about 60 games. I believe there is a critical mass threshold with games, where I'm hoping that it will be a big enough number and reach a broad enough audience to start gaining momentum through word of mouth. I fully understand that for this project to go anywhere, people who love games will need to share their experience with friends. And since I don't know all your awesome friends, I could never be as effective as all of us working together. There's no way I can do this alone and I am grateful for any supporter going on this journey with me. 
Hitting the goal will also guarantee that I will finish the first expansion set. I want to keep on working on this project, making more cool cards, and adding some elements that I think will be so exciting. In fact, I can prove that right now...in the game you will receive chits that you wont be able to use in this version. There are several multi-colored tokens, steal tokens, and Furball Rampage tokens. These can be used with the expansion set, and will add even more deviousness and strategy. 
Quite simply, the money from this campaign is going right back into this game so that you, the supporter, can get a copy within the next 4 months.
STRETCH GOALS

PERK ASSETS
Okay, so you probably want to know what kind of cool stuff you'll be getting...well here it, our really cool tshirt design.


THERE'S MORE!! 

This has been a huge undertaking. In many ways it has been exhausting, but ultimately I'm excited that it can finally be shared. Along this journey I've created so many cards, and card types, but sadly, not all of them made starter set. The cards included in this game provide the best well-rounded experience, and an endless amount of variety. However, as of right now, I have at least 30 more cards that are really exciting. (I sort of mentioned this above) They are more intense, crazy, and cause a lot of havoc and destruction, and they are a perfect addition for everyone that has already learned the game, and they will definitely be included in the first expansion pack, 'The Lost Vault.' I'm sharing this because this not just some project I tinkered on in my spare time, but rather, it is something that I hope to keep doing for a long time to come. 
For every supporter who purchases the Blast from the Past perk or higher, I will include an extra card that will never be given out again, nor will the card's special ability ever be used again...plus, the artwork is a good example of what you can expect in the The Lost Vault expansion set.

A successful campaign would be such a sweet reward to cap off a marathon of a project, and it would allow me to continue adding sweet new cards to the game! I really want to do this, I think you'll love it too! 

Risks & Challenges
None!! That's the great part. There have been so many risks and challenges along the way. Honestly, it would take too long to mention the personal financing I contributed, the insane amount of personal time, the frustrations, the learning curve, etc. 
That's all behind me now. I want to give you this game, and I hope that you love it.

Other Ways You Can Help
I know that not everyone is in a place to get this game right now. That's totally okay! If you know anyone who loves games, point them this direction. I really believe that game players will see the work that went in to Furball Rampage and will love mechanics as much as I do.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This Project is a follow up to the Kickstarter campaign, we had a couple dice sets that didn't unlock that we wanted a second chance to have created.</p>
<p>The Story began with about dragons, adventure, friendship and love. Moonie's adventures were tales written for my son, and this project began with the desire to create a visual element for him. </p>
<p>Working with Canadian artist, Amanda Busby, concept art of each of the dragons were produced.  This Kickstarter was created out of my passion for dice and my deep love for these stories. The dice were created with each dragon in mind, taking elements of their designs, personalities, and my own personal feelings on what represents them. The results are the stunning dice sets you see photographed below! You may even recognize a few of the dragons from my past Kickstarters.</p>
<p>This is a Canadian Project, each of the rewards will list the approximate conversion to some of the major currencies.  </p>

<p>SteaMage ist ein Pen &amp; Paper Rollenspiel, in dem in einer Welt voller Magie die industrielle Revolution beginnt. Dieses Fantasy/Steampunk Crossover bietet neben einer detailreich ausgearbeiteten Welt auch mehrere, spielbare Fantasy Rassen.</p>
<p>Diese Rassen umfassen Menschen, Waldelfen, die nomadischen Wüstenelfen, Zwerge und sogenannte Chimären, Mischwesen aus Mensch und Tier.</p>
<p>Aus einem Baukastensystem kann sich jeder Spieler seine eigenen Zauber erstellen und seine eigenen Geräte und Technologien entwickeln. Zur Inspiration sind einige Beispielzauber und Beispieltechnologien vorhanden.</p>
<p>SteaMage wird  seit 2012 von den Freunden und ehemaligen Studienkollegen Tobias und Christopher entwickelt. Im Frühjahr 2019 kam mit dem Neuzugang des Teams bestehend aus Illustrator, Setzerin und Lektorin neuer Wind in die Segel.</p>
<p>Das selbstentwickelte Regelsystem ist einfach und intuitiv, gut geeignet für Einsteiger und erfahrene Rollenspieler gleichermaßen. Mathemagie hat im Voraus dafür gesorgt, dass es für alle fair ist.</p>

<p>SteaMage spielt in einer Welt, die vom Europa des viktorianischen Zeitalters inspiriert ist, doch Ländernamen und Landesgrenzen sind stark verschieden. Ein weiterer Punkt, in dem sich die Welt von SteaMage von der realen Welt abhebt, ist die Existenz von uralter Magie, die die Gesellschaft schon immer durchdringt. Prinzipiell kann jeder das Zaubern erlernen, doch es erfordert viel Willenskraft, genauso wie jeder sich technischen Wissen aneignen kann, wenn er den nötigen Zugang zu Bildung besitzt. Zauber sind flüchtiger Natur, während Technologie kostspielige Einzelteile benötigt. Die industrielle Revolution, die in vollem Gange ist, vereinfacht den Alltag der Menschen und bringt Fortschritt, den jeder nutzen kann und der dauerhaft besteht. Magie und Technik stehen allerdings im Gegensatz - sie stören sich gegenseitig und nicht nur das Zaubern in Zügen oder Fabrikdistrikten ist schwierig und oft auch untersagt sondern Revolver und Dampfmaschinen haben in der Nähe von alten Wäldern und Magierakademien häufig Fehlfunktionen. Dieser Konflikt spiegelt sich auch in der Gesellschaft wider und Magier und Ingenieure liegen sich oft in den Haaren.</p>
<p>Die Existenz von Magie hat ebenfalls dazu geführt, dass es mehr als eine humanoide Rasse gibt, die sich zu einer Zivilisation weiter entwickelt hat: Neben dem Menschen, die den Großteil der Bevölkerung ausmachen, stammen Waldelfen aus Éire, Wüstenelfen aus Osmanien und Zwerge lebten ursprünglich unter Tage in den Alpen und anderen Gebirgen Zentraleuropas. Es existieren außerdem Chimären, Mischwesen aus Mensch und Tier, die als Helfer von slawischen Schwarzmagiern erschaffen wurden. Später wurde diese Praktik in anderen Ländern übernommen, so dass eine Vielzahl von Chimären entstanden sind. Manche von ihnen konnten sich fortpflanzen und es ist nicht selten, dass sie in abgelegenen Wäldern oder in den Slums verschiedener Städte frei geboren werden. Egal welcher Herkunft, Chimären haben einen niedrigen sozialen Status und es wird von der Gesellschaft in der Regel auf sie herabgesehen, was eine zusätzliche rollenspielerische Herausforderung darstellt.</p>

<p>Jede der 34 Fertigkeiten gehört zu einem von sechs primären Attributen. Diese sind Kraft, Ausdauer, Geschick, Bildung, Charisma und Wille. Für jeden Punkt im primären Attribut erhält ein Spieler einen sechsseitigen Würfel zum Werfen. Für jeden Punkt, den ein Charakter auf eine Fertigkeit besitzt, kann einer der sechsseitigen durch einen achtseitigen Würfel ausgetauscht werden. Gute oder schlechte Ausrüstung, Spezialisierungen, Zeitdruck oder Lichtverhältnisse sorgen dafür, dass weitere Würfel ausgetauscht werden dürfen. So kann ein Spieler auch zwölfseitige Würfel in seinem Pool erhalten, aber auch seine achtseitigen wieder durch sechseitige austauschen müssen. Mit dem Würfelpool muss der Spieler dann gleich oder höher einer vom Spielleiter gesetzten Schwelle würfeln, um eine Probe zu bestehen.</p>

<p>In SteaMage gibt es neben den vorgefertigten Beispielzaubern auch die Möglichkeit, sich seine eigenen Zauber zu entwickeln. Das gleiche gilt ebenfalls für Technologien: Es sind einige Beispielgeräte beschrieben, doch ein großer Punkt in SteaMage ist es, sich diese Technologien zu eigen zu machen, indem man sie modifiziert oder selber neue erfindet. Dazu stellen wir ein Baukastensystem zur Verfügung, aus dem die gewünschten Effekte herausgenommen werden und in einen Zauber oder ein Gerät eingefügt werden können. Der einzig limitierende Faktor sind Zeit und Erschöpfung, denn Zauber oder Technologien zu entwickeln ist sehr anstrengend. Da SteaMage in einem Fantasy und Steampunk Setting spielt, sind Erfindungen außerdem nicht an reale Physik gebunden und fliegende Städte sind ebenso denkbar wie dampfbetriebene Laufmaschinen.</p>

In partnership with my good old friend Patrick Moraras, fellow game designer and a passionate wood craftsman, I'm here today to present  a Four Walls, a board game that's Fun, Fast and Easy for all ages and for your family too.</p>
<p>This campaign is a vital milestone for us. It's our first venture into the world of board games where we intend to make a long career. Here where we can apply our knowledge of 20+ years in the video game industry.</p>
<p>Both Patrick and I have baby daughters. It was our life long dream to create a positive game, that can bring families and friends together, to foster this amazing feeling of warmth and fun with the dear ones. We wanted to design a game that is eco-friendly and safe for kids, as well as uses recyclable materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Support Four Walls?</strong></p>
<p>Four Walls is a game like you never had before. A handcrafted wooden board game, a pleasure to play with, where you practically adjust your strategy after each roll of the dice. It was played and tested with our friends, kids and families (no joke!) while enjoying every moment. We tweaked the game until it was perfected and the rules were set in stone. This means that we have the game ready to be manufactured. It's done. No more development.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are very excited to publish our first board game. If we get funded, it will help us start prototyping new board games that we have in store and to share our experiences with other people who want to create games. And last, but not least, this will help us produce Four Walls in as many copies as possible for all those who have faith in us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get is the Real Thing.</strong></p>
<p>Funding Four Walls offers great value over money. Each time you play, there is a new situation you need to adapt your strategy to. Chance and Strategy go hand in hand and highlight one another. That's re-playability at its best. And when playing in 4 we guarantee that decisions will make you sweat, as 4 players need to find ways to cooperate between themselves while also  playing their individual best.</p>
<p>When you invest your money behind Four Walls you actually invest your faith in our 20+ years experience in video games design.</p>

<p><br/><strong>We are Martin Neill (bring it back guy / football game nerd), Alan Stewart (board game guru), Giles Hunter (games publisher of over 200 titles including the original Brian Clough's Football Fortunes) and David Hall (originator and creator of Brian Clough's Football Fortunes.)</strong></p>
<p>In 2017 we got together to discuss the possibility of a new, modernised version of what was Marty's favourite childhood game. By 2018 we had a community of<strong> over 5000 people on Facebook</strong> excited at the prospect and by mid August we'd <strong>closed a £20,000 crowdfunding campaign</strong> that will allow us to make the new game. </p>
<p><font>Beyond the Kickstarter we've had a number of people asking how they can get the game and so we're here on IndieGoGo Indemand to allow those who missed out to get in on the game! We're also continuing the ability to have a <strong>Personalised Coach Card</strong> in the game with the backer's name (or a name of their choosing) printed on it. This was hugely popular last time around and so there's <strong>only a further 15 available this time around!</strong></font><br/> </p>

<h3>How To Play Football Fortunes<br/> </h3>
<p>As the manager of your chosen club you're responsible for everything from player recruitment to managing staff, from formations to finances as well as managing the various crises the game can throw at you. <strong>The board game part of Football Fortunes is where you buy, sell, transfer and loan players as well as get sponsorship, visit your academy, hire staff and much much more.</strong> The computer app part takes care of all of the messy stuff from working out the match fixtures and results to totting up the league tables and even rolling the dice for you.    </p>
<p>Watch our video below for a run through of how to play the new Football Fortunes game. From signing players, to transfer windows, how to use the Coach card and Scout card, what are Manager's Luck and Selection Problems cards and much more. <br/> </p>

<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mvzne3SMIis?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><br/> </div>
<p>If that's not enough we have a full two season playthrough of our latest prototype of the game available to watch below. <strong>This video has it all</strong> from the board to the how the app is used, to formations, tactics, strategies and what amazing things can happen if you pray to Bob (who might be Bob Bolder and if you know who he was you're likely a fan of the original game!)</p>
</div><div>
<p>We're joined by Rory Kelly our agent and Nick Hamilton who's coding the new app for a full two season playthrough of the game. If you have questions please get in touch in the comments but <strong>almost everything that can happen in the game is in the video below.</strong></p>
<p>Worth noting also that neither Nick nor Rory had played the game before...<br/> </p>

<p>We've been playing Football Fortunes for over thirty years and it has never got old in all of that time. From being kids, to teenagers and eventually (sort of!) adults we've always found something to love in the game and hope that the new game can build on the genius of the original and bring joy to a whole new generation of gamers. After all football is simple really, it's people together. <br/> </p>
</div>
<h3>Why Football Fortunes? What's different?<br/> </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566131660/vzrjhtwp6u69k4qxlb0y.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>From the groundbreaking 1982 classic Kevin Tom’s Football Manager to modern day Football Manager football management games have always been long, lonely affairs right? </strong></p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p><strong>Brian Clough’s Football Fortunes tore up the rulebook </strong>in the mid 80s by uniquely combining the best elements of board games with a computer programme. For football gaming fans, the game had it all. Not only did you have the highs and lows of managing your favourite football club but you could crush your mates on the way to winning the Cup, buy their favourite player from under their nose or even lead Luton Town to unlikely European glory all without leaving your living room! </p>
<p>In the 32 years since Brian Clough’s Football Fortunes was released a lot has changed. Hairlines, waistlines, technology, the world itself and most definitely football. From transfer windows to Super Sundays, bungs to Bosmans, the Premier League itself and the Champions League the landscape has changed a lot. Not least the obscene amounts of money and of course, not least, the players themselves. </p>
<p><strong>Football Fortunes 2019 brings football management gaming into the social setting once more </strong>with modern football rules and players, for football fans of all ages. The game emulates the highs and lows of football management, with managers having to out-think and out manoeuvre their opponents to win. Choose from multiple strategies. React best to a crisis. Stave off bankruptcy. Sign the best players. The skillset required to succeed will be varied and the hurdles challenging, just like they are in the real world!</p>
<h3>Building a Dream Team</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566131905/acepltt1e7xn9bxmuhmu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Fast forward nearly thirty years and I found myself picking up a copy of Cloughies on eBay. When it arrived it was in mint condition. <strong>I loved every second of carefully tearing the player cards,</strong> reading through the rules and messaging my now 40 something mates to see if they fancied a game.</p>
<p>We played it and it had lost none of its sparkle. Watching my mates transfixed by the old school vidiprinter, celebrating wildly when they won a trophy and bantering each other to within an inch of their lives <strong>I knew I had to try to bring the game back.</strong></p>
<p>I started a Facebook page and within a month it had more than 1000 fans all talking about the original game and asking questions about the remake. One of the guys on the page said that he could introduce me to the guy who published Cloughies. And so he did!</p>
<p><strong>Giles Hunter is the former owner of CDS Software</strong> and the publisher of Brian Clough’s Football Fortunes among many other hugely successful game titles such as Colossus Chess and Steve Davis Snooker. Giles was hugely receptive to the idea of creating a modern version of Cloughies and <strong>better still he was still good friends with David Hall the creator and visionary behind the original game. </strong></p>
<p>I made the hop over from Belfast to Donny, as Giles and David call Doncaster, on a hot day in the summer of 2017 with a bunch of ideas under my arm. The guys waxed lyrical about Cloughies, telling the tales of how it came to be, swerving responsibility for the legendary Liverpool striker John Aldridge being a 1 star player in the game (I’m gonna fix that some day) and much more, including how <strong>the original game had sold nearly 200,000 copies from England to Australia.</strong></p>
<p>We agreed that bringing it back with a modernised version sounded like a great idea and set to work.</p>
<p>Nearly two years on and the game is now becoming a reality once more!<br/> </p>

<p><br/><strong>We did over 400 public player votes on our Facebook page</strong>, asking our community to rate Premier League players from 1-5 stars based on their ability. We had some great fun as fans of rival teams tried to vote down players from teams they didn't like but overall we got a very balanced set of players. From the obvious 5 stars like Mo Salah and Sergio Aguero to the barrel scrapers like Saido Berahino and Vincent Janssen at the other end of the talent spectrum, the ratings were pretty much what we'd expected. </p>
<p>Then we removed one star players after a number of play tests, they were simply frustrating in transfer windows and auctions and annoying to get rid of from manager's squads as no one wanted to buy them. In the end we decided to take them out of the game altogether, <strong>introducing Youth Players instead</strong> which has been a great success we're pleased to say!<br/> </p>

<p>The game starts, like the real world, with a <strong>summer transfer window allowing managers to bid on the next player cards in the deck with the highest bidder winning. </strong>Players are split into two types; Professionals and Youth Players. Professional players are rated from 2-5 stars depending on their ability while Youth Players begin with no rating and are coached to become star players. </p>
<p>All managers will begin the game with a 12 star defence (goalkeeper + defenders) and a 12 star attack (midfielders + attackers) and with two unrated Youth Players on the bench who can be upgraded as the game progresses. <strong>Players can be bought in free agent auctions </strong>throughout the game, can be acquired via luck cards from Selection Problems and Managers Luck, can be Bosman Free Transfers or even bought from other managers as each manager has a transfer and loan list. </p>
<p><strong>Youth Players are brand new in the new game</strong> and replace the Utility Players from the original. Youth Players can be recruited by hiring a Scout, a visit to your Academy or via luck cards. They can be upgraded throughout the game, using the Coach.</p>
<p>Each player starts the game with a 1 star Coach. <strong>The coach can be upgraded</strong> as the game progresses either via landing on the Manage Staff square or via certain cards that can be drawn by landing on Manager's Luck for example. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566132924/horbfl37jt1yqktg0qgj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Coach is a very important addition to the new game</strong> in that his rating (from 1 to 5 stars) gets added to the overall team rating for matches as well as being the amount that Youth Players can be upgraded when the opportunity arises to do so. So if for example you have a 3 star Coach and you have the chance to upgrade a Youth Player he can be upgraded by 3 stars, for a fee of course of £20m per star.<br/> </p>
<h3>Master Tactics and Strategy<br/> </h3>
<p>Managers must choose their players (usually by the highest rated in each position), <strong>their team's formation from 7 different formations</strong> and how to play either defensively or in an attacking style.  </p>
<p>A typical team layout in a 4-4-3 formation</p>
<p>If for example you choose to <strong>'do a Mourinho'</strong> and park the bus in a defensive strategy you could set up with 6 defenders (in a 5-3-2 formation) and add your Coach to your defence to make a very solid defence likely at the expense of a weaker attack unless you have a very strong squad.</p>
<p>Conversely you could play an uber attacking formation of 4-2-4 for example and add your Coach's rating to your attack hoping that your goals scored outweigh the goals you might ship at the back.  <strong>The stronger your playing squad the greater chance you have of course of successfully using different tactics to win matches. </strong>And if you want to win the big trophies you'll need it a big and talented squad, just like the real world!</p>
<p>The new Football Fortunes game offers multiple strategies and ways to win however of course each strategy has its risks! <strong>Run out of money and you're out of the game</strong>, and there are only a limited amount of Youth Players available meaning other managers can block you from buying them. In reality, just like the real world, the best managers will be able to balance a mix of seasoned pros and youth all the way to phenomenal success. </p>
<p>Will you try a <strong>Man City or Chelsea style moneybags approach</strong> and buy everyone in sight, a L<strong>iverpool style Moneyball philosophy</strong> where you sell big players and reinvest wisely or try to raise a team of superstars from the youth ranks like <strong>Manchester United’s famous Class of 92? </strong></p>
<p>All of these approaches are possible and all are up to you! And you get to beat your friends and family on the way to glory too, which is the real win!</p>

</div></div>","We are Martin Neill (bring it back guy / football game nerd), Alan Stewart (board game guru), Giles Hunter (games publisher of over 200 titles including the original Brian Clough's Football Fortunes) and David Hall (originator and creator of Brian Clough's Football Fortunes.)
In 2017 we got together to discuss the possibility of a new, modernised version of what was Marty's favourite childhood game. By 2018 we had a community of over 5000 people on Facebook excited at the prospect and by mid August we'd closed a £20,000 crowdfunding campaign that will allow us to make the new game. 
Beyond the Kickstarter we've had a number of people asking how they can get the game and so we're here on IndieGoGo Indemand to allow those who missed out to get in on the game! We're also continuing the ability to have a Personalised Coach Card in the game with the backer's name (or a name of their choosing) printed on it. This was hugely popular last time around and so there's only a further 15 available this time around! 

How To Play Football Fortunes 
As the manager of your chosen club you're responsible for everything from player recruitment to managing staff, from formations to finances as well as managing the various crises the game can throw at you. The board game part of Football Fortunes is where you buy, sell, transfer and loan players as well as get sponsorship, visit your academy, hire staff and much much more. The computer app part takes care of all of the messy stuff from working out the match fixtures and results to totting up the league tables and even rolling the dice for you.    
Watch our video below for a run through of how to play the new Football Fortunes game. From signing players, to transfer windows, how to use the Coach card and Scout card, what are Manager's Luck and Selection Problems cards and much more.  

 
If that's not enough we have a full two season playthrough of our latest prototype of the game available to watch below. This video has it all from the board to the how the app is used, to formations, tactics, strategies and what amazing things can happen if you pray to Bob (who might be Bob Bolder and if you know who he was you're likely a fan of the original game!)

We're joined by Rory Kelly our agent and Nick Hamilton who's coding the new app for a full two season playthrough of the game. If you have questions please get in touch in the comments but almost everything that can happen in the game is in the video below.
Worth noting also that neither Nick nor Rory had played the game before... 


 
We've been playing Football Fortunes for over thirty years and it has never got old in all of that time. From being kids, to teenagers and eventually (sort of!) adults we've always found something to love in the game and hope that the new game can build on the genius of the original and bring joy to a whole new generation of gamers. After all football is simple really, it's people together.  

Why Football Fortunes? What's different? 
 
From the groundbreaking 1982 classic Kevin Tom’s Football Manager to modern day Football Manager football management games have always been long, lonely affairs right? 
Wrong!
Brian Clough’s Football Fortunes tore up the rulebook in the mid 80s by uniquely combining the best elements of board games with a computer programme. For football gaming fans, the game had it all. Not only did you have the highs and lows of managing your favourite football club but you could crush your mates on the way to winning the Cup, buy their favourite player from under their nose or even lead Luton Town to unlikely European glory all without leaving your living room! 
In the 32 years since Brian Clough’s Football Fortunes was released a lot has changed. Hairlines, waistlines, technology, the world itself and most definitely football. From transfer windows to Super Sundays, bungs to Bosmans, the Premier League itself and the Champions League the landscape has changed a lot. Not least the obscene amounts of money and of course, not least, the players themselves. 
Football Fortunes 2019 brings football management gaming into the social setting once more with modern football rules and players, for football fans of all ages. The game emulates the highs and lows of football management, with managers having to out-think and out manoeuvre their opponents to win. Choose from multiple strategies. React best to a crisis. Stave off bankruptcy. Sign the best players. The skillset required to succeed will be varied and the hurdles challenging, just like they are in the real world!
Building a Dream Team

Fast forward nearly thirty years and I found myself picking up a copy of Cloughies on eBay. When it arrived it was in mint condition. I loved every second of carefully tearing the player cards, reading through the rules and messaging my now 40 something mates to see if they fancied a game.
We played it and it had lost none of its sparkle. Watching my mates transfixed by the old school vidiprinter, celebrating wildly when they won a trophy and bantering each other to within an inch of their lives I knew I had to try to bring the game back.
I started a Facebook page and within a month it had more than 1000 fans all talking about the original game and asking questions about the remake. One of the guys on the page said that he could introduce me to the guy who published Cloughies. And so he did!
Giles Hunter is the former owner of CDS Software and the publisher of Brian Clough’s Football Fortunes among many other hugely successful game titles such as Colossus Chess and Steve Davis Snooker. Giles was hugely receptive to the idea of creating a modern version of Cloughies and better still he was still good friends with David Hall the creator and visionary behind the original game. 
I made the hop over from Belfast to Donny, as Giles and David call Doncaster, on a hot day in the summer of 2017 with a bunch of ideas under my arm. The guys waxed lyrical about Cloughies, telling the tales of how it came to be, swerving responsibility for the legendary Liverpool striker John Aldridge being a 1 star player in the game (I’m gonna fix that some day) and much more, including how the original game had sold nearly 200,000 copies from England to Australia.
We agreed that bringing it back with a modernised version sounded like a great idea and set to work.
Nearly two years on and the game is now becoming a reality once more!

In the end we decided to take them out of the game altogether, introducing Youth Players instead which has been a great success we're pleased to say!

Lost one of the needed dice? Annoyed at dice dropping off a table? Tired of summing up the value of several dice? Have physical difficulty rolling normal dice?  U-DICE  Introducing U-Dice, an universal electronic dice for most dice games. It could have up to 6 dice at one roll, with each die be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,12, 20, 24, 30 or 100 faces.                                                                              
                                                  Push, tap or shake to roll U-DICE
U-DICE has 6 sets of the following dice:


The d10 die has the value from 1 to 10. The percentile die (d%) has the value from 1 to 100, so there is no need for two dice with one represents units and the other tens. The fudge die has the value of -1, 0, 1, and is listed as (F3) to distinguish it from normal d3 which is listed as (3).  Select the dice
There are 2 buttons on the back of the U-Dice for selecting how many dice (1 ~ 6) you need and the sides for each die (d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d24, d30, d%, fudge d3).
                                                                                              Preset set screen
Each dice setting is saved to one preset. There are up to 5 presets available for you to save. Every time when you make a dice setting and save it to one preset, that preset becomes the current preset.
                                                               Change to preset 1 (3d6) with one button press
During game, you could easily press the Preset Selection button once to change to the next preset, or press it several times to change to other available presets. If there are only 2 saved presets, you could toggle between these 2 presets by only one button press. 
Roll the dice
U-DICE uses a sensitive vibration sensor, so you could easily push, tap or shake it to roll the dice, the rolling screen will be displayed for 1 second followed by the roll result.
                                                                                    Push, tap, or shake to roll U-DICE
Roll result

                                                            Roll result screen
When U-DICE is set to 1d6, 2d6, or 3d6, the d6 die is displayed with pips instead of number.
For all other cases, each die will be displayed with its roll value inside its die box, while the die sides is displayed to the lower left corner of the die box. 
The total value of all the dice except percentile dice is displayed on the top for easy recognition. 
If more than 1 percentile dice are set, only the first one is displayed on the top.
Specifications



Perks






Stretch goals






When U-DICE is powered on, a startup screen with the U-DICE logo is displayed for 1 second. For personal edition, your personal message will be displayed under the U-DICE logo on that screen, such as ""Special for <your name>"", etc. If this stretch goal is unlocked, you could specify your own message in the survey after the campaign ends.



The default black panel for the U-DICE display could be replaced easily with other panels. If this stretch goal is unlocked, you do not select only one color, you get all the colors! That means you will have all the 8 beautiful color panels for your U-DICE, change it whenever you want. 




Every U-DICE will have a sweet home.

<p>This Mega Adventure includes a booklet of spell traps which can be incorporated into your own campaign adventures. Further, the included novella gives a 77W look at a band of adventurers as they navigate this very dungeon. The added value is another nod to old school works.</p>
<p>This adventure is designed to be challenging. The dungeon is ancient, partially rebuilt, repurposed through the ages, but now holds ties to an ancient desert goddess, ambitious mages, remnant magic from past and powerful illusionists, and areas of mystery.

If the Elevator gets too heavy, it breaks and everyone loses. If the Elevator reaches the 20th floor without breaking, everyone wins! Monsters in the Elevator is for 2-6 player, ages 7-to-11 (and up). It takes 2 minutes to learn and 5-20 minutes to play.There are two decks: The Draw and the Floors. The Draw deck contains Monsters with weight numbers on their bodies.Each Floor of the Elevator is a new round of the game, where players check the new Floor card and the Monster cards in the Elevator to see if any of those Monsters exit (get discarded).Then the players each enter a Monster card from their hand into the Elevator at the same time...     and finally they add up the weights of the Monsters in the Elevator. If the sum is above the Elevator Capacity (50 x the number of players), the Elevator crashes and everyone loses.    Otherwise, everyone is dealt a new card and play continues to the next Floor. All the players win if the Elevator makes it safely to the 20th floor!    There are also Actions in the Draw deck that you can choose to play instead of a Monster, including cards that Change the Floor up or down, cards that make one Monster Exit to Get Exercise or take a Phone Call, or cards that completely clear the Elevator with Giant Bees or a Fire Alarm. Families can decide how much they want to keep their hand secret and how much they want to share for easier cooperation.Finally, in the Advanced Mode the Floors are shuffled and played face-down, and without knowing what Floor might show up next, the likelihood of crashing goes up and the game gets much more intense with every round.WHAT IS IN THE BOX? The standard deck contains 96 cards: 20 Floors, 64 Monsters, and 12 Actions (4 All Monster Exits, 4 Single Monster Exits, 3 Change the Floor, and 1 Swap a Monster).  A new card is being added for this Indiegogo with every 100 new contributors-- check out the updates!My name is Jason Wiser. I teach Art, Animation, and Game Design at Harvard, Tufts, Emerson, and Northeastern Universities. I used to work in console games, but now I make games for my daughter, Yaela, and she loves to share them with others! When she started to enjoy math, I designed Monsters in the Elevator with Yaela to help her build math confidence and to learn and practice important skills like estimation and arithmetic. Yaela has been playtesting my games for years, and she was very excited to be involved in this project. She named many of the monsters, decided which art should go with which weight, and created the Advanced Play mode by suggesting we mix up the Floors to remove the carefully crafted pacing, and place the Floors face-down to remove the ability to plan for the next Floor, creating far more intense gameplay experiences!We have playtested the game for many months and found kids love the cute Monsters and the excitement of trying to survive each round.  Parents love watching their kids get into the calculations to see if the weight is too much on each Floor, and to measure the impact of their choices throughout the game.We have a fantastic support team of three senior students from The New England Institute of Art: Madeleine Bracket, Jeannie Holmes, and Anna Giannuzzi, who are helping us run demos, design marketing materials, and generally saving the day behind the scenes.  It has been so exciting watching kids get thoroughly engrossed in the math of this game. We want to get Monsters in the Elevator into as many homes, schools, and libraries as we can.We are trying to hit a funding goal of at least $2,500 to meet minimum quantities for quality manufacturing and the production of new cards.​ For every 100 people who donate at any level, we will add a new card to everyone’s deck! For every 50 copies of the game claimed through this campaign we will donate a copy to a library or a school. Help us bring this game to more kids!We are so excited to be 1 of 5 Finalists in the Hasbro Gaming Lab family game challenge! We need at least 100 different backers to qualify to win, and then the judges will decide (including Shark Tank Judge Daymond John!) . 
The main Perk is the game, but given the enthusiasm we have seen for the character designs I am offering stickers and stuffed monsters as well. I love teaching game art and design to students of all ages, so you can expect some Perks about opportunities for art and game development lessons with me.
Those who contribute will have access to contests during the campaign!
Even if we do not meet our goal, anyone who contributes will get their Perks.

""Monsters in the Elevator is a fantastic little cooperative card game with a real kid-friendly sense of humor. This game packs some nice strategic and educational concepts into a quick, cute and light package. Since you can teach the rules in a matter of a few seconds, I’d highly recommend this game to a family of young gamers."" GeekDad:

The first player to pass in the Auction Phase will be the last player to choose an Item Card during the Curation Phase. The second player to pass will be the second last to choose a card, and so forth. After declaring a pass, the player will take a numbered Priority Token to keep track of their Priority order.</p><p>The Auction Phase ends when all players but one have passed (the last person standing, so to speak). All money cards spent on bids are then removed from play; none of them are returned to the players after an auction. So when a player decides to make a bid, they better mean it!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525623965/pxawoftwymm7g4fx5uyg.png"" src=""""/></p><p>During the Curation Phase, each player will take a turn choosing an Item Card from the Market in order of highest Priority determined during the Auction Phase.

Item Cards are never placed above, below or on top of other cards in the Cabinet (except for one special case, described later).

Players increase the value of their Cabinet by 'curating': arranging items so that one is thematically linked to another, creating an aesthetic cohesion to the collection. At the end of the last round, the player whose Cabinet is worth the most wins! 3-5 players , 15 to 25 minutes to play.'Wunderkammer' is a German word that translates as ""chamber of wonders"". The closest English term would be 'Cabinet of Curiosities'. A Wunderkammer is a space, typically a cabinet, where collections of strange, rare, exotic and ingeniously crafted objects are organised and exhibited.  This style of collecting has a very long history, going back hundreds of years to the time of the Renaissance. Before public museums became commonplace, collections of an artistic, scientific or historical nature were usually privately owned and curated by aristocrats, academics and artists.During this period, the rapid developments in science, art and travel had cultivated a taste for the unusual and novel among the more genteel classes of society. Possessing rare, exotic and bizarre objects became very fashionable, and collectors would often commission elaborately decorated cabinets to display their unique collections. Most Wunderkammer during this time were a blend of anything and everything the owner found of interest; one might find jewellery, sea shells, astrolabes, oil paintings, religious relics, taxidermy, exotic pharmaceuticals and the kitchen sink all displayed on the same shelf. However, regardless of what was in a collection, as long as it piqued the curiosity of the viewer, then it qualified as a proper Wunderkammer! The goal of the game is to curate the most valuable Cabinet of Curiosities among one's peers. During a round each player will acquire an Item Card during an Auction Phase, which may increase the point value of their Cabinet when added to their collection. After seven rounds are finished, the player with the most points wins. Setup of the game is relatively quick and straightforward. First, each player is dealt an equal number of Money Cards, of which there are four denominations. Then a deck of Item Cards is placed in the middle of the table, within everyone's reach. Points Tokens, Priority Tokens and the Dealer Token are placed near the Item Deck as well. The game is divided into seven Rounds in which every player, regardless of their performance, will acquire an Item Card for their Cabinet. Each Round consists of 4 Phases: At the start of the Evaluation Phase, the Dealer for the Round will turn over a number of Item Cards equal to the number of players in the game (for example, in a three player game, three Item Cards are turned over). This spread of Item Cards is called 'The Market'. Players will privately assess the value of each card in the Market relative to the Item Cards in their own Cabinet (and those of their opponents). Item Cards feature an Item Title (a fancy Latin name), an Item Image and one or more symbols near the bottom, called Categories. As will be explained later, players will try to acquire cards with Categories that match those of cards in their Cabinet. The Bidding Phase of Wunderkammer features a unique auction mechanic that offers considerable depth and challenge for players.Unlike conventional auctions, players do not declare a bid on a specific Item Card, rather they bid to win the highest Priority. Priority is the order in which players choose cards from the Market in the following Curation Phase.This means that players can never be certain as to what Items Cards their opponents are trying to obtain. However, by examining other players' Cabinets during the Evaluation Phase, they can try to deduce their opponent's plans.The Auction starts with the Dealer of that round and turns follow clockwise, giving each player the opportunity to bid or pass.Bidding: For the first bid of the auction, the amount can be any value above zero. The bidding player will place an amount of Money Cards face up in front of them and announce the value. It will then be the next player's turn to bid or pass. If the next player chooses to bid, they must place in front of them an amount of Money Cards greater than the bid made immediately before them.Passing: A player may instead choose to pass during their turn in the Auction Phase. If a player passes, they may not bid again for that round and any Money Cards from their previous bids remain on the table. Passing is actually what determines Priority, or the order in which players may choose Item Cards. The first player to pass in the Auction Phase will be the last player to choose an Item Card during the Curation Phase. The second player to pass will be the second last to choose a card, and so forth. After declaring a pass, the player will take a numbered Priority Token to keep track of their Priority order.The Auction Phase ends when all players but one have passed (the last person standing, so to speak). All money cards spent on bids are then removed from play; none of them are returned to the players after an auction. So when a player decides to make a bid, they better mean it!During the Curation Phase, each player will take a turn choosing an Item Card from the Market in order of highest Priority determined during the Auction Phase. So, the player that won the auction (didn't pass) will be first to choose a card, the last player to pass will be second to choose, and so on. (This is where the Priority Tokens  come in handy as they keep track of Priority order)When all of the players have chosen an Item Card, they will add it to their Cabinet by placing it on either the leftmost or rightmost end of the series (in the case of the first round, they will simply place the card in front of them). Item Cards are never placed above, below or on top of other cards in the Cabinet (except for one special case, described later). Once placed in the Cabinet, cards may not be moved or rearranged in any way. In order to earn points, a newly placed Item Card must share one or more Category icons with its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category between adjoining cards, one point is earned. There are three Categories in this game, which are based on actual classifications used by collectors long ago. They are: 

Naturalia: this category represents objects found in nature: minerals, plants, taxidermy, fossils, etc.  

Artificialia: this category represents objects of an artificial and artistic nature: sculpture, paintings, ceramics, jewellery, etc.  

Scientifica: this category represents objects that are related to the scientific fields: telescopes, astrolabes, medical apparatus, time pieces, etc.
In the early days of Wunderkammer, taxonomy wasn't strict by any means, and objects would often overlap multiple categories. This reality is reflected in the game by Item Cards that feature multiple icons. For example, an ostrich egg mounted within a silver setting would be categorised as both Artificialia and Naturalia. Or an automaton (mechanical toy), while being a marvel of engineering, is also a work of art, and would be considered as both Artificialia and Scientifica. There are also special Item Cards in the deck that are empty; they don't feature an item and have no Categories. When added to a Cabinet, they do not earn the player any points. However, players are permitted to place a newly acquired Item Card on top of an empty card in the Cabinet. Acquiring empty cards isn't necessarily a bad thing, and if played wisely they can actually be an asset later in the game. After all of the players have added their new Item Cards to their Cabinet we come to the Appraisal Phase. Players will count the number of categories shared between the newly added Item Card and its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category, a point is earned; the player will then take an appropriate number of Point Tokens and place them between the two cards to track score.After the Appraisal Phase has ended a new round begins (unless it was the seventh round, in which case the game ends). The player that won the highest Priority in the last round becomes the Dealer for the new round (and receives the Dealer Token). Priority Tokens are returned to their original place on the table. For the seventh round, things operate a little differently. Rather than holding an auction to establish who has Priority, order is determined by who has the most money (since bidding would be rather redundant). In the case where two or more players have equal amounts of money, Priority is resolved by who is first in turn order, clockwise from the dealer.After the seventh round the game has ended, and players add up all of the Point Tokens in their Cabinet. The player with the most points wins, as their Wunderkammer is, indeed, the most magnificent. In the case of a tie, a rematch is probably in order! Many people who followed development of the game or helped playtest were curious about what inspired me to start this project and the kind of research I did. Visiting museums, private collections and auctions provided a ton of ideas for things I wanted to include in the game.And being a collector as well, some items are actually based on articles in my own Wunderkammer collection.Here are a few photos I took showing example of items from my collection:With the project already fully funded, I have spent the past month working with both my manufacturer and fulfilment service planning production and logistics. The game is almost ready to hit the presses as the cards, tokens, etc. are designed.

</div></div>","Pope or Nope was launched on Kickstarter and successfully funded on July 4, 2019 with $14,259 from 453 backers.Through this InDemand campaign, you can claim one of our excess copies and receive the game just as soon as our Kickstarter backers do, in October of this year.From the team who brought you SERPENTS, comes Pope or Nope!  His Holiness Pope Peter II lies on his deathbed. You are among the few Cardinals he trusts to serve as his successor, but you have to earn it by performing good deeds. To complicate things, the other Cardinals won't go down without a fight; they'll do everything they can to sabotage your every move. Pay them back in kind. 


 
Each round, each player is dealt 5 cards.
Players are given the opportunity to play a DEED from their hand by placing it face-down in front of them. Once all players have played a DEED (if able), all players flip their cards face-up. Subsequent cards played during the round will be played on top of these initial DEEDS.
Players take turns playing one card at a time, starting with the player holding the INITIATIVE TOKEN, and continuing clockwise.
 

 
A player's turn consists of one of the following:

SABOTAGE - play a matching CROSS card on another player's DEED
REDEMPTION - play a DEED of the next level on a CROSS card
USE OF AN ACTION CARD
PASSING - out of necessity, or strategically

 
When all players have passed in succession (or have run out of cards), the round ends.
ALL cards from the round are discarded.
Any DEED that is not CROSSED at the end of the round is worth 1 point to the player.
The first player to earn 5 points wins the game.

Pope Peter II may have ideas about who should succeed him, but His Majesty King Carlos II has his own list of papabili. Work collaboratively to defeat the opposition. 
When playing with an even number of players, Pope or Nope can be played in teams. The first team to earn 7 points is the winner.
 


Watch our 6-minute comprehensive tutorial.


 

 


Numbered I-IV, these cards represent ""good deeds"" that each cardinal may perform. The higher the level, the greater the deed, and the rarer the card. DEEDS can be played on cards whose level is one less than their own. 

Numbered I-IV, these cards give each cardinal the ability to sabotage the deeds of another. CROSS cards can only be played on DEED cards of the same level. If a DEED remains CROSSED, it will not be worth a point at the end of the round.

This card is used to ""reduce"" the level of any numbered card in play by 1.
When REDUCO is played on a Level I DEED, the player is thrust into ""Dante's Infernope"". This DEED is now Level 0 and is not worth a point.

This Player has been thrust into the second circle of ""Dante's Infernope""

This card is used to ""cancel"" a card that is already in play. All cards that may be ""cancelled"" feature the CANCELLO STAMP.

When placed in front of a player this card offers a new ""opportunity"" for the performance of a good deed, and the chance to earn multiple points in a single round. 

Discard this card to draw two cards to your hand.

The POPE card acts as a ""wild"" DEED. However, it cannot be played to begin a round or to fill an OPPORTUNITAS card, and cannot be reduced. It is still vulnerable to sabotage with the correct CROSS.
When the POPE is played on a Level IV card, ""Papal Infallibility"" is invoked. This DEED can now only be sabotaged by a NOPE. 
When the POPE is played on a DEED below Level I, he lifts the player out of ""Dante's Infernope"" and acts as a Level I DEED. 
A NOPE card is the ultimate sabotage. NOPE can be played on any card in play and redemption is impossible.

<p>Nor Cal Mythos is a startup game design company. In Carbyne Jungle, we created a game system designed around everything we love in RPGs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><strong>Story:</strong></u> Carbyne Jungle takes place in an expansive universe filled with fantasy and sci-fi elements, a deep backstory, and a rich setting filled with quest seeds to get games going.</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Options:</strong></u> Our characters are completely customizable. Choose between hundreds of options of backgrounds for millions of possible combinations of abilities. </li>
<li>
<u><strong>Fun: </strong></u>We designed our game engine with three styles of gameplay for players of all skill levels, all of which can be played simultaneously. Beginners can join right into the game using a simple ruleset and not miss out on any of the fun as they learn the Stock or Strategic rules.</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Unique Gameplay: </strong></u>In addition to  traditional roleplaying, we have an autorun game for times when no one wants to GM, and a card system to assist in gameplay and in creating random dungeons.</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Game Decks:</strong></u> Our game decks make playing simpler, are used for the Flip N Fight ruleset that allows brand new gamers to jump into the RPG, and also for premade games that the entire gaming group can play. Those decks can also then be shuffled in to create random quests for players.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Amazing Gaming Experience</h3>
<p>Honestly, we believe we have built the best RPG gaming experience, and we aren't planning on stopping here.

<h2>Starting Out:</h2>
</div><div>
<p>You have a variety of species to choose from ranging from those similar to classic fantasy characters to completely new peoples with distinct cultures and tendencies. We have 12 different character archetypes to choose from, with primal archetypes like the Vatcher, Mystic, and Berzerker who use advanced technology shaped around a tribal culture. High tech classes like the Nanician, Droid Master, or Operator use heavily personalized technology to take the fight forward. We also have three Military based archetypes and the Quantum Channelers who used an advanced magic system to alter the laws of physics. See our website <a href=""http://www.norcalmythos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">norcalmythos.com</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Character Advancement:</h3>
<p>Advancement is all about your story. Each session your character grows in a path that you choose. We don't use a level system and there are no forced advancement paths that are chosen for you. You get to decide exactly what you want your character to be.</p>
<p>Advancing doesn't just mean dealing more damage. We have social advancements, group affiliations, and a skill system designed to make conflicts outside of fights just as important as fighting (although there is nothing stopping a party from having a campaign built around random mayhem. Classics never die.)</p>
<p>We have a 6 tier system that gives an idea of you current power level. Our system is designed to get you to the 6th tier after about 1 year of weekly games, but you have the option to accelerate the rate or slow it down, depending on your parties preference, and the standard rules have characters max out after about 100 sessions.</p>
<h3>Play Options</h3>
<p>The Tri-Forge game engine has 3 Modes of Gameplay built in for beginners through advanced players. The engine though is designed to have 2 (or even 3) versions of the game allowed to be played at the same time. Getting new players into an established game can be hard, especially with a complex  system, but with our game engine, new players can jump in without slowing down the game. As they get the rules down, players can graduate to the harder rulesets, or if they want just keep playing with the standard rules.</p>
<h3>Game Decks</h3>
<p>We designed Game Card Decks for prebuilt campaigns and Auto-Run games. The game cards come with statistics for targets(Think Monsters), rooms, and equipment that can make any game simpler to play. Campaign decks have everything needed to go through a campaign, with or without a GM (although nothing replaces a good Game Master.) These decks also can be mixed and match for random dungeon games. </p>

It has even been called ""<i>the best new holiday story since Rudolf!"" </i> We went on to create a CD with Ranger's song, ""Dream and Believe,"" and the full audio book, as well as an adorable 6"" soft toy ""Ranger"" to the delight of younger children.</p><p>Parents (and grandparents!) will be happy to know that the wonderful reviews of <i>Ranger </i>almost universally use the word ""inspirational"" to describe the story, and love the fact that it teaches an important lesson about self-confidence and the importance of believing in yourself.</p><p>In our house, as in  many others we're sure, <i>Candyland </i>is a wonderful game for the youngest kids, but quickly grows old, especially with older family members. We thought it would be fun to create a new board game, based on Ranger's legend, that would be fun for the entire family. The result, <i><strong>SANTALAND: Ranger's Game, </strong></i>is now ready to enter your home as part of your annual holiday traditions.

Not only was the project successful, but the book has gone on to receive awards (Mom's Choice, and MCP Grand Prize winner), and critics have been unanimous in their praise. It has even been called ""the best new holiday story since Rudolf!""  We went on to create a CD with Ranger's song, ""Dream and Believe,"" and the full audio book, as well as an adorable 6"" soft toy ""Ranger"" to the delight of younger children.Parents (and grandparents!) will be happy to know that the wonderful reviews of Ranger almost universally use the word ""inspirational"" to describe the story, and love the fact that it teaches an important lesson about self-confidence and the importance of believing in yourself.In our house, as in  many others we're sure, Candyland is a wonderful game for the youngest kids, but quickly grows old, especially with older family members. We thought it would be fun to create a new board game, based on Ranger's legend, that would be fun for the entire family. The result, SANTALAND: Ranger's Game, is now ready to enter your home as part of your annual holiday traditions. To launch SANTALAND, we have produced a limited ""Preview Edition"" and you have the opportunity to acquire one or more for your family.

The next logical step for Mars exploration is a permanent settlement, where crews travel to Mars and stay to build a new society. The founder and designer of The Pioneer Dice firmly believes that humanity will move to another planet in the future, and Mars is the most likely destination.That’s the inspiration for The Pioneer Dice set. It is the world’s first Mars settlement themed metallic polyhedral dice collection. The dice set is handcrafted, with incredible precision and intricate details, a combination of futuristic design and tactile function, inspiring dreams of space exploration. 

 
 Each dice is created with solid and durable Zinc Alloy casting and all are meticulously hand-painted in vivid colors. We have spared no effort in designing and testing the dice to make sure they are fair and balanced for all your board games. The Pioneer Dice are the perfect companion for every exciting game night.
 
  
   
 
 
 The dice box is carefully crafted to look exactly like Mars, the planet that inspired it. It’s the perfect place to safely store the dice between games. The dice box does not need a bracket, it is made to stand on its own like a dice tumbler.
 
 
 The protective pad is custom designed by our lead designer, and is unique to anything on the market. The pad is a necessary part of any board game, helping you roll the dice in a balanced and fair way, so you can better enjoy your game.",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

Clock-challenge: At the start of each turn, the player sets a 30 seconds countdown using a timer (mobile phone) or a sand-timer and try to score as many points as possible within the timing, before moving onto the next player. When the deck finishes, the player with the highest score wins!
Time-challenge: Everyone gets their mobile phone timer ready! Each player is given a total of 3 mins for the entire game. Inspired by International Chess, respective players start their individual countdown at the start of their turn and pause the timer at the end of their turn, the countdown resumes when it's come around to the same player. The game ends for the player when their clock runs out, while others continue to finish the game with their remaining time.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Heroic Yet Simple</h3>
<p>We wanted a game that was fast, simple, and transparent. <i>Spears &amp; Spells</i> is designed to help the characters be heroes without needing a half-dozen rulebooks containing hundreds of pages of confusing rules. The math is balanced to be slightly in the characters’ favor, though it’s still pretty easy for them to die if they’re not careful.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Every Die is a d6</h3>
<p>From initial stat generation to damage dice, nothing in <i>Spears &amp; Spells</i> uses any die but a d6. Having a half dozen d6s handy is a good idea.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Tasks</h3>
<p>To determine outcomes players roll dice based on their character stats.  These rolls are called Tasks. The Ref works together with the player to determine which stat governs the Task, though the Ref makes the final decision. You roll some six-sided dice, hoping the total is <i>under </i>that stat. If it is, you succeed!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Customized Characters</h3>
<p><i>Spears &amp; Spells</i> is classless, and it uses levels. Characters choose Talents at creation and level-up. How you choose Talents lets you custom-tailor your character so they can do precisely what you want them to do.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Fail-Forward</h3>
<p><i>Spears &amp; Spells</i> uses ""fail-forward"" techniques when a Task roll doesn't come up a success. Rather than failure stopping the game in its tracks, it complicates matters and makes the session more interesting!</p>

Spears & Spells is a streamlined, OSR-ish tabletop roleplaying game designed to get you telling fantastic stories with your friends in no time. It's easy to play, easy to run, and suitable for any fantasy setting, from heroic to gritty. 

Heroic Yet Simple
We wanted a game that was fast, simple, and transparent. Spears & Spells is designed to help the characters be heroes without needing a half-dozen rulebooks containing hundreds of pages of confusing rules. The math is balanced to be slightly in the characters’ favor, though it’s still pretty easy for them to die if they’re not careful.
Every Die is a d6
From initial stat generation to damage dice, nothing in Spears & Spells uses any die but a d6. Having a half dozen d6s handy is a good idea.
Tasks
To determine outcomes players roll dice based on their character stats.  These rolls are called Tasks. The Ref works together with the player to determine which stat governs the Task, though the Ref makes the final decision. You roll some six-sided dice, hoping the total is under that stat. If it is, you succeed!
Customized Characters
Spears & Spells is classless, and it uses levels. Characters choose Talents at creation and level-up. How you choose Talents lets you custom-tailor your character so they can do precisely what you want them to do.
Fail-Forward
Spears & Spells uses ""fail-forward"" techniques when a Task roll doesn't come up a success. Rather than failure stopping the game in its tracks, it complicates matters and makes the session more interesting!

Stretch Goals
$2250 - We'll add a form-fillable PDF character sheet custom-designed for Spears & Spells to make your life easier.
$2500+ - When we hit this goal - and every $250 we hit after that - we'll get a talented indie adventure writer to create another Spears & Spells adventure. If we get enough, we'll make a completely separate book of adventures, and you'll get two books instead of just one!

<p>This campaign should interest anyone who wants to make great-looking isometric maps (whether for their tabletop pen-and-paper RPG campaigns, or just as a fun creative outlet) and would like to use existing isometric assets (made by industry pros) to do so.</p>
<p>Did you know that there is a <i>vast</i> treasure trove of high-quality isometric mapping content freely available online, in the form of PNG assets from popular video/computer games? There are assets covering a wide variety of genres: modern day, near future, sci-fi, medieval, fantasy, cyberpunk, and more. </p>
<p>Anyone with a <strong>LOT</strong> of time and patience can freely download these assets (they are not behind a paywall), and utilize them to make their own custom isometric maps, using their image editor of choice (Photoshop, GIMP, MapForge, Tiled, etc.).</p>
<p>The problem is that <i>acquiring</i> the assets is <i><strong>incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive</strong></i>, since it involves manually loading and then downloading each individual asset (which requires manually editing each and every URL to get the full-resolution assets and avoid getting the asset in "".webp"" format), and there are <i>tens of thousands</i> of assets.</p>
<p>It's a gargantuan task, and since I can't redistribute the asset collections <i>directly</i> (it's not my art),  I want to create an app that will automate all the asset downloading and store the assets on your hard drive. It will do the boring grunt work for you, saving each backer hundreds of hours of this painstakingly monotonous task.</p>
<p>This $5 app will be able to load Collection files (sold separately) which contain the download links for every asset in a Collection.  It will then proceed to iterate through this list of URLs until all the assets in the Collection have been downloaded, with a progress bar showing how far along it is in this task.</p>
<p>The app will work on Windows and on Macs. Linux users should be able to run the software using WINE or Virtual Box.</p>
<h3>The Game Asset Collections offered</h3>
<p>Via this Indiegogo campaign, I am offering five Game Asset Collection files (these are essentially databases of URLs pointing to image files) that will allow you to easily and quickly download the assets from the following isometric games, using the software that will be provided to all backers:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Imperion</strong> (approx. 132 assets, sorted, $2.00)</li>
<li> <strong>Settlers Online</strong> (approx. 1250 assets, sorted, $4.00)</li>
<li> <strong>Forge of Empires</strong> (approx. 1740 assets, $4.00)</li>
<li> <strong>Cityville</strong> (over 8660 assets, sorted, $23.00)</li>
<li> <strong>Megapolis</strong> (over 15300 assets, $38.00)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule, pricing was determined as follows: $1 for every 400 assets, plus $1 if the collection is sorted (the artwork is organized into folders, for your convenience; this makes finding particular assets much easier and faster when you're making your maps).</p> <p>Please watch the following videos (preferably in fullscreen mode, which is only possible when viewing on the YouTube site) in order to preview the assets contained in each collection. Because there are <i>so many</i> assets to preview, they go by pretty fast, but feel free to pause the videos anytime to get a better look at particular assets that interest you. Note that some assets will appear pixellated because they've been ""upsized"" to match the thumbnail size (don't worry, these assets look fine at actual size). Other assets are actually <i>much</i> higher resolution than what the videos show, since I can only show smallish thumbnails due to time constraints.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All rewards for this project are digital downloads, so shipping is neither a factor nor an added expense. Battlegrounds Games has over 17 years of experience developing and distributing software and other digital content. I will be using Google Drive to host/distribute the rewards, which provides a very robust and speedy delivery method with no bandwidth limits. All but one of my many prior crowdfunding campaigns have delivered on time, and in several cases earlier than expected.</p>
</div></div>","This campaign should interest anyone who wants to make great-looking isometric maps (whether for their tabletop pen-and-paper RPG campaigns, or just as a fun creative outlet) and would like to use existing isometric assets (made by industry pros) to do so.
Did you know that there is a vast treasure trove of high-quality isometric mapping content freely available online, in the form of PNG assets from popular video/computer games? There are assets covering a wide variety of genres: modern day, near future, sci-fi, medieval, fantasy, cyberpunk, and more. 
Anyone with a LOT of time and patience can freely download these assets (they are not behind a paywall), and utilize them to make their own custom isometric maps, using their image editor of choice (Photoshop, GIMP, MapForge, Tiled, etc.).
The problem is that acquiring the assets is incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive, since it involves manually loading and then downloading each individual asset (which requires manually editing each and every URL to get the full-resolution assets and avoid getting the asset in "".webp"" format), and there are tens of thousands of assets.
It's a gargantuan task, and since I can't redistribute the asset collections directly (it's not my art),  I want to create an app that will automate all the asset downloading and store the assets on your hard drive. It will do the boring grunt work for you, saving each backer hundreds of hours of this painstakingly monotonous task.
This $5 app will be able to load Collection files (sold separately) which contain the download links for every asset in a Collection.  It will then proceed to iterate through this list of URLs until all the assets in the Collection have been downloaded, with a progress bar showing how far along it is in this task.
The app will work on Windows and on Macs. Linux users should be able to run the software using WINE or Virtual Box.
The Game Asset Collections offered
Via this Indiegogo campaign, I am offering five Game Asset Collection files (these are essentially databases of URLs pointing to image files) that will allow you to easily and quickly download the assets from the following isometric games, using the software that will be provided to all backers:

 Imperion (approx. 132 assets, sorted, $2.00)
 Settlers Online (approx. 1250 assets, sorted, $4.00)
 Forge of Empires (approx. 1740 assets, $4.00)
 Cityville (over 8660 assets, sorted, $23.00)
 Megapolis (over 15300 assets, $38.00)

As a general rule, pricing was determined as follows: $1 for every 400 assets, plus $1 if the collection is sorted (the artwork is organized into folders, for your convenience; this makes finding particular assets much easier and faster when you're making your maps). Please watch the following videos (preferably in fullscreen mode, which is only possible when viewing on the YouTube site) in order to preview the assets contained in each collection. Because there are so many assets to preview, they go by pretty fast, but feel free to pause the videos anytime to get a better look at particular assets that interest you. Note that some assets will appear pixellated because they've been ""upsized"" to match the thumbnail size (don't worry, these assets look fine at actual size). Other assets are actually much higher resolution than what the videos show, since I can only show smallish thumbnails due to time constraints.

 Note that this first video covers two collections, Imperion and Settlers Online.

 

 

 


 

The various collections are available as Add-Ons to your pledge amount. Simply add the collection/s that you would like to your $5 base pledge. This will automatically increase the amount of your pledge by the cost of the Add-On/s you desire. If you would like all the assets from all the games (totaling well over 27000 assets), pledge for the ""I Want Everything!"" pledge level to receive a discount.
IMPORTANT! All of the assets offered in this campaign are strictly for Personal Use Only. They are not to be used commercially or included in published works (even free ones).

<p><b style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">SPIDER QUEEN</b></p>
<p>The Spider Queen is pure evil. She has a penchant for piercing the hearts of those transfixed by her fair yet monstrous form. She's spiteful and sadistic to her core, with a callous lack of regard for life - even when it comes to her own kind.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597945580/e2burudxssgfmxpcrpeo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><b>WRAITH LORD</b></p>
<p>Although sensitive to sunlight, the Wraith Lord's incorporeal nature makes it nearly impervious to most physical attacks. Its repugnance to purity rolls off of it in a thick, dark miasma that makes it hard for the living to heal if they're caught.</p>
<p>It takes pleasure in transforming opponents of pure heart into paragons of darkness through Specter Manifest. Only those armed with magic &amp; silver survive an encounter.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>RAVENFOLK MASTER</b></p>
<p>​Stealthy and deceptive, what this mysterious trickster lacks in physical strength, he more than makes up for with intelligence and cunning. As an expert at espionage, the Ravenfolk Master can be a formidable foe or... a valuable ally. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597945668/ilzruzk0rn1ppniwd7fk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE LORD</b></p>
<p>Once a lowly street urchin, pick pocketing for enough copper to secure an occasional hot meal in the town tavern, he threw himself in front of the Vampire King's caravan and pledged his eternal loyalty if only he might live a better life. As a Vampire Lord, he fights viciously to protect his new status and will stop at nothing to obtain more gold, more territory and more servants. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>LIZARD KING</b></p>
<p>Stand back! You don't want to be at the end of the Lizard King's ritual axe. Venture too far into his territory, and you might make a great feast for his hungry tribe. These Lizardfolk have developed a voracious appetite for humanoid flesh, and prisoners are the perfect entree.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>BANDIT CAPTAIN</b></p>
<p>The Bandit Captain is guileful and wily. He won't hesitate to lie, cheat, or steal to get his way, but his crew believes his heart is made of gold. His boisterous personality has earned him quite the reputation around town.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597945735/nl4yoe0cdsmz2gnbppuo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>GNOLL PACK LEADER</b></p>
<p>The Gnoll Pack Leader has no semblance of a conscience. His pillaging pack attacks seemingly randomly with a frightening frenzy that could be likened to locusts. Under his orders, they leave nothing behind but flattened fields, burned buildings, and gnawed dead.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597945787/qimwrcywsrhtityoz3q8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>ORC WARCHIEF</b></p>
<p>Revered among his own kind for his brutality on the battlefield, the Orc Warchief leads his warband with ruthless bloodlust. His savage subordinates have but a single goal in mind: domination of the realm and death to all inferior races.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>ALPHA WEREWOLF</b></p>
<p>He may be fluffy, but he's NOT friendly! Other werewolves cower under his command. The Alpha Werewolf's keen hearing and smell make him a perceptive predator, and he rips and tears his prey apart ferociously.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597945838/fuhn4jblpyfbt0d4tpjx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>BUGBEAR WARLORD</b></p>
<p>This powerful master of mayhem intimidates weaker bugbears and enemies alike. The Bugbear Warlord loves carnage. There is little loyalty among the not-so-merry band he leads, but they will fight fiercely in hopes of attaining glory in the afterlife. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597945857/qvazondteaznpamnavrq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>YOUNG BLACK DRAGON</b></p>
<p>By land or by boat, you can't escape it. The Young Black Dragon delights in cruelty, and excels at swallowing up unwary visitors to the dark, damp forest that shelters its growing hoard.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>SKELETAL MINOTAUR</b></p>
<p>Dare to enter its labyrinth and it will awaken in an instant. The Skeletal Minotaur takes the shortest path towards its targets with a simpleminded desire to extinguish all life. It is silent, but for the sound of its creaking bones and clanking armor.</p>

DESIGNED FOR PAINTING
Ideal for painting enthusiasts and beginners alike. The plastic-injected models bond easily with brand name primers. Customize your characters and enjoy expanding upon your painting skills and impress your friends with these unique characters.


SPIDER QUEEN
The Spider Queen is pure evil. She has a penchant for piercing the hearts of those transfixed by her fair yet monstrous form. She's spiteful and sadistic to her core, with a callous lack of regard for life - even when it comes to her own kind.


 
WRAITH LORD
Although sensitive to sunlight, the Wraith Lord's incorporeal nature makes it nearly impervious to most physical attacks. Its repugnance to purity rolls off of it in a thick, dark miasma that makes it hard for the living to heal if they're caught.
It takes pleasure in transforming opponents of pure heart into paragons of darkness through Specter Manifest. Only those armed with magic & silver survive an encounter.


 
RAVENFOLK MASTER
​Stealthy and deceptive, what this mysterious trickster lacks in physical strength, he more than makes up for with intelligence and cunning. As an expert at espionage, the Ravenfolk Master can be a formidable foe or... a valuable ally. 

 
VAMPIRE LORD
Once a lowly street urchin, pick pocketing for enough copper to secure an occasional hot meal in the town tavern, he threw himself in front of the Vampire King's caravan and pledged his eternal loyalty if only he might live a better life. As a Vampire Lord, he fights viciously to protect his new status and will stop at nothing to obtain more gold, more territory and more servants. 

 
LIZARD KING
Stand back! You don't want to be at the end of the Lizard King's ritual axe. Venture too far into his territory, and you might make a great feast for his hungry tribe. These Lizardfolk have developed a voracious appetite for humanoid flesh, and prisoners are the perfect entree.

 
BANDIT CAPTAIN
The Bandit Captain is guileful and wily. He won't hesitate to lie, cheat, or steal to get his way, but his crew believes his heart is made of gold. His boisterous personality has earned him quite the reputation around town.

 
GNOLL PACK LEADER
The Gnoll Pack Leader has no semblance of a conscience. His pillaging pack attacks seemingly randomly with a frightening frenzy that could be likened to locusts. Under his orders, they leave nothing behind but flattened fields, burned buildings, and gnawed dead.

 
ORC WARCHIEF
Revered among his own kind for his brutality on the battlefield, the Orc Warchief leads his warband with ruthless bloodlust. His savage subordinates have but a single goal in mind: domination of the realm and death to all inferior races.

 
ALPHA WEREWOLF
He may be fluffy, but he's NOT friendly! Other werewolves cower under his command. The Alpha Werewolf's keen hearing and smell make him a perceptive predator, and he rips and tears his prey apart ferociously.

 
BUGBEAR WARLORD
This powerful master of mayhem intimidates weaker bugbears and enemies alike. The Bugbear Warlord loves carnage. There is little loyalty among the not-so-merry band he leads, but they will fight fiercely in hopes of attaining glory in the afterlife. 

 
YOUNG BLACK DRAGON
By land or by boat, you can't escape it. The Young Black Dragon delights in cruelty, and excels at swallowing up unwary visitors to the dark, damp forest that shelters its growing hoard.

 
SKELETAL MINOTAUR
Dare to enter its labyrinth and it will awaken in an instant. The Skeletal Minotaur takes the shortest path towards its targets with a simpleminded desire to extinguish all life. It is silent, but for the sound of its creaking bones and clanking armor.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holding is a ground-breaking economic board game where players use their imagination and their negotiation, improvisation and anticipation skills. Get in on the ground floor with this generation’s answer to next generation of economic games!</li>
<li>I want to use the Indiegogo campaign to create a way to take the game to the final stage – making it available in brick-and-mortar stores and creating an e-shop. My primary motivation is to create a game that suppresses the luck factor to the greatest possible extent. The main success factors in the game will be negotiation, alliance, strategy and logical thinking.</li>

<p> </p>
<h3>Key features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Trade</strong> – you have a free hand to trade anything in the game with very few limitations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Make deals</strong> – is one player too strong? Gang up on them and take them out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Graphics </strong>– over 80 beautiful hand-drawn illustrations.</li>
<li>
<strong>RPG elements</strong> – the game features eight unique characters and you can use their skills to protect or expand your business.</li>
<li>
<strong>Handful of opportunities </strong>– 25 companies to buy, 20 countries to expand into, four service sectors, a bank, a casino, universities and much more. You can defeat your opponents in any number of ways.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unexpected events</strong> – these can affect your business a great deal.  A Communist coup, war, civil unrest, Nazism… anything can happen. Holding has the right answer. Is it enough to own insurance companies and sell insurance to all your opponents or just to some of them? You decide!</li>
</ul>
<p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508262562/k65bpoawfofdcoqtshxf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>             </p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<h2>Goods</h2>
<p>If you want to start building your Holding, you can choose which way to go. Your first option is to buy companies and enter markets in selected countries. Every country needs different raw materials – some need tobacco, some oil, some cars or a combination of those. Only you choose the countries you will expand to, if you prefer to wait and buy more companies or expand as soon as you can. But be careful – every country is profitable in a different way, some more and some less, so don’t hesitate too much to enter the market. Leaving a country after you’ve entered its market costs you a lot of resources so you should think twice about where to expand or if you’d better wait.</p>

<p>                          </p>
<h3>​Services</h3>
<p>Another way to beat your opponents is to build an empire in the service sector. If you are not successful or you feel that the market for goods is not the way to go, you can choose from these companies</p>
<p><strong>Post Office</strong> – every player needs postal services, especially when operating in more than one country. If a player decides to use it, the service has to be paid for, so why shouldn’t that money go to you? Naturally, the more countries the player controls, the more money is paid.</p>
<p>                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508177270/miynzecriwpeaox3uaua.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>                  </p>
<p><strong>Law Firm </strong>– it is useless if you only have one, but if you hold on, invest and buy them all, you can roll the dice twice and choose which roll to use. This is a huge advantage over your opponents.</p>
<p>                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508178017/lf3e1jndppqxrrrjn8qk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Audit </strong>– every owner of a manufacturing company needs auditors. There are three audit spaces on the game board. If you buy them all, you will be able to charge a fortune for your services. And the more companies your opponents have, the more you charge them.</p>
<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508178050/pimse5f1cj3ouvzbburi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Insurance company</strong> – if you own one, you are protected from unexpected events. If you own all of them, you can sell insurance and you alone decide to whom and at what price you sell.                                                           </p>

<h3>Disasters</h3>
<p>Disasters, unexpected events like war, Communism, monetary reform, civil unrest – all of these are terrible for business. Unfortunately, they can happen to you in Holding, too, just like they can happen in the real world. You can insure against them. If you don’t, you can expect:</p>
<p><strong>Civil unrest</strong> – one company of every player is destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Socialism </strong>– taxes have increased, the Tax Office charges 30% instead of 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Strike</strong> – your employees want to get a raise and it will cost you 5,000 for every company.</p>
<p><strong>War </strong>– countries need more money to fund the war. It costs you 5,000 for every country where you work.</p>
<p><strong>Communism</strong> – class warfare. The player with the most cash will lose half of their money.</p>
<p><strong>Nazism </strong>– a random player will lose half of their cash.</p>
<p><strong>Currency reform</strong> – every player will hand in 30% of their cash.</p>
<p><strong>Natural disaster </strong>– every company has been damaged, players pay for repairs.</p>

<li>
<strong>Head to Head</strong> - 1vs1 style game, each player alternates shooting balls</li>
<li>
<strong>2vs2</strong> - Each team takes 2 shots, if both balls make a cup, that team gets a bonus shot</li>
<li>
<strong>H-O-R-S-E</strong> - Call your shot, make your shot, and see if your friends can too</li>

We're super excited and equally proud of the work everyone has put in to make this happen. We're now officially ready, set, GO! to bring this beauty out to all of you. 4Pong is designed to be the Next Generation Party Game. The game is more fun and more challenging than traditional Beer Pong. It's perfect for Tailgating, Man Caves, simple House Kick Backs, and more.Order now to get $40 off your 4Pong Set!!!Play Your WayThere are a lot of different ways to play 4Pong. We intentionally designed it for your interpretation. There are no hard rules-- just like Beer Pong, it's house rules. But, we do have some suggestions of our favorite game play modes that we have played so far:

Head to Head - 1vs1 style game, each player alternates shooting balls

2vs2 - Each team takes 2 shots, if both balls make a cup, that team gets a bonus shot

H-O-R-S-E - Call your shot, make your shot, and see if your friends can too

Melee - Our Favorite - Two big teams rapid firing until 4-In-A-Row is achieved

 What Makes it Different?
Every aspect of the game's design is purposeful.
Great balance between players. The ""first player advantage"" found in most turn-based games has been reduced through the game's design, and was tested by human and computer players like a zillion times.
Kuzushi Seasons is simple to play but difficult to master. We've spent a lot of time getting a classic board game feel -- the more you put into it the more you get out of it.
The visual design is simple, iconic, and easy on the eyes. The colors and images are all very accessible for players with visual impairment or color blindness.
It's super portable -- there's definitely space for it in your collection. But this isn't just for size. The cards are easy to hold, easy to remove or flip, and have a low impact on the environment.

Each location should take 30 minutes when played in 2 player mode, 45 minutes for 3 players, and around 70 minutes for 4 players. The whole game takes between 90 and 210 minutes.

As a competition game, players compet  against the game and each other, but sometimes they need to  work together to battle enemies, explore locations, or start an alliance against other players.The Hero Starter set has 3 locations (Humphreydale, Dirty Town Centre and Granbury) and 4 scenarios. Each location should take 30 minutes when played in 2 player mode, 45 minutes for 3 players, and around 70 minutes for 4 players. The whole game takes between 90 and 210 minutes. So grab some sodas and chips for the evening and have fun!The first thing you have to do is choose which scenario you will play: Trophy Race - whoever gets to the end first wins, Emergency Service - you win when you finish a certain number of tasks, Razzling Master -you win when you finish a certain number of duels, and Villain Hunter - win when you defeat a certain number of villains.Next, you deal 1 of 6 Heroic Challenge cards to each player. This is an optional task on the side to complete that gives you extra prizes!Now you choose the Hero you want to play with. You can play a Male which is generally Stronger but has less Stamina, or a Female character which has less Strength but more Stamina.In the Starter version you have 4 Heroes. Each Extension Kit gives you one unique Hero. Place your Hero card on a Hero board and use number markers to fill in your Strength and Stamina stats.What is on a Hero Board? The numbers 1 - 4 - item slots  /  H -Hero card slot  /   S - Sidekick slotEach player also receives 5 gold coins.Determine who starts the game by throwing a Green dice. The player who roll the highest number will start the game.When exploring each Location you will come across different tasks and events. Here are some spots you can see on the map:Fighting SystemThe most important task in the game is to collect gold coins and donuts, so you can improve your character's chances in Duels and Villain battles. One way of getting them is to complete tasks in ""Heroic deeds' and ""Call"" cards. Another way is to win them in duels with other players on the way to glory.

(40 / 10 = 4) It means you need only 4 points on the dice to win. Boss stats are: Strength - 2 and Stamina - 40.

<p>This first Indiegogo campaign for Atomic Armour is raising funds to order sprues of our first product: The Genghis Main Battle Tank. We have already self-funded the significant cost of the injection molding tool and can order its manufacture and order the first batch of sprues after we have reached our goal.</p>
<p>This means we need your support to make the game a reality and get it into your eager hands. We know with the early support of players, Atomic Armour could become a popular and widely played game across the world with a long list of great units, background and more! </p>

<p>You can order a single tank, a small cohort of three tanks or (best of all) the Battlebox starter set that contains six tanks, two unique turrets, two sets of combat modules and a set of printed tokens. This great value set is everything you need to play the game with a friend. </p>

<p>The first tank for Atomic Armour is the Genghis Main Battle Tank. It is an all-rounder with three standard weapon options, slots for two combat modules and a space for Cargo. Any tank with a turret space in Atomic Armour can take  any turret, so the genghis has infinite flexibility. </p>

<p>In the pictures of the Genghis 3D prints above, you see the rear of the tank is a draw that slides open and closed so you can place smaller units inside the tank and transport them. The turret and combat modules each have holes for magnets so you can easily magnetize your tanks.  </p>

<p>We understand that when people support us on Indiegogo it can feel like a risk, but, without those first great costumers and their trust we will never make Atomic Armour a reality. </p>
<p>The primary cost is our sprue; Injection molding can be an expensive thing to start with. ​We have already self funded the cost of our tools and we have secured quotes from UK manufacture, Dudley Associates. Dudley Associates have worked with other miniature companies and have the ability to manufacture everything in house. We will also be able to visit their facility regulary and can trust them to do a magnificent job. </p>

<p>All that remains now is the order itself which we will make once we have funded and scale to demand. We want plenty of control over the production of our products and so will be manufacturing everything locally and avoid using Chinese companies abroad as it can lead to issues in shipping, import and quality control.   </p>
<p>We will also be packing our products ourselves in our small UK warehouse and be shipping with a variety of capable fulfillment companies depending on the address of the delivery.</p>
<p>All planned costs have factored into our funding level and we know we can fulfill our perks when we reach our goal.   </p>

This first Indiegogo campaign for Atomic Armour is raising funds to order sprues of our first product: The Genghis Main Battle Tank. We have already self-funded the significant cost of the injection molding tool and can order its manufacture and order the first batch of sprues after we have reached our goal.
This means we need your support to make the game a reality and get it into your eager hands. We know with the early support of players, Atomic Armour could become a popular and widely played game across the world with a long list of great units, background and more! 


A render of the Battlebox starter set, with cargo cubes, tokens, combat modules and more!  
You can order a single tank, a small cohort of three tanks or (best of all) the Battlebox starter set that contains six tanks, two unique turrets, two sets of combat modules and a set of printed tokens. This great value set is everything you need to play the game with a friend. 

The first tank for Atomic Armour is the Genghis Main Battle Tank. It is an all-rounder with three standard weapon options, slots for two combat modules and a space for Cargo. Any tank with a turret space in Atomic Armour can take  any turret, so the genghis has infinite flexibility. 

The Renders above show the three weapons that come with the standard sprue as well as a few different combat modules (one in the turret and one in the front hull) that can be used to grant your tank different abilities, bonuses and tactical options.  


In the pictures of the Genghis 3D prints above, you see the rear of the tank is a draw that slides open and closed so you can place smaller units inside the tank and transport them. The turret and combat modules each have holes for magnets so you can easily magnetize your tanks.  
The Genghis MBT will be sold in injection molded plastic. The components are clipped from this sprue and glued together. The tank comes with a cargo cube and three hatch options (one open, two closed), it comes with separate wheels so they can be glued in any configuration.  

A cohort of gladius-wielding tanks advance across an open field to assault their enemy.

We have lots of ideas for the future of Atomic Armour; the Genghis is only the first in a long line of products we want to create for the game. For the first year of releases we will focus almost exclusively on tanks and ground vehicles as well as small disposable drones and tank upgrades. Added to this we will constantly add to our online rulebook; improving our rules and releasing more background for our world. We intend to run a series of Indiegogo campaigns to release waves of new units, a simple plan can be found below, showing the major releases.
Wave 1 – September 2020 Indiegogo Launch 
“Genghis” Main Battle Tank – Heavy Turret, Marker Turret, Missile Turret 
The Genghis is the all-purpose tank used by almost all cohorts for its versatility and reliability. 
Wave 2 – November 2020 Indiegogo Launch 
“Shakka” Scout Tank – Light Turret, Combat Module Turret
Fast but lightly armoured the Shakka can easily flank or act as a dangerous glass cannon.
“Hannibal” Transporter / Mobile Artillery
​The Hannibal can be outfitted to transport or can mount a range of artillery weapons. 
Wave 3 – February 2021 Indiegogo Launch 
“Boudica” Light Assault Vehicle 
A small fast, tracked vehicle able to carry cargo or a single human in heavy armour. 
“?” Patrol Walker 
A small walker with light weapons that can reliably guard objectives or fight in dense terrain.  
“Hadrian” Hex Fort – Support Turret, Reinforced Hull Turret
An immobile but heavily armoured Bunker that can cordon off areas of the battlefield.    
Wave 4 – May 2021 Indiegogo Launch 

“?” Tank Destroyer  

A well armoured highly accurate tank that can take hull mounted weapons. 
“?” Support Tank – Repair Turret
A tough, slow, purposeful tank that has abilities allowing it to support the cohort. 
“?” Gunship
A hovering gunship that can rapidly reposition to avoid fire or attack vulnerable spots quickly.  
Wave 5 – August 2021 Indiegogo Launch 
“?” Heavy Transporter – Undefined Turret
A large transport with a cargo of six and armour to make sure it gets were it is going. 
“Leonidas” Heavy Battle Tank – Undefined Turret 
A big scary battle tank that will terrify your enemies but perhaps bankrupt your complex… 
Extended Hardback Rulebook 
The first Hardback print of our rulebook with lots of new art, hobby material, stories, and campaign rules. The basic rules will always be free, you will not need to buy this book to play. 

Jotun prowls through the ashy ruins of a destroyed city searching for valuable technology.


Our Rulebook is available for download by clinking the image above. This is just the first version of our rules and through the coming year we intend to add to them and emend them. Our rules will always be available to download for free online even when we print them one day.
 

We have a great, engaged following on Facebook. Consider visiting our page to receive regular updates through the year and beyond on the progress of Atomic Armour.  
 

The Atomic Armour YouTube Channel currently has one video but we will soon post regular videos there of assembling, painting and gaming with our products. 
 

We understand that when people support us on Indiegogo it can feel like a risk, but, without those first great costumers and their trust we will never make Atomic Armour a reality. 
The primary cost is our sprue; Injection molding can be an expensive thing to start with. ​We have already self funded the cost of our tools and we have secured quotes from UK manufacture, Dudley Associates. Dudley Associates have worked with other miniature companies and have the ability to manufacture everything in house. We will also be able to visit their facility regulary and can trust them to do a magnificent job. 

All that remains now is the order itself which we will make once we have funded and scale to demand. We want plenty of control over the production of our products and so will be manufacturing everything locally and avoid using Chinese companies abroad as it can lead to issues in shipping, import and quality control.   
We will also be packing our products ourselves in our small UK warehouse and be shipping with a variety of capable fulfillment companies depending on the address of the delivery.
All planned costs have factored into our funding level and we know we can fulfill our perks when we reach our goal.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Mr Pink Pants is an adventure game that requires some seriously weird imagination to play. It's a 2-4 player game. Each player draws a card until they receive a situation card. The player is then supposed to solve the situation using the item cards they collected from the deck of cards. In addition to situation cards and item cards are mystery cards that make you miss a turn or just grab any players card.<br/><br/>Any player that cannot solve the situation using their item cards is out of the game. The last player standing is obviously a winner. Did we tell you that there are magic beans in the game ? Ok , we've said too much. Kong. OK bye.</p>

It has its own very convenient and exciting features:Dice Tower closes with a magnetic latch to secure the game components in it from falling out. Its function is to improve reliability, namely to prevent accidental opening of the tower. Keep in safeThe latch has two degrees of protection: the rotation of the plate of the upper part of the tower ridge and the magnet. When assembled, the dice tray serves as the top cover of the tower and reliably fixes the latch.Until you remove the tray-cover, the latch cannot be rotated. The tower can be used separately, and at the same time, it serves as storage for all of organizer's components.In the standard Full Set it accommodates a combination of:· Dicebox - 1 pcs· Simple Tiles - 12 pcs· Bank Tiles 2 pcs· Coasters - 4 pcsYou can create your personal configuration with any possible combination of modular gaming accessories in any designs. You will tell us the details in the pledge manager.Dice Tower dimensions:·  Folded - 5.51x6.37x10.63 inches (140x162x270 mm)·  Unfolded - 5.51x6.37x9.84 inches (140x162x250 mm)Internal height/capacity of the tower: 8.45 inches (214 mm)Dice Tray dimensions: thickness of 0.98 inches, the radius of 3.19 inches (25mm thickness, 81mm radius)A special slope is made at the top of the tower so that the dice will dive into the hole on any throw. Drop your dice!The top cover of the tower serves as a tray for catching dice rolling out of the tower. It resembles a lowered suspension bridge in front of the castle gates, to which the guards run out to defend their castle. In the game, these are rolling cubes that decide the fate of your game.Have you ever blamed yourself for a bad roll of the dice? With our tower, you can forget about it and let it decide your fate. 4 levels inside the tower improve the randomness of the results of throwing dice, making them rotate uniquely and change the drop values.Install in a secondThe distance between the levels (2 inches) is sufficient to roll any number of dice, and they will not get stuck inside.The levels are very easily installed in special grooves inside the tower, then they are ideally folded on top and covered with a dice tray. The Dice Tray is conveniently mounted to the tower using two pairs of magnets.Just light touch to addWhen assembled, the dice tray serves as the top cover of the tower so that the toothed protuberances of the tray fit perfectly into the protrusions of the tower and are also held by 3 pairs of magnets.Right place for all itemsBE WOOD modular tiles is a magnetic modular hex tile system that you can use with board games and role-playing games.Each tile has magnets installed on the sides of the hexagon so that they can connect to each other and create an interlocking system.Tiles are multifunctional! You can mix and match tiles in a way that suits you.Hexagonal tiles have the same outer dimensions and can be conveniently folded for storage and transportation in the Dice Tower. Each tile is provided with a label so that the magnets’ poles are connected to other magnets.There are 12 Simple Tile designs and 4 Bank Tile designs in total. They are shown in the photo, and you will choose the end of the project when you receive a survey from us.Simple Tile Dimensions: 0.4 ""thick, 2.28"" radius (10mm thick, 58mm radius)Bank Tile dimensions: 0.8 ""thick, 2.28"" radius (20mm thick, 58mm radius)This dice box is of the same size as the dice arena and it has removable partitions inside which divide it into 4 segments. The prices the for Dice Box XL start from $30 in Alder, $32 in Maple and Cherry and $35 in Oak.Its hexagonal shape perfectly matches your tabletop tiles. It also has thumb notches, so the box is easier to open without spilling out the contents. The lid of the box is securely held by magnetic latches that will not open even if dropped. At the same time, it can be opened quite easily with your thumb. The box is deep, and the inner border holds the lid securely in place.Dice Box Dimensions: 1.18 ""Thick, 2.28"" Radius (30mm Thick, 58mm Radius)Inner Dimension: 0.87 ""The coasters are made from the same woods as your other components. Each stand has cork inserts to help protect the wood from condensation or water damage.Their hexagonal shape and dimensions are the same as table tiles, allowing them to blend perfectly on the gaming table and fold into the Dice Tower for storage and transport. Coaster Dimensions: 0.2"" thick, 2.28"" radius (5mm thick, 58mm radius) All components of the BE WOOD modular system are available in a 4 types of wood.

<h2>Simpl</h2>
<p>Hi. We're Rambo and Morris and we have created a beautiful and elegant deck of cards, Simpl. </p> <p>This deck was created and tailored specifically for the minimalist-minded. Unnecessary details were excluded, empty space was retained, shapes and positioning have been meticulously determined and are evenly spaced. We designed Simpl to be beautiful yet usable. Corner symbols remain to easily identify what cards are in your hand. Middle symbols remain to clearly show what card has been played on the table. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The cards are made in traditional poker sizes, 2.5"" X 3.5"" with an S30 smooth finish. Whether while playing or displaying in your home this deck is designed to subtle and beautiful. Simpl is available in two versions:</p>
<p>Classic White</p>
<p>Matte Black</p> <p>If this project speaks to you please consider backing it and bringing Simpl to life. We know you will thoroughly enjoy it.</p> <p>- Rambo &amp; Morris</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Sample Decks</h3>
<p>We have received our sample decks and they turned out better than we could have ever expected! We are excited to share them with you. Check our updates to see more photos of our sample decks.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals 1 - $5,000</h3>
<p>Thank you to all our wonderful backers! We appreciate the early support we've received from all of you and look forward to sending you Simpl. Because of all of you, we funded in 87 hours, blowing our expectations completely away! We are now excited to introduce our first stretch goal. We have already designed 54 Simpl cards (including Jokers) and we are able to print 55 for each deck. If we reach our goal we want each of you to help decide what the 55th card should be! The first stretch goal will be $5,000. When we reach it we will make a list of you who backed us up to this point and a survey will be sent out to only you. The survey will have multiple options for you to vote on and have a voice in what would make the best 55th card! </p>
<p>Again, we deeply appreciate all the support we have already received. We have much more planned and are excited to reveal them in our next stretch goals!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal 1.5 - $7,500</h3>
<p>We were originally planning on having our next stretch goal at $10,000 but we decided to have a bonus goal in-between to do something a little different from most campaigns. We want to show our appreciate to our backers with hand-written thank you notes. We know it's not much but we just want you all to know how thankful we are. Everyone who backs before we hit $7,500 will get a personal handwritten note from us!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal 2 - $10,000</h3>
<p>In our survey sent out after our first stretch goal we chose a specialty card to be added to the deck. The highest voted card was the 4 suits. The next highest voted card was the blank card. Because we think that the blank card adds an eloquent and minimal touch to the deck we want to add to the deck as well. If we hit $10,000 we will include a blank card to each deck.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes and there are always going to be challenges to overcome. Hopefully, we won't have any but if we do we will keep everyone updated.</p>
<p>Due to the cost of manufacturing, we face the risk of needing to mass-produce the deck in order to be profitable. We have set our goal limit to a range reasonable to produce your deck and still be profitable.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, there is a possibility of delayed manufacturing and shipping. We have planned and are confident we will be able to deal with this challenge.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a twisty puzzle and crossword enthusiast I have decided to combine both of my passions into a portable,light and fun toy named QubOrd. Qubord is a handmade modification of the world known Sheng Shou 5x5 cube. The ShengShou 5x5 cube is a perfect-size 5x5 that has exceptional inner and outer layer turning ability. ShengShou 5x5 has a sturdy feel. Pops and lockups are rare. The pieces that are made are not made with the same plastic.  The plastic made for the ShengShou has a smoother finish and polish to it.  The pieces in particular are a little more flush with the other pieces.  Overall, the mechanism is fast and smooth and that’s a good thing. Hence, I have chosen to modify this particular cube which is suitable also for speed cubing. Should this campaign succeed I intend to modify several other well-known cube mechanisms to cover every need.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495736326/wlxgjctcltbm615zw0fx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The 5 x 5 cube twists vertically and horizontally like the puzzle cube with blank colored squares, and the object is to form words by solving clues which lead to the answers on the sides- instead of matching colors. The words do not cross each other and are formed only horizontally. The answer words are placed in the grid from left to right. However, the letters on the pieces force the solver to become aware that each one can be in one of four orientations, thus increasing the total number of combinations. This adds to the difficulty of the puzzle but not astronomically (bear in mind that a 5x5 cube has 283 trevigintillion possible combinations!). In a standard Rubik's Cube, the player must match up colours on each side of the cube. In the QubOrd, the player must place the letters on each side with no repetition,in order to answer the given clue. This cube is one of the most difficult of all  cubes because as well as having to know the basic cubes concepts you also have to possess a broad general knowledge. Unlike normal crossword, any turn of the cube can wipe out work you just did.The clues for each word comes to a laminated card coloured accordingly to each side it represents.</p>
<p>Solving a QubOrd comes in two parts.  Firstly, the forming words aspect.  Solve the clues which lead to the answers. Each letter has an exact position on the grid.Secondly,the 5x5 cube solving aspect.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we really need is to put QubOrd into production.In order to do that we need your support.This product is for you and you only.We do not plan to stop here,the best is yet to come,but like Aristotle's wrote in his Nicomachean Ethics “The beginning seems to be more than half of the whole"". Hence, we need a good start!</p>
<p>The QubOrd you get comes in two levels of difficulty: <strong>Basic</strong>  and <strong>Hard</strong>.</p>
<p>On the <strong><i>Basic pack</i> </strong>the clues are quite straightforward and require average knowledge on one of the available themes/subjects (History,Geography,Science,General Knowledge ). </p>
<p>On the <i><strong>Hard pack</strong></i> the only difference is that the clues require extensive,in depth knowledge on the selected subject.</p>
<p>Lastly, we offer a <i><strong>Kids Pack</strong></i> as well, in which all words are exactly the same on every side of the cube and ,obviously, the clues are quite straightforward and basic.Its an introduction of our young fellows to the QubOrd world.</p>
<p>Τhe clues for each word have been handpicked very carefully and they vary in difficulty.</p>
<p>Each cube comes in a scrambled state,  unless otherwise asked. The reason for doing so, is that QubOrd is not a typical,classic 3-D combination puzzle,but has an educational nature as well.User will not practice and improve his/her knowledge if the answer just lies there.The whole purpose of the apparatus would be lost!</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>With <strong>Lucky Draw</strong>, our mission is to bring families back together again. With social media and video games, it seems like family is beginning to slip away. <strong>Lucky Draw</strong> is an exciting, family game of luck, for all ages. If you love all of the classic card games, than <strong>Lucky Draw</strong> is the game for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How to play Lucky Draw</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Object of the game is to get all your cards turned over in the round and get a point. First player to get five points wins the game!!!</p>
<p>First you need 2 to 4 players. Choose a player to deal cards (each round there is a new dealer going clockwise from first dealer). Deal each player 10 cards face down. Place remaining cards in a pile face down. Leave room next to it for a discard pile. Next place cards in 2 rows of five. The top row being 1 through 5 and the bottom row being 6 through 10. Next each player must choose a different color, red, yellow, blue or green. Each round players can choose a different color. Player to left of the dealer begins round drawing from the top of the deck. If the card drawn is their color and number they need, place it in the correct spot face up (example if you draw a 3 card place it in the third spot from the left on the top row) and pick up and turn the card that was in that spot. If this is the right color and number you need, continue until you get a card you can't use. If you get a card you can't use but the card is one that the player who's turn is next can use, hand it to them and this begins their turn. If they can't use it, place it in the discard pile and they begin by drawing from the deck. Continue playing until a player gets all the cards turned over. This player gets a point. The remaining players get one more turn to see if they can go on a roll and turn the rest of their cards over. If any players do, they get a point. After that round if any players have any cards unturned they must turn over the rest of the unturned cards. If a player has all the cards they need in or out of place, they also get a point. Reshuffle cards and begin a new round. The first player to get five points wins the game!!!</p>
<p>There are three special cards. Stop, reverse and wild. The Stop card ends your turn. The Reverse card makes play go in the opposite direction. The wild card can be used for any spot you need. If you go to put a wild card down in the spot you choose and the card you pick up already was the right color and number, place it back in that spot face up and move wild to another spot. Continue until you get a card you can't use.</p>

<h2>More than 1 year in the making</h2>
<p>Making a party game takes a lot of hard work! Because Llamasters is not your typical game and features AR component, our team has worked hard for over a year to bring it to this point.</p>
<p>This is our passion and we take it all very seriously, which is why we invested a lot of personal time and money into this game. Creating Augmented Reality (AR) pieces is a pricey endeavour, but we didn’t mind because we only wanted to create something fun yet unique.</p>
<p>We also built it on two different platforms (Android and iOS) and spent a lot of time testing to make sure that anyone wanted to have access to Llamasters. Developing the AR portion of the game was tedious and took a lot of experimenting and testing.</p>
<p>Once all the technical stuff was done, we spent countless hours developing content to build our Kickstarter campaign. We even tested different risk management plans to ensure the greatest success for the game!</p>
<p>While we reached great success already, we are still in a need of support. This is your chance to help us and support us to keep going and growing.</p>
<h3>Also!</h3>
<p>We wouldn’t be here without the help and support of so many people around us. Today we want to recognize and say thank you to 100 testers that used their personal time to help us test Llamasters game and share their user experience with us. This invaluable feedback helped us make the game even better. Thank you. ❤️?<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617120068/m2dpxi01bpvouctrk8g7.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Our story</h2>
<p>During the quarantine we were bored. Yup, really bored. But more than being bored we missed our family and friends. We missed playing board games together, and just having fun and laughing together. Let’s face it, relationships are the most valuable things we have in our lives and quarantine made it obvious that we took them for granted. A simple board game was no longer possible. A fun night with friends was a pipe dream.</p>
<p>After realizing this we decided to find a way that would bring us closer together, help us nurture our relationships and also have loads of fun! This was the premise Llamasters was built on. A way to connect all of us even more! It’s so important that we laugh, especially during these difficult times, and Llamasters is all about making you laugh!</p>
<p>Like great chefs in the kitchen, we tried to combine the best ingredients that sometimes don’t seem like they go together but instead they create perfect harmony. You know what we mean - like a salted caramel ice-cream. You’d never think to put salt on the caramel, but boy it’s delicious. When creating this game we took the same approach. We paired the two amazing ingredients to create something unique and fun. We took a fun card game and combined it with augmented reality to take your entertainment to the next level.</p>
<p>Regardless if you are a teenager, an executive, parent or a grandparent, Llamasters will provide you with a special and unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>We had so much fun playing this game with our friends and family that we wanted to make it available to everyone. We’ve never done anything like this before so we need your help and support. As we all play together we can make improvements as a community and create a kingdom like no other.</p>
<p>So, if you want to play with us, get to know a bunch of crazy Llamas, and maybe even have a custom llama created just for you, please back this project and help us build this game.</p>
<p>Salute,</p>

You know what we mean - like a salted caramel ice-cream. You’d never think to put salt on the caramel, but boy it’s delicious. When creating this game we took the same approach. We paired the two amazing ingredients to create something unique and fun. We took a fun card game and combined it with augmented reality to take your entertainment to the next level.
Regardless if you are a teenager, an executive, parent or a grandparent, Llamasters will provide you with a special and unforgettable experience.
We had so much fun playing this game with our friends and family that we wanted to make it available to everyone. We’ve never done anything like this before so we need your help and support. As we all play together we can make improvements as a community and create a kingdom like no other.
So, if you want to play with us, get to know a bunch of crazy Llamas, and maybe even have a custom llama created just for you, please back this project and help us build this game.
Salute,
Maya,Eli, George and Gabriel",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Foleys playing cards</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi every one welcome to the Re-launch of Foleys playing cards.</p>
<p>We understand we were over ambitious with our first project, we were trying to pull out all the stops with are first kickstarter. We wanted top quality cards with gold stamping and customs gold seals.</p>
<p>We also planned to use debossed tuck boxes with gold stamping text and logos. We also wanted to use  gold foil in the inside of the tucks. Over ambitious right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This doesn't mean we don't want this in the future. (<strong>That's where stretch goals come In</strong> )</p>
<p> We are still using custom decks, tucks and seals.  We  will have high quality casino stock from uspcc bee collection as we want the cards to be high quality and durable for the user. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will still be using the same card designs and tucks and seal design, but they will be  printed with pentone PMS 871 ink. The gold on the cards and tucks will have gold ink the same with any gold on the design of this project and instead of 2,000 card printing, will be making just 1,000. This is all to keep better control of cost and keep the price down.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So you maybe wondering about the debossing and gold stamping?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I previously mentioned we will aim for this in our future projects as we feel this will make us stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Our stretch goals will be as follows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gold stamped seals (this will be 40p per seal) 1,000 is £1400</li>
<li> MetalLuxe for backs of cards (this will be £9.16 per deck 1,000 is £9,160) Another printing of 500 more standard. will be another £170 making up to 1.500 prints a total off £4,870</li>
<li>Traditional cut 10p per deck</li>
<li>Crushed stock 500 pounds.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>If your wondering how will you get the new updates from the standard design. Don't worry it will be automatically changed to any goals we reach with no extra cost..<strong> </strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Are standard Print including custom tucks, seals and cards will be</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> 1,000 decks: £4,02 per deck, a total of £3.920 unless stretch goal is reached, then another 500 will be added.</li>
<li>The casino stock is included in the price above</li>
<li>Double backer for double lifts</li>
<li>Card design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We have used Arrco face card design for the fronts as people tend to like close to the original look. But we have changed some colors and added are little marks and fully redesigned the pips</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tucks.</strong></p>
<p>The tucks will be a stander print. with no embossing or gold foil.</p>
<p>This will be a stretch goal, and this will be announced and added to the pledge page once is unlocked or close.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489532138/yvmfly7tfb5lmnoqgekn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><u>This will be the look of the tucks, plus inside tucks will be gold foil.</u></i></p>

Hi every one welcome to the Re-launch of Foleys playing cards.
We understand we were over ambitious with our first project, we were trying to pull out all the stops with are first kickstarter. We wanted top quality cards with gold stamping and customs gold seals.
We also planned to use debossed tuck boxes with gold stamping text and logos. We also wanted to use  gold foil in the inside of the tucks. Over ambitious right?
 
This doesn't mean we don't want this in the future. (That's where stretch goals come In )
 We are still using custom decks, tucks and seals.  We  will have high quality casino stock from uspcc bee collection as we want the cards to be high quality and durable for the user. 
 
We will still be using the same card designs and tucks and seal design, but they will be  printed with pentone PMS 871 ink. The gold on the cards and tucks will have gold ink the same with any gold on the design of this project and instead of 2,000 card printing, will be making just 1,000. This is all to keep better control of cost and keep the price down.  
 
So you maybe wondering about the debossing and gold stamping?
 
As I previously mentioned we will aim for this in our future projects as we feel this will make us stand out.
Our stretch goals will be as follows

Gold stamped seals (this will be 40p per seal) 1,000 is £1400
 MetalLuxe for backs of cards (this will be £9.16 per deck 1,000 is £9,160) Another printing of 500 more standard. will be another £170 making up to 1.500 prints a total off £4,870
Traditional cut 10p per deck
Crushed stock 500 pounds.

If your wondering how will you get the new updates from the standard design. Don't worry it will be automatically changed to any goals we reach with no extra cost.. 
Are standard Print including custom tucks, seals and cards will be

 1,000 decks: £4,02 per deck, a total of £3.920 unless stretch goal is reached, then another 500 will be added.
The casino stock is included in the price above
Double backer for double lifts
Card design.

We have used Arrco face card design for the fronts as people tend to like close to the original look. But we have changed some colors and added are little marks and fully redesigned the pips


 


Tucks.
The tucks will be a stander print. with no embossing or gold foil.
This will be a stretch goal, and this will be announced and added to the pledge page once is unlocked or close.

This will be the look of the tucks, plus inside tucks will be gold foil.
 
Finally the seal will be a standard print, with a gold print. But also as an unlockable, the gold print will be gold stamp

 
Thank you for you time.
Any questions please ask.
Please note shipment could be sooner.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks we take to embark ourselves on such a project are difficult, impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>1. Will we be in trouble with the North Korean state? We hope not, the board game is intended as a work of fiction and not meant to induce bad feelings to anybody, on the contrary! You as the Player will have fun and learn about all the interesting stories Western Media published so far about North Korea! We are not inventing anything new, simply we take everything we know about North Korea and offer it in a board game format!</p>
<p>2. Is there a demand for a board game about North Korea?

<p>Only if our Indiegogo campaign is successful we will be able to deliver this board game to your door steps, therefore we count on your message and any publicity you can make for this, to promote this board game and bring this vision above a mere Prototype, to an actual finished, mass manufactured product. Ohhhh and we have soo many plans, for further extensions, additional content, ways to Glorify the Supreme Leader that wins a game event......... soo much, really. There isn't enough space here to mention it all!</p>
<p><u>We have the board game <strong>fully done</strong> and played the Prototype a ton of times</u>!</p>
<p>It really is tons of fun and offers huge replayability -there is no way during one game to go through all the World Events - and really. Nothing feels better than being a Supreme Leader for the Night!! Just ask our girlfriends...</p>
<p>All we need to know is if YOU want us to really deliver this game to you. All you have to do is pledge to make it a reality.</p>

It really is tons of fun and offers huge replayability -there is no way during one game to go through all the World Events - and really. Nothing feels better than being a Supreme Leader for the Night!! Just ask our girlfriends...
All we need to know is if YOU want us to really deliver this game to you. All you have to do is pledge to make it a reality.
3. We need to cover the costs for printing and shipping all over the world. Depending on the demand, we might have to rework the art, discuss deals with additional printing companies and so on.
 

Other Ways You Can HelpMake some noise about this Campaign!!!! We need people to know that we as a human race are so, so, sooooo close to finally have a Board Game that makes you feel like a Supreme Leader!!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Creature Feature Quarterly vol. 3 for OSE...</h3>
<p>It has been a busy (and interesting) year for me. I have been getting a lot of commissioned work lately while still plugging away at my own monster-making efforts. And, I figured it's time to release a 3rd volume of Creature Feature Quarterly for the Old School Essentials fans.</p>
<p>In the past, I've used Kickstarter but this time I thought I would give IndieGoGo a try.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Backers will get to vote on what monsters make it into the new volume.</h3>
<p>I have selected 40+ monsters for you to vote on. I have compiled them all into a PDF which is available on DriveThruRPG and my Drive (links below). The PDF includes images of the creatures, some descriptive text and a general HD value. There is a link in the PDF that will take you to a poll over on my Patreon.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the PDF hosted on DriveThru:<br/><a href=""https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/327100/Creature-Feature-Quarterly-vol-3-OSE-SAMPLE-MONSTER-SELECTION"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/327100/Creature-Feature-Quarterly-vol-3-OSE-SAMPLE-MONSTER-SELECTION</a><br/>And my Drive if you prefer to use that:<br/><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmNlvDA6baOrSAMMG7N8GNgptp0_ixOv/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmNlvDA6baOrSAMMG7N8GNgptp0_ixOv/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>The final product will include 16 of the selected monsters. Each monster will get four pages each covering stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive Fluff including Descriptions, Lore, Ecology, Adventure Seeds and some ideas for memorable Loot.</li>
<li>Paper Mini designs for EVERY monster! Designed for easy print and play so you can easily get them on your table quick!</li>
<li>VTT tokens for EVERY monster if you prefer to play your oldskool on Roll20, etc.</li>
<li>The PDF is formatted to be easily printed at home on A4 sheets as A5 facing pages. (DIY!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is very little risk of the project not reaching completion because it is a compilation of materials already published via my Patreon. And IGG backers get to select which of the potential monsters get into the new collection. The only hurdle is getting it all laid out in LibreOffice (which has been a bit buggy lately), but I think I can handle it. I have ran similar campaigns in the past with no problems.</p>

<p><strong>Hack and Dash is a two-player card game that feels like a board game, ready to go right out of the box. Instead of using a bulky game board, this portable game uses cards to randomly create one for you. Making games feel fresh and unique each time you play!</strong></p>
<p>Set moments after clearing a fabled dungeon, whose name has been forgotten by time, you'll command a band of heroes through diverse landscapes as they return home to their faction's guild hall.

<p><strong>(c)</strong> Be the player with the highest score if the <i><strong>Action</strong></i> deck runs out of cards.

<p>Hello! My name is Anthony Marimpietri, one of the co-founders of Moon Gear Games LLC. I grew up through the nineties and early 2000s playing many different table top games. Games including <strong>Magic the Gathering</strong>, <strong>Pokemon</strong> (<i>the first few sets</i>), <strong>Dungeons and Dragons 3.5</strong>, <strong>Dragonball Z card game</strong> (<i>the version produced by Score Entertainment</i>), <strong>Mage Knight</strong> and Decipher's <strong>Star Wars Customizable Card Game</strong>.  After being honorably discharged from service in late 2013, I have passed my time by developing and tinkering with Hack and Dash and other games.</p>
<p>Michael Collins, another co-founder of Moon Gear Games LLC, has known me for nearly 16 years. His background is in the trucking industry (<i>local deliveries and OTR</i>) and having served in the US Navy in supply. He's been invaluable to the project by asking the right questions concerning our logistical needs. In his spare time he enjoys playing strategy games (<strong>Axis and Allies</strong>) and city builder games.</p>

<p>Our <strong>Perks</strong> currently include delivering one copy, two copies or four copies of the game to you. We want the game to stand on its own merit and quality. If you have any reasonable ideas for <strong>Perks</strong> you'd like us to offer, please share with us and we'll look into what we can do on our end.</p>
<p>Each copy of the game will include 90 digitally printed, poker sized game cards on 12pt stock (<i>similar to the durability and feel of many card games on the market, like Magic the Gathering or Force of Will</i>), a set of rules and a tuck box for storage.

<p>Whether this campaign is successful or not, this entire experience has impacted us over the past few years. We've learned a lot along the way and brought it this far.

<p> </p>
<p>Crowd funding by nature has elements of risk, both seen and unseen. This applies to us and you as a potential backer. Let us outline the risks from our end.</p>
<ol>
<li>The game's illustrations and graphic designs are not 100% complete</li>
<li>Complications during production</li>
<li>Complications with delivery</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution to Risk #1</strong></p>
<p>In March, we had up to that point completed the card frames and the illustration sketches. With these elements available, we were able to have a quality control print run made. Ten test decks were  manufactured in this run. After checking for how the colors came out and the quality of the card stock, we were able to formulate a time table for the remaining illustrations/graphic design components. The plan currently is to have these components finished by late June 2019/early July 2019. As pieces of finished illustrations are completed, we'll update our backers accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution to Risk #2</strong></p>
<p>Production delays and manufacturing defects are a reasonable thing to worry about once the design files leave our hands. If there are any delays, we'll notify our backers as soon as we are made aware of them. With regards to manufacturing defects, we'll work through each issue on a case by case basis to adequately correct any problems that may arise.</p>
<p><strong>Solution to Risk #3</strong></p>
<p>Package loss and address changes are a reasonable thing to worry about once the manufactured games have been passed from <strong>Superior POD</strong> to their shippers. In regards to package loss, get us involved. We'll work with <strong>Superior POD</strong> to either locate your package or supply a replacement. As far as address changes, we ask that our backers keep us informed with accurate addresses so packages are not sent to the wrong location.</p>

</div></div>","Hack and Dash is a two-player card game that feels like a board game, ready to go right out of the box. Instead of using a bulky game board, this portable game uses cards to randomly create one for you. Making games feel fresh and unique each time you play!
Set moments after clearing a fabled dungeon, whose name has been forgotten by time, you'll command a band of heroes through diverse landscapes as they return home to their faction's guild hall. Be careful out there, as you'll be challenged by opposing heroes looking to seize your treasure for themselves!
Players will begin by separating the cards in the box.

Then each player receives a set of hero cards (Ebony or Ivory).

Next each player will choose one of the four unique guild halls to represent the faction of thier heroes.

Then the game board is assembled. After which play will begins!

Players will then take turns back and forth playing action cards from their hands in order to move their heroes along the game board.

When playing an action card, the number of white pearls printed on it denotes how far a hero can be moved. These pearls are located to the right of the art window on the action card's face.

Play continues like this until a player has achieved one of three possible win conditions.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are the creators of simulation games for corporations (octigo.net). Our typical games teach how to cooperate effectively in business. However, we noticed that sometimes this effort is futile. It is sometimes impossible to keep sanity in some organizations and nothing can improve this situation. </p>
<p>So we came up with an idea of a game, which does not teach at all, but allows for a moment to relax and feel comfortable knowing that others are in a worse situation than ours. So we created the Weasel card game.</p>
<h3>What Is The Weasel Game</h3>
<p>The game usually lasts for 30-50 minutes and it can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players. To play with 3 or 4 players you need to have 2 sets of cards.</p>
<p>How to play. The Weasel Game has only a few rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the first stage, you place two randomly selected stakeholders cards on the table.</li>
<li>Each round you and your opponent place an event card. They must match proper colors printed on the sides of each card.</li>
<li>After 5 rounds the players calculate the amount of points collected by each stakeholder.</li>
<li>Some cards have special abilities.</li>
<li>After finishing 5 rounds the second stage begins, in which we follow the same steps as in the first stage.</li>
<li>The game is over after completing 3 stages. Then all players count points of collected stakeholders.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483522838/cvbnqwzfnxc2x0syrkya.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Above you can see example of game play (two piles of card around two stakeholders).</p>
<h3>Why We Launched The Campaign</h3>
<p>We would like to collect funding to translate the game into English with the help of a professional translator, print an English version of the cards and boxes, and arrange online distribution along with some promotion.</p>
<p>The game is already prepared and tested as a prototype. We are currently developing hand made drawings for each card and edit fluff texts for them in Polish.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We offer you early access to the game, in PDF file, as soon as it is translated and once it is printed in paper form. The Weasel Game will be distributed in hard boxes containing two decks of event cards (72 cards in total) and 14 cards of stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As any other project, obstacles can arise unexpectedly. Potential set-backs may include production delays, shipping and sourcing problems. To minimize possible risks or unexpected issues, we are spending months researching, designing and testing, prior to launching prototypes.</p>
<p>Current status of the project is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We prepared and tested the prototype of the game</li>
<li>We have 50% of subtitles for the cards already prepared </li>
<li>We have about 60% of drawings ready</li>
<li>We have an offer of a printing company for printing cards</li>
<li>We have a couple of ideas regarding a box for card decks, we still need to pick the best one</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next two months, we will finish the subtitles and artwork, and print the Polish version of the decks. Then we are going to test them, again. </p>
<p>Please also note, that the final product colors and design may slightly vary from the renders shown in the project description.</p>

<h2>Kavac's Bag of Fate:</h2>
<p>Kavac's Bag of Fate is a small pouch with a leather strap that belonged to Kavac, the God of Trickery. He left his bag in the world of Ukodor for travelers to find it. When you look inside the bag you see nothing. From the outside, it appears to be a small Bag of Holding. If you reach into the pouch, you feel a deck of cards. The deck holds 20 tarot cards, once a card is drawn, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. Once a creature picks up this magical item, they are bound to it. If you try to get rid of the pouch, it will reappear on your side. Only The Plague or The Wish card may remove the deck, but it must be given to someone else.</p>
<p>While holding the deck, you may pull 1 card every dawn. If you hesitate to draw a card, you must succeed an Int DC 15 save or you pick a card anyway. If another person attempts to pull the deck away from you, they too must succeed the same save or pick a card. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. The owner of the deck may willingly offer another player to pull a card from the deck.</p>
<h3>Story:</h3>
<p>This item was created to use in the Realms of Ukodor D&amp;D 5e stream on Mixer. The overwhelming feedback we received is why this item is now available to the public. There are many magical items out there that could make or break your home game. The purpose of this deck is to add story elements to your game without totally breaking the campaign or story. Much like everything else in 5e elements of this magical item can be tailored to fit your house rules. We hope you enjoy.</p>

<h2>
<br/>WHY I Launch This Project?</h2>
<p><i>Hello everyone,</i></p>
<p>We're <strong>Minh Tran</strong> (Alex, a 30+ Tabletop Games Lover/Maker, a Digital Marketer, also a Father of a 6-month daughter) and <strong>Quan Nguyen</strong> (Kzan, a 26+ Rapper &amp; talented Graphic Designer). We both started playing board games (chess, monopoly, magic cards, ...) quite soon since we were just children and over time, we have built up our big love on them. </p>
<p>Among board games I've ever played, I'm extremely into party card games (particularly Social Deduction genre: <i>Werewolf</i>, <i>Avalon</i>, <i>Coup</i>, ...) due to the strong connection &amp; interaction among players during the game. However, to be honest, I cannot find anything really crazy and fun enough for my parties &amp; family events.</p>
<p>So one day in 2018, when preparing for the summer trip with my friends, an idea suddenly flashed through my mind, ""why not create a completely new party game myself, something can bring us lots of joyful moments during the holiday?""</p>
<p>That's how <i>Sick Pirate Mutiny</i> project was brewing at early stage ... </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Why This Game Is Extremely <u>FUN</u> And <u>UNIQUE</u>?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You must use both your BRAIN (memory &amp; guessing ability) and BODY (physical endurance) – it’s quite a CRAZY CHALLENGE!</p></li>
<li><p>You &amp; your friends will drink a lot (you can agree on WATER or ALCOHOL, it’s up to you), but are not allowed to go to the restroom!</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminated players can still actively participate in the game.</p></li>

<h2>Testimonials (What Others Say About This Game?)</h2>
<ul><li>
<strong>Jay Austin - <i>from United Kingdom</i></strong>: ""What I love about it is it's a very interactive game and that it's a nice quick filler party game. We laughed loads and I think most would play again in the future""</li></ul>

<ul><li>
<strong>Daniel Yocom - <i>from Utah, United State</i></strong>: ""We enjoyed your game! What people liked the most is the team play and the ability for even eliminated players to still be involved. There was much laughter while we played and I can say Sick Pirate Mutiny would have a better chance of being played than the Werewolf games""</li></ul>

<h2>The Game Story (That May INSPIRE You)</h2>
<p><i>Those who love thrilling stories about pirates during the 17th century, known as the Golden Age of Piracy, have probably heard of Blackbeard, an aggressive pirate ship frightening all merchants. But a few lucky sailors have been told Blackbeard’s biggest secret. It’s about a scary curse put on all Blackbeard’s crew, so they must forever suffer a defect in their bodies as punishment for their theft of Forbidden Treasures.</i></p>
<p><i>The only way to break the curse is for all crews to mutiny against Captain Sebastian Clark and his henchmen, then return all stolen treasures to beg for Blackbeard’s forgiveness…</i></p>

WHY I Launch This Project?
Hello everyone,
We're Minh Tran (Alex, a 30+ Tabletop Games Lover/Maker, a Digital Marketer, also a Father of a 6-month daughter) and Quan Nguyen (Kzan, a 26+ Rapper & talented Graphic Designer). We both started playing board games (chess, monopoly, magic cards, ...) quite soon since we were just children and over time, we have built up our big love on them. 
Among board games I've ever played, I'm extremely into party card games (particularly Social Deduction genre: Werewolf, Avalon, Coup, ...) due to the strong connection & interaction among players during the game. However, to be honest, I cannot find anything really crazy and fun enough for my parties & family events.
So one day in 2018, when preparing for the summer trip with my friends, an idea suddenly flashed through my mind, ""why not create a completely new party game myself, something can bring us lots of joyful moments during the holiday?""
That's how Sick Pirate Mutiny project was brewing at early stage ... 

 
Why This Game Is Extremely FUN And UNIQUE?

You must use both your BRAIN (memory & guessing ability) and BODY (physical endurance) – it’s quite a CRAZY CHALLENGE!
You & your friends will drink a lot (you can agree on WATER or ALCOHOL, it’s up to you), but are not allowed to go to the restroom!
Eliminated players can still actively participate in the game.


 
Testimonials (What Others Say About This Game?)

Jay Austin - from United Kingdom: ""What I love about it is it's a very interactive game and that it's a nice quick filler party game. We laughed loads and I think most would play again in the future""


Daniel Yocom - from Utah, United State: ""We enjoyed your game! What people liked the most is the team play and the ability for even eliminated players to still be involved. There was much laughter while we played and I can say Sick Pirate Mutiny would have a better chance of being played than the Werewolf games""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>If you enjoyed playing the board game of Monopoly, you will love playing the fast-dealing, fast-paced Travel Board Game of VACATION SPIN.  </strong></p>
<p>I'm Betty Deitch, Inventor of 2 U.S. Patented board games.  Vacation Spin, travel to 8 exotic destinations, with varying prices simulating real variables of travel.  Award winning Wall Street Spin game with varying prices, simulating ups and downs of the stock market.  My games have no dice, and spinner rotating around game board offers varying prices.  This is what is Unique!</p>
<p>My Passion is to travel.  My Dream is to make my Unique and Novel game become reality.  So as many people as possible can have fun playing this game of strategy with family and friends.  To encourage people to travel, or travel from home. You will be Spearheading this effort!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<u>What We Need and What I will do next</u><br/>Goal of $22,000 to manufacture 500 Unique and Novel games.  So you can have your Limited First edition!</h3>
<p>When I reach my goal, I will have a new launch of my sold out Wall Street Spin Board game, which plays very differently.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You would help bring my game come to Life!  I have worked long and hard on this.  Obtaining a U.S. Patent took a long time and was very expensive. Even Monopoly TM doesn't have a Patent.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonial:  ""Vacation Spin was a pleasure to play with friends.

<p><strong>Testimonial: ""I liked that the game provided competition and entertainment at the same time.  I think this game can also help bridge the generation gap.""  Ron D.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have a manufactured prototype of Vacation Spin board game, so this is ready to be manufactured by an expert company in China.  They specialize in board games.  Takes about 45 days to manufacture, because this is their busy season.</p>
<p>I've previously manufactured and sold 3,000 Wall Street Spin board games.</p>
<p>Only challenge is the freight forwarding costs from China to U.S., which are Increasing.  I do have monies to take care of this, if costs exceed my fundraising. Takes about 60 days to ship here.  I've allowed for extra time, so these should be delivered as Holiday gifts to you and friends!</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>You are with your loved ones on a sailboat spending a beautiful summer day. Suddenly you notice dark clouds approaching, and soon you are already in the middle of a stormy sea!

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the game a draw pile is created, containing trouble cards, surprise cards and six win cards. The pile is divided evenly among the players and placed face down on the table. All players also receive equipment cards, which they keep in their hands.</p>
<p>A timer is set at five minutes and all players draws the first card from the draw pile. All players play at the same time. Trouble cards represent problems with your boat’s gear, the weather or your crew. When drawing a trouble card, you need 1-3 equipment cards to solve the problem. You of course don’t have all the tools in your hand, so you will have to pass the equipment around to the right person. After solving the problem, the trouble card is moved to the discard pile and the player may take the equipment cards back into their hand.</p>
<p>As in real life, surprises are to be expected and interrupt the flow of the game through unexpected chores. These are represented by the surprise cards. Win cards are also mixed through the draw piles. Six win cards form a beautiful picture and ends the game.</p>
<p>Swapping cards requires hectic communication and will test your and your friends collaboration skills. Consideration for other players and good communication skills are required to play this game.<br/> </p>

The Origin Story
Fools at Sea was created by a group of entrepreneurial friends of the Junior Chamber International Airisto. When sailing through the unpredictable waters of the Finnish archipelago they realized: this would make an awesome game!
Beside fun and games, the Junior Chamber of Commerce aims to have a concrete impact on society. Through different projects it brings together the right people to solve problems and raise awareness. Examples of earlier projects include ‘Passion for the Baltic Sea’ to raise awareness of the dire situation of the sea’s water quality and the ‘Christmas tree collection’, collecting Christmas gifts for underprivileged kids. All activities are organized on a non-profit basis and on a voluntary basis.
JCI Airisto is active in a region spanning far around the city of Turku and into the Finnish archipelago. The archipelago is what makes this region unique, as it comprises 20,000 islands as well as a national park. This makes it the world’s most island-rich archipelago! 

Why Indiegogo, though?
As a non-profit organization involved in a wide range of societal issues, but not in the game industry, we missed the access to the right people. But we do know a lot of people who know people who know people. Some of them boating enthusiasts, others game enthusiasts. This makes Indiegogo an excellent opportunity to reach you who loves fun.

<h3>Watch our video above to see the latest prototype of Post Like POTUS: Hair Force One Edition. You'll see the unboxing, the words and names on each die, and some of the outrageous tweets the dice can make!</h3>
<div><div> </div></div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><strong>We know words. We have the best words. Now you can have them too!</strong></p>
<p>We've collected our new POTUS' best words , all of them the actual words that he's infamous for saying multiple times in multiple contexts. We're now turning the control of those words over to you, so you can create your own outrageous tweets and Post Like™ the Orange Twit™ Bird himself! Turn the Orange Twit Bird's words against him and his team, or you can use the blank stickers to write in the name of your own friends or enemies!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487632550/lzyoncafwnzp8uug0dkd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Play is simple and fun</strong>: Roll the dice to create your own almost-like-the-real-thing social media updates, and Post Like POTUS by posting the text and/or a picture of your dice roll to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. with the hashtag #PostLikePOTUS. You'll be able to search for that hashtag to see the posts created by others too!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487632599/urys71wx06rk8yflx54w.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>For even more fun</strong>, get your friends together and Match the Name! Remove the orange name die, and one player rolls all the other dice. She then reads aloud the post, substituting ""blank"" where the name would be, e.g. ""Overrated blank is a weak, worthless clown. Total disaster!"" All players then secretly write down the friend/enemy/co-worker/politician/etc. who best fits in the blank. The dice roller shows her answer and restates the post, filling in the blank with her answer. The other players each show their own answers in turn, also filling in the blank, and the dice roller wins one point for every answer that matches theirs! Play continues clockwise, so each person gets to roll and win points, and the high score wins! For more fun, try removing the blue noun/insult die instead! </p>
<p>(Suggested by a backer, not by us: If everyone in the game is of legal drinking age and not driving or parenting or operating heavy machinery or operating on humans/animals, then you <i>could</i> each pick your favorite word on the dice -- and every time your word is rolled, yell it out and take a drink! ""Putin!!!!!!!!"" [Always drink responsibly, folks, and absolutely never drink and drive!])</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487632652/ugpzwnwauxabsgsbcrnn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Post Like POTUS is a parody</strong> for entertainment purposes. We hope that's obvious, but we wanted to say it explicitly, in case there's any question about that. We're honestly, genuinely trying our best not to use any names as part of our branding that would get us in trouble legally. We and our playtesters think this little game is a riot, and we just want everyone on both sides of the aisle to have a small bit of fun in this political climate.</p>
<p>Post Like POTUS is being published by <a href=""http://PickleHopped.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pickle Hopped Games</a>. We are the indie game company behind the successfully-Kickstarted Dolly's Bookworm™ game that encourages children to love reading books, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MXDHS4S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pickhopp-20&amp;link_code=wql"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">now available at Amazon</a>. We've also published the patented card game that simulates the stock market, <a href=""http://MktMkr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Market Maker</a>®, used to train interns at a major financial services company.</p>
<p><strong>We've got experience </strong>designing, building, and publishing games - and in running successful crowdfunding campaigns that deliver what we promise to our supporters.</p>
<p>As you can see in our video, we've got the prototype done. We have determined the exact words and names to use and the number of blanks to include, and we've got all the component size and art details sorted out. We've got two confirmed quotes for printing from game printers that have a track record of successful delivery. Note that these games are being printed in China - just like POTUS' brand of shirts and eyeglasses as well as his hotels' pens, shampoo, body wash, moisturizers, shower caps, laundry bags, show bags, pet collars, pet leashes and bath towels!

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>We aren't in this to make a lot of money. We're in this to put smiles on the faces of people who are finding little to smile about in these dynamic times. Whether Democrat, Republican, Independent, or third-party, many of us agree that laughter can be empowering, therapeutic, and well, maybe able to bring us together even for a short while.</p>
<p><strong>Join us!</strong> Be a supporter by backing one of our perks and be the first to play Post Like POTUS: Hair Force One Edition! Who knows? If we're successful, maybe we'll be able to follow up later with Post Like Carlos Danger: Sexting Edition!</p>
<p>To help get the ball rolling, we're offering an essentially zero-profit game perk for the first backers of our campaign. Our MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail pricing) will be $29.95, and we're offering the regular game perks at more than 20% discount, just $24 including US shipping!</p>
<p>​As well, since play testers have really loved our Orange Twit Bird character, we've put him on exclusive t-shirts for this Indiegogo campaign. These are pretty funny, but they won't help us reach our goal of getting the game printed, so we're only offering them as add-on perks. Get them while you can!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want this campaign to have a bigger impact than just fun, though. These are serious times, so we want Post Like POTUS to make a difference, too. If we make our $5000 campaign goal, we will donate $1.00 for every backed game perk to your choice of charity!</p>
<p>One option is the ACLU Foundation, the <a href=""https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3247#.VrTM_bIrLIV"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">four-star-rated charity</a> of the <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (<a href=""https://twitter.com/ACLU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@ACLU</a>), who ""spearhead innovative and groundbreaking civil liberties litigation and public education"" and ""protect and defend the rights of millions of people across the nation."" Help us help others!</p>
<p>Another option is <a href=""https://www.rainn.org/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RAINN</a> (<a href=""https://twitter.com/RAINN01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@RAINN01</a>), ""the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization"", <a href=""https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=9947"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rated three stars by Charity Navigator</a>. The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network ""operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1.800.656.HOPE and rainn.org and publicizes the hotlines' free, confidential services; educates the public about sexual assault; and leads national efforts to prevent sexual assault...""</p>
<p>The third option is the <a href=""https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4207"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">four-star rated</a> <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Resource Defense Council</a> (<a href=""https://twitter.com/NRDC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@NRDC</a>). From their mission statement: ""We strive to protect nature in ways that advance the long-term welfare of present and future generations. We work to foster the fundamental right of all people to have a voice in decisions that affect their environment."" </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To be successful, we need to raise enough to print at least 500 copies of this game. The large dice are the biggest expense at about $0.75 each or ~$4.25 for the six. Add in the box, instruction manual, stickers, printing/boxing costs, shipping across the Pacific Ocean to an Amazon warehouse for fulfillment, then picking/packing/shipping to you, and the charges add up.</p>
<p>Our biggest risks are in the timeline. Printing games can take up to 3 months, and in our last campaign, our games were held up by the <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2015/02/14/386199926/west-coast-port-closures-are-hitting-several-industries-hard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2015 West Coast port closures</a>. Hopefully those issues won't affect us this time, but please forgive us if they do.</p>

All rights reserved.)</p></div>","Watch our video above to see the latest prototype of Post Like POTUS: Hair Force One Edition. You'll see the unboxing, the words and names on each die, and some of the outrageous tweets the dice can make!
 
Overview
We know words. We have the best words. Now you can have them too!
We've collected our new POTUS' best words , all of them the actual words that he's infamous for saying multiple times in multiple contexts. We're now turning the control of those words over to you, so you can create your own outrageous tweets and Post Like™ the Orange Twit™ Bird himself! Turn the Orange Twit Bird's words against him and his team, or you can use the blank stickers to write in the name of your own friends or enemies!

Play is simple and fun: Roll the dice to create your own almost-like-the-real-thing social media updates, and Post Like POTUS by posting the text and/or a picture of your dice roll to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. with the hashtag #PostLikePOTUS. You'll be able to search for that hashtag to see the posts created by others too!

For even more fun, get your friends together and Match the Name! Remove the orange name die, and one player rolls all the other dice. She then reads aloud the post, substituting ""blank"" where the name would be, e.g. ""Overrated blank is a weak, worthless clown. Total disaster!"" All players then secretly write down the friend/enemy/co-worker/politician/etc. who best fits in the blank. The dice roller shows her answer and restates the post, filling in the blank with her answer. The other players each show their own answers in turn, also filling in the blank, and the dice roller wins one point for every answer that matches theirs! Play continues clockwise, so each person gets to roll and win points, and the high score wins! For more fun, try removing the blue noun/insult die instead! 
(Suggested by a backer, not by us: If everyone in the game is of legal drinking age and not driving or parenting or operating heavy machinery or operating on humans/animals, then you could each pick your favorite word on the dice -- and every time your word is rolled, yell it out and take a drink! ""Putin!!!!!!!!"" [Always drink responsibly, folks, and absolutely never drink and drive!])

Post Like POTUS is a parody for entertainment purposes. We hope that's obvious, but we wanted to say it explicitly, in case there's any question about that. We're honestly, genuinely trying our best not to use any names as part of our branding that would get us in trouble legally. We and our playtesters think this little game is a riot, and we just want everyone on both sides of the aisle to have a small bit of fun in this political climate.
Post Like POTUS is being published by Pickle Hopped Games. We are the indie game company behind the successfully-Kickstarted Dolly's Bookworm™ game that encourages children to love reading books, now available at Amazon. We've also published the patented card game that simulates the stock market, Market Maker®, used to train interns at a major financial services company.
We've got experience designing, building, and publishing games - and in running successful crowdfunding campaigns that deliver what we promise to our supporters.
As you can see in our video, we've got the prototype done. We have determined the exact words and names to use and the number of blanks to include, and we've got all the component size and art details sorted out. We've got two confirmed quotes for printing from game printers that have a track record of successful delivery. Note that these games are being printed in China - just like POTUS' brand of shirts and eyeglasses as well as his hotels' pens, shampoo, body wash, moisturizers, shower caps, laundry bags, show bags, pet collars, pet leashes and bath towels! (fact check)
 

Our Campaign
We aren't in this to make a lot of money. We're in this to put smiles on the faces of people who are finding little to smile about in these dynamic times. Whether Democrat, Republican, Independent, or third-party, many of us agree that laughter can be empowering, therapeutic, and well, maybe able to bring us together even for a short while.
Join us! Be a supporter by backing one of our perks and be the first to play Post Like POTUS: Hair Force One Edition! Who knows? If we're successful, maybe we'll be able to follow up later with Post Like Carlos Danger: Sexting Edition!
To help get the ball rolling, we're offering an essentially zero-profit game perk for the first backers of our campaign. Our MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail pricing) will be $29.95, and we're offering the regular game perks at more than 20% discount, just $24 including US shipping!
​As well, since play testers have really loved our Orange Twit Bird character, we've put him on exclusive t-shirts for this Indiegogo campaign. These are pretty funny, but they won't help us reach our goal of getting the game printed, so we're only offering them as add-on perks. Get them while you can!
!

 

The Impact
We want this campaign to have a bigger impact than just fun, though. These are serious times, so we want Post Like POTUS to make a difference, too. If we make our $5000 campaign goal, we will donate $1.00 for every backed game perk to your choice of charity!
One option is the ACLU Foundation, the four-star-rated charity of the American Civil Liberties Union (@ACLU), who ""spearhead innovative and groundbreaking civil liberties litigation and public education"" and ""protect and defend the rights of millions of people across the nation."" Help us help others!
Another option is RAINN (@RAINN01), ""the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization"", rated three stars by Charity Navigator. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network ""operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1.800.656.HOPE and rainn.org and publicizes the hotlines' free, confidential services; educates the public about sexual assault; and leads national efforts to prevent sexual assault...""
The third option is the four-star rated National Resource Defense Council (@NRDC). From their mission statement: ""We strive to protect nature in ways that advance the long-term welfare of present and future generations. We work to foster the fundamental right of all people to have a voice in decisions that affect their environment."" 
 

Risks & Challenges
To be successful, we need to raise enough to print at least 500 copies of this game. The large dice are the biggest expense at about $0.75 each or ~$4.25 for the six. Add in the box, instruction manual, stickers, printing/boxing costs, shipping across the Pacific Ocean to an Amazon warehouse for fulfillment, then picking/packing/shipping to you, and the charges add up.
Our biggest risks are in the timeline. Printing games can take up to 3 months, and in our last campaign, our games were held up by the 2015 West Coast port closures. Hopefully those issues won't affect us this time, but please forgive us if they do.
The t-shirts will be printed by CafePress, which has a multi-year history of delivering custom-printed products quickly and with high quality. We've successfully used them ourselves for our popular Scientific Methodists line of merchandise that celebrates science, scientists, and the scientific method.
In short, with our prototype in hand and the artwork 80% completed, if we make our funding goal, we're 100% confident we'll be able to fulfill all the perks!

 
What Happens If We Don't Make Our Goal?
If you all have backed our perks, but we just barely miss our goal amount, we'll do our best to cover the difference ourselves, bring Post Like POTUS to life anyway, and fulfill your perks. If for whatever reason, we aren't even close to our goal, then we'll gladly/sadly refund your perk money (minus any fees we incurred). Hopefully this won't be a problem, and instead we'll be printing and fulfilling thousands of games for all of you!

<p><strong>SHORT SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>• About the creator of the game:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Anatoly Sloyko and I'm the developer of this game. I live in Kiev, Ukraine. I studied philosophy at the Kiev-Mohyla Academy. All my life I am an artist. I have done various installations and projects in various galleries and art-centers around the world. For example, in London at the Kinetic Art Fair, I exhibited the “Mahatmaplane” installation (another name “Balance”) - a four-winged flight simulator. Etc. Also I have a lot of experience as a creator and copywriter in various advertising agencies. Was engaged in the development of computer games as game designer.</p>
<p>Since my childhood I was admired by people who are able to bring something new into the world. Change the world. It is desirable, for the better. I, too, strive to be such a person. And I'm grateful to people who support cool ideas. Including mine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522261269/obdfoe0hycd0pmprtfzg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/><strong>• The Campaign:</strong></p>
<p>We offer you a completely new type of board game. It can be as mass market as, for example, Alias, but at the same time it affects essentially deeper layers of human perception. The essence of the game in the competition for the best explanation of human qualities with the help of cards (405), a 12-gaming game cube and special modal cards (36), which allow to explain this or that quality from the position of God, chaos, evolution, superman, guru, fool, an alien, and so on. In the game, we actively use such topical concepts as ""singularity"", ""neural network"", ""AI"" etc. Disassembly of a human is a useful activity and a lot of fun. After all, living in the world of high technologies and creating an artificial mind, we, people, have not understood ourselves properly yet.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522328817/vcpyiafkemkzxhyqpioi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong>• Magnitude of what contributors will help us achieve:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the goal to deliver to you as users of this game the maximum emotions and intellectual pleasure from the analysis of contradictory human qualities, i.e. we have 2 missions:<br/>• 1. <strong><u>Scientific research</u></strong>, through which it is possible to compile a ""Map of Human Qualities"" which are located in different segments, depending on the priority and vector of application. Here, each player can view himself as an element of the world neural network conducting this research.</p>
<p><br/>• 2. <u><strong>AI educating.</strong></u>  Approximately realizing the dynamics of growth of AI capabilities, we see our mission in teaching neuro-networks moral and ethical categories on the example of analysis of both positive and negative human qualities. To the most powerful artificial mind clearly understood why watching a bloody action movie, people going out into the street quietly go about their business, and not imitate the heroes of such a film. We want to show to the AI true human personality ​​in all its multidimensionality.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Also this game is definitely useful for:</strong></li></ul>
<p>• Courses of acting,<br/>• Psychological and psychoanalytic groups,<br/>• Intellectual and philosophical clubs (circles)<br/>• Language courses<br/>• Education of adolescents<br/>• Spiritual practices aimed at self-knowledge and transformation<br/>• Intellectual development<br/>• Courses of rhetoric<br/>• Family leisure</p>

<ul><li><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></li></ul>
<p>In order to release this game with a circulation of 1,000 copies, it is necessary to collect about 20,000 thousand dollars. Thus, each game will be in a beautiful and durable wooden box, with all the necessary attributes. Having established the production of the first game of the game - all copies of which will certainly go to our Bakers - we will be able to improve and reduce the cost of production, in order to make this game more popular and accessible in every country and every family.</p>

<ul><li>Please, look up for our updates. We've got some nice surprises - add-ons for you!</li></ul>
<p><i>If the fundraising bar is not reached - then this game will be released anyway, just in a smaller number of copies.</i></p>
<ul><li><strong>The Impact</strong></li></ul>
<p>• For everyone who will support this game in the first place, it will benefit as a valuable tool for self-knowledge and self-improvement. As already said in the era of the development of artificial intelligence, people around the world would not be in a better position to know themselves: in all their glory and versatility of their qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps this clever and fun game will give people more knowledge about themselves than tons of books on philosophy and psychology.</strong></p>
<p><br/>• We already have a ready-made prototype of the game and also positive feelings from its testing in different groups of people. (After which many people ask when it will be possible to play again?). And we are only at the beginning of this great experiment. Let's do it together!</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></li></ul>
<p>Perhaps the main obstacle is that this game is developed in Ukraine. What makes the delivery is relatively expensive. Whether this game was created in California, probably there would not be problems as such. But still in this, at first glance, the distance (at least from the US) there are pluses. For example, the availability of relatively cheap and skilled production. We will not order the details of the game in China. Maybe just a glowing cube and a magnetic hourglass). We will make efforts to produce these elements here in Ukraine. The advantage of our situation is the proximity of the European market with a large audience of intelligent and advanced consumers.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></li></ul>
<p>This game, thanks to the illustrated cards with descriptions - is among other things also something like a book. Each of the 36 modal cards is devoted to one of the key concepts, essences or archetypes in the consciousness of modern man. Some of them seemed to be eternal. Some, such as ""matrix"" or ""singularity"" appeared relatively not long ago. This game is an excellent opportunity to replenish your thrift-box with actual memes and concepts. Therefore, we plan to create a few more special cards in the course of the company, which were stored in a post-pause order to indulge or irritate your imagination. We will be grateful to you for the repost of this project on IndiGoGo. Make some buzz about us, please!</p>

The essence of the game in the competition for the best explanation of human qualities with the help of cards (405), a 12-gaming game cube and special modal cards (36), which allow to explain this or that quality from the position of God, chaos, evolution, superman, guru, fool, an alien, and so on. In the game, we actively use such topical concepts as ""singularity"", ""neural network"", ""AI"" etc. Disassembly of a human is a useful activity and a lot of fun. After all, living in the world of high technologies and creating an artificial mind, we, people, have not understood ourselves properly yet.

Here, each player can view himself as an element of the world neural network conducting this research.
• 2. AI educating.  Approximately realizing the dynamics of growth of AI capabilities, we see our mission in teaching neuro-networks moral and ethical categories on the example of analysis of both positive and negative human qualities.

The Impact
• For everyone who will support this game in the first place, it will benefit as a valuable tool for self-knowledge and self-improvement. As already said in the era of the development of artificial intelligence, people around the world would not be in a better position to know themselves: in all their glory and versatility of their qualities.
Perhaps this clever and fun game will give people more knowledge about themselves than tons of books on philosophy and psychology.
• We already have a ready-made prototype of the game and also positive feelings from its testing in different groups of people. (After which many people ask when it will be possible to play again?). And we are only at the beginning of this great experiment. Let's do it together!
 
Risks & Challenges
Perhaps the main obstacle is that this game is developed in Ukraine. What makes the delivery is relatively expensive. Whether this game was created in California, probably there would not be problems as such. But still in this, at first glance, the distance (at least from the US) there are pluses. For example, the availability of relatively cheap and skilled production. We will not order the details of the game in China. Maybe just a glowing cube and a magnetic hourglass). We will make efforts to produce these elements here in Ukraine. The advantage of our situation is the proximity of the European market with a large audience of intelligent and advanced consumers.
Other Ways You Can Help
This game, thanks to the illustrated cards with descriptions - is among other things also something like a book. Each of the 36 modal cards is devoted to one of the key concepts, essences or archetypes in the consciousness of modern man. Some of them seemed to be eternal. Some, such as ""matrix"" or ""singularity"" appeared relatively not long ago. This game is an excellent opportunity to replenish your thrift-box with actual memes and concepts. Therefore, we plan to create a few more special cards in the course of the company, which were stored in a post-pause order to indulge or irritate your imagination. We will be grateful to you for the repost of this project on IndiGoGo. Make some buzz about us, please!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Sock Monsters - a Card Game For Creative Kids</h3>
<p>Hi, we are Sam and Rotem, Rotem and Sam, the two grown-up sock monsters.</p>
<p>We are parents, game-designers, game players and teachers.</p>
<p>After many years working in the digital game world, Sock Monsters is our first physical card game for children. It is also our first crowdfunding project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522345809/vikbaazg58mojjcrvvqp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story of Sock Monsters started as an idea for parents and for children to share a creative experience.  We wanter families to use the basic story as a starter for creating their own stories. We had  many tries and errors in the way we presented the Sock Monsters story. Eventually, we made the story into a card game because we believe in active story telling, where children can create their own plot and change it with every single round of play.</p>
<p>The Sock Monsters is also about diversity: there are 10 of them, each with their own unique character. They do have one thing in common though: their passion for socks.  </p>

<p>The game is quite simple: deal 5 cards per player; start drawing cards from the deck; get a monster to start collecting socks; win by collecting 5 socks of the same color.</p>

<h3>A Game That Socks</h3>
<p>After many years in the gaming industry and as startup entrepreneurs, we slowly developed a concept for story-based games and experiences. We called it g!animo. Sock Monsters is the first game under this concept. </p>
<p>We started g!animo as a fun project several years ago. We wanted to create a different way to let parents and children tell stories. This is why we created stories and characters and printed them on wall decals. It didn't go very well, but we didn't let it get us down. We started playing with one of the stories, Sock Monsters, and it soon found its own direction: a card game.</p>
<p>It took us several months, over 200 playtests and many drafts and sketches, to declare the design of the first version as done.</p>
<p>Sock Monsters is the first attempt in creating a game from one of our 4 different children's stories. Its success will mean that we can develop more games and more activities out of these stories. It means the world to us. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>When Granny Yarn, the wrinkliest sock monster in Under-The-Bed-Town, gathered all the young sock monsters together for a bedtime story, little did she know how much trouble it would cause.  </p>
<p>She opened her great book of legends to the very last tale, and told a story she hadn’t told for a very long time. It was the legend of Draweria – a mythical land where bright clean socks are laid in pairs – as many as a sock monster could ever eat. Stripy ones and spotty ones, frilly ones and fluffy ones – Draweria had them all! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522774328/eophc3j8elodcclcigq7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>The young sock monsters drooled at the thought. “Wow,” gasped William. “Can we go there?” “Of course not” said MathU. “It’s just a story. It’s highly improbable it even exists.” “Let’s go anyway!” cried Yum and Mee. “No-one is going anywhere tonight!” said Granny Yarn. “Goodnight little monsters.” she blew them kisses and turned off the light. But the little sock monsters were too excited to sleep. <br/>“Frilly socks,” sighed Lola, “I’ve always wanted to be frilly.” <br/>Here, we should probably explain that whenever a sock-monster gobbles up a sock, they immediately take on the appearance of the sock they have just eaten.<br/>Boo, is all inside-out and smelly after eating a dirty old sock by mistake. “I think we should leave immediately.” He said. <br/>“Me Too!” said one of Molly’s heads. “Me Three!” said the other. And so they all set out with only the words of Granny Yarn’s book to guide them:</p>
<p>״Through the valley of the toys,</p>
<p>Go towards the tick-tock noise.</p>
<p>Cross the rug a mile wide,</p>
<p>Climb the cupboard’s slippery side.</p>
<p>And when peggies come in site,</p>
<p>Don’t let them give you a fright.״</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>When we meet the goal, or hopefully exceed it, we will be able to manufacture the game at Ad Magic's facility. The funds collected will also finance the shipment to backers in the US. International backers will have to add the difference for shipment when backing the project. </p>
<p>The funds we request are only the funds required to manufacture and to ship the product. Here is how the funds will be allocated when we just meet the goal:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522774344/nhdtnaclcmjww7e0r0t7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we will exceed the requested goal, the pie chart will change: a larger percentage will be allocated for fulfillment, we will also be able to cover other expenses, and of course: we may even have enough funds to create more products and to manufacture further editions of the game. </p>
