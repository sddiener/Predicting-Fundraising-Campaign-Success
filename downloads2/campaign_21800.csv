Hi, we are David and Annalisa, co-founders of Little Tree Theatre. 
Little Tree grew out of talks we had while producing a collaborative piece titled MisShapen, first at the Long Beach Playhouse, and then again when the show was remounted at the Hollywood Fringe Festival.  We both believe that art and storytelling are essential to what defines us as human beings.  Catharsis through story makes us stronger, wiser and more empathetic.  We become curious and imaginative, we become more human.
We realized there are so many incredible designers, performers, directors, writers and producers in our community that are capable of amazing work, but just need the opportunity and support to hone their craft and share it with the world.
Our Mission: Little Tree Theatre strives to create and share art with its community by creating opportunities for emerging artists to explore new work.  Together we grow.

March 14, the sprinkler system in one of our company studios unexpectedly malfunctioned
and ran for 40 minutes. Fire trucks rushed to the Hubbard Street Dance Center
in response to the alarm, and our building — which houses the company,
administrative offices, the Lou Conte Dance Studio, our costume shop, storage
and archives — was completely evacuated. While fortunately there was no fire, thousands
of gallons of water flooded into a large area of our second floor, damaging Studios
B, C, and D. More than 50 classes had to be canceled during the following week, while temporary flooring for Studios B
and C was secured and installed. We have been working hard to expedite renovations to get the Hubbard
Street Dance Center fully up and running again, but the damage is extensive and
significant. However, this could be an opportunity to improve multiple aspects
of our facility, beyond repairing those affected by the flood — and that’s
where you come in!<br/>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Many people are asking...</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How Can I Help?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>To
help get us back to serving thousands of students, artists, and audiences each
week, we are asking for <i>your</i> help to rebuild
the Hubbard Street Dance Center. Our campaign goal is $25,000, which will cover
repairs going beyond what was immediately affected by the flood. Donations in
any amount are critical in helping us rebuild the Hubbard Street Dance Center,
so we may continue fulfilling our mission to change lives through dance.</p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Don't You Have Insurance?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Yes!
We have been working with our insurance agent to fast-track the process. We are
thankful that our insurance will cover some of the immediate damage from the flood, but there are several areas that insurance
will not cover. This includes repairing ceiling insulation, replacing carpets
and repairing damaged electricity.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Where Will the Money Go?<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The money raised
by this campaign will not only bring our studios back to full functionality, but
also better the facilities that are used by hundreds of students, professionals, and teaching artists each day. With your money we will be able to repair
ceiling insulation in two studios, add outlets in three studios, upgrade sound systems in all studios, repair our hydraulic lift, upgrade our faculty lounge, replace carpeting and more!  Take a closer look:</p>

B, C, and D. More than 50 classes had to be canceled during the following week, while temporary flooring for Studios B
and C was secured and installed. We have been working hard to expedite renovations to get the Hubbard
Street Dance Center fully up and running again, but the damage is extensive and
significant. However, this could be an opportunity to improve multiple aspects
of our facility, beyond repairing those affected by the flood — and that’s
where you come in!


Many people are asking...
   
How Can I Help?
 
To
help get us back to serving thousands of students, artists, and audiences each
week, we are asking for your help to rebuild
the Hubbard Street Dance Center. Our campaign goal is $25,000, which will cover
repairs going beyond what was immediately affected by the flood. Donations in
any amount are critical in helping us rebuild the Hubbard Street Dance Center,
so we may continue fulfilling our mission to change lives through dance.
  
Don't You Have Insurance?
 
Yes!
We have been working with our insurance agent to fast-track the process. We are
thankful that our insurance will cover some of the immediate damage from the flood, but there are several areas that insurance
will not cover. This includes repairing ceiling insulation, replacing carpets
and repairing damaged electricity.   
Where Will the Money Go?





The money raised
by this campaign will not only bring our studios back to full functionality, but
also better the facilities that are used by hundreds of students, professionals, and teaching artists each day. With your money we will be able to repair
ceiling insulation in two studios, add outlets in three studios, upgrade sound systems in all studios, repair our hydraulic lift, upgrade our faculty lounge, replace carpeting and more!  Take a closer look:



Why Is This Important?
 

Hubbard Street Dance Chicago has served the Chicago community as a non-profit organization for over 38 years. Your
donation to Help Rebuild the Hubbard Street Dance Center will allow us to
continue reaching thousands of people across Chicago and beyond. Hubbard Street
offers more than 70 public classes each
week at the Lou Conte Dance Studio, reaches nearly 100,000 people each year
with our performances and programs, gives more than 75 performances each year, collaborates
with diverse partner institutions in Chicago and beyond, brings our
field-leading Education Programs into more than 30 Chicago Public Schools, offers
professional development opportunities to teachers, and serves young dancers
with autism and people with Parkinson’s disease through Adaptive Dance Programs.

Your
donation will improve the space we use to enrich and transform the lives of
hundreds of thousands of people through dance. I've Donated! Now What? 



Outstanding!
Your support is greatly appreciated. You will receive an email at the conclusion of the campaign with information on how to claim your perk.

<p>    In
the late 1950's and 60's, a sound quietly blew throughout Detroit,Michigan. It
was a sound full of BODY and SOUL. The sound seemed to hover over the city. It
worked it's way into the very SOUL of the people. Magically, some of the people
began to produce SONGS and DANCES from this SOUND. There were well known groups
that emerged from the Motor City, with names like The Temptations, The
Contours, The Four Tops, The Velvelettes and The Originals.</p>
<p>    What
was truly amazing was how quickly young and old became captivated by this
soulful music. In a matter of a few months a competition was built which
centered around which groups were most soulful, had the better voices, rhythms
and songs. The groups became more creative and their talent was on full
display. The competition was fierce and almost unrealistic, but like anything
else, GOD took over and put his power and spirit in the very group everyone
counted out.</p>
<p>    This
group, led by their youngest member was called The Dramatics. They were just
infants in the business when they experienced their first hit record.
Nevertheless, their youth did not stop their fight to the top. They mastered
the challenges of surviving in the difficult and tempting music business, and through
it all, Ron Banks and The Dramatics triumphed for over three decades. They
overcame every trial and tribulation the business could produce, all the while
keeping the fans satisfied.</p>
<p>    During
the lows of Show Business, one can't always see the upside or benefits of the
pursuit. However the benefits can be huge, and they are not just financial. The
Dramatic's Experience is a true story of their fight to the top in the
tumultuous music business. Their story has been captured in a 3 Act stage play
that will detail their their lives, their struggles, highs and lows, all while
laced with The Dramatic's great music.</p>
<p>    We
are seeking the support of friends, loved ones, fans, and anyone who loves
theater, The Dramatics, or just the sound of great soul music. This play is
designed to be an epic view of their lives and times. Your pledges will be
appreciated, and will go directly towards the production of the play.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>My story?</p>
<p>I decided to make a theatre show called Marlene – The Competition<br/>to speak about important issues. I applied to the Arts Council in England for support and was turned down, but I didn’t give up. I fought for a year and step by<br/>step, with a little help from here and there I created and opened the show.  It ran for a week at Tristan Bates Theatre London, in Santa Barbara USA and in Budapest at the Katona Jozsef Theatre with great success.</p>
<p>You may have seen it or heard about it.</p>
<p>I applied again to Arts Council hoping that the work I have already put in will help to get some support from them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Arts Council turned me down again and that way my further plans.</p>
<p>I spent all my money on making the show and now has nothing left to invest for touring.</p>
<p>I’d like to bring it back to London for a proper 3 weeks run, because that’s the only way I can get press to review it. Without reviews, it's impossible to get industry attention. And the show will never be performed again.</p>
<p>Based on the positive feedback I had in London, California and Budapest, I’m here now, to ask your support, to be able keep playing my “Marlene” show. I feel it would be wrong to give up now.</p>
<p> Whatever amount, I am fortunate to receive, will help me to go ahead artistically, introduce my work in UK and create future work. </p>

I’d like to bring it back to London for a proper 3 weeks run, because that’s the only way I can get press to review it. Without reviews, it's impossible to get industry attention. And the show will never be performed again.
Based on the positive feedback I had in London, California and Budapest, I’m here now, to ask your support, to be able keep playing my “Marlene” show. I feel it would be wrong to give up now.
 Whatever amount, I am fortunate to receive, will help me to go ahead artistically, introduce my work in UK and create future work. 
If you would like to see examples of my work, and get to know me more as an artist visit my website, http://www.evamagyar.com/ 
 Thank you,

<p><b>Our Story</b></p><p>Hi! My name is Evan
Crommett and my co producer is Aleah Black. We're a writing/directing/producing
team. We're students in our junior year at Bard College in upstate New York.
Bard is where we met, and where I major in creative writing, Aleah in theater. </p><p><b>The Play</b></p>
<p>This campaign aims
to raise funds for the play we're writing, Hadeon. The play takes place within
a fantastical world, influenced in equal parts by Greek mythology,
Shakespearean plays, and the aesthetic of the 50s. This is a world where the
gods once existed, but have long been done away with. Through the actions of
King Argos, the cunning, immaculate leader of this world, a new god, Hadeon, is
born.</p>
<p><b>Our Needs</b></p><p>In the case of any
play, costuming, makeup, hair design, lighting, set construction, sound, technological
aspects, and publicity, require a great deal of time, energy, kind, hard-working
people, and of course, money. This is all the more the case, however, when the
play in question has the aesthetic demands of Hadeon.  All of the people who have agreed to act in,
tech, and design Hadeon have agreed to work for free. Because of this, all of
the money from the campaign will go to creating the world of the play. </p>
<p>It may sound
dramatic to say we're creating a new god and a new world, but that is, in fact,
the task at hand. Our actors are already on their way to making our world, and
the characters within it believable, but we require assistance in other ways to
bring this project to life.</p>
<p>Our goal is to use a
lot of found and ecofriendly materials to construct our show. That said, there
are specifics that we will need to purchase to successfully capture our
aesthetic. For example: sheets of recycled industrial grade plastic, an entire
1950s pastel wardrobe from thrift stores for thirteen people, props including throwing
knives, stilts, and a trampoline, sheet metal to construct crowns, and chicken
wire, wood, and spackle to create a giant egg from which a god is born.</p>
<p><b>The Importance</b></p><p>The project is very
is important to us for a number of reasons; in addition to the themes of love,
and power we've mentioned, the play explores themes too often deemed taboo,
such as class, and sexual liberation. The play functions, in many ways, as a
parody and investigation of an old cliché: the story of an ingénue striving to
kindle a romance with a gallant, ever-elusive male. This play, we feel, is not
just a story that can be told, but a story that needs to be told.</p><p>I’d also like to
point out the astoundingly positive reception, and overall success of Aleah's
previous theatrical endeavor, Wolf, a play she wrote, directed, and produced
last fall. It was entirely funded through indiegogo.</p>
<p><b>Your Contribution</b></p><p>Thank you so much
for supporting the two of us as student artists. The success of this project
will be a step in establishing ourselves in this community. Furthermore, it
will promote accessible, beautiful, and sustainable theater created by young
artists.  Lastly, please
share this page in any way you can! Posting it on Facebook, emailing it to
friends, talking to people about the show, sending out carrier pigeons, firing
arrows with rolled up scrolls through your friend's windows, whatever you can
do to spread the word, please do it! </p><p>Thank you for your contribution!</p>

We hear about so much negativity that we forget to enjoy the beauty around us. Everything around us has a story and I love bringing stories to life. In school, I was the child that was full of imagination. I went on to college and I studied journalism and television production. </p>
<p>I have written and directed several stage play productions, with the most recent production, Meet the New First Lady, including the talented Willie Taylor of Day 26 and recording artst Jerome Wiggins of the Tia and Tamera Show.  I want to do more. I want to bring to Movies with a message, productions with a purpose. </p>
<p>I started this campaign because no man is an island. I cannot do this alone but with your help I can bring my vision to life and make some actor's dream a reality. I would love to tour cities around the country and bring my productions to a city near you. I am asking for your help in making this possible. We need to cover travel expenses and production costs and your contribution can help us accomplish that. I know there are many out there that love the arts as much as I do, and I am asking that you help me bring the arts to cities beyond Los Angeles and New York. </p>
<p>Please join me on this journey and let's bring quality back onto our television screens, our movies screens and our stages.Your contribution would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div> <div> <h3>To Get Started</h3> <p>To get started we need to raise $5000.00 to cover the following costs:</p> <ul>
<li>Venue</li> <li>Travel expenses for a cast</li>
<li>Production costs for staging </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3> <ul>
<li>With your contribution we would be able to reach areas that have been overlooked when it comes to performing arts. Some of the most talented individuals of our time and past time have come from small towns and it would be great if we could give these talented individuals the opportunities to share their great talents with the world.</li> <li>To date, one of my most successful shows happened in a town near Dallas, called Garland. People want to come out and enjoy a stage play and they want it in their communities and I want to bring that to them. </li> <li>My parents are from small towns and I have family members living in towns that seek things to do on the weekend but they're limited because no one brings their shows to them. They deserve the enjoyment of seeing an entertaining show in their community. Everyone should be afforded that opportunity. The actors there should also have a chance to do what they love in the company of their family and friends and they should be given those same opportunities given to those in well known entertainment capitals.  </li> </ul>

</div></div>","Creativity is Beautiful! I am in love with creativity. We hear about so much negativity that we forget to enjoy the beauty around us. Everything around us has a story and I love bringing stories to life. In school, I was the child that was full of imagination. I went on to college and I studied journalism and television production. 
I have written and directed several stage play productions, with the most recent production, Meet the New First Lady, including the talented Willie Taylor of Day 26 and recording artst Jerome Wiggins of the Tia and Tamera Show.  I want to do more. I want to bring to Movies with a message, productions with a purpose. 
I started this campaign because no man is an island. I cannot do this alone but with your help I can bring my vision to life and make some actor's dream a reality. I would love to tour cities around the country and bring my productions to a city near you. I am asking for your help in making this possible. We need to cover travel expenses and production costs and your contribution can help us accomplish that. I know there are many out there that love the arts as much as I do, and I am asking that you help me bring the arts to cities beyond Los Angeles and New York. 
Please join me on this journey and let's bring quality back onto our television screens, our movies screens and our stages.Your contribution would be greatly appreciated.   To Get Started To get started we need to raise $5000.00 to cover the following costs: 
Venue Travel expenses for a cast
Production costs for staging  
  How You Can Help 
With your contribution we would be able to reach areas that have been overlooked when it comes to performing arts. Some of the most talented individuals of our time and past time have come from small towns and it would be great if we could give these talented individuals the opportunities to share their great talents with the world. To date, one of my most successful shows happened in a town near Dallas, called Garland. People want to come out and enjoy a stage play and they want it in their communities and I want to bring that to them.  My parents are from small towns and I have family members living in towns that seek things to do on the weekend but they're limited because no one brings their shows to them. They deserve the enjoyment of seeing an entertaining show in their community. Everyone should be afforded that opportunity. The actors there should also have a chance to do what they love in the company of their family and friends and they should be given those same opportunities given to those in well known entertainment capitals.   
  I have risked every dime I have and will continue to do so because I believe the performing arts can also uplift and inspire communities.

In 2014, the Barn Arts Collective started Chekhov Club - a community organization on Mount Desert Island in Maine that brings people together to read, discuss, and perform the work of Anton Chekhov.  Since then, Chekhov Club has met regularly and grown to include film projects, public events, and full productions of Chekhov's work.  This year, Barn Arts will launch the first ever Chekhov Festival.
 

The Chekhov Festival

The Barn Arts Chekhov Festival will be a celebration of the author's work that will share the spirit and camaraderie of Chekhov Club with the community through a major event this fall.  The lineup includes three full productions from artists based in Maine and New York, a festival of short films adapted from Chekhov short stories, and a public event at the Southwest Harbor Public Library inviting everyone to take part in Chekhov Club.

 
The Budget

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Avinoam Silverman.  I am a former National Ballet of Canada soloist and presently a freelance choreographer and ballet teacher.    I'm very excited to tell you about two new dance creations on which we are working entitled Anvil 18 and Shedding Eve.  These works will compose  a full dance evening program that will take place in Summer 2017 at the Dancemakers Center for Creation in Toronto.    </p>
<p>Anvil 18 is a 30 minute piece for 8 dancers.  This work can be viewed as especially meaningful since it takes an intimate look at the ballet world's emotional impact on its dancers.  The dancers and I are exploring different layers that construct the ballet world: dogmaticism; discipline; rigour; competition; beauty; passion; comradery; and humor.    We are digging  deeper into the way dancers feel inside the ballet world and giving expression to the range of feelings they experience such as frustration, joy, anger, sadness, helplessness, despair and excitement.  As I myself am a former ballet dancer, the critical aspects of the way this work tackles this complex subject stems from the deep respect I hold for the artistry and creativity of this art form. </p>
<p>We are using a wide range of movement vocabulary ranging from classical and neo classical to contemporary and more theatrical and thereby creating a unique world of exploration around our theme -  the inner world of dancers and the tension between the free expression of movement and dictated, restricted expressions of it.   We are striving to take ballet into uncharted territory and giving it a fresh twist which I think is very exciting. </p>
<p>Shedding Eve is a ten minute  solo work danced by Amy Hampton which is loosely based on  the story of Adam and Eve. The work examines our relationship to traditions and how we choose to move forward with our own lives making our own decisions.    The work looks at different aspects of ""Shedding"".  Just as a snake sheds its skin we are shedding different aspects of ourselves such as old political, religious, social beliefs and, our ever-changing physical body.  We are constantly   asking questions,  growing, learning and finding our own way.  In this solo work we are expressing  these processes and struggles.    The movement is contemporary and theatrical and we are using pieces of music that are very different from one  another to create a sharp changing of mood as an expression of our changing ideas.    This work is in a sense a journey towards our truth and how we decide to live our life free of ideas that no longer resonate with us.      </p>
<p>With your support you will help us bring these new works on to the stage and ultimately share it with you and our audience. </p>

<p>In the spring of 2015 I  used Indigogo in order to fund my first dance film titled <i>Diversion. </i>Our campaign was successful thanks to the generosity of all our backers.

<p>With opening up a new studio come quite a few costs. So, to help us help YOU become the strongest and happiest aerialist you can be, we’re reaching out and humbly asking for your help to make this dream come true for ALL of us, you included!</p>
<p>We appreciate any support you can offer!</p>
<p>We’ve set up a few ideas here, or....name your price!!! Name an amount, and let us know what you’d like in return, or if there’s something specific you’d like to sponsor at the Lab. We’re open to bartering!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now, we have the basics we need to get The Lab functioning, but in order to fully open our classes, we need to expand the number of apparatus we have hanging. We want our students to excel at a rate that is determined by their own learning pace and not be limited by equipment numbers. </p>

<p>Smaller donations will be pooled to assist us with the development costs of our first collaborative production with Del Corazon this winter! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is a limited offering and exposure to a wide variety of the aerial arts in both Nevada County and the Sacramento region in general. For both children and adults, learning the aerial arts can be a valuable way to develop a new relationship with your body and mind - to learn agility, to gain strength, to explore flexibility, to poke at our fears, and to increase confidence in ourselves.</p>
<p>At The Aerial Lab, we focus attention on the science behind movement. We want our students and fellow collaborators to have access to tools that encourage safe play, artistic development and a thorough understanding of physics and how the body moves in spacial suspension.</p>
<p>This way of approaching Aerial and Circus is a new movement, and we have connected to many aerialists in our industry in order to collaborate on this new way of thinking in the aerial world. We want to share it with you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As  with all new businesses, we proceed with great optimism, grand designs, and a healthy dose of well-informed market research. We have been working in this industry for a cumulative total of 20 years, between us we hold two business degrees and believe we have a recipe for solid instruction, industry advancement and artistic development. We hope to construct the framework for a local community that loves to play in the air with us, and provide wondrous and professional performances, locally and further afield.</p>
<p>Bringing this skillful offering to a small-ish county will certainly be more of a challenge than starting this business in a large city. However, Nevada County is progressive in the art world, and we are already connected to many aerialists who are seeking a training space. The only way is up!</p>
<p>Aerial Yoga has been growing in the past 5 years, but as yet there is no space offering classes in the Nevada County area. Since we have an abundance of yoga-lovers, we are offering a new way to enhance their practice or transition into the air.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Cave Painting Theater Company was
founded in 2012 by Gwen Kelly-Masterton and Heidi Mullins Lemieux as

with a growing focus on gender-bent and racially inclusive casting<b>.
</b>Now in our third season,
previous productions have included <i>The

<i>As You Like It. </i>We
tend to move around a lot, but <i>The
Tragedy Of Lear </i>will
take place on the West Stage of the Raven Theatre Complex in
Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood. You can check them out at

<p>
</p><p><i><b>What's
this “Tragedy of Lear” thing then, and don't we mean“King
Lear”?</b></i></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Sort of! <i>The Tragedy of Lear</i> is a completely gender-swapped
adaptation of Shakespeare's <i>King Lear, </i>starring Elizabeth
Kelly (<i>The Dark is Light Enough, As You Like It)</i> as Queen
Lear. It's a story of children and parents: three brothers who can't
agree on how to care for their increasingly confused and irascible
mother (and her kingdom) as she descends into dementia; and two
sisters, one the embarrassing result of a teen pregnancy and the
other the adored child of a legal marriage, locked in a lifelong
battle for their inheritance and their mother's love. <i>The Tragedy
Of Lear,</i>, which will run February 12-21 2015, is being
directed by CPTC Artistic Director Gwen Kelly-Masterton, and will
feature returning CPTC actors Gabriel Howard, Jesse Hutson, and Helen
Young as well as many exciting new faces.</p>
<p>
</p><p><i><b>Why
tell this story?</b></i></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
best tragedies, in our opinion, a) have humor in them and b) let the
audience leave wiser than they arrived, whether they see a cautionary
tale or gain insight into a “bad” person's emotional journey.
<i>Lear</i>
is a truly great tragedy; along with the exciting effects of
gender-swapping a well-known classic tragedy, which we talk about in
the video, our production will explore on a wide range of important
topics: sibling rivalry, a marriage disrupted by the internal
dynamics of one spouse's family of origin, an individual's “personal”
choice heavily impacting others (whether it's their family or an
entire country), and the effects of aging and dementia on both its
sufferers and their loved ones. We're willing to bet that anyone
reading this has been affected by at least one of these issues at
some point in their lives, and we hope that by the time the lights
fade on our final performance, audience and company alike will understand them differently than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p><i><b>Where's
the money going?</b></i></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Good question! Your gifts will help us bring you this
important piece of theater. Here's a breakdown:</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Initial
Goal: $1,800</b></p>
<p>
This will cover our rent for eight performances at a
beautiful black-box in a wonderful, easy-to-find theater with a
parking lot and a lobby full of comfy chairs for our audience to
enjoy, as well as an ingenious (and beautifully painted) convertible
set designed by Zoe Mikel-Stites and Elena Amesbury.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Stretch
Goal #1: $1,935+</b></p>
<p>
This will allow our inestimable costumer, Katie Cravens,
to buy some clothing and masks, rather than just raiding her own
(admittedly comprehensive) closet, to create a cohesive look for the
play and help the audience remember who everyone is.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Stretch
Goal #2: $2,160+</b></p>
<p>
Super Exciting Goal: This will allow us to rent some
BROADSWORDS! <i>Lear</i> has a fair amount of violence-- knock-down
drag-out brawling between Kent (Helen Young, <i>Andromache</i>) and
Oswald (Carolyn Biery), the famous maiming of Gloucester (Sandra
Howard), and sundry other duels, attempted muggings, and domestic
disputes as well as an epic battle for the fate of a kingdom. Not all
of his violence involves swords, but it will all be choreographed by
the wonderful Gabriel Howard (<i>The Dark Is Light Enough, As You
Like It)</i>, and we would love to give the cast some weapons worthy
of their talents and his... because in Shakespeare (and life?) some
disputes can only be settled with a large, pointy broadsword (used in
a safe and theatrically effective manner, of course.)</p>
<p><b><br/>Stretch
Goal #3: $2,300+</b></p>
<p>
This will cover all our production costs, and help us
explore further avenues in publicity and planning for future seasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And--
last but not least-- your gift gives us the ability for us to
continue operating on a shares system. Because CPTC's productions are
<b>entirely funded by donations</b>,
we can divide all the money we receive from ticket sales between the
actors, artists and crew involved with the show. None of us are in it
to get rich, obviously, or we'd probably be starving in Hollywood
(where it's warm) instead of here, but we firmly believe <b>art
is worth money and artists should be paid</b>.
Help us make that happen!</p>
<p>
</p><p><i><b>What
do I do now?</b></i></p>
<p>
</p><p>Get
involved-- donate! Every bit helps. Give early. Give often! And
share, share, share. Tell your friends, tell your enemies, tell those
people on the  Social Media that you probably know from your old job
or something. With your help, we can make this happen. Also, of
course, we have some perks for our backers! Look to your right. There
they are. (You may notice there are fewer material-object-type perks
than for previous campaigns-- that's because we humans all probably
have too much stuff, our director was never great at mailing them in
a timely fashion, and we decided to try forgoing most of them this
time and see how you responded. However, if you really want a
physical memento, just contact us and ask! We're happy to make and
send them on special request.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><i>Thank
you, with all our hearts, for your gift. And see you at the show!</i></p>

is a truly great tragedy; along with the exciting effects of
gender-swapping a well-known classic tragedy, which we talk about in
the video, our production will explore on a wide range of important
topics: sibling rivalry, a marriage disrupted by the internal
dynamics of one spouse's family of origin, an individual's “personal”
choice heavily impacting others (whether it's their family or an
entire country), and the effects of aging and dementia on both its
sufferers and their loved ones. We're willing to bet that anyone
reading this has been affected by at least one of these issues at
some point in their lives, and we hope that by the time the lights
fade on our final performance, audience and company alike will understand them differently than before.

Where's
the money going?


Good question! Your gifts will help us bring you this
important piece of theater. Here's a breakdown:

Initial
Goal: $1,800

This will cover our rent for eight performances at a
beautiful black-box in a wonderful, easy-to-find theater with a
parking lot and a lobby full of comfy chairs for our audience to
enjoy, as well as an ingenious (and beautifully painted) convertible
set designed by Zoe Mikel-Stites and Elena Amesbury.

Stretch
Goal #1: $1,935+

This will allow our inestimable costumer, Katie Cravens,
to buy some clothing and masks, rather than just raiding her own
(admittedly comprehensive) closet, to create a cohesive look for the
play and help the audience remember who everyone is.

Stretch
Goal #2: $2,160+

Super Exciting Goal: This will allow us to rent some
BROADSWORDS! Lear has a fair amount of violence-- knock-down
drag-out brawling between Kent (Helen Young, Andromache) and
Oswald (Carolyn Biery), the famous maiming of Gloucester (Sandra
Howard), and sundry other duels, attempted muggings, and domestic
disputes as well as an epic battle for the fate of a kingdom. Not all
of his violence involves swords, but it will all be choreographed by
the wonderful Gabriel Howard (The Dark Is Light Enough, As You
Like It), and we would love to give the cast some weapons worthy
of their talents and his... because in Shakespeare (and life?) some
disputes can only be settled with a large, pointy broadsword (used in
a safe and theatrically effective manner, of course.)
Stretch
Goal #3: $2,300+

This will cover all our production costs, and help us
explore further avenues in publicity and planning for future seasons.

And--
last but not least-- your gift gives us the ability for us to
continue operating on a shares system. Because CPTC's productions are
entirely funded by donations,
we can divide all the money we receive from ticket sales between the
actors, artists and crew involved with the show. None of us are in it
to get rich, obviously, or we'd probably be starving in Hollywood
(where it's warm) instead of here, but we firmly believe art
is worth money and artists should be paid.
Help us make that happen!

What
do I do now?

Get
involved-- donate! Every bit helps. Give early. Give often! And
share, share, share. Tell your friends, tell your enemies, tell those
people on the  Social Media that you probably know from your old job
or something. With your help, we can make this happen. Also, of
course, we have some perks for our backers! Look to your right. There
they are. (You may notice there are fewer material-object-type perks
than for previous campaigns-- that's because we humans all probably
have too much stuff, our director was never great at mailing them in
a timely fashion, and we decided to try forgoing most of them this
time and see how you responded. However, if you really want a
physical memento, just contact us and ask! We're happy to make and
send them on special request.)

Thank
you, with all our hearts, for your gift. And see you at the show!",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

""It's Good 2 be
Crazy,"" by intriguing young Los Angeles playwright Joanclair Richter,
is having its world premiere at the Hudson Guild on Theater Row in
Hollywood on July  8, 2011 for 6
weeks. The birth of this play and the launch of this new writing talent is a
very exciting process! 
 
 
About The
Play 
A Gen-Y coupleʼs love is tested when a young woman follows her
dream of becoming a successful recording artist.  Little does she know the lengths she will go to for success,
and her boyfriend isnʼt too happy about it either.
 
“It’s Good 2 be Crazy”
centers on relationships, the creative process and ambition in the 20-something
generation. 
 
Merryl lives in a white-walled, one bedroom, Hollywood apartment
with her boyfriend of 5 years, Joel. Her dream is to be a singer-songwriter and
when she loses her part-time job, she has no excuse for not devoting
herself full-time to making that demo album – right? When the months drag on with no tangible results, who can
blame Joel for wanting to see some progress - right?  And when Doug, the successful music industry executive and
family friend, who still harbors a schoolboy crush on Merryl, agrees to listen
to Merryl’s demo - it is solely for its artistic merit - right?  If only it were that simple.
 
Critically recognized, “It’s Good 2 be Crazy” is a finalist in the
Eventide Arts Competition and for the Kaplan Prize in Chatham, MA.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Davey Strattan White, and my company is called A Whole New Missoula. It includes a wonderful director, Jill Harrison, and an intrepid co-producer, Susan T. Kinniry. Our goal is to produce my solo theatre piece, <em>The Foundling Wheel, </em>in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival. With this play, we hope to explore the ever-growing animosity between the liberal and conservative concepts of America through the lens of extremely personal characters and their problems.</p>
<p><span>In the story, a liberal young hipster, frustrated by career displacement, goes to a tea party rally, and steals a baby. A conservative in crisis ditches his wife, and choir practice, and goes down the river on a canoe. Charon, the ferryman of the river Styx is forced to bear souls to the afterlife with or without his obulus payment. An odd story about financial redistribution, baby-snatching, and macro-cultural confusion.</span></p>

<p><b>About
Us</b></p>
<p>The 1500-seat, majestic Lincoln Amphitheatre is home to the outdoor musical drama
about President Lincoln’s Indiana boyhood years, <i>A. Lincoln: A Pioneer Tale</i>.
Lincoln Amphitheatre’s mission is to tell President Lincoln’s inspiring journey
from Indiana pioneer to president of the United States. His stories come to
life on the very grounds they took place nearly 200 years ago. With that said,
funding for the arts is decreasing and we are looking for partners to help
bridge the gap. Your monetary donation will play an integral role in keeping
our most regarded President’s legacy alive. </p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln spent 14 of his formative years in Indiana.  His
family settled in what is now known as Lincoln City, Indiana. During this time
he experienced the loss of his mother and sister. He was a merchant, flatboat operator, book
reader, and loved history. He was constantly learning and growing. On a trip to New
Orleans he witnessed the horrible treatment and devastation that was slavery.
Each of these events shaped Abraham Lincoln’s life and future.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is $50,000 by September 30. Funding will be
     used in conjunction with ticket sales and grant funding to compensate
     artists and production personnel, as well as to help cover the cost of
     the production. <i>A. Lincoln: A Pioneer
     Tale</i> has approximately 50 cast members and 25 technicians and design
     staff. </li>
<li>As a “Thank You!” donors will receive recognition on
     our website and our exclusive donor only e-newsletter. This newsletter will
let you know about theater happenings before the general public. You could also receive
     free tickets and invites to our opening reception for <i>A. Lincoln: A Pioneer Tale</i>. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>We strive to provide professional,
educational, and entertaining theater to our guests at affordable prices. We
want to be able to invite individuals, couples, and large families to experience
the unique atmosphere of our outdoor drama. The cost of each production makes
it very challenging to achieve this goal. That is why we ask for your help. It is
generous support from people like you who continue to help us reach our goals. Keep
in mind every Abraham Lincoln helps! (Think in $5 increments not pennies.)</p>

<p>Devon Frieder is an aspiring performer raised in Santa Fe who recently graduated from The Boston Conservatory with a B.F.A. in Musical Theatre. Over the last several years, she discovered a passion for directing, choreographing, and teaching young people as well, which she developed while producing multiple shows to provide other young aspiring performers in Santa Fe and Albuquerque with exciting new performing opportunities. This winter, she has the very exciting opportunity of producing the hit Broadway musical <em>The Wedding Singer</em> at Musical Theatre Southwest’s new black box, which performs the first two weekends of January. </p>
<p>This will be the 8th show she has directed, produced, and choreographed for teens/young adults in New Mexico.  Past shows include <em>Gypsy</em>, <em>You're a Good Man Charlie Brown</em>, <em>The Fantasticks</em>, and the New Mexico premieres (and extremely successful productions) of <em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em>, <em>13: The Musical</em>, and most recently, <em>Xanadu</em> at Warehouse 21 and The Box Performance space.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>In just over three years, Devon has assembled a large company of over 60 young actors, singers, dancers, and crew members.  Many of these young people have appeared in multiple productions because of the impact the shows have made on their lives.  Devon has received multiple letters from former cast members thanking her for helping them rediscover their love for theatre and, in some cases, overcome their fears of performing in public.   </p>
<p>In addition to gaining an intensive theatre experience that many no longer receive in school due to lack of arts funding, they are also developing artistic passions that they may not have had before and building life-long friendships and connections.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What We Need:</h3>
<p>The majority of the funds needed for this project will go towards renting the rehearsal and performance space, officially licensing the show through Music Theatre International, and providing accompaniment tracks, props, costumes, and sets.  All of Devon's shows would not have been possible without the extremely generous help of patrons and supporters like you.  Please help make this production of The Wedding Singer a reality with your contribution today. Even $5 can buy a necessary prop, and $20 can costume an entire character.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>Spread the word!  If you have ever been involved in or seen one of Devon's shows, you understand the kind of impact they have on both performers and audiences alike.  We urge you to tell everyone you know about this campaign and pitch in; remember, every little bit helps!</p></div>","Our Story:

<h3>We're Back At It Again In 2013!</h3>
<p>We are so excited to present our third season!</p>
<p>This year we are presenting two original adaptations -</p>
<p>""Anthem"" - based on the novella by Ayn Rand, Artistic Director Jennifer Sandella brings to life her re-imagining of this pivotal work in its US premiere!</p>
<p>""Libations Bearers"" - Martin Meccouri and Jennifer Sandella team up to give you a bloody, tribal, and earthy retelling of the Greek Tragedy.</p>
<p>PLUS WE'RE TEAMING UP ONCE AGAIN WITH BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK!</p>
<p>After our smash summer hit ""Twelfth Night"" hit the NYC park system, we're back at it again with a brand new take on Shakespeare's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING directed by Jessica Ko and Christopher Shepard! This production will bring great free Shakespeare to the Park's Bard on Pier 1 Series and have its very own full NYC run!</p>

Your donation will also go towards compensation for our cast and crew. And this is how RAT stands out from the rest!</li>
<li>In these economic times, it's becoming more common that the only jobs highly skilled and educated workers can find are unpaid internships.

We want to nurture creativity, but we also recognize the need to earn a living, and so compensate his/her energy, skills, and time accordingly.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jessica Butcher is a performer, writer and feminist. Anoushka Lucas is a singer, songwriter and feminist too. We believe it is very important to create more three dimensional female characters and have their stories heard.</p> <p>SPARKS examines the difficulties of grief and the female experience through multiple perspectives. It’s a show full of humour and love. It’s an honest story about being a woman and what it means to lose your mother. In this case, there's the added layer of losing your mother to multiple sclerosis. SPARKS doesn’t shy away from the hard questions, but it embraces the joy in the strength we find even in the darkest times. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Should you be able to contribute to this crowdfunder you will help us connect directly with people who are experiencing grief. You will help us grow our relationship with MIND, Winston’s Wish (the childhood bereavement charity, and the M.S. Society. You will be help us tell a universal story that connects everyone.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get us off the ground we need to raise £3,500 by the beginning of November. This money will allow us to get all the right creatives in a room, fund our artwork for the show, and most importantly help us build our relationships with our chosen charities. This will kick-start SPARKS and allow us time to R&amp;D the project prior to entering an intense rehearsal period. We need to raise £10,000 overall, and we will be doing this in stages, including an Arts Council Application and help from various charities.</p> <p>Should you be kind enough to donate we can offer you some rewards! Free tickets to an Anoushka Lucas gig in London. A morning with us in rehearsal. A behind the scenes video. A party with our sponsors and charities. Jessica will write you a story on any subject you wish.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe this play is highly important because it will provide a space for the audience to reflect on their own experiences of loss and it will hopefully make them laugh too. We are particularly interested in talking to people who are feeling held back by their self doubt. Your contribution will directly help in getting people talking and sharing their experiences is a safe and creative environment.</p> <p>Our team are experienced in bringing compassionate and entertaining theatre to the world.</p>

</div><p>DanceCrush Kids is a charitable organization dedicated to developing children physically, emotionally, socially, and academically, through dance.</p><ul>
<li>As Latin dance instructors in West Palm Beach, we saw a need in the community and immediately decided to help.  It began as a small idea and quickly grew into reality!  There are so many more children whose lives we could change if we had resources and assistance from people who are inspired by our mission.</li>
<li>This campaign allows us to admit additional children into our program who otherwise could not afford after-school programming. It is important they are occupied with productive physical activities after school because juvenile crime rates escalate between 3-7pm, and because 3 out of 10 children are obese or overweight.  With 1 out of 5 young people living in poverty, too many students are falling victim to negative influences during after-school hours and will greatly benefit from being an active part of DanceCrush Kids.  </li>
<li>Your contribution allows us to expand our program's hours, number of students admitted, and the amount of space we lease to accommodate the children, staff, and activity rooms.  The more we raise, the more lives we save by keeping kids in this community off the streets &amp; motivated to achieve!</li>
</ul><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>Our program operates on a sliding scale in which some parents/guardians are capable of covering part of the expense.  Every dollar you donate allows us to continue providing partial scholarships into our program for those who can afford to pay at a discounted rate.  However, many of our children are low-income and do not have any funds to contribute.  That is also where you come in!</li>
<li>It costs $15 per day to cover all of the expenses for a child to participate in DanceCrush Kids after school.  For $75, you can sponsor a DanceCrush Kid for a week.  For $300, you can help a child benefit academically, emotionally, socially and physically for an entire month.  And for $3,600 your generous gift has changed a child's life in ways we can only dream about.  Every dollar helps!  It is our vision that the children we serve will grow up to become productive citizens with strong values that lead them to paying it forward and positively contributing to society.</li>
<li>For specific increments of donations, you will receive either a brochure, a large booklet, or a DanceCrush Kids T-shirt.</li>
</ul><h3>The Impact of Dance</h3><ul>
<li>Physical - Dancing is a lifelong skill that promotes health and well-being far beyond kids' time at DanceCrush.  As an aerobic cardio exercise that, unlike most team and individual sports, requires little to no special equipment, dancing provides a healthy, low-cost way for kids to be active.  </li>
<li>Academic - Dancing is a creative outlet for kids that builds an appreciation for the arts.  Studies have shown students who receive dance instruction do better in math and science, and have higher test scores, than those with no instruction.</li>
<li>Emotional - Dance creates confidence and increases self-esteem.  It also provides a mechanism to help kids cope with stress, anxiety, and depression in a positive, non-judgmental environment.</li>
<li>Social - Dance builds connections to others in a constructive way.  Kids who participate in dance learn teamwork, communication skills, and co-operation, all while forging new friendships.  </li>
</ul><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Even if you can't contribute monetarily, you can still be vital to our operation &amp; growth!</p><ul>

<p>We think of animals as different from us. When we say the word animal, we often mean ‘not human’. Beloved Prey is a story inspired by a strange phenomenon in nature where a predator animal adopts a prey animal, instead of eating them. Through this story we explore what we consider human emotion, compassion, feeling, is very much animal.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>THE TRAVELING OPERA</h2>
<p>When we hear the word opera, we think of a big orchestra, aristocratic costumes, grandiose theatres, and lyrics you can’t understand. The origin of the oral tradition, however, was more modest; bards and minstrels who spread stories from place to place on foot. The focus was on storytelling and less on theatrics.</p>
<p> We tailor the story and the production to be portable so that the show can be put on virtually anywhere - folding backdrops for easy transport and instant staging, a score composed specifically for very few instruments, sets that don’t need elaborate lighting and articulate lyrics that don’t need electronic translation.</p>
<p>Grand opera made these stories stationary. We’re putting opera back on the road.</p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p></span></h2>
<h2><span>BRINGING NEW OPERA INTO EXISTING SPACES</span></h2>
<p>Grand opera uses a theatre space  to bring old operas to life. Beloved Prey transforms existing spaces into a stage to bring new operas to life. Our production brings the emphasis back to opera’s key elements: music, story, gesture and your imagination.</p>

We think of animals as different from us. When we say the word animal, we often mean ‘not human’. Beloved Prey is a story inspired by a strange phenomenon in nature where a predator animal adopts a prey animal, instead of eating them. Through this story we explore what we consider human emotion, compassion, feeling, is very much animal.


THE TRAVELING OPERA
When we hear the word opera, we think of a big orchestra, aristocratic costumes, grandiose theatres, and lyrics you can’t understand. The origin of the oral tradition, however, was more modest; bards and minstrels who spread stories from place to place on foot. The focus was on storytelling and less on theatrics.
 We tailor the story and the production to be portable so that the show can be put on virtually anywhere - folding backdrops for easy transport and instant staging, a score composed specifically for very few instruments, sets that don’t need elaborate lighting and articulate lyrics that don’t need electronic translation.
Grand opera made these stories stationary. We’re putting opera back on the road.


http://www.japanculture-nyc.com/2015/10/10/koto-performer-kento-iwasaki-develops-his-concept-of-portable-opera/

BRINGING NEW OPERA INTO EXISTING SPACES
Grand opera uses a theatre space  to bring old operas to life. Beloved Prey transforms existing spaces into a stage to bring new operas to life. Our production brings the emphasis back to opera’s key elements: music, story, gesture and your imagination.
MUSIC- Beloved Prey blends Japanese traditional music with elements of European opera. A rich palette is painted through only 3 instruments and a handful of singers, creating an intimate yet immersive experience.
STORY - Our focus isn’t reproducing historical operas, but using the medium to tell stories. With an emphasis on articulation, and lyrics that merge the colloquial and poetic, Beloved Prey brings the wisdom of nature to a wide audience, not only those in reach of an opera house.
GESTURE - Choreography that blends traditional Japanese Noh theatre and dance creates a stylized and immersive language of gestures. Movement embodies and gives life to the story.
IMAGINATION - Your imagination is always there! It’s not only activated in an opera house!  Your imagination is what makes the experience, whether inside or outside a traditional theatre space.



WHY OPERA SHOULD TRAVELNot everyone lives in a major metropolis with an opera house. However, everyone should have access to the arts - live, not just on Youtube. We want to bring Beloved Prey to you, wherever you are. Experiencing art should not be a privilege of city-dwellers alone, opera is an art form of storytelling and should be accessible anywhere.

WHO WE ARE



Beloved Prey is the first of many operas the Traveling Opera Company plans to produce and put on the road. We are pioneering a new genre: ""traveling opera"". Beloved Prey demonstrates how a small-scale production can compete against a grand opera production. We believe that imagination, efficiency and quality is key.We envision bringing opera to a variety of spaces, not just limited to the theater - zoos, museums, art galleries, anime conventions, archways, even resonant parking lots can be transformed into opera spaces through The Traveling Opera Company. We want to create a company that has the administrative power to engage in new productions and booking existing productions year-round. Products need marketing, so do artistic works. Therefore, we wish to hire booking agents, marketers, PR, so “traveling operas” becomes a household term. This is a movement, not just a flash in the pan.  We encourage the public to engage in our artistic process as such a movement is impossible without your support.





KENTO IWASAKI
Founder of The Traveling Opera Company, Kento Iwasaki is a classically trained composer and koto performer. His goal is to create music that acts as a bridge between the traditional and current moment, fusing old and new, East and West,  helping us connect with our ancestors. He studied koto with Satomi Fukami and Yoko Reikano Kimura and received training in opera composition from Libby Larsen, John Corgliano and and William Bolcolm. He also received training in the art of collaboration at the Nautilus Music-Theater/New Dramatists Composer-Librettist Studio. Previous composition teachers include Mark Jurcisin, Matthew Greenbaum and Richard Danielpour.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Elisabeth, and I am an advanced ballet dancer living in Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada. I have been dancing ballet since I was 3 years old, and it has always been my dream to dance in a professional ballet company. Being in Grade 11, and nearing the field of professional dance, I need to be in an intense daily training program in order to achieve my goals.</p>
<p>I auditioned for several full year programs, not even expecting to be accepted. I was then offered this incredible once in a life time opportunity to train throughout the year in the professional program at the prestigious Goh Ballet Academy in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am so excited that I have this amazing opportunity, which will be a huge stepping stone in my career!</p>
<p>The only thing stopping me from attending is the huge financial cost. After everything is paid for, the costs will come to over $20,000 dollars. My family cannot pay for this alone, and we will be fundraising in many different ways to try and realize my dreams!</p>
<p>Dancing means the world to me and I could not imagine life without it. Ballet is the only thing I have ever wanted to pursue as a career, and this incredible opportunity will allow me to further myself on this path. Please support me in this endeavour, and help me to live my dreams!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will need a total of $20, 000 to support this endeavor. (It is a ten month program spanning from September 2013-June 2014). My Indiegogo goal is $500, as we will be fundraising in many different ways.</p>
<p>-Tuition (cost of classes): $6,810</p>
<p>-Billet/Homestay (cost of food and board): $9,000 ($900/mth)</p>
<p>-Pointe Shoes (I go through a pair every 2 weeks): $2,400</p>
<p>-Other Equipment (Bodysuits, tights, hair supplies, ballet shoes): $460</p>
<p>-Flight Costs (beginning and end of year/holidays): $1.330</p>
<p>If I do not achieve my total goal from funds raised on this site and elsewhere, the funds will go towards saving up for attending a trainee/apprenticeship program with a ballet company the following year, after I graduate from high school.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It has always been my dream to become a professional ballerina. Finally I have been given this amazing opportunity, and it would mean the world to me to be able to attend this world renowned school. This is the opportunity that will allow me to pursue the career of my dreams. It is the perfect stepping stone to my professional career. To be able to successfully pursue my passions, I need to be in an intense program with good quality training, and lots of hours. This program at the Goh Ballet Academy offers all of these things, and more. This is the opportunity of a life time, and I would be crushed if I missed it. Any help we can get in supporting this endeavor would be amazing.</p>
<p><br/>Attending this school would allow for me to improve immensely, and grow incredibly as a dancer and a person. It is truly the opportunity of a lifetime, and in no way could it possibly fail to improve my ballet technique, stamina, and strength. It will open doors to opportunities that I will never have if I stay training where I am. Please give any support possible. Even the most minimal contribution will make a huge difference.</p>

<h3>Who are we?:</h3>
<p>We are a group of performers who have been working in Ayrshire for the past five years.  Our town is currently without a theatre and we have been trying to keep the performing arts alive using non-theatre spaces.  Our campaign is to raise money for a family-friendly production that can be enjoyed by our entire community. It will introduce a younger audience to the magic of theatre and will entertain audiences of all ages with a unqiue take on a children's classic. </p>
<h3>The money needed:</h3>
<p>We are asking for $1400 which would allow us to bring Lewis Carroll's world to life.  The money would go towards equipment, marketing, costume, props and actors exspenses.  The money would also contribute towards the 'special effects'.  Our production will use animated projections to bring this fantastical tale to the stage and so money will go towards local artists.  By paying these artists we can ensure they are able to dedicate the huge amounts of time that go into animation.  If we do not raise the full funds needed we will dedicate the money raised to providing high-quality projections during the show meaning that the magical worlds will remain with cuts being made else where, such as costumes and props.</p>
<h3>Incentives:</h3>
<p>For people who donate $25 we will include your name in our programme as one of our sponsers.  Donations of $50 will get you a DVD of the finished event. For donations of $1000 we can provide a DVD, a signed cast photograph and one of the props used during the production.</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Contributions will be going towards creating an unforgetable performance.  </p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute we would be grateful if you could spread this campaign using social-media and help us reach our target so that we can entertain and continue to do what we love.</p>

<p>Sylvani has known since she was
 3 that she is a Dancer. <b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To Sylvani, dancing is life, dancing is breathing. Dance is where she expresses her soul and touches yours.</b></p>
<div>This summer, Sylvani is hoping to go to <a href=""http://school.obt.org/index.php/summer-programs/summer-intensive/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Ballet Theater's 6-week summer ballet intensive</a>, where she will be in the top level, and offered a possible opportunity to dance professionally with their second company!!!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><strong style=""color: #660099;"">Please will you help her meet the cost of this program? Any contribution helps!</strong></b></div>Sylvani has been training, both at her home studio in Eugene, <a href=""http://oregonballetacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Ballet Academy</a>, since she was 3, and also at wonderful summer 
intensives (<b><a href=""http://joffrey.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joffrey Ballet</a>, <a href=""http://www.obt.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Ballet Theater</a>, <a href=""http://texasballettheater.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Texas Ballet Theater</a>,</b> and <a href=""https://www.whitman.edu/summer-dance-lab"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whitman Summer Dance Lab</a>) each year since she was 13. </div><div>Sylvani has been honored to dance 
lead roles in her studio's Fall ballet productions. She has occasionally 
been invited to dance in other venues as well. Her artistry, her 
musicality and her beauty in story telling are evident to any who watch her. </div><div>
<b>Audience members have told us that they can't take their eyes off Sylvani when she dances! </b><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Sylvani's devotion to Dance, as an art form that transforms those who witness it as well as the dancer herself, is core to everything she does.</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">    </span>

Here's why:</b></div><div>
<ul>
<li><b style=""background-color: initial;"">She is already placed in OBT's top, pre-professional level.</b></li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">It is close to home, </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">with family members in town, so less cost and also easier possibility of immediately moving there for year-round training.</span>
</li>
<li><b style=""background-color: initial;"">4-6 week attendees have an chance to be picked for <a href=""http://school.obt.org/index.php/obt2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OBT2</a>, OBT's second company. </b></li>
<li>
<b>Most important: </b>The personal attention and smaller classes she found at OBT, in their top level with company members taking class with her, will help her really fine tune, giving her the edge she feels she still needs to be ready for Joffrey's top professional level in next summer's intensive, and to audition for either company the following fall!</li>
</ul>
<b>Sylvani has a big dream, and she has thoughtfully decided that OBT's program will get her there.<br/></b>
<blockquote><p><span style=""color: #660099;"">""I have come to understand that dancers emit a speech-- a song-- through their bodies. I think that <a href=""http://school.obt.org/index.php/summer-programs/summer-intensive/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Ballet Theater's summer intensive</a> could help me learn to facilitate that within myself.  As I have grown up and changed and become aware of so much of the world around me-- the breakthroughs and the barriers, the struggles between humans and nature, especially between humans and other humans-- I have found how dance itself has matured into an agent of change. The nuances of movement can convey such rich and intense emotions that they can completely transport an audience, which I have experienced at OBT performances. I understand that ballet is extremely competitive, and opportunities to get one's pointed foot in the door are rare, but I hope that with the proper training, and a great opportunity like OBT2 </span><span style=""color: #660099;"">(OBT's second company) to work for, I could have a shot.""</span><strong style=""color: #660099;""><b> --Sylvani<br/></b></strong></p></blockquote>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Sylvani has always known she was a dancer! When she was only 3, I took her to see ""The Nutcracker"", and she told me she wanted to be the Sugar Plum Fairy one day. Her grandparents agreed to pay for ballet lessons (my mother is a dancer, too), and the dream began. </p>
<p><span><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>At age 14, Sylvani was honored by her main teacher, John Grensback, Artistic Director of Oregon Ballet Academy, to be one of a triple cast chosen to dance the sparkly fairy of the Land of Sweets!</b></span></p>

<p>At age 6, after seeing ""Swan Lake"", Sylvani informed me she would one day dance 
as Odette, the Swan Queen. Many little girls dream of putting on a tutu,
 but most eventually turn to other things. Not Sylvani...she was 
determined, Sylvani kept going, kept dreaming. <br/></p>

<h4>Whitman Summer Dance Lab...First Journey Away<br/>
</h4>
<p>When Sylvani was 12, her teacher's wife, Megan Murphy, who danced for San Francisco Ballet and Houston Ballet, told us it was time for her to audition for some summer intensives. <b>A summer intensive involves several weeks of dancing all day, every day, with current professionals, company faculty, and former stars, then spending nights in the dorm with other dedicated young dancers--eating, sleeping, breathing dance! This is an opportunity to fully immerse in the world of Dance as both an artform and a profession, making contacts, learning different styles, and learning new techniques to help with ""trouble spots"".</b></p>
<p>Ms. Murphy said Sylvani was very young, and may not get accepted, but it would be good practice, as the auditions are high pressure. Sylvani auditioned for American Ballet Theater, and Whitman Summer Dance Lab. To her surprise, she was accepted to both! But they cost thousands of dollars. </p>
<p>We launched a campaign here on Indiegogo. We called it ""<b><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-sylvani-dance/x/421042#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Help Sylvani Dance</a></b>"" and raised everything she needed to go to Whitman Summer Dance Lab for 2 weeks. <b><a href=""http://kval.com/news/local/eugene-ballerina-raises-thousands-through-online-campaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our local television station even did a news report on her!</a><br/>Thanks to the ""Go Go Factor""  of all the contributors, Sylvani was discovered by a wealthy sponsor who paid all her expenses for the following year!  <br/></b></p>

One thing Sylvani learned is that Joffrey places students in levels according to their age. This meant that she was in the third level at age 16, and if she goes back this summer, will likely be in their second level. Their top level is for 18 year olds and up, who are ready to move into a professional career or an apprenticeship with Joffrey's Studio Company. Sylvani also learned, from <b><a href=""http://joffrey.org/ashleywheater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joffrey Artistic Director, Ashley Wheaton</a></b>, that he prefers to hire dancers who have professional experience with another company. <br/><br/><h4>

She also was thrilled to take class with <b><a href=""http://www.theudancer.com/interview-africa-guzman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Africa Guzman</a></b>, Principal Dancer from Compania Nacional de Danza in Madrid, Spain.

<span style=""color: #660099;"">The Choice for age 17 is Oregon Ballet Theater...The Journey Continues... </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">but getting SO close! </span>
</h3>
<b>Sylvani  was accepted to all the intensives she auditioned for (Boston Ballet, Texas Ballet Theater, American Ballet Theater, Joffrey and OBT).  Joffrey and OBT were her ""first"" choice--for different reasons.  </b>
</div><div><b>Though she would love to go to both, their main intensives overlap dates, and of course, there is the money. So, Sylvani's choice for this summer is OBT. </b></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Here's why:</b></span></div><div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Placement Level: </b>OBT has placed Sylvani in their top, Pre-professional level. This means she will dance with the best students OBT has, get the highest level of instruction, and even possibly have company members taking class alongside her.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Second Company:</b> Oregon Ballet Theater has a ""second company""--OBT2--an entry level scholarship year-round performance and training group that performs with the main company in larger productions and also has their own performances. Students in the top level at OBT's summer intensive for at least 4, and preferably 6 weeks are considered for this amazing opportunity.<b> Current and former professionals who know Sylvani are telling us she has a very good chance of being chosen! </b></span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Personal Attention/Smaller classes:</b> OBT offers a smaller program, so there is much more personal attention. Every dancer has her technique challenges, whether it is faster turns or higher jumps. Sylvani felt that she received more direct corrections at OBT than elsewhere. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Closer to Home for Year-Round Training: </b>While this is just tentative, it may be time for her to move to a company's year-round academy. She may be able to graduate high school early next year, and OBT is in Portland, two hours from us, and where the rest of our family lives. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</li>
</ul>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Sylvani feels OBT's full 6 week program will push her skills to their highest level yet, and give her what she needs to actually begin her dance career in the next two years! </b><br/>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""color: #660099;"">Talent, Drive, Dedication, What Else Does She Need?....$$$!!!</span></h3>This training is  very necessary, but also very expensive, and I cannot afford it without your help. Sylvani has been blessed with so many opportunities, and has worked so hard all these years...she is nearly there! I wish I could just pay this for my daughter, but my income is limited and I'm helping to support an adult daughter with chronic disabling conditions, as well as now her little baby (my granddaughter!), and I'm also the sole income for our family at home. <b>Sylvani works hard, and has a real chance at a dance career--she is just a year or two away, so this summer is very important.</b> I'm able to help some, but must turn to you for help. After all these years, if Sylvani couldn't continue, well..that would break my heart, and it would also mean that we might not ever know what all that passion can become...<b>Please help Sylvani continue her journey.</b>

Sylvani stands upon a threshold...she is 17...at the age when pre-professional dancers begin their final steps to their career.  Please help her go to Oregon Ballet Theater's 6-week Summer Ballet Intensive, where she will prepare to launch into her Dream!





The Synopsis: 
(That's ""Ballet Talk"" for ""The Short Version"")
Sylvani has known since she was
 3 that she is a Dancer. To Sylvani, dancing is life, dancing is breathing. Dance is where she expresses her soul and touches yours.
This summer, Sylvani is hoping to go to Oregon Ballet Theater's 6-week summer ballet intensive, where she will be in the top level, and offered a possible opportunity to dance professionally with their second company!!!

Please will you help her meet the cost of this program? Any contribution helps!Sylvani has been training, both at her home studio in Eugene, Oregon Ballet Academy, since she was 3, and also at wonderful summer 
intensives (Joffrey Ballet, Oregon Ballet Theater, Texas Ballet Theater, and Whitman Summer Dance Lab) each year since she was 13. Sylvani has been honored to dance 
lead roles in her studio's Fall ballet productions. She has occasionally 
been invited to dance in other venues as well. Her artistry, her 
musicality and her beauty in story telling are evident to any who watch her. 
Audience members have told us that they can't take their eyes off Sylvani when she dances! Sylvani's devotion to Dance, as an art form that transforms those who witness it as well as the dancer herself, is core to everything she does.    
                       
Sylvani spends over 20
 hours every week in dance class during the school year--after school and on weekends. Even more when rehearsing for a performance. But aspiring professional dancers must go to summer intensives with a ballet company: 5-6 weeks of dancing all day, 40 hours a week or more, at a ballet company academy, with current professionals, company faculty, and guest artists helping to further refine and strengthen her technique, giving insight into careers, and making connections for her future. It's hard, rigorous work...and it's what Sylvani loves. 
The audition process is rigorous and competitive, only about 10% of dancers are even accepted during national audition tours. Sylvani regularly is not only accepted, but offered some level of scholarship.This past winter, Sylvani auditioned for several summer intensives, with her most desired ones being Joffrey Ballet and Oregon Ballet Theater.                                  
Age 17, for a dancer, is time to make one's final launch plans for a ballet company apprenticeship and then a career. She essentially has one more year to go before auditioning for company apprenticeships and trainee positions. After much consideration, she has decided that Oregon Ballet Academy is her best step this summer. Here's why:

She is already placed in OBT's top, pre-professional level.

It is close to home, with family members in town, so less cost and also easier possibility of immediately moving there for year-round training.

4-6 week attendees have an chance to be picked for OBT2, OBT's second company. 

Most important: The personal attention and smaller classes she found at OBT, in their top level with company members taking class with her, will help her really fine tune, giving her the edge she feels she still needs to be ready for Joffrey's top professional level in next summer's intensive, and to audition for either company the following fall!

Sylvani has a big dream, and she has thoughtfully decided that OBT's program will get her there.
""I have come to understand that dancers emit a speech-- a song-- through their bodies. I think that Oregon Ballet Theater's summer intensive could help me learn to facilitate that within myself.  As I have grown up and changed and become aware of so much of the world around me-- the breakthroughs and the barriers, the struggles between humans and nature, especially between humans and other humans-- I have found how dance itself has matured into an agent of change. The nuances of movement can convey such rich and intense emotions that they can completely transport an audience, which I have experienced at OBT performances. I understand that ballet is extremely competitive, and opportunities to get one's pointed foot in the door are rare, but I hope that with the proper training, and a great opportunity like OBT2 (OBT's second company) to work for, I could have a shot."" --Sylvani
The Cost Breakdown:


6 weeks Tuition: $2205
Room and Board: $3100
8 pairs of pointe shoes, 5 leotards, 6 pairs of tights: $670
Full Cost: $5975
Subtractions we've already been able to make: 


-$500 from my tax refund
-$1000 (2 weeks housing at Grandma and Grandpa's in Portland)
Applied for OBT scholarship: Hope to receive $1000  (UPDATE: ACTUALLY RECIEVED $1500!!! we reduced our goal by $500! )  
A friend, Mike Jones, contributed $100 directly through another campaign.

Total: $3375
We were thankfully able to reduce our goal to $2875, because OBT gave Sylvani a $1500 scholarship--$500 more than we'd hoped!  AND WE REACHED THAT GOAL!!! 
But there are still many costs not covered here, so we hope you will still contribute to Help Sylvani Dance! 
If you contribute, check out the wonderful ""perks"" on the sidebar!  You can also use the ""share"" tools near the top to help spread the word--""Crowdfunding"" takes a crowd!

Read on for the Full Ballet...

Dreaming of Sugar Plums...

 


Sylvani has always known she was a dancer! When she was only 3, I took her to see ""The Nutcracker"", and she told me she wanted to be the Sugar Plum Fairy one day. Her grandparents agreed to pay for ballet lessons (my mother is a dancer, too), and the dream began. 

At age 14, Sylvani was honored by her main teacher, John Grensback, Artistic Director of Oregon Ballet Academy, to be one of a triple cast chosen to dance the sparkly fairy of the Land of Sweets!


           
Becoming a Swan...
At age 6, after seeing ""Swan Lake"", Sylvani informed me she would one day dance 
as Odette, the Swan Queen. Many little girls dream of putting on a tutu,
 but most eventually turn to other things. Not Sylvani...she was 
determined, Sylvani kept going, kept dreaming. 
At age 15, Mr. Grensback honored her once again with the role of Odette/Odile in a triple cast in his production of ""Swan Lake""! I don't know how many little girls set their sights on something like this, but to dance THE ultimate ballet role, even in a student production, at this age was a dream come true! 
         


Snow White...Telling an Entire Story...

      


This year, Sylvani was again cast in the lead role in a triple cast...this time ""Snow White and the Seven Dancing Dwarves"", Mr. Grensback's own creation.  (photos from rehearsals)


The role of ""Snow White"" was unique to even most lead roles, in that Sylvani danced in nearly every scene. Rehearsals every day, AFTER regular dance class, AFTER high school (where she is pulling down all A's and B's).  Learning to act with innocence and love with her ""Prince""...

Meeting Fairies in the Forest who protect her and the animals...                                             
Dying tragically when the ""Queen"" gives her a poisoned apple. And comic timing, story telling, and joy in partnering with seven ""dwarves"" of varying ages. 

         
 
                   
Sylvani had to take on the full role, beginning to end, to tell the story of the beautiful ""Snow"".                                                                                                                                                     

A Rare Journey of Self Knowledge, and the Support of So Many...
If you watch the video at the very top of this campaign, you glimpse an incredible journey through photos...a rare 
one...the journey of one who has ALWAYS been destined to be a Dancer, with the incredible gift of always knowing it.  
 

You see 
someone who has with a work ethic: through painful pointe shoes, pulled tendons, and
 ""costume malfunctions"", and never let her audience know. 

You see growth: long hours striving for 
perfection,  hard work,  the fulfillment of each step in a dance, and 
maybe...you see the Future.


There is something else you will see...you see many, many other people along the way. 

You see teachers who have given their knowledge, their drive, their own 
spirit of love from their own similar journeys. You ""see"" the audience, (though invisible, as if from the lights of a stage), who 
Sylvani dances for, and hopes to give a piece of her heart to.
And you see yourself... YOU, are such an important sponsor, without whom Sylvani could not continue to reach for her dreams of bringing her unique dance ""voice"" to the world. Sylvani dreams of bringing change to the world through dance--and you bring the means for that to happen!Sylvani has received so much support from so many!It's been truly incredible, and overwhelming, to see just how many people want to give to help her succeed! Sylvani's grandparents on my side have paid for her year-round ballet lessons since she was 3. Sylvani's grandparents on her father's side, may their memory be for a blessing, gave love endlessly, and help with additional costs. Sylvani had an anonymous sponsor who so kindly paid for all her intensive costs and many other things for a year--though we do not know what happened to him, we bless him for giving us a sense that all this IS possible! Some have given a place to stay while traveling, or airline miles (this year, no planes!). And there have been so many more, hundreds of you, who have been willing to give $1, $5, $10 (if 100 people give $10, we've raised $1000!),$25, $50 and up to $100, $200, $300, even $1000!!  Each one of you, we are so grateful for, for this would not happen without you. 
Journeys Afar...summers spent training away from home.
Whitman Summer Dance Lab...First Journey Away

When Sylvani was 12, her teacher's wife, Megan Murphy, who danced for San Francisco Ballet and Houston Ballet, told us it was time for her to audition for some summer intensives. A summer intensive involves several weeks of dancing all day, every day, with current professionals, company faculty, and former stars, then spending nights in the dorm with other dedicated young dancers--eating, sleeping, breathing dance! This is an opportunity to fully immerse in the world of Dance as both an artform and a profession, making contacts, learning different styles, and learning new techniques to help with ""trouble spots"".
Ms. Murphy said Sylvani was very young, and may not get accepted, but it would be good practice, as the auditions are high pressure. Sylvani auditioned for American Ballet Theater, and Whitman Summer Dance Lab. To her surprise, she was accepted to both! But they cost thousands of dollars. 
We launched a campaign here on Indiegogo. We called it ""Help Sylvani Dance"" and raised everything she needed to go to Whitman Summer Dance Lab for 2 weeks. Our local television station even did a news report on her!Thanks to the ""Go Go Factor""  of all the contributors, Sylvani was discovered by a wealthy sponsor who paid all her expenses for the following year!  
At age 14, Sylvani returned to Whitman Summer Dance Lab for a second year, this time for 5 weeks. She was among 10 top students chosen to participate in a professional dance festival, with San Francisco modern dance company, ODC Dance's choroegrapher, KT Nelson, creating a piece on them.  Texas Ballet Theater...Journey Farther Afield

The following year, at age 15, Sylvani again auditioned for many company intensives, and this time, was blessed to go to Texas Ballet Theater, where she was offered a 90% tuition scholarship! Once again, we raised the remaining funds her on Indiegogo, with ""Help Sylvani Dance 2.0"", and so many of you helped out!
Her primary teacher, Mr. Grensback, was guest faculty there, as he had been a Principal dancer under the TBT choreographer, Sir Ben Stevenson, when he was choreographer for the Houston Ballet in the 80's. Sylvani took class with current TBT company members, and all the TBT faculty, including former Houston Ballet Principals Kathryn Warakomsky and Li Anlin. 
Joffrey Ballet in Chicago...Journey to Her Dream Company!
Last summer, Sylvani's teacher, Mr. Grensback, said that at age 16, if she had a company she really hoped to dance for one day, this was the time to go...both to                                                                                 
   be seen by them, and also to gain insight into how to one day dance for them. Sylvani's favorite company is Joffrey Ballet, in Chicago, and when they offered her 50% off her tuition, and she also was one of 16 high school arts students nationally to win the Anthony Quinn Foundation Scholarship to help her go, Sylvani took her chance!  ""Help Sylvani Dance to Joffrey"", with help from our community of family and friends, YOU, she was able to go! Dancing in the Joffrey Tower, staying in downtown Chicago, and learning choreography of the Joffrey repertoire was an amazing experience that she hopes to repeat. She learned so much!                                                                 However, she found that she still has a way to go. One thing Sylvani learned is that Joffrey places students in levels according to their age. This meant that she was in the third level at age 16, and if she goes back this summer, will likely be in their second level. Their top level is for 18 year olds and up, who are ready to move into a professional career or an apprenticeship with Joffrey's Studio Company. Sylvani also learned, from Joffrey Artistic Director, Ashley Wheaton, that he prefers to hire dancers who have professional experience with another company. 
Oregon Ballet Theater-- on the Threshold of her Future Journeys...After she returned from Joffrey, Sylvani was also able to attend Oregon Ballet Theater in Portland for 2 weeks.  Both were wonderful in different ways.  She still dreams of being a Joffrey dancer one day, but OBT showed her a path that feels  more ""right"" to actually achieve that dream, while giving her a company close to home where she can train--perhaps year round--and maybe even dance for! At the OBT intensive, a smaller environment, she received lots of direct attention, had company members taking class with her so she could watch them up close working on every detail, and felt she was able to gain real ground on the aspects of her technique that challenge her. She also was thrilled to take class with Africa Guzman, Principal Dancer from Compania Nacional de Danza in Madrid, Spain. Ms. Guzman was the muse of Nacho Duato, a thrilling contemporary choreographer, and she taught Sylvani's class several short pieces of Mr. Duato's choreography. She is energetic and joyful, and Sylvani felt lifted by the experience. Ms. Guzman is expected to return this summer to OBT. Sylvani was also very excited to learn that she had caught the eye of both the OBT academy's Director, Anthony Jones, who taught some of her classes, and the OBT Company Artistic Director, Kevin Irving, who often observed classes.
The Choice for age 17 is Oregon Ballet Theater...The Journey Continues... but getting SO close! 

Sylvani  was accepted to all the intensives she auditioned for (Boston Ballet, Texas Ballet Theater, American Ballet Theater, Joffrey and OBT).  Joffrey and OBT were her ""first"" choice--for different reasons.  
Though she would love to go to both, their main intensives overlap dates, and of course, there is the money. So, Sylvani's choice for this summer is OBT. Here's why:

Placement Level: OBT has placed Sylvani in their top, Pre-professional level. This means she will dance with the best students OBT has, get the highest level of instruction, and even possibly have company members taking class alongside her.
Second Company: Oregon Ballet Theater has a ""second company""--OBT2--an entry level scholarship year-round performance and training group that performs with the main company in larger productions and also has their own performances. Students in the top level at OBT's summer intensive for at least 4, and preferably 6 weeks are considered for this amazing opportunity. Current and former professionals who know Sylvani are telling us she has a very good chance of being chosen! 
Personal Attention/Smaller classes: OBT offers a smaller program, so there is much more personal attention. Every dancer has her technique challenges, whether it is faster turns or higher jumps. Sylvani felt that she received more direct corrections at OBT than elsewhere. 

Closer to Home for Year-Round Training: While this is just tentative, it may be time for her to move to a company's year-round academy. She may be able to graduate high school early next year, and OBT is in Portland, two hours from us, and where the rest of our family lives.  


Sylvani feels OBT's full 6 week program will push her skills to their highest level yet, and give her what she needs to actually begin her dance career in the next two years! 

Talent, Drive, Dedication, What Else Does She Need?....$$$!!!This training is  very necessary, but also very expensive, and I cannot afford it without your help. Sylvani has been blessed with so many opportunities, and has worked so hard all these years...she is nearly there! I wish I could just pay this for my daughter, but my income is limited and I'm helping to support an adult daughter with chronic disabling conditions, as well as now her little baby (my granddaughter!), and I'm also the sole income for our family at home. Sylvani works hard, and has a real chance at a dance career--she is just a year or two away, so this summer is very important. I'm able to help some, but must turn to you for help. After all these years, if Sylvani couldn't continue, well..that would break my heart, and it would also mean that we might not ever know what all that passion can become...Please help Sylvani continue her journey.

What we Need
Here's the Cost Breakdown:


6 weeks Tuition: $2205
Room and Board: $3100
8 pairs of pointe shoes, 5 leotards, 6 pairs of tights: $670
There are myriad other costs that add up, but we are not including them here.



Full Cost: $5975

Subtractions we've already been able to make: 


-$500 from my tax refund
-$1000 (2 weeks housing at Grandma and Grandpa's in Portland)
Applied for OBT scholarship: Hope to receive $1000
We received a direct contribution from Mike Jones, a longtime friend and supporter, and the campaign amount was reduced by $100 by Indiegogo because he made that contribution on another campaign.

Total: $3375
Will you please contribute to the goal of $3375, to Help Sylvani Dance?
If, we do not reach our goal, we will still put any money raised towards Sylvani's dance training...perhaps with a shorter time at OBT or extra lessons in Portland or at home. 
If we go OVER our goal, it may be possible for Sylvani to also go to Joffrey for 3 weeks!  Or to take extra lessons while at OBT.

<h3>We Are IRTE</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to IRTE's 2017 Season fundraising campaign!</p>
<p>We are the <strong>Improvisational Repertory Theatre Ensemble</strong>, a New York City-based, award-winning company of improvisational actors, producers, and creators of original, character-driven, improvisational comedy theater. Over the past five years we have conceived, developed, created, and performed about two dozen distinct productions.</p>
<p>In 2017, we embark on our sixth season, and we're excited to bring to our audiences 4 very different productions, including 3 brand new shows: <strong><i>The Sense-ations!</i></strong>, <i><strong>The Experiment</strong>, </i>and<i> <strong>Avoidance!</strong>; </i>and for the first time ever, <i>a sequel</i> to last season's hilarious original show - <i>Big, Rich &amp; Powerful - <strong>BRP II</strong></i><strong> </strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>IRTE 2017 Ensemble</h3>

<h3>Your Contributions Make a Difference</h3>
<p>Just as large performing arts organizations all over the country depend on contributions from an ever-expanding pool of committed sponsors, IRTE counts on the support of our audience not just at the theater attending our shows, but also as champions of our success behind the scenes as financial contributors.</p>
<p>At IRTE, we tend to each and every aspect of producing a full season of original theatrical productions. This includes renting rehearsal and performance space, paying directors and tech crew, promoting our shows, attending festivals both in New York City and out of state, insurance and overhead, etc.</p>
<p>Thanks to the generous support of people like you, IRTE has continued to prosper year after year in the very competitive theater market that is New York City. Never underestimate the value of even the smallest contribution you can make!</p>
<p><i>IRTE 2017 is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-­profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of IRTE 2017 must be made payable to “Fractured Atlas” only. Any contribution above the value of the goods and services received by the donor is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. </i></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Nitty-Gritty of the Numbers</h3>
<p>It's going to cost us about $8,500 to mount our 2017 season - four original productions, four performances each. Add to that rehearsals to get us to where we need to be to produce the professional quality improvised theater that we love to create and share with our audience.</p>
<p>In 2016, our total expenses came to $6,729 for four productions. Inflation, right? This year, while the cost for rehearsal space remains the same ($240), our theater rental and tech costs have increased from $820 last year to $1,020 this year. Plus, for 2017, we've hired a fantastic PR company to promote our entire season, so we can continue to expand our audience and share what we love to do with even more people. </p>
<p>Here's a handy pie-chart to illustrate how we covered our expenses last year.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486081256/sezbrvnjsligqve9xjn6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That 13% shortfall comes to about $875. We'd love your support in making that disappear!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Do We Do It?</h3>
<p>Producing independent, improvised theater in New York City isn't easy, but we're entering our <i>sixth season</i> of doing it, and we're getting better and better every year. Although our core company is made up of the five folks you see pictured above, we certainly don't do it alone. Over the years we've cultivated strong working relationships with a wide variety of actors, musicians, directors, and people with expertise in technical and promotional fields that help make the whole thing function beautifully, not to mention making it a lot more fun!</p>
<p>Each of our productions features excellent improvisational actors beyond the ranks of our ensemble - we call them GIRTEs, or Guests of IRTE - to help us round out the cast. Every show also features a different local musical guest who we invite to perform during our musical break. Sometimes we even weave that musician's performance into the story we're creating. Hey, that's improv! Either way, it's a great opportunity for these talented musicians to share their music with a new audience.</p>
<p>Theater is truly a collaborative creation that demands the patience, skill, passion and talent of countless people, including (especially) those people we call our audience. Without you in the theater with us, we'd be up there playing just for ourselves. Likewise, without your generous contributions (of <i>any</i> amount) we'd have a much harder time doing what we do, and we'd have fewer opportunities to share it with other people, performers and audience members alike.</p>

</div></div>","We Are IRTE
Hello and welcome to IRTE's 2017 Season fundraising campaign!
We are the Improvisational Repertory Theatre Ensemble, a New York City-based, award-winning company of improvisational actors, producers, and creators of original, character-driven, improvisational comedy theater. Over the past five years we have conceived, developed, created, and performed about two dozen distinct productions.
In 2017, we embark on our sixth season, and we're excited to bring to our audiences 4 very different productions, including 3 brand new shows: The Sense-ations!, The Experiment, and Avoidance!; and for the first time ever, a sequel to last season's hilarious original show - Big, Rich & Powerful - BRP II !
 
IRTE 2017 Ensemble

Robert Baumgardner, Jamie Maloney, William Berg, Nannette Deasy, Curt Dixon
 

Your Contributions Make a Difference
Just as large performing arts organizations all over the country depend on contributions from an ever-expanding pool of committed sponsors, IRTE counts on the support of our audience not just at the theater attending our shows, but also as champions of our success behind the scenes as financial contributors.
At IRTE, we tend to each and every aspect of producing a full season of original theatrical productions. This includes renting rehearsal and performance space, paying directors and tech crew, promoting our shows, attending festivals both in New York City and out of state, insurance and overhead, etc.
Thanks to the generous support of people like you, IRTE has continued to prosper year after year in the very competitive theater market that is New York City. Never underestimate the value of even the smallest contribution you can make!
IRTE 2017 is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-­profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of IRTE 2017 must be made payable to “Fractured Atlas” only. Any contribution above the value of the goods and services received by the donor is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. 

 
The Nitty-Gritty of the Numbers
It's going to cost us about $8,500 to mount our 2017 season - four original productions, four performances each. Add to that rehearsals to get us to where we need to be to produce the professional quality improvised theater that we love to create and share with our audience.
In 2016, our total expenses came to $6,729 for four productions. Inflation, right? This year, while the cost for rehearsal space remains the same ($240), our theater rental and tech costs have increased from $820 last year to $1,020 this year. Plus, for 2017, we've hired a fantastic PR company to promote our entire season, so we can continue to expand our audience and share what we love to do with even more people. 
Here's a handy pie-chart to illustrate how we covered our expenses last year.

That 13% shortfall comes to about $875. We'd love your support in making that disappear!
 

How Do We Do It?
Producing independent, improvised theater in New York City isn't easy, but we're entering our sixth season of doing it, and we're getting better and better every year. Although our core company is made up of the five folks you see pictured above, we certainly don't do it alone. Over the years we've cultivated strong working relationships with a wide variety of actors, musicians, directors, and people with expertise in technical and promotional fields that help make the whole thing function beautifully, not to mention making it a lot more fun!
Each of our productions features excellent improvisational actors beyond the ranks of our ensemble - we call them GIRTEs, or Guests of IRTE - to help us round out the cast. Every show also features a different local musical guest who we invite to perform during our musical break. Sometimes we even weave that musician's performance into the story we're creating. Hey, that's improv! Either way, it's a great opportunity for these talented musicians to share their music with a new audience.
Theater is truly a collaborative creation that demands the patience, skill, passion and talent of countless people, including (especially) those people we call our audience. Without you in the theater with us, we'd be up there playing just for ourselves. Likewise, without your generous contributions (of any amount) we'd have a much harder time doing what we do, and we'd have fewer opportunities to share it with other people, performers and audience members alike.

 
Our 2017 Season!
The five of us at IRTE got together and struggled through the daunting task of paring down 36 excellent show pitches to the 4 we're presenting in our regular season this year. We are all very excited about the variety of ideas we're going to shape into full-fledged productions. Here they are!

<h3>8 Elements™ Intensive 1: Initiation</h3>
<p>I need your help, pretty please...! </p>
<p>My name is Valerie Bravo Woodruff and I am currently a FatChanceBellyDance® Sister Studio and teach American Tribal Style® Belly Dance in Colorado Springs, CO on the weekends. My passion for learning and teaching dance makes me a perpetual student. In order for me to become the best teacher, I must take my education further by studying with the best of the best. I have a full time day job that recently cut my hours and now I am having a hard time paying my way for this Intensive in March 2014.</p>
<p> I typically do not like asking for help, as I pride myself in paying my own way. However, my passion for dance is setting my pride aside- I really would like to take advantage of this rare and much sought after opportunity. I have a desire to study Tribal Fusion with Rachel Brice so that I have a better understanding of it. I want to improve my movement quality. I also want to help Tribal Fusion students that are now learning ATS® belly dance differentiate the Tribal Fusion movements rooted from the ATS® vocabulary. </p>
<p>I believe in challenging myself and my students. By studying Tribal Fusion and diving deep into choreography, history, and music theory, I will definitely advance my dance knowledge.</p>
<p>If my goal for this campaign is not met, the money contributed will go to furthering my American Tribal Style® Belly Dance knowledge at the FatChanceBellyDance® Studio in San Francisco, California</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I need and really don't want to ask for</h3>
<p>The Breakdown of what I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>$320 for the 2nd installment for tuition for 8 Elements™ Intensive 1: Initiation Rachel Brice's Eight Elements Initiation </li>
<li>$500 for the round-trip flight from Colorado Springs to Portland</li>
<li>$680 for lodging for 6 nights at the Paramount Hotel - not including meals</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<h3>Every little bit helps</h3>
<p>Seriously, I can't thank you enough.</p>

MAY VIOLETS SPRING is a new play adapted primarily from Shakespeare's Hamlet but featuring many of the Bard of Avon's other plays and sonnets, along with the introduction of original verse by James Parenti.

It's a love letter to classical heroines slighted by the narratives of our past and too often also in productions of the present.The play will run this upcoming April 16th through April 27th, 2014 at The Bridge Theatre in Shetler Studios and we need your help!our budgetFor full transparency, you'll find laid out below everything that's going into our budget for this production.

<p>We are thrilled to tell you a bit about ourselves, and our new show, <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">No Belles</i>.  And, to ask for your help. </p>
<p>So, here's the question that we started with:  what do you do if you want to face your fears, build something new, and create good art?  </p>
<p>Portal Theatre is a new company which focuses on original works on a broad (and fun!) range of topics.  We're based in Oregon.  When we started the company, we really wanted to make an impact with our very first outing.  Go big or go home, right?  So, we're going big (and, we need your help!) by taking our very first show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.  Did I mention that we need your help?</p>
<p>Our show is <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">No Belles</i>, which tells the stories of some remarkable women scientists.  Here's a statistic you should care about:  out of the 566 individual people who have won Nobel Prizes in the sciences, only 15 have been women.  Only fifteen!  That's less than 3%. And, most of them you've probably never heard of.  Hearing their stories will open your eyes to the passion and dedication of these women, and the very real changes and benefits they've brought to your life.  (We're also including some women that didn't win the Prize, but maybe should have).  </p>
<p>We're so happy to be performing the show this summer at the Sweet Grassmarket venue at the Edinburgh Fringe, the largest arts festival in the world.  It's a great opportunity.  But, we need your help.  As you can imagine, it's expensive to take a show to the Fringe.  See below for more details about our budget, and how you can help us out by donating to the cause!</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This show represents a real investment in the future of the company.  We (obviously) believe in the arts, but it's a reality that no theatre company can exist without the support of friends who believe in it.  We're inviting you to join us in this grand adventure by giving, in whatever amount you can, in support of the company and our trip to Edinburgh.  Here are some details:</p> <ul>
<li>We've included our full budget below, but for this campaign we're essentially looking to cover the cost of flights for the five company members from Portland to Edinburgh - about $7,500.  That's not nearly the entire cost of the project, but it represents a significant expense.</li> <li>We've got a number of nice perks for you, depending on the amount given!  Just check out the right side of this page for all the details.  <b>Please note:  any gifts that are mailed out will be sent in early September, after we return from Scotland.</b>  </li>
<li>So, what happens if the amount raised is below (or above) the requested amount?  We're using Flexible Funding for the campaign, which means that even if we don't quite reach the goal, any funds raised will still be put to good use!  And, if we raise more than our stated goal of $7,500, so much the better!  (See the budget below for the total costs of the project.)</li>
<li>Finally, we operate under a 501c3, which means that your gifts are tax deductible!  (Portal Theatre is associated with Western Oregon University, who will process all of our donations.)  Win/win, right?</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Budget</h3> <p>Your contribution, in whatever amount, is really important to us.  And, we thank you in advance for believing in the company, the show, and for your support for the arts.  We couldn't do it without you.  For your info, below is a breakdown of our budget.  Some of it is still estimates (advertising and printing, for example) since we haven't paid for that yet.  But, everything else is pretty darned accurate.</p> <ul>
<li>Venue rental at the Edinburgh Fringe:  $4,660</li> <li>Housing for the company in Edinburgh:  $7,699</li> <li>Flights for 5 to Edinburgh:  $7920</li>
<li>Fringe Fees:  $494</li>
<li>Marketing, Advertising and Printing (approx.):  $1,125</li>
<li><b>Subtotal:  $21,898</b></li> </ul>
<div>We've received an initial grant of $3,500, and, of course, we will be selling tickets for the show at the Fringe.  Given the average, we think we can make about $7,000 in ticket sales.  (It could be more or less.)  So, that means:</div>

<p>But, we also realize that some of you may not be able to give financially.  No problem!  There are other ways you can really help us out:</p> <ul>

<p>By Jove Theatre
Company is a London based theatre ensemble that re-works myth, legend and
stories from the cultural canon for 21st century Britain.  Founded in
2011, the company has pursued a number of different projects including a
feminist reinterpretation of Aeschylus' <i>Oresteia</i> and a pantomime version of
Jane Austen's classic novel <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. </p>
<p><i>Othello</i> is By Jove's first venture into
Shakespeare and allows us to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing
Britain today.  Shakespeare's classic play about prejudice, passion and
betrayal is re-worked against the backdrop of the debate surrounding Britain's
recent same sex marriage bill.  Othello is recast as a lesbian working in
Britain's military and she is about to enter into one of Britain's first same sex
marriages. Featuring new text in creative tension with Shakespeare's dialogue
we retell this tale to ask questions about how misogyny, homophobia and
racism can collude to bring about an all too real tragedy.
 As a company we are committed to raising awareness of important
political issues facing us today including domestic violence, cultural homophobia
and systemic racism. We believe this project addresses all three. </p>
<p>The money raised
through Indiegogo will go towards the purchase of essential props, costumes and
set pieces. This will make all the difference in allowing us to create a
compelling piece of theatre and illustrate this story as best as possible.  At this point in the production
we have assigned £200 to costume, £200 to set and £100 to props, as guidelines
figures within the overall £500.  However, the exact distribution may
change as the project develops. </p>
<p>We offer a range of perks to our sponsors. With a donation of £50 or more, you will not only receive two tickets to the play, you will also be invited to
attend our press and publicity evening on August 12th. This includes a drinks
reception and an opportunity to mingle with the cast, crew, industry
professionals and members of the press. </p>
<p>Your contribution would not only mean
the world to us, and make all the difference to our production, but would help
support emerging artists in an industry where funding is scarce. </p>

 As a company we are committed to raising awareness of important
political issues facing us today including domestic violence, cultural homophobia
and systemic racism. We believe this project addresses all three. 
The money raised
through Indiegogo will go towards the purchase of essential props, costumes and
set pieces. This will make all the difference in allowing us to create a
compelling piece of theatre and illustrate this story as best as possible.  At this point in the production
we have assigned £200 to costume, £200 to set and £100 to props, as guidelines
figures within the overall £500.  However, the exact distribution may
change as the project develops. 
We offer a range of perks to our sponsors. With a donation of £50 or more, you will not only receive two tickets to the play, you will also be invited to
attend our press and publicity evening on August 12th. This includes a drinks
reception and an opportunity to mingle with the cast, crew, industry
professionals and members of the press. 
Your contribution would not only mean
the world to us, and make all the difference to our production, but would help
support emerging artists in an industry where funding is scarce.

ROMEO and JULIET
Empirical Rogue has teamed up with chashama to produce a revolutionary, four-actor Romeo and Juliet in an exciting, never-performed-in, abandoned space in Long Island City. 
Just one block from Court Square (E,M,7,G trains), 26-15 Jackson Avenue was emptied out less than a year ago to be demolished for a new highrise (the 50-story Citigroup building is right next door). The space is still empty, and chashama has opened it up for our explosive version of Romeo and Juliet to run May 19th through June 10th.
Romance, politics, fighting, revenge, passion, music, and revolution. 
Oh, and cheap drinks!





 
THE IMPACT
Romeo and Juliet is about what it takes to change the world, and what happens when people have the courage to do that. We're trying to do the same thing, and so their story is our story. And yours.
1,500 people will experience this production. We're going to bring friends, artists, students, businesspeople, families, kids, and YOU to this space. We're going to perform this piece sixteen times. And then after two months, it will all come down.
We're going to completely reinvent this space with our Romeo and Juliet. In a few years, the building will be demolished. And another highrise will go up.
Help us make this Romeo and Juliet happen, and let's cherish an opportunity to change the world. They don't come along often!




WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
Check out all the perks to the right. Seats, VIP tickets, Limited Edition merchandise, Producing credits, etc. etc.
We want you to come see this thing, and we want you to take pride in having helped out.
We'll give you some stuff to show off, and we'll treat you right!


SO WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
Rent
Our space is curated by chashama, a not-for-profit that finds abandoned spaces all around New York City and rents them to artists. An average 65-seat theater in New York City rents for around $2500-$3500 per week. 
We're renting our chashama space for two solid months for just $3,000.   Total!
That means we'll rehearse, build, tech, and perform, all in the same space. The accumulated creativity and energy will be astounding.

 
Materials
We're lighting, costuming, building, and propping this bad boy in the most bare-bones, downtown, elbow-grease way possible.
We've all spent time in New York, Moscow, New Haven, Boston, and Seattle doing this kind of ground-up theater. It's cheap, it's dirty, it's exhilarating, and it creates the rawest, most powerful stuff you will ever see.

Food Money!
Everyone that works on this production will get a paycheck. Each one is modest, and they're all about the same amount.
There are four brilliant Actors, one excellent Musician, a Producer/Director, a Production Designer, an Associate Production Designer, a Technical Director, a Costume Designer, a Fight Director, a Stage Manager, an Assistant Stage Manager, a House Manager, and a Press Representative. All of them are essential, and most of them are taking on extra duties.
That's a 15-person team, working for less than minimum wage, to bring you an unforgettable experience.

 
Students
We want to bring this show to local NYC-area high-school students. We want to bring them to the space to experience the most cutting-edge, avant-garde classical theater happening. Then, we want to bring our actors and creative staff into schools to teach them about our new take on Shakespeare and this play.
With your help, we can make this show not only a brilliant artistic success, but an invaluable educational tool.

Running a not-for-profit is no easy task!

$25,000 is a lot of money, but once you factor in all the elements involved in producing theatre in New York, you'll see that the numbers add up quickly: $12,000 (Theatre Rent) + $5,000 (Actor Salaries) + $4,000 (Set, Costumes, Lights) + $2,000 (Marketing) + $1,000 (Insurance) + $1,000 (Rehearsal Space).

<em>""a modern-dance choreographer with a piquant imagination and visual sense to match""</em>  Jennifer Dunning, The New York Times</h3>
<p> </p>
<div><strong>Hi Everybody! Great news!</strong></div>
<p>My company was invited to participate on a month-long space grant @chashama to develop a new piece in July at their venue 'Anita's Way' - the pedestrian through-block connecting 42nd and 43rd Street, between Broadway and 6th Ave. <strong>And I need your support!</strong></p>
<p>I am creating <strong>Architecture Runway</strong>, a new piece for 10 dancers with live percussion by Jay Rosen. The piece is inspired by the architectural feel and energy of the space as it affects me.</p>
<p>I am very excited about this project because I have been interested in creating works for different spaces and this is an opportunity to investigate new possibilities.</p>
<p>There will be two <strong>FREE</strong> performances: July 26 and 27 @ 1 PM.</p>
<p><strong>Your generous contribution will help me achieve my goal of providing fees to everyone involved in this exciting project!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Here is the breakdown:</strong></p>
<p>10 dancers @ 300 each = 3,000</p>
<p>Musician, photographer, videographer @ 300 each = 900</p>
<p>Costume designer = 300</p>
<p>Video editor (promo DVD and final excerpt @ 250 = 500)</p>
<p>Other costs related to project (programs, fees, transportation of instruments) = 300</p>
<p>Total project cost $5,000</p>
<p><strong>How you can get involved:</strong></p>
<p>You can get involved by making a donation. Starting at $10 and up to as much as you would like to contribute, all funds are going toward the project. Each donation corresponds to a perk such as a photo from the Company, a CD, or a private dance class.</p>
<p><strong>The impact:</strong></p>
<p>After <strong><em>Architecture Runway</em></strong> premieres, it is our intention to take the piece to other cities and venues, as well as internationally. Your name will be posted as a contributor in the program.</p>
<p>We have recently toured twice to Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), and we hope to bring <strong><em>Architecture Runway</em> </strong>there.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping it up:</strong></p>
<p>Creating art and especially dance is not an easy task these days. But I get inspired at every rehearsal, working with these beautiful dancers. We all do it because we are fascinated with movement, form, and aesthetics, and it is too much fun! We look at the world through these lenses and love to bring the final product to you, the audience.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and for your generous support!</p>

<h2><strong><em>Mr. and Mrs.</em> Workshop Production</strong></h2>
<p>Cathy (the director) and I (Connie, the playwright) are excited about this latest version of my play, <em>Mr. and Mrs</em>. The play explores the nature of a friendship which crosses barriers of culture, generation, self-deception, and personal mythology.</p>
<p>Cathy directed a staged reading at the University of Washington last January, which sent me back to refining, elaborating, and rewriting. Now we're ready to give the play a more in-depth exploration in a workshop production in late fall of 2012.</p>
<h3>Our Backgrounds</h3>
<p>Cathy and I previously collaborated on my play, <em>Joan: In Her Own Voice</em>, about Joan of Arc during her months of imprisonment, in a production at the University of Washington School of Drama. Reviews were very positive, including Joe Bolling's Theater Puget Sound ranking the production in the top 5% of shows he reviewed that year.</p>
<p>Cathy is a master of helping actors apply the principles of the Alexandar Technique to their performances, and teaches in the Professional Actors Training Program at the University of Washington. Her directing experience includes many original works, and she brings a subtle and perceptive understanding to her directing.</p>
<p>Connie is an award-winning screenwriter, but has focused on playwriting for many years, including working as an artist-in-residence in a Seattle public school for three years, guiding 5th graders in developing original plays for graduation, as well as serving as writer, director, and performer for numerous productions at the annual Women of Wisdom conference.</p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>The staged reading process was very quick with just a few hours of rehearsal before the reading. Nevertheless, the characters jumped off the page, and as one audience member said, ""I couldn't believe how many people were crying at the end.""</p>
<p>A workshop production, fully realized, will further the development of the play. Connie will attend the rehearsals while Cathy leads the actors in exploring the material scene-by-scene through text analysis, improvisation, and other exercises. This, coupled with in-the-moment rewriting, is essential for honing the unity of the action, dialogue, and theme.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While we are experts at producing exciting theater on a shoestring budget, and the venue will provide in-kind donations of lighting, costumes, and rehearsal and performance space, we need your help for props and set pieces and for actor stipends. The more we raise, the more we can pay the actors, and the more fully we can realize our vision!</p>
<p>A special, and magical, element of the set, and leit-motif of the piece, are <strong>Wisteria</strong> <strong>Vines</strong>, which will grow, blossom, and fade during the play. This will enhance audience members appreciation for the passage of time (scenes occur in post-WWII East Germany, and contemporary Seattle over a period of two decades).</p>
<p>We need at least $500 (more will be super fantastic!) to pay for props, set pieces, marketing, programs, and actor stipends.</p>
<p>Your perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 A digital production photograph</li>
<li>$10 Name listed as donor in the program</li>
<li>$25 One comp ticket for the production in late autumn of 2012</li>
<li>$50 Two comp tickets plus a piece of the wisteria</li>
<li>$75 One comp ticket and the opportunity to attend a rehearsal</li>
<li>$100 One comp ticket and a casual dinner for one with Connie and Cathy</li>
<li>$500 Two comp tickets plus fine dining for you and one guest with Connie and Cathy</li>

Hard Sparks champions the work  of early- to mid-career 
playwrights and actors for a diverse audience of urban  theatre-goers hungry for daring  performances of dangerous 
plays.
Hard Sparks
 provides its audience with a meaningful experience at a reasonable 
price, and does so without sacrificing the integrity of those who 
create it. Our artists are fairly compensated for their work. 
Always.
Hard Sparks sees
 rehearsal as development. We commit to playwrights and their plays by actually producing new 
works rather than allowing them to languish in developmental limbo.
Hard Sparks recognizes the importance of supporting fellow 
community-based organizations working to improve the lives of those in 
need.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>We are Claudia, Mara, Elena, Olivia, Vlad, Andrei, Maria, Alin and Ioana and we just started the rehearsals for the first 100% Romanian play in the West End, London. </p>
<p>Inspired by a real story found in the newspaper <i>Florida Observer</i>, Romanian-born playwright Saviana Stanescu’s <b><i>Aliens With Extraordinary Skills</i> </b>was produced in 2008 by Julia Miles Theatre in New York to great acclaim. <br/></p>
<p>We believe that this new project will create a bridge and establish a significant connection between a team of young Romanian actors and creators living in London and their community.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STORY </b></p>
<p><i>New York, the city where people are always busy and a bit ""zombie"", living the American Dream with their eyes-wide open 24/7 . Two immigrant clowns, a girl from Moldova and a boy from Russia, arrive here on fake visas as ""aliens with extraordinary abilities"" in the circus, struggling to get the precious Green Card in their almost empty pockets. </i></p>
<p><i>Nadia makes balloon animals in Central Park. Borat (an ill fated name coincidence that ruined his reputation) drives a yellow cab, talks over his mobile whilst driving and spends his tips at the most popular exotic dance club in Manhattan. </i></p>
<p><i>And in this big circus called Life, on a second-hand couch, the two meet Lupita and Bob.  </i></p>
<p><i>What’s next? Green Card, love or clown tricks? </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>TEAM </b></p>
<p><b>Claudia</b> is the producer of ""Tales Told In Romanian"", a theatre series which has presented in London for the last three years sell out shows and built a significant and vivid Romanian theatre community at Leicester Square Theatre.</p>
<p><b>Mara Lubens </b>is an upcoming film and theatre director with a background in commercials, music videos and short films in Romania and UK. She has previously worked with multi award winners directors like Radu Jude, Dominik Graf and Mike Elliot.  </p>
<p>We think it's now the time to produce our own theatre show</p>
<p>The new production will gather for the first time a Romanian cast and crew telling a universal story to a Romanian theatre audience living in London.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This would be the first 100% Romanian theatre show produced in London for a Romanian community. The show would have many runs in London and could tour to other cities in the UK and Romania. The cultural impact to communities living abroad would be significant as well as the bonding between different parts of the community. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello everyone!
We are Claudia, Mara, Elena, Olivia, Vlad, Andrei, Maria, Alin and Ioana and we just started the rehearsals for the first 100% Romanian play in the West End, London. 
Inspired by a real story found in the newspaper Florida Observer, Romanian-born playwright Saviana Stanescu’s Aliens With Extraordinary Skills was produced in 2008 by Julia Miles Theatre in New York to great acclaim. 
We believe that this new project will create a bridge and establish a significant connection between a team of young Romanian actors and creators living in London and their community.  

STORY 
New York, the city where people are always busy and a bit ""zombie"", living the American Dream with their eyes-wide open 24/7 . Two immigrant clowns, a girl from Moldova and a boy from Russia, arrive here on fake visas as ""aliens with extraordinary abilities"" in the circus, struggling to get the precious Green Card in their almost empty pockets. 
Nadia makes balloon animals in Central Park. Borat (an ill fated name coincidence that ruined his reputation) drives a yellow cab, talks over his mobile whilst driving and spends his tips at the most popular exotic dance club in Manhattan. 
And in this big circus called Life, on a second-hand couch, the two meet Lupita and Bob.  
What’s next? Green Card, love or clown tricks? 

TEAM 
Claudia is the producer of ""Tales Told In Romanian"", a theatre series which has presented in London for the last three years sell out shows and built a significant and vivid Romanian theatre community at Leicester Square Theatre.
Mara Lubens is an upcoming film and theatre director with a background in commercials, music videos and short films in Romania and UK. She has previously worked with multi award winners directors like Radu Jude, Dominik Graf and Mike Elliot.  
We think it's now the time to produce our own theatre show
The new production will gather for the first time a Romanian cast and crew telling a universal story to a Romanian theatre audience living in London.
CAST 


Elena Harding as Nadia is
a versatile actress, with extensive experience in theatre and film. On stage
she is known for Lady Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (The Cockpit), Hermione in ""A Winter’s Tale"" (Theatre
Mono) and Heather Peterson in ""Hamlet For Girls"" (Edinburgh Fringe). 



Olivia Popica as Lupita 
is
without a doubt a rising star, making her mark with impressive performances in
film, television and theatre. She has appeared in the BBC TV productions ""Holby
City"" and the BAFTA winning ""Glasgow Girls"", as well as in the popular American
TV show ""Tyrant"" on FX Channel and BBC Radio 4’s drama ""Tumanbay"".  


Vlad Troncea as Borat is a promising and charismatic young actor, who has
already received 4 awards for best lead actor in various Romanian theatre
festivals. He has worked with well-known directors such as Radu Afrim, Mihai
Maniutiu, Alexandru Darie and Nae Caranfil in various major theatres in Bucharest. 



Andrei Gliga as Bob is
a multi-talented actor who studied drama at West
London University. Since graduation in 2012, he has performed in five major
plays produced by the Queen Mary Theatre in Oradea, Romania, and in other two
roles at Arthur Cotterell Theatre in Kingston, London. 



Maria Alexe as Homeland Security Officer  has a vast on-stage experience and remarkable versatility. She has appeared in various theatre and film roles both in the UK and abroad, with the most recent credits including: High Priestess in 'Penthesilea' (Playades Theatre Company), Revenge in 'The Spanish Tragedy' (Lazarus Theatre Company) and Zena in 'The Godling' (Defiant Reality Theatre production at Etcetera Theatre). 



Alin Balascan as Homeland Security Officer  is a young rising star, who studied at the prestigious acting school East 15 and also with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He played Angus in 'Macbeth' at Shakespeare's Globe and appeared in Harold Pinter’s 'Night' and 'No man’s land' at Cockpit Theatre. In 2013 he made his debut in West End in 'In the Beginning Was the End'at Somerset House, in a double role that brought him encouraging comments in the London Evening Standard and the Guardian.

By giving people a barrier-free, no pressure experience in the arts. The monthly Crowbait Club Theatre Deathmatch is simple to understand yet hard to master. Audience members can submit a ten minute play, act, watch, in any combination. The plays and the actors are chosen at random. The playwright has two minutes to brief their cast and then it's go time. Ten plays are read over the course of the evening. At the end of the show, the audience votes for best actor and best play, and the winning play becomes part of the lineup for our annual short play festival: King of Crows.</p><p>Because to be in it, you have to win it. And anyone, ANYONE can come and be part of the excitement. It is not unheard of for a newcomer to walk in and win with a great script or give a terrific acting performance and take home the Best Actor award.</p><p>We have discovered that the audience is a very good judge indeed. They know what they like. And every year we take the scripts they have chosen and fully produce them in our notorious short play festival, King of Crows.</p><p>PLUS, because The Crowbait Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the portion of your contribution that is above the value of any perk you select is tax-deductible!</p><br/><h2>King of Crows IV: All Hail The King</h2><p>King of Crows IV: All Hail The King will be held at the St Lawrence Arts Center, 76 Congress St, Portland, ME on September 8-11, 2016</p><p>We are asking for funding in the amount of $3,000. These funds will help us pay for the hall and a very small stipend for the actors, musicians, crew, and staff. Not to mention the countless small expenses that occur in mounting a creative endeavor like this: funny hats, lighting gel, gaffers tape, strange props and the like. Whether the goal is met, exceeded, or not, all funds will be used for production expenses or saved for King of Crows V.</p><p>3,000 dollars covers about 40% of the show's cost. The rest is funded by saved funds from previous King of Crows shows and our monthly Deathmatches. Crowbait Club runs a tight ship financially: it's five directors are not paid and they even pay out of their own pockets every month for the silly prizes awarded to the Deathmatch winners.</p><p>What about perks? We've got them! Simple and to the point. Give $35 and get two tickets to your show of choice. This perk includes a $5 donation to the cause and our heartfelt gratitude for your support. $50 gets you KOC IV's ""Orange King"" poster beautifully designed by Artistic Director Jody McComan. $100 is the price for the poster signed by the company and two tickets to the show of your choice. The tip top is $200: you get two tickets to the show of your choice, the poster signed by the company AND the legendary original Deathmatch logo T-shirt designed by founder Cullen McGough in your size.</p><p>PLUS....there is a secret perk available if you have the link. Drop us a line and we'll send it to you.</p><p>What's not to love?<br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Why Should I Care?</h2><p>Because we care.  And caring is important.</p><p>Because we are passionate about playwriting, acting and all the associated crafts the theater contains.</p><p>Because in 2012, three artists came together to figure out a way to make an arts opportunity accessible to anyone who wanted to try it. And they did it. With their own time and out of their own pockets. It's a party, it's an instantaneous literary event, it's cutting edge theatre and it's a chance to try something new and different without any barriers whatsoever.</p><p>People measure success in different ways. We are proud that our Deathmatches have generated over 600 new ten minute plays. We are proud that some of these plays have found production not only in King of Crows but in festivals and theaters from coast to coast. We are proud that actors whose first experience on the stage was at Crowbait Club are now working actors in our community.</p><p>We are proud that we can do this cheaply and effectively. The cost of admission to a Deathmatch is $5.00. Five dollars. To write, act, watch or all three. When we say we want to kick down barriers to participation in the arts, we absolutely mean it.</p><p>Do you love the arts? Then please consider a donation so we can continue doing what we do.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>That's the pitch. Thanks for reading it. We understand that sometimes money is tight. If you can't contribute to the cause, please talk us up, share this campaign with the IndieGoGo tools or like our page on Facebook.

By giving people a barrier-free, no pressure experience in the arts. The monthly Crowbait Club Theatre Deathmatch is simple to understand yet hard to master. Audience members can submit a ten minute play, act, watch, in any combination. The plays and the actors are chosen at random. The playwright has two minutes to brief their cast and then it's go time. Ten plays are read over the course of the evening. At the end of the show, the audience votes for best actor and best play, and the winning play becomes part of the lineup for our annual short play festival: King of Crows.Because to be in it, you have to win it. And anyone, ANYONE can come and be part of the excitement. It is not unheard of for a newcomer to walk in and win with a great script or give a terrific acting performance and take home the Best Actor award.We have discovered that the audience is a very good judge indeed. They know what they like. And every year we take the scripts they have chosen and fully produce them in our notorious short play festival, King of Crows.PLUS, because The Crowbait Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the portion of your contribution that is above the value of any perk you select is tax-deductible!King of Crows IV: All Hail The KingKing of Crows IV: All Hail The King will be held at the St Lawrence Arts Center, 76 Congress St, Portland, ME on September 8-11, 2016We are asking for funding in the amount of $3,000. These funds will help us pay for the hall and a very small stipend for the actors, musicians, crew, and staff. Not to mention the countless small expenses that occur in mounting a creative endeavor like this: funny hats, lighting gel, gaffers tape, strange props and the like. Whether the goal is met, exceeded, or not, all funds will be used for production expenses or saved for King of Crows V.3,000 dollars covers about 40% of the show's cost. The rest is funded by saved funds from previous King of Crows shows and our monthly Deathmatches. Crowbait Club runs a tight ship financially: it's five directors are not paid and they even pay out of their own pockets every month for the silly prizes awarded to the Deathmatch winners.What about perks? We've got them! Simple and to the point. Give $35 and get two tickets to your show of choice. This perk includes a $5 donation to the cause and our heartfelt gratitude for your support. $50 gets you KOC IV's ""Orange King"" poster beautifully designed by Artistic Director Jody McComan. $100 is the price for the poster signed by the company and two tickets to the show of your choice. The tip top is $200: you get two tickets to the show of your choice, the poster signed by the company AND the legendary original Deathmatch logo T-shirt designed by founder Cullen McGough in your size.PLUS....there is a secret perk available if you have the link. Drop us a line and we'll send it to you.What's not to love?Why Should I Care?Because we care.  And caring is important.Because we are passionate about playwriting, acting and all the associated crafts the theater contains.Because in 2012, three artists came together to figure out a way to make an arts opportunity accessible to anyone who wanted to try it. And they did it. With their own time and out of their own pockets. It's a party, it's an instantaneous literary event, it's cutting edge theatre and it's a chance to try something new and different without any barriers whatsoever.People measure success in different ways. We are proud that our Deathmatches have generated over 600 new ten minute plays. We are proud that some of these plays have found production not only in King of Crows but in festivals and theaters from coast to coast. We are proud that actors whose first experience on the stage was at Crowbait Club are now working actors in our community.We are proud that we can do this cheaply and effectively. The cost of admission to a Deathmatch is $5.00. Five dollars. To write, act, watch or all three. When we say we want to kick down barriers to participation in the arts, we absolutely mean it.Do you love the arts? Then please consider a donation so we can continue doing what we do.Other Ways You Can HelpThat's the pitch. Thanks for reading it. We understand that sometimes money is tight. If you can't contribute to the cause, please talk us up, share this campaign with the IndieGoGo tools or like our page on Facebook.

</h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Jude Beringer thinks she’s going mad.  Then she meets Leon, a young card magician who can make people disappear.

<h3><br/></h3><h3>Why is this show important? </h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As a company we feel very strongly that this story needs to be told as it is so representative of the thoughts, problems and anxieties that we both personally experience and see in the lives of our contemporaries.</span></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We think that the play’s thematic exploration of mental health - of different viewpoints towards mental illnesses, their diagnoses and treatments - makes it a very important contemporary play, as mental illnesses are being diagnosed at an increasing rate in the UK. This exploration in turn leads to an exploration of broader notions of reality and perception, all within the framework of what is of is still a heartwarming and hopeful story.</span></p>

<h3>The Writer</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Ben Maier is a writer and performer. He recently co-wrote and provided songs for <i>A Dashing Fellow</i> (New Diorama). Other credits include extensive work with Skinnybone Theatre and Wireless Mystery Theatre in Belfast.

<h3>The Money</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We feel confident that the play will be a success in Edinburgh, but it is a very costly endeavor, and we have a lot of fundraising to do in order to get it there! The production has been philanthropic in the past – we presented an extract of the play at a charity festival for the <a href=""http://www.bigissue.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Issue Foundation</a> and raised money for the <a href=""http://www.youngminds.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young Mind</a> charity throughout our October run, but London Grey &amp; Green currently receives no public funding and we now need to ask for financial assistance ourselves. </span></p><p align=""center""></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1398574/files/20150420045642-BL_Pie_-_Income.jpg?1429531002"" src="""" style=""width: 420.119px; height: 253px;""/></p><p align=""center""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1398576/files/20150420045657-BL_Pie_-_Expenditure.jpg?1429531017"" src="""" style=""width: 419.591px; height: 357px;""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As you can see, our budget is pretty conservative, and all of our dedicated cast and crew are involved on a voluntary basis.  We will, of course, support our team members that will be living in Edinburgh for the duration of the festival (one month), by paying for their travel and accomodation.  <b>If we hit our goal of £2,500 this will cover the bulk of our accomodation costs.</b><br/></span></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our team work really hard so if we exceed our funding goal any extra money will go to our actors and stage manager to help towards their living costs while in Edinburgh.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We think that the important themes of this production mean that it deserves a life beyond the festival.. If our run goes as well as we are hoping, we will use the momentum to tour the show to more theatres, but also to schools - so that young people who may have seen little experimental theatre can experience it and so we can spark discussions with them about the realities of mental illnesses.</span>

Rather than scenes and acts, A Sudden Burst of Blinding Light is innovatively structured around a series of games and challenges.  Within these, the actors are given flexibility, engaging directly with the audience and encouraging their participation. Every performance is unique, entailing an element of chance and relishing in its own liveness.  We use a variety of performance techniques from naturalism to surrealism.  The production also contains an original score composed by Patrick Goodden, live song and dance.

As a company we feel very strongly that this story needs to be told as it is so representative of the thoughts, problems and anxieties that we both personally experience and see in the lives of our contemporaries.

We think that the play’s thematic exploration of mental health - of different viewpoints towards mental illnesses, their diagnoses and treatments - makes it a very important contemporary play, as mental illnesses are being diagnosed at an increasing rate in the UK. This exploration in turn leads to an exploration of broader notions of reality and perception, all within the framework of what is of is still a heartwarming and hopeful story.

The Writer
Ben Maier is a writer and performer. He recently co-wrote and provided songs for A Dashing Fellow (New Diorama). Other credits include extensive work with Skinnybone Theatre and Wireless Mystery Theatre in Belfast. His one-man show An Imaginary Circus, produced by Belka Productions, recently commenced a UK tour.

The Director
Charlie's recent directing credits include: Cyber-babies (Park Theatre), The Seaside, A Little While Longer (Hen & Chickens), 82 to North Finchley, Fit For Work (Rosemary Branch); as co-director: The King of Cats (Secret Garden Party). She was selected for a week-long workshop with acclaimed theatre director Katie Mitchell, 
organised by the Young Vic.  Charlie also has 
professional
experience as a choreographer, producer and stage manager, at venues including New Diorama, Pleasance and Southwark Playhouse.
The Company
London Grey & Green was founded in 2013 by Berengere Ariaudo de Castelli, Charlie Ely and Tessa Shrubsall, after
the three met and bonded whilst studying at
the Royal Central School of Speech & Drama.  The theatre that we make focuses on contemporary stories and exploring the world around us through imaginative and varied performance techniques.  We are interested in intelligent and provocative new writing and are also committed to producing work with at least 50% female representation.

We have independently produced three successful week-long shows on the London fringe and been invited to perform our work at two arts festivals: Secret Garden Party and The Big Noise Festival.

The Money
We feel confident that the play will be a success in Edinburgh, but it is a very costly endeavor, and we have a lot of fundraising to do in order to get it there! The production has been philanthropic in the past – we presented an extract of the play at a charity festival for the Big Issue Foundation and raised money for the Young Mind charity throughout our October run, but London Grey & Green currently receives no public funding and we now need to ask for financial assistance ourselves. As you can see, our budget is pretty conservative, and all of our dedicated cast and crew are involved on a voluntary basis.  We will, of course, support our team members that will be living in Edinburgh for the duration of the festival (one month), by paying for their travel and accomodation.  If we hit our goal of £2,500 this will cover the bulk of our accomodation costs.



Stretch Goal
Our team work really hard so if we exceed our funding goal any extra money will go to our actors and stage manager to help towards their living costs while in Edinburgh.

The Future
We think that the important themes of this production mean that it deserves a life beyond the festival.. If our run goes as well as we are hoping, we will use the momentum to tour the show to more theatres, but also to schools - so that young people who may have seen little experimental theatre can experience it and so we can spark discussions with them about the realities of mental illnesses.

Our company already works in schools delivering 'Play-in-a-Day' workshops. For more information, visit http://greyandgreentheatre.co.uk/play-in-a-day/If you'd like us to bring the show to where you are, please get in touch with us here!

</div>","""You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout? No, he's holding a three thousand pound Marlin.""-Social Network
I have been told by several industry professionals that if you can last past your fourth year, you can then make a plan to survive for many more years to come. So, here we are. We are well past five years and going strong. I am proud to say we have survived this long! I don't wish to have The District Theatre become something that once was; I want this to be an organization that survives. I want this theatre to become something the Quad Cities can not live without.

To date, the theatre has survived a slum lord and a musty, old bank building; a rebranding; a very tiring and strenuous move across the river; a small ""two car garage"" temporary space; a major financial crisis that left us with some serious debt; the rise and fall of a not-for-profit not unlike the story of 'Social Network' albeit on a smaller scale; small scandals on the local and national level; the rumor mill, which will be churning for years to come; battles with an owner's group who ""don't support the arts""; some major changes in the administration; and over forty productions ranging from Long Day's Journey Into Night to Sweeney Todd to Rent, not to mention six years of The Rocky Horror Show.

Since 2008, despite it's hardships and obstacles, has become one of the most acclaimed companies in the Quad Cities, known for its professional talent, hard hitting material and eloquent execution. It is my hope that, in the next year, we can not only continue that tradition, but also raise production values, build a larger subscriber base, and continue towards progress with an important capital campaign. 

In addition, and most importantly, it is necessary for the future of the theatre that establish an professional organization that will become a permanent fixture in the Quad Cities' artistic landscape.

People often ask, ""What are you still doing here, why are you still trying to make this work?"" This is the question I am asked most, and my response is always one of two things: my traditional ""Livin' the dream"" or ""why not?"" And yes, those two are correct, and I do feel that way, but it goes deeper than that. I love what I am able to do here and I love the people I get to work with. This is what I've always wanted to do. From the time I was old enough to speak, I produced plays, haunted houses and concerts in my parent's basement/backyard year after year. At age ten, I moved my operation to the public library once I discovered an unused back room and struck up a deal with the head librarian. I started producing things in the commercial market at age twenty and currently have over seventy five full scale productions and one Broadway investment to my name.
This is all I know. This is what I love. And I love this life and this job I have created. It is the definition of the American Dream. I built this from the ground up and have worked tirelessly to make sure this place survives. I have sacrificed several gigs, several important internships, several paychecks, personal relationships, and just about everything else I have to make sure this place survives. This ""little theatre"" is so much more to me. It is a life. It has become an important part of who I am, and who I will become. I am driven and motivated to become a leader not only in this community but in this industry.
There is nothing quite like it...

<p>I'm María Elena Villasmil (Loto Bello), together with my friends Hermmankis Parra (Lucía Bello) and Ricardo Lugo (Lía Bello), we put together about 100 years doing theater in our country Venezuela (although if you look at us closely, we do not seem “that” old :)).</p>
<p>We write ""Ellas Vienen de Maracaibo Show TV"", a comedy where 3 Venezuelan immigrants and the son of one of them (The Bello family), are talking about political and social issues of Venezuela at this very moment.</p>
<p>We were moved to write because of the countless threads of history of Venezuelan immigrants that are heard randomly on any street in Santiago, Lima, Buenos Aires, Bogotá, Guayaquil or Miami. You can hear stories of rushed farewells; you can hear the Venezuelan everlasting birthday’s song and you can also see people putting their best smile on the video call for their family not to know they are sad because they are gone, far away; you can see children without their mothers; fathers are seen working hard in another country, doing jobs differents of those they were used to do to send money to their families ""there"". ""There"" we do not know very well if it is a nightmare or a utopia.</p>
<p>Having the script done, we want to play and make a tour starting in Chile (where I am, Hermmankis and Ricardo are in Venezuela... that's the thing with the fucking Diaspora) to show through theater what happens in our country.</p>
<p><strong>For Hermmankis and Ricardo to reach Chile, we need 2 flight tickets Venezuela - Chile ( $1.000 +  $1.000 =  $2.000) as well as  $4.000 to start the general production (set design, costumes, puppet making, etc). so we are asking for $ 6,000! </strong></p>
<p>We know that we can rely on the help of our friends to achieve our goal. But beware, this is not a free help! We want you to become part of our effort and we want to be your voice (we have an elegant way to shout: Maduro, C’ETM!!!!).</p>
<p>For the help you give us you will have different perks (explained in the section ""perks"").</p>
<p>If you can not participate monetarily, we also receive the positive energy that you give us or the support by spreading our project among your networks. In advance, thanks a lot for the collaboration!</p>

<h3>Mr. Kotomoto Is Definitely Not White</h3>
<p>As Mr. Kotomoto's Teas expands to selling dreams, a manager’s offensive email forces three employees to navigate their compromised morals and changing friendships. <i>Mr. Kotomoto Is Definitely Not White </i>is about the struggle of needing to work in a system you do not enjoy in order to survive.</p>
<p>NoMads Art Collective is so excited for this to be our first ever fully produced, full month-long run of a play! <i>Kotomoto</i> is a powerful, immediate play, recognizable to anyone who has worked in the service industry. Running from March 29 - April 21, 2019 at Strawdog Theatre in Chicago, this play will be made available to as many people as possible. To make this show the best it can possibly be, and to pay our artists the amount they deserve, we need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who are NoMads?</h3>
<p>NoMads Art Collective was founded in 2013 by Ben Claus and Scott Jackoway. In 2018, NoMads changed focus to becoming a new play development company. We believe in development of work from its earliest forms to fully staged production. With our monthly play reading and art series, The Forge, and now this production of <i>Mr. Kotomoto Is Definitely Not White</i>, we work to embody our mission:</p>
<p>We, NoMads Art Collective, strive to develop new, experimental work. Our mission is to foster emerging artists as they grow to become the next turbulent American theatre. Our work often engages politics with absurdity as we complicate taboos and clichés⬅this is a cliché. We hope that through steadfast commitment to our art, we grow radical empathy in our audiences and ourselves.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Kotomoto Is Definitely Not White<i> </i></i>is the first fully staged play NoMads has produced in over a year. It has the longest run and biggest design team, and the artistic directors of NoMads Art Collective are leading the production together. Below you can learn a little bit about the artistic directors of NoMads and their role in <i>Mr. Kotomoto</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Claus (<i>Playwright</i>) is artistic director and resident playwright of NoMads Art Collective. Ben is a recent graduate from The Theatre School at DePaul's BFA Playwriting program, and has a minor in eastern religious studies as well. Along with writing plays, they also teach yoga and serve tea. </li>
<li>Scott Jackoway (<i>Director</i>)  is artistic director of NoMads Art Collective. He is a director, actor, and sometimes writer. His artistic roots come from the Experimental Theatre Wing at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he studied acting and grew his love of the absurd.</li>
<li>Danielle B. Szabo (<i>Dramaturg</i>) is artistic director and resident dramaturg for NoMads. She proudly hails from Flint, Michigan. She’s still looking for the right Snapchat filter to call home. She plans to hitchhike the galaxy, start a farm in Stardew Valley, and not panic.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Where does the $$$ go?</h3>
<p>A fully funded Indiegogo will cover up to 60-75% of our goal budget. After paying the necessary fees for our rental of Strawdog Theatre, rehearsal space, and design budgets, all the rest of the money we raise goes directly to paying our artists, designers, and technicians. We are planning to employ 5 designers, 4 actors, 1 stage manager, and 4 production assistants. That's a lot of people!</p>
<p>Below you can see two graphs, one which is the bare minimum we need to produce <i>Kotomoto, </i>the other our ideal budget with a successful fundraising campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543550185/hmjzlicuec3gu5dvoeii.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In the above graph, you can see that our rental of Strawdog Theatre comprises the largest percentage of our budget. The space rental takes up over half of our minimum budget of $9,000. We have already raised almost $2,500, meaning if this campaign raised around $6,000, we could confidently produce the play without having to borrow from potential ticket sales. However, if this campaign is fully successful, we are on our way towards hitting our goal budget:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543550549/ljqwxjlxze3xnp9nfpcx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You can see now that the largest expense is paying our artists and technicians, which is what we believe a theatrical budget should look like. We believe that our 14 collaborators deserve to be paid for the close to 1,000 labor hours it takes to mount a full production. This budget totals over $15,000, so even with a fully funded campaign we are relying on our grant proposals and other fundraising efforts in order to pay our artists the amount they deserve.</p>

She was born Feb 22, 1893 in Pawtucket, RI, and died on December 31, 1972 in NYC.</p><p>Amy’s family immigrated to the United States from Scotland in 1884 and settled in Pawtucket, R.I. She studied at Pawtucket High School where she wrote the words and music to her class ode. Her early training was for piano, with Felix Fox, concert pianist of Boston who established Fox-Buonamici School of Pianoforte in at 403 Marlborough Street in Boston's Back Bay. McKean advanced to specialize in voice and composition with Bainbridge Crist, composer, also of Boston. She later attended the Rhode Island School of Music and wrote for the violin, piano, and voice. She moved to NY in 1917 and lived at the Hotel Margaret, 95 Columbia Heights. She was a member of the National Arts Club in Gramercy Park, NYC and later became a member of the Poetry Society of America. She was involved with the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and was regularly published in their Bulletin. Amy married Alexander Mckean at the end of her first year living in New York and they had two children: Robert, and a daughter Elaine (who are frequently seen with her in Cambridge Court and Prospect Park enjoying nature). She performed in Boston, Providence, and in Manhattan and Brooklyn at the Tonkuenstler Society, The Three Arts Club, Salon of the Seven Arts, Jackson Heights Music Club, New York Assembly Hall, First Congregational Church in Clinton, Mass, Hotel Bossert, Great Northern Hotel, Hotel Margaret, Hotel St. George, Apollo Studios, Chateau Garden Club, Various locations with the Jackson Heights Chorale Group, The National Arts Club, on the radio on WBBC, on The Voice of the Firestone with Margaret Speaks on WOR New York, and many private residences.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582594459/eijsmfllargvfr0nfxri.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT THE COLLABORATORS</strong></p><p>Composer <strong>Charlie Griffin</strong> is launching a second career as a writer of fiction and creative non-fiction. He recently graduated valedictorian with a BFA in Creative Writing for Entertainment from Full Sail University. With a background in improv, comedy and film acting, Griffin employs lessons learned in those fields in his writing.

His work has been published by Flash Fiction Magazine, The Scarlet Leaf Review, ArtBorne Magazine, and Hidden Remote. He is a writer and publisher member of ASCAP. </p><p><i>“As soon as Mark Piszczek told me about his experience working with the music of Amy Upham McKean, I knew that there was a compelling story to be told there, and I was immediately curious to know what Amy's music sounded like. As director of the Central Florida Composers Forum, I knew we had a concert date reserved for March 2020, and already had my radar up for something fitting for Women's History Month. This project seemed more than perfect. Given the vision of the project as it grew, my experiences as a composer and a writer, along with my love of American 20th century cultural history, I was eager to inhabit Amy’s perspective. Amy’s life and rich story has been fertile ground indeed.”</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Mark Piszczek</strong> (b. 1957) is a professional composer and arranger who performs on both oboe and saxophone. Piszczek has a deep background in both jazz and classical composition and performance.  His recent orchestral work, Songs from the Gulf of Sorrows, was premiered by The Brevard Symphony Orchestra in 2016.</p><p><i>“I've loved working on this interesting historical, musicological project with Jamieson Thomson Thomas. I've transcribed, adapted and made audio files of hand written musical manuscripts, songs and scores composed by her great aunt, Amy Upham Thomson McKean between 1914 and 1939. Amy was quite a talent and lived a fascinating life. Jamieson is working on uncovering most of the history while I'm transcribing some sixty compositions. There may be even more if we can find them.There are boxes of undated musical manuscripts, letters, photos, old newspaper articles  and we’re systematically going through all of these trying to unravel the true and sometimes tragic story of her mysterious, enigmatic life. She faced the daunting challenges and prejudices that many gifted, artistic women of her era had to endure.” </i></p><p><strong>Jamieson Thomas,</strong> great niece of Amy Thomson McKean, is an artist who explores cultural and personal history and the intersection between humanity and the natural environment. Through painting, photography, video and sculptural installations her interdisciplinary work addresses our individual imprint on our surroundings and questions our role of dominance in the global ecosystem, and considers solutions that will lead to balance and coexistence. <a href=""http://www.jamiesonthomas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jamiesonthomas.com</a></p><p><i>“When I received Amy’s music from her ailing 91 yr. old daughter Elaine McKean Stumpf, I attempted to gather information about her mother but she struggled as she recounted her story and became sad. She hadn't heard the music since she was young, and desperately wanted to hear the music again. Mark Piszczek transcribed a dozen pieces and burned a CD for me to play on a CD player. As we sat and listening, she began to cry and said the memory was too painful to share any more of the story. From the little I learned before Elaine’s death, I knew that Amy was a vivacious woman who loved living in Brooklyn and the energy of the city. She embraced the women’s movement and performed her music actively, and that while loving, her father could be stern. Elaine mentioned her mother had been institutionalized twice for “nerves” and I realized that there was much more to the story and I wanted to know what silenced her music.”</i></p><p><strong>ABOUT THE PERFORMERS</strong></p><p>Actor Singer: Kelly Morris Rowan</p><p>Kelly Morris Rowan is a full-time vocalist at the Voices of Liberty in Epcot.

Our goal is to perform in New York September 2021, and other venues (especially Boston, MA or Providence, RI, where Amy lived and performed during her lifetime).  WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION SUPPORT?We have some terrific items to offer for your participation in this project. 
The transcription of Amy’s music.
Script writing of the story in Amy’s voice, as a ghost of the present representing her past.
The creation and preparation of the script
Hiring a professional actor/singer to play Amy in performance of script and music.  
Hiring six musicians to perform music. (piano, flute, clarinet, oboe, French horn, bassoon)

She was born Feb 22, 1893 in Pawtucket, RI, and died on December 31, 1972 in NYC.Amy’s family immigrated to the United States from Scotland in 1884 and settled in Pawtucket, R.I. She studied at Pawtucket High School where she wrote the words and music to her class ode. Her early training was for piano, with Felix Fox, concert pianist of Boston who established Fox-Buonamici School of Pianoforte in at 403 Marlborough Street in Boston's Back Bay. McKean advanced to specialize in voice and composition with Bainbridge Crist, composer, also of Boston. She later attended the Rhode Island School of Music and wrote for the violin, piano, and voice. She moved to NY in 1917 and lived at the Hotel Margaret, 95 Columbia Heights. She was a member of the National Arts Club in Gramercy Park, NYC and later became a member of the Poetry Society of America. She was involved with the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and was regularly published in their Bulletin. Amy married Alexander Mckean at the end of her first year living in New York and they had two children: Robert, and a daughter Elaine (who are frequently seen with her in Cambridge Court and Prospect Park enjoying nature). She performed in Boston, Providence, and in Manhattan and Brooklyn at the Tonkuenstler Society, The Three Arts Club, Salon of the Seven Arts, Jackson Heights Music Club, New York Assembly Hall, First Congregational Church in Clinton, Mass, Hotel Bossert, Great Northern Hotel, Hotel Margaret, Hotel St. George, Apollo Studios, Chateau Garden Club, Various locations with the Jackson Heights Chorale Group, The National Arts Club, on the radio on WBBC, on The Voice of the Firestone with Margaret Speaks on WOR New York, and many private residences. ABOUT THE COLLABORATORSComposer Charlie Griffin is launching a second career as a writer of fiction and creative non-fiction. He recently graduated valedictorian with a BFA in Creative Writing for Entertainment from Full Sail University. With a background in improv, comedy and film acting, Griffin employs lessons learned in those fields in his writing. In 2017 he wrote, produced and starred in his own show for the Orlando Fringe Festival. His work has been published by Flash Fiction Magazine, The Scarlet Leaf Review, ArtBorne Magazine, and Hidden Remote. He is a writer and publisher member of ASCAP. “As soon as Mark Piszczek told me about his experience working with the music of Amy Upham McKean, I knew that there was a compelling story to be told there, and I was immediately curious to know what Amy's music sounded like. As director of the Central Florida Composers Forum, I knew we had a concert date reserved for March 2020, and already had my radar up for something fitting for Women's History Month. This project seemed more than perfect. Given the vision of the project as it grew, my experiences as a composer and a writer, along with my love of American 20th century cultural history, I was eager to inhabit Amy’s perspective. Amy’s life and rich story has been fertile ground indeed.” Mark Piszczek (b. 1957) is a professional composer and arranger who performs on both oboe and saxophone. Piszczek has a deep background in both jazz and classical composition and performance.  His recent orchestral work, Songs from the Gulf of Sorrows, was premiered by The Brevard Symphony Orchestra in 2016.“I've loved working on this interesting historical, musicological project with Jamieson Thomson Thomas. I've transcribed, adapted and made audio files of hand written musical manuscripts, songs and scores composed by her great aunt, Amy Upham Thomson McKean between 1914 and 1939. Amy was quite a talent and lived a fascinating life. Jamieson is working on uncovering most of the history while I'm transcribing some sixty compositions. There may be even more if we can find them.There are boxes of undated musical manuscripts, letters, photos, old newspaper articles  and we’re systematically going through all of these trying to unravel the true and sometimes tragic story of her mysterious, enigmatic life. She faced the daunting challenges and prejudices that many gifted, artistic women of her era had to endure.” Jamieson Thomas, great niece of Amy Thomson McKean, is an artist who explores cultural and personal history and the intersection between humanity and the natural environment. Through painting, photography, video and sculptural installations her interdisciplinary work addresses our individual imprint on our surroundings and questions our role of dominance in the global ecosystem, and considers solutions that will lead to balance and coexistence. www.jamiesonthomas.com“When I received Amy’s music from her ailing 91 yr. old daughter Elaine McKean Stumpf, I attempted to gather information about her mother but she struggled as she recounted her story and became sad. She hadn't heard the music since she was young, and desperately wanted to hear the music again. Mark Piszczek transcribed a dozen pieces and burned a CD for me to play on a CD player. As we sat and listening, she began to cry and said the memory was too painful to share any more of the story. From the little I learned before Elaine’s death, I knew that Amy was a vivacious woman who loved living in Brooklyn and the energy of the city. She embraced the women’s movement and performed her music actively, and that while loving, her father could be stern. Elaine mentioned her mother had been institutionalized twice for “nerves” and I realized that there was much more to the story and I wanted to know what silenced her music.”ABOUT THE PERFORMERSActor Singer: Kelly Morris RowanKelly Morris Rowan is a full-time vocalist at the Voices of Liberty in Epcot. She also performs in various other shows at Disney and Universal. An accomplished regional theatre actress, renaissance faire performer, and cabaret songstress, she’s ever grateful for chances to tell a good story.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>From the company that brought Woody Guthrie Dreams to the stage at Theatre for the New City in Fall 2011. Written by Michael Patrick Flanagan Smith with Benjamin Forstenzer,  HISTRIONICS  is a one-person play starring Brendan Hines.</p>
<p>Smith and Forstenzer began writing the play in Baltimore back in 2001 during the second Bush administration, and now almost two decades later it is set to world premiere at TNC in New York City on November 30th and run for three weeks, closing December 17th, 2017.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the mid 1850's, when Buchanan was president, the country was a mess of internal turmoil; lines were drawn, and America was divided.  In HISTRIONICS, we look at that past, consider it in relationship to the present, and examine the ways in which actions today can have great repercussion in the future. In this technological age filled with unrest, political upheavals, and Twitter wars, a play's the thing to remind the world that history repeats itself!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>HISTRIONICS is being produced by Executive Director Crystal Field and Theater for the New City, who have donated performance and rehearsal space - valued at tens of thousands of dollars. Plus we’ve raised $3,500 already through private donations, we now we need $8,700 to cover the rest of the costs to produce this play.  This campaign will pay for costumes, the set, as well as our lighting and sound design.  It will cover the modest stipends we are offering to our excellent design team and incredibly talented actor, Brendan Hines. This campaign will pay for our fliers and press material so we can get the word out loud and clear about what we believe is a powerful &amp; important project.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
From the company that brought Woody Guthrie Dreams to the stage at Theatre for the New City in Fall 2011. Written by Michael Patrick Flanagan Smith with Benjamin Forstenzer,  HISTRIONICS  is a one-person play starring Brendan Hines.
Smith and Forstenzer began writing the play in Baltimore back in 2001 during the second Bush administration, and now almost two decades later it is set to world premiere at TNC in New York City on November 30th and run for three weeks, closing December 17th, 2017.

The Impact
In the mid 1850's, when Buchanan was president, the country was a mess of internal turmoil; lines were drawn, and America was divided.  In HISTRIONICS, we look at that past, consider it in relationship to the present, and examine the ways in which actions today can have great repercussion in the future. In this technological age filled with unrest, political upheavals, and Twitter wars, a play's the thing to remind the world that history repeats itself!
What We Need & What You Get
HISTRIONICS is being produced by Executive Director Crystal Field and Theater for the New City, who have donated performance and rehearsal space - valued at tens of thousands of dollars. Plus we’ve raised $3,500 already through private donations, we now we need $8,700 to cover the rest of the costs to produce this play.  This campaign will pay for costumes, the set, as well as our lighting and sound design.  It will cover the modest stipends we are offering to our excellent design team and incredibly talented actor, Brendan Hines. This campaign will pay for our fliers and press material so we can get the word out loud and clear about what we believe is a powerful & important project.

<h3>Daniel Gwirtzman Dance Company Makes Its Jacob's Pillow Debut</h3>
<p>The beautiful and universally-loved <a href=""http://www.jacobspillow.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival</a>, a National Historic Landmark, celebrates its 80th Anniversary this year. As <em>The New Yorker</em> recently proclaimed: ""There's no place like Jacob's Pillow.""  </p>
In this milestone season, <a href=""http://www.gwirtzmandance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Gwirtzman Dance Company</a>  is excited and proud to perform on the Pillow's magnificent Inside/Out stage.  The Pillow's geography, Western Massachusetts' Berkshire mountain range, provides a stunning backdrop to the performance. Says Artistic Director and choreographer Daniel Gwirtzman, an alum of the Pillow:
<p><em>As a young dancer I spent summers studying at the Pillow's famed school with legendary choreographers and teachers, and as a young professional I enjoyed summers performing in the Ted Shawn Theater, the Festival's indoor main stage.  The Pillow has a special place in my and many people's hearts, dancers and audiences alike.</em></p>
<p>The Company and its Board of Directors are reaching out for your support through an indiegogo campaign. </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Daniel says:</p>
<p><em>It has been of great interest for a long time to have the Company perform at The Pillow, a place very dear to my heart.  My formative years as a dancer and choreographer were shaped there. </em> <em>My work was presented on the Inside/Out stage in 1987; so much has happened since these student days.  How terrific to have this opportunity to present the Company in some of our most celebrated dances.</em></p>
<p>The Company's robust program features a dozen dancers and a dozen dances including the sweeping <em>Olympiad</em>, sensuous <em>Museum</em>, and highlights from our acclaimed show <em>Encore</em>.  The exuberance of the dancers and the joyful, wholesome dances uplift and educate.  The repertory is accessible and entertaining, dances an entire audience can enjoy.  A question and answer session with the audience will immediately follow.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>The Company launches this one-month campaign to raise the funds needed for the engagement.  It seems everywhere one looks there is a similar pitch for support.  Kickstarter and indiegogo campaigns are widespread; with the expansion of social media has come the nonstop superhighway of pleas and requests. </p>
<p>We observe that companies and artists often ask for the full amount of a project. </p>
<h3>Dance is Expensive</h3>
<p>We do not need all of our budget provided for by you, our potential supporters.  The Company is receiving an honorarium from The Pillow, although it is an amount that is dwarfed by our expenses. </p>
<p>That's one of the things that is so confounding about dance.  Even when one receives a prestigious engagement, it is rarely enough to cover expenses.  Dance is prohibitively expensive to produce.  It takes time for people to learn choreography, even at the highest professional level, as are the Company's dancers.  Time is expensive.  Dancers cost money and space costs money.  The Company is paying what it can from our general operating budget, but it is not enough.</p>
<p>A week out from the performance our costs continue to escalate.</p>
<p>Please read our most current funding update, under the Update tab, to understand how we are using the funds, and how additional funding will support the project.  This has been updated as of July 14.</p>
<h3>Thanks for Your Help</h3>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Daniel Gwirtzman Dance Company Makes Its Jacob's Pillow Debut
The beautiful and universally-loved Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, a National Historic Landmark, celebrates its 80th Anniversary this year. As The New Yorker recently proclaimed: ""There's no place like Jacob's Pillow.""  
In this milestone season, Daniel Gwirtzman Dance Company  is excited and proud to perform on the Pillow's magnificent Inside/Out stage.  The Pillow's geography, Western Massachusetts' Berkshire mountain range, provides a stunning backdrop to the performance. Says Artistic Director and choreographer Daniel Gwirtzman, an alum of the Pillow:
As a young dancer I spent summers studying at the Pillow's famed school with legendary choreographers and teachers, and as a young professional I enjoyed summers performing in the Ted Shawn Theater, the Festival's indoor main stage.  The Pillow has a special place in my and many people's hearts, dancers and audiences alike.
The Company and its Board of Directors are reaching out for your support through an indiegogo campaign. 
The Project
Daniel says:
It has been of great interest for a long time to have the Company perform at The Pillow, a place very dear to my heart.  My formative years as a dancer and choreographer were shaped there.  My work was presented on the Inside/Out stage in 1987; so much has happened since these student days.  How terrific to have this opportunity to present the Company in some of our most celebrated dances.
The Company's robust program features a dozen dancers and a dozen dances including the sweeping Olympiad, sensuous Museum, and highlights from our acclaimed show Encore.  The exuberance of the dancers and the joyful, wholesome dances uplift and educate.  The repertory is accessible and entertaining, dances an entire audience can enjoy.  A question and answer session with the audience will immediately follow.


The Campaign
The Company launches this one-month campaign to raise the funds needed for the engagement.  It seems everywhere one looks there is a similar pitch for support.  Kickstarter and indiegogo campaigns are widespread; with the expansion of social media has come the nonstop superhighway of pleas and requests. 
We observe that companies and artists often ask for the full amount of a project. 
Dance is Expensive
We do not need all of our budget provided for by you, our potential supporters.  The Company is receiving an honorarium from The Pillow, although it is an amount that is dwarfed by our expenses. 
That's one of the things that is so confounding about dance.  Even when one receives a prestigious engagement, it is rarely enough to cover expenses.  Dance is prohibitively expensive to produce.  It takes time for people to learn choreography, even at the highest professional level, as are the Company's dancers.  Time is expensive.  Dancers cost money and space costs money.  The Company is paying what it can from our general operating budget, but it is not enough.
A week out from the performance our costs continue to escalate.
Please read our most current funding update, under the Update tab, to understand how we are using the funds, and how additional funding will support the project.  This has been updated as of July 14.
Thanks for Your Help


Without raising this money, the Company will be uncomfortably in the red.  Our ongoing and upcoming programming will be dramatically impacted, restraining the projects we provide for the general community of New York City and beyond.  We donate performances and workshops regularly.  And similarly, we receive many donated services.  From the administrative to the legal to the technical to the artistic, we are consistently buoyed by the generous contributions of professionals with pro bono work.  As a 501 c 3 organization we are thankful to be the recipients of such generosity as we fulfill our mission of serving the public.
Yet the dancers always do, and must, get paid.  The Pillow project demands we put our best, calloused and supple!, feet forward.  We are pointing and flexing these feet as hard as we can.  The free programming we offer is our way of giving to the community and sharing our love for the art of dance.  Your giving is a way to keep us going, to keep this cycle of reprocity, and to foster the magic of creating, interpreting, and watching art.

The score of <i>The Tempest</i> will feature the incidental music survived from the period--songs such as ""Where the Bee Sucks"" and ""Full Fathom Five""-- as well as new compositions, the use of Renaissance instruments (the viola de gamba!), a man/musicbox/computer collaboration for an experimental twist and a chorus of angels.

What's more exciting than wrangling a clowder of feral felines? Or more energizing than inserting a tuning fork into a wall socket? Answer: A group of artists creating collaboratively.

Introducing 
Sogmush Collective!

 The Happenings at Sogmush River
Or How to Become Chic and Mysterious All at Once,

Our collaborative performance piece is a dance theater musical mystery, inspired by the works of Edward 
Gorey, that master of pithy rhyme and gothic imagery.
 Through movement, music and silent film we will explore notions 
of fame & infamy, love & obsession, discovery & wanderlust. 
In February we'll perform this newly developed piece at The Kumble 
Theater for the Performing Arts in downtown Brooklyn. 
It's our world premiere. We want you to be part of it!We need your support to make this performance fabulous.

What: Sogmush Collective's production of The Happenings at Sogmush River or How to Become Chic and Mysterious All at Once.

Who Are Sogmush Collective
Sogmush Collective is a group of artists committed to producing thought-provoking, socially conscious, performance-oriented
 works aimed at questioning the interstitialâ€”the 
places where the arts meet, the places where people meet, the places 
where ideas meet. Like other interstitial art, which falls between, not 
within, familiar boundaries of artistic genres, our performances aim to 
bring together artists of differing media, culture, race, thought and 
skill to explore the possibilities of the new art collaborative. Our 
artists hail from at least five different countries and bring various 
artistic traditions into the mix. Through the creative
 workshop and salon model we write, dance, play, develop and discover 
together, to learn more about our craft and to create innovative works 
for adventurous audiences.
Our Artists-in-Residence are performance artists, multi-media artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, directors, visual artists, costumers and theater artists who have come together with the common goal of creating collaborative works.
We've been meeting 3-4 times a week for the past few months, developing story lines, choreography, film and music. The video above will give you a taste of our quirky esthetic. If you're a Gorey fan you'll love this performance. 

Check us out at http://sogmush.com. And keep up with our Indiegogo updates as we highlight some of our Artists-in-Residence over the next few weeks.


What We Need & What You Get
We need your help to make this dream (nightmare, that is) a reality. Help us bring more of New York's vibrant theater scene to Brooklyn. 

The Kumble Theatre for the Performing Arts in downtwon Brooklyn has generously donated rehearsal and performance space to us. We're eternally grateful and honored, so we want to make this performance a go-to experience for local audiences. Although The Kumble is providing the space and loads of support, they can't fund our entire project.

All your contributions will go directly into the production--to pay for lighting, to build scenes and costumes, to edit film--and to allow our Sogmush Artists-in-Residence to continue creating together. You'll also help us to find a more permanent home for our collaborative workshops. Become a partner in our collective.

Our Artists-in-Residence have dedicated themselves heart and soul to making this collaborative a success.

All you have to do is choose your contribution level and you'll become part of our production team. And you'll have our deepest thanks and undead love.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important to HNDC because we are growing our aesthetic and growing as artists, in turn we are servants of the SF community and contributing to our societies' art and culture.  The role of artists at this time are not highly valued by our country but good art frames what is happening in the world and gives life context and meaning. This project in particular enlivens the audiences and is ultimately transformative.  The piece begins with a portrait of a numb community, blocked emotionally and physically, but through relationship and awakening of self, they change into dynamic healthy beings.  If the audience leaves the theater more aware of themself, their body, and develop even just a bit more sensitivity in how they navigate through life, this dance is a success. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We are asking help from our supporters - you, to help pay the dancers for their time in rehearsal and performance. Here is a mini breakdown of our budget, so you can see how your donation will support our work.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1 dancer performance pay - $50 (times that by 7 dancers and 4 performances = 1,400)</p>
<p>1 dancer monthly rehearsal stipend - $100 (time that by 7 dancers and 7 months = 4,900)</p>
<p>7 dancers costumes - $250</p>
<p>props - $160 (bubble machine, balloons, ironing board)</p>
<p>theater rental - $500<br/></p>
<p>performance documentation - $300</p>
<p>photography and postcard flyers - $225</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is a bare bones budget. We are asking for $3000 through indieagogo, to ensure we meet our online goal, but our actual goal for this project is $8,000. <u>For those of you who would like to donate a larger amount and have the contribution be tax-deductible (thank you!) please click this link right below and donate through our non-profit fiscal sponsor ""Dancers' Group"".</u></p>

Vertigo is the only student theatre organization on campus that produces entirely student-written work.ABOUT THE PLAY: ANIMAL STYLE is a student-written play on campus this year, giving voice to senior theater student Nick Day's beautiful story. ANIMAL STYLE is about a group of people at a crossroads, all equally ill-equipped to handle where they have found themselves and each other. The story starts as a family sits around a cheap motel room somewhere near San Luis Obispo, CA. The three individuals span three generations. One is there en route to a retirement home. Two (or maybe all three) would not be there, if given the choice. Two are there because they are trying to do the right thing. All three love each other, each in their own way. And the next 24 hours hold monumental events that will forever alter lives, and their relationships to each other. This is a play focused tightly on the intersection of four lives--and in that way, is focused tightly on us all. For the first time in Northwestern Student Theater, there will be engineers, film students, and animators as part of the play’s creative team. By having the back wall of the set be a screen on which we can project images, in conjunction with electronically produced soundscapes and expressionistic moving lights, we hope to do more than just bring the play’s characters to life. Theater affords young artists the rare opportunity to take risks, make bold choices, and let free their imaginations. Our goal is to give the audience an experience that pushes them to recognize aspects of themselves they often deny exist. We cannot reach this goal without your help. The production is entirely student produced and funded, independent of the University, so only with your financial support can we get this play successfully across the finish line.

<p>We're talking today about the world premiere production of the award-winning play ""The Gambler's Daughter"", written by my long-time friend Paul North. Ever since I first read this script back in 2006, I've been looking for the ideal place to stage the premiere... and I've found it at the Eclectic Company Theatre, of which I am proud to call myself a member, and we are scheduled to open on <strong>January 4th, 2013. </strong></p>
<p>""The Gambler's Daughter"" is, at its heart,a play about family -- the one we're born into and the one we choose to part of. I'm a big believer in the idea of a family and this play really shows how the bonds of family can be stretched and twisted into all kinds of shapes, but seldom do they break.</p>
<p>All the fundamentals for a great production are in place-- we've got a great professional design team set to go, we'll have a full cast in just a few weeks but all we're missing... is YOU.</p>
<h3>Why support live theatre?</h3>
<p>Live theatre doesn't happen in a vacuum. Admittedly, sometimes good theatre can be hard to find in the TV/Film production vortex of the universe, not to mention in a rough economy. But the performing arts in general -- and theatre in particular -- are a vital part of a society and it's up to all of us to give artists the ability to tell stories to the people at large -- to entertain, to educate, to inspire.</p>
<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>This particular project has set a goal of <strong>$2500</strong> because we need to ensure that this story can be told effectively. All funds raised here, whether we hit that goal or not, are going to the production itself. For example, to pay both our designers (who pour their creativity in the world they build) and our actors (who inhabit that world to tell the story). Also building the sets, assembling costumes &amp; props and even ensuring that we can publicize the play in order to fill the theatre with eager patrons.</p>
<p>But don't think you'll go home empty handed, no sirree! We've got a long list of perks available for our generous donors and patrons of the arts. If you just look over there to the right hand side of the screen, you'll see the various donation levels available to you all. Those amounts are guidelines, of course... any amount is welcome. If you can't afford anything right now, please share this campaign with your fellow arts lovers using the handy tools that this fantastic site provides and encourage them to consider giving.</p>
<h3>But Wait... There's More!</h3>
<p>Of course there is! For everyone involved, whether you live in Los Angeles or not, if we meet our fundraising goal in time, <strong>I, Brian E. Smith, Producer and Director of the ""Gambler's Daughter"" do hereby solemnly swear that I will (*deep breath*) have my head shaved. In front of the audience. On opening night. Seriously.</strong> But wait... there's still more! For those of you who don't live here, if we meet the goal, we'll film the shearing and put it up on the web for all to see.

<p>New Musical Theater of San Francisco has brought together an exciting team of artists. I'm an Emmy nominated composer and have composed several musical scores. <em>CHANCE</em> will be directed by Tony Award-winner Robert Kalfin, founder of the legendary Chelsea Theater Center. The jazz inspired score will be directed and played by San Francisco jazz artist Tammy Lynne Hall and sung by our stellar cast: Richard Hefner, Ken Lear, and internationally acclaimed female impersonator Randy Roberts. </p>
<p><em>CHANCE</em> is not only a great show, with loads of humor and a memorable jazz inspired score, but it's an important piece of art about a psychologist so traumatized in his youth by the AIDS crisis that he never allowed himself to love. </p>
<p>The recording will provide a permanent record of <em>CHANCE.  </em>The album will be used as an aid in future fundraising, and it will help to promote my work to a wider audience.<strong> PLUS, it's a way for our noted cast's fans, who are unable to fly to San Francisco, </strong><strong>to experience the songs.</strong></p>

<p>I need $3000 to record at the renowned Studio Trilogy in San Francisco. Fees include studio rental, sound engineer, musicians' fees, mailing and manufacturing costs.

<p>Our music director, Tammy L. Hall, has made numerous recording with high calibre artists. As she will be overseeing the recording, we are confident it will be of the utmost quality.  </p>

This campaign is the ONLY WAY to obtain CDs of CHANCE: a Musical Play about Love, Risk and Getting It Right, by Emmy-nominated composer Richard Isen (me) from the stage show directed by Tony Award-winner Robert Kalfin. (www.chancethemusical.com.)
This CD will NOT be released for sale to the general public. 


New Musical Theater of San Francisco has brought together an exciting team of artists. I'm an Emmy nominated composer and have composed several musical scores. CHANCE will be directed by Tony Award-winner Robert Kalfin, founder of the legendary Chelsea Theater Center. The jazz inspired score will be directed and played by San Francisco jazz artist Tammy Lynne Hall and sung by our stellar cast: Richard Hefner, Ken Lear, and internationally acclaimed female impersonator Randy Roberts. 
CHANCE is not only a great show, with loads of humor and a memorable jazz inspired score, but it's an important piece of art about a psychologist so traumatized in his youth by the AIDS crisis that he never allowed himself to love. 
The recording will provide a permanent record of CHANCE.  The album will be used as an aid in future fundraising, and it will help to promote my work to a wider audience. PLUS, it's a way for our noted cast's fans, who are unable to fly to San Francisco, to experience the songs.

What I Need & What You Get
I need $3000 to record at the renowned Studio Trilogy in San Francisco. Fees include studio rental, sound engineer, musicians' fees, mailing and manufacturing costs. To show my gratitude, I'm offering a wide range of gifts and goodies - from an mp3 IPod ready song  to a video-taped Thank You Song from the cast recorded at the studio. I am even offering my culinary skills.




The Impact of Your Gift                                         
Not only will the album be a record of a great score, it will showcase this particular group of singers and actors and is the best way to ensure a continued life for the show.  There's nothing better than a great recording to get the attention of producers, festivals, other theaters and grant making organizations.  
Our music director, Tammy L. Hall, has made numerous recording with high calibre artists. As she will be overseeing the recording, we are confident it will be of the utmost quality.

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The Readers’ Theatre of Ithaca has provided sustainable theater at its bare essence since 2010. Committed to the <em>public good</em>, we believe <em>good theater</em> inspires dialogue within the community. Such an important civic resource should be affordable to all.</p>
<div>To help sustain our commitment to maintain low ticket prices, we are embarking on a community fundraiser. This campaign will:</div>
<ul>
<li>Help pay the rent our new performance space, The Black Box Theatre at Lehman Alternative Community School, located at 111 Chestnut Street in Ithaca, NY.</li>
<li>Compensate the actors, directors, musicians, and, most importantly, artistic staff, who dedicate so much of their time to producing each season.</li>
</ul><p>Our goal is to ultimately raise <strong><em>$25,000</em></strong> annually. This year, we hope to reach <strong>$5,000</strong>. This sum will allow us to give back to those who give their time and energy to The Readers’ Theater.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leveraging Talent</em></strong></p>
<p>To better leverage talent, the campaign will allow us to add a <strong><em>Business Manager</em></strong> to our currently artistically-driven board. This new proposed position would help The Reader’s Theatre grow in important ways through increasing both financial and supporting sponsorship and supervising the internship program currently under development.</p>
<p><strong><em>Contribute to Growth</em></strong></p>
<p>Today, we are a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization; The Readers’ Theatre filed this paperwork in part to benefit its supporters. We believe patronizing the arts should be rewarded. Your <strong>tax-deductible</strong> contribution will make reaching our campaign goals possible. </p>
<p>With your help, The Readers’ Theatre will continue to work with Ithaca area actors, directors, composers, musicians, scholars, and speakers to deliver a unique performance experience.</p>

<p>My name is Ricarrdo Valentine; I am a free-lance artist living in Brooklyn, NY.  I am currently collaborating and dancing with Christal Brown/INspirit Dance Company, Dante Brown/Warehouse, Malcolm Low/FormalStructure, Paloma McGregor, and Edisa Weeks/Delirious Dance. On April 2, 2013, I was accepted into Bates Dance Festival for their professional training program held July 20- August 11, 2013 in Lewiston, Maine. As a work-study scholarship recipient, I was generously awarded <strong>$1,200.00</strong> towards my <strong>$2,600.00</strong> tuition. My remaining balance on my account is <strong>$1,400.00</strong> and this is where our collective efforts come into action. Being at Bates this summer is an important and beneficial opportunity for me to continue learning about dance in all areas through classes such as Modern III, Business in Dance, Spiraldynamik, and Hip Hop. Also, Bates offers a cooperative community filled with creative artists, which will in turn provide me with rejuvenation as an artist and enrichment in art.  Your generous contribution towards achieving my goal is greatly appreciated. I believe with your support I will be able to transform as not only as an artist, but as a person that is taking another step closer to achieving my goal of being a member of a dance company while maintaining my individualism as an artist.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support! :)</p>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>In order to achieve my goal, I need <strong>$1,400.00 </strong>for the remaining balance of my tuition for Bates Dance Festival. Bates Dance Festival tuition is due on <strong>May 28, 2013.</strong>  In return of your generosity, each person shall get a personal note sent to your home. Additional perks are available to larger contributions; these perks are displayed to the right.  If I am unable to achieve my financial goal, I will use the raised amount and continue to apply it towards my tuition.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>The impact of your contribution is encouraging me to take another significant step into my dance career. I have seen how going to a professional training program can help one artist achieve their goals. For example, in 2011, I was fortunate to have attended Earl Mosely Institute of the Arts in Kent, Connecticut on a partial scholarship. Shortly after completing the intensive, my first professional opportunity was with Christal Brown /INspirit Dance Company at the Guggenheim Museum Works &amp; Process. There I performed a piece about the life and legacy of Muhammad Ali (""The Opulence Of Integrity"").  This opportunity has open up the door to work with other notable choreographers in the dance field. Attending Bates this summer will continue to open possibilities to advance as a student, artist and choreographer. I believe that Bates will keep me on track of contributing to the world through dance. </p>

<br/><h3>About Kathak:</h3>
Kathak is derived from an ancient storytelling tradition in Northern India. (The root of Kathak, “katha”, means story.) Kathak narratives generally center on tales of Hindu Gods and Goddesses, their triumphs and defeats. Performers trained in this dance discipline work on mastering a variety of forms of physical action, including mime and facial movements.<br/><br/>Kathak dancers wear ankle-bells (ghungroos), that serve to accentuate the rhythmic aspects of the dance and allow complex footwork to be heard by the audience. Swift, yet graceful body movements and spins are popular Kathak movements. <br/><br/>Today, there are three main schools (gharanas) of Kathak - the Jaipur Gharana - the regional style emphasizing the technical mastery of pure dance, the Lucknow Gharana - emphasizing dramatic and sensuous expression and the Benares Gharana –which blends both the former styles in a unique way creating its own style.<br/><br/><a href=""www.nupuracademyla.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Find out more on our website!</a><br/><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <div style=""text-align: left;"">
<h3>Goal of the Festival:</h3>
<div>Guru Kanhaiya Lal Dance Festival is one-of-a-kind grand festival to happen in Los Angeles, and is completely devoted to showcasing the communications of the Kathak style of Indian Classical Dance. While the festival features the dance-drama “The Sword &amp; the Flute” and showcases masters of Kathak from India and San Francisco, it profoundly nurtures the soul, the mind, and the body, all through an awakening journey of self-realization and exposure to the deep roots of dance and movement.</div>

<div><p><span>Speaking on the initiative, Guru Prachi Dixit says, “Our goal is to spread awareness about Kathak while preserving one of India’s traditional dance forms. The freedom of movement that Kathak affords gives a certain degree of speed. Kathak’s chakkars or spins are very popular and fast paced and it is an aspect of the dance form that audiences love. My dream is for everyone to experience and enjoy our culture, and all flavors of Kathak in its authentic form"".</span></p></div>

We will also release a demo track from Fandom Hearts 2 to all backers only.We're Fandom Musicals, and we're looking to bring you 4 new and amazing musical theater shows, both live and online.At Fandom Musicals, we're a not for profit volunteer theatre group, performing all these shows because we love performing, and you love watching it. In the past year, we've been able to bring you three amazing shows, and now we invite you to help us bring you another four more to both a live stage,  and the whole world online.In June 2013, you helped us raise enough money to perform ""Fandom Hearts"", our parody musical of Kingdom Hearts, and since then, we've put every dollar we've made into our sketch show, ""Off The Top Of Our Heads"", which premiered last January, and our sci-fi spoof ""Star Explor”,which premiered at ConBravo! 2014. Now the time has come to do another season of shows, and we look to the support of our fans to make it happen.Here’s some details on our upcoming season:Frost Bite is our Canadian comedic take on a zombie pandemic, and the whole genre of horror. A rag tag group of Canadians must team up and fight their way through a zombie infested city to stop their invasion, and expose an evil plot. It's filled with parodies of your favorite zombie fandoms, and pokes fun at the stuff we love about horror movies.Animezing is an interactive comedy sketch show with sketches and songs based around everything in Anime culture from the cosplayers, to the conventions, the voice actors, and to the fans they have. It'll include interactive improv with the audience, and a bunch of original songs.The X Musical tells the story of your favorite gang of mutants coming together to stop a familiar magnetic villain. Just like Fandom Hearts wasn't just about Kingdom Hearts, The X Musical is all about the world of comics, super heroes, and the characters facing all the problems that come with that. It'll have a major cast and feature new original songs, and a bunch of special effects for you to sink your teeth (or adamantium claws) into.And finally, the show our fans have been waiting for since July 2013, is Fandom Hearts 2, the follow up to our first full length production. Continuing on the ending to the last show, our clown shoed hero and his anthropomorphic friends are facing a new group of 13 villains, with some help from other Disney heroes. It's going to be up to them to discover new things about themselves, and put a stop to the darkness for good. It features brand new songs, and the continuing story our fans have been waiting to see.Our main goal is $1,400 which will fund both our next full length shows, Frost Bite and The X Musical. The budgets for each are as follows:FROST BITE$600

$300 Soundtrack


$100 Props / Sets


$200 Costumes

The X Musical$800

$400 Soundtrack


$200 Props / Sets


$200 Costumes

Because we want to be able to bring you all these shows however, we've added 3 additional stretch goals to help push the additional content that we can create from them. Stretch Goal #1 is $1700 which will fund Frost Bite and The X Musical (as listed above) as well as recording the soundtrack for Animezing.Animezing
$300 Soundtrack
Stretch Goal #2 is $2100 which will fund Frost Bite, The X Musical, Animezing, (as listed above) and will give us the absolute BASIC budget we need for Fandom Hearts 2 as follows:Fandom Hearts 2 (Basic)

$300 Soundtrack


$100 Props / Sets / Costumes

But if we can make it to Stretch Goal #3 which is $2700, it will fund Frost Bite, The X Musical, Animezing, (as listed above) and let us produce the best possible version of Fandom Hearts 2 for stage and online, as follows:Fandom Hearts 2 (Full)

$500 Soundtrack


$250 Props / Sets


$250 Costumes

<p>So, this is an IndieGoGo campaign, eh? I know you're gonna get slammed with these, given that it's festival season, so I'll try and keep this as brief and entertaining as possible. I realize I'm already defeating the brevity by explaining how brief I will be with words that are already taking up space where vital information cou--</p>
<p>Let me start over.</p>
<p>Hi friends!</p>
<p>I'm Nat. You probably know me. I write and direct plays. I'm presenting one of my NEWEST plays this summer in the <a href=""http://fringenyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NY International Fringe Festival</a>!</p>
<p>You may remember I participated in FringeNYC last year with my noir/Dostoevsky ghost story <strong><em>The Eternal Husband</em></strong><em></em>, which was wonderfully received. This year, given the nature of the project, we here at Tin Drum Productions wanted to go a little more grassroots-y, and so we're asking you for your gracious help!</p>

Hi friends!
So, this is an IndieGoGo campaign, eh? I know you're gonna get slammed with these, given that it's festival season, so I'll try and keep this as brief and entertaining as possible. I realize I'm already defeating the brevity by explaining how brief I will be with words that are already taking up space where vital information cou--
Let me start over.
Hi friends!
I'm Nat. You probably know me. I write and direct plays. I'm presenting one of my NEWEST plays this summer in the NY International Fringe Festival!
You may remember I participated in FringeNYC last year with my noir/Dostoevsky ghost story The Eternal Husband, which was wonderfully received. This year, given the nature of the project, we here at Tin Drum Productions wanted to go a little more grassroots-y, and so we're asking you for your gracious help!


>TRACK TWO: ""Who Are You,"" The Who
Songs of Love: A Theatrical Mixtape is a really special, unique show. It combines two of my favorite things: ridiculously warped love stories and sweet, catchy folk songs.
Basically, you've seen me do full-lengths (sometimes very full), but here is a collection of some of my twisted li'l short plays, each one having to do with romantic love.
And did I mention each short play is complemented by an original song, performed live onstage by a very handsome singer-songwriter? It's a THEATRICAL MIXTAPE, my friends, and it's been lovingly put together for you, by me, just like one of those 90-minute cassettes you know you're still hanging onto.
Tracks include: genital warts, decapitation, pornography, bagel fucking, and, of course ... love.

Producing in the Fringe is not easy, Buddy Holly. That's the dumbest thing you've said since, ""Why shouldn't the Big Bopper get to bring his snow machine onboard?"" Here is just some of what we need to raise money for in order to produce this special Mixtape:

Believe me when I say this adds up somethin' fierce. And I am but an humble writer/director with three kids to feed (those kids are named ""Rent,"" ""SallieMae,"" and ""Verizon""). So, whatever you can give is HUUUUGELY appreciated.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Hugh and Larry. Two childhood friends that went to a party one time, and at that party, they had a really, really, really, good time. This party is known as a Decentralized Dance Party. As many of you have hopefully attended one of our ddp's or Tom &amp; Gary's, we know that you share the same excitement as us. We however have a slight problem. Throwing these parties has become rather financially straining thus we come to you, our beloved fellow partiers, for support and additional party awesomeness. So if you have faith in us and yourself to make this dream a reality, help us to help you party!! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>DDP has come to be three letters synonomous with an unreal time. Many attendees have left claiming it to be one of the best nights of their life. The angles and aspects that can arise from the use of a Decentralized Sound System are limitless. March 5th we intend to throw another awesome DDP at UVIC. In order for this event to unfold, we need to get more batteries and more boomboxes. This is where we need the help of a few generous believers of the Victoria DDP crew.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is what it boils down to. During the Halloween DDP we walked away with 50 less boomboxes (~$500). That brought the fleet below half of what we originally had. In the spirit of these parties being so popular we turn to you for help. We need $500 to purchase more batteries and more boomboxes to pump more party awesomeness as the crowd size for the March 5th DDP became larger than anticipated within 12 hours of posting the event. We kindly remind you this fundraiser does not include the thousands of dollars of our own money we have spent to acquire the fm transmitter, every stereo, and battery which has brought the party madness thus far. We are just two regular guys that can't keep fronting our own money, but we are however willing to do all the leg work for these massive street parties. We have had nothing but a great time throwing parties in Victoria, and hope we get the chance to continue. As for the size of Hugh and Larry's upcoming DDP, we leave it in your hands. This is an all or nothing funding system. If we do not reach our goal, your donations will be refunded and the partying will sadly not go on. Please consider the fact we are not asking for a lot. Any night at the bar or club doesn't compare to a small donation for an unreal time at a Decentralized Dance Party. Thank you to all for your support. Now, to the right you will see our party perks. They are open to interpretation and if you have anything you would like to see as a perk don't hesitate to contact us and we'll try to make it happen for you. Hugh and Larry want this to be a party by the people, for the people. Any input is greatly appreciated!

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We kindly ask that if you believe in making the ddp a part of your future entertainment, you help us get the word out on funding this party platoon of awesomeness. Facebook posts, telling friends, pooling funds for the higher end perks, or anything you can think of to get this party package bigger and bolder. Let's do this Victoria!</p>
