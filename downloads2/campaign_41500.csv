0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi, my name is Ruth Dent and I'm an artist inspired by music, literature and poetry.  </p>
<p>Virginia Woolf's debut novel, 'The Voyage Out' is a favourite.  </p>
<p>It's 100 years since it was first published in 1915 and I have created an image to capture the spirit of the book.  One afternoon, with two paintings in progress, I reached for a fresh canvas.  Choosing colours for sea, sky and earth, I worked quickly and almost in a dream, finishing with a light blue edge to hold the image - like text on a page.   </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442226620/vguyvwpbxextzlomcqv7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Digitally printed onto crepe satin silk, this is now the </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Voyage Out Centenary Scarf</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">; only 100 will be printed.</span></p>
<p>And Isabel and I would like to invite you to buy one of these scarves.</p>
<p>Isabel works with me, despite living far away ... in New Zealand.  She organises the blog posts on my website, helps manage my social media and marketing.  We regularly Skype to bounce ideas around and discuss plans and progress.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Already we've had three scarves pre-printed to see what it looks like, feel how it wears and be sure we've chosen the right silk.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442240643/v4u2gdpb8unvilgjf7fq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p>
</div>
<div>The scarves measure 136cm x 136cm, are digitally printed on luscious velvety crepe satin silk and made in England.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A few friends and collectors have had an advance peek at the scarf - some can't wait to own and wear it, whilst others are planning to hang it on the wall!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And we've used these scarves in the video and promotional photographs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So now we're ready to produce these <b>100 Voyage Out Centenary Scarves</b>, and that's why we're asking you to support this project, as the funds raised will pay our production costs. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And your reward for supporting us can include one of these limited edition scarves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we don't achieve full funding, we will still print the scarves that you have purchased, so you will still receive your scarf plus any other perks you have chosen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So ""what's so special?"" </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>""Apart from being Virginia Woolf's debut novel?"" </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Voyage Out is a fantastic read:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It follows Rachel Vinrace, as she leaves England on her father’s ship, The Euphrosyne, bound for South America.  She travels with her Aunt and Uncle and a collection of other passengers - including Clarissa Dalloway, for part of the sea journey.  Over the course of the voyage and subsequent stay amongst ex-pats in South America, Rachel’s views on life develop and she finds her own voice, emerging a 'free-spirit'.  Rachel’s lifelong love is music, and a recurring theme is that it “says everything”. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Virginia Woolf wrote of her intention when writing The Voyage Out:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">""What I wanted to do was to give the feeling of a vast tumult of life, as various &amp; disorderly as possible, which should be cut short for a moment by the death, &amp; go on again ...""</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<div>And because it was her first novel, it's centenary should be celebrated, and what better way that to be able to take a scarf on your travels that has been inspired by an imaginary voyage by one of the twentieth century's greatest novelists?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Now I'd like you to see that if I set out to do something, I keep going until the project is successfully completed.  So here are a couple of projects that I've been involved with since graduating in 2010 with a BA (Hons) in Printmaking (First) from UCA.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Art for Evensong</b><br/>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>Inspired by Choral Evensong at Rochester Cathedral, I created a visual journey of the service as a series of 16 prints in 2009.  In 2012 these were transformed into painted banners and displayed in Rochester Cathedral.  Subsequently I took the banners 'on-tour' and they were hung in St German, Isle of Man (2013), Worcester and Bradford (2014).  </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442241776/iwl95aik0pw4zpyngvbc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Travels with my scarf</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>A first experience of taking a painting and turning it into a silk scarf.  Travels with my scarf launched in 2014, with four scarves inspired by music and packed in bespoke, hand-printed packaging.  Collectors are encouraged to share their travels on our blog, where we take photographs and add a little text - maybe a story, quotation or link to historical event or a famous person.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is when Isabel and I started working together.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442242578/w5rokcxhu2e6ozv3kb4q.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Isabel with L'Hiver scarf.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And with the successful completion of the <b>Voyage Out Centenary Scarf</b> project, there will be another scarf to feature on the blog.  We do hope so!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>We've worked hard to minimise the risks - three scarves have been pre-printed and used to check quality and ascertain peoples' opinions.  We've used a manufacturer we've worked with before, and have pre-ordered a small number of scarves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The biggest risk lies in the timing ... there's a 6 week lead-time and we need to get our order in as soon as possible to guarantee delivery in time for Christmas.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So it's over to you - if you, like us, like Virginia Woolf's writing, and you like the <b>Voyage Out Centenary Scarf</b> and you want to have one, please rush to choose your perk and help us get to our funding target ..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>... the sooner we reach our target the sooner we can order those scarves!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And we promise to keep you updated with planned and actual delivery times.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i><b>Your support will help us as we build our brand of art inspired scarves and we'd really like you to be part of 'Travels with my scarf' ... who knows where we'll be going next?</b></i></div>
<div><i><b><br/></b></i></div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>We want to say a big ""Thanks for reading this far!""</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>And ""yes - you can help"".  Please share this campaign if you would like to see us succeed.  </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>We know you can't all buy a scarf so there are some lower cost perks here too.  </div>

<div>“The voyage had begun, and had begun happily with a soft blue sky, and a calm sea. The sense of untapped resources, things to say as yet unsaid, made the hour significant, so that in future years the entire journey perhaps would be represented by this one scene, with the sound of sirens hooting in the river the night before, somehow mixing in.” [1992:17]<br/>

<p>“Inextricably mixed in dreamy confusion, her mind seemed to enter into communion, to be delightfully expanded and combined with the spirit of the whitish boards on deck, with the spirit of Beethoven Op. 112*, even with the spirit of poor William Cowper there at Olney.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi, my name is Ruth Dent and I'm an artist inspired by music, literature and poetry.  
Virginia Woolf's debut novel, 'The Voyage Out' is a favourite.  
It's 100 years since it was first published in 1915 and I have created an image to capture the spirit of the book.  One afternoon, with two paintings in progress, I reached for a fresh canvas.  Choosing colours for sea, sky and earth, I worked quickly and almost in a dream, finishing with a light blue edge to hold the image - like text on a page.   


Digitally printed onto crepe satin silk, this is now the Voyage Out Centenary Scarf; only 100 will be printed.
And Isabel and I would like to invite you to buy one of these scarves.
Isabel works with me, despite living far away ... in New Zealand.  She organises the blog posts on my website, helps manage my social media and marketing.  We regularly Skype to bounce ideas around and discuss plans and progress.
   What We Need & What You Get
Already we've had three scarves pre-printed to see what it looks like, feel how it wears and be sure we've chosen the right silk.

  

The scarves measure 136cm x 136cm, are digitally printed on luscious velvety crepe satin silk and made in England.


A few friends and collectors have had an advance peek at the scarf - some can't wait to own and wear it, whilst others are planning to hang it on the wall!

And we've used these scarves in the video and promotional photographs.

So now we're ready to produce these 100 Voyage Out Centenary Scarves, and that's why we're asking you to support this project, as the funds raised will pay our production costs. 

And your reward for supporting us can include one of these limited edition scarves.

If we don't achieve full funding, we will still print the scarves that you have purchased, so you will still receive your scarf plus any other perks you have chosen.

    The Impact

So ""what's so special?"" 

""Apart from being Virginia Woolf's debut novel?"" 

The Voyage Out is a fantastic read:

It follows Rachel Vinrace, as she leaves England on her father’s ship, The Euphrosyne, bound for South America.  She travels with her Aunt and Uncle and a collection of other passengers - including Clarissa Dalloway, for part of the sea journey.  Over the course of the voyage and subsequent stay amongst ex-pats in South America, Rachel’s views on life develop and she finds her own voice, emerging a 'free-spirit'.  Rachel’s lifelong love is music, and a recurring theme is that it “says everything”. 

Virginia Woolf wrote of her intention when writing The Voyage Out:

""What I wanted to do was to give the feeling of a vast tumult of life, as various & disorderly as possible, which should be cut short for a moment by the death, & go on again ...""

And because it was her first novel, it's centenary should be celebrated, and what better way that to be able to take a scarf on your travels that has been inspired by an imaginary voyage by one of the twentieth century's greatest novelists?

Now I'd like you to see that if I set out to do something, I keep going until the project is successfully completed.  So here are a couple of projects that I've been involved with since graduating in 2010 with a BA (Hons) in Printmaking (First) from UCA.


Art for Evensong


Inspired by Choral Evensong at Rochester Cathedral, I created a visual journey of the service as a series of 16 prints in 2009.  In 2012 these were transformed into painted banners and displayed in Rochester Cathedral.  Subsequently I took the banners 'on-tour' and they were hung in St German, Isle of Man (2013), Worcester and Bradford (2014).  




Travels with my scarf

A first experience of taking a painting and turning it into a silk scarf.  Travels with my scarf launched in 2014, with four scarves inspired by music and packed in bespoke, hand-printed packaging.  Collectors are encouraged to share their travels on our blog, where we take photographs and add a little text - maybe a story, quotation or link to historical event or a famous person.  

This is when Isabel and I started working together.

Isabel with L'Hiver scarf.

And with the successful completion of the Voyage Out Centenary Scarf project, there will be another scarf to feature on the blog.  We do hope so!

    Risks & Challenges
We've worked hard to minimise the risks - three scarves have been pre-printed and used to check quality and ascertain peoples' opinions.  We've used a manufacturer we've worked with before, and have pre-ordered a small number of scarves.

The biggest risk lies in the timing ... there's a 6 week lead-time and we need to get our order in as soon as possible to guarantee delivery in time for Christmas.

So it's over to you - if you, like us, like Virginia Woolf's writing, and you like the Voyage Out Centenary Scarf and you want to have one, please rush to choose your perk and help us get to our funding target ..

... the sooner we reach our target the sooner we can order those scarves!

And we promise to keep you updated with planned and actual delivery times.

Your support will help us as we build our brand of art inspired scarves and we'd really like you to be part of 'Travels with my scarf' ... who knows where we'll be going next?
 
    Other Ways You Can Help
We want to say a big ""Thanks for reading this far!""

And ""yes - you can help"".  Please share this campaign if you would like to see us succeed.  

We know you can't all buy a scarf so there are some lower cost perks here too.  

To be the first to hear about Ruth's art and future events please signup to receive her monthly newsletter: http://www.ruthdent.com/subscribe/


And we promise never to share your email address with anyone.

Want to share an idea, or comment - please contact Ruth directly.


And finally ... images of the perks!


This is how your scarf will be packaged - in a hand printed folder complete with one story postcard, five picture postcards, tied with ribbon threaded through a numbered, signed label to guarantee authenticity.



The River, 40 x 40 cm, acrylic on canvas

“Sometimes the flats and churches and hotels of Westminster are like the outlines of Constantinople in a mist; sometimes the river is an opulent purple, sometimes mud-coloured, sometimes sparkling blue like the sea.” [1992:4]



A slight but perceptible wave, 40 x 40cm, acrylic on canvas

“A slight but perceptible wave seemed to roll beneath the floor; then it sank; then another came, more perceptible. Lights slid right across the uncurtained window. The ship gave a loud melancholy moan.” [1992:9]



The voyage had begun, 40 x 40cm, acrylic on canvas

“The voyage had begun, and had begun happily with a soft blue sky, and a calm sea. The sense of untapped resources, things to say as yet unsaid, made the hour significant, so that in future years the entire journey perhaps would be represented by this one scene, with the sound of sirens hooting in the river the night before, somehow mixing in.” [1992:17]



Like a ball of thistledown, 40 x 40cm, acrylic on canvas


“Inextricably mixed in dreamy confusion, her mind seemed to enter into communion, to be delightfully expanded and combined with the spirit of the whitish boards on deck, with the spirit of Beethoven Op. 112*, even with the spirit of poor William Cowper there at Olney. Like a ball of thistledown it kissed the sea, rose, kissed it again, and thus rising and kissing passed finally out of sight.” [1992:29]
*Beethoven Op. 112 – A calm and prosperous voyage



It happened at tea, 40 x 40cm, acrylic on canvas

“Quite suddenly the storm relaxed it’s grasp.  It happened at tea; the expected paroxysm of the blast gave out just as it reached its climax and dwindled away, and the ship instead of taking the usual plunge went steadily.  The monotonous order of plunging and rising, roaring and relaxing , was interfered with, and every one at table looked up and felt something loosen within them.”[1992:63]



They had dropped anchor, 40 x 40cm, acrylic on canvas

“They had dropped anchor in the mouth of the Tagus, and instead of cleaving new waves perpetually, the same waves kept returning and washing against the sides of the ship.” [1992:30]



Mrs Dalloway, 50 x 100cm, acrylic on canvas


“‘What I find so tiresome about the sea is that there are no flowers in it. Imagine fields of hollyhocks and violets in mid-ocean! How divine!'” Mrs Dalloway and her husband Richard, had joined the Euphrosyne for part of the voyage.
Later, Mrs Dalloway would get her own book.


The moon poured its light through the empty air, 100 x 50cm, oil and acrylic on canvas

Over the course of the sea journey and her stay in Santa Marina, the heroine, Rachel develops emotionally, mentally and socially, in the process emerging a ‘free-spirit’. She meets and becomes engaged to Terence, a would-be author, to whom, at the top of a cliff she states that “Music goes straight for things. It says all there is to say at once”. Then she catches a fever and dies.
Then “for two or three hours longer the moon poured its light through the empty air. Unbroken by clouds it fell straightly, and lay almost like a chill white frost over the sea and the earth.”
I imagined that the night sky would be a deep inky blue and the moon, shining over the sea contains colours associated with the land and Rachel’s thoughts as its light pours down.

The Problem



The fashion industry is the the world's second most polluting industry in the world.


97% of our clothing is made overseas - and mostly by women in poor countries, there is a lack of transparency of who and how our clothing is made.


Every year, 80 billion new pieces of clothing are consumed, and the ""old"" clothing is thrown out.


Many fabrics are synthetics and take years to decompose, leaving mounds of clothing in the landfill.





Making an impact and creating change…
The EPA states, that clothing recycling today has an equivalent impact of removing one million cars from the nation’s roads.





MamerSass created a textile recycling event called Project Clothing Revival, where local churches and schools partner with us to help divert clothing from entering the landfill, and in return, we donate funds to their causes.


Teaching children the art of fashion design and repurposing at our ""Sass Up Your Summer"" Fashion Design Summer Camp Series.


Wine & Design- a night where adults learn how to upcycle clothing and jewelry while enjoying a glass of a wine! Held at our shop on Chincoteague Island, women create unique art and fashion using recycled materials.






                                                                  

There is Power in What we Purchase



Consumers are a big part in changing the way clothing is made and sold.
By buying second-hand and repurposed products you lessen the demand for new manufacturing.
By shopping at MamerSass you give discarded garments a chance to live again as new creations.
We believe one person can spark change in the world, but together is where our true power lies.

<p></p>
<p>My name is Erica Rupp and I have been invited to present my very first fashion collection at Vancouver Fashion Week F/W 2016. I specialized in costume making during my studies at the Arts University Bournemouth, where I earned a BA(hons) Costume with Performance Design degree. Drawing inspiration from my history with fine arts and tattooing, I have a unique vision and apply my enthusiasm for music into my artwork and designs. My portfolio is online at <a href=""http://ericaannrupp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>ericaannrupp.com</span></a>. </p>
<p>Rhinestoned Warhol is so titled due to my experiences living in Nashville the past four months - I’ve always been most inspired by pop culture and Andy Warhol’s take on pop art, and I came to Nashville to complete an unpaid internship for Manuel Cuevas at Manuel Couture. I fell in love with Nashville immediately and intend to make a collection about all the things that make Music City so unique! I want to combine the Manuel and Warhol influences with the most unique products, people and places from, in and around Nashville. Included on the cover page is a photograph of the style of work I will be continuing with for this project. The fabric comprising the dress pictured is a design I drew with some of my favourite images of Lady Gaga, worn with a faux fur coat, glove and wallet, all of which I designed, pattern drafted or draped, and constructed. Below that is a simple dress with a Mars Attacks! design I drew based off of the film’s poster. Pictured underneath is a simple quick sketch for a western style t-shirt, with leather collar, faux closure and piping, hand sewn arrows and 2 separate custom designed fabrics for a local band, the Stephen Cochran Project; they do a lot of work for veterans, and I hope to highlight other bands and places that give back to the community.</p>

I am proposing for your business to get the opportunity to have fashion created with your logo and supplemental photographs of your location, product, etc., in an all over kaleidoscopic repeating pattern print in a bright and fresh way that will appeal to a broad audience! I have included facts and figures provided by Vancouver Fashion Week below and in the gallery about viewership and attendance of the event, which is the second largest fashion week in North America. This is a great way for both of us to get international brand recognition! I have also selected a young local to Nashville model, Evan Poirier, to walk in the show in the finale piece provided funding falls into place. I very much want to be able to establish myself as a Nashville designer, although I am still new in town, because I feel so at home here and would love to continue to get to know the city better as I grow right along with it! Help me help you let the world know that there is more to Music City than country music! Thank you for considering commitment as a sponsor of Strawberry Moon Cactus presents: Rhinestoned Warhol at Vancouver Fashion Week F/W 2016.<p></p>

I fell in love with Nashville immediately and intend to make a collection about all the things that make Music City so unique! I want to combine the Manuel and Warhol influences with the most unique products, people and places from, in and around Nashville. Included on the cover page is a photograph of the style of work I will be continuing with for this project. The fabric comprising the dress pictured is a design I drew with some of my favourite images of Lady Gaga, worn with a faux fur coat, glove and wallet, all of which I designed, pattern drafted or draped, and constructed. Below that is a simple dress with a Mars Attacks! design I drew based off of the film’s poster. Pictured underneath is a simple quick sketch for a western style t-shirt, with leather collar, faux closure and piping, hand sewn arrows and 2 separate custom designed fabrics for a local band, the Stephen Cochran Project; they do a lot of work for veterans, and I hope to highlight other bands and places that give back to the community.





I am proposing for your business to get the opportunity to have fashion created with your logo and supplemental photographs of your location, product, etc., in an all over kaleidoscopic repeating pattern print in a bright and fresh way that will appeal to a broad audience! I have included facts and figures provided by Vancouver Fashion Week below and in the gallery about viewership and attendance of the event, which is the second largest fashion week in North America. This is a great way for both of us to get international brand recognition! I have also selected a young local to Nashville model, Evan Poirier, to walk in the show in the finale piece provided funding falls into place. I very much want to be able to establish myself as a Nashville designer, although I am still new in town, because I feel so at home here and would love to continue to get to know the city better as I grow right along with it! Help me help you let the world know that there is more to Music City than country music! Thank you for considering commitment as a sponsor of Strawberry Moon Cactus presents: Rhinestoned Warhol at Vancouver Fashion Week F/W 2016.

<br/>
<ul>
<li>Can you remember all of your passwords, PINs and usernames?</li>
<li>Have you documented all of your household possessions for insurance replacement claims?</li>
<li>Do you have copies of all your family's important and personal documents? And are they stored in a safe place off-site?</li>
<li>Would your spouse know what the state of your financial affairs were?</li>
<li>Do you keep a daily journal that is locked and encrypted?</li>
<li>Would you like to leave instructions for your caregivers in the event you become incapacitated?</li>
<li>Can you leave personalized messages for your loved ones and others such that only they can access them?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Think about it:</h3>
<br/>
<p><b>If something sudden and unexpected were to happen right now, would you or your loved ones be able to walk away with instant mobile access to all the critical information needed to carry on?</b></p>
<p>iMemorized.com provides you with a secure locked and double-encrypted virtual vault where you can assemble and store all your family's critically important information and yet have it remotely accessible from anywhere on the planet. 
With the use of the iMemorized app, you'll have 24/7 secure mobile access to all your passwords, financial, travel, and identity documents on the fly.</p>
<p>You leave home every morning believing you'll be home at the end of the day to protect your family's affairs, but the unfortunate reality is this isn't always the case and sometimes the reality is there is no home to come back to.
The unexpected happens. Fires, floods, landslides and many other destructive things can happen to you or your home.</p>
<p>How do you recover destroyed information about your insurance, accounts, assets, and identity documents?</p>
<p>How do you catalogue valuables lost to an insurance provider?</p>
<p>How do you recover your most treasured memories such as photo albums and family videos?</p>

<p>Do you fully trust large corporate cloud-based services for storing your most important and sensitive personal information? Have you ever accidentally shared 
information with the wrong person? While these services may be convenient for storing low security documents and photos, what about copies of your Will? Or sensitive financial information? Or personal recordings for someone
special? With iMemorized, you can create secure, double-encrypted message capsules for specific individuals - parents, children, business partners - discretely passing on only the information you want that person to have,
especially in the event that something should happen to you. iMemorized is that second chance to leave important information behind.</p>

</table>
<br/>
<p>Message capsules you create are secured using two layers of encryption. The first layer is automatically applied to every file you upload to iMemorized. The second layer is added when you assign 
a message capsule to one of your contacts (a ""participant""). You'll be asked to supply security questions and answers to further safeguard your memory capsule. You should try to select questions that only the person you're leaving the message
capsule for would be able to answer. iMemorized uses your answers to these questions to generate an encryption key, which, by its nature, is specific to each of your message capsules. The contents of the message capsule are then encrypted using
this key. Since only you and your message capsule participant know the answers to the security questions, and the answers along with the encryption key itself are not saved anywhere on the iMemorized system, no one - not even iMemorized 
administrators - could unlock (decrypt) any of your memory capsules once assigned. So this means only you and your designated participant have the means to decrypt the files held in the message capsule. iMemorized cannot help you recover this information.</p>

<p>iMemorized uses two-factor authentication to protect the most secure areas of your account on the iMemorized Website. For example, whenever you try to access the highly secure vault area, you'll first be asked to supply a one-time 
password before being able to proceed. Using the iMemorized mobile app, you can quickly generate this code, then enter it into the Website. One-time passwords are only valid for 30 seconds - after that, a new code will be generated
and you'll have to enter that one instead. Two-factor authentication gets it name from combining something you have (your mobile device) with something you know (your password, answers to security questions, etc.)</p>

</div></div>","How Can I Prepare for the Unexpected?


Can you remember all of your passwords, PINs and usernames?
Have you documented all of your household possessions for insurance replacement claims?
Do you have copies of all your family's important and personal documents? And are they stored in a safe place off-site?
Would your spouse know what the state of your financial affairs were?
Do you keep a daily journal that is locked and encrypted?
Would you like to leave instructions for your caregivers in the event you become incapacitated?
Can you leave personalized messages for your loved ones and others such that only they can access them?


Think about it:

If something sudden and unexpected were to happen right now, would you or your loved ones be able to walk away with instant mobile access to all the critical information needed to carry on?
iMemorized.com provides you with a secure locked and double-encrypted virtual vault where you can assemble and store all your family's critically important information and yet have it remotely accessible from anywhere on the planet. 
With the use of the iMemorized app, you'll have 24/7 secure mobile access to all your passwords, financial, travel, and identity documents on the fly.
You leave home every morning believing you'll be home at the end of the day to protect your family's affairs, but the unfortunate reality is this isn't always the case and sometimes the reality is there is no home to come back to.
The unexpected happens. Fires, floods, landslides and many other destructive things can happen to you or your home.
How do you recover destroyed information about your insurance, accounts, assets, and identity documents?
How do you catalogue valuables lost to an insurance provider?
How do you recover your most treasured memories such as photo albums and family videos?


Access Important Information Remotely





Use the iMemorized mobile app to create and organize video and audio messages, photos, and notes. Securely transfer them to the iMemorized server at any time.
Store important account, asset, and identity document information. Keep a scanned copy of your passport and other important documents with you at all times - whether you're travelling, or as part of your emergency preparedness.


Leaving Memories for Loved Ones





Create personalized message capsules for all of the people you care about - your parents, your kids, your spouse, or your business partner. Add security to ensure only the person you intend is able to access the contents you've left for them.
No lawyer, accountant, doctor, administrator, family members, or anyone else needs to be involved in passing on important information from you to your contacts.



What's Included?











A Fully-featured Web Portal



















iOS App


Android App









 

NOTE: Your iMemorized subscription includes 1GB of secure storage, but you have the option of upgrading this amount any time.

 






Mobile App Features





Create images, videos, audio recordings, and notes










A daily journal feature for making personal notes or diarizing your life where no others can possibly have access





Generate one-time passwords to access the most secure areas of the iMemorized Web portal














Use the calendar to keep track of confidential appointments and chronologically track your week, month, or year with notes, photos, videos, or voice memos





Create delayed messages before heading out into risky areas or when your plans change and no one has been notified of your whereabouts












iMemorized Web Portal Features








Use the web portal to organize files sent securely from the iMemorized mobile app. This is the easiest way you will ever find to organize your life.





Create and manage information about Accounts (e.g., bank accounts), Assets (e.g., your house, car, or financial investments), and identity documents (e.g., your passport or birth certificate) 
				   with mobile access 24/7 on the fly. With iMemorized, you never forget!













Upload files from your computer to your iMemorized Inbox, or directly attach them to Account, Asset, or Identity Document records





Create and manage message capsules for loved ones and business partners












How Do I Leave Messages for Others?











1
Create new photos, notes, audio recordings, videos, and scanned documents using the mobile app or by uploading existing files from your computer.







2
Create a message capsule for someone important. Choose a capsule type: event-based capsule or time capsule. The type determines when your message capsule will be made available to your participant.


















3
Fill the message capsule with photos, notes, audio recordings, videos, scanned documents - anything you'd like to leave for your participant.







4
One of the following happens:

Time elapses on your time capsule
You pass away
You become severely incapacitated


















5
Your family and acquaintances search iMemorized to see if they are one of your participants. Normally you would tell them you are a member of iMemorized and they should check the site if something were to happen to you. 
				They join iMemorized entering their own identity information, then search for you by name and provide one of the following:


A valid death certificate number
Details of your incapacitation
An access code your participant received via email








6
Behind the scenes, contact information for any person claiming to be a participant of yours is compared against your list of participants. The death certificate number, incapacitation details, 
				or access code provided by this person is also verified at this time.















7
Once the person inquiring about you has been verified as a message capsule participant, they must then correctly answer all security questions you created to protect the message capsule as an additional safeguard.






8
That’s it! Your participant now has full access to the contents of the message capsule you’ve left for them.











What Makes iMemorized Different?








Protect yourself against the unexpected by storing all your important information in a virtual safety deposit box - whether or not you experience a sudden tragedy or disaster.
There really isn't another platform out there quite like iMemorized. You now have a way to leave behind secure personalized message capsules for the people you care about and can feel secure
				in the knowledge that no one else will ever have access to it.





iMemorized is a privately-hosted service on dedicated secure servers, meaning it does not use the cloud or any other shared resources.










Do you fully trust large corporate cloud-based services for storing your most important and sensitive personal information? Have you ever accidentally shared 
information with the wrong person? While these services may be convenient for storing low security documents and photos, what about copies of your Will? Or sensitive financial information? Or personal recordings for someone
special? With iMemorized, you can create secure, double-encrypted message capsules for specific individuals - parents, children, business partners - discretely passing on only the information you want that person to have,
especially in the event that something should happen to you. iMemorized is that second chance to leave important information behind.


Security Features








   Double Encryption





Message capsules you create are secured using two layers of encryption. The first layer is automatically applied to every file you upload to iMemorized. The second layer is added when you assign 
a message capsule to one of your contacts (a ""participant""). You'll be asked to supply security questions and answers to further safeguard your memory capsule. You should try to select questions that only the person you're leaving the message
capsule for would be able to answer. iMemorized uses your answers to these questions to generate an encryption key, which, by its nature, is specific to each of your message capsules. The contents of the message capsule are then encrypted using
this key. Since only you and your message capsule participant know the answers to the security questions, and the answers along with the encryption key itself are not saved anywhere on the iMemorized system, no one - not even iMemorized 
administrators - could unlock (decrypt) any of your memory capsules once assigned. So this means only you and your designated participant have the means to decrypt the files held in the message capsule. iMemorized cannot help you recover this information.








   One-time Passwords





iMemorized uses two-factor authentication to protect the most secure areas of your account on the iMemorized Website. For example, whenever you try to access the highly secure vault area, you'll first be asked to supply a one-time 
password before being able to proceed. Using the iMemorized mobile app, you can quickly generate this code, then enter it into the Website. One-time passwords are only valid for 30 seconds - after that, a new code will be generated
and you'll have to enter that one instead. Two-factor authentication gets it name from combining something you have (your mobile device) with something you know (your password, answers to security questions, etc.)

</div>We are WABELT Co. We love leather and great design. Early in 2015 devoted ourselves to create a minimalist wallet with top quality leather.

</div>","Lets be honest, slim wallets are out there in different shapes and designs. However, none of the ones on sale satisfy our taste for high quality leather while keeping a clever and eye catching design. That is why we came up with The Banker Wallet. With your help, we want to bring to the market the most stylish, elegant, sophisticated and minimalistic wallet that you have ever seen. Every true gentleman should have a Banker Wallet in his pocket. There are colors available for the ladies to!
Don´t miss out! Back us and soon you will answering the question ""Where did you get that wallet? I want one!""



Stop driving with that bulky wallet in your back pocket! Say no more to that uncomfortable position while sitting. Say good bye to that bulky wallet!







The Banker Wallet has the perfect design for your EDC (Everyday Carry)








Ultra slim minimalist design: Carry your wallet in your front pocket or even in your shirt pocket! Evolve from that bulky old wallet. Less bulk, a lot more style!
Cash pocket: Keeps your notes separated from your cards while making them easily accessible. And yes, you can carry cards here and other items. We don´t use magnetic closure. Putting magnets close to your cards (The ones with the magnetic band) can cause demagnetization resulting in ruined cards.  
Side Card Sleeve with pull-tab: Provides easy and super fast access to up to 6 cards.

Personalize your lining and leather color: A personal touch is always nice! You can choose your preferred pattern for your wallet lining. You want it to be as sexy in the inside as on the outside, don´t you? 

Cash Pocket in action


Cards Sleeve with pull-tab in action


So slim that you barely notice it in your front pocket




Unnoticeable even while sitting









We believe that you deserve a top quality product, a wallet you can feel proud to own. That is why we only use the best available materials for our backers. We use full grain leather in all our products. Our leather provides the finest grain, softness and long term durability.
Our wallets are made from the same leather used by luxury brands with a much lower price tag! 













We Believe in honest pricing! You don´t know us, we are not a worldwide famous brand (We expect to become one with your help) hence our prices are not intended to make us rich. We want to raise enough money to bring The Banker wallet to anyone with great taste in any location on the planet while helping us to grow our company and develop new high quality products. This is our first crowdfunding campaign and we expect to create a long term relationship with out backers, not just a single transaction!
















We are WABELT Co. We love leather and great design. Early in 2015 devoted ourselves to create a minimalist wallet with top quality leather. The ones out there in the market where ""ok"" but we wanted something better, something beautiful. We decided to find some inspiration and bring it to life and share it with you today.

In this research we learned that there are different kind of envelopes. One of them is called ""The Banker"". Our wallets are inspired by this simple yet elegant looking envelope design.

Each illumiwear Story Scarf™ truly provides a personal LED light experience. Whether reigniting the memories of your young sparkler lighting days at the amusement park while awaiting an American pride fireworks display; or replaying homecoming games over and over while wearing school pride colors; or rekindling those chilly memories in your snowsuit during the first blizzard.

<p>     We are a team made up of two hard-working individuals from the Bay Area in California, on a mission to do our best to stir the industry up. To show consumers that it doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg, or in this case, a wrist, to get a quality, well-made timepiece. A watch that outshines it's competitors, inside and out. A lot of companies will preach this, but do they practice it? </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473473502/lx6kbnk4e3ummmzuwq9p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><i>The Right Watch For The Right Price, No Compromises.</i></h3>
<p>     We all know everybody has different expectations of what they need and expect in a watch. This why we are offering two classes of watches. One with a <strong>Japanese Miyota Movement (Issue 01)</strong>, and one with a <strong>Swiss Ronda Movement (Issue 02)</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473473544/u177e9cxxanarhzy8ao0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>    This gives you a chance to pick your side and decide on what you would like and how much you would like to spend. Both Japanese and Swiss Movements are very reliable, some just prefer one over the other. If you would like a solid watch that can perform on par with a swiss movement watch but for a lower price, the<strong> Issue 01 (Japanese Movement)</strong> is the one for you. We consider it to be an introductory watch but there's nothing introductory about it. This is our standard piece. A very affordable timepiece that is made with the same quality materials as the <strong>Issue 02 (Swiss Movement). </strong></p>
<p><strong>     </strong>The Issue 02 does have its perks, consider it to be the luxury model. The Issue 02 is packed with a Swiss Ronda 763 Swiss Made Movement, Screwdown Back Case, Metal Rhombus Minute Markers and Accents, Inner Case Edge Engraving, comes in different color cases, along with the highly popular Stainless Steel Bands.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473473585/enrtybrlj4dcvhjlcr3r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>      If we had to compare the watches to each other. We would classify the Issue 01 as a Toyota and the Issue 02 as a Lexus. Both are very reliable and great, some just prefer to spend a little more money because of the additional options. But at the end of the day, they will both get you from point A to point B and will last as long as the other. </p>
<p>   <strong>  Another benefit of the Issue 01 is that they are currently in Production, which means you will receive them earlier than the Issue 02's which are in the prototype stage and pre-production.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473473619/lobzbkliigkpbvu5xtdi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>     Both Issue's are top notch quality, rigorously crafted timepieces, especially for the price point they come at. Our watches come loaded and lack nothing but a high price. It is very hard to find a watch with these components including sapphire crystal for $50. Other companies will sell their watches with the cheaper, more scratch prone mineral crystal for $100-$200+. Like we said, we are bringing the best watches for the price. It is also very rare to find a swiss movement watch with the added components for under $100. We are truly a brand for the People. All of our watches also come with interchangeable quick release straps/bands, making it easy to swap your favorite 22mm strap/band if you please. We are truly a brand for the People. </p>

<h3><i>Design: </i></h3>

To show consumers that it doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg, or in this case, a wrist, to get a quality, well-made timepiece. A watch that outshines it's competitors, inside and out. A lot of companies will preach this, but do they practice it? 


The Right Watch For The Right Price, No Compromises.
     We all know everybody has different expectations of what they need and expect in a watch. This why we are offering two classes of watches. One with a Japanese Miyota Movement (Issue 01), and one with a Swiss Ronda Movement (Issue 02). 

    This gives you a chance to pick your side and decide on what you would like and how much you would like to spend. Both Japanese and Swiss Movements are very reliable, some just prefer one over the other. If you would like a solid watch that can perform on par with a swiss movement watch but for a lower price, the Issue 01 (Japanese Movement) is the one for you. We consider it to be an introductory watch but there's nothing introductory about it. This is our standard piece. A very affordable timepiece that is made with the same quality materials as the Issue 02 (Swiss Movement). 
     The Issue 02 does have its perks, consider it to be the luxury model. The Issue 02 is packed with a Swiss Ronda 763 Swiss Made Movement, Screwdown Back Case, Metal Rhombus Minute Markers and Accents, Inner Case Edge Engraving, comes in different color cases, along with the highly popular Stainless Steel Bands.

      If we had to compare the watches to each other. We would classify the Issue 01 as a Toyota and the Issue 02 as a Lexus. Both are very reliable and great, some just prefer to spend a little more money because of the additional options. But at the end of the day, they will both get you from point A to point B and will last as long as the other. 
     Another benefit of the Issue 01 is that they are currently in Production, which means you will receive them earlier than the Issue 02's which are in the prototype stage and pre-production.

     Both Issue's are top notch quality, rigorously crafted timepieces, especially for the price point they come at. Our watches come loaded and lack nothing but a high price. It is very hard to find a watch with these components including sapphire crystal for $50. Other companies will sell their watches with the cheaper, more scratch prone mineral crystal for $100-$200+. Like we said, we are bringing the best watches for the price. It is also very rare to find a swiss movement watch with the added components for under $100. We are truly a brand for the People. All of our watches also come with interchangeable quick release straps/bands, making it easy to swap your favorite 22mm strap/band if you please. We are truly a brand for the People.

<h3>About INTRVL Watches</h3>
<p>In today's watch marketplace, there's many styles to choose from, with most ranging in price from $100 to $250+.  What's interesting about the large disparity in retail price tags, is the little variation in materials used in watches at both ends of the price spectrum.  For the most part, expensive watches compare almost exactly to those with more reasonable and affordable retail prices.  The real reasons for the price difference is known as the ""brand markup"", which is caused by 1) the watches being sold through a traditional retail channel or store, which inflicts additional costs on the consumer, or 2) the watch brand knows they can charge a 10X+ markup because they have a loyal following.</p>
<p>At INTRVL, we don't believe in either, because watch lovers shouldn't be taken advantage of. Everyone should have access to high-quality and fashionable watches, without breaking the bank.  That's why we started this company.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what goes into our watches:</p>

</div></div>","About INTRVL Watches
In today's watch marketplace, there's many styles to choose from, with most ranging in price from $100 to $250+.  What's interesting about the large disparity in retail price tags, is the little variation in materials used in watches at both ends of the price spectrum.  For the most part, expensive watches compare almost exactly to those with more reasonable and affordable retail prices.  The real reasons for the price difference is known as the ""brand markup"", which is caused by 1) the watches being sold through a traditional retail channel or store, which inflicts additional costs on the consumer, or 2) the watch brand knows they can charge a 10X+ markup because they have a loyal following.
At INTRVL, we don't believe in either, because watch lovers shouldn't be taken advantage of. Everyone should have access to high-quality and fashionable watches, without breaking the bank.  That's why we started this company.
Here's exactly what goes into our watches:






Compare the materials that go into a watch that costs over $200 and the materials that go into an INTRVL watch, and you won't notice any difference.  In fact sometimes, our quality is better...

Keeping our quality standards in line with some of the best watches on the market, we've created a line of stylish and awesome looking watches made for wear on any occasion.  We've been rocking them around ourselves, and are extremely excited to share them with you.






 

The INTRVL Collection
Our very first collection features six styles, with both stainless steel and genuine leather options.

With your support, we will have enough inventory to make the Austin start a journey that will reshape the market for messenger bags and backpacks.While we work under the principle that we want to help people to Dress for Success with a transformable bag that works well in any context of your life, over the years we have always been committed to also supporting those who have been less fortunate in life.So, as you choose one of the great rewards that we're offering you to make the Austin Convertible Bag yours, you'll also like to know that we will go on supporting those in our community that need help to have a happy and thriving journey in life.The Austin started with a simple idea on paper is now ready for production. This has involved patents, trademarks, learning to sew all types of materials, and so many other hurdles that have been part of the process, such as researching out materials, factories, and shipping partners. We have put in many years and passionate persistence in developing a completely new concept in carrying bags for your convenience.I have been a real estate developer and have always found ways to stay in front of suppliers. Mostly it takes a balance of friendship and being a squeaky wheel when there is a problem. We have spent countless hours searching for a reputable manufacturing facility and have found a group who understand that a ""small guy"" like us can, and does, become a large company. They appreciate our established partnership and are as committed as we are to bring you the finest quality in bag manufacturing along with our unique design.As with any other manufactured product, this is a complicated process with many people and materials that need to come together. A hurricane or other natural disaster can interrupt the free flow of materials. That's why we have worked to find a factory close to the supplies we need. By shortening the distance the different materials travel to our producer, we can better control the timing of production.",22.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nate Miller and I am the founder of of Harbinger Watches! I am a 21-year-old in Oregon who has had a deep interest and appreciation for watches and other time-pieces since I was little. I spent a year studying Physics at Oregon State University before leaving and continuing my education and transitioning my field-of-study to business at the local Community College since then. I have always been interested in what it might take to design and make a watch of my own and I want to also have others have a chance to experience the designs as well - so I have begun forming Harbinger Watches!</p>
<p>This campaign is for helping us begin the design and prototype stage of production so that we can prepare to start manufacturing and hopefully begin selling our pieces by Autumn of this year! I have always been enthralled by business and having a deep interest in watches, I want to combine these and create something unique for everyone to experience. Since I have officially started this endeavor, it has become my life. I am a dedicated person who is willing to do whatever may be needed to move forward and reach my dreams - I am hoping that you can help me achieve this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal to get things going is to reach funding of $10,000. This money would be used to start the design with an expert team - which would take about a month or two. Once this stage is complete, we would be using more of the funds for prototype creation and custom tool piece production - this is where most of the funds would go.</p>
<p>If we have anything left over from this point, it would go into starting production of our full order of units so that we can begin selling these to the public for everyone to enjoy their new high-quality watches of fantastic design.</p>
<p>With contributing to our goal, you would receive early updates as to where we are at with our designs, see our concepts, and, depending on the size of your contribution, receive your own prototype piece as they are produced! My wish is to keep transparency with my contributors so they can see where their contributions have gone and what they are getting to be a part of!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want this company to bring something new to the entire watch and one day, apparel industry. There has been a lot of talk of how the existing companies are holding onto the past and not working to be a part of a more diverse and inclusive world. In a world where fashionable products are becoming more and more of a luxury for few, we want to bring it back to the mass public. I want Harbinger Watches to lead the charge of inclusiveness and diversity and bring a refreshed view to the fashion industry where all the companies are not just offering the same looking products to the public. I am hoping that you can help me get us there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first thing that may have come to your mind after starting to see what this company is and who is leading it, is that I am 21. You may be wondering if it would be too risky to contribute to us because of this alone and my lack of worldly experience - and it would be fair of you to have these fears.</p>
<p>However, in my current job that I have had now - I have worked with international supply-chain and procurement services for products of all kinds for the United Nations, World Bank, and other organizations. This job has taught me so much about product research, sales, marketing and everything in between. I have been able to build my personal network that is capable of helping me build a foundation for this company to grow into something with true potential. And while I may not know everything that would be needed to be truly successful right now, I am a dedicated person who will go to the ends of the earth to learn what needs to be done to get to my goal and learn along the way.</p>
<p>My goal is to be fully transparent with my followers and contributors so they know that things are on the right path and are able to provide input if they feel things are going astray. Allow me to build trust with you so we can create something unique for everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that some may not be able to contribute funds to help us but may still want to do something to help us out - and that is totally okay too!!</p>
<p>Another way we would really appreciate your help is to share our Indiegogo campaign with people you know! There is also our Twitter page you can go and follow so you can see how things are going with us! Link will be provided or you can search for @Harbinger_Watch</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to see what will become an amazing company dedicated to bringing great products to the world! </p>

About a year and a half ago I gave a good friend of mine named Ryan a pair of Transitions Drivewear lenses by Younger Optics for his birthday. I mounted them in a generic plastic frame. He absolutely loved them! Being a bit of a car buff, he tested them extensively in his Nissan 350Z. A month later he called me and said ""these lenses are awesome, but the frame is kinda heavy. If we can make them lighter, we should sell them!"". So for the past year Ryan and I have been working hard to create a products that will appeal to the car enthusiast niche. Apex Visionwerks was formed! To support our new brand we put together a video crew, and started a Youtube Channel called AV Car Chronicles. We make videos about custom cars and their owners. Our Drivewear sunglasses are worn by us in the videos and are subtly marketed.</p><h3>Driver</h3><p>We are seeking funding for our premium pair of driving sunglasses we aptly call ""Driver"". Most off the shelf sunglasses have poor optics and are made for the masses (one size fits all). Driver will be custom tailored for each individual, just like prescription glasses, even if you don't have a correction. Customizations will include lens size/shape, pupillary distance/seg height, and a number of coatings, including anti reflective and mirror. These state-of-the-art sunglasses will feature Transitions® Drivewear™ that not only polarize, but also automatically adjust to the current lighting conditions (even behind the windshield).</p><h3>Our Impact</h3><p>This product is important because it brings the same kind of clarity and optical precision that prescription lens wearers enjoy, to the everyday non-prescription driver. Because we want to deliver the best vision possible, we also encourage drivers to get an eye exam. In addition to health related screenings, an eye exam allows drivers to implement even very slight corrections so that they can be at their best behind the wheel. It's our hope that your contribution will not only #improveyourdrive but will improve countless others safety as well.</p><h3>Funding </h3><p>We are seeking $30,000 to bring ""Driver"" to market. In order to get a good price on the frames we need to order 500 pair for $15,000 ($30 per). The custom 8 base Transitions® Drivewear™ lenses are the expensive part. However because we have our own optical lab we are able to produce the digitally surfaced lenses for about $120 per set. Our packaging cost $10 per, for a total of $160 our cost per unit. Our introductory price will be $350 plus shipping for single vision digitally surfaced wrap compensated lenses. </p><h3>What We Can Offer Now</h3><p>If you donate to our campaign you will be able to order ""Passenger"" (our full carbon fiber Transitions® Drivewear™ Sunglasses) for $250. Passenger looks similar to a Wayfarer style and only weighs 12.5 grams. If you buy Passenger now, you will be first in line for your own Driver, behind the pre-orders. If you're still not sure or would just like to support, you can purchase our $60 AV Bamboo or a $5 pair of eclipse glasses and we'll send you lots of information and stickers about our product and Youtube Channel.</p><h3>Contingency </h3><p>If for some reason we don't make our complete goal we'll still be much closer than we were before. Our main hurdle is the $15,000 for frames. We can purchase the lenses in smaller quantities because Driver is made to order.</p><h3>The Function</h3><p>These lenses really are spectacular behind the wheel! The color is important because the raised contrast gives near and distant objects sharp definition. From overcast to sunny these lenses allow for clearer traffic light, and hazard recognition. Brighter conditions cause the lenses to polarize and darken, even behind the windshield. The lightweight carbon fiber frame lets you wear them comfortably for extended periods.</p><h3>Who Has Them Now?</h3><p>We have had the Passenger out for a few weeks and have been having great success selling them at drift races and car shows. Drivers are amazed by how clear the lenses are and have even bought a pair on the spot. Barry Clap is a professional drift racer who liked them so much, he let us put our logo on his car. I always have a pair with me and I've sold several to Uber drivers too.</p><h3>Qualifications </h3><p>I have been an Optician for the past 5 years. In the past 4 years I have successfully completed orders for prescription sunglasses for another company and shipped them all over the world. I'm hoping to do the same for  Apex Visionwerks. </p><h3>Challenges </h3><p>One of the challenges of this project will be the measuring kit we will send in advance of the final product. We will need to put together several kits that we will send the customer after purchase. The kit will include three pair of finished frames with clear lenses. They will be small medium and large sizes. Using a mirror, the customer will pick the best fitting pair, and place cross-hair decals on the front of the lenses exactly in front of their pupils. Once the fitting crosses are in place the customer will then mark their center with the included marking pen. After that they will complete the measurement checklist and just send everything back to us in the included box. This process will be accompanied by how-to and troubleshooting videos. </p><p>These kits will be easy to assemble and thanks to our Youtube Channel, AV Car Chronicles, the how-to and instructional videos will be easy to make too!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>We really appreciate your consideration! If you can't donate or buy one of our products at this time, please use the indiegogo share tools.</p><p> </p></div>","Apex VisionwërksI'm an optician in Nashville.

<p>Hello everyone! My name is Kim ^-^ many of you probably know me from my Instagram page @Pixel_Face where I post about my enamel pins and other art projects I'm working on! If you are just meeting me, then hi! I'm a devoted geek and hopeless otaku! I love all things anime, video games, D&amp;D, you name it!</p>
<p>About a year ago I rediscovered my love of pin collecting and even started creating a few of my own! I absolutely love being able to display and wear my pins out and about and showing off my collection from all the amazing artists I've had the pleasure of meeting. </p>
<p>With this project I wanted to design a cute Ita bag, stylish enough for a night out, that would also be perfect for everyday use. </p>
<p>With all of your help, we can bring these bags to life! All my pin making and designing is a labor of love.

</div></div>","Hello everyone! My name is Kim ^-^ many of you probably know me from my Instagram page @Pixel_Face where I post about my enamel pins and other art projects I'm working on! If you are just meeting me, then hi! I'm a devoted geek and hopeless otaku! I love all things anime, video games, D&D, you name it!
About a year ago I rediscovered my love of pin collecting and even started creating a few of my own! I absolutely love being able to display and wear my pins out and about and showing off my collection from all the amazing artists I've had the pleasure of meeting. 
With this project I wanted to design a cute Ita bag, stylish enough for a night out, that would also be perfect for everyday use. 
With all of your help, we can bring these bags to life! All my pin making and designing is a labor of love. I do have a full time job aside from my small pin business, so these foxy bags can only be produced with your support and contribution. I can not thank every one enough for helping me fund this project!

Everything that my label, <strong>ALEXANDRA ZVI</strong>, makes is ethical and to the best of my abilities.</p><p>With over 20 years in the fashion industry, I founded <strong>ALEXANDRA ZVI</strong> in 2012. I had a simple vision to design womenswear with a mission to create a classic, fashion forward label that attracts customers seeking quality and timeless pieces. However, it wasn't until 2017 when I decided to take my label to the next level, after watching a video by STOP THE TRAFFIK on YouTube. It was about the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which produces most of the world's cotton knit fabrics. This is when I discovered that there are more than 300,000 young women trapped in the Sumangali labour scheme. I began to sob uncontrollably, as I learnt about girls as young as 11 being lured with the false promise of a lump sum payment, used as dowry. I was heartbroken to discover that the families, who are usually from poor and rural villages, agree to this believing that their daughter's virtue will be protected, but sadly they are at risk of being sexually abused and not being paid! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532077777/hjbxa1yt6eykjoz9a2o2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>HOW 'HUMAN TRAFFICKING' CHANGED MY MISSION</h3><p>Trafficking and the enslavement of women and children is a horrendous problem worldwide. In India, there are many ways that children and young women are caught by traffickers. A child may simply be snatched off the streets, pushed into a van and driven to a distant city where she is sold.</p><p>Out of a feeling of responsibility for the damage caused by the fashion industry (specifically fast fashion) to these people, I changed my core values instantly. I wanted to raise awareness of the crime of 'modern slavery', which has become a catch-all term to describe human trafficking, forced labour, debt bondage, sex trafficking, forced marriage and other slave-like exploitation.</p><p>With nearly 46 million people around the world living as slaves, forced to work<br/>in factories, mines and farms, sold for sex, trapped in debt bondage or born<br/>into servitude (according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by rights group<br/>Walk Free Foundation), I decided to build a fair and ethical culture in the fashion industry and make this social change through <strong>ALEXANDRA ZVI</strong>. It has become my life's purpose to find new ways to improve consumer’s response to ethical fashion, so my aesthetic shifted from costume to ‘wearable’ fashion just so I could manufacture ethically and make a difference.</p><p>Later, I partnered with J.D. Nelson, a creative marketing specialist, who also feels passionate about improving the lives of these people, and together we re-branded the entire label and launched the Fifth Avenue collection. Our focus was to build brand awareness to help the label grow, and support the cause of ethical fashion.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532078433/pjbqzoyu1yqkjzaqxbxy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>MY PERSONAL GOALS</h3><p>Today, my main objective is to attract fashion consumers to shop ethically at <strong>ALEXANDRA ZVI’s</strong> online store (<a href=""http://www.alexandrazvi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.AlexandraZvi.com</a>), with 10% of the profits donated to STOP THE TRAFFIK (<a href=""http://www.stopthetraffik.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stopthetraffik.com.au</a>), an organization whose mission is to prevent, disrupt and abolish human trafficking and modern slavery.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532081296/rvtv8mb9mwrffpuj7uak.png"" src=""""/></p><p>As a fashion designer, I'm committed to crafting timeless designs, but as a human rights advocate, I am devoted to show the world my compassion for those who make my beautiful clothes.

My calling is to stop the human trafficking and the modern slavery which still exist today in manufacturing clothing.</p><p>We are far from the day when a consumer can purchase an item of clothing with total confidence that it’s free of slavery from thread to store shelf. We are far from the systematic change needed to eliminate slavery, however there's been some increase in awareness, following the work of media outlets such as '<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/india-clothing-workers-slave-wages"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Guardian</a>'.</p><h3>NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2019</h3><p>In early 2018, <strong>ALEXANDRA ZVI’s</strong> new and improved Instagram profile was noticed by Planet Fashion TV, who later formally invited <strong>ALEXANDRA ZVI</strong> to show at their New York Fashion Week show in February 2019.

This may have even happened when factories have claimed to produce ""ethically"" but failed to do so. But I want to overcome these hurdles by choosing the right factory that abides fair trade practices, so I am currently discussing with STOP THE TRAFFIK to find suitable manufactures in India. Even if I have to physically visit these factories and meet the workers, I want to ensure that the people who are producing for <strong>ALEXANDRA ZVI</strong> are well rewarded and living a great life.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532436384/ntud7mt9vuo6xkwwoqvz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The statistics of trafficking are overwhelming.

When I first saw that peacock print with all its vibrant colours; I was instantly enticed to buy the whole lot. The vintage floral pattern just spoke to me. When I walked past the contrasting dotted print, I felt that same emotion… and together they created a symphony of colour and print.My designs developed a parallel relationship with these fabrics. I applied vintage details to create a fashion forward silhouette, which can be seen in this collection of timeless pieces.Further sourcing found the luscious satin silks, and the extravagant jade, green tartan, which was certain to grab the attention in the board room.Designing this collection was intrinsic to who I am! The tailored elegance and glamour of Lauren Bacall certainly influenced this collection. I hope when women wear ALEXANDRA ZVI, they will feel invincibly ready to be whoever they choose to be.This collection is chic and modern with a hint of 1940s sophistication.  It screams 'REGAL' and is compared to some top Australian brands such as Leona Edmiston, Kookai, Cue and Witchery.MY VISIONI have a passion for designing the most classic, comfortable clothing possible and delivering them with a modern twist. Everything that my label, ALEXANDRA ZVI, makes is ethical and to the best of my abilities.With over 20 years in the fashion industry, I founded ALEXANDRA ZVI in 2012. I had a simple vision to design womenswear with a mission to create a classic, fashion forward label that attracts customers seeking quality and timeless pieces. However, it wasn't until 2017 when I decided to take my label to the next level, after watching a video by STOP THE TRAFFIK on YouTube. It was about the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which produces most of the world's cotton knit fabrics. This is when I discovered that there are more than 300,000 young women trapped in the Sumangali labour scheme. I began to sob uncontrollably, as I learnt about girls as young as 11 being lured with the false promise of a lump sum payment, used as dowry. I was heartbroken to discover that the families, who are usually from poor and rural villages, agree to this believing that their daughter's virtue will be protected, but sadly they are at risk of being sexually abused and not being paid! HOW 'HUMAN TRAFFICKING' CHANGED MY MISSIONTrafficking and the enslavement of women and children is a horrendous problem worldwide. In India, there are many ways that children and young women are caught by traffickers. A child may simply be snatched off the streets, pushed into a van and driven to a distant city where she is sold.Out of a feeling of responsibility for the damage caused by the fashion industry (specifically fast fashion) to these people, I changed my core values instantly. I wanted to raise awareness of the crime of 'modern slavery', which has become a catch-all term to describe human trafficking, forced labour, debt bondage, sex trafficking, forced marriage and other slave-like exploitation.With nearly 46 million people around the world living as slaves, forced to workin factories, mines and farms, sold for sex, trapped in debt bondage or borninto servitude (according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by rights groupWalk Free Foundation), I decided to build a fair and ethical culture in the fashion industry and make this social change through ALEXANDRA ZVI. It has become my life's purpose to find new ways to improve consumer’s response to ethical fashion, so my aesthetic shifted from costume to ‘wearable’ fashion just so I could manufacture ethically and make a difference.Later, I partnered with J.D. Nelson, a creative marketing specialist, who also feels passionate about improving the lives of these people, and together we re-branded the entire label and launched the Fifth Avenue collection. Our focus was to build brand awareness to help the label grow, and support the cause of ethical fashion.MY PERSONAL GOALSToday, my main objective is to attract fashion consumers to shop ethically at ALEXANDRA ZVI’s online store (www.AlexandraZvi.com), with 10% of the profits donated to STOP THE TRAFFIK (www.stopthetraffik.com.au), an organization whose mission is to prevent, disrupt and abolish human trafficking and modern slavery.As a fashion designer, I'm committed to crafting timeless designs, but as a human rights advocate, I am devoted to show the world my compassion for those who make my beautiful clothes. It is my duty to speak up and encourage consumers to shop socially responsible and environmentally friendly styles, rather than fast and cheap fashion.Through my fashion label, I hope to make a difference within the fashion industry. My calling is to stop the human trafficking and the modern slavery which still exist today in manufacturing clothing.We are far from the day when a consumer can purchase an item of clothing with total confidence that it’s free of slavery from thread to store shelf. We are far from the systematic change needed to eliminate slavery, however there's been some increase in awareness, following the work of media outlets such as 'the Guardian'.NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2019In early 2018, ALEXANDRA ZVI’s new and improved Instagram profile was noticed by Planet Fashion TV, who later formally invited ALEXANDRA ZVI to show at their New York Fashion Week show in February 2019. With the label’s limited funds, it has been challenging to design and manufacture a new collection for New York Fashion Week.In 2012, the financial impact of New York's Fashion Week (held in February and September) was a net of approximately $466 million in direct visitor spending leading to a further $773 million in economic impact.With a dream to step onto such a prestigious international platform, I hope to use this opportunity to not only push the fashion label, but to also shine a light on human trafficking and the modern slavery. I hope that this crowdfunding campaign will contribute to manufacturing my next collection and my vision to make a significant impact within the fashion industry.WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GETSo to help us create and manufacture our next collection, we need finances for the manufacturing processes with an ethical manufacturing factory, which will enable us to have some stock for our online store and boutiques across the world.To produce this collection 100% ethically, we will need a minimum of $55,000. In addition, to produce our next collection in time for New York Fashion Week in February 2019, we will need a further $50,000+.In addition, the money raised will also contribute to the following ongoing costs:
Social Media Campaigns - including Instagram/Facebook advertising ($1,500+ per month)
Website re-build and maintenance of online store ($5,000+)
SEO ($600+ per month)
Photoshoots ($5,000+)
Marketing ($10,000+)
Other paid advertising campaigns to raise awareness about 'ethical fashion' ($2,000+)
Public Relations ($5,000+ per month)
Packaging and presentation ($1,500+)
NYFW including flights and accommodation ($15,000+)
Other business related costs including legal fees, copyrights and patents, administration, staff etc. ($10,000+)

By supporting ALEXANDRA ZVI, you are supporting an organisation and giving us the opportunity to free someone from exploitation. Our label will not only donate to STOP THE TRAFFIK, but we will support and employ those manufactures who source their labour ethically. This will also help ALEXANDRA ZVI lower our prices, so our collection becomes more affordable for women worldwide.If I don't reach my entire goal, I will try again. I will also look for investors to financially back me. I plan to pitch to department stores in UK, Australia and USA to stock my collection! This would be a huge achievement and I know whole-heartedly that this would make a significant difference and the beginning of social change.THE IMPACTThe textile and fashion industry plays a major role all over the world and is considered to be the second most polluting industry worldwide because it causes negative impacts on people.Your generous contribution would help me attract fashion consumers and encourage them to shop ethically at ALEXANDRA ZVI's online store with 10% of profits donated to STOP THE TRAFFIK (www.stopthetraffik.com.au). This would positively change and impact the fashion industry and would help build awareness about the crime of human trafficking.No matter where we live, this problem exists everywhere around the world. As compassionate human beings, we must stand together and advocate for those who are victims of modern slavery. It's our responsibility to change this current system and to make a positive impact on our world.Your contribution will help STOP THE TRAFFIK prevent, disrupt and abolish human trafficking and modern slavery.Join over 2,000,000 people who've taken action to fight against modern slavery. You can make a difference under 30 seconds.RISKS AND CHALLENGESThe risks and obstacles that I will face trying to make a difference could fill the full page. Since running a fashion business ""ethically"" can be an expensive business to run, this means that I will continue to struggle financially. Since I don't have millions of dollars to achieve this mission, I will face challenges with lack of resources to produce and to market the label so that it is an internationally recognized brand. Most likely, I will continue to struggle with attracting consumers who want to shop socially responsibly and who are aware of this global issue. This means that I will need to work even harder and be more creative than other designers just to design clothes that break the stigma around ""ethical"" fashion being 'unfashionable' and unappealing. Because the whole fashion industry is accused of paying low wages, it is challenging finding a reputable 'ethical' manufacturer who won't send me broke, but I am determined to find the perfect manufacturer for ALEXANDRA ZVI.Although there are methods such as codes of conduct and inspections in place; somehow fashion retailers have failed to pay a living wage to workers, have accepted child labour, have misused human rights and asserted minimum labour standards in the workplace. This may have even happened when factories have claimed to produce ""ethically"" but failed to do so. But I want to overcome these hurdles by choosing the right factory that abides fair trade practices, so I am currently discussing with STOP THE TRAFFIK to find suitable manufactures in India. Even if I have to physically visit these factories and meet the workers, I want to ensure that the people who are producing for ALEXANDRA ZVI are well rewarded and living a great life.The statistics of trafficking are overwhelming. According to www.worldschildren.org, estimates vary of the number of slaves in the world today. On the low end, the U.S. State Department estimates that as many as 27 million people are living in bondage, however the 2016 Global Slavery Index estimates that there are 46 million enslaved people worldwide with 40 percent being in India.Although I have some significant obstacles to get past, there is a bigger risk of saying and doing nothing!  This problem will not only continue to exist, but it may continue to grow.I want to be part of a fashion industry that has put humanity and profit on equal footing. I need to see humanity in the fashion industry, therefore, I plan to tackle one problem at a time - piece by piece. I'll continue to strategize, research and design, until my plan is fail-proof. Without a doubt, I will fail in many ways but I learn from my mistakes. I will pick myself up and try again! I will listen to feedback and tweak things until I get it right. In a nutshell, I will not stop until I make a difference.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPFirstly, I want to say thank you for reading this and giving me a moment of your time.I understand that not everyone can contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!If my message has struck a nerve with you, then I want to empower you to advocate for change, and equality. Together, we can make a difference to humanity, especially to the communities targeted for human trafficking,Please spread the word and tell a friend about it.Help me educate consumers and build awareness of the power of slow fashion and ethical fashion (such as Stella McCartney) which is increasing every day, even if it's happening slowly.Let's start the conversation! We need to make some noise!Use your voice in whichever way you want!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our Viking hybrid smartwatch has the chance to disrupt the wearable technology market in that it provides both value and quality. The smartwatch technology market is still in a late infancy stage so there will continue to be new players who have a competitive advantage to offer, but are not yet household names. We are offering a device that is able to perform the necessity, daily functions as well as serve as a fashionable timepiece.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The primary obstacle we have now are capital constraints. We want to provide the best quality possible, but at the same time, need to operate in a sustainable manner. Research and development requires a great amount of time and money and so this is a hurdle that requires us to scale in the marketplace. By producing units on a larger scale we will be able to reduce our manufacturing expenditures. Additionally, our sole venue of sales is online which allows us to operate on a much lower budget than most of the major outfits. By continuing to focus on business-to-customer sales we can maintain substantially lower fixed costs. </p>

Moonchild Yoga Wear is a one-woman owned company founded in Aarhus, Denmark. We are now taking a new step in our journey with the Lunar Luxe recycled leggings and you have a chance to be an important part of this! 

Designed with the softest recycled bluesign® certified fabric.
Moonchild's mission is to empower women and we work with charity organisations to give back to women who need it the most so they can learn to start their own business and take care of themselves and their family in a long-term and sustainable way.
By supporting our project you will help make this journey a reality and give us the opportunity to do good through our eco-friendly product and by supporting women for a better future.

This campaign is all about women supporting women! With your contribution you will get soft, recycled yoga wear that will make you feel great and you will help empower women all around the world.

What We Need & What You Get
So why should you get excited about this?

We are looking to raise €30.000 for this campaign so that we can develop and introduce a new and more sustainable material to the yoga wear industry.
We need enough pre-orders for us the reach the minimum order quantity at our manufacturing partners. If you help us fund our first production of the Lunar Luxe Recycled Leggings you will be the first to try this new generation of yoga wear.
We need you to help us empower women and produce yoga wear that can create good all around the world.
You will get exclusive first access to the new Lunar Luxe recycled leggings at an amazing rate.


The Impact

So why do we ask you to join us?

Moonchild is still a small start-up company with 1 full time employee (Me - Louise - founder & owner) and 3 student workers helping out part-time. To develop and start production of new styles we need support and this is where you play an important part.
We have a mission to develop more recycled and sustainable products in the future and we ask you for your help on this journey.
We don't see you as a customer but as a part of our community. We have developed an online community for women, passionate about yoga and would love to have you join us! You can find the MY Community on the Moonchild Yoga Wear website.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Krystal Alpha, I'm a native full-time mother of 2 and I love making my own skincare. I started formulating in my kitchen when I was in high school.</p>
<p>It's important for me to start this business because my children are watching me, and saying to them ""Don't let anything stand in the way of your dreams"" just isn't good enough for me, I need to show them.</p>
<p>Funding TRUtanicals allows me to fulfill my passion of providing the cosmetics industry with an exceptional brand who's high standards and reasonable prices are clearly missing from today's market. I'd love to be able to earn &amp; save every paycheck from a job independently, but with my young ones, it is simply not practical at the moment and I have put this dream aside long enough!</p>
<div><h3>What I Need &amp; Why</h3></div>
<p><strong>Your funding goes towards:</strong></p>
<p>-My eco-friendly glass bottles which are more costly than plastic (which I am against using <u>unless</u> I can source 100% post-consumer recycled &amp; BPA-free plastic for a reasonable price).</p>
<p>-My organic supplier. They are certified organic and impeccably tested for quality regularly. Having searched and found the best lab in the USA, I will not settle for anything less than their vast ingredient inventory and expertise hence their high quality reflecting in their prices.</p>
<p>-I plan to seek organic certification myself and apply for the EWG as soon as I am able to scale up and meet their strict requirements.</p>
<p>-The website host I plan to use has a 3 yr subscription plan I need to cut out the techy guess work so I can dedicate more time on other facets of my business.</p>
<p>-The labels I require must be waterproof and durable which cost more than paper labels.</p>
<p>-Fictitious business name registration, running the required  local newspaper ad, my city business license, and insurance.</p>
<p>-Equipment ranging from organization for various stages of production to lab equipment and a modest work station as well as the shipping fees for these large and heavy duty items.</p>
<p>-Shipping supplies (transporting liquid inside of glass requires a decent amount of padding).</p>
<p>-misc: security deposits for county, set-up/design fees for merchandise branding, additional costs such as shipping insurance, expedited shipping and taxes to all the above that add up.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a donor, you're doing way more than just throwing coins in my hat, as a businesswoman, I'm doing much more than just starting a beauty line. My ultimate goal is to facilitate the access of detox and rehabilitation clinics to addicts, specifically Native Americans who want to be freed of their addictions. There has been a silent and deadly epidemic tearing families apart across this country for centuries. I desperately need this business to succeed; lives depend on it. I am not seeking glamour or luxury, I simply want to cleanse bodies and mend families. Family is everything to me and my goals are achievable. </p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>Being a mother I naturally plan ahead for inevitable mishaps, accidents or delays on a daily basis. For this project, there aren't any challenges beside my lack of funds. Having an online store is not risky business. I'm playing it very safe by starting online now with pop-up shops and storefronts to come in the future when I am ready.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I have  raised only $235 in a span of 10 months from friends and family to produce a handful of product samples. I'm absolutely grateful for every dollar donated but it has come in too low and far too slow. So I challenge YOU to donate your current battery percentage AND share this campaign with 5 people using the Indiegogo sharing tools.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I'm dedicating this project and my mission to the memory of my outstanding uncle Caesar who took an oath to sobriety and appreciated beauty in all its forms. He passed the same day I launched this campaign. I'll make you proud, Uncle C.</i></p>

Being a mother I naturally plan ahead for inevitable mishaps, accidents or delays on a daily basis. For this project, there aren't any challenges beside my lack of funds. Having an online store is not risky business. I'm playing it very safe by starting online now with pop-up shops and storefronts to come in the future when I am ready.
Other Ways You Can Help
I have  raised only $235 in a span of 10 months from friends and family to produce a handful of product samples. I'm absolutely grateful for every dollar donated but it has come in too low and far too slow. So I challenge YOU to donate your current battery percentage AND share this campaign with 5 people using the Indiegogo sharing tools.
I'm dedicating this project and my mission to the memory of my outstanding uncle Caesar who took an oath to sobriety and appreciated beauty in all its forms. He passed the same day I launched this campaign. I'll make you proud, Uncle C.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Winifred Rose was started in 2016 and we are proud to say that we are half way through our fourth year of selling beautiful luxury clothing.</p>
<p>The impact that the fashion industry has on the environment has become more and more apparent over these four years, and we want to be part of the solution not the problem.</p>
<p>This is where you come in, we are looking for funding to produce our first ever sustainable collection.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise £10,000.</p>
<p>£5000 will be used to purchase fabric, the two fabrics we are using are recycled Econyl Lycra and sustainable silk. The garments will be produced in Europe at a small manufacturers who pay and treat their workers fairly, this will cost £4200. £800 will go towards the marketing and collection launch. If we do not reach our target of £10,000 the collection will still be made and released with lower stock availability.</p>
<p>This money will not only enable us to create this first sustainable collection, it will mean we can create eco-friendly clothing year after year, this is only the beginning, with your help we want to spread our message that eco is fun and bright and beautiful.</p>

<p>Lulu is pictured here wearing the Burning Man Silk Kimono and the Alana Recycled Lycra Swimming Costume both in Cheri Bomb print. We chose to use silk as it is one of the most sustainable fabrics on the market, and it feels super soft and luxurious against the skin, and looks beautiful. Here are some facts about silk production and its’s eco credentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silk is made from turning the fibres of the silk worm cocoon into thread.</li>
<li>The production of silk is one of the oldest known fabric manufacturing processes, producing very little carbon.</li>
<li>The Mulberry trees that the silk worms feed on actually suck in carbon from the air and produce oxygen.</li>
<li>The Mulberry tree requires little water and no pesticides or fertilisers to grow.</li>
<li>Silk is biodegradable and compostable.</li>
<li>The silk worm is eaten as a food source by the locals after their cocoons are used to produce the silk, insects are a high protein food source and produce very little methane which is harmful to the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here Lulu is wearing the Mila catsuit in Fern Gully print.</p>
<p>All our Lycra pieces are made of Econyl recycled Lycra, it’s made from reclaimed marine waste like old fishing nets and other plastic waste, they have a partnership with charity Healthy Seas who dredge the sea of this waste. The plastic is then melted down and spun into thread which is made into the fabric.</p>
<p>One of the best things about this process is that this Nylon thread has the potential to be recycled indefinitely, meaning old clothing can be returned and made back into virgin cloth to make new garments.</p>
<p>Using recycled Lycra is a no-brainer for us, it looks and feels like regular Lycra but by wearing it you are removing waste from the seas that needlessly damages marine life and the eco-system.</p>

<p>It is available in either Queen Bee as pictured or Cheri Bomb. These two prints were designed by Emotional Waterfall, an amazing artist who is local to Bristol where we design the collection.

<p>Winifred Rose was started in Bristol, UK, in 2016 by Rosie Toms, a British fashion designer.</p>
<p>Rosie studied fashion design in London before moving to Stockholm to design for high street clothing brand H&amp;M in 2012. After a few years getting to know the fashion industry in Sweden she moved back to London to work for indie brand Religion Clothing. These years of experience gave her invaluable skills and knowledge and in 2016 she decided to start her own label concentrating instead on slow fashion- well made, originally designed and socially conscious clothing, and Winifred Rose was born.</p>
<p>Creating limited collections of beautifully designed clothing, at Winifred Rose we originally focused on the festival fashion market, hand making sequin garments. Now we still make hand crafted sequin pieces that are made to treasure for years to come, but ultimately we want to pull away from sequins and focus on sustainable garments. This sustainable collection is the first of many to come and we hope to be a fully sustainable clothing brand in the near future.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>About us:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Yves-Noël Bangne. I am a trained Sport &amp; Event Manager and the creator of Noël Ban IVS. I created this business after completing my education, when I was going through a difficult time in my life. I chose to focus on creating something which could help others in the same position as myself, and other people around the world.</p>
<p><strong>OUR WORK:</strong></p>
<p>We are working in cooperation with businesses located in Europe as we want to focus on creating good workplaces for factory workers. We believe that people should be treated as people, and we therefore want to avoid working with certain factories which do not share our point of view. Our partner has a strong focus on sustainable materials and humane working conditions in line with human rights. Through these initiatives we can take into account social and ecological aspects, which helps to strengthen and maintain the planet as a viable place for future generations. This is our focus, as we want to influence our local environment by giving a helping hand to the organisations and projects that are trying to help vulnerable adults and especially children, who are our future.</p>
<p><strong>OUR VALUES</strong></p>
<p>Mission:</p>
<p>In the long term, By Noël Ban wants to inspire their consumers and communities to focus more on their immediate environment by engaging more in their local communities. We will work according to a socially responsible business model with people, the environment and the planet at the center. We will achieve this through collaboration with certified producers and local support projects that strive to make a difference for their local community<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Vision:</p>
<p>By Noël Ban’s vision is to make the Danish population take on greater social responsibility. Therefore, our desire is that the current generation of young people in our community works towards us all moving from giving responsibility to taking responsibility for the vulnerable members of our community. Our goal is to make social responsibility a lifestyle and not just a buzz word.</p>
<p>Values:</p>
<p>By Noël Ban wants to create a community around our brand and vision so that we can form a large family that has the same goal of expressing ourselves by striving to take care of our community. This is why we strive to deliver good quality organic clothing without compromising, and thereby achieving our goal of influencing society. This means that we in the company want to interact with our consumers via social media and create personal relationships. By Noël Ban is just a company that wants to make a difference in our community while providing quality organic clothing that is good for your health.</p>
<p><strong>Our donations:</strong></p>
<p>We want to have a donation feature on our webshop. This means that our customers, through a web shop purchase, will donate a percentage of the full amount to selected organizations. We want to emphasise that the customer will not pay extra, but that the percentage is taken from their purchase.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We therefore need 15.000 kr, which will be used for the registration of the company, production and shipping of the clothing.</p>
<p>Production: 5.000 kr.</p>
<p>Registration of the company to ApS: 40.000 kr., but we will start with 5000 and then work our way up.</p>
<p>Shipping, packaging and fee for indiegogo: 5.000 kr.</p>
<p>The Danish government has decided to abolish the corporate form of entrepreneurial companies. At the same time, the capital requirement for limited companies has been lowered to 40.000 kr. Therefore existing IVS (Entrepreneurial companies) need to register as ApS before the 15th of April 2021 or close down. If this happens, it will not be possible for BNB to fulfill our dreams.</p>

We're trying to make the UK's most sustainable facemask:

THREE layers of 100% ORGANIC cotton
NO microplastics. NO pesticides. NO waste.
Our packaging is made from fully recyclable paper
For every mask we sell, we plant a tree
Our masks are designed to stand for something



 
Who are we
Michael, our founder, has experience in the healthcare sector from being a medical student and working in a GP surgery. Michael understands the importance we hold as individuals to protect each other for society’s benefit through wearing facemasks.​


 
The story

Fed up with the lack of facemasks options that were sustainable, comfortable, affordable, and had three layers. Here at the #The.Breathe.Project we set out to change this. We don't just want to help you breathe safer but help the planet breathe easier with every purchase of our masks - through our use of sustainable materials and our mission to plant a tree with every mask bought.
By creating a sustainable business that can be scalable it allows us to produce a large enough volume of masks to supply cafes, chains etc that may instead buy  thousands of disposable masks or masks made from cotton/polyester that creates more waste in our communities.
With scientists at University College London estimating that if every person in the UK used one single-use mask each day for a year, an extra 66,000 tonnes of contaminated plastic waste would be created.

 

 
And fabrics made from polyester/recycled being the 3rd largest polluter of our oceans, - behind plastic bags and bottles.

 
The two most common materials currently used for facemasks are conventional cotton and polyester, and while they may be inexpensive to produce and offer some comfortability. They have MASSIVE environmental impacts attached to them. Don’t get your facemasks no matter how inexpensive. 
 
It costs OUR planet.
 
With the influx of so many masks into our lives. We’ve seen some inventive masks being developed. And while masks made from recycled ocean waste and plastic bottles may seem initially as materials that are good for the planet. In fact, when you wash your recycled polyester mask it will release thousands of microplastics to our waters that are extremely damaging not only to local ecosystems but eventually end up in our bodies also!!

 
Conventional cotton is a water INTENSIVE material requiring the use of gallons of water for a little amount of usable cotton. Opposed to organic cotton which uses nearly HALF the amount of water.

Even more, why the most practical ones are never fashionable and unique? Thanks to your help, we finally have the answer to our needs:Think about this bag (with details in golden or silvery, you choose!) as the perfect complement for any occasion:  1) You can wear it as a purse hanging from your shoulder for your daily routine.2) As a handbag from its rings for a more formal and sophisticated touch.3) Attached to your waist as a belt bag for those busy days you need to be hands-free.4) Or just take with you the wallet to that special date when you only need your essentials.   Chipolo is a bluetooth device with a FREE dedicated app connecting your laagam bag to your smartphone. You will always know where your bag is.  No more worries while carrying your bag!Our integrated power bank provides convenient energy to keep your electronic devices (smartphone, tablets, ebooks, GPS, etc.)  always charged. It comes with a cable adapter for Apple and Android devices. This external battery is ultra-compact (width: 0.5 inches/1.3 cm), has high-speed charging technology (recharge your phone in minutes) and comes with 10000m Ah of energy (enough to charge an iPhone 4 times).The Chipolo device and a the power bank are included with the purchase of our bag for free.

<h2><b>CONCEPT</b></h2>
<p>In Zurich lace bags are very popular, however we couldn’t find one that is big enough to carry a laptop and bear its weight at the same time. Lace bags that we own started to fall apart, especially at the bottom where the cotton is really exposed. Most of these bags also hang down too far on your back for our taste, that's why Sozius sits nicely in the center of your back, where it belongs.</p>
<p>Hence, we decided to create our own bag, which ended up as a more elegant approach on the classic one. The leather is not only making sure that the bottom of the bag doesn’t get damaged easily, but gives the whole bag a cleaner look and allowed us to create two nicely spaced pockets on each side of the bag.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242358/files/20150223083240-image-4.jpeg?1424709160"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In addition to these two pockets, we also made sure that the size of the bag can fit a vinyl record and that there’s a small keyring on the inside so you don’t have to dig for your keys at the bottom of the bag and so they won’t harm anything you carry in the side pockets.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242360/files/20150223083313-image-11.jpeg?1424709193"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

                        I play guitar every day. I love the blues and I love the feel of a handcrafted guitar in my hands. But I never liked the feel of the acetate or celluloid picks.

My nephew, Simen, hand carved two guitar picks of beech wood for me as a gift when he was twelve or so, six years ago. He even took the time to carve out my name, TH on one side and OR on the other. Those beech wood guitar picks changed the tone of my '91 Corona Fender Stratocaster and my Seagull acoustic.

                        In the following months I handcrafted a few wood picks for myself and noticed the distinct tone differences in woods, thickness and tips. I crafted over a hundred wood picks, playing them hard, giving them to guitarist friends, wanting feedback from working guitarists. The feedback turned out to be amazing, they all wanted to play with my wood picks. The wood picks rounded off the sound, created a warmer, smooth tone. This took away some mids, added base and shaved the highs.

                    I wondered if I could get a much brighter tone going in the other direction. I had tried playing with a coin and some primitive metal picks years ago and the thought manifested itself. Prototypes of wood/metal picks crafted, laminating a thin piece of metal between two pieces of wood, to see if a laminate pick can endure countless hours of constant beating onstage without breaking apart. The result was unreal! Experiencing fundamental tone changes in my guitars, NorwegianWoodPickers Custom Shop was conceived, high end guitar picks for professional guitarists.

                        Wood picks is, by far, not a new idea. What our research and prototypes developed into, is something we believe separates our picks from other brands. NorwegianWoodPickers wood/metal and wood guitar picks is a tone changing tool for professional guitarists. Handcrafted with care, enthusiasm and admiration for wood as the perfect material for crafting Fine Tiny Musical Instruments.

                        The one thing that separates great products from good products are often the attention to details and the no compromise attitude. There is a reason an expensive guitar do not come in a anonymous cardboard box. For a small company, like ours, it is essential not to take any shortcuts along the way, but to stay true to the initial challenge of creating a high end product with emphasis on product presentation.

                        We want to change the guitarists perception of the guitar pick, as mentioned, the most overlooked piece of gear in a guitarist rig. Guitarists use different guitars, strings, pedals and amps to get the tone desired. Playing a NorwegianWoodPickers pick for the first time is much like playing a new guitar. Experiment, try different combinations, adjust tone, find your <i>sweet spot</i>. It is important that you let your fingers get used to the thicker gauge and weight, specially if you play with wood/metal pick. Some players will adjust quicker than others, but the transition should become obvious after a little while. 
                    </p>
<p>
                        If our Custom Shop guitar picks drastically changes the sound of the guitar and opens it is tonality and maybe true potential, is it worth it? If we listen to all the guitarists we have met the past years, our customers and the artist we now endorse, it is worth it. We believe in them, they believe in us.</p>
<p>
                        Research indicates that there are about one million professional guitar players in the world, twenty million bedroom players and thirty million noodlers.                     
                    </p>
<p>
                        It has taken three years to get to the point where our product has reached the level of craftsmanship and precision desired. We are ready to expand production capabilities, both All Wood Series and Custom Shop and launch internationally. With your help we can make a tiny dent in the music instrument and accessories business which recently passed an annual sales of twenty billion dollars.

                        Since Notodden we have crafted guitar picks for norwegian guitarist and other foreign greats. I sat down with Tim Scott McConnell before a show. He tried many of my designs, he really noticed the difference in tone on his 12 string Taylor. We gave him a couple of Apple picks to take with, but we all know he is a fingerpicker.

                            Perks for our campaign are high end wood/metal and wood guitar picks. We chose Oak, Ash, Blood Beech and Kebony Maple. Gold, Silver, Copper and Brass. We selected round tip for our campaign, a tip we know works well
for most styles of playing. Blunt, Sharp and Carved edge will be available 
thru the Custom Shop in September. Please understand that no two pieces of wood are identical. Therefore, no two NorwegianWoodPickers wood picks will be exactly alike.

                     The fact that we collect and process our own wood gives us greater understanding of the material, it's qualities and esthetics. A deal with T.A.

This limited quantity woods is prepped and stored for use in the Custom Shop.

                    </p>
<p>
                    Kebony is a denser, heavier and harder wood than most trees found in Norway. The invention of the Kebonization process is a Norwegian story 20 years in the making. Kebony is a sustainable alternative to hardwoods from tropical regions. The processed maple resembles teak and other tropical varieties of wood.
                    </p>
<p>
                    Kebony Maple produces a brighter tone than Ash or Beech. It wears a little quicker, but for a bedroom guitar player these picks will last for months, for a professional guitarist they will last about 30-35 hours of rough playing.

                    Beech is the densest wood found in Norwegian woods. The difference between blood beech and regular beech is the wood and bark’s pinkish red colour. It’s a beautiful wood.
                    </p>
<p>
                    Blood beech produces a warm tone and wears slow. The density eliminates the feel of the strings hitting the pick between your fingertips.

<p>
                    It’s been said that an Oak tree grows for five hundred years, lives for five hundred years, and dies for five hundred years. Oak is a symbol of strength, life force and perseverance.
                    </p>
<p>
                    The keel of the Viking ship <i>Gokstad</i> excavated in Norway in 1880 was built of of a straight grown Oak approximately 25 meters (82 feet) in height. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber.
                    </p>
<p>
                    Oak is very bright in tone and feels superb between the finger due to the wood fiber structure. The wood ages beautifully.

                    The Louiville Sluggers are made from ash. Fender uses ash as guitar bodies. This is a long-fibered wood and we found out that the wear at the tip of the pick is minimal, hard playing actually packs the fibers at the tip before wear occurs.

                        NorwegianWoodPickers Naturally Curved Coconut Pick. This pick has been tested to stand a real stage beating. Paul Sherry, Grainne Duffy's guitarist, got a Myrthild 2.4 mm before a show at Notodden Blues Festival 2014 and played the whole festival with the pick and dug it. It had a slight curve perfect for his slim fingers. Paul Sherry is now an endorsed artist and we in the process of crafting a set for him.

                    Thor spent three years crafting prototypes and giving them to friends and other guitarist to try out. Their feedback and Thor's constant design tweaks and development of production methods have created enough momentum that we feel and believe is needed to run a successful Indiegogo campaign. We hope.

                    The level of craftsmanship is very high and no guitar pick leave the wood shop until they are crafted to specs. and meets Thor's insistent level of quality and accuracy.

                    NorwegianWoodPickers are constantly on the search for artists thru concert venues, festivals and social media. We reach out to musicians across the globe that inspire us, that has that certain energy, and let them try our picks. The decision to join our team is completely up to the artist.

<p>
                    Endorsement deals are initiated, now we need to work out the details with the individual artists. Delivery of the first picks, for testing, was at Notodden. This process is rather slow, but we want to be able to send them more picks to try, their feedback can assist us in creating even better picks.

                    Jimmy Henderson, guitarist for Dorothy Moore and Black Oak Arkansas, played the entire show at Notodden Blues Festival last year with a Oak pick I had given him the night before. It takes confidence to do that after playing fifty years with a plastic pick. Jimmy Henderson is now one of our endorsed guitarists.

                    We had a chance to meet Bill Wyman, Albert Lee and Terry Taylor backstage after Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings' show in Ål, Hallingdal some months ago. We had made a 5.0 mm Peroline Beech and a 2.5 mm Ågåt Apple pick for Wyman. He accepted though he told me he never plays with a pick, even on guitar writing songs. Still it was a thrill to meet such a historical figure.

<p>
                    Albert Lee and Terry Taylor both got a box with Myrthild Apple <i>split</i> picks. Albert Lee thought they would be good for acoustic. They both really liked the Silver Kebony and Copper Apple when we showed them what the Custom Shop can craft.

                    We collect logs, split, dry and cut them into boards, then down to 40 cm x 4 cm ready to be thickness sanded and made ready for the cnc router that we lease time on at Husemoens Gitarmakeri. We do not cut down trees to make guitar picks. We never will. We collect trees or parts of trees that professional tree choppers or others have chopped down or trees that have fallen due to wind and other freak of nature occurrences. A great deal of our very limited beautiful and unique woods is donated by private persons who want to contribute to NorwegianWoodPickers. We work hard to be accepted by The Rainforest Foundation or the Rainforest Alliance. 
                    </p>
<p>
                    We recycle what we can and strive to be a green business. The vintage cloth that comes with the tiny wood shipping crate is recycled from old canvas camping tents we collect from different sources, usually from private people. We boil the cloth and clean it so it is free from dust, sand and particles accumulated over time. Some of the tents we have collected are from the early 1970's and the worn, faded color is simply perfect. Some of the machines and tools we use are also vintage. They made great, solid machines back in the day and they still are. The prices are much lower and there are machine tools auctions and used markets for this purpose. 
                    </p>
<p>
                    We are in no way opposed to new technology, we just realize that many of the tools and machines we use are easily acquired used and does the job perfect.

                    With your support of our Indiegogo campaign we really hope to start production on a commercial scale. Should this be the case we will commit ourselves to keep crafting an excellent product at competitive prices. We have no idea what the response may be with this campaign. Maybe we will be back at the wood shop on monday or maybe we are on for an adventure. That is all up to you.</p>
<p>
                    All contributions, even if we never reach our goal of $5.000.- will be spent on the following areas:

<p>
                        Building a successful company in todays extremely competitive market is a great challenge in itself and having a great product alone is sometimes not enough. Creating a brand is even more challenging and more time consuming because you are looking for all the details that underlines the story and quality of the product. 
                    </p>
<p>
                        A graphic designer in the early stage of development was essential to create a solid framework around the product i.e. packaging, website and the story behind the concept. Graphic designer Pawel Bilas has worked with the project for almost three years, creating profile, types, website, prints and other marketing media. He also creates our presentation material and edits our films. Having a graphic designer with personal interests in the project is essential to create a tight visual brand identity. It is all in the details. 
                    </p>
<p>
                        The brand visibility thru Indiegogo, the supported websites and social platforms to promote the campaign is simply genius. We greatly appreciate that there is such a platform for small businesses to hopefully turn into bigger businesses, something that would have taken years to achieve back in the day. We have worked really hard to minimize risk, and overcome major challenges before launching this campaign.<br/><br/></p>
<p>
                        There are producers of wood picks on the market today that are brilliant at what they do and we admire their products. However, our research indicates that we are the only company in the world that produces this kind of wood/metal laminate pick. We have secured design protection with The Norwegian Patent Board. 
                    </p>
<p>
                    There is no doubt that NorwegianWoodPickers picks are some of the most expensive guitar picks on the market, with the price of raw materials, Norwegian taxes, labor cost and other expenses needed to run a business in Norway. There are high end acetate picks on the market today costing $35 and up and there are wood picks costing $4-5.- and up. We believe our product prices are not an issue at all. Picks are tools just like strings and there are guitarists changing strings on all guitars before every show. It is the preference of the guitarist.
If a guitar tech. orders a box of twelve Custom Shop picks for his boss for a tour, the tour coffee budget is still probably higher than the cost of the picks. It is a tool. It is an expense.

                    Norway, with little over 5 million people, has its limitations for such a product. Showing products and meeting distributors at NAMM and Frankfurt Musikkmesse is essential. We are competing with established brands and being a small business in Norway like we are, it is almost impossible to set aside budgets to attend these shows. With your contribution we will be able to travel and expose us to distributors in foreign markets and create awareness that there is a new unique, stellar product on the market eager to compete with high end music accessories manufactures.

                    Extensive testing of prototypes over the past three years working with guitarist has made us believe we are ready for the global market. However, some adjustments along the way will probably be necessary and are inevitable. This may result in delayed production or shipment in some instances. We will of course do our absolute best to ensure that does not happen. We have everything under control.

                        Yes. But this greatly depends on if you are a professional guitarist who gigs two hundred days of the year or a bedroom player or noodler.

                    Does wood/metal picks wear faster than acetate or celluloid picks? 
                    </p>
<p>
                        Yes and no. The wood wears down to the metal. From the moment it is played in it keeps the shape and the metal wears real slow.

                    Does the wood/metal picks and wood picks need to be played in?  
                    </p>
<p>
                        Yes. Your angle of attack and the way you hold the pick ultimately shapes the wood at the tip of the pick to your style of playing.

                    It just seems so expensive for a guitar pick?  
                    </p>
<p>
                        As mentioned in Risks &amp; Challenges, there are high end acetate and celluloid picks on the market today costing $35.- and up, and there are wood picks costing from $4—5.- and up. Product price is the result of effort, lubur, time and material. Norway is a fairly expensive country to establish a business in.

</div></div>","I play guitar every day. I love the blues and I love the feel of a handcrafted guitar in my hands. But I never liked the feel of the acetate or celluloid picks.
                       
                        
My nephew, Simen, hand carved two guitar picks of beech wood for me as a gift when he was twelve or so, six years ago. He even took the time to carve out my name, TH on one side and OR on the other. Those beech wood guitar picks changed the tone of my '91 Corona Fender Stratocaster and my Seagull acoustic.
                    


                        All Wood Series Oak.
                    

                        In the following months I handcrafted a few wood picks for myself and noticed the distinct tone differences in woods, thickness and tips. I crafted over a hundred wood picks, playing them hard, giving them to guitarist friends, wanting feedback from working guitarists. The feedback turned out to be amazing, they all wanted to play with my wood picks. The wood picks rounded off the sound, created a warmer, smooth tone. This took away some mids, added base and shaved the highs.
                       
                        
                            
                    I wondered if I could get a much brighter tone going in the other direction. I had tried playing with a coin and some primitive metal picks years ago and the thought manifested itself. Prototypes of wood/metal picks crafted, laminating a thin piece of metal between two pieces of wood, to see if a laminate pick can endure countless hours of constant beating onstage without breaking apart. The result was unreal! Experiencing fundamental tone changes in my guitars, NorwegianWoodPickers Custom Shop was conceived, high end guitar picks for professional guitarists.

                        Wood picks is, by far, not a new idea. What our research and prototypes developed into, is something we believe separates our picks from other brands. NorwegianWoodPickers wood/metal and wood guitar picks is a tone changing tool for professional guitarists. Handcrafted with care, enthusiasm and admiration for wood as the perfect material for crafting Fine Tiny Musical Instruments.

                    

                        Just like a guitar, someone actually cared for you to have your guitar. You can not build a guitar and not care. We care.

Creator & Owner





                        The one thing that separates great products from good products are often the attention to details and the no compromise attitude. There is a reason an expensive guitar do not come in a anonymous cardboard box. For a small company, like ours, it is essential not to take any shortcuts along the way, but to stay true to the initial challenge of creating a high end product with emphasis on product presentation.

                                Custom Shop Sønni Oak/Silver.
                    

                        We want to change the guitarists perception of the guitar pick, as mentioned, the most overlooked piece of gear in a guitarist rig. Guitarists use different guitars, strings, pedals and amps to get the tone desired. Playing a NorwegianWoodPickers pick for the first time is much like playing a new guitar. Experiment, try different combinations, adjust tone, find your sweet spot. It is important that you let your fingers get used to the thicker gauge and weight, specially if you play with wood/metal pick. Some players will adjust quicker than others, but the transition should become obvious after a little while. 
                    

                        If our Custom Shop guitar picks drastically changes the sound of the guitar and opens it is tonality and maybe true potential, is it worth it? If we listen to all the guitarists we have met the past years, our customers and the artist we now endorse, it is worth it. We believe in them, they believe in us.

                        Research indicates that there are about one million professional guitar players in the world, twenty million bedroom players and thirty million noodlers.                     
                    

                        It has taken three years to get to the point where our product has reached the level of craftsmanship and precision desired. We are ready to expand production capabilities, both All Wood Series and Custom Shop and launch internationally. With your help we can make a tiny dent in the music instrument and accessories business which recently passed an annual sales of twenty billion dollars.

                    NorwegianWoodPickers launched at Notodden Blues Festival 2014. The festival management let us introduce our picks backstage and we got an amazing response from artists like Keb' Mo', Paul Sherry, Davy Watson, Mike Anderson, Jimmy Henderson, Dave Fields, Marcus Løvdal and Bjørn Blix. 
                    


                        Jimmy Henderson plays a Myrthild Oak 1.8 mm pick at a show with Dorothy Moore at Notodden Church, August 2nd 2014. Melvin ""Housecat"" Hendrex on keyboard.
                    


                        Keb' Mo' and Thor backstage at Notodden. Keb' tried several picks and quickly found a favorite, Hedda Apple Copper.
                    

                        The guitarists at Notodden Blues Festival and other guitarists we have worked with since have really given this project a momentum forward.  
                    

                        Since Notodden we have crafted guitar picks for norwegian guitarist and other foreign greats. I sat down with Tim Scott McConnell before a show. He tried many of my designs, he really noticed the difference in tone on his 12 string Taylor. We gave him a couple of Apple picks to take with, but we all know he is a fingerpicker.
                    




                            Perks for our campaign are high end wood/metal and wood guitar picks. We chose Oak, Ash, Blood Beech and Kebony Maple. Gold, Silver, Copper and Brass. We selected round tip for our campaign, a tip we know works well
for most styles of playing. Blunt, Sharp and Carved edge will be available 
thru the Custom Shop in September. Please understand that no two pieces of wood are identical. Therefore, no two NorwegianWoodPickers wood picks will be exactly alike. 
                    


                                All Wood Seriers Ågåt Kebony, Oak, Ash and Blood Beech.
                    

                     The fact that we collect and process our own wood gives us greater understanding of the material, it's qualities and esthetics. A deal with T.A. Trefelling in Oslo, a tree-chop-down company, ensures a wide assortment and steady flow of woods. We also receive private donations of very limited beautiful and unique woods. This limited quantity woods is prepped and stored for use in the Custom Shop. 
                    


                    Nogusra, a company delivering gold and silver to Norwegian jewellers since 1936, will deliver the highest quality gold, silver, copper and brass for our picks.
                    







  
                    Kebony Maple
                    

                    Kebony is a denser, heavier and harder wood than most trees found in Norway. The invention of the Kebonization process is a Norwegian story 20 years in the making. Kebony is a sustainable alternative to hardwoods from tropical regions. The processed maple resembles teak and other tropical varieties of wood.
                    

                    Kebony Maple produces a brighter tone than Ash or Beech. It wears a little quicker, but for a bedroom guitar player these picks will last for months, for a professional guitarist they will last about 30-35 hours of rough playing.
                    











  
                    Blood Beech
                    

                    Beech is the densest wood found in Norwegian woods. The difference between blood beech and regular beech is the wood and bark’s pinkish red colour. It’s a beautiful wood.
                    

                    Blood beech produces a warm tone and wears slow. The density eliminates the feel of the strings hitting the pick between your fingertips.
                    











                     Oak
                    

                    It’s been said that an Oak tree grows for five hundred years, lives for five hundred years, and dies for five hundred years. Oak is a symbol of strength, life force and perseverance.
                    

                    The keel of the Viking ship Gokstad excavated in Norway in 1880 was built of of a straight grown Oak approximately 25 meters (82 feet) in height. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber.
                    

                    Oak is very bright in tone and feels superb between the finger due to the wood fiber structure. The wood ages beautifully.
                    











                     Ash
                    

                    The Louiville Sluggers are made from ash. Fender uses ash as guitar bodies. This is a long-fibered wood and we found out that the wear at the tip of the pick is minimal, hard playing actually packs the fibers at the tip before wear occurs.
                    

                    The tone is brighter than blood beech, but not as crisp as Kebony Maple.
                    












  
                    Myrthild
                    

                    25x30 mm
                    

                    Myrthild is as close to a classic 451 shape and size you can muster. She's a lady.
                        
                        
                        
                    











  
                    Milrid
                    

                    20x23 mm
                    

                    Milrid is a tiny version of Myrthild. She'sfor players with smaller hands, thinner fingers or just fans of tiny Jazz picks.
                    











  
                    Sollin
                    

                    26x30 mm
                    

                    Sollin is a large size Jazz pick. She's got similar feel as a classic 451 shape.
                    











  
                    Sønni
                    

                    22x26 mm

                    Ågåt
                    

                    26x29 mm
                    

                    Ågåt is the perfect medium size pick.She works great for most styles of playing.She's a real peach.
                    











  
                    Hedda 
                    

                    23x27 mm
                    

                    Hedda is a little narrower and a little rounder than Ågåt. But she's a fast little lady.

                    Olin is the tiny sibling to Hedda. She's great for intricate fast picking.
                    











  
                    Peroline

                   Custom Shop Series picks are shipped in a handcrafted tiny shipping crate based on 1970's real shipping crates. We just could not stand the thought of shipping our picks in a tiny plastic ziplock or any other plastic bag. The All Wood Series picks are shipped in small recycled envelope. Both seriers comes with specification tag.

                        NorwegianWoodPickers Naturally Curved Coconut Pick. This pick has been tested to stand a real stage beating. Paul Sherry, Grainne Duffy's guitarist, got a Myrthild 2.4 mm before a show at Notodden Blues Festival 2014 and played the whole festival with the pick and dug it. It had a slight curve perfect for his slim fingers. Paul Sherry is now an endorsed artist and we in the process of crafting a set for him. 
                    

                        On the drawing board the are new designs for thumb and finger picks as well as picks created specifically for acoustic guitars and ukulele. 
                    

                        NorwegianWoodPickers Wood Pick Care Kit is currently being developed. The kit contains vintage cloth, small container with bees wax and two 1.5"" x 1.5"" pieces of 400/600 sandpaper to even out damages from rough playing.

                    Thor spent three years crafting prototypes and giving them to friends and other guitarist to try out. Their feedback and Thor's constant design tweaks and development of production methods have created enough momentum that we feel and believe is needed to run a successful Indiegogo campaign. We hope. 
                    

                    The level of craftsmanship is very high and no guitar pick leave the wood shop until they are crafted to specs. and meets Thor's insistent level of quality and accuracy. 
                    


                    Morten is considered to be a craftsman. He was a wood shop teacher for 15 years before joining team. He has extensive knowledge about woods and has been part of developing wood production methods and planning a production line. 
                    

                    Early August every year Morten is a artist driver at Notodden Blues Festival and has been doing so for the past 21 years. His knowledge and direct connection to artist that has passed thru Notodden Blues Festival is extensive. 
                    


                    Pawel is consistent and persistent character. The attitude is if it can be tweaked it will be tweaked, which is rewarding for everyone involved. 
                    

                    Pawel's objective is a seamless visual expression that underlines the values of the brand and presents its vision in the desired and the understandable way possible, by the target audience.
                    




                    NorwegianWoodPickers are constantly on the search for artists thru concert venues, festivals and social media. We reach out to musicians across the globe that inspire us, that has that certain energy, and let them try our picks. The decision to join our team is completely up to the artist.  
                    

                    Endorsement deals are initiated, now we need to work out the details with the individual artists. Delivery of the first picks, for testing, was at Notodden. This process is rather slow, but we want to be able to send them more picks to try, their feedback can assist us in creating even better picks.
                    

“It changed the way I look at the guitar pick.”

                     — Ross MacKenzie
                    


                    Jimmy Henderson, guitarist for Dorothy Moore and Black Oak Arkansas, played the entire show at Notodden Blues Festival last year with a Oak pick I had given him the night before. It takes confidence to do that after playing fifty years with a plastic pick. Jimmy Henderson is now one of our endorsed guitarists.

                    

“The speed and accuracy of conventional picks — with the warmth and richness of fingertips! Still discovering subtle nuances.”

                     — Jimmy Henderson
                    


                    We had a chance to meet Bill Wyman, Albert Lee and Terry Taylor backstage after Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings' show in Ål, Hallingdal some months ago. We had made a 5.0 mm Peroline Beech and a 2.5 mm Ågåt Apple pick for Wyman. He accepted though he told me he never plays with a pick, even on guitar writing songs. Still it was a thrill to meet such a historical figure.

                    

                    Albert Lee and Terry Taylor both got a box with Myrthild Apple split picks. Albert Lee thought they would be good for acoustic. They both really liked the Silver Kebony and Copper Apple when we showed them what the Custom Shop can craft.
                    

                    Blue Mood Records signed artists, Marcus Løvdal and Bjørn Blix of Marcus Løvdal Band, recently became familiar with our picks and are now endorsed.
                    

“I’ll never play plastic again.”

                     — Max Mortensen
                    


                    We include bass players in our concept and as endorsed artists. This allows us to connect with an even greater audience. We recently added singer and songwriter Tor R. Seidemann Stavenes as endorsed artist.
                    




                    We collect logs, split, dry and cut them into boards, then down to 40 cm x 4 cm ready to be thickness sanded and made ready for the cnc router that we lease time on at Husemoens Gitarmakeri. We do not cut down trees to make guitar picks. We never will. We collect trees or parts of trees that professional tree choppers or others have chopped down or trees that have fallen due to wind and other freak of nature occurrences. A great deal of our very limited beautiful and unique woods is donated by private persons who want to contribute to NorwegianWoodPickers. We work hard to be accepted by The Rainforest Foundation or the Rainforest Alliance. 
                    

                    We recycle what we can and strive to be a green business. The vintage cloth that comes with the tiny wood shipping crate is recycled from old canvas camping tents we collect from different sources, usually from private people. We boil the cloth and clean it so it is free from dust, sand and particles accumulated over time. Some of the tents we have collected are from the early 1970's and the worn, faded color is simply perfect. Some of the machines and tools we use are also vintage. They made great, solid machines back in the day and they still are. The prices are much lower and there are machine tools auctions and used markets for this purpose. 
                    

                    We are in no way opposed to new technology, we just realize that many of the tools and machines we use are easily acquired used and does the job perfect. 
                    




                    For the early development stages NorwegianWoodPickers applied for a $20.000.- business start up grant from Innovation Norway and got approved July 17th. 2013. We developed designs, trademarks, business plans, budgets, collaborators, machine and raw material suppliers, relations with artists, goals and a tight vision.
                    




                    With your support of our Indiegogo campaign we really hope to start production on a commercial scale. Should this be the case we will commit ourselves to keep crafting an excellent product at competitive prices. We have no idea what the response may be with this campaign. Maybe we will be back at the wood shop on monday or maybe we are on for an adventure. That is all up to you.

                    All contributions, even if we never reach our goal of $5.000.- will be spent on the following areas: 
                    


                        Thickness sander. This is our main tool for consistency and accuracy prepping rods for production. 
                    

                        International marketing and social media outreach.

Raw materials such as gold, silver, copper, brass, aluminum and bone.


                        Packaging design, pick envelopes, pick specification tags, tiny wood shipping crates, vintage cloth and other underpinning material.  
                    


                    We believe that using Indiegogo will place us on the map worldwide and increase sales thru the web shop and greatly contribute to build our customer and fan base. With this campaign and your contribution we want to reach more guitar players and give them a chance to experience the nuances.





                        Building a successful company in todays extremely competitive market is a great challenge in itself and having a great product alone is sometimes not enough. Creating a brand is even more challenging and more time consuming because you are looking for all the details that underlines the story and quality of the product. 
                    

                        A graphic designer in the early stage of development was essential to create a solid framework around the product i.e. packaging, website and the story behind the concept. Graphic designer Pawel Bilas has worked with the project for almost three years, creating profile, types, website, prints and other marketing media. He also creates our presentation material and edits our films. Having a graphic designer with personal interests in the project is essential to create a tight visual brand identity. It is all in the details. 
                    

                        The brand visibility thru Indiegogo, the supported websites and social platforms to promote the campaign is simply genius. We greatly appreciate that there is such a platform for small businesses to hopefully turn into bigger businesses, something that would have taken years to achieve back in the day. We have worked really hard to minimize risk, and overcome major challenges before launching this campaign.

                        There are producers of wood picks on the market today that are brilliant at what they do and we admire their products. However, our research indicates that we are the only company in the world that produces this kind of wood/metal laminate pick. We have secured design protection with The Norwegian Patent Board. 
                    

                    There is no doubt that NorwegianWoodPickers picks are some of the most expensive guitar picks on the market, with the price of raw materials, Norwegian taxes, labor cost and other expenses needed to run a business in Norway. There are high end acetate picks on the market today costing $35 and up and there are wood picks costing $4-5.- and up. We believe our product prices are not an issue at all. Picks are tools just like strings and there are guitarists changing strings on all guitars before every show. It is the preference of the guitarist.
If a guitar tech. orders a box of twelve Custom Shop picks for his boss for a tour, the tour coffee budget is still probably higher than the cost of the picks. It is a tool. It is an expense. 
                    

“When you pay too much, you lose a little money — that is all. When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought is incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.”

                     — John Ruskin, British Writer and Social Critic                                   


                     
                    

                    Norway, with little over 5 million people, has its limitations for such a product. Showing products and meeting distributors at NAMM and Frankfurt Musikkmesse is essential. We are competing with established brands and being a small business in Norway like we are, it is almost impossible to set aside budgets to attend these shows. With your contribution we will be able to travel and expose us to distributors in foreign markets and create awareness that there is a new unique, stellar product on the market eager to compete with high end music accessories manufactures. 
                    


                    Extensive testing of prototypes over the past three years working with guitarist has made us believe we are ready for the global market. However, some adjustments along the way will probably be necessary and are inevitable. This may result in delayed production or shipment in some instances. We will of course do our absolute best to ensure that does not happen. We have everything under control. 
                    


                    We have decided to set up our Indiegogo campaign with the InDemand option, this will increase our global visibility and reach, and gives us the opportunity to continue our Picks for Perks and introduce new perks as we move forward. 
                    




                    Does wood guitar picks wear faster than acetate or celluloid picks?  
                    

                        Yes. But this greatly depends on if you are a professional guitarist who gigs two hundred days of the year or a bedroom player or noodler. 
                    

                    Does wood/metal picks wear faster than acetate or celluloid picks? 
                    

                        Yes and no. The wood wears down to the metal. From the moment it is played in it keeps the shape and the metal wears real slow.

                    

                    Does the wood/metal picks and wood picks need to be played in?  
                    

                        Yes. Your angle of attack and the way you hold the pick ultimately shapes the wood at the tip of the pick to your style of playing.

                    

                    It just seems so expensive for a guitar pick?  
                    

                        As mentioned in Risks & Challenges, there are high end acetate and celluloid picks on the market today costing $35.- and up, and there are wood picks costing from $4—5.- and up. Product price is the result of effort, lubur, time and material. Norway is a fairly expensive country to establish a business in.
                    




                    Even if you do not play guitar you can help us reach out and create awareness about our guitar picks. And if you do know someone who plays guitar, our Picks for Perks could be the perfect gift for a guitar player and maybe you can contribute to their never ending quest for tone.

                    We do not spam updates, but like to show some of our work and maybe share a link to an endorsed artist album release or concert. Our Instagram is our mood board where we try to capture images of wild nature and the old way of living in Norway. From time to time we will visit remote farms or peculiar places in search of woods or landscapes to photograph and would like to share this with you. This will give them a sense of where their picks are crafted and they can connect even further with the brand.


                    Please use the Indiegogo share tools, we know they would greatly appreciate that. 
                    

                     Thank you for viewing our campaign and considering contributing to NorwegianWoodPickers. We appreciate you sharing it with your friends and help us change the guitarists perception of the guitar pick.

<p>In 1973 I got my first after-school job. It was
with a corset specialist shop catering to women in non-standard sizes. Real
women.  I was 13 when introduced to lingerie and I never stopped loving
it. But life took me on another road into the corporate world and until now it
hasn't been possible for me to return to my first passion.</p>
<p>Now it is. </p>
<p>You can help me make a dream come through; a
dream of designing and producing handmade luxurious lingerie to modern women. </p><p><br/></p>
<h3>WHY?</h3>
<p>Life for the modern woman is hectic, high-tech
and standardized. Most of her wardrobe is produced on assembly lines on the
other side of the world, wrapped in plastic and shipped in containers. Her
lingerie strives to mold and form her body into a generic idea of beauty.</p>
<p>I want to honor the modern woman’s body exactly
as it is; with no restrictions, no metal wires, no padding. Just the feel of

<p></p></div>","MY (very brief) STORY
In 1973 I got my first after-school job. It was
with a corset specialist shop catering to women in non-standard sizes. Real
women.  I was 13 when introduced to lingerie and I never stopped loving
it. But life took me on another road into the corporate world and until now it
hasn't been possible for me to return to my first passion.
Now it is. 
You can help me make a dream come through; a
dream of designing and producing handmade luxurious lingerie to modern women. 
WHY?
Life for the modern woman is hectic, high-tech
and standardized. Most of her wardrobe is produced on assembly lines on the
other side of the world, wrapped in plastic and shipped in containers. Her
lingerie strives to mold and form her body into a generic idea of beauty.
I want to honor the modern woman’s body exactly
as it is; with no restrictions, no metal wires, no padding. Just the feel of
silk or cotton directly on the skin. I want to give her a feeling of stepping
back in time on this one point: her lingerie. Back to a time, where clothes
were made by selected silks, cut and sewn by hand, before carefully wrapped in
tissue paper. I want her to know that what she is wearing next to her skin,
has been made by somebody who cares.
WHAT I NEED
I am hoping to get sufficient funding to put two
initial collections into production, create a web page, design logo and company
profile and hire a part-timer for PR.  If I don't reach the full funding,
I will complete one collection and sell that on existing retail platforms. Iwill get started :-).
The budget for starting up is US$ 25.000 and
breaks down like this: If you're not able to help in a financial way, I hope you will let your friends know we are launching Haute Couture Lingerie. That would mean a lot to me. 





WHAT YOU GET
Aside from my gratitude, you will get a taste of Haute
Couture Lingerie. Depending on your contribution, you may receive a personal
letter, an ongoing account, a pair of silk briefs, or a set of silk lingerie or sleep wear. 

Please note that the photos are taken by me, just as I have sewn the models. These are just meant to give you an idea of the look and feel of the product.

<h1>The Macana Bag Is:</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<b>An Ancient Tradition</b>: The modern minimalist bag reveals a brightly colored handwoven lining when opened. This lining is an art form that dates back to the Incas. It is handwoven and naturally-dyed. This practice is at risk of being lost due to the modernization of the textiles industry.  </li>
<li>
<b>Socially Responsible:</b> The Macana Bag is designed to help preserve these artisinal traditions. In addition to purchasing the Macana material, a portion of the sales are re-invested into Jose and Anna's business to help them build a future.</li>
<li>
<b>Your Bag, Your Story:</b> Customize the bag to your needs and tastes by choosing from two sizes, three leather colors, and five Macana designs.</li>
<li>
<b>Designed to Work:</b> The design of the bag lives up to its story, with several unique and highly functional features.  </li>
<li>
<b>Guaranteed for Life:</b> It won't wear out, it will wear in. And in the rare occasion that something breaks, you can send it to us for repairs, for free, forever.</li>

<h1><b>An Ancient Tradition</b></h1>
<p>Outside of Cuenca, Ecuador, high in the Andes mountains, Jose and Anna Jimenez are working to keep an Incan tradition alive. They are weavers, primarily making a traditional shawl called the macana - a staple of the region's heritage. It’s handwoven using handmade looms, the dyes are made from rocks, plants and bugs harvested from their property, and the patterns are symbols of indigenous life in Ecuador.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Each strand of the macana is dyed in small bundles. Then they are arranged onto the loom to be woven by hand, creating the beautiful traditional patterns."" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/889/374/9cedb975dbcbd977188f4239a48cdfb3_large.png?1415684960"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Each strand of the macana is dyed in small bundles. Then they are arranged onto the loom to be woven by hand, creating the beautiful traditional patterns.</figcaption></figure><p></p>

<p>Thanks to a partnership with Pro Ecuador, an organization within the Ecuadorian Government, we've created a program that will let us mentor Jose and Anna on growing their business as we work together. This bag is the first step, and we're going re-invest a portion of the sales from each bag into the tools they need to grow. Tools like a car (they don't have one), a website, and improvements to their shops retail space. We launched this project on Kickstarter, and just hit our goal. We were hoping to make bigger investments in Jose and Anna's business so we're here on Indiegogo to make sure we can get Jose and Anna the resources they need to grow.</p>
<p><b>The Macana Interviews</b></p>
<p>On one of our planning visits to Jose and Anna's workshop, we documented the making of the macana on video and interviewed them. When we got back we had some friends interview us as well. We've put all that into a short documentary at the bottom of this page.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","The Macana Bag Is:


An Ancient Tradition: The modern minimalist bag reveals a brightly colored handwoven lining when opened. This lining is an art form that dates back to the Incas. It is handwoven and naturally-dyed. This practice is at risk of being lost due to the modernization of the textiles industry.  

Socially Responsible: The Macana Bag is designed to help preserve these artisinal traditions. In addition to purchasing the Macana material, a portion of the sales are re-invested into Jose and Anna's business to help them build a future.

Your Bag, Your Story: Customize the bag to your needs and tastes by choosing from two sizes, three leather colors, and five Macana designs.

Designed to Work: The design of the bag lives up to its story, with several unique and highly functional features.  

Guaranteed for Life: It won't wear out, it will wear in. And in the rare occasion that something breaks, you can send it to us for repairs, for free, forever.

As seen in:




An Ancient Tradition
Outside of Cuenca, Ecuador, high in the Andes mountains, Jose and Anna Jimenez are working to keep an Incan tradition alive. They are weavers, primarily making a traditional shawl called the macana - a staple of the region's heritage. It’s handwoven using handmade looms, the dyes are made from rocks, plants and bugs harvested from their property, and the patterns are symbols of indigenous life in Ecuador.

Each strand of the macana is dyed in small bundles. Then they are arranged onto the loom to be woven by hand, creating the beautiful traditional patterns.
But as Ecuador modernizes, fewer and fewer people are wearing this traditional garment. So in order to help Jose and Anna preserve their weaving traditions we’ve built the Macana bags around the fabric they use in their shawls.


Socially Responsible
Thanks to a partnership with Pro Ecuador, an organization within the Ecuadorian Government, we've created a program that will let us mentor Jose and Anna on growing their business as we work together. This bag is the first step, and we're going re-invest a portion of the sales from each bag into the tools they need to grow.

Jewelry became a passion of mine about 6 years ago, and led me to move to NYC and get a job in the jewelry industry.

Now I'm back in Michigan, living in Detroit and running my small jewelry business full time.

One of my favorite materials to work with is jewelers' brass, because it has the beautiful warm gold color that people love while still staying affordable.

<p>Hi Im Sylvia LLewelyn, but some people call me ' the Empress of Buttons'. That is because I have a wonderful small niche business that I have built up over the last 20 years selling Antique and Vintage buttons with an online store <a href=""http://www.oldbuttonsshop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.oldbuttonsshop.com</a> and also that I have made a unique  Collection of buttons (approx. 4,000) ranging from Roman Times to the Present Day. <br/></p>
<p>    From this Collection I published my book 'Old Buttons' five years ago with an Art Publishers here in Hungary, rather than a big International Publisher - it was their first book in their series in the English language and it has helped open up a new market for them and myself. The book is a lovely evergreen seller (Copies with a Price List of all 900 buttons pictured are one of my Perks) which has been sold at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum bookshop, London and last Spring at the Louvre's Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris when they did a major 2 floor exhibition of buttons. I have uploaded their video from last Spring because it will give you an idea of how interesting buttons can be for all people, from young to old, studying Decorative Arts, Fashion and the History of Mankind. In a way my Collection is even better as it is comparable in size and not just French buttons but examples are from All Over the World.    </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454624881/h9oe8jsfv4p9tdwjhlby.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 425.387px; height: 447px;""/></p>
Perk<b>. 'Old Buttons' book by Sylvia LLewelyn Published by Tandem Graphics Studio 2011</b><br/>Contains the History, Fashion and Collecting Information from Caveman to 1940's with 900 full colour photos of buttons in their actual size with a Ligne Guage for measuring buttons in the Fashion Trade.<br/>Now in Second Edition with Price List to help you discover if you have any valuable treasures in your Mother's, Grandmother's or Family Button Box.<br/><br/> About Myself and How I got into Buttons - I qualified as a Fine Art and Chattels Valuer / Appraiser in College and worked in the City of London valuing the Art and Antiques of the Rich and Famous for mainly Insurance purposes. I was brought up in the Antique trade as my Mother who had been a top Knitwear Fashion Designer in the 60's with Twiggy etc. later got into Antiques and we lived over the shop for many years in Cardiff. I took over the business when I was 20 and by the time I qualified as a Valuer at 30 and started out in London another Financial Recession hit and I was back working as a Sole Trader. After working at the famous street markets, like Covent Garden, Campden Passage, etc. I set up shop at the Antiques centre in the Kings Road ,Chelsea selling Costume jewellery and with the Fashion scene all around me and knowing from my background that Buttons to a Designer garment, can be as important as a Frame to a Painting,  I started selling buttons. I've never stopped trading and collecting them and I now have a stock of around 100,000 buttons (650 different styles online). I am passionate about my work and somehow I have had a living out of it (plus doing lots of other work, such as writing, teaching, interior design, acting, having paying guests to my Art studio/Button warehouse in Budapest.etc) except any spare money somehow gets ploughed back into the business and more Interesting Vintage and Antique buttons with the future dream of a Museum. So if I could only turn some of the buttons into money..(some of the gold ones are like Pirates gold treasure!! See the Perk below! And at the end of my story!) then the buttons would pay for the first stage of my plan for the Museum and pay for the building plot in the most perfect place for it.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454707420/vdngugsydpzk5wdbhkoo.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 378.667px; height: 284px;""/></p>

<p><b></b><br/>  Well life never always turns out like you plan and it certainly
 throws you a few curve balls. Mine was that I'm only child and my 
Mother was a Hungarian refugee from 1956 who was actually homesick all 
the time in the Cold War in Britain until my parents retired to Hungary in 1997. 
Sadly after 3 years Dad passed away so for the last 14 years I started 
living half the time in Budapest and half in London. Over that time I have seen many changes, learnt the language (somewhat!) and integrated into the wonderful cultural Budapest city life. Taste was very different and I couldn't sell my Vintage buttons here at first while a Vintage Fashion explosion was happening in London; the opposite was going on in Budapest; as everyone had put up with Secondhand and drab Hand-me downs through Communism so they wanted bright, shiny, new, Designer labels etc. but now that has changed and I have become well-known in the city, selling my buttons and book at the markets.<br/></p>

<p>What is difficult in Hungary although it has been part of the European Union for 20 years is that the wages for the People have just not gone up as in other Western countries. Id say an average wage for a Man with a Wife and family is around 500 $ or Euros a month. To integrate I had to take a 90% drop in the money I charged compared with London, say for my Interior design work or Art and Antiques valuation. Except somehow the Cost of Living is cheaper than other Western countries and you can mange quite well and have a good life. That is why so many artists, writers, and self employed Ex-pats live here. Of course Tourists love it as they feel like Kings or Queens with their spending power and there are so many Cultural things to do, like Opera, spa baths, architecture, restaurants, bars, all of which are very affordable. I have been having Guests from all over the World stay at my Button studio in the city for the last 4 years and they love it with my local cultural knowledge in the Art and Antiques scene - that's how Ive managed to pay the rent. So much that many return and are now venturing outside the capital.<br/></p>

<p><i>Size. Dia. </i><b>0.5 inch (12.7mm) L.20</b></p>
<p>I travelled all over Hungary and there are some beautiful places but one stuck out to me from all the others. I had heard of an old King's Hunting lodge and it is just on the edge of the city Public transport railway line. The Hunting lodge turned out to be a Classical Palladian house (similar to Chiswick House in London) on the riverbank of the Danube in a 500 year old settlement. It is a beautiful, picturesque and tranquil Heritage Village. It has a  church that has Hieronymus Bosch-like fresco work in bright colours that has never been restored, as good as any in Florence, Italy. The village has a Riverside market where twice a week, thousands of locals from the neighbouring villages and towns sell their produce (all organic) and crafted wares and there is also the thermal water there so there are 3 Four * Hotels and it has a few tiny museums (one is a Cowboy and Indian Museum!) and many Nature trails. Tourists have doubled from 20,000 to 40,000 per annum in this last year. I have become a frequent visitor there and surprisingly discovered that the property was not expensive..one because the Riverside Market is so good that the High St. remains empty of businesses unable to compete and there are no jobs for the locals other than traveling into the city (which is 50 minutes on the City Line and 20 minutes in a car). Although the Spa hotels are fully booked with tourists,,  other than the Market, there are no Art gallery shops or tourist craft shops. I know it is the best place for my Button business and Museum. It will put the place on the map and I will have a ready audience for my Buttons and Museum.<br/></p>
I<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454712676/tf8iyafdr7wpfxirnxa6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 346.5px; height: 462px;""/><br/>Perk 4. <b>Brass 4-Hole Buttons Set</b><i> contains 6 real brass metal buttons.These have had a patination on them so no need to polish them and will look great on coats, leathers and jackets.<br/><br/>Size Dia.</i><b> 1 inch (25.4mm) L.40</b><br/><i><br/></i>So for the last couple of years I have been studying everything about this Heritage Village and researching the property market. I have got my Hungarian papers (as I have Dual Nationality). I had seen a country shop with a 25 sq m wooden house for about that price of my savings and thought it would be a good place to start out and look for a premises once I was part of the Community. Anyway I was just about to try and buy it when it went off the market so I started hunting with other agents and then out of the blue found a property that had been reduced to half price because it had been empty for 4 years, right next to the 500 year old church, which is the best central location. So a real antique peasant house, in sound condition with good storage units for the buttons and with a very very big garden plot 600 sq m, enough to extend the existing 100sqm house or build another separate building such as my Button Museum. So I have half the Purchase money £11,000 of £22,000 and have to complete the purchase by the beginning of Spring but for a Single Woman like myself who has never had a regular income, only been in rentals, and is now not a Resident in the UK and neither has a work record income in Hungary..its going to be nigh impossible to borrow the money from a Bank. <br/><i><br/></i><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454713072/ihgdidea61fbqtaky0fb.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 351.628px; height: 320px;""/></p>
<br/>Perk 5. <b>Natural Real Silvery White Rainbow Mother-of-Pearl Shell Buttons Set</b><i> contains 6 quality Vintage Mother-of-Pearl buttons with beautiful rainbow colour highlights that you just don't get on Modern buttons but well matched for sets and with brass shanks. Suitable for any coat, jacket, etc.<br/>Size. Dia. </i><b>(just under and inch) 22.9mm L.36<i><br/><br/></i></b>So this is why I am asking if you will help Crowdfund this venture 
and purchase some of my beautiful buttons so that I can buy this plot 
with the house. Once this is done and if I am free of a loan I will be 
able restore this house within the year so I can have paying guests in the 
Summer while I make plans for a new structure or extension . I will work
 in the market to start with, make friends with the Community. Of course
 when the Museum is open it will be selling buttons in a shop section 
and therefor independently funding the running costs itself. When I am 
busy with the buttons then I always take on extra help. As with any 
business...we are never successful unless we can work with others. So 
even in my small business, there's been times when I have had six other 
people helping me with different jobs, such as the internet side of 
things, repairs, sales assistants, drivers, movers, collating and 
counting the buttons, packing orders, etc. Often in the past I have had many
women stuck at home for one reason or another, sewing the buttons on 
cards for me to earn a little extra money money and feel some self respect in their situations, The work is therapeutic and very satisfying. There is always work
 washing, sorting sewing the buttons as they are all recycled or old

</div><br/></div>","Hi Im Sylvia LLewelyn, but some people call me ' the Empress of Buttons'. That is because I have a wonderful small niche business that I have built up over the last 20 years selling Antique and Vintage buttons with an online store www.oldbuttonsshop.com and also that I have made a unique  Collection of buttons (approx. 4,000) ranging from Roman Times to the Present Day. 
    From this Collection I published my book 'Old Buttons' five years ago with an Art Publishers here in Hungary, rather than a big International Publisher - it was their first book in their series in the English language and it has helped open up a new market for them and myself. The book is a lovely evergreen seller (Copies with a Price List of all 900 buttons pictured are one of my Perks) which has been sold at the Victoria & Albert Museum bookshop, London and last Spring at the Louvre's Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris when they did a major 2 floor exhibition of buttons. I have uploaded their video from last Spring because it will give you an idea of how interesting buttons can be for all people, from young to old, studying Decorative Arts, Fashion and the History of Mankind. In a way my Collection is even better as it is comparable in size and not just French buttons but examples are from All Over the World.    

Perk. 'Old Buttons' book by Sylvia LLewelyn Published by Tandem Graphics Studio 2011Contains the History, Fashion and Collecting Information from Caveman to 1940's with 900 full colour photos of buttons in their actual size with a Ligne Guage for measuring buttons in the Fashion Trade.Now in Second Edition with Price List to help you discover if you have any valuable treasures in your Mother's, Grandmother's or Family Button Box. About Myself and How I got into Buttons - I qualified as a Fine Art and Chattels Valuer / Appraiser in College and worked in the City of London valuing the Art and Antiques of the Rich and Famous for mainly Insurance purposes. I was brought up in the Antique trade as my Mother who had been a top Knitwear Fashion Designer in the 60's with Twiggy etc. later got into Antiques and we lived over the shop for many years in Cardiff. I took over the business when I was 20 and by the time I qualified as a Valuer at 30 and started out in London another Financial Recession hit and I was back working as a Sole Trader. After working at the famous street markets, like Covent Garden, Campden Passage, etc. I set up shop at the Antiques centre in the Kings Road ,Chelsea selling Costume jewellery and with the Fashion scene all around me and knowing from my background that Buttons to a Designer garment, can be as important as a Frame to a Painting,  I started selling buttons. I've never stopped trading and collecting them and I now have a stock of around 100,000 buttons (650 different styles online). I am passionate about my work and somehow I have had a living out of it (plus doing lots of other work, such as writing, teaching, interior design, acting, having paying guests to my Art studio/Button warehouse in Budapest.etc) except any spare money somehow gets ploughed back into the business and more Interesting Vintage and Antique buttons with the future dream of a Museum. So if I could only turn some of the buttons into money..(some of the gold ones are like Pirates gold treasure!! See the Perk below! And at the end of my story!) then the buttons would pay for the first stage of my plan for the Museum and pay for the building plot in the most perfect place for it.
Perk 6. Gold Art Nouveau-style Metal Buttons Set  contains 4 High quality Honey gilt solid metal  alloy in an Art Nouveau-style with Rococo elements that are like pieces of jewellery. Wonderful on a black or darker colours to richly transform an outfit or give a short jacket the Chanel-look.

  Well life never always turns out like you plan and it certainly
 throws you a few curve balls. Mine was that I'm only child and my 
Mother was a Hungarian refugee from 1956 who was actually homesick all 
the time in the Cold War in Britain until my parents retired to Hungary in 1997. 
Sadly after 3 years Dad passed away so for the last 14 years I started 
living half the time in Budapest and half in London. Over that time I have seen many changes, learnt the language (somewhat!) and integrated into the wonderful cultural Budapest city life. Taste was very different and I couldn't sell my Vintage buttons here at first while a Vintage Fashion explosion was happening in London; the opposite was going on in Budapest; as everyone had put up with Secondhand and drab Hand-me downs through Communism so they wanted bright, shiny, new, Designer labels etc. but now that has changed and I have become well-known in the city, selling my buttons and book at the markets.

Perk 2. Pewter Encased Grey-Green Pearl Buttons Set contains 6 Antiqued pewter metal framed domed green-grey Mother-of-Pearl effect plastic tiny buttons that are suitable for a shirt, cardigan or a blouse to give it an interesting Celtic Ancient-look.
Size. Dia. 15.2mm L.24
What is difficult in Hungary although it has been part of the European Union for 20 years is that the wages for the People have just not gone up as in other Western countries. Id say an average wage for a Man with a Wife and family is around 500 $ or Euros a month. To integrate I had to take a 90% drop in the money I charged compared with London, say for my Interior design work or Art and Antiques valuation. Except somehow the Cost of Living is cheaper than other Western countries and you can mange quite well and have a good life. That is why so many artists, writers, and self employed Ex-pats live here. Of course Tourists love it as they feel like Kings or Queens with their spending power and there are so many Cultural things to do, like Opera, spa baths, architecture, restaurants, bars, all of which are very affordable. I have been having Guests from all over the World stay at my Button studio in the city for the last 4 years and they love it with my local cultural knowledge in the Art and Antiques scene - that's how Ive managed to pay the rent. So much that many return and are now venturing outside the capital.


  Perk 3. Mother-of-Pearl Shirt Stud Buttons Set contains 6 Vintage real white quality Mother-of -pearl  stud buttons with carved detail that are very sought after by Gentlemen for the their Evening or Dress shirts (which normally require 3 or 4). These buttons will be supplied with detachable rings as in the Old Days when you could remove them from garment to garment.
Size. Dia. 0.5 inch (12.7mm) L.20
I travelled all over Hungary and there are some beautiful places but one stuck out to me from all the others. I had heard of an old King's Hunting lodge and it is just on the edge of the city Public transport railway line. The Hunting lodge turned out to be a Classical Palladian house (similar to Chiswick House in London) on the riverbank of the Danube in a 500 year old settlement. It is a beautiful, picturesque and tranquil Heritage Village. It has a  church that has Hieronymus Bosch-like fresco work in bright colours that has never been restored, as good as any in Florence, Italy. The village has a Riverside market where twice a week, thousands of locals from the neighbouring villages and towns sell their produce (all organic) and crafted wares and there is also the thermal water there so there are 3 Four * Hotels and it has a few tiny museums (one is a Cowboy and Indian Museum!) and many Nature trails. Tourists have doubled from 20,000 to 40,000 per annum in this last year. I have become a frequent visitor there and surprisingly discovered that the property was not expensive..one because the Riverside Market is so good that the High St. remains empty of businesses unable to compete and there are no jobs for the locals other than traveling into the city (which is 50 minutes on the City Line and 20 minutes in a car). Although the Spa hotels are fully booked with tourists,,  other than the Market, there are no Art gallery shops or tourist craft shops. I know it is the best place for my Button business and Museum. It will put the place on the map and I will have a ready audience for my Buttons and Museum.
IPerk 4. Brass 4-Hole Buttons Set contains 6 real brass metal buttons.These have had a patination on them so no need to polish them and will look great on coats, leathers and jackets.Size Dia. 1 inch (25.4mm) L.40So for the last couple of years I have been studying everything about this Heritage Village and researching the property market. I have got my Hungarian papers (as I have Dual Nationality). I had seen a country shop with a 25 sq m wooden house for about that price of my savings and thought it would be a good place to start out and look for a premises once I was part of the Community. Anyway I was just about to try and buy it when it went off the market so I started hunting with other agents and then out of the blue found a property that had been reduced to half price because it had been empty for 4 years, right next to the 500 year old church, which is the best central location. So a real antique peasant house, in sound condition with good storage units for the buttons and with a very very big garden plot 600 sq m, enough to extend the existing 100sqm house or build another separate building such as my Button Museum. So I have half the Purchase money £11,000 of £22,000 and have to complete the purchase by the beginning of Spring but for a Single Woman like myself who has never had a regular income, only been in rentals, and is now not a Resident in the UK and neither has a work record income in Hungary..its going to be nigh impossible to borrow the money from a Bank. 
Perk 5. Natural Real Silvery White Rainbow Mother-of-Pearl Shell Buttons Set contains 6 quality Vintage Mother-of-Pearl buttons with beautiful rainbow colour highlights that you just don't get on Modern buttons but well matched for sets and with brass shanks. Suitable for any coat, jacket, etc.Size. Dia. (just under and inch) 22.9mm L.36So this is why I am asking if you will help Crowdfund this venture 
and purchase some of my beautiful buttons so that I can buy this plot 
with the house. Once this is done and if I am free of a loan I will be 
able restore this house within the year so I can have paying guests in the 
Summer while I make plans for a new structure or extension . I will work
 in the market to start with, make friends with the Community. Of course
 when the Museum is open it will be selling buttons in a shop section 
and therefor independently funding the running costs itself. When I am 
busy with the buttons then I always take on extra help. As with any 
business...we are never successful unless we can work with others. So 
even in my small business, there's been times when I have had six other 
people helping me with different jobs, such as the internet side of 
things, repairs, sales assistants, drivers, movers, collating and 
counting the buttons, packing orders, etc. Often in the past I have had many
women stuck at home for one reason or another, sewing the buttons on 
cards for me to earn a little extra money money and feel some self respect in their situations, The work is therapeutic and very satisfying. There is always work
 washing, sorting sewing the buttons as they are all recycled or old 
shop stocks. Buttons appeal to children and they will enjoy the Museum 
and learn. There will be craft workshops to make Button jewellery and other items.Perk 7. Silver Art Nouveau Lily Flower Buttons Set contains 4  fine quality silver metal alloy openwork design buttons with Lily flowers and leaves reminiscent of the Victorian Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau Movements in England . Suitable for a jacket, cardigan of any colour as the pierced design will let the fabric show through.Size. Dia. 0.75 inch (19.1mm) L.30 I think I will really add something to this small Community and I know 
people from all over the World will come to see my buttons and travel 
out on the City Line from Budapest when they are on holiday there. I 
will be happy to establish myself  and the buttons there and I know it 
will be one day be one of the magic places to visit in this city.Perk 8. Georgian Antiqued Silver Buttons Set contains 4 superb quality Antiqued Pewter alloy metal buttons that look like real 18th century silver ones with the detail and antique patination. They even look a bit Navaho Indian style. Suitable for Blazers, Coats, Jackets.Size.

</div></div>","Hi, I'm Lisa Gen, and I'm based in Paris, France. For the past twenty years my creator Tom Pastor has worked as a visual 3D artist specialized in furry creatures (e.g. the dragons in GoT). But he always wanted to create his own project ...and after 5 years (Ish) here I am !









Lisa Gen 5




____________________________________________________________________






I'm a full computer graphics 3d human model to give fashion designers the opportunity to create pictures never seen before. Tom started (M!) from scratch and I’m still getting upgrades everyday.
It took him five years of hard work during long nights. I am 100% digital and I have been crafted with passion and a perfect convergence of technology & art.


Lisa Gen 7

I'm the result of putting together the most beautiful women in the world.
But I'm not just the digital double, the scan of one model, I’m Lisa Gen 7, and you won’t find someone like me anywhere else.





My target :

My job is to do photo shootings wearing dresses that don’t exist, or even dresses that can not be done in real !

Let’s imagine a dress made out of snow or soap bubbles with ME (Lisa) holding a balloon filled with water and golden fishes inside …. being shot from different camera angles !
But the goal is to do a full CGI commercial, for perfume for example ! It is the bridge between Fashion and Film industry, a brand new business model !

What we need
Today we have to face the limits of this project. Why ? 
For the intense rendering process we need more machines, for the details and for the animation. Also we'll need 3d freelancers to help improving me.
We would need powerful Xeon PC's with a high level of memory to be able to realize my creator's crazy ideas.






Risks & Challenges

In exchange of your precious help, we will deliver very high quality products based on ""Lisa style"": E-Books, hard copy books, pictures collection (Limited edition). 




The challenge is to make everyone happy about the products and to deliver everyone as soon as we can. 
All products will be double checked before delivering.

Delivery expectation: End of September, middle October.  Delivery is included in the price. Photo frames include number for each picture on the back.






Other ways you can help

Tom is holding this project on his own for the past five years. He wants this project to flourish and be shared with other talented people …Being on Indiegogo is also one great way of getting in touch with people. If you are a creator for fashion or just a creator, film maker or even a journalist who’s willing to talk about Lisa, that would seriously help. Stories about Lisa are endless …
New doors for creativity and new ideas are now open ...

Please get in touch with Tom : tom@cloudofisolt.com
Thanks for your time.

Lisa

<h3>SCRUZ Duotone Sunglasses for a 3D World<br/>
</h3> <p>From the founders of Vogmask, the world's premier designer filtering face mask, comes the biggest innovation in sunglasses since polarization, multi-hued lenses. Offering three lens color combinations, Blue Raspberry, Lemon Lime, or Orange Purps,  each duotone option has a unique design lightweight wood frame.  We created these sunglasses because we wanted them for ourselves. With prototypes in hand we showed them to all our friends. That's how the video came about. People are curious if they make the world look more 3D. That depends on who you ask and what the light is like at the time. Most people say that detail is perfect and overall vision is wonderfully enhanced in SCRUZ Duotone Sunglasses.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Our Unique Product<br/>
</h3>Beginning with multi-hued lenses, we sourced the best manufacturing in the world.  SCRUZ Duotones feature frames elegantly crafted from FSC certified wenge wood.  Wood frames are light,  eco-friendly, absorb sweat and feel soft against the skin. Special flex hinges can take a beating without breaking. We recommend them for skateboarding, biking, dancing, surfing or just chilling. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440262170/tk4r2sihc7dl3o09uftl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Multi-Hued (Duotone) Lenses?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Because they look awesome. Why do people wear sunglasses? To look cool and for eye protection. SCRUZ Duotones Sunglasses take the looking cool part to a whole new level, while providing FDA and CE certified protection. The key to our sunglasses are the lenses. Using ultimate mirrored lenses, SCRUZ achieves an iconic look and perfect protection. The lenses are CE and FDA certified UV400,  the highest protective rating. They are also 100% polarized, reducing glare and eyestrain, and adding happiness.</p>

 From the founders of Vogmask, the world's premier designer filtering face mask, comes the biggest innovation in sunglasses since polarization, multi-hued lenses. Offering three lens color combinations, Blue Raspberry, Lemon Lime, or Orange Purps,  each duotone option has a unique design lightweight wood frame.  We created these sunglasses because we wanted them for ourselves. With prototypes in hand we showed them to all our friends. That's how the video came about. People are curious if they make the world look more 3D. That depends on who you ask and what the light is like at the time. Most people say that detail is perfect and overall vision is wonderfully enhanced in SCRUZ Duotone Sunglasses.



Our Unique Product
Beginning with multi-hued lenses, we sourced the best manufacturing in the world.  SCRUZ Duotones feature frames elegantly crafted from FSC certified wenge wood.  Wood frames are light,  eco-friendly, absorb sweat and feel soft against the skin. Special flex hinges can take a beating without breaking. We recommend them for skateboarding, biking, dancing, surfing or just chilling. 

Why Multi-Hued (Duotone) Lenses?

Because they look awesome. Why do people wear sunglasses? To look cool and for eye protection. SCRUZ Duotones Sunglasses take the looking cool part to a whole new level, while providing FDA and CE certified protection. The key to our sunglasses are the lenses. Using ultimate mirrored lenses, SCRUZ achieves an iconic look and perfect protection. The lenses are CE and FDA certified UV400,  the highest protective rating. They are also 100% polarized, reducing glare and eyestrain, and adding happiness.



    Risks 
This is a very low risk campaign proposition.  We have a high quality product,  a fully sourced supply chain, an existing structure of design, logistics, fulfillment, and an experienced team with successful track record establishing Vogmask.

Did you know?  Each lens color on sunglasses improves vision in a particular way, reducing eye fatigue.  Lemon Lime SCRUZ combine the advantage of green lens for high contrast vision while cycling, water sports, mountain biking, skiing and playing tennis, while in the same pair you have yellow lens filtering blue light and providing added clarity in these same sports.Regarding our goal of $18,888
Many people have asked us 
about our goal of $18,888.  Manufacturing minimums at our premium 
suppliers, packaging cost, and shipping to our fulfillment center in 
South San Francisco for order processing will total approximately

</h3><p>I'm creating a new line of motivating athletic apparel and just getting it off the ground.  They are for average Joe's  and Jane's on the path to greater things! We aren't all fitness models or bodybuilders; some of us never want to be but we enjoy the activities that love and work hard at them. We might not be the best of the best but who cares! Hence the Practice Squad name; currently the underdog but working hard to be the best that we can be, while having fun! <br/></p><p>I am one of those regular Joe's that I was talking about. One day I jumped on the scale and saw that I was the heaviest I've ever been and I needed to make a change. So I got off my butt and joined a gym and started working out. I had a goal in mind and worked my butt off to get there. Here are some of my before and after pictures to show you what I mean.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441351454/dhkz0pmetvik4pytrgus.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 167px; height: 206px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441351286/kwmtjl0i4uvqjmbit2f4.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 132.052px; height: 207px;""/></p>I lost 30 pounds plugging away at what I enjoyed. I know that there are days where you can just use a little motivation to give you that kick you need to keep pushing. I had some motivational T-shirts that helped me get through it. I didn't feel comfortable wearing those bodybuilder type shirts that are all about muscles etc. because I wasn't that person. I was just a guy who wanted to get into shape and get there by never giving up on my goal. I want to help people reach theirs too! I know a t-shirt won't get you there but they can help you along the way to help keep you focused on what you want. My main goal is to help others. I get asked all the time on ""How I did it?"", ""What do I need to do to do the same?"" and ""Was it hard?"".<span> I tell them that it wasn’t hard for me only because it was something 
that I truly wanted to do. It was a passion and a personal challenge. It
 took a lot of work, dedication, sacrifices, and will power. When they 
say “hard work”, I think of the last two. I think this is what people 
consider to be the “hard work”. Do they have to sacrifice some things 
and do they have to resist temptations…..absolutely!! You have to get 
out of your comfort zone and do things that you aren't used to doing. 
But if you want something bad enough, your desire to achieve your goal 
will overpower the rest. The things that seem strange at the beginning 
become habit and a lifestyle. You just have to grind it out until it 
becomes your everyday routine and your old lifestyle or routine seems 
strange. This is only the beginning for me. I can't wait to see how far I
 can go!<br/><br/>These T-shirts are what I'm all about and my philosophy. When I get the thought in my head that I could just skip a day or two, I look at the shirts and remember why I started. I have made some demo shirts already that I wear around the house and at the gym. They are extremely comfortable, breathable, good to just wear when you're lounging at home on an rest day.<br/><br/></span><p>If I can get the funding I can expand the selection of products (Tank Tops, Shorts, Sweats, Yoga Pants, Hats, etc.). I have a vision of where I want to see the company go but need a little help to get me there. I want to expand the business beyond North America and create more motivational wears, not just something you can workout in. I want to bring out more positivity. I'm sure we all have seen enough negativity on the TV and Social Media. How about something uplifting for a change?<br/></p><p>I am currently working on a website for the apparel line.<br/></p><h3>The Designs:</h3><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684041/cp0sicskve91gu9ofpls.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 250.278px; height: 212px;""/></p><p>Never Give Up Design <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684071/mowcwvyteaifsyaapnqi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 250.362px; height: 212px;""/></p><p>Stars Design<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684104/sly18k896gxv0ymowpwq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 253.845px; height: 215px;""/></p><p>Only the Beginning Design</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684135/ekblp6cn3nkz5rrl36zv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 256.769px; height: 217px;""/></p>Success Design<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684161/jxbejvf1bklo3zu4wycj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 252.856px; height: 214px;""/></p>Change Design<br/><br/><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684190/fdvddeedb0cc76jg09q6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 252.098px; height: 214px;""/></p>Future Design<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684230/qnfylwlsy6qkaxpbhpok.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 254.543px; height: 216px;""/></p>Better Design<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684271/worrv2tmy3yfqncyb9a3.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 256.455px; height: 217px;""/></p>Coming Design<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684304/ojnwe4lbso5wtja0xz1b.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 261.856px; height: 223px;""/></p>Grind Design<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441684353/cqjnje0sbeeyjxfquucm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 266.741px; height: 226px;""/></p>Stronger Design<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>

Founded in 2014,
BLUESY is a leather goods brand whose inspiration originates from the United Kingdom. Combining timeless
designs with upgraded modern details, our handbags highlight the characteristics and
spirit of BLUESY – Merging the style of BLUESY with your own to celebrate
individuality. With the specially-designed, patented features, your favorite
elements can be attached to create a personalized BLUESY handbag.Ideas behindPatented Bag DesignsBLUESY proudly presents our first collection of signature handbags “Ala”. Inspired by the beauty of birds, simple yet elegant blue-toned colors are employed to bring out the unique style of our brand. We believe that simplicity allows room for originality, a core spirit definitive of BLUESY.Patented Lock Closure DesignsThe idea of the lock closure imitates birds habit of carrying precious glittering gems to their nest. The charms attached on the lock closure represent customers' treasures as it shows the unique style of each owner.Enhanced User-FriendlinessDespite the extravagant look, we realized the functionality of the handbag is also of paramount importance, therefore somehow find a way to embed it into our contemporary design we did.1. Our lightweight handbags with shoulder strap enable easy carriage, along with the delicately arranged nylon inner compartments which allow users to separately nestle their belongings.2. The “Wings” design allows users to conveniently reach into the chambers on both sides of the bag for storing daily necessities.3. The leather strings attached to the zipper form the shape of the “wings” while ensuring a smoother opening of the zipper.BLUESY Ala Bags

This whole-body transportation has amazing power in influencing and conditioning our mindset and emotions. Now imagine what could happen if this power was harnessed and combined with the healing energy of crystals and shaped into a powerful tool that could be used to evoke a self-transformation…</p><p>Introducing the first high-vibe, self-care fragrance collection that was created with love to fight through fears and limiting belief patterns and help you to co-create and manifest your desires.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to your ASCENTION</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2>Creating a New Category of Clean Beauty and Wellness:</h2><ul>
<li>Created by beauty industry expert, Greta Fitz, who couldn't find the suitable holistic beauty products for self-help and healing. </li>
<li>Designed mindfully with the right amount of clean ingredients for the right amount of effect.</li>
<li>Each scent evokes aspired emotions which are conditioned through a customized ritual.</li>
<li>Double patented bottle design that protects the authentic crystal in a separate chamber.</li>
<li>Responsibly produced with materials that can be reused and recycled.</li>
<li>Exclusive partnership with Columbia Gem House, the first fair-trade gem supplier.</li>
<li>Mindfully and minimally packaged with only what you need and nothing more.<br/> </li>
</ul><h2>About The Brand:</h2><p>Ascention was created and manifested by female founder, Greta Fitz, who has over two decades of experience as a marketing executive in the beauty and fragrance industries. Her work on Ascention earned her a prestigious spot as a 2019 Sephora Accelerate Cohort, which is a program dedicated to building a community of innovative female founders in beauty. In its most competitive and diverse year yet, Greta was one of 14 chosen from thousands of applicants worldwide.  And of those 14, Greta was the only participant whose startup is in the pre-revenue stage.</p><p>After coming to a crossroads due to a serious health scare, Greta decided to reprioritize her life and conquer her fears. When she looked to holistic self-help in beauty, she couldn't find it. During her research, she saw a staggering number of searches for self-healing, anti-stress, depression and anxiety, and quickly realized that she wasn’t alone in the fight. The global wellness industry is valued at ~$4.2 trillion, the self-care industry, ~$10 billion.  Consumers are tired of numbing the pain. They are becoming more conscientious of how modern medications are affecting their bodies and minds and realizing that sometimes you must go through the pain in order to grow and to evolve. Need proof? Look at any hashtag on instagram: #crystalhealing, <strong>2.8MM</strong> posts. #selflove,<strong> 27MM</strong> posts. #selfcare, <strong>14MM</strong> posts. #wellness, <strong>26MM</strong> posts. #cleanbeauty, <strong>1.3MM</strong> posts. #ascension, <strong>1.1MM</strong> posts. The zeitgeist is ready to ascend.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>A wellness revolution has begun.</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2>Our Distinct Point of Difference:</h2><p>Exclusively partnering with world-renowned perfume house, MANE, ASCENTION fragrances are non-toxic, vegan, cruelty-free, and linear, meaning that the scent will stay the same from the initial spray, to when the fragrance dries on your skin. This means no headaches, and no surprises. </p><p>Our 6 fragrances were designed around the aspired emotions of love, peace, wisdom, prosperity, courage, and detox, respectively, and paired with a responsibly-sourced crystal to match.  In an age where there is so much emphasis on being educated about what you are putting in and on your body, we feel that it is equally important to know how and where your products were sourced.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Have you ever considered what it took for your crystals to make their way into your hands? And are they even real?</p><p>Most people haven’t, and that’s why we are thrilled to announce that ASCENTION BEAUTY CO. has entered into an exclusive partnership with an authentic, responsibly-sourced crystal supplier, Columbia Gem House.  They have developed the industry’s first fair-trade and quality assurance program, meaning that every single one of their crystals is closely tracked from mine to market to ensure that they have been handled and treated according to strict protocols. That means NO toxic synthetics or “enhancements,” NO dangerous labor conditions, NO unfair wages, and NO unnecessary environmental destruction.</p><p>This information is overwhelmingly undisclosed by other suppliers and retailers, and ASCENTION x Columbia Gem House hope to pioneer a industry-wide standard for how our beautiful crystals are mined and treated, so that we can truly tap into their unobstructed healing properties and feel good about doing so.</p><p>That being said, our crystals are not submerged in the fragrance; rather, we’ve created a double patented bottle design that holds the stone in a separate chamber, keeping your crystal and juice safe from contamination, and allowing the crystal’s healing powers to energetically permeate into the fragrance.</p><p>This ensures that your ritualistic journey is 100% custom. The crystals can be cleansed and charged with YOUR intentions, and they are not influenced by anyone else’s energy.  Our key points of difference truly innovate a new category and standard of clean beauty and wellness. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>Backing ASCENTION Is Showing Up For Yourself:</strong></h2><p>At ASCENTION, we are led by synchronicities and believe that everything happens for a reason.

This whole-body transportation has amazing power in influencing and conditioning our mindset and emotions. Now imagine what could happen if this power was harnessed and combined with the healing energy of crystals and shaped into a powerful tool that could be used to evoke a self-transformation…Introducing the first high-vibe, self-care fragrance collection that was created with love to fight through fears and limiting belief patterns and help you to co-create and manifest your desires.Welcome to your ASCENTION Creating a New Category of Clean Beauty and Wellness:
Created by beauty industry expert, Greta Fitz, who couldn't find the suitable holistic beauty products for self-help and healing. 
Designed mindfully with the right amount of clean ingredients for the right amount of effect.
Each scent evokes aspired emotions which are conditioned through a customized ritual.
Double patented bottle design that protects the authentic crystal in a separate chamber.
Responsibly produced with materials that can be reused and recycled.
Exclusive partnership with Columbia Gem House, the first fair-trade gem supplier.
Mindfully and minimally packaged with only what you need and nothing more. 
About The Brand:Ascention was created and manifested by female founder, Greta Fitz, who has over two decades of experience as a marketing executive in the beauty and fragrance industries. Her work on Ascention earned her a prestigious spot as a 2019 Sephora Accelerate Cohort, which is a program dedicated to building a community of innovative female founders in beauty. In its most competitive and diverse year yet, Greta was one of 14 chosen from thousands of applicants worldwide.  And of those 14, Greta was the only participant whose startup is in the pre-revenue stage.After coming to a crossroads due to a serious health scare, Greta decided to reprioritize her life and conquer her fears. When she looked to holistic self-help in beauty, she couldn't find it. During her research, she saw a staggering number of searches for self-healing, anti-stress, depression and anxiety, and quickly realized that she wasn’t alone in the fight. The global wellness industry is valued at ~$4.2 trillion, the self-care industry, ~$10 billion.  Consumers are tired of numbing the pain. They are becoming more conscientious of how modern medications are affecting their bodies and minds and realizing that sometimes you must go through the pain in order to grow and to evolve. Need proof? Look at any hashtag on instagram: #crystalhealing, 2.8MM posts. #selflove, 27MM posts. #selfcare, 14MM posts. #wellness, 26MM posts. #cleanbeauty, 1.3MM posts. #ascension, 1.1MM posts. The zeitgeist is ready to ascend.A wellness revolution has begun. Our Distinct Point of Difference:Exclusively partnering with world-renowned perfume house, MANE, ASCENTION fragrances are non-toxic, vegan, cruelty-free, and linear, meaning that the scent will stay the same from the initial spray, to when the fragrance dries on your skin. This means no headaches, and no surprises. Our 6 fragrances were designed around the aspired emotions of love, peace, wisdom, prosperity, courage, and detox, respectively, and paired with a responsibly-sourced crystal to match.  In an age where there is so much emphasis on being educated about what you are putting in and on your body, we feel that it is equally important to know how and where your products were sourced.Have you ever considered what it took for your crystals to make their way into your hands? And are they even real?Most people haven’t, and that’s why we are thrilled to announce that ASCENTION BEAUTY CO. has entered into an exclusive partnership with an authentic, responsibly-sourced crystal supplier, Columbia Gem House.  They have developed the industry’s first fair-trade and quality assurance program, meaning that every single one of their crystals is closely tracked from mine to market to ensure that they have been handled and treated according to strict protocols. That means NO toxic synthetics or “enhancements,” NO dangerous labor conditions, NO unfair wages, and NO unnecessary environmental destruction.This information is overwhelmingly undisclosed by other suppliers and retailers, and ASCENTION x Columbia Gem House hope to pioneer a industry-wide standard for how our beautiful crystals are mined and treated, so that we can truly tap into their unobstructed healing properties and feel good about doing so.That being said, our crystals are not submerged in the fragrance; rather, we’ve created a double patented bottle design that holds the stone in a separate chamber, keeping your crystal and juice safe from contamination, and allowing the crystal’s healing powers to energetically permeate into the fragrance.This ensures that your ritualistic journey is 100% custom. The crystals can be cleansed and charged with YOUR intentions, and they are not influenced by anyone else’s energy.  Our key points of difference truly innovate a new category and standard of clean beauty and wellness.  Backing ASCENTION Is Showing Up For Yourself:At ASCENTION, we are led by synchronicities and believe that everything happens for a reason. Like attracts like, and whatever energy we put out into the world will always come back, and the more we give, the more we receive.  This is not just an investment in a brand, but an investment in yourself. From emerging talent to the best-in-the-business, ASCENTION was brought to life by a pack of experts who share in this vision of creating a life-changing new category of ritualistic beauty and demanding a higher standard of clean and sustainable products.  And as you can imagine, delivering this package to the world is an ambitious and expensive task, but we are always up for a challenge!  As an entrepreneur and single mom, Greta Fitz strives to instill in her two young boys and those that follow in her collective that miracles are possible, and you can do anything when you put your mind and intent behind it. ASCENTION Was Created For You, But It Can't Happen Without You:These high-vibe fragrances are not being pushed out through a multi-million dollar corporation.

In 2013 I was incarcerated, where I worked in a sewing workshop and was fortunate enough to train in garment making. It was this experience that led me to the realisation of my mission. My time inside and the skills I acquired allowed me to visualise and create Nrd. Nrd is an acronym for my name and nickname Nicole ‘Red’ Douglas. Pronounced “nerd”. Nrd is a fashion brand which represents freedom and individuality. My circumstances have redirected me towards a purposeful mission to help ex offenders like myself find a positive path and I hope in the long term to outsource some of Nrd’s manufacturing back into HMP and to offer work and training to ex offenders like myself. <strong>It's more than fashion!</strong> </p><p>This campaign is extremely important to me as it will allow me to take Nrd to the next level. A ready to wear collection is crucial for the evolution of the brand. The support of my network and people near and far will mean so much to the Nrd journey. A small contribution can mean the difference between a one woman band producing garments at one or two pieces a day, a few days a week to a mass production of specific garments ready for sale online and in select boutiques. It will mean I can hire seamstresses and graders to help with my designs and sizing on a large scale. It will in turn allow me the time to target my ideal customers with an online based marketing campaign. It will ensure that Nrd grows to a level where we can employ staff, offer opportunities to ex offenders and explore the avenue of manufacturing Nrd garments in Prison workshops, giving prisoners the opportunity to be part of the movement. It won't be an easy process but I am determined to make it work and give back as I am morally indebted to the opportunities I received in my darkest hours. These opportunities got me through and without my past Nrd wouldn't be my present and I wouldn't have this amazing vision and plan for the future.    </p><p><strong><u>What Nrd Needs and What You Get</u></strong></p><p>I am asking for £6000 to follow through with my 2017 Nrd ready to wear plan. I have conducted research into costs as well as obtaining quotes from specific companies who I will do business with in regards to products (such as fabric) and services (such as embroidery).</p><p><u><strong>The Collection</strong></u></p><p>The forthcoming collection has been designed and includes pieces for both men and women as well as some unisex garments. It includes pieces such as hats, hoodies and jumpers, as well as some two piece sets of shorts and tops, shorts and bandanas and dresses and jackets. Following on from the last summers theme I will be incorporating some African and Exotic prints as well as  trending colour schemes alongside simple yet quirky designs. </p><p><b><u>Where Your Money Goes</u></b></p><p>Fabric - £820    </p><p>Hats - £200</p><p>Embroidery - £330</p><p>Print - £260</p><p>Labels - £140 </p><p>Business Cards/ Flyers - £60 </p><p>Pattern Cutters/ Seamstress - £450 (£18 per hour x 25 hours)</p><p>Graders - £360                      </p><p>Factory Manufacturing - £2000</p><p>Marketing - £270</p><p>Postage and Packaging - £1110</p><p>Total - £6000</p><p>Hitting the £6000 target will get us off to an amazing start and the collection will immediately go into production.  Contributors will have the opportunity to be rewarded with perks such as 10% off the collection and a complimentary 'It's more than fashion' Nrd T-shirt.</p><p>No matter how much we raise through the campaign we will push on towards our goals by looking at alternative avenues to raise extra money and put the collection out there for the world to see. If we exceed our target the extra contributions will go towards further expanding the brand.</p><p><strong><u>The Impact</u></strong></p><p>It is important that as people we come together to support one another. I believe that everything happens for a reason. I also believe in second chances. In the UK at least a quarter of offenders reoffend within a year of release from prison. After experiencing the prison system first hand I was determined not to be in the negative 25% of that equation. I made a decision and fixated on my dream and grabbed every opportunity that would aid me in the pursuit of my that dream.

Conceived in incarceration, born of emancipation.</strong></p><p><strong>Its more than fashion!</strong></p><p><strong>Thank You!</strong></p></div>","Conceived In IncarcerationI have always dreamt of being my own boss and an unfortunate circumstance lead me towards the realisation of my ultimate dream. In 2013 I was incarcerated, where I worked in a sewing workshop and was fortunate enough to train in garment making. It was this experience that led me to the realisation of my mission. My time inside and the skills I acquired allowed me to visualise and create Nrd. Nrd is an acronym for my name and nickname Nicole ‘Red’ Douglas. Pronounced “nerd”. Nrd is a fashion brand which represents freedom and individuality. My circumstances have redirected me towards a purposeful mission to help ex offenders like myself find a positive path and I hope in the long term to outsource some of Nrd’s manufacturing back into HMP and to offer work and training to ex offenders like myself. It's more than fashion! This campaign is extremely important to me as it will allow me to take Nrd to the next level. A ready to wear collection is crucial for the evolution of the brand. The support of my network and people near and far will mean so much to the Nrd journey. A small contribution can mean the difference between a one woman band producing garments at one or two pieces a day, a few days a week to a mass production of specific garments ready for sale online and in select boutiques. It will mean I can hire seamstresses and graders to help with my designs and sizing on a large scale. It will in turn allow me the time to target my ideal customers with an online based marketing campaign. It will ensure that Nrd grows to a level where we can employ staff, offer opportunities to ex offenders and explore the avenue of manufacturing Nrd garments in Prison workshops, giving prisoners the opportunity to be part of the movement. It won't be an easy process but I am determined to make it work and give back as I am morally indebted to the opportunities I received in my darkest hours. These opportunities got me through and without my past Nrd wouldn't be my present and I wouldn't have this amazing vision and plan for the future.    What Nrd Needs and What You GetI am asking for £6000 to follow through with my 2017 Nrd ready to wear plan. I have conducted research into costs as well as obtaining quotes from specific companies who I will do business with in regards to products (such as fabric) and services (such as embroidery).The CollectionThe forthcoming collection has been designed and includes pieces for both men and women as well as some unisex garments. It includes pieces such as hats, hoodies and jumpers, as well as some two piece sets of shorts and tops, shorts and bandanas and dresses and jackets. Following on from the last summers theme I will be incorporating some African and Exotic prints as well as  trending colour schemes alongside simple yet quirky designs. Where Your Money GoesFabric - £820    Hats - £200Embroidery - £330Print - £260Labels - £140 Business Cards/ Flyers - £60 Pattern Cutters/ Seamstress - £450 (£18 per hour x 25 hours)Graders - £360                      Factory Manufacturing - £2000Marketing - £270Postage and Packaging - £1110Total - £6000Hitting the £6000 target will get us off to an amazing start and the collection will immediately go into production.  Contributors will have the opportunity to be rewarded with perks such as 10% off the collection and a complimentary 'It's more than fashion' Nrd T-shirt.No matter how much we raise through the campaign we will push on towards our goals by looking at alternative avenues to raise extra money and put the collection out there for the world to see. If we exceed our target the extra contributions will go towards further expanding the brand.The ImpactIt is important that as people we come together to support one another. I believe that everything happens for a reason. I also believe in second chances. In the UK at least a quarter of offenders reoffend within a year of release from prison. After experiencing the prison system first hand I was determined not to be in the negative 25% of that equation. I made a decision and fixated on my dream and grabbed every opportunity that would aid me in the pursuit of my that dream. Not everyone going through the prison system is fortunate enough to receive the opportunities I did. Failure is not an option. Whatever obstacles have come my way and are headed towards me I have and will continue to find a way through. I want to be a positive example of what people can achieve when they set their mind to it. I want to be like the people who offered me the opportunity to learn a skill and find a way through a dark situation.

She saw other women commuting to work with the same problem, and decided that we deserve better bags to support or busy lifestyles.  From here Workingurl Co. was born.All Workingurl bags are made to be high quality, versatile, and durable. The new BusyHer Collection is a 3-in-1 bag, that is both elegant and athletic, all while being comfortable and practical. Most importantly they are designed by women, for women! BusyHer Bags can be worn as a shoulder bag (tote), as a backpack, or as crossbody.  Just clip and unclip the straps to change the style.   The BusyHer Collection fits all lifestyles for all women.  Utilizing feedback from customers and influencers who have been carrying our bags since our first small production, we have improved the design and overall aesthetic for this new line.  Whether you're on the go, at the office, heading to the gym, running errands, or traveling, BusyHer bags will carry everything you need and keep you looking chic.   Like our first line, the BusyHer Collection is made of a premium, highly-durable nylon.  While sourcing this nylon, we made sure to select the top-performing choice for rugged applications where durability and abrasion resistance are a high priority. Our nylon is strong, lightweight, and has greater stretchability.  It' s also easy to clean and wrinkle resistant, qualities that make it the perfect choice for our customers. 


 

 
   Carrying your day is made simple and easy with BusyHer bags. The BusyHer Collection has all of the signature features that our customers love, allowing busy women to carry their entire day in just one bag.  There are 11 pockets and compartments including, a separate shoe compartment, a 13"" padded laptop compartment, two bottle holders, a detachable key fob, pen and pencil holders, cell phone pocket, and plenty of other pockets and space.    Carry your day and organize your everyday essentials.  Backers can choose a single bag perk with either the Navy (Lisa Bag), or Gray (Christa Bag).We introduced our original bags to customers almost three years ago with a small batch of our bags, and have helped busy women carry their everyday essentials since. Here's what they say about our bags:""I have had my bag for nearly three years. It still looks brand new! As a working artist, I put this bag through hell & back. I use it for my laptop, umbrella, paint supplies, shoes, extra clothes, water bottle...all at the same time! The best purchase I’ve made in a long time."" - Tracy Barbosa""I was one of your first customers and I'm still using your bag. It has held up despite how ridiculously heavy I make the bag each day. I've taken it on countless international trips for both work and play! I've bought other bags and the handles end up snapping in a month, this is going on years and still looks great!"" - ‎Justine Grossman‎ ""Before my WorkinGurl Co. bag, I literally carried three bags to work (purse, gym bag, lunch bag) every single day...taking the subway was a nightmare! Now, I just fill up my WorkinGurl Co. bag and go. The convenient pockets allow me to actually find things (i.e. my keys, wallet, gym shoes, etc.) versus just buying a massive bag and losing things in the ""bag abyss"". I can't recommend these products enough, they make your life easier and you look good doing it!"" - Shani Sarkis ""Just got my bag today! Shipping was really quick! The bag itself is a great size. I just started a job where I'll be taking the train every day. This bag is a life saver. Having the spot in the bottom for shoes is perfect. If you commute like me, you need this bag."" - Rachel Nguyen  The nylon material we use is much lighter than leather. It gives customers  the ability to pack what they need for their day, without any added weight from a bag. It's also durable, strong, and waterproof. Now you can walk in the rain, contain spills from your drinks, and easily wipe and clean your bag without fear that it can get damaged.   Lighter than leather and waterproof!        Victoria started Workingurl Co. almost three years ago, after seeing a need for women's bags that are fashionable AND functional.  When commuting into Cambridge, Massachusetts for work, she found herself carrying 2-3 bags every day to hold her essentials.  She noticed other professional women having to deal with the same problem.  After searching online and in stores without any luck finding what she needed, she decided to create her own line of bags that would help simplify busy women's lives, without sacrificing style. Shortly after conceptualizing her first designs, she applied and was accepted into an accelerator for entrepreneurs.  She utilized the tools she learned from this competition to launch her first line through a Kickstarter campaign.  With the funds raised from this campaign, she produced and delivered a small batch of original Workingurl bags.  Since then, she's obtained customer feedback and worked to improve on the original design.

As soon as you start wearing your Subs, they will quickly mold to your feet, providing you with sturdy, long-lasting comfort. You will have a soft cushion of comfort with every step you take. Our tapered footbed guarantees you some extra durability where it's needed most in the heel. Straps: Our straps are designed and positioned so that you will not experience any irritation between your toes. The plugs are strong and durable as well, meaning that they will not easily blow out on you.Performance: Subs perform extremely well in wet conditions and off the beaten track situations too. The design on both the top and bottom of the soles allows you to get a great grip on any surface you happen to traverse in your adventures.Subs' Materials and FeaturesSubs flip-flops use 100% recycled & recyclable materialsRecycled plastic makes excellent sandals because it is highly durable, super comfortable, 100% safe to wear against your skin, and can be recycled over and over again. By purchasing this product you are taking a collective step in helping to reduce the ever increasing global plastic problem, plus you help fund the removal of marine debris, sweet!Upcycle your SubsWhen your Subs are worn out beyond use, and that could take ages, you can send them back to us for upcycling.  We have the ability to take old pairs, grind them up into pellets, put them back through the plastic injection machinery and make brand new pairs. Now, that's what we call sustainable! The Subs' team has strong ties to New Zealand and Australia, hence one of our personal favourites, introducing - The AnzacAlmost everything is made from recycled materials, packaging includedAll of our packaging is made from recycled paper, and of course is recyclable. Subs' pledge: 1 pair purchased = the removal of 1/2 a kg (1.16 lbs) of trash from our ocean ecosystems!Subs pledge to remove 1/2 a kg (that's 1.16 lbs) of debris from our coastline and ocean ecosystems for every pair sold, which means not only will you fund the removal of 1/2 a kg (1.16 lbs) of debris from our ocean ecosystems, you will also have a super comfy, highly durable pair of flip flops that are made from 100% recycled, recyclable and upcyclable materials!Plenty of the plastic debris recovered is recyclableWe have been beach cleaning for about a year now, and the amount of volunteers joining us is ever growing, with plenty of interest in different countries around the world in support of what we can do.Our impact to date: 3,584 kgs or 7,901 lbs of debris removed from our ocean eco-systemsSo far we've removed over 3,584 kgs of trash and counting, that's 7,901 lbs! We have been very pleased to find that a lot of the plastic we recover is recyclable, and after being further processed in recycling centers and refined into pallets we have some of our raw materials for manufacturing.The more we clean our ecosystems, the more we realise we can make an impact. Which is why WE NEED YOU to join us in taking steps for the ocean, because together we can make a large impact. Whether you're spreading the word, interested in volunteering, or can show your support with a purchase or two, you will be making an impact. Safety FirstSubs soles and straps are 100% SGS certified. That means that the materials we use have been tested and meet health, safety, and regulatory standards, Subs are totally safe to wear against your skin.REGULAR & SLENDER STYLE SUBS 11 Different Strap Colour OptionsRegular flip flops: The regular style of flip flops is for people with normal to wide feet. Our flip flops are unisex but the regular style is mainly suitable for men as it has larger sizes available.Due to our commitment to using 100% recycled plastic for our soles, we are currently limited to black soles, with 11 strap colour options.Slender flip flops: The slender style of flip flops is for people with slender to normal feet. Our flip flops are unisex but the slender style is mainly suitable for women as it has smaller sizes available.Sizes shown are US 10/11 Regular above and US 7/8 Slender below. Subs' Size GuideTo ensure you get the best fit possible, please refer to the size guide below. Subs use unisex sizing, divided between Regular fit soles and straps, and Slender fit soles and straps.Simply measure your foot and add about 2.5 cm or one inch, to your foot measurement to get your correct size. For example, if your foot is 25 cm long, add 2.5 cm and you should comfortably fit our size 9, which is 27.5 cm long. If your foot is 27 cm long, then you should fit our size 12 comfortably, which is 29.5 cm long, and so on.Customers with wide feet, and/or larger foot circumference, may want to consider ordering one size larger to accommodate additional foot volume around the strap.But, it's really up to you, some people prefer a bit of wriggle room behind the heel, whereas others are happy to have the back of the heel in line with the back of the sole. These two illustrations below demonstrate a couple of very common foot sizes. Please note that all measurements reflect the length of the sole, NOT the length of your foot!Where we begin...The Subs' story starts in Kyle, New Zealand, in the 1980s, where we grew up on a farm right next to the South West Pacific Ocean.Back then it was clear to us how our beaches were being affected by plastic waste, with fish and bird corpses constantly washing up ashore, mixed in with plastic waste from fishing nets, bottles and caps.Now, this problem affects the entire world and its food supply, with an estimated 5.2 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans, of which 269,000 tons float on the surface.There are five main concentrations of plastic, known as the 'gyres', the largest being estimated twice the size of Texas. Plastic pieces out number sea life in 'Great Pacific Garbage Patch' by 6 to 1.Hundreds of thousands of sea turtles, whales and other marine mammals and more than 1 million seabirds die each year from ocean pollution, and plastic ingestion, or entanglement in plastic debris.What we can do is alleviate these problems, and if you walk with us you will be taking some serious steps in the right direction for the ocean's ecosystemsOver 7 years experience in the footwear industryCollectively, team Subs has over 7 years experience in the footwear industry. We realised we were in a position to do something about the world's extreme plastic pollution problem, and the idea was born to create a footwear product that could sustain the reduction of plastic in our ocean and coastline ecosystems, and recycled plastic in general, by using that plastic as footwear. TestingWe have done extensive testing, including, but not limited to, walking (shock horror), running, skipping, boxing, hiking, surfing, waterfall jumping/swimming.WaterfallNon-slip on rocks, even when submerged in running water.HikingWent for a little stroll up a mountain while testing a heavier/harder style of subs, have to say I'm glad it was me and not anyone else because they were wayyyyy too hard, great test, except it was during winter and I had no shoes, no frost bite but safe to say next time I'll take some shoes and socks also.Natural Hot SpringsSubs are great all terrain flip flops, even in wet, outdoor stony conditions.

<figure style=""margin: 0px;"">As with many great ideas, this one started small, in one of our favourite cafes just outside of Melbourne, Australia. We noticed a woman trying (with little success!) to fix her makeup using the front camera on her phone.<br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">
<p>Figuring that there must be an easier way to do this, and after doing a lot of research and speaking with many people we realised that this was a problem that a lot of people faced, so we set about finding a solution. And from there Mirra Mirra was born. An iPhone case with a slide out mirror and backing lights.</p>
<br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><h1><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">How it works</figure></h1>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p>Tiny prisms in the top half of the case catch the light from the LED torch on your phone and reflects it around the mirror using 2mm fibre optic tubing.</p>

@sylviajade - “So convenient for touch-ups when going out with friends, having a mirror with me at all times on my phone case is just so useful”


@lapetitenoob - “I love that it's right on your phone, let's be honest we all have our phones in our hands all the time”

@kimberelymoffit - “The product was easy to use, I really LOVED it, I would definitely use it for a night out with the girls”


@thatsotee - “Any girl would need that mirror, so definitely Mirra Mirra all the way”
How it all started
As with many great ideas, this one started small, in one of our favourite cafes just outside of Melbourne, Australia. We noticed a woman trying (with little success!) to fix her makeup using the front camera on her phone.
Figuring that there must be an easier way to do this, and after doing a lot of research and speaking with many people we realised that this was a problem that a lot of people faced, so we set about finding a solution. And from there Mirra Mirra was born. An iPhone case with a slide out mirror and backing lights.
How it works
Tiny prisms in the top half of the case catch the light from the LED torch on your phone and reflects it around the mirror using 2mm fibre optic tubing.

This allows the perfect amount of light to reflect onto users face for optimal use when fixing makeup or taking selfies.

manufacturing, packaging and shipping Stethies.

By backing our campaign, you'll be casting your vote to evolve hospitals, clinics, veterinarian and doctor's office beyond the
typical, boring stethoscope. You will be helping everyone in the medical field express
their individuality, show their team spirit, and even reduce patient anxiety in
adults and children. It's a win win for everyone!


Why This Campaign?
 
We're crowdsourcing capital on Indiegogo to launch or first product run.
If you are among those bold, design-oriented
individuals who crave the most innovative products available, you’ll love our
Stethie. If you think it's a compelling concept, but don't really need a stethoscope, considering buying one and donating it to a local children's hospital.  What better way to pay it forward?   Risks & Challenges 
This is our first Indiegogo campaign. We've
spent many hours researching and preparing for the project. However, as with
all new experiences we are ready to adapt and learn as we go. We feel the
feedback and input of backers will provide us with any adaptations or changes
needed though this process.
Any bumps we may hit along the way, you'll be
the first to know. We'll inform you with a current status, why it's happening
and how we're going to fix it. If at any point you have questions about our
risks or challenges, give us a shout - we're happy to talk it through with you.  


Other Ways You Can Help

 
Some people can't
contribute, and we totally understand. You'll win a place in our hearts if you share our campaign on Facebook or Twitter, or simply tell your
friends about our campaign to get people in motion. Because even if you can’t
pay – you can always pay it forward.  We're grateful for any efforts on our behalf.
Special Reviews
RN Fernando Hernandex-Firmin, Church Point, LA - April 2016""I had the honor of taking the Stethies for a test drive. The quality is great (very comparable to the most popular brand of stethoscope),  The designs are eye catching and actually get the patient to think about something else other than their visit at the office. The color is permanent and withstood cleaning with bleach, Lysol, alcohol, and Cabbie wipes commonly used in the hospital or office setting. Can rest assured that I will be a client...""Special ThanksI wouldn't be where I am today without Alexander Burdge at PSDI.  He has been my rock and my cheerleader from the initial conception of Stethies to now.  If anyone out there has a great idea, but doesn't know quite how to get started, give Alex a call.  I call him the miracle worker.  Also, a special thank  you to my children, Dusty, Tasha, & Kaitlyn for being a constant sounding board while working through all the prototypes and design changes. And for your unending support and encouragement.Thank you to my niece, Jennifer Moore and friends Terry & Fernando Fremin, and Pediatrician Dr. Mike Melancon, for being my professional consultants.

<div><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3></div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is TOUCHdown?</strong></p>
<p>TOUCHdown is a virtual wallet that is designed for privacy-minded people who want freedom from the “stuff” you have to carry for transactions, such as credit cards, debit cards and identification cards.</p>
<p>To use TOUCHdown, the user swipes their finger or touches down on an approved, secure fingerprint reader to open their virtual wallet and select a card to pay with. This can be done at any merchant location that uses TOUCHdown, including online merchants.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462945845/20160417_155230_qu2kwo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>How do I join TOUCHdown? What’s the process?</strong></p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign is a platform that will allow you to ""pre-sign up."" You can purchase a TOUCHdown membership now and then sign up later when we're at locations near you (and/or at online merchants).</p>
<p>Once we create our online membership platform, a new user can enroll online with TOUCHdown with a government issued ID for verification, a selfie, the credit/debit cards they normally use, and fingerprint samples. Once enrolled, the new TOUCHdown user can transact anywhere TOUCHdown is used.<br/></p>
<p><strong>How does it work? What can I do with it?</strong></p>
<p>To use TOUCHdown, the user swipes their finger or touches down on an approved fingerprint reader to open their virtual wallet and select a card to pay with. This can be done at any merchant location that uses TOUCHdown, including online merchants.</p>
<p>For now, TOUCHdown can be used for id verification and to make purchases.  We are also working on exciting possibilities for the future.</p>
<p><strong>I have a fingerprint that is really hard for readers to detect.  Oftentimes it doesn’t get scanned at all.  Does your system have provisions for that?</strong></p>
<p>There are some instances where a person’s fingerprint can’t be read. This can be caused by dry fingers, wet fingers, dirty fingers, a worn finger surface, poor finger placement, pressure on the sensor, or contaminants on the sensor surface—conditions that are common in real world use. These instances can be averted by using a multi-spectral reader. Multi spectral readers are the most accurate in capturing images and are the readers we recommend for commercial entities.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I buy a fingerprint reader to use for online purchases and to sign up?</strong></p>
<p>We are an authorized reseller of many different readers that can be used for TOUCHdown and we only carry readers that we feel are valuable in cost and performance. You can purchase a fingerprint reader (or several!) through our Indiegogo campaign. We have readers that work with Android devices (Lollipop) and PCs. We are compatible with and carry the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Digital Persona U are U 400 X</li>
<li>Authentic WBF readers</li>
<li>Broadcom</li>
<li>Cogent CS0200</li>

<li>Precise 200/250</li>
<li>Sagem 1300/1350</li>
<li>SecuGenWBF Readers</li>
<li>Suprema BioMini/Plus/S20</li>
<li>Validity WBF Readers</li>
<li>UPEK Swipe (Eikon)</li>
<li>UPEK TouchChip</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is there an interface or an app for connecting accounts?</strong></p>
<p>Within the TOUCHdown network, your fingerprint will be your key to any of the services or places on our network. We are exploring options for linking other accounts to your TOUCHdown account without affecting your privacy or security.</p>
<p><strong>How is it safe?</strong></p>
<p>TOUCHdown protects both data at rest and in transit. For security purposes, we won’t reveal our methods of protection. However, we assure you that we use industry best practices for security. Our ultimate standard is for our customers’ information to be secure and private.</p>
<p><strong>How is TOUCHdown different from other virtual wallets?</strong></p>
<p>The most notable difference between TOUCHdown and mobile wallets is that it doesn’t require a device.  Users truly have a way to pay without having to carry a phone, wallet or card.</p>
<p>An important difference from the merchant standpoint is <a href=""http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/authentication/biometric-technology-stomps-identity-theft-126"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/authentication/biometric-technology-stomps-identity-theft-126"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TOUCHdown offers more security from fraud</a>; fingerprint identification equipment at the POS deters fraudsters from attempting to make purchases. We also use multi-factor authentication at the POS so the merchant can identify their customer.</p>
<p><strong>Can it work with Google Wallet, Apple Pay or Paypal?</strong></p>
<p>No, Google Wallet and Apple Pay are both mobile wallets that use a smartphone (Android or iOs) for payments. PayPal, like TOUCHdown, is a digital wallet but requires user login for access, whereas the key to access your TOUCHdown account is your unique fingerprint.</p>
<p><strong>Does TOUCHdown insure against fraud?</strong></p>
<p>TOUCHdown is committed to fighting fraud and makes every effort to prevent fraud from occurring. However, because there are so many factors involved in fraud, we cannot reasonably insure against it.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I use it?</strong></p>
<p>TOUCHdown can potentially be used anywhere one might need an ID or wish to make a purchase.  We are always looking for new venues to carry TOUCHdown and welcome users’ suggestions.  We are currently setting up a rewards program for merchant referrals. Please follow us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TOUCHdown.ID"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/Touchdown_ID"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> for future details on our rewards program.</p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost? Is there a free trial?</strong></p>
<p>There is a one-time enrollment fee of $25 ($20 during our IndieGogo launch period) with a 3-month trial period. After that, there is a monthly fee of $10.</p>
<p><strong>I purchased the enrollment on your IndieGogo page. Do I have to sign up right away?</strong></p>
<p>No. We are building a network of merchants online and in your area. Want to be a part of the “excelling your life” movement?  Let us know where you’d like to use TOUCHdown. We will be offering a merchant referral rewards program.</p>
<p>If you purchase an enrollment on our Indiegogo campaign, your account won’t expire and you can sign up whenever you’re ready. Once we have enough online and in-store merchants using TOUCHdown, we will start allowing the sign-up process to happen. Think of our Indiegogo campaign as a “pre-sign-up.”</p>
<p><strong>I don’t have a credit or debit card. Can I still use TOUCHdown?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can still use the ID verification features. We are also working on adding other options for your TOUCHdown account in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What if I’m having a problem with my account? Do you have tech support?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are in the process of hiring a knowledgeable and friendly 24-7 team. In the meanwhile, if you have any questions about TOUCHdown or our policies, please <a href=""http://touchdown-id.com/contact-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact us here</a>.<br/></p>

transactions and customers.  Targeted ads make us feel like someone is watching what we do.




How It Works

1. Swipe or press down your fingerprint on a TOUCHdown merchant's fingerprint reader. Your name, date of birth and selfie will pop up on their TOUCHdown tablet.

2. Swipe the screen to the right and the merchant can then see your verified government ID.





3. Swipe the screen again to the right and you'll get to the payment page.




4. Press the drop-down menu and choose which card you'd like to use in your virtual wallet.



5. Press send. It's really that convenient!

    What We Need From You

We want to change the world by fighting identity fraud through our secure fingerprint-accessed wallet. We chose the crowdfunding platform so we can raise funds for our security measures and official release. Crowdfunding allows us to maintain our vision of a secure, privacy-oriented product that doesn't compromise the information our customers entrust with us. No unwanted advertising, no tracking, no information sold. 




Frequently Asked Questions

What is TOUCHdown?
TOUCHdown is a virtual wallet that is designed for privacy-minded people who want freedom from the “stuff” you have to carry for transactions, such as credit cards, debit cards and identification cards.
To use TOUCHdown, the user swipes their finger or touches down on an approved, secure fingerprint reader to open their virtual wallet and select a card to pay with. This can be done at any merchant location that uses TOUCHdown, including online merchants.



How do I join TOUCHdown? What’s the process?
Our Indiegogo campaign is a platform that will allow you to ""pre-sign up."" You can purchase a TOUCHdown membership now and then sign up later when we're at locations near you (and/or at online merchants).
Once we create our online membership platform, a new user can enroll online with TOUCHdown with a government issued ID for verification, a selfie, the credit/debit cards they normally use, and fingerprint samples. Once enrolled, the new TOUCHdown user can transact anywhere TOUCHdown is used.
How does it work? What can I do with it?
To use TOUCHdown, the user swipes their finger or touches down on an approved fingerprint reader to open their virtual wallet and select a card to pay with. This can be done at any merchant location that uses TOUCHdown, including online merchants.
For now, TOUCHdown can be used for id verification and to make purchases.  We are also working on exciting possibilities for the future.
I have a fingerprint that is really hard for readers to detect.  Oftentimes it doesn’t get scanned at all.  Does your system have provisions for that?
There are some instances where a person’s fingerprint can’t be read. This can be caused by dry fingers, wet fingers, dirty fingers, a worn finger surface, poor finger placement, pressure on the sensor, or contaminants on the sensor surface—conditions that are common in real world use. These instances can be averted by using a multi-spectral reader. Multi spectral readers are the most accurate in capturing images and are the readers we recommend for commercial entities.
Where can I buy a fingerprint reader to use for online purchases and to sign up?
We are an authorized reseller of many different readers that can be used for TOUCHdown and we only carry readers that we feel are valuable in cost and performance. You can purchase a fingerprint reader (or several!) through our Indiegogo campaign. We have readers that work with Android devices (Lollipop) and PCs. We are compatible with and carry the following:

Digital Persona U are U 400 X
Authentic WBF readers
Broadcom
Cogent CS0200
Crossmatch verifier 300 USB
Digent FD1000
Futronic FS80/FS88
Integrated Biometrics
Identix DFR500
Identix DFR500FB
Koehlke
Lumidigm
Next Biometrics NB-1010 U
Precise 200/250
Sagem 1300/1350
SecuGenWBF Readers
Suprema BioMini/Plus/S20
Validity WBF Readers
UPEK Swipe (Eikon)
UPEK TouchChip

Is there an interface or an app for connecting accounts?
Within the TOUCHdown network, your fingerprint will be your key to any of the services or places on our network. We are exploring options for linking other accounts to your TOUCHdown account without affecting your privacy or security.
How is it safe?
TOUCHdown protects both data at rest and in transit. For security purposes, we won’t reveal our methods of protection. However, we assure you that we use industry best practices for security. Our ultimate standard is for our customers’ information to be secure and private.
How is TOUCHdown different from other virtual wallets?
The most notable difference between TOUCHdown and mobile wallets is that it doesn’t require a device.  Users truly have a way to pay without having to carry a phone, wallet or card.
An important difference from the merchant standpoint is TOUCHdown offers more security from fraud; fingerprint identification equipment at the POS deters fraudsters from attempting to make purchases. We also use multi-factor authentication at the POS so the merchant can identify their customer.
Can it work with Google Wallet, Apple Pay or Paypal?
No, Google Wallet and Apple Pay are both mobile wallets that use a smartphone (Android or iOs) for payments. PayPal, like TOUCHdown, is a digital wallet but requires user login for access, whereas the key to access your TOUCHdown account is your unique fingerprint.
Does TOUCHdown insure against fraud?
TOUCHdown is committed to fighting fraud and makes every effort to prevent fraud from occurring. However, because there are so many factors involved in fraud, we cannot reasonably insure against it.
Where can I use it?
TOUCHdown can potentially be used anywhere one might need an ID or wish to make a purchase.  We are always looking for new venues to carry TOUCHdown and welcome users’ suggestions.  We are currently setting up a rewards program for merchant referrals. Please follow us on Facebook or Twitter for future details on our rewards program.


How much does it cost? Is there a free trial?
There is a one-time enrollment fee of $25 ($20 during our IndieGogo launch period) with a 3-month trial period. After that, there is a monthly fee of $10.
I purchased the enrollment on your IndieGogo page. Do I have to sign up right away?
No. We are building a network of merchants online and in your area. Want to be a part of the “excelling your life” movement?  Let us know where you’d like to use TOUCHdown. We will be offering a merchant referral rewards program.
If you purchase an enrollment on our Indiegogo campaign, your account won’t expire and you can sign up whenever you’re ready. Once we have enough online and in-store merchants using TOUCHdown, we will start allowing the sign-up process to happen. Think of our Indiegogo campaign as a “pre-sign-up.”
I don’t have a credit or debit card. Can I still use TOUCHdown?
Yes, you can still use the ID verification features. We are also working on adding other options for your TOUCHdown account in the future.
What if I’m having a problem with my account? Do you have tech support?
Yes, we are in the process of hiring a knowledgeable and friendly 24-7 team. In the meanwhile, if you have any questions about TOUCHdown or our policies, please contact us here.

</div></div>","I am going to intern for WIL Uganda - a small grassroots organisation working to empower and educate women and girls in rural Uganda.

The problems women and girls are facing in Uganda:
Due to cultural norms with women expected to be home-makers, and the prevalence of teen pregnancies, teen marriages, and forced marriages in Uganda (particularly in the rural areas), girls are often denied the basic right to education. This prevents them from being actively involved in their communities and even from being able to provide for themselves and their families.

Statistics show that if every woman were to finish secondary school there would be fewer child deaths, less malnutrition, more educated children, and stronger economies.
Women are key in the development of their communities as a whole; not educating women means losing the potential of many valuable society members, which affects everyone.

What does WIL Uganda do to help?
WIL Uganda works with education as the key to solving many of the problems faced by girls and communities in rural Uganda. The education programmes cover literacy, business skills, leadership, sexual reproductive health, rights and advocacy among others. This is with the hope of empowering and protecting girls and giving them the chance to become future leaders, and active in the development of their communities.
Creating sustainable incomes
Recently WIL Uganda began running a Crafts Programme which teaches women and girls to make traditional hand crafted jewellery which they can sell in local markets or online as individuals or as part of a group. This is the programme which I will be mostly involved with during my time in Busembatia. 
The programme gives the women practical and entrepreneurial skills and enables them to create a sustainable income, giving them greater independence and the ability to provide for their families.One woman, Irene, has been able to use the money that she made from the  BaNyabo jewellery sales to send her daughter to school. This demonstrates the project's far-reaching potential for positive impact.

During my time with WIL Uganda I will be helping to teach the ladies to make the crafts and developing the programme as a whole in order to bring them further successes and leave them with valuable life skills.



Why I need your help


I need to raise £300 to cover some of my in-country expenses provided by WIL Uganda, and obviously to continue and expand the amazing work done by the organisation. The more I can raise above my target, the more can go directly into developing projects. 



Any donations, however small, are greatly appreciated!

<p>Slow Fashion is a
movement that encompasses sustainable apparel and provides a broader view,
involving consumer awareness of the whole process of design to production,
through to use and then re-use. Its growth hinges on a shifting of heart and
attitude towards the way we consume clothing. From an attitude of carelessness,
ignorance and waste to one of stewardship, intention and pleasure in simple,
valuable everyday experiences. This shift will take time and effort, but
through steady commitment on the part of designer-makers and educators,
awareness will grow.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>About Meraki KL</b></h3>
<p>Based in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, Meraki KL is a womenswear label aiming to inspire and give
back to the environment and community. Our mission is to present consumers with
designs that are fashionable, ethically produced, and spread
awareness on the Slow Fashion movement across Southeast Asia, starting with
our home country. We are also committed in helping small or big charities raise
funds. RM10 from each piece we produce will be donated to the selected
beneficiary which changes every collection.</p>
<p>At Meraki KL, we
work with ONLY ethical factories. From our fabric supplier and even our
tailors. All our production and branding materials are made locally, and none
are outsourced to other countries. The two people behind Meraki KL, co-owners
Hanis and Arisha, will handle all designing, fabric hunting and delivery of
garments to customers.</p>

<p>For many, “fast
fashion” is the only type of fashion they know. When you think “fast fashion”,
you can think disposable, short-lived and cheap; seasonal change, image
glorification, and mass marketing; mass production, quantity, standardization
and identical product; mediocre quality, lack of meaning and value,
international acceptance and global homogenization. While the conditions for
garment workers in Southeast Asia may not exactly mirror those in Bangladesh,
many similar issues exist. Especially in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia
which also have large-scale garment production. </p>
<p>Public awareness of
ethical fashion issues is still in its infancy in Malaysia. Most producers,
designers, and consumers have not even been exposed to the idea of questioning
who made their clothes and under what conditions. When they are, there is a
resigned view that accounting for sustainability in their supply chains will
make their products commercially unattractive. Consumers here are not curious
about who makes their clothing, how much they are being paid and in what
condition these people have to work in. It is time to make them curious, help them see
and realise what goes on in the back room, and make a change. Our hope is that
people will be so enamored with the beauty and virtue of Slow Fashion’s
principles and product that they will forget about the less satisfying
alternative of fast fashion.<br/><br/></p>

When you're meeting someone, the first thing they learn about you is what you look like. We at Lureaux understand that people tend to make assumptions about you because of what you wear. We designed our shoes to enable people to convey the right message by simply wearing our shoes. Many people wear the same boring shoes and miss the opportunity to say: ""<i>Hi there, I am not mediocre!</i>"". Don't be trapped in mediocrity. Dare to be different, wear Lureaux Shoes! <br/></p><p></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Idea and Inspiration<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">About one year ago I, Bas, was looking for a unique dress shoe. These shoes were available to some extent, but they were really expensive. In my opinion it shouldn’t be expensive to express yourself through the things you wear. This was the day that I got the idea to create a unique dress shoe that is affordable for everyone. Subsequently, I approached an old friend, Femke, because I knew she was the right designer to work with. Femke is also very in to fashion, something we at Lureaux consider as important as well. She was very enthusiastic and had a lot of inspiration. She came with dozens of sketches and ideas. Besides drawing and designing, Femke loves to travel to foreign countries which is also an important source of inspiration. </span></p><p><b>Lureaux Shoes</b><br/>Our designs range from special to extraordinary and everything in between. Lureaux Shoes contain high quality materials. The shoes are manufactured in an environment with high ethical working standards. This was tested by third-parties as well as by ourselves. The high quality of the materials make it possible to wear the shoes on a daily base. Most designer shoes are very expensive. Besides designing awesome shoes, our goal was to make our collection affordable for everyone. This also makes the shoe ideal to wear to a job interview or party.</p><b>Our Models<br/><div style=""text-align: center;""><b>Ostrich</b></div></b><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464874731/WhatsApp-Image-20160530_1_onikzc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: center;"">Ostrich Cognac<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464874743/WhatsApp-Image-20160530_bpfzov.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: center;"">Army Green<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464874949/WhatsApp-Image-20160530_5_zz5ob3.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: center;""><br/>Army Blue<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464874955/WhatsApp-Image-20160530_3_qtcahz.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p><b><div style=""text-align: center;"">

First of all, we had to design models, make a promo video, source materials, look for partners and so on. At this point, we succesfully completed our Kickstarter campaign. For this, we improved the quality of the shoes and also had to design and manufacture shoeboxes for example.  </p><p>We structured the initial proces of this project as follows. First, we started sketching and designing. We took a lot of time for this stage, since this will determine our brand image.  Only the best designs were selected to make sample shoes from. We composed a shortlist of 10 manufacturers that were recommended by different trade unions and close contacts in this industry and asked the manufacturers to produce the samples based on our designs. We ranked the suppliers on different criteria that were set in advance such as quality of the materials used, service, support, timely delivery and ethical work environment. The manufacturer that ranked the highest on all criteria was selected. This manufacturer became our partner and has already produced a high quality batch of shoes for our Kickstarter backers.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464932684/team-3_nieuw_hilba3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why Indiegogo? </b><br/>After finishing a very succesful <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2038669153/lureaux-shoes-unique-comfortable-and-affordable-dr/description"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kickstarter Campaign</a>, it is  time to give you and the Indiegogo community an opportunity to get a fresh pair of Lureaux Shoes. We at Lureaux really love crowdfunding. In this way, we get loads of feedback. We can test how popular each design is, what we need to improve and so on. This information reduces the risk of ending up with stock that will not be sold. In return, we reward you with a discount on the newest Lureaux Shoes. The Indiegogo community could give us a boost to build a unique brand. If our goal is reached, we are able to build a stock level of Lureaux Shoes that allows us to fulfill orders of our almost finished online shop. This online shop is now under construction and is expected to go live in July. The amount of funding will be used to cover manufacturing and shipping cost of the new batch. Of course, we won't be able to cover our own fee and the design costs for example. But backing us means that you give us an opportunity to grow and hopefully in this way we can cover all costs in the future. If you back us, we will reward you with attractive discounts and the possibility to stand out by wearing Lureaux Shoes.

<b>Risks and Challenges</b><br/>The risk for this project, if any, is very low. To illustrate this: we already wear the shoes ourselves. Moreover, we succesfully ran a campaign on Kickstarter and managed to solve the corresponding logistical challenges.</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The only risk, if any, would be that you order a size that slightly deviates from your actual size. To solve this, we are currently looking for ways to set up an international reverse logistics network that allows us to accept reverse logistics from anywhere in the world. Untill then, please contact us when it turns out that you ordered a size that doesn't fit.In this way, we can help you to solve this issue. Another risk is that we cannot deliver on the actual delivery date due to unforeseen circumstances. We emphasize that we already managed to solve the logistical challenges and we expect to deliver the shoes on (or even before) the promised delivery date. However, if the delivery date will be postponed we will directly inform our backers. Also, if it is possible to deliver the shoes before the planned delivery date, we will ask whether it is preferred to have the shoes delivered earlier. Moreover, every update that might be interesting for our backers will be shared.

<b>It's time to BACK US</b><br/>First of all, thank you for your time. We hope that you will you back us by pre-ordering one or more pairs of Lureaux Shoes. Please feel free to contact us at <a href=""mailto:info@lureaux.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@lureaux.com</a> if  you have further questions. Lastly, if you can't back us, you can still help us by sharing our project page :) <br/></span></div></div>","Hi Indiegogo,Even if we say they don't, first impressions matter! When you're meeting someone, the first thing they learn about you is what you look like. We at Lureaux understand that people tend to make assumptions about you because of what you wear. We designed our shoes to enable people to convey the right message by simply wearing our shoes. Many people wear the same boring shoes and miss the opportunity to say: ""Hi there, I am not mediocre!"". Don't be trapped in mediocrity. Dare to be different, wear Lureaux Shoes! Idea and InspirationAbout one year ago I, Bas, was looking for a unique dress shoe. These shoes were available to some extent, but they were really expensive. In my opinion it shouldn’t be expensive to express yourself through the things you wear. This was the day that I got the idea to create a unique dress shoe that is affordable for everyone. Subsequently, I approached an old friend, Femke, because I knew she was the right designer to work with. Femke is also very in to fashion, something we at Lureaux consider as important as well. She was very enthusiastic and had a lot of inspiration. She came with dozens of sketches and ideas. Besides drawing and designing, Femke loves to travel to foreign countries which is also an important source of inspiration. Lureaux ShoesOur designs range from special to extraordinary and everything in between. Lureaux Shoes contain high quality materials. The shoes are manufactured in an environment with high ethical working standards. This was tested by third-parties as well as by ourselves. The high quality of the materials make it possible to wear the shoes on a daily base. Most designer shoes are very expensive. Besides designing awesome shoes, our goal was to make our collection affordable for everyone. This also makes the shoe ideal to wear to a job interview or party.Our ModelsOstrichOstrich CognacArmy GreenArmy Blue

Paint Light BlueStyle BlackFunkPre-IndiegogoIt took a lot of  time and resources for our team to come to this point. First of all, we had to design models, make a promo video, source materials, look for partners and so on. At this point, we succesfully completed our Kickstarter campaign. For this, we improved the quality of the shoes and also had to design and manufacture shoeboxes for example.  We structured the initial proces of this project as follows. First, we started sketching and designing. We took a lot of time for this stage, since this will determine our brand image.  Only the best designs were selected to make sample shoes from. We composed a shortlist of 10 manufacturers that were recommended by different trade unions and close contacts in this industry and asked the manufacturers to produce the samples based on our designs. We ranked the suppliers on different criteria that were set in advance such as quality of the materials used, service, support, timely delivery and ethical work environment. The manufacturer that ranked the highest on all criteria was selected. This manufacturer became our partner and has already produced a high quality batch of shoes for our Kickstarter backers.Why Indiegogo? After finishing a very succesful Kickstarter Campaign, it is  time to give you and the Indiegogo community an opportunity to get a fresh pair of Lureaux Shoes. We at Lureaux really love crowdfunding. In this way, we get loads of feedback. We can test how popular each design is, what we need to improve and so on. This information reduces the risk of ending up with stock that will not be sold. In return, we reward you with a discount on the newest Lureaux Shoes. The Indiegogo community could give us a boost to build a unique brand. If our goal is reached, we are able to build a stock level of Lureaux Shoes that allows us to fulfill orders of our almost finished online shop. This online shop is now under construction and is expected to go live in July. The amount of funding will be used to cover manufacturing and shipping cost of the new batch. Of course, we won't be able to cover our own fee and the design costs for example. But backing us means that you give us an opportunity to grow and hopefully in this way we can cover all costs in the future. If you back us, we will reward you with attractive discounts and the possibility to stand out by wearing Lureaux Shoes. For a more detailed description of the rewards, please read the text below.Rewards As explained above, we reward our backers with attractive discounts. The earlier you back us, the more money you save. We have all sort of deals for you, so pick the one that you like! Do you want only one pair of shoes? Then we have the following deals for you:Do you want two pairs of Lureaux Shoes? Then we have the following deals for you:Do you want three pairs of Lureaux Shoes? Then we have the following deals for you:TimelineOur Campaign runs 40 days and as explained above, the earlier you back us, the more discount you get! See the timeline below to see when what to expect when in the coming period.
Post-IndiegogoAfter our goal is reached and the campaign has ended, we will send you a survey to ask your size(s) and preferred model(s). Also, we will send you more interesting information about our models. This allows you to choose your preferred size and model(s). You can choose any model that you've seen on this page (and possibly more). After you completed the survey, we will start to manufacture your shoes as soon as possible. 
Size ChartWe use European sizes, please take a look at the size chart below and choose your size.

Risks and ChallengesThe risk for this project, if any, is very low. To illustrate this: we already wear the shoes ourselves. Moreover, we succesfully ran a campaign on Kickstarter and managed to solve the corresponding logistical challenges.
The only risk, if any, would be that you order a size that slightly deviates from your actual size. To solve this, we are currently looking for ways to set up an international reverse logistics network that allows us to accept reverse logistics from anywhere in the world. Untill then, please contact us when it turns out that you ordered a size that doesn't fit.In this way, we can help you to solve this issue. Another risk is that we cannot deliver on the actual delivery date due to unforeseen circumstances. We emphasize that we already managed to solve the logistical challenges and we expect to deliver the shoes on (or even before) the promised delivery date. However, if the delivery date will be postponed we will directly inform our backers. Also, if it is possible to deliver the shoes before the planned delivery date, we will ask whether it is preferred to have the shoes delivered earlier. Moreover, every update that might be interesting for our backers will be shared. Lastly, we promise that we will do everything to meet and exceed your expectation!

It drew its substance from the idiot and was otherwise unaware of him.”…....................................................................................................................“L'amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle”Dante, Paradiso canto XXXIIIEvelin vive con la sorella Alice e il padre in una casa isolata lungo il fiume.Da quando la loro madre se ne è andata nessuno ha più varcato il cancello della proprietà.Nessuno è più entrato o uscito.I tre vivono in un mondo grigio e privo di luce, un mondo dove ogni segnale di vita deve essere soppresso ed inibito.La vita provoca dolore, i legami e gli affetti provocano dolore e questo male deve essere evitato.Ma Evelin ora sente dentro di se nascere qualcosa di nuovo che non riesce a scacciare.Il suo corpo si è svegliato e non ha più intenzione di tornare a dormire.La primavera sta sbocciando e un giovane chiamato da tutti l'idiota ha deciso di lasciare la sua terra per incontrare una donna incontrata in sogno.La storia è liberamente tratta dal libro “ Più che Umano” di Theodore Sturgeon“ L’idiota viveva in un mondo nero e grigio,punteggiato dai lampi bianchi della fame e dalfremito della paura.Come un nocciolo in una pesca o un tuorlo in unuovo, portava dentro un’altra cosa.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES </strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HOW IN THE WORLD WILL YOU DONATE 100 % OF PROFITS?</strong></p>
<p>     Transparency is really important to us. Each year we will be releasing our financial information so everyone can follow the money. If you have any questions, please ask! </p>
<p><i>Profit :</i> <i>a financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned and the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing something.</i></p>
<p>  + Total sales </p>
<p>        - the cost of making the apparel </p>
<p>       - operational overhead (marketing, back stock, website maintenance, wages, etc) </p>
<p>   = Total Profits</p>
<p>The Profits are what we donate to charity.  Not 1% or 5%.   100%.   Acoustic is a registered non-profit corporation -  we are truly committed to donating all of our profits for the benefit of earth &amp; society.  </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FLEXIBILITY: WHAT IF THE GOAL IS NOT REACHED? </strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Even with a single contributor, we will still be able get you the goods!  But the closer we get to the goal, the more we can do for the charity programs right off the bat. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489098640/n4q5jszo5squbmosayxb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks Part A:  Summer/Fall Collection</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We’ve already overcome the challenge of <strong>crafting high quality goods at an affordable price, without exploiting people or the environment.   </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have the samples in hand and the materials, facility, and distribution are in place to produce the first collection.   </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will be creating a limited run of the designs, based on backer and shop orders. This minimizes initial costs and allows us to focus on producing only the most desired pieces. Upon completion of this campaign we will send a form to each backer that would like to order from the first collection.     </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks Part B: Winter/Spring Collection: Samples &amp; Lookbook</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Sample creation is challenging.  But we'll be working with experienced fashion pattern makers to create simple, stunning, comfortable, and durable outerwear.    We’ve sourced the high quality eco friendly materials for each piece and have the production facility ready to create the line.   </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Once the samples and look book are finalized, we’ll share with shops, take orders, and produce the Winter/Spring 18’ collection. The pieces will then be made available on the Acoustic web store. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE FOUNDERS </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“In our travels we kept finding the same issues plaguing each place we visited.  We did what we could to help, but wanted to <strong>find a way to have a bigger impact</strong>. We started imagining what would happen if an outdoor apparel company was built to better the world, rather than just profit from it.   We called it Acoustic.  Our original plan was to create an apparel collective that donated all proceeds to existing charity organizations.  But we discovered  1. There were no organizations addressing the work that needed to be done in the areas we traveled.    2. Most other ‘charity’ organizations we considered donating to pay excessive salaries to the top administration. We set out to remedy that: we formed both Acoustic (non-profit apparel collective) and The Acoustic Initiative (501c3 charity organization).  That way we could ensure the funds would have maximum impact.  We are happy to consider any charity organization as a recipient of Acoustic profits - provided the administrative overhead is minimal.”   Gary Lynn &amp; Danielle Ciminero  </p>

2. Once this campaign has ended we'll send you a form - you can select anything available in the Acoustic webstore.  If you choose egift card - you can also use it on any future Acoustic collections.   
3. We create the Summer/Fall collection and ship you the goods! (est. July 2017)
4.  We create the 2018 samples & lookbook, take orders from shops and create the Winter /Spring 18 Collection.  The pieces will then be made available in the webstore! 
100% of Profits are Donated.  Really? 
Yes! We’re going all in. Here is where the money goes: 
1. The charity programs:  To protect the ocean and environment, rescue animals,  end poverty in a way that is environmentally sustainable, and enrich humanity.  You can learn more about the charity programs or donate directly to them 
2.  The ambassador program: to further athletic, artistic and creative pursuits of inspiring individuals who give everything to their calling.  Ambassadors will play an integral role in charity programs while advocating and inspiring positive change worldwide.  
  Buyers will be able to choose which program receives funding at checkout.  When you pre-order apparel here, you will be able to choose which program on the form we send you once the campaign ends.  

THE APPAREL
ECO-FRIENDLY:  Because what is the point of outer wear that ruins the outer world?   Let’s keep earth incredible & explorable.  Acoustic apparel will be crafted with the finest environmentally conscious fabrics: organic cotton, bamboo blend, tencel, hemp and recycled poly. We use only Low impact dyes and water based inks.  Many of the pieces will be brought to life using wind and solar power. Most people wouldn’t dump a barrel of toxic waste into the waters of their local beach, but the pollution resulting from non-organic cotton and other made made fibers do just that worldwide.  
ETHICALLY SOURCED: To honor the people who bring our ideas and designs to life. We refuse to support exploitative practices and aim to eliminate sweatshops, child labor and forced labor.  We believe in fair working conditions and uplifting people in every way possible.  
Ridiculously Soft and Comfortable:  Our mission is to craft adventure apparel that is lightweight and luxurious. 


THE PLAN   
PART A 
$26,000 Summer/Fall  Product creation 
          Men's and Women's: Tees, Tops, Hoodies, Hats, Beanies, Stickers, Patches 
$4,000 web development, product photography and marketing 
Once produced, the perk products will be shipped to backers, the remaining products will be available for purchase on the web store as well as in local surf shops and boutiques across the U.S. 
All profits from sales will be donated to the charity programs and ambassador fund. (Buyer will be able to choose which at checkout - backers will be able to choose which on the form sent at the end of this campaign!)  
PART B
$25,000 Winter/Spring '18 collection sample creation & production   
      Men’s and Women’s: long sleeve tops, board shorts, bikinis, yoga pants, comfy shorts, sundresses, and coats.  These will be created by experienced fashion designers. The funds go to the design and creation of the samples as well as a small run production of the line. 
$5,000 product photography, look book creation, web store development, and marketing
(The remaining funds cover the 5% platform fee and 2.9% card processing fee) 

Simple. Comfortable. Earth Friendly. Ethically Sourced. 100% of profits for good.

RISKS & CHALLENGES 
HOW IN THE WORLD WILL YOU DONATE 100 % OF PROFITS?
     Transparency is really important to us. Each year we will be releasing our financial information so everyone can follow the money. If you have any questions, please ask! 
Profit : a financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned and the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing something.
  + Total sales 
        - the cost of making the apparel 
       - operational overhead (marketing, back stock, website maintenance, wages, etc) 
   = Total Profits
The Profits are what we donate to charity.  Not 1% or 5%.   100%.   Acoustic is a registered non-profit corporation -  we are truly committed to donating all of our profits for the benefit of earth & society.  
FLEXIBILITY: WHAT IF THE GOAL IS NOT REACHED? 
Even with a single contributor, we will still be able get you the goods!  But the closer we get to the goal, the more we can do for the charity programs right off the bat. 

Risks Part A:  Summer/Fall Collection
We’ve already overcome the challenge of crafting high quality goods at an affordable price, without exploiting people or the environment.   
We have the samples in hand and the materials, facility, and distribution are in place to produce the first collection.   
We will be creating a limited run of the designs, based on backer and shop orders. This minimizes initial costs and allows us to focus on producing only the most desired pieces. Upon completion of this campaign we will send a form to each backer that would like to order from the first collection.     
Risks Part B: Winter/Spring Collection: Samples & Lookbook
Sample creation is challenging.  But we'll be working with experienced fashion pattern makers to create simple, stunning, comfortable, and durable outerwear.    We’ve sourced the high quality eco friendly materials for each piece and have the production facility ready to create the line.   
Once the samples and look book are finalized, we’ll share with shops, take orders, and produce the Winter/Spring 18’ collection. The pieces will then be made available on the Acoustic web store. 




 
THE FOUNDERS 
“In our travels we kept finding the same issues plaguing each place we visited.  We did what we could to help, but wanted to find a way to have a bigger impact. We started imagining what would happen if an outdoor apparel company was built to better the world, rather than just profit from it.   We called it Acoustic.  Our original plan was to create an apparel collective that donated all proceeds to existing charity organizations.  But we discovered  1. There were no organizations addressing the work that needed to be done in the areas we traveled.    2. Most other ‘charity’ organizations we considered donating to pay excessive salaries to the top administration. We set out to remedy that: we formed both Acoustic (non-profit apparel collective) and The Acoustic Initiative (501c3 charity organization).  That way we could ensure the funds would have maximum impact.  We are happy to consider any charity organization as a recipient of Acoustic profits - provided the administrative overhead is minimal.”   Gary Lynn & Danielle Ciminero

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Kylie Jane, and I'm a South African gal currently living in Shanghai. I've always been passionate about creating and I've always wanted to create something unique to make others happier and healthier.  </p>
<p>Naturally Kjane is my passion project that I started towards the end of last year. It's an athleisure lifestyle brand focused on making women feel confident and comfortable, daily. I want to create a Naturally Kjane Kit with a cute yet sophisticated tote bag, sports bra, and leggings, that women can easily carry around with them, and use whether they're heading to gym, picking kids up from school or running errands. Naturally Kjane is all about giving women the choice to wear high quality products that are as unique as they are, comfortable and effortless to wear - like a second skin. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to raise enough funding to place the first order for 50 Naturally Kjane Kits! 50 is the minimum factory order requirement. This includes 50 marble sports bras and 50 black leggings packaged in 50 hand-crafted tote bags. Once these 50 kits are ready to go, Naturally Kjane will not only be able to reach women living here in Shanghai, but also in South Africa, and beyond.</p>
<p>What the 3 grand will help achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1 500 will go towards the first order of 50 sports bras, and 50 leggings</li>
<li>$500 will go towards 50 hand-crafted, customised tote bags </li>
<li>$1 000 will go towards marketing - content creation and advertising </li>
</ul>
<p>If the funding goal is not reached, the money that is raised will go towards creating and marketing the tote bags alone, which will help raise funds towards the manufacturing of the sports bras and leggings. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Naturally Kjane is all about enhancing, and celebrating your body, as it is. Whether you're a complete yogi, or you prefer walking, or coffee catchups with friends, we get you. We want women to have the choice to feel comfortable, and still look gorgeous. </p>
<p>Skinny is no longer the goal - nourishing and caring for your body is, which is vital in our fast-paced, busy lifestyles. Self-care and self-love are becoming increasingly important, and women are making more time for themselves and choosing health. We understand this, and support this. </p>
<p>What Naturally Kjane stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort - giving woman a beautiful and super comfortable second skin to enhance their own</li>
<li>Effortlessness</li>
<li>Confidence </li>
<li>Individuality </li>
<li>High quality fabrics, design and products </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are very few risks involved in this project! The greatest challenge is the marketing of the product, and making sure it reaches the right audience who will want to try it and buy it, as opposed to buying the current activewear out there. </p>
<p>I am a Digital Marketer, specialising in Social Media Marketing, so I'll be able to successfully market and distribute my product using e-commerce platforms, including my own blog, Amazon, Etsy, Instagram and Facebook. I will execute a strong marketing campaign, specifically using social media, to reach young females looking for effortless, beautiful, comfortable athleisure that will make them feel more confident. </p>

<p>Why? It will make it easier to see and find your items, and besides, it looks fabulous. </p>
<p><strong>Backpack straps: </strong>These will be fixed on with dog clips for ease of use, instead of a thread through in the top D-ring as featured in the video. This will make it easier to use and stabilise</p>

The pictures of our Boston Convertible here is a prototype. Though the main form of the bag will remain the same, we plan to make it even better with a few extra changes. 
Lining: Our video features our prototype bag with a plain black lining. Though this looks great already, we will be replacing this with a black & white pin stripe lining instead.
Why? It will make it easier to see and find your items, and besides, it looks fabulous. 
Backpack straps: These will be fixed on with dog clips for ease of use, instead of a thread through in the top D-ring as featured in the video. This will make it easier to use and stabilise

<h3><i>ARI500 seeks to redefine this generation of ""fast fashion"".</i></h3>
<p>Under the creative direction of Ari Duhaney, ARI500 will produce a collection manufactured by US based garment factories right in NYC. Working with these factories cuts carbon emissions that are a result of shipping to and from countries like India and China, where majority of clothing is outsourced today. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Given the circumstances of our global environment today, it is vital that fashion companies begin to rethink their ethical standards and general ethos. Brands like Zara, H&amp;M, and Forever 21 outsource clothing in China and Bangladesh, where majority of workers are underpaid and work in dangerous conditions. The name of their game is to produce as much product as possible as fast as possible, and with that comes the issue of waste disposal. Regulations overseas are not as strict as in the states and Europe, leading to environmental crisis in areas surrounding these factories. Once these goods, are in the states, what doesn't get sold, gets thrown away and is likely to end up in a landfill. Majority of these clothes are made from synthetics (polyester, lycra, spandex) that <i>do not</i> biodegrade. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 84 percent of unwanted clothes in the United States in 2012 went into either a landfill or an incinerator. Combatting this issue begins with small businesses like ARI500 committing to sustainable practices by working domestically and sourcing biodegradable materials. </p>

Under the creative direction of Ari Duhaney, ARI500 will produce a collection manufactured by US based garment factories right in NYC. Working with these factories cuts carbon emissions that are a result of shipping to and from countries like India and China, where majority of clothing is outsourced today.

The Impact
Given the circumstances of our global environment today, it is vital that fashion companies begin to rethink their ethical standards and general ethos. Brands like Zara, H&M, and Forever 21 outsource clothing in China and Bangladesh, where majority of workers are underpaid and work in dangerous conditions. The name of their game is to produce as much product as possible as fast as possible, and with that comes the issue of waste disposal. Regulations overseas are not as strict as in the states and Europe, leading to environmental crisis in areas surrounding these factories. Once these goods, are in the states, what doesn't get sold, gets thrown away and is likely to end up in a landfill. Majority of these clothes are made from synthetics (polyester, lycra, spandex) that do not biodegrade. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 84 percent of unwanted clothes in the United States in 2012 went into either a landfill or an incinerator. Combatting this issue begins with small businesses like ARI500 committing to sustainable practices by working domestically and sourcing biodegradable materials.

The Indian inspiration for our garments, accessories and table linens is subtle, interpreted—not copied—to blend into any lifestyle.</p><p>We start with organic cotton grown in India—a blank canvas for the artisans’ craft. Print designs are sketched, then translated into hand-carved hardwood blocks, one for each color in the print. Block carving is painstaking work. </p><p>Low impact, AZO free pigment dyes are mixed and fabric is stretched on specially built tables. The printer goes to work, pressing the block into the cotton time and again. The pattern undulates across the fabric with subtle variations caused by the varying pressure of the artisan’s hand. This process will be repeated for every color in the design—as many as six in some patterns.</p><p>In between application of each element of the design, the fabric is rinsed, line-dried, rinsed again, hung to dry, then rinsed once more. The rinse water becomes laden with dye and fiber. Both have to be filtered so that the water can be reused several times before being released safely as wastewater.</p><p>The traditional process of hand block printing on textiles, with rich natural colors, has been practiced in Rajasthan for around 500 years.  Block printing was introduced to the Jaipur region of Rajasthan by the Chhipa community.  This community was originally located in Bagru Village, an area now famous for its vegetable dye and mud resist (dabu) block prints.  The art of block printing has been passed down for generations within families and communities and has branched out in recent decades to other regions such as Sanganer, just South of Jaipur.  In traditional Bagru style block printing, the ‘recipes’ for the traditional plant-based dyes are developed within each family and kept alive from generation to generation.  The colors are dependent on the quality of the plants, the water and skill and knowledge of the printing masters.  In more recent forms of block printing, such as those practiced in Sanganer, colors are mixed using AZO free pigment dyes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522545241/ir4f7qhekrfxll9oeyfo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522544983/dtqgu44mlktinjxvrpg7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>STEP 1: Block Carving</strong></p><p>A print starts with the design, drawn on paper and carved into the Sheesham wood block.  Designs are meticulously carved by hand into the blocks which are approximately 18-25 cm across.  The physical block is the design for a single repeat which is then stamped in rows across the fabric.  Each color in the design is carved into a separate block.  Depending on the colors in the design, the ground color block or 'gud' or the outline block or 'rekh', (which is the most intricate) and usually stamped first; it is typically the outline for a floral or lattice type design.  Next comes the fill block or 'datta'.  Block carving is in itself an art requiring years of apprenticeship to gain mastery and is done entirely by hand.  </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522545058/c5xurepzba6tzkayrnmq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>STEP 2: Color Mixing-Preparing the Dyes</strong></p><p>Once the blocks are carved, the master printer prepares the colors which will be used in printing.  The colors are then poured into wooden trays and the blocks stamped in the color each time, then stamped onto the fabric to form the repeat pattern.  The colors shown are AZO free, low-impact pigment dyes which are used in Sanganer printing.</p><p>For each new design, we do a color check and test out new color combinations.  We use Pantone  reference codes for color matching.  In the photos, our master printer, Ghanshyam Ji is working with our team to develop a series of new colorways with our new collection.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522623616/bxpvhlxmqig3f1eey6is.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>STEP 3: Printing Process</strong></p><p>Each color pattern is stamped individually onto the fabric; the process takes skill and time, as the pattern must be stamped repeatedly across the fabric, color by color. The slight human irregularities — inevitable in handwork — create the artistic effect emblematic of block prints.  The final outcome of this intricate labor is a timeless beauty, and every garment made from this fabric is unique.</p><p>The printing master must carefully align each block as he prints, using the ‘guide’ carved on the left edge of the block as his marker.  Each printer has a slightly different style which is considered his ‘signature’ look.  The printing master must then follow the same pattern of aligning the blocks with each color layered on to the design.  The subtle gaps and overlaps are a beautiful reminder of the hand work and give block printing it’s iconic look.  All prints exemplify this aesthetic and have a subtle pattern of light/dark across the design.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Who We Are -   Mehera Shaw, LLC</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522545440/udgttgvzatwflr4itu9t.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We create distinctive clothing from organically produced cotton, block-printed by hand using natural dyes.

We're a small manufacturer with a big reach--we design and make garments in Jaipur that are sold around the world, in the U.K., Australia, Ireland, Germany, New Zealand, Canada  and the United States. Our company, headquartered in the heart of India’s craft industry, employs 35 full-time artisan printers, block makers, tailors, pattern makers and dye masters. We are both a fair trade artisan lifestyle brand and clothing manufacturer specializing in hand block printing techniques passed down from generation to generation in Rajasthan, India.  We are headquartered in both Jaipur, India (our manufacturing) and in Chapel Hill, NC, USA (our brand).We are expanding the Mehera Shaw brand of clothing and homewares, using certified organic cottons made in India, Ahimsa silk and AZO-free dyes.   Our new designs are ready.  But before we hit the ""go"" button, we want to extend our environmental standards to include not only sustainable fabrics and low-impact dyes, but to also improve on our water filtration during our block printing and fabric dyeing. To that end, we're launching a CleanWater4Artisans crowd-funding campaign with the goal of completing the final requirements for GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certification.  We plan to raise $35,000 to pay for a new water filtration (ETP) system at our in-house manufacturing facility in Jaipur.  Jaipur, situated in the desert of Rajasthan, is India's craft centerand home to centuries of rich textile tradition.We started the business out of a love of Jaipur's traditional block-printed textiles, and a  deep belief in Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals. We’re committed to creating jobs, treating our workers fairly, and creating bonds between our customers--you--and the people who make the clothes. When you contribute to CleanWater4Artisans, you become part of the life and future of those people, their families and their communities.   Benefits of Water FiltrationImproved water filtration and recycling means 
a better quality product for our brand and the brands across the world for whom we manufacture, 
a stronger environmental standard and 
a chance to give back to the artisans who work with us.  
The final part of our journey toward being more earth-friendly and sustainable is building a Effluent Treatment Plant [ETP]--a water filtration system--for our facility outside of Jaipur, Rajasthan.Rajasthan is a desert state.  Block printing requires a lot of water. We need to cut the amount of water we use, clean and re-use as much as we can, and discharge only water that's had the dye residue filtered out.The ETP system will remove the dye residue, meaning we can use the same water over and over for rinsing. Combined with a rainwater catchment system, we can cut our water use by up to 80 percent. That's huge!Water connects us around the globe. Clean water in India ultimately means clean water for all of us. In the West, we take clean, plentiful water for granted. When you contribute to our CleanWater4Artisans campaign, you’ll be contributing—in a small but vital way—to better lives and a healthier planet. Good Design I Environmentally Friendly Products Our mission is to be as sustainable as possible and offer the best product possible. Having an improved water filtration and recycling system will allow us to meet this goal.  Improved Standards Means the Best Product I Benefits to our Customers Good design, fair trade and sustainability go hand in hand.  Water filtration is the final step for us in making the best quality, and most sustainable product we can.  We will the be able to meet the GOTS standard. This system will mean a better quality product and will allow us to broaden our product line.  Currently, we make primarily garments and a small amount of homewares.  Going forward, we will introduce a wider range of homewares —bed linens and table linens—which use more fabric and require more water, and a wider range of GOTS certified block printed organic cotton fabrics for use in DIY and B2B collections suitable for fashion and interiors. This system will mean improved product quality assurance for our brand and for all the brands who work with us and the end customers across the world who want to make their purchases count toward doing good in the world.  For customers who want to make a difference and enjoy something of beautify and intrinsic value.We believe in transparency and in sharing the story of the process.  Our customers want to be a part of the story as it is part of how we all make a difference. Right now, we offer as much transparency as possible.  We share photos of every step of production and printing, of our artisans, how they are treated, working conditions, environmental standards.  But we don’t have full information on what ultimately happens to the water as, once it leaves our facility, it is trucked to a government facility for filtration.  We believe it is vitally important to do everything in-house so we can assure ourselves and our customers of full transparency. Water is one of our most important natural resources.  This system will help us improve our environmental footprint and make a difference to the artisans with whom we work and to the local environment.  Clean water will mean a safer environment and a longer lasting environment.  It will mean that this type of manufacturing has a future.  The fashion industry is a big player in the destruction of the environment.  We don’t believe in fast fashion or fast living.  We think slow fashion and slow living is one solution.  To reclaim balance between people, the environment and a way of life.  To this end, we support artisan production and artisan textiles.  Improving our water footprint is vital to this process. A Stronger Environmental Standard I Sustainability Goals and BenefitsFrom our inception, we have been committed to fair trade and are members of the Fair Trade Federation in the US and of the World Fair Trade Organization.  We work almost exclusively with GOTS certified organic cottons or handloom natural fibre fabrics. At our core is hand block printing, a nationally recognized heritage craft vitally important and to the artisan economy India. But block printing, like all textile processing, requires water.   We currently do everything possible to minimize the effects of chemical dyeing and conserve water.  We use only AZO free, low impact dyes, and conserve as much water as we can. But we need to do more. We need a state of the art filtration system that will allow us to recycle all of our water.  This system will also meet the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) thus assuring us of an international standard in quality and environmental preservation. Giving Back I Benefits to ArtisansBut it's not all about us! The village of Bagru, outside Jaipur, is home to dozens of individual, non-commercial block printers. They don't work for Mehera Shaw but they have the same water problem we do, and even less ability to fix it. It's important to us that they, too, have clean water as a benefit to their families and communities.We're dedicating 10 percent of the money we raise to providing home-based printers with the materials and know-how to create their own filtration systems. These simple systems will ensure that dye-contaminated water isn’t used to irrigate fields or find its way into village water supplies. These are affordable, low-maintanence systems which will also help improve the quality of artisans’ drinking water and help conserve water usage. If they choose, they can use the systems to filter drinking water from their wells. The charcoal layers of the system minimize parasites and bacteria, improving the quality of the drinking water. Traditional clay pots used to store water in Rajasthani households prevent the growth of bacteria.               Donate to CleanWater4Artisans and, the next time you turn the tap for a glass of water, know that a family in Rajasthan has fresh water because of you. Why Water?  Lifecycle of Sustainable Textile Printing  How will we spend your CleanWater4Artisans money? 
Design and build an [ETP] to filter contaminants from the wastewater that results from the block-printing  in our main facility in Sanganer.
Obtain GOTS certification
Give back 10% to village Artisans
 Stretch GoalsIf we achieve our initial goal of building the water filtration (ETP) unit our stretch goals are
Install a rainwater catchment system, to capture water during the seasonal monsoons.
Install solar panels, to reduce our dependence on the electricity grid and move us toward our goal of energy independence.
Increase the size and capacity of our block printing facility.
What GOTS-certification will mean to Mehera ShawGOTS [Global Organic Textile Standard] is the world’s gold standard for ensuring that a garment is truly organic from the harvesting of raw materials through environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing all the way to labeling. The standards apply from the planting of a cotton seed all the way through the manufacturing process, including the disposal of wastewater. Installing our ETP system is the last step in qualifying Mehera Shaw for GOTS certification.  What is involved in building an ETP? The ETP is a tertiary filtration process involving:
a physical filter to catch loose threads
a pH equalizer 
a flocculation process to draw the dyestuff out of solution
a final filtration of the water after the dye has come out of solution
We will be working with an engineer and filtration supplier who has successfully installed several GOTS compliant ETP units in the area.  History of Block Printing in RajasthanIndia-inspired, Internationally styled Mehera Shaw marries tradition and modernity, the charms of handcrafting with the sophistication of haute couture detailing. The Indian inspiration for our garments, accessories and table linens is subtle, interpreted—not copied—to blend into any lifestyle.We start with organic cotton grown in India—a blank canvas for the artisans’ craft. Print designs are sketched, then translated into hand-carved hardwood blocks, one for each color in the print. Block carving is painstaking work. Low impact, AZO free pigment dyes are mixed and fabric is stretched on specially built tables. The printer goes to work, pressing the block into the cotton time and again. The pattern undulates across the fabric with subtle variations caused by the varying pressure of the artisan’s hand. This process will be repeated for every color in the design—as many as six in some patterns.In between application of each element of the design, the fabric is rinsed, line-dried, rinsed again, hung to dry, then rinsed once more. The rinse water becomes laden with dye and fiber. Both have to be filtered so that the water can be reused several times before being released safely as wastewater.The traditional process of hand block printing on textiles, with rich natural colors, has been practiced in Rajasthan for around 500 years.  Block printing was introduced to the Jaipur region of Rajasthan by the Chhipa community.  This community was originally located in Bagru Village, an area now famous for its vegetable dye and mud resist (dabu) block prints.  The art of block printing has been passed down for generations within families and communities and has branched out in recent decades to other regions such as Sanganer, just South of Jaipur.  In traditional Bagru style block printing, the ‘recipes’ for the traditional plant-based dyes are developed within each family and kept alive from generation to generation.  The colors are dependent on the quality of the plants, the water and skill and knowledge of the printing masters.  In more recent forms of block printing, such as those practiced in Sanganer, colors are mixed using AZO free pigment dyes.  STEP 1: Block CarvingA print starts with the design, drawn on paper and carved into the Sheesham wood block.  Designs are meticulously carved by hand into the blocks which are approximately 18-25 cm across.  The physical block is the design for a single repeat which is then stamped in rows across the fabric.  Each color in the design is carved into a separate block.  Depending on the colors in the design, the ground color block or 'gud' or the outline block or 'rekh', (which is the most intricate) and usually stamped first; it is typically the outline for a floral or lattice type design.  Next comes the fill block or 'datta'.  Block carving is in itself an art requiring years of apprenticeship to gain mastery and is done entirely by hand.   STEP 2: Color Mixing-Preparing the DyesOnce the blocks are carved, the master printer prepares the colors which will be used in printing.  The colors are then poured into wooden trays and the blocks stamped in the color each time, then stamped onto the fabric to form the repeat pattern.  The colors shown are AZO free, low-impact pigment dyes which are used in Sanganer printing.For each new design, we do a color check and test out new color combinations.  We use Pantone  reference codes for color matching.  In the photos, our master printer, Ghanshyam Ji is working with our team to develop a series of new colorways with our new collection. STEP 3: Printing ProcessEach color pattern is stamped individually onto the fabric; the process takes skill and time, as the pattern must be stamped repeatedly across the fabric, color by color. The slight human irregularities — inevitable in handwork — create the artistic effect emblematic of block prints.  The final outcome of this intricate labor is a timeless beauty, and every garment made from this fabric is unique.The printing master must carefully align each block as he prints, using the ‘guide’ carved on the left edge of the block as his marker.  Each printer has a slightly different style which is considered his ‘signature’ look.  The printing master must then follow the same pattern of aligning the blocks with each color layered on to the design.  The subtle gaps and overlaps are a beautiful reminder of the hand work and give block printing it’s iconic look.  All prints exemplify this aesthetic and have a subtle pattern of light/dark across the design. Who We Are -   Mehera Shaw, LLCWe create distinctive clothing from organically produced cotton, block-printed by hand using natural dyes.

<p> </p>
<p>We've developed a <strong>patent-pending algorithm</strong> that analyzes your face scan and builds a 3D model of the custom pad for your mask. All Buddie needs from you is your scan! Scanning can be done on any iPhone X or newer using the <strong>Bellus3D</strong> <strong>FaceApp</strong> scanning application.</p>

</div></div>","Meet Buddie:  the mask made for you
 

 
Buddie is a protective, stylish face mask customized to fit each individual wearer. We use 3D scanning to map the contour of your face and 3D printing to create a customized silicone pad for your mask. Buddie's customized silicone pad creates a virtually airtight seal to each wearer's face without applying an excessive amount of pressure; this guarantees both maximum safety and ultimate comfort. 

One mask for the pandemic
One mask for the future
 
On his first day in office, President Joe Biden has mandated 100 days of mask wearing for all US citizens. The vaccine is coming, but COVID-19 is still a threat. Buddie is here to protect you and your loved ones during the final stretch of the pandemic. Buddie will not only keep you safe, but will also keep you comfortable and enhance your style as you emerge into the post-quarantine world! Buddie will be by your side for the future, keeping you prepared to face worsening pollution, health crises, and anything else this world throws at you.

These proportions were optimized so you can benefit from the natural features of cotton, but also enjoy maximum performance. SUPER-SMOOTH INTERIORThoughtful design means our socks have minimal loose threads on the inside, leading to a smoother sock that lays flat and doesn't leave marks on your feet and calves after daily wear. PRECISION FITWe've added high quality Lycra fibers in key areas of the sock so they fit each part of your foot with high precision. 3 SIZES - M, L, XLTired of socks that are too big or too small? We solve this by giving you 3 options so that your socks fit you, not the other way around.       FOLLOW US   We started Module in 2018 because we wanted to reinvent common staples that have been overlooked by major brands. Our goal is to create a lasting, global brand, with sustainable and ethical business practices. In the last year, we've attended trade shows, visited and negotiated contracts with numerous manufacturers and built a design and engineering team.      Our team has 5 years of global e-commerce experience prior to founding Module, and we are happy to offer both domestic and international shipping options: DOMESTICOur socks will ship out of our New York-based warehouse via USPS and should arrive at your address within 3-8 business days, depending on location.  INTERNATIONALWe will use the appropriate global courier (FedEX, USPS, etc) to ship to your country.  You may have to pay additional import duties and other applicable taxes to customs upon receipt of the shipment. The duties and tax rates vary from country to country. EXCHANGE POLICY If you follow the sizing chart above, the socks should fit you perfectly. However, we want to make sure you are completely satisfied. If you would like to exchange your socks for any reason, we'll happily offer an exchange but you will have to pay for two-way shipping. Because we are offering our socks at highly discounted prices on Kickstarter, we are unable to accept returns. Please make sure your items are unworn, unwashed, and in the same condition that you received them. We will accept exchanges up to 30 days of you receiving the socks.",57.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>All BRANDD designs are handmade with the finest hand picked Gemstones, Pearls and Lead-Free Swarovski® Elements. </p>
<p><b>Gemstone:</b> (also called a fine gem, jewel, or a precious or semi-presious stone) is a piece of mineral, wich, in cut and polished form, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. However, certain rocks or organic materials that are not minerals are also used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well.</p>
<p><b>Pearl:</b> A peral is a hard object produced within teh soft tissue (specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk. Just like the shell of a clam, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate in minute crystalline from, which has been deposited in concentric layers. the ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes occur. The finest quality natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. because of this, <i>""pearl""</i>  has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable and valuable.</p>

them.</p>

ourselves to dive into the entrepreneurship world. This challenge is faced with eagerness though also aware of  the obstacles we may encounter. Now is the moment to reach out for strength in order to

mind, we give birth to the Solidarity T-Shirt.</p>

<br/><ul> </ul> </div> </div>","Garabattos is a design and stamping t-shirt project produced by a
handcraft process. We work with lot of effort and love. We are passionate for
designing and we love tees, each design created is done for people to enjoy and
share with others, to laugh with the humor implied or even feel identified with
them.
We are a small workshop of artisans who have encouraged
ourselves to dive into the entrepreneurship world. This challenge is faced with eagerness though also aware of  the obstacles we may encounter. Now is the moment to reach out for strength in order to
move on to the next stage, you can be part of this force. We need your help!
In our personal life, we are linked one way or another with social
cooperation. The call for sharing with others our time, our efforts and even
our possessions, is why we want this business to be also a means of
collaboration with society, reaching for the common wellbeing. With this in
mind, we give birth to the Solidarity T-Shirt.




 


This parallel, yet directly linked project, the Solidarity T-Shirt,
consists in choosing and producing one design per month, whose entire 100% benefits
during the same period will be used to support a social cause. Our supporters
can decide the social service chosen to receive this aid. Garabattos will
present a group of candidates that may be granted with the aid, and our
supporters will be able to vote for the final beneficiary.






We need to leave the garage start-up project behind. Actually due to
our budget limitations, we use homemade machinery, and our stamping corner is
our home itself.
It is time to move forward, we need professional silk-screening machinery,
we don't want automatic equipment, we want to keep its craftsmanship, but we
need to optimize working time.
Our wish is to start as soon as possible with the social cooperation
project, the Solidarity T-Shirt. Therefore we need to have the adequate tools
and facilities in order to fulfill the demands and by these means be able
to help others.
For these reasons we are here in Indiegogo, using this platform as a
stand for calling your attention and asking for your help in order to continue
this road we have so gladly taken. Of course your help has pleasant rewards.

 


Among the offered rewards, we could not leave behind our designs. Take a look at our current catalogue for this campaign, it may be updated with the new designs we work on. 

 



We have women's tees for yours rewards, you can choose them. If you want to combine designs, sizes and type of shirt... you can do it.
