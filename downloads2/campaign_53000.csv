Additionally, we will offer cupcake decorating birthday parties where children can celebrate their special day while learning an exciting new skill.Sweet Cakes Supplies, LLC is woman-owned partnership comprised of two locally successful, professional businessowners: Vanessa Ross and Ashley Desjardins. In addition, to creating award winning cakes and cupcakes, Vanessa and Ashley already conduct cupcake decorating classes at the local wineries, florists and breweries. Students surveyed have expressed a desire to return for more advanced level instruction. MarketThe target market for Sweet Cakes Supplies will be three-fold:1. Hobbyists looking for exciting new skills in the form of cake and cupcake decorating. 2. Parents looking for an innovative environment for their child’s birthday party. 3. Industry professionals in need of supplies. By providing baked goods, classes, parties, retail and commercial sales we will have a multi-faceted approach to business that will provide protection in fluctuating markets. First Fridays, Festivals and Car Shows will give us exposure as a primary attractive downtown business. As we grow, we look forward to adding a variety classes, bring in higher exposure instructors, add themed parties, ladies or men’s events, children’s classes, corporate team building, etc. CompetitionThere is no other known cake decorating business within a two-hour drive offering cupcake or cake decorating classes. While the local Walmart offers decorating supplies, their inventory is very limited and often out of stock. The nearest hobby stores are more than a one-hour drive in opposite directions. Neither Walmart, Hobby Lobby or Michaels offers classroom instruction. Why Us?Vanessa has successfully operated Vanessa Ross Cakes for over eight years and has been commissioned to create cakes for wedding designers Hayley Paige, Lazaro and Matthew Christopher. Ashley createdd Simply Sweet in early 2020 and, despite Covid-19 restrictions, has had an amazing year that included a drive-thru cupcake stand and cupcakes in Toot Sweets in Oxford. Vanessa and Ashely are well known and respected business owners with deep ties to the community and the cake industry. Financial NeedBased on the cost of the equipment and tools, inventory and our first month’s expenses we anticipate a total of $35,000 instartup costs. While we have included the cost of cabinets and a triple sink in the equipment list the actual construction of the kitchenette and additional plumbing expenses remain unknowns to date. We will take every step necessary to save money by purchasing excellent used equipment. With the exception of the plumbing work needed, we will be doing all the demolition, construction, painting and floor installation ourselves. We are seeking to raise $15,000 in capital to bring this project to fruition.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Reliable, Traceable, High Quality, Specialty Coffee. It’s what drives us and what drove one family to move 10,000 miles to impact the lives of coffee growers. Bright Java exists to equip Indonesian farmers with better tools and education and to add value to the work they are already doing. We believe in building relationships with those we work with.Want to see what this coffee is about? Donate so we can send some to you.</p>

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>We are Troy and Renda, Americans who have been on an incredible journey that has taken us to the center of the 4th largest coffee producing nation in the world.  In 2013 Troy retired from a career in the US Marines thinking there must be a better way to solve problems with people who don’t agree with us than Predator drone strikes and AC-130 Gunship runs.  After spending 18 months in an RV traveling the US we, with our family of five children they moved to Thailand to take a course in how to use business to help solve the most intractable development problems in the world.  Post that we ended up in Central Java, Indonesia to put into practice the skills we learned.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543241813/lr5dywk8gxhjinszzdmq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Indonesia falls only behind Brazil, Vietnam and Columbia as the largest coffee exporting nation in the world and was the first place outside of the Arabian Peninsula where coffee was cultivated.  Even now in America the name of Indonesia’s most populous island is synonymous with the word coffee.  While still studying language and culture Troy met Aswan, who shared a desire to help Indonesian peoples through social business and a love of all things coffee.  In May 2017 we partnered with Aswan to form Bright Java.  Since then we have added to our team with Desi who does our accounting, admin and compliance, Eko who engages with grower communities and Taylor, roaster and social media engagement guru.  We have come far in that time from exporting our first ton of coffee to the USA to exporting and entire shipping container’s (eighteen tons) worth of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>What we Do</strong></p>
<p>Bright Java exists to equip Indonesian farmers with better tools and education and to add value to the work they are already doing. When we find a producer, be it a single family, a small milling operation, or a cooperative group, we first evaluate their coffee. If it’s specialty grade we then find markets for it among our buyer networks. Outside of that we try to make a long term arrangement with a grower who will agree to stringent quality standards to produce the best possible coffee.  Once ready we bring that coffee to international markets. We aim to give vision to the supply chain and show the connection to the grower for all our sourced coffees.  Think about how you want your next coffee a nondescript product served up by a mega retailer, or a connection with a family laboring thousands of miles away?</p>
<p>We partner with Indonesian small holder coffee farmers and form long term, beneficial relationships with them.  We are dedicated to helping farmers improve their coffees to specialty quality and bring their product to a global audience. We believe when we’ve been given more than we need we have a responsibility to help others; we want to create better lives for generations to come and leave an impact that outlives us.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543242000/xpsuh31wdzyrjp5apm1t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Coffee is about connecting people, whether through sitting down at a latte in a café or purchasing a ton of red cherries from a grower for further processing.  We want the locals to be proud of what they are producing, we want them to have a fair chance among the bigger players. We provide a channel to outside markets while giving fair buying prices.  We believe in being connected to our coffee farmers and their lives as they produce some of the best coffee Indonesia has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What We Believe</strong></p>
<p>We believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>That business, specifically the business of specialty coffee export, can be used as a tool to help alleviate the intractable problems faced in the developing world: war, poverty, disease and hunger</li>
<li>That cultivating real relationships with our coffee farmers and building this business on transparency, trust and equality is beneficial for everyone in the coffee value chain</li>
<li>That by residing at origin we can provide accountability and traceability in delivering high quality coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why You Should Care         </strong><strong>  </strong></p>
<p>Did you know that you, the consumer, can drink amazing coffee while having a direct impact on the lives of those that produce it?  We do it without expensive and hard-to-verify certification schemes that smallholder farmers cannot afford.  We do that through relationship. </p>
<p>It’s all about sustainability. We care about the people we source from, and believe you should too.  A broker or middle man may offer a farmer an insanely low price for their red cherries before they are even harvested.  We would prefer that farmer process his own or set up a co-op with neighbors and keep more of the available profit. Partner with us to see that our producers can attain a better life through coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Our Coffees</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are currently sourcing green coffee from small holders in the following regions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sumatra; Aceh Gayo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sumatra; North Sumatra Simalungun</strong></p>
<p><strong>West Java; Preangar</strong></p>
<p><strong>Central Java; Merbabu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bali; Kintamani</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sulawesi; Toraja </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need to prepare for the 2019 harvest. Inventory from 2018 has got to go so we can position ourselves in early May 2019 to invest into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purchase 4-10 tons of West Java green beans</strong>— We found a great co-op that we want to begin working at the end of the 2018 harvest, too late to buy their beans.  This co-op already has a processing station and stringent production standards.  What they lack is a viable market for their beans. We can provide that with our network of green importers.  <strong>$20,700 USD</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Purchase a 300kg Central Java microlot</strong>—A microlot is a smaller consignment of coffee, usually much less than a shipping container's worth.  We have the option to purchase one of the best microlots we found during the end of the 2018 season.  <strong>$2,300 USD</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Build our own processing plant</strong>— We have the opportunity to increase the coffee quality in the growing area nearest to us by actually installing our own wash station.  By buying up the freshest red cherries from the individual farmers we can process their harvest to a stringent, uniform quality standard and net top dollar in order to give back a percentage to the grower. <strong>$7,000 USD</strong>
</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Reliable, Traceable, High Quality, Specialty Coffee. It’s what drives us and what drove one family to move 10,000 miles to impact the lives of coffee growers. Bright Java exists to equip Indonesian farmers with better tools and education and to add value to the work they are already doing. We believe in building relationships with those we work with.Want to see what this coffee is about? Donate so we can send some to you.

Who We Are
We are Troy and Renda, Americans who have been on an incredible journey that has taken us to the center of the 4th largest coffee producing nation in the world.  In 2013 Troy retired from a career in the US Marines thinking there must be a better way to solve problems with people who don’t agree with us than Predator drone strikes and AC-130 Gunship runs.  After spending 18 months in an RV traveling the US we, with our family of five children they moved to Thailand to take a course in how to use business to help solve the most intractable development problems in the world.  Post that we ended up in Central Java, Indonesia to put into practice the skills we learned.
Indonesia falls only behind Brazil, Vietnam and Columbia as the largest coffee exporting nation in the world and was the first place outside of the Arabian Peninsula where coffee was cultivated.  Even now in America the name of Indonesia’s most populous island is synonymous with the word coffee.  While still studying language and culture Troy met Aswan, who shared a desire to help Indonesian peoples through social business and a love of all things coffee.  In May 2017 we partnered with Aswan to form Bright Java.  Since then we have added to our team with Desi who does our accounting, admin and compliance, Eko who engages with grower communities and Taylor, roaster and social media engagement guru.  We have come far in that time from exporting our first ton of coffee to the USA to exporting and entire shipping container’s (eighteen tons) worth of coffee.
What we Do
Bright Java exists to equip Indonesian farmers with better tools and education and to add value to the work they are already doing. When we find a producer, be it a single family, a small milling operation, or a cooperative group, we first evaluate their coffee. If it’s specialty grade we then find markets for it among our buyer networks. Outside of that we try to make a long term arrangement with a grower who will agree to stringent quality standards to produce the best possible coffee.  Once ready we bring that coffee to international markets. We aim to give vision to the supply chain and show the connection to the grower for all our sourced coffees.  Think about how you want your next coffee a nondescript product served up by a mega retailer, or a connection with a family laboring thousands of miles away?
We partner with Indonesian small holder coffee farmers and form long term, beneficial relationships with them.  We are dedicated to helping farmers improve their coffees to specialty quality and bring their product to a global audience. We believe when we’ve been given more than we need we have a responsibility to help others; we want to create better lives for generations to come and leave an impact that outlives us.
Coffee is about connecting people, whether through sitting down at a latte in a café or purchasing a ton of red cherries from a grower for further processing.  We want the locals to be proud of what they are producing, we want them to have a fair chance among the bigger players. We provide a channel to outside markets while giving fair buying prices.  We believe in being connected to our coffee farmers and their lives as they produce some of the best coffee Indonesia has to offer.
What We Believe
We believe:

That business, specifically the business of specialty coffee export, can be used as a tool to help alleviate the intractable problems faced in the developing world: war, poverty, disease and hunger
That cultivating real relationships with our coffee farmers and building this business on transparency, trust and equality is beneficial for everyone in the coffee value chain
That by residing at origin we can provide accountability and traceability in delivering high quality coffee.


 
Why You Should Care           
Did you know that you, the consumer, can drink amazing coffee while having a direct impact on the lives of those that produce it?  We do it without expensive and hard-to-verify certification schemes that smallholder farmers cannot afford.  We do that through relationship. 
It’s all about sustainability. We care about the people we source from, and believe you should too.  A broker or middle man may offer a farmer an insanely low price for their red cherries before they are even harvested.  We would prefer that farmer process his own or set up a co-op with neighbors and keep more of the available profit. Partner with us to see that our producers can attain a better life through coffee.
Our Coffees
We are currently sourcing green coffee from small holders in the following regions:
Sumatra; Aceh Gayo
Sumatra; North Sumatra Simalungun
West Java; Preangar
Central Java; Merbabu
Bali; Kintamani
Sulawesi; Toraja 
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need to prepare for the 2019 harvest. Inventory from 2018 has got to go so we can position ourselves in early May 2019 to invest into the following:


Purchase 4-10 tons of West Java green beans— We found a great co-op that we want to begin working at the end of the 2018 harvest, too late to buy their beans.  This co-op already has a processing station and stringent production standards.  What they lack is a viable market for their beans. We can provide that with our network of green importers.  $20,700 USD


Purchase a 300kg Central Java microlot—A microlot is a smaller consignment of coffee, usually much less than a shipping container's worth.  We have the option to purchase one of the best microlots we found during the end of the 2018 season.  $2,300 USD


Build our own processing plant— We have the opportunity to increase the coffee quality in the growing area nearest to us by actually installing our own wash station.  By buying up the freshest red cherries from the individual farmers we can process their harvest to a stringent, uniform quality standard and net top dollar in order to give back a percentage to the grower. $7,000 USD

<p>My name is William Bryant and I’m a husband, father of 3 boys, DJ for over twenty years, and living a plant-based lifestyle for over six years. I created Juiceade to empower communities to take control of their health. I want to provide a cold-pressed juice bar in neighborhoods where it’s hard to find healthy food options. With your assistance I will create healthy and delicious juices and smoothies while educating and demonstrating how eating healthy can empower you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The money raised will go towards the purchase of a new commercial grade cold press juicer and to the plumbing costs associates with the installation of two service sinks. As a “Thank you” for you much appreciated donation, we are offering enamel pins, hats, and t-shirts, and personal juice cleanse plans based on your donation level. If our full goal is not met, then the funds will go towards the purchase of used equipment and to start the plumbing process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a society ruled by cheap fast food franchises, I hope Juiceade can become a beacon on the road to getting healthy instead of swimming in a sea of junk food. Your body is your temple and we want to empower those that are looking for guidance to keep their temple running like a well-oiled machine. I speak from experience; through juicing and adopting a plant-based diet, I lost over 50 pounds without any exercise. I grew up in neighborhoods that didn’t have a lot of healthy options, you’d be hard pressed to find a piece of fruit in the local bodega. Most chronic diseases that affect the Black and Latino communities are preventable and directly related to the food you eat. That’s why I have made it my mission to empower these communities to take charge of their health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have experience working in a juicebar and plant-based restaurants to learn the business hands on and I can’t wait to embark on this journey with Juiceade. I appreciate any donation, big or small, it’s all love. Please help spread the word about my campaign on your social media, even if you can’ provide financial support at this time. Thank you!</p>

<p>Domenic and his wife, Tina, have been western PA natives since birth.  He’s been a butcher by trade since high school, and she’s done everything from food trucks to catering to running a coffee shop.  Now by their awesome powers combined, they plan to create their own business, one that provides a much-needed service to the neighborhood of Allentown.</p>
<p>The Black Market is a one-stop shop for deli meats and cheeses, fresh-cut meat, prepared foods, and other essential groceries.  We even offer a comfy space to sit down and enjoy a fresh cooked dinner.  It all started with our famous beef jerky we’ve been crafting for several years now.  From that simple venture, a flood of new ideas flowed.  A plan was in place to create everything in-house, from fresh oven-roasted turkey breast, to corned beef, to a bevy of sausages, and so much more.</p>
<p>All our ideas needed was a home, and as luck would have it, they would find a home inside “Breakfast at Shelly’s”.  An amazing diner with an unused deli space, sitting in the heart of a neighborhood desperately in need of a deli.</p>
<p> It was perfect.  Well, almost perfect…</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>This is where you come in.</h3>
<p>You see, the deli isn’t ready to go just quite yet.  Some work still needs done before we can get the green light and all the permits in place.  The floor will need retiled and the countertops will need refinished.  One of the deli cases also needs a little love from our friendly neighborhood HVAC man.  On top of this, we will need startup funds to build inventory, to spread the good word through advertising, and to buy some necessary pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>So, we turn to you for help.  But don’t think your financial assist won’t go unrewarded.  Aside from the obvious good karma and having a fantastic new place to eat, we plan to offer a ton of great unique rewards.  Ones that we feel will really get those charitable juices flowing.   </p>
<p>If we reach our goals, not only will you still have Shelly to provide some of the best breakfast and lunch in town for years to come, but now you can fill your fridge at home with some fantastic, one-of-a-kind products, created with the love and skill brought about by years of training and family tradition.  It’s our belief that not only will this benefit the people of Allentown dramatically, but this will bring men and woman from all over the city of Pittsburgh as well.</p>
<p> Even if we don't reach our financial goal, we will put every dollar donated towards the most essential parts of our project to get ourselves up and running.  </p>
<p>And on the other side, if we exceed our goal, we will use that extra money to upgrade and purchase brand new equipment that will further expand what we can do in our establishment.  If we get enough extra cash, expect to see things like special humidity controlled coolers that help us craft dry-cured delights like salami and Prosciutto.     </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Any new business faces plenty of risks and challenges, of course. </h3>
<p>One of our biggest risks is going up against the corporate food chains like Giant Eagle and Whole Foods.  It is our belief, though, that our products will be more than competitive, not just in price, but in quality and commitment.  We are confident we will earn the local support, not just of those on the hilltop, but of those across the city.</p>
<p>Another challenge we face comes from the building itself.  It, along with much of the equipment in it, has been around for a while and maintenance costs will be a concern.  In our business plan projections, I’ve factored those costs in and we still forecast to be on very stable footing.  </p>
<p>Lastly, as we progress, we will be working with the USDA to gain an important license that will help us sell key products outside of our shop.  This process, while somewhat daunting, has been one that I have worked on for years now and feel very confident (with the building in place) that we can now complete.  The benefit is that our brand will reach out, not just through the city, but over time, through other states as well.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate any and all contributions, but understand that some people can’t really commit financially.  Trust us, we get it.  But there are plenty of other ways you can help.  The biggest?  Spread the word.  Tell as many people you can.  The more the merrier.  Share this fundraiser with everyone you know and any local business that will listen.  Also, there may be a time when we need some help with renovations or a project.  If you got the talent and free time, hit us up!  We can pay you in meat and beer. </p>

<h3>Our new shop &amp; workshop</h3>
<p>Hey, I am Martina, owner of My3Cakes. I started my company 6 months ago with a goal that everyone can create their own cupcake flavor. In just a few months I wrote a business plan, put my idea into action and started off as an entrepreneur. I found myself doing the job of my dreams, I found my strengths, my qualities and my abilities to create a new and successful entrepreneurial story. My3Cakes are growing, developing and finding their place under the sun. Meetings, various events, conferences, networking, I am everywhere because I believe in my products and I want everyone to hear about them and try them. Many newspapers and media outlets have recognized my persistence and commitment and have written about my entrepreneurial venture which I am very grateful for. Big future awaits My3Cakes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527846909/ntdqb0ulyo9lkttqvuws.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now I want to expand and open a shop &amp; workshop where you would literally be able to create your own cupcake. You found a recipe, decided to go and make a cupcake and then realized that either you didn't have the right sized pan, you were missing a decorating tip, or that you made a mistake during preparation and cupcakes were ruined.</p>
<p>For these reasons I want to create a space where you would get everything at one place: a place to work, all the necessary equipment and appliances, groceries and expert guidance so that you wouldn't have another cupcake catastrophe. Also, it would be a place where your kids could let their imagination go and create their own special cupcakes or cakepops.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527849937/vkuhzenht8brkm8smdnx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I have a team who share my passion and want to see that dream transforming into reality. They are helping that everything goes right through this campaign and I am very grateful for their support.</p>
<p>You can support us as well by choosing one of the perks on the right. And make sure to tell your friends about My3Cakes shop &amp; workshop by sharing our campaign through your social media profiles!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527850056/oge9drnjpexj5a91fazv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We're really excited to be able to offer our supporters the chance to be a part of the opening of our first shop &amp; workshop. We have prepared lots of special rewards to thank them for getting involved.</p>
<p>Everyone who contributes will be able to enjoy badges, tea towels, aprons, tote bags, and copies of My3Cakes recipe book, along with boxes of cupcakes, and free baking classes. Special My3Cakes cupcake in a form of a stuffed toy will be offered in a limited edition, as a perfect present for our little ones.</p>
<p>We'll get in touch immediately following the end of the campaign to give you everything you need to come and claim your cupcakes once the shop &amp; workshop opens. All Indiegogo supporters will have one year to claim their cupcakes, and can claim a maximum of two boxes per visit.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Why open shop &amp; workshop?</h3>
<p>The shop would have a commercial area and a separate area for production. Since the story about cupcakes is spreading very quickly we want to hire more people so that My3Cakes would become a brand famous for its quality and tasty products. For this reason we need more space to start a bigger production and to hire at least two more people. Cupcakes, cupcake cakes &amp; cakepops will be sold in front of the production area. We will have a daily offer from our wide range of cupcake flavors. Since we plan to open around Christmas we will have lots of work, but we are excited to see lots of families enjoy our special cupcakes soon.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527850225/qblushmfth0bmnugpnev.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>In the commercial area of the shop we will plan to hold cupcake classes, workshops and cupcake birthdays for children. Here, people would have the opportunity to come and rent a kitchen for a few hours and make their own cupcakes using all available tools and equipment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527850252/wa9yb6d47wdgjewvomno.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We want to raise money to buy professional appliances and to open a new shop &amp; workshop. We have few locations on hold and in the next month we will decide where to open the new My3Cakes shop &amp; workshop. We are very determined and ready to start this project and finish it by December 2018. </p>
<p>We know that the timeline might be tight, but we have already contacted contractors and architects who are waiting our confirmation about the location so the work can start. We are confident we can hit our goal of opening in time for Christmas, but any delays we do incur will not affect our supporters' ability to redeem their rewards when the shop &amp; workhop does open.</p>
<p>We're ready to face the multitude of risks and challenges that are sure to come with the opening of our first shop &amp; workshop, but we believe that we can achieve our goal and set our first My3Cakes shop &amp; workshop in Zagreb.</p>

<p><strong>Naš novi prodajni prostor i radionica</strong></p>
<p>Bok, ja sam Martina, vlasnica My3Cakes. Pokrenula sam vlastitu tvrtku prije 6 mjeseci s ciljem da svatko može kreirati slasticu po svojem ukusu. U samo nekoliko mjeseci napisala sam poslovni plan, pokrenula svoju ideju i krenula u poduzetništvo. Pronašla sam se u tome, otkrila svoju snagu, svoje prednosti, kvalitete i sposobnosti da kreiram jednu novu i uspješnu poduzetničku priču. My3Cakes raste, razvija se, pronalazi svoje mjesto pod suncem. Sastanci, razni eventi, konferencije, networking, svugdje sam jer vjerujem u svoje proizvode i želim da svi čuju o njima i da ih probaju. Mnoge novine i portali prepoznali su moju upornost i predanost te pisali o mom poduzetničkom pothvatu na čemu sam im iznimno zahvalna. My3Cakes čeka velika budućnost, u to sam uvjerena.</p>
<p>Želim otvoriti prodavaonicu i radionicu u koju ćete vi moći doći i doslovno napraviti cupcake baš po svojem ukusu. Sigurno vam se dogodilo da ste odlučili napraviti cupcake po nekom receptu i onda shvatili da ili nemate odgovarajući kalup za izradu, ili vam nedostaje neki nastavak za ukrašavanje, ili se prilikom izrade dogodila neka pogreška i cupcake nije uspio.</p>
<p>Iz tih razloga želim otvoriti kuhinju u kojoj ćete dobiti sve na jednom mjestu: prostor za rad, opremu i aparate, namirnice i stručno vodstvo da se ne dogodi cupcake katastrofa. To bi također bilo i mjesto gdje bi i vaši klinci mogli pustiti mašti na volju i kreirati svoje posebne cupcakese ili cakepopse.</p>
<p>Imam iza sebe tim ljudi koji dijeli moj entuzijazam i želi vidjeti kako moj san postaje stvarnost. Pomažu mi da sve prođe kako treba u ovoj kampanji i na tome sam im neizmjerno zahvalna.</p>
<p>Možete nas podržati odabirom jednog od perk-ova na desnoj strani. I recite svojim prijateljima o priči My3Cakes prodavaonice &amp; radionice tako da podijelite našu kampanju preko svojih profila na društvenim mrežama!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Što dobivate ovom kampanjom?</strong></p>
<p>Jako smo uzbuđeni što možemo našim pokroviteljima dati priliku da postanu dio priče otvaranja naše prve prodavaonice &amp; radionice. Pripremili smo mnoštvo specijalnih nagrada kako bismo im zahvalili na sudjelovanju.</p>
<p>Kao znak zahvale predviđene su brojne nagrade: specijalni bedževi, kuhinjske krpe, pregače, velike torbe, My3Cakes kuharice, kutije cupcakesa te besplatni tečajevi izrade cupcakesa. Poseban My3Cakes plišanac bit će u ograničenoj ponudi kao idealan dar za najmlađe.</p>
<p>Kontaktirat ćemo vas odmah po završetku kampanje kako biste dobili sve potrebne informacije za preuzimanje svoje nagrade u trenutku kada se prodavaonica &amp; radionica otvori. Svi Indiegogo pokrovitelji imat će godinu dana za prikup svojim cupcakesa, i mogu zatražiti najviše dva pakiranja po dolasku.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Zašto otvaramo prodavaonicu &amp; radionicu?</strong></p>
<p>Prostor bi sadržavao kuhinju za komercijalne svrhe te kuhinju za proizvodnju. Budući da se priča o cupcakesima uspješno širi želimo zaposliti još ljudi kako bi My3Cakes postao sinonim kvalitetnih i ukusnih proizvoda. Zato trebamo veći prostor kako bismo mogli povećati proizvodnju i zaposliti najmanje dvoje ljudi. Cupcakesi, cupcake torte &amp; cakepopsi bi se prodavali ispred proizvodnog dijela. Imali bismo dnevnu ponudu raznovrsnih slastica. Budući da je planirano otvorenje do Božića imati ćemo puno posla, ali smo jako uzbuđeni uskoro vidjeti brojne obitelji kako dolaze uživati u posebnoj cupcake ponudi.  </p>
<p>U komercijalnom prostoru prodavaonice planiramo održavati tečajeve, radionice i cupcake rođendanske proslave za djecu. Ovdje bi ljudi imali mogućnost unajmiti kuhinju na nekoliko sati i prirediti vlastite cupcakese koristeći svu potrebnu opremu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rizici i izazovi</strong></p>
<p>Želimo prikupiti novac za nabavku profesionalne slastičarske opreme te kako bismo mogli otvoriti novu prodavaonicu &amp; radionicu. Trenutno je nekoliko potencijalnih lokacija na čekanju te ćemo u sljedećih mjesec dana odlučiti gdje ćemo otvoriti My3Cakes prodavaonicu &amp; radionicu. Odlučno započinjemo ovaj projekt i planiramo ga završiti do prosinca 2018. godine.</p>
<p>Svjesni smo da je vremenski rok malo kratak, ali već smo kontaktirali sve izvođače i arhitekte koji čekaju potvrdu lokacije kako bi radovi mogli početi. Uvjereni smo da možemo dostići cilj otvorenja do Božića, a bilo koja zakašnjenja u rokovima do kojih bi moglo putem doći neće utjecati na naše pokrovitelje koji će moći prikupiti svoje nagrade čim se prodavaonica &amp; radionica otvori.</p>
<p>Spremni smo suočiti se s mnoštvo rizika i izazova koji će doći s otvaranjem prodajnog prostora, ali vjerujemo da možemo postići sve što smo si zacrtali i otvoriti prvi My3Cakes prodavaonicu &amp; radionicu u Zagrebu.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Učinimo svijet ljepšim, cupcake po cupcake!</strong></p>
<p>Podržite nas odabirom jedne od nagrada na desnoj strani. I recite svojim prijateljima o priči My3Cakes prodavaonice &amp; radionice tako da podijelite našu kampanju preko svojih profila na društvenim mrežama!</p>

Iz tih razloga želim otvoriti kuhinju u kojoj ćete dobiti sve na jednom mjestu: prostor za rad, opremu i aparate, namirnice i stručno vodstvo da se ne dogodi cupcake katastrofa. To bi također bilo i mjesto gdje bi i vaši klinci mogli pustiti mašti na volju i kreirati svoje posebne cupcakese ili cakepopse.
Imam iza sebe tim ljudi koji dijeli moj entuzijazam i želi vidjeti kako moj san postaje stvarnost. Pomažu mi da sve prođe kako treba u ovoj kampanji i na tome sam im neizmjerno zahvalna.
Možete nas podržati odabirom jednog od perk-ova na desnoj strani. I recite svojim prijateljima o priči My3Cakes prodavaonice & radionice tako da podijelite našu kampanju preko svojih profila na društvenim mrežama!
 
Što dobivate ovom kampanjom?
Jako smo uzbuđeni što možemo našim pokroviteljima dati priliku da postanu dio priče otvaranja naše prve prodavaonice & radionice. Pripremili smo mnoštvo specijalnih nagrada kako bismo im zahvalili na sudjelovanju.
Kao znak zahvale predviđene su brojne nagrade: specijalni bedževi, kuhinjske krpe, pregače, velike torbe, My3Cakes kuharice, kutije cupcakesa te besplatni tečajevi izrade cupcakesa. Poseban My3Cakes plišanac bit će u ograničenoj ponudi kao idealan dar za najmlađe.
Kontaktirat ćemo vas odmah po završetku kampanje kako biste dobili sve potrebne informacije za preuzimanje svoje nagrade u trenutku kada se prodavaonica & radionica otvori. Svi Indiegogo pokrovitelji imat će godinu dana za prikup svojim cupcakesa, i mogu zatražiti najviše dva pakiranja po dolasku.
 
Zašto otvaramo prodavaonicu & radionicu?
Prostor bi sadržavao kuhinju za komercijalne svrhe te kuhinju za proizvodnju. Budući da se priča o cupcakesima uspješno širi želimo zaposliti još ljudi kako bi My3Cakes postao sinonim kvalitetnih i ukusnih proizvoda. Zato trebamo veći prostor kako bismo mogli povećati proizvodnju i zaposliti najmanje dvoje ljudi. Cupcakesi, cupcake torte & cakepopsi bi se prodavali ispred proizvodnog dijela. Imali bismo dnevnu ponudu raznovrsnih slastica. Budući da je planirano otvorenje do Božića imati ćemo puno posla, ali smo jako uzbuđeni uskoro vidjeti brojne obitelji kako dolaze uživati u posebnoj cupcake ponudi.  
U komercijalnom prostoru prodavaonice planiramo održavati tečajeve, radionice i cupcake rođendanske proslave za djecu. Ovdje bi ljudi imali mogućnost unajmiti kuhinju na nekoliko sati i prirediti vlastite cupcakese koristeći svu potrebnu opremu.
 
Rizici i izazovi
Želimo prikupiti novac za nabavku profesionalne slastičarske opreme te kako bismo mogli otvoriti novu prodavaonicu & radionicu. Trenutno je nekoliko potencijalnih lokacija na čekanju te ćemo u sljedećih mjesec dana odlučiti gdje ćemo otvoriti My3Cakes prodavaonicu & radionicu. Odlučno započinjemo ovaj projekt i planiramo ga završiti do prosinca 2018. godine.
Svjesni smo da je vremenski rok malo kratak, ali već smo kontaktirali sve izvođače i arhitekte koji čekaju potvrdu lokacije kako bi radovi mogli početi. Uvjereni smo da možemo dostići cilj otvorenja do Božića, a bilo koja zakašnjenja u rokovima do kojih bi moglo putem doći neće utjecati na naše pokrovitelje koji će moći prikupiti svoje nagrade čim se prodavaonica & radionica otvori.
Spremni smo suočiti se s mnoštvo rizika i izazova koji će doći s otvaranjem prodajnog prostora, ali vjerujemo da možemo postići sve što smo si zacrtali i otvoriti prvi My3Cakes prodavaonicu & radionicu u Zagrebu.
Učinimo svijet ljepšim, cupcake po cupcake!

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>As a group of friends who have been making craft beer using a natural method at home for over ten years, we kept hearing the same concerns when we tried to persuade others to do the same -it is too complicated, messy, time-consuming and makes poor results. <br/>We set out to develop a method as uncomplicated, jargon-free and as easy to follow as possible -without compromising quality. We wanted people to realise, especially more younger and female craft beer fans, that there is a better way to brew.</p>

<p>We wanted our kit to be convenient, practical and to have great design values. We wanted to break away from the stigma of brewing at home as the preserve of old men. After more than two years of research, sourcing and testing, speaking to many professional and amateur brewers along the way, we came up with The Kitbag Brewery</p>

<h3>Let’s get saucy ...</h3>
<p>Reo, more famously known as Uncle Reo (Snoop Doggs Uncle) is a simple man who sings like an angel and spreads his love of family, friends and gospel through his passion of cooking.</p>
<p>My name is Lisa Jolly and I met Reo last year in Inglewood Los Angeles, funny story ..I met him on a park bench after I had been for a run! We got talking and before I knew it Reo had invited me to Snoop Doggs House for a family BBQ! </p>

<p>Who would know a girl from New Zealand would end up at Snoop Doggs house for a family BBQ!  </p>
<p>Anyway, I went by myself, very scared actually and Reo met me at the gate, Reos family and friends and Snoop embraced my company and we spent time around the grill laughing, singing and sharing Reos heavenly cooking and sauce!!!!  </p>
<p>Reo was still very emotional about his beloved restaurant burning to the ground, as it was a fresh situation at that time, so after many chicken wings, ribs and sauce I piped up the courage to tell him we should bottle this sauce, sell it and get this restaurant up and running again ...so here we are!</p>

<p><b>We need to ...</b></p>
<p>- Sell 10000 bottles of Reos Mississippi Sauce</p>
<p><strong>This will mean ...</strong></p>

<p>- Uncle Reo can purchase a new walk refrigerator for the restaurant, contribute to the steal metal frames for the structure of the restaurant as now required by the city.</p>
<p>- Reo can sing happy songs instead of sad songs and make more sauce.</p>
<p>- Myra, Reos business partner in the restaurant can stop using the grill at her house, and stop worrying about the wages which are still being paid, even though the restaurant rebuild is 6 months behind schedule.</p>

<p>Nous nous sommes aussi entourés de mentors, entre autres Marcus Sahou, chef et propriétaire du Foiegwa, qui s'intéresse à notre projet et veut nous épauler. Ces mentors sauront nous guider et nous conseiller tout au long de cette grande aventure. </p>
<p><strong>Résumé du projet</strong></p>
<p>La Cuillère Gourmande est un service de traiteur qui s’inspire de la cuisine haïtienne pour son menu, tout en tenant compte de l'évolution des goûts : certains plats sans porc, végétariens ou végétaliens pour les clients qui le désirent, ainsi que cuisine totalement sans GMS.</p>
<p>La Cuillère Gourmande a débuté le 28 novembre 2015 avec la livraison à domicile de plats cuisinés, à laquelle s'est ajouté un service de traiteur pour des événements culturels ou autres.</p>
<p>Depuis 2015, notre service de traiteur a été choisi pour de nombreux événements (dont le festival de films Massimadi, la Fête des familles de Mercier, etc.). De plus, nous vendons certains produits  comme le pikliz, la crémasse (auquel on n'a qu'à ajouter l'alcool), la chiquetaille et la  marinade «tout trempé», des classiques de la cuisine haïtienne. </p>
<p>En 2018, l'équipe désire aller plus loin dans son projet en louant un espace commercial sur le Plateau pour y tenir un restaurant ayant une salle à manger de 20 à 30 personnes, un permis d’alcool et, si possible, une terrasse. [Mise à jour: nous opterons non pas pour un restaurant, mais plutôt pour un comptoir, dans un premier temps.] </p>
<p>En ce moment, nous sommes en campagne de financement pour diverses raisons, dont les suivantes: </p>
<p>• acheter de l'équipement de cuisine (poêle au gaz, friteuses, frigos, comptoirs, vaisselle et instruments divers);</p>
<p>• payer les premiers mois de loyer et les premières taxes commerciales associées au local; </p>
<p>• payer les denrées et rémunérer les employées pendant les premiers mois, jusqu'à ce que le restaurant soit davantage connu et qu'une clientèle soit établie. </p>
<p>Pour amasser des fonds, nous effectuons, en plus de cette campagne de financement participatif sur indiegogo, les démarches suivantes: </p>
<p>• Participation au concours Portes ouvertes sur Saint-Denis (possibilité d'obtenir une bourse de 10 000$ à 25 000$), où nous avons réussi à accéder à la deuxième étape [mise à jour: nous n'avons pas obtenu de bourse, mais nous allons bien sûr continuer à faire avancer notre projet]; </p>
<p>• Démarches auprès de différents organismes, comme le SAJE, la JCCH, la Fondation du maire pour la jeunesse (bourses pour les jeunes artistes et entrepreneurs), diverses associations d’entrepreneurs du Québec, la BDC et Futurpreneur Canada (anciennement FCJE).</p>
<p>Bref, nous faisons tout ce que nous pouvons pour obtenir du soutien financier pour notre projet. </p>
<p><strong>Contreparties</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vous pouvez faire des dons de n'importe quel montant, sans associer votre don à une «contrepartie» (en cliquant sur le carré rose où il est inscrit «Soutenez ce projet», juste à droite du bas de la première photo). </strong>Cependant, pour remercier les personnes qui font des dons un peu plus substantiels, nous offrons des contreparties:</p>
<p>à partir d'un don de 100 $, vous recevrez un panier-cadeau contenant du pikliz, de la chiquetaille et de la marinade tout trempé;</p>
<p>à partir d'un don de 500 $, nous vous donnerons un panier-cadeau contenant les trois produits mentionnés et une bouteille de crémasse;</p>
<p>à partir d'un don de 1000 $, vous obtiendrez le panier avec les trois produits, la crémasse et un repas pour deux personnes (entrées, plat principal, dessert et deux consommations).</p>
<p><strong>Si jamais l'objectif n'était pas atteint...</strong></p>
<p>Nous avons choisi une campagne «flexible», ce qui fait que nous recevrons les dons, que l'objectif soit atteint ou non (contrairement à ce qui arrive dans les campagnes «fixes»). De plus, nous allons continuer les démarches pour trouver des investisseurs et des partenaires pour réaliser notre grand rêve.</p>
<p>Nous croyons réellement en notre projet et nous espérons que vous y croirez aussi! </p>

La Cuillère Gourmande est un service de traiteur qui s’inspire de la cuisine haïtienne pour son menu, tout en tenant compte de l'évolution des goûts : certains plats sans porc, végétariens ou végétaliens pour les clients qui le désirent, ainsi que cuisine totalement sans GMS.
La Cuillère Gourmande a débuté le 28 novembre 2015 avec la livraison à domicile de plats cuisinés, à laquelle s'est ajouté un service de traiteur pour des événements culturels ou autres.
Depuis 2015, notre service de traiteur a été choisi pour de nombreux événements (dont le festival de films Massimadi, la Fête des familles de Mercier, etc.). De plus, nous vendons certains produits  comme le pikliz, la crémasse (auquel on n'a qu'à ajouter l'alcool), la chiquetaille et la  marinade «tout trempé», des classiques de la cuisine haïtienne. 
En 2018, l'équipe désire aller plus loin dans son projet en louant un espace commercial sur le Plateau pour y tenir un restaurant ayant une salle à manger de 20 à 30 personnes, un permis d’alcool et, si possible, une terrasse. [Mise à jour: nous opterons non pas pour un restaurant, mais plutôt pour un comptoir, dans un premier temps.] 
En ce moment, nous sommes en campagne de financement pour diverses raisons, dont les suivantes: 
• acheter de l'équipement de cuisine (poêle au gaz, friteuses, frigos, comptoirs, vaisselle et instruments divers);
• payer les premiers mois de loyer et les premières taxes commerciales associées au local; 
• payer les denrées et rémunérer les employées pendant les premiers mois, jusqu'à ce que le restaurant soit davantage connu et qu'une clientèle soit établie. 
Pour amasser des fonds, nous effectuons, en plus de cette campagne de financement participatif sur indiegogo, les démarches suivantes: 
• Participation au concours Portes ouvertes sur Saint-Denis (possibilité d'obtenir une bourse de 10 000$ à 25 000$), où nous avons réussi à accéder à la deuxième étape [mise à jour: nous n'avons pas obtenu de bourse, mais nous allons bien sûr continuer à faire avancer notre projet]; 
• Démarches auprès de différents organismes, comme le SAJE, la JCCH, la Fondation du maire pour la jeunesse (bourses pour les jeunes artistes et entrepreneurs), diverses associations d’entrepreneurs du Québec, la BDC et Futurpreneur Canada (anciennement FCJE).
Bref, nous faisons tout ce que nous pouvons pour obtenir du soutien financier pour notre projet. 
Contreparties
Vous pouvez faire des dons de n'importe quel montant, sans associer votre don à une «contrepartie» (en cliquant sur le carré rose où il est inscrit «Soutenez ce projet», juste à droite du bas de la première photo). Cependant, pour remercier les personnes qui font des dons un peu plus substantiels, nous offrons des contreparties:
à partir d'un don de 100 $, vous recevrez un panier-cadeau contenant du pikliz, de la chiquetaille et de la marinade tout trempé;
à partir d'un don de 500 $, nous vous donnerons un panier-cadeau contenant les trois produits mentionnés et une bouteille de crémasse;
à partir d'un don de 1000 $, vous obtiendrez le panier avec les trois produits, la crémasse et un repas pour deux personnes (entrées, plat principal, dessert et deux consommations).
Si jamais l'objectif n'était pas atteint...
Nous avons choisi une campagne «flexible», ce qui fait que nous recevrons les dons, que l'objectif soit atteint ou non (contrairement à ce qui arrive dans les campagnes «fixes»). De plus, nous allons continuer les démarches pour trouver des investisseurs et des partenaires pour réaliser notre grand rêve.
Nous croyons réellement en notre projet et nous espérons que vous y croirez aussi!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Why bees?</strong></h2>
<p>Since I (Ervin) was a little boy, I always liked bees and honey. Years ago, I began my own honey business. During the process I became fascinated with how bees work and live. They taught me many useful things.</p>
<p>When I came to Matteson a year ago, I saw they did not have bees and thought ""how nice it would be to begin beekeeping here as well"". As I shared this project with my classmates and staff, Nenad and Sonja where very eager to join and help, and as the project developed they became more and more fascinated about the project and exited to work in it. When we presented it to the school comittee, they where very positive about the idea. They encouraged us to get started and assured us of their support.</p>
<p>Why would it be so good to have bees at Maatteson? Here are five reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Honey production</strong><br/>The most obsious reason is honey. The honey produced is not only beneficial for us, but will also be sold to other people and in that way produce income.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pollination</strong></p>
<p>60% of all the fruits and vegetables we consume are produces because bees travel form flower to flower, pollinating them as they go. If bees go extinct, we might soon join them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Practical experience</strong></p>
<p>Some of my fellow students will be assisting us with the project. In this way they will also learn how to handle the bees. Beekeeping is a skill that will be able to use wherever they/we may be called to serve in the future. For full-time missionaries in self-supporting ministries, this skill will prove invaluable in reducing food costs and generating revenue.</p>
<p><strong>4. Object Lessons</strong></p>
<p>God has implanted important spiritual lessons in His creation. Bees are not an exception. Bees are magnificent.Think of the following examples listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Industrious</u> - Bees are always working</li>
<li>
<u>Clean</u> - Bees are tidy and orderly</li>
<li>
<u>Loyal</u> - Bees follow the rules of the hive, and work in harmony</li>
<li>
<u>Unselfish</u> - Bees give their lives for a common cause</li>
<li>
<u>Democratic</u> - There is a leader (queen), but the supreme power rests in the workers</li>
<li>
<u>Cooperative</u> - 12 bees work their whole lifes to produce a single teaspoon of honey</li>
<li>
<u>Development</u> - As the bee grows, it takes bigger responsabilities.</li>
<li>
<u>procreative</u> - When the bee population exceedes capacity,  group of workers leaves the hive to form a new one somwhere else.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>​5. Contact with local community</strong></p>
<p>Selling honey will bring us into closer contact with the local community so we can reach more people.</p>
<p> For these five reasons, we are very eager to have bees.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Startup costs</strong></h3>
<p>We shall begin with four hives. The following is a list of our needs and costs </p>

</li>
<li>Harvesting material- <u>220 Euros</u>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Mike D's BBQ just celebrated 5 full years of being in business! What started as owner Mike D making sauces and rubs for large cookouts and being encouraged by friends and family has grown from startup into being ready for the next phase. Over the last 5 years, Mike D's BBQ has launched 4 products, grown from self producing the dry rubs to having them produced at a larger scale along with our BBQ sauces. We have shipped products to all 50 states and 4 countries, and have products in 9 independently owned stores across North Carolina. We have partnered with BBQ cook teams who have won several top 10 finishes using our products, and have won awards for each of our products including a World Champion, a Grand Champion, and best in state two years in a row. Additionally, we've had 3 other top 3 in the world finishes.  As we enter year 6, it is time for us to take the next phase of growth. Mike D has long been fond of General Stores (probably stems from his love of old western films), and wanting to combine that with a BBQ Supply Store.</p>
<p>For people who love to grill and BBQ, the most common place to go and get what you need requires a trip to a big box store where the employees just see grills and smokers as another tool in the store. They are not passionate about BBQ and the art of grilling and smoking food. We believe it would be so much better to get all your outdoor cooking needs from a store owned and run by someone who lives for BBQ. We believe it would be a much more fulfilling experience for everyone! In addition to the BBQ items, we want to focus on other products by minority and woman owned businesses across North Carolina!  That is the next phase for our company and we couldn't be more excited about it!</p>
<p>We love Durham, NC, and have loved it since moving here in December of 2007. The Bull City continues to grow in reputation for a foodie city, and we want to make our mark there as a go to destination for all things BBQ!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The total cost of getting Mike D's BBQ Supply and General store ready is an estimated $40,000.  Our goal through this campaign is to raise $25,000 to add to the already committed funds. Until we are able to finalize the location, it will be too hard to lock down the cost for the build-out. As a result, we are focusing on locations that do not need to be fixed up so we can focus on the fitting it to our needs instead of a complete build-out. </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of how we are budgeting the $40,000 for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Construction - $18,000</strong> - We met with contractors who understand our vision for the space and as long as the location is in good condition believe the cost will be $15,000, to ensure room for unknown variables, we are budgeting at a higher number.:</li>
<li>
<strong>Inventory/Equipment - $15,000</strong> - To have a complete BBQ supply and General Store we need inventory. We will feature our award winning line of BBQ Sauces and Seasonings, but will also focus on featuring other products from minority and woman owned businesses in North Carolina to fill out our inventory. There will be grills, smokers, grill tools, charcaol, wood, pellets, and assortment of other grilling/smoking essentials. Additionally, there will be drinks, snacks, and other General Store items.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reserve Fund - $7,000 - </strong>Since we know we cannot predict everything, we are budgeting this reserve fund to cover any unexpected costs with construction and inventory. If this fund is not needed, these budgeted monies will be used as a capital reserve fund for operations purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will be disbursed across these line items. If we don't reach our entire goal of $25,000 through this effort, the funds raised will still be used for these line items. We will adjust construction and inventory costs to ensure that we still achieve our goals with the store and will continue to work to raise additional funds. </p>
<p>Perks:</p>
<p>We want to be able to give you something as a thanks for supporting us. Here is a breakdown of what we are offering:</p>
<p><strong>$10 - Thank You </strong>- A handwritten thank you letter from the owner Mike D, and public thank you on social media if you are okay with your name being public and a code for 15% off your online order or in store once it opens.</p>
<p><strong>$25 - Wall of Fame</strong> - In addition to the perks from the Thank You level, you will also get your name on the Wall of Fame in our store. We want everyone who visits to be able to see who helped make it a reality!</p>
<p><strong>$75 - Brand Ambassador</strong> - All of previous perks plus a t-shirt featuring our brand and slogan!</p>
<p><strong>$125 - Grill Master</strong> - All of previous perks plus an apron and a pig shaped bottle opener! handcrafted in Benson, NC!</p>
<p><strong>$300 - Smoke Master</strong> - All of previous perks plus 6 bottles of BBQ Sauce and 6 bottles of dry rub and you choose the breakdown of products!</p>
<p><strong>$600 - Feast Master</strong> - All of previous perks plus a BBQ feast for 4 adults prepared by Mike D himself! Depending on how far outside of North Carolina you live modifications of how this is achieved can be discussed!</p>
<p><strong>$2,000 - Own the Aisle</strong> - All of the previous perks plus you get your name over a section of the store - for example BBQ Supplies Sponsored by [insert name here]!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a small growing business, access to capital has been challenging and expensive. Your support makes this a viable project. Without it, it may take us several more years to build the business profile needed to acquire the capital needed for a project like this! Mike D's BBQ is nothing without our customers, they have gotten us this far. We are nothing without the support of our community who helped us launch 5 years ago and expand our products 3 years ago. Without that support we would not be here, and without it, we cannot get to the next phase of our business! We can truly say that without your support this dream would not be a reality at this stage.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finding a location - since we have not secured the location and are actively looking there is a risk that we can't find a suitable location in Durham. If this is the case we will expand our search to the greater Triangle Area</li>
<li>Condition of location - If the location is in bad shape and the cost to repair and then customize could be too great for our proposed budget and put the project at risk. To address this we will focus on good condition locations to minimize this risk</li>
<li>Unsustainable Sales - While the business has had steady growth each year, having a physical location can be challenging. It comes with increased expenses and if the store concept is not enough to draw people to the location then the store risks failing once opened</li>
</ul>
<p>We are working hard to minimize all of these risks and challenges and will provide constant updates to where we are in the process. We know it is important for our community who is investing in us to know where we are each step of the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>At Mike D's BBQ, we know that we all have very different financial situations. While making a monetary contribution may work for some (and we hope it does), there are those who can't but still want to support. If you can't make a contribution, the best way to support us is to use the Indiegogo sharing tools to spread the word about our campaign to all of your networks. Helping to spread the word is a vital part of making this campaign a success and we will be very grateful for all those who support us in that way!</p>

<p>When I moved to Brooklyn, New York in 2004, I started making vegan kimchi using my original recipe. It came out great! I received wonderful reviews from many people. From then on, I started selling small batches in glass jars. I also held a workshop on how to make vegan kimchi for people that were interested in making it at home.</p>
<p>I am a mother of two beautiful boys. I love my family and friends very much. I am a Yoga practitioner, Reiki healer and I meditate daily. I love the beach, and of course, I am a fermented-food lover.</p>
<p>My desire is to live a sustainable life. I am always thinking of ways to protect the environment. I want to create something that is not only good for the community, but for generations to come.</p>

<p>Happy Vegan Kimchi is made with fresh, local organic fruits and vegetables. It tastes fresh, crunchy, spicy and sour. The taste is addicting.</p>
<p>It makes a perfect side dish. Eat it with rice, use it as a topping on a green salad with avocado, put it inside of a grilled cheese sandwich… Vegan kimchi tastes delicious with anything that’s on your plate.</p>
<p>It doesn’t taste fishy like most kimchis because we don’t use fish sauce, nor do we use white sugar (regular kimchi uses both of these ingredients). If you don’t enjoy the fishy smell or taste of kimchi, then our Happy Vegan Kimchi is the right choice for you.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558326133/lpfiusfqhztbebgjjwwt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Because of the fermentation process, it is spicy and sour.  This process produces live and active “probiotic cultures”, which is the key to all of the health benefits that Kimchi has to offer. The health benefits include promoting digestion, boosting the immune system, regulating cholesterol and so much more. The longer the kimchi ferments, the more potent the health benefits become, and it becomes tastier too. In Asian countries, longer fermented kimchi is called “natural medicine”.</p>

<p><strong>＜発酵と自分の歴史＞</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>日本で生まれ育った私は、小さい頃から発酵した食べ物が大好きでした。味噌や漬物、梅干しを祖母や母が手作りしているのをいつも近くで見ていました。冬になると新潟の酒蔵の親戚から送られてくる酒粕、箱を開けた時に芳しい香り、それを湯に溶かして祖母が作ってくれる暖かい飲み物がとても楽しみでした。</p>
<p>大人になり一人で生活するようになると、発酵食品を自分で手作りするのは私にとって自然なことでした。2004年にアメリカに移住してからは、さらに日本古来の発酵食品や調味料を大切に考えるようになりました。また、子供を持つようになると、店で売っている漬物や調味料に添加物がたくさん入っていること、自然な日本古来の発酵の味を食べさせてあげたい、という思いから、さらにたくさんの発酵食品や調味料を手作りするようになりました。</p>
<p>私のこれまでは発酵食品なしでは語れないほどです。その中でも、オリジナルレシピを考案してニューヨークで作り始めたビーガンキムチに夢中になりました。どんな人種の方でも美味しく食べられるように、野菜と果物だけでキムチを作りたかったのです。毎日のように醸し、発酵の瓶が所狭しと並べられていて、まるで実験室のような私のキッチンでした。ビーガンキムチは美味しく完成し、たくさんの人々に食べていただけるようになりました。作ったキムチを販売するだけではなく、ワークショップを開き、キムチニャンミョン から作り方を教えていました。ハッピービーガンキムチは私と人々を繋げて、ハッピーの輪が大きくなっていきました。</p>
<p>地元で採れる野菜や果物でビーガンキムチを醸し、それを日常的に美味しく食す。そのシンプルな食習慣と、体により良い循環。それを世界中に広げていきたいと思っています。</p>
<p>ハワイではマンゴーやパパイヤが熟れて木から落ちている光景によく出会います。溢れるように存在するローカルフルーツたちを美味しいビーガンキムチに変身させるのが私の役目の一つです。ハワイのエネルギーがたっぷり入ったハワイアン・ビーガンキムチが新しく新登場する予定です。</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>＜将来的にハワイで発酵蔵を作りたい夢＞</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>日本には古来から存在する味噌や醤油を貯蔵しておく発酵蔵。地域のみんなで仕込んだ味噌や醤油などがそこで時間をかけて発酵していく、古くからある日本の発酵の文化は素晴らしいです。その蔵の存在に憧れて色々と調べているうちに、日本の食文化が残るハワイにこの発酵蔵を創りたいと思うに至りました。</p>
<p>このハッピービーガンキムチのプロジェクトは、将来的にハワイに発酵蔵を創りたい夢への第一歩です。</p>
<p>ご支援、ご協力を是非ともよろしくお願いします。 そしてその発酵蔵を一緒に育てる仲間になってください。どうもありがとうございました。</p>

My name is Yuko, I was born in Japan and I found my passion for fermented food when I was little. I used to work at a hospital as an RN and “Western medicine” is not the only answer to cure people’s health; I realized only what people choose to eat everyday can help them. The fermented food was my answer for people’s health and I found out that vegan kimchi is a very powerful solution among all the fermented foods. 
When I moved to Brooklyn, New York in 2004, I started making vegan kimchi using my original recipe. It came out great! I received wonderful reviews from many people. From then on, I started selling small batches in glass jars. I also held a workshop on how to make vegan kimchi for people that were interested in making it at home.
I am a mother of two beautiful boys. I love my family and friends very much. I am a Yoga practitioner, Reiki healer and I meditate daily. I love the beach, and of course, I am a fermented-food lover.
My desire is to live a sustainable life. I am always thinking of ways to protect the environment. I want to create something that is not only good for the community, but for generations to come.
 




Happy Vegan Kimchi is made with fresh, local organic fruits and vegetables. It tastes fresh, crunchy, spicy and sour. The taste is addicting.
It makes a perfect side dish. Eat it with rice, use it as a topping on a green salad with avocado, put it inside of a grilled cheese sandwich… Vegan kimchi tastes delicious with anything that’s on your plate.
It doesn’t taste fishy like most kimchis because we don’t use fish sauce, nor do we use white sugar (regular kimchi uses both of these ingredients). If you don’t enjoy the fishy smell or taste of kimchi, then our Happy Vegan Kimchi is the right choice for you.

The health benefits include promoting digestion, boosting the immune system, regulating cholesterol and so much more. The longer the kimchi ferments, the more potent the health benefits become, and it becomes tastier too. In Asian countries, longer fermented kimchi is called “natural medicine”.

大人になり一人で生活するようになると、発酵食品を自分で手作りするのは私にとって自然なことでした。2004年にアメリカに移住してからは、さらに日本古来の発酵食品や調味料を大切に考えるようになりました。また、子供を持つようになると、店で売っている漬物や調味料に添加物がたくさん入っていること、自然な日本古来の発酵の味を食べさせてあげたい、という思いから、さらにたくさんの発酵食品や調味料を手作りするようになりました。
私のこれまでは発酵食品なしでは語れないほどです。その中でも、オリジナルレシピを考案してニューヨークで作り始めたビーガンキムチに夢中になりました。どんな人種の方でも美味しく食べられるように、野菜と果物だけでキムチを作りたかったのです。毎日のように醸し、発酵の瓶が所狭しと並べられていて、まるで実験室のような私のキッチンでした。ビーガンキムチは美味しく完成し、たくさんの人々に食べていただけるようになりました。作ったキムチを販売するだけではなく、ワークショップを開き、キムチニャンミョン から作り方を教えていました。ハッピービーガンキムチは私と人々を繋げて、ハッピーの輪が大きくなっていきました。
地元で採れる野菜や果物でビーガンキムチを醸し、それを日常的に美味しく食す。そのシンプルな食習慣と、体により良い循環。それを世界中に広げていきたいと思っています。
ハワイではマンゴーやパパイヤが熟れて木から落ちている光景によく出会います。溢れるように存在するローカルフルーツたちを美味しいビーガンキムチに変身させるのが私の役目の一つです。ハワイのエネルギーがたっぷり入ったハワイアン・ビーガンキムチが新しく新登場する予定です。
 
＜将来的にハワイで発酵蔵を作りたい夢＞
 
日本には古来から存在する味噌や醤油を貯蔵しておく発酵蔵。地域のみんなで仕込んだ味噌や醤油などがそこで時間をかけて発酵していく、古くからある日本の発酵の文化は素晴らしいです。その蔵の存在に憧れて色々と調べているうちに、日本の食文化が残るハワイにこの発酵蔵を創りたいと思うに至りました。
このハッピービーガンキムチのプロジェクトは、将来的にハワイに発酵蔵を創りたい夢への第一歩です。
ご支援、ご協力を是非ともよろしくお願いします。 そしてその発酵蔵を一緒に育てる仲間になってください。どうもありがとうございました。

Although we didn't hit the target we were after, we've had enough orders to reach the minimums to buy our coffee and sustainable bags. WE'RE LIVE! So thank you so much for getting us off the ground, the team couldn't be anymore grateful!  If you would like to order some coffee and support our sustainable coffee movement - please buy a bag here: CommunityBeanCoffee.com.auWelcome to Community Bean Coffee.The hamster wheel is live right  here!! All orders get a shout out while we grind away. We know it's going to be a slow grind  (literally) but we won't stop until we reach our goal! We need to start giving a flying hoot about the impact our morning cup of caffeinated goodness has. At Community Bean Coffee we've bean crafted to better the environment and Australian communities. Ethically sourced, expertly roasted (by the Godfather of Australian Coffee), sustainably packaged & shipped, coffee wastage is recycled AND it won't hurt your hip pocket. Sounds too choice to be true...but it isn't. Computer says yes!  Your purchase goes towards helping us meet the minimum wholesale purchase of the ethical coffee and compostable bags. PLUS it will allow Community Bean Coffee to take up permanent residence in the Godfather's coffee factory, allowing us to kickstart into existence AND start helping the environment and communities around Australia via our Charity Partners. ....literally though.  Our founder, Nathan, is walking on a human hamster wheel grinding machine AS WE SPEAK (well, you're reading but you get the point)! Our team comprises of a small team of Coffee Lovers (coffee snobs more like it!). We're lead by: Your Coffee & Our GoalsWhat we need is $30,000 to reach our goal. This would allow us to buy the wholesale bags and bulk purchase the coffee. If we reach this goal it would also allow us to prove The Community Bean Coffee business model to our head roaster, Andrew, bringing him the security required to dedicate his limited factory space for our beans/bags and to change processes for his factory to be more sustainable. We would then be able to have Andrew on board forever, helping our cafe clients and roasting our coffee!  Next stepWe want to get this coffee in your hands ASAP!
With the delivery time of our suppliers we can get the coffee delviered the next day but the, bags and drums within 3-5 businesses days of ordering and we've negotiated an invoicing period of 30 days. 
Once our campaign is completed (and orders can no longer be retracked) we will purchase the coffee and packaging prior to our funds reaching our bank account! Risky but we want you to have your cofffee ASAP.
This means we will place our order for goods on the 14th of August
It should arrive before the 21st of August. 
The roasting and packaging process will take one day. Therefore it will be roasted on the 24th of August to be shipped on the 25th and in your hands that week! 
Wholesale Important note - Wholesale drums are Sydney only!As a Sydney based coffee roastery, we can only supply the reusable drums to Sydney based businesses. We're working on establishing roasting partners in other cities but we need to launch and start in Sydney first before we can expand nationally.

To retrace my roots and learn more about the recipes that had been passed down over generations in my family, I traveled to Northern India.The Ayurvedic up&go shot is based on a similar chain of knowledge passed down and shared to me by local Ayurveda practitioners I met whilst exploring the Himalayas. I often wondered how the farmers could work in the fields all day without taking any breaks. Their secret: a natural blend of locally grown herbs and spices. With this insight, I set out to create the Ayurvedic up&go shot. Benefits – What makes our Ayurvedic up&go shots unique? The Ayurvedic up&go shots are a blend of nine different Himalayan herbs and spices. Each ingredient contributes to a different function in the body to promote healthy energy release.  These ingredients are:

Green Tea: Provides a base rich in polyphenols, increases fat burning and increases the metabolic rate of your body.

Centella Asiatica: Rich in amino acids and phytochemicals which is required by your body cells during the release of energy. Also rejuvenates the nervous system to alleviate stress.

Cinnamon: Encourages blood flow around the body and reduces blood pressure. Improves blood sugar management and high in antioxidants.

Ginger: Aids in the management of glucose levels to combat lethargy and promote energy release. Also reduces fatigue by improving blood circulation. Additionally, it can boost your immune system!

Liquorice: Treats exhaustion. By enhancing the cortisol activity, glycyrrhizin helps to increase energy, ease stress and reduce the symptoms of ailments sensitive to cortisol levels, such as chronic fatigue syndrome.

Lemongrass: Helps detoxify the body. Lemongrass has a cooling energy which helps to soothe your stomach and keeps your digestive functions in check. 

Hibiscus Petal: Treats high blood pressure and high in antioxidants. As the antioxidants in hibiscus help to repair free radical damage, your energy levels remain high for longer!

Wild Mint: Refreshes the mind and body. Mint is a natural herb which stimulates the digestive enzymes that absorb nutrients from food and consume fat and turn it into usable energy.

Lemon and Lime Oil: Powerful antioxidant and improves mood and energy levels. Fresh squeezed lemon is one of the most well tested energy boosters around producing clean energy by hydrating and oxygenating the body to extraordinary energy and mental clarity.

Yuzu (♂) or Cranberry (♀) Extract: Added for a unique and great taste!

CRAZY RIGHT? It's the people who are crazy enough to think they can CHANGE THE WORLD who actually do. If you want FAST PLANT FOOD our business model is a high volume low margin business model where we see OUR CUSTOMERS 2-4x EVERY WEEK which is awesome because planteaters are THE BEST CUSTOMERS IN THE WORLD just ask James, Alicia and GwynethGOJIGO was born in 2014 in my CAPE TOWN KITCHEN after my second child was born. I was making 84 meals a week + spending WAY TOO MUCH TIME in my kitchen when I wanted to be doing OTHER COOL STUFF like going to my friend's farm for the weekend!So I rented a shop and sold my plant meals+snacks to surfers, secretaries and tech guys who worked nearby and EVERYBODY LOVED IT!The next year I dragged the family BACK TO CANADA to bring my dream to life and serve the exploding PLANT-EATING COMMUNITY. We opened a pop-up in an abandoned STARBUCKS in a groovy beach side town called GIBSONS but discovered the community was WAY TOO SMALL and most people preferred the processed food drive-thru's on the highway. Yikes! One customer even angrily demanded 'Is there a reason you are REFUSING TO SELL CHICKEN?' I pointed out we also refused to sell cars, stationary and running shoes. She laughed + ordered our delicious summer rolls. For many people eating only plants IS A SCARY IDEA so we make it easy+fun and offer DISCOUNTS+FREE STUFF every day. In growing our BRAND the TOP 10 lessons we learned were, we need:1) towns of 30-50,000 people so 500-1000 of them will become regular GOJIGANS2) GOJIGO in densely populated places like CALIFORNIA3) closer to our plants4) reduce transport emissions5) FEED MORE PEOPLE that are hungry and ready for change. California also has:6) tons of ANIMAL LOVERS who love GOJIGO7) we DON'T put animals in our menus8) SAN FRANCISCO has one of the most progressive ZERO-WASTE urban plans + gojigo is all about that.We're even developing our own line of:9) REUSABLE+ EDIBLE packaging lines in partnership with one of the EU's coolest circular economy groups RELOOP because: 10) gojigans LOVE TO TRAVEL and need their food to GO. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3OA1s8-SI•Our vision is to become a dominant global plant based food and lifestyle brand.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started SnuggleMuffin when I was 16 years old, selling cupcakes from my locker in high school. Over the past 8 years SnuggleMuffin has grown very organically and we are now one of the leading cake companies in Glasgow, our cakes are something a little bit special and that is reflected by our amazing, loyal customers!</p>
<p>We regularly run stalls at markets and food festivals, and absolutely love getting to interact with you all and seeing your faces when you try our delicious cakes!  We love it so much in fact that we want to be able to do this every day, and so we are opening our new city centre store in Glasgow.  We have secured a prime location in Buchanan Galleries, the second largest shopping destination in the UK, but we want to do it right and make sure we make the most out of our new shop opening, so we are coming to YOU to help us fund a beautiful shop fit to show off our bakes.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for £7000 to kit out our new shop and make is super Snuggly. We'll be doing a lot of the work ourselves, but need help getting things like paint, counters, shelving, tills and those special snuggly details.  Even if we don't reach the funding goal, anything we raise will go a long way in helping us to create a place for you to come and indulge in all your favourite treats. </p>
<p>We love that you want to get involved and have come up with a whole host of rewards to thank you for being a part of the SnuggleMuffin journey.  From a copy of our recipe ebook to a lifetime supply of cake, we hope there is something there to tickle everyone's taste buds and hope that it reflects how very grateful we are for your support. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494953458/sni5g8ml4zvuicfykbeb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Why Are We Different?</h3>
<p>So you may be thinking 'there are hundreds of cake companies' and you're right.  So why are we different? All of our cakes are handcrafted right here in Glasgow by a team of committed and loyal SnuggleMuffins who are crazy passionate about what they do.  We use fresh, local ingredients and never put anything in our cakes that you wouldn't find in your own kitchen cupboard.  Our cakes never see the inside of a freezer, and because everything is made to order we can offer all kinds of weird and wonderful bakes that you might not find in other bakeries of our size. </p>
<p>We strongly believe in banishing the idea that you should feel 'guilty' for indulging in baked goods and want to encourage people to enjoy life, and cake, to the limit.</p>

Both Michael and Juliette were raised with a very serious awareness of where their food, and everything else they consumed, came from and this gave them a deep sense of ecological responsibility for what they use in this world.

<p>In May of 2015, fire caused the closure of the historic Ronsheimer building, leaving Penngrove without a place to buy staples like milk or bread. As the building lay dormant and empty, Rebecca McDowell dreamed of providing a local market and community hub in the heart of downtown Penngrove. As the building was carefully restored, Rebecca and her husband, Evan, with long time friends, Joe and Shaina Ferraro, collaborated to create the new Penngrove Market. </p>
<p>Together, this team has decades of experience in grocery stores, prepared foods and customer service. Passionate about locally-sourced ingredients and seasonal cooking, their mission is to create a neighborhood grocery store that nurtures connection with the community, the environment, local farmers and makers.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are working hard to open the market, but we need your help! To provide the delicious  prepared foods and fresh local produce our community desires, we need the tools and equipment to prepare them. The money we raise will go directly to procuring ovens, mixers, juicers, refrigeration, and shelving, that will allow us to showcase the bounty of Sonoma County.</p>
<p>One of our first big purchases was a wood-fire oven from Mugnaini, a local oven builder and one of the best in the business! With this oven in our kitchen, Chef Joe and his crew are able to make scrumptious pizzas, calzones, and roasted meats and vegetables. Have you ever tried a piadine? Piadine is wood-fired Italian flatbread and salad wrap with infinite possibilities of seasonal combinations. Lunch is on us if you contribute and choose the “T-shirt &amp; Pizza”! Or have you always wanted to learn how to cook in a wood-fired oven? Contribute and enjoy a class with Chef Joe! We’ve got all levels of contributions and prizes and we appreciate any amount you’re able to help Penngrove Market!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution to our campaign will help Penngrove Market provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>a central hub for gathering and connecting with the community</li>
<li>employment for members of the community</li>
<li>a marketplace for local farmers and artisans to share their product without having to ship it far away</li>
<li>healthy delicious foods and household necessities for people that would otherwise need to leave town to find them</li>
<li>the opportunity for money to stay within Sonoma County and improve our local economy</li>
<li>benefits to our environment by lessening the distance our food travels</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Become a Community Lender!</strong> </p>
<p>Our vision is to create a community market in the truest sense. This means that <i>everyone</i> in our community has an opportunity to make this dream a reality. In addition to our campaign, we are looking for local investors to lend capital at  competitive interest rates. This will help us fund the needed construction and infrastructure to build out the market. If you are interested in putting your money to work in a grass-roots local market, and reaping the benefits of receiving interest, alongside building an asset for our community, we invite you to connect with us and explore the possibilities. Contact us for more information.</p>

<p>Please help support a small expedition of Pacific Northwest farmers and farm educators headed to northern Italy in January to learn more about both production methods and culinary uses for this quintessentially Italian crop, and to bring back that information for growers, cooks and eaters.</p>
<p><strong>The Expedition</strong> is being organized and led by Italian farmer Myrtha Zierock of Foradori Winery and Farm in Mezzolombardo, Italy, and Lane Selman of the Culinary Breeding Network in Portland, Oregon. We will visit production farms, seed companies and radicchio breeders throughout the Veneto region for five days. The expedition will culminate in a public event and radicchio celebration called Giàz (meaning ‘ice’ in the Trentino dialect) at Foradori.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes will include</strong> articles, photographs, video and presentations for the public, all focused on increasing understanding of radicchio production and culinary usage. Information will be shared at the third annual Sagra di Radicchio event in Seattle, WA in 2020 which we hope to expand into a multi-day conference this coming year.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship will help cover</strong> travel expenses and the development of educational materials for the primary documentarians on the trip: Lane Selman of The Culinary Breeding Network, Josh Volk of Slow Hand Farm Consulting, and Shawn Linehan of Shawn Linehan Photography.</p>
<p><strong>Background - </strong>Radicchio is a cool season vegetable that originated and is still widely grown in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy, a climate of annual mean temperatures, and latitude very similar to those of the Pacific Northwest. It is a promising winter crop as it overwinters in the field and holds well in storage, providing a locally grown alternative to lettuce shipped from warmer regions during the colder months. Numerous farmers in Oregon and Washington are interested in growing radicchio, but have production questions on variety selection, seeding and transplanting timing, cultivation, harvest, forcing techniques and storage. Little of this detailed information is available in the US and the best way to acquire details by directly visiting the farmers growing these crops in Italy. An initial visit to radicchio seed breeders in 2014 was an invaluable introduction to many basics practices that were not commonly known in the US and this second trip will build on that information by visiting more growers in the region and documenting their practices.</p>
<p>According to growers in the northwest and northeastern US, radicchio demand has increased exponentially over the past decade and recent years. Local Roots Farm in Duvall, WA has reported a 900% increase over the last decade and a doubling in sales in the past year alone. Radicchio sales currently account for 12% of their total annual sales to restaurants, and they expect that growth to continue. Hayshaker Farm in Walla Walla, WA have seen sales increase 250% from 2017 to 2018 and they also see demand continuing to grow.</p>
<p>On the East coast, Kitchen Garden Farm in western Massachusetts has doubled sales in the last year with $30,000 in radicchio sales for 2018 making the crop a significant part of the farm income, not just something novel and fun. Since 2017, Kitchen Garden Farm has been primarily selling vegetables through distributors, and directly to stores and restaurants, in NYC, Boston, and Providence. More than 60% of their 2018 radicchio was sold to NYC through Natoora and Myers Produce.</p>
<p>In the US, the California-grown, round, red Chioggia type is the most commonly found radicchio on grocery store shelves. Pacific Northwest growers are producing a much wider variety of radicchio types including Treviso Precoce, Treviso Tardivo, Castelfranco, Lusia, Verona, Rose, Puntarelle, Grumolo and more. Each has a unique appearance, flavor, texture and culinary purpose. And each have their own set of growing methods which we hope to learn more about during the “Radicchio Expedition in Veneto, Italy 2020”.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Every parent hopes their children will be happy and enjoy life. But what if something totally unexpected alters these dreams forever</i>.</strong></p>
<p>Well, that is exactly what happened one cold night in February many years ago. I kissed my very normal 2 1/2 yr old little boy good night not knowing Danny would be spending the next week in intensive care. The best guess from Danny's team of doctors was that some infection invaded his brain and destroyed lots of tissue. When Danny finally came home he was like a new born baby. He couldn't walk, sit up, hold a cup, talk, etc. He had to relearn everything.</p>
<p><strong>Ok. So now what? </strong>Like many families of children with disabilities our lives became engulfed with endless paperwork, doctor's appointments, therapy of all kinds, and a slow realization that the agencies designed to help often do not.</p>
<p>When Danny was in middle school a friend and I were thinking about job opportunities that would fit our children's abilities. We came up with some pretty crazy ideas but as special needs parents we have learned to think ""outside the box"". For me, the craziest idea was becoming a kettle corn vendor! I had never even heard of kettle corn. <strong>So in 2011 our popcorn adventure began.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533757595/eldpvdm4vmwmcwxvntii.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny loves making popcorn! </strong>Kettle corn was a great summer job but as graduation approached we wondered how we could turn Danny's love of popcorn into a lifetime opportunity. <strong>Employment for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is less than 10% </strong>so my motivation to find something that fit Danny's abilities which he would enjoy was unstoppable. By building on Danny's interests and abilities we expanded into a gourmet popcorn company ~ Poppin' Z's Gourmet Popcorn in 2014.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533758887/tkzl0gxabff5hx2w4czs.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Who knew in a few short years we would have over fifty gourmet popcorn flavors? Baconator, Caramel Cashew, Snickerdoodle, Mint Chocolate, Tuxedo, Birthday Cake, Green &amp; Gold ......(hungry yet?) </p>
<p><strong>Our business has grown</strong> to include our online store with a variety of size options plus gift ideas; popcorn buffets which are great for parties, weddings, employee appreciation; corporate gift or trade show ideas; plus fundraising which is a great way for us to support groups in our community. We have shipped popcorn from home in Green Bay, Wisconsin to Texas, from Washington state to Florida.</p>
<p>We didn't know what to expect when we started our popcorn business but as sales continue to <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533759198/qzhtrueppl42ulfjmkmh.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>grow we are able to bring this employment opportunity to other people just like Danny. In 2017 we were fortunate to<strong> hire work experience special education students</strong> from a local high school during our crazy busy holiday season. <strong>What an awesome experience for all!</strong> Since the beginning we've dreamed about employing others facing similar challenges to Danny's and are so grateful our sales allowed us to expand our workforce, even if it was only temporarily. (at least for now?)</p>
<p><strong>So again we're thinking ""outside the box"" </strong>as to how we can turn this seasonal employment for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities into a year round opportunity. Danny wouldn't have the skills the doctors said he would never acquire if not for Danny's ""team of villagers"". <strong>We believe in the power of community </strong>helping each other move forward so with help from people just like you we will be able to provide this worker focused employment opportunity for other people just like Danny. Danny thanks you for reading our story, sharing it with others and for supporting him at Poppin' Z's Gourmet Popcorn. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Thank you for helping Danny's dreams come true!</i></strong></p>

<p><strong>""Popcorn with a Purpose""</strong> is our slogan. We believe the opportunities are much more than making popcorn. As a mom of a young man who doesn't have the ability to assess harmful or dangerous situations I worry about him being alone in public spaces or under in-direct supervision. I know this concern is shared by many special needs parents as well. By providing a safe work environment with direct supervision by people who truly understand the needs of the individual <strong>the opportunity to thrive is not left to chance. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Poppin' Z's is a worker focused company which means focusing on the persons strengths and providing the necessary tools or assistance to help them become successful.</strong> Our work experience provides more than an opportunity to improve job skills but to develop friendships, self-esteem and self-worth. For many people with special needs having friends who truly accept you for who you are is a rare gift. Working in a place where others <strong>focus on what you can do</strong> rather than what you can't seems like common sense but isn't always practiced in the work place. Opportunities to develop meaningful job skills, independence, develop friendships, and to be accepted for who you are and who you want to become are a few of the ""purposes"" behind our popcorn. </p>
<p><strong>For a growing business the challenges are ever changing.</strong> We currently rent a space we <strong>""retro-fitted"" into a commercial kitchen</strong> which met our needs in the beginning, however we are quickly outgrowing. This space is in an old strip mall where any electrical or plumbing improvements can't be done to an individual space without bringing the entire building up to code which my landlord will not do.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533758035/ifdztk0ay7shyjmvphbh.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> There is <strong>only one 220 outlet in my space which means I can either pop the corn or use the caramel cooker but I can't do both.</strong>An additional 220 outlet would increase our production by allowing multiple tasks to be accomplished by workers at the same time which would decrease our costs significantly.</p>
<p>Our current space <strong>doesn't have a store front </strong>where customers can pick up their popcorn in a <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533757922/fa0ydoa8ptl0akbfsnlu.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>clean pleasant entrance rather than our current shared creepy back alley entrance. The space is <strong>not handicapped accessible</strong> which again the landlord can't correct without correcting the whole building. A store front type entrance would provide a business address for mail delivery and UPS pick ups, plus an identifiable location for social media.</p>
<p><strong>We are simply outgrowing our space. </strong>When we are busy, our space is filled with workers making popcorn, labeling, packaging etc we simply do not have enough space for everyone to comfortably and safely maneuver around to complete their tasks. Our current space is 700 square feet. Our Big Dream is to have a commercial kitchen with approximately 1500 square feet. Storage space is limited to a 4 x 8 space for raw ingredients, supplies, packaging, etc., not much room for buying product in bulk. If we had more storage space we could buy raw ingredients and packaging in larger quantities which would lower our product costs. Storage for finished goods is limited as well especially during the busy holiday season. Thank heavens my business neighbor allows us to store our gift boxes on a few of his shelves during that crazy busy season.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533927163/qpbrblp0qbbxmrr8dqi9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Simply put we would like to <strong>build our own larger commercial kitchen that is handicap accessible, meets current building codes</strong> with multiple 220 outlets for our current equipment. Our new kitchen layout is more than twice our current size, provides ample work space, improves work flow, improves storage and creates a new showroom or store front. WhoHoo!!!</p>

<p><strong>We are so much more than popcorn. Popcorn with a Purpose is more than our company slogan. It is something we practice daily. </strong></p>
<p>Now I don't want to get too much into the weeds here but I feel I need to explain some of the challenges a person with a disability faces simply in finding a job. It's not easy even in today's growing economy. Employers often do not look past an individual's quirks or differences in order to take the chance in hiring that individual but don't we all have quirks and thank goodness we are all different.</p>
<p>When I started searching for options for Danny after high school and there weren't many in the area where we lived back then. I was startled by the sheltered workshops, basically the only available option in that area at that time. I didn't realize it at the time but this was a huge factor in starting our business.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've heard about some of the drawbacks for sheltered workshops - pay below minimum wage, repetitive work, lots of down time but for Danny it would provide a safe environment while developing some type of job skill in a team environment. I was cautiously optimistic back then. But something told me this was not the best option for Danny and our family so I kept looking and thinking ""outside the box"".</p>
<p>However, sheltered workshops are on the decline due to the supportive community employment movement for people with disabilities. But not everyone can be successful ""out in the community"" especially with limited supervision or no supervision. Danny couldn't but he does want to have a purpose and contribute. The National Council on Disability recommends phasing out all sheltered workshops, paying minimum wage, and believing that supported employment is not the end of a career but rather a stepping stone for greater self-sufficiency. </p>
<p><strong>Sounds promising doesn't it!</strong> However according to the Bureau of Labor Statics (2017) only 18.9% of people with any disability were employed compared to 65.7% of people without a disability. This report also stated the unemployment rate for people with any disability was 9.2% which is more than twice that of people without a disability (4.2%). This stat seemed really low to me and then I read that 8 out of 10 people with any disability are not even in the labor force compared with 3 out of 10 persons without a disability. So the stats aren't counting the majority of people with a disability who have given up on employment maybe because employers have given up on them. According to ARC Wisconsin 41% of individuals with an intellectual or developmental disability have a strong desire to be employed in a community based setting.Thankfully there are employers stepping up and these talented workers will have an opportunity for a better future.</p>
<p><strong>Some things you may not know about employing a person with an intellectual or developmental disability.</strong>(Autism, Down Syndrome, traumatic brain injury are a few diagnosis that fall into this category.) Money is usually not a driving motivator for working. Taking pride in their work whatever the task and however menial we may think that task may be. Doing that task to the best of their ability is extremely important. They are very loyal workers who like being part of something. They want to have a purpose. They want to contribute. They want to have a place where they feel welcome and appreciated. Don't we all want these things?</p>
<p>However, if they can find employment it's usually limited to part-time perhaps due to the abilities of the individual but most often it's because they will lose their government benefits if they make too much money. </p>
<p><i>Ok, that sounds reasonable.</i> But I know some individuals who can only earn $60/month before they lose their government benefits which includes health insurance. How many employers do you know who provide health insurance for very part-time workers?</p>
<p>When I first started our business I worked with the Department of Work Force Development for months which resulted in a pile of paperwork and a job coach for Danny. Great!, I thought. Well, the job coach was assigned to Danny for a month which is a typical time frame, but due to Danny's earnings limit the job coach actually worked with Danny for 3-4 hours total. <i>Think of your own job. Did you master it after 3-4 hours of training?</i></p>
<p>My guess is probably not. So why does ""the system"" expect that from people who have an intellectual disability? In fairness I could have re-applied for another session with another job coach (no guarantee Danny would have received the same coach) but the result would have been the same. The juice just wasn't worth the squeeze!</p>
<p>So now that you have a better understanding of a few of the barriers a person with a disability faces when looking for a job (and by no means have I covered everything), <strong>let's talk Poppin' Z's specifics and how we are trying to make a difference in our community for people with disabilities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Poppin' Z's is a worker focused business </strong>which means matching the worker's abilities to the task, providing any modifications like a different type of scoop or providing assistance when needed. <i>(continuous job coaching!) </i>Our workers start out at minimum wage but like any business, our sales must cover that expense. We are a for-profit company so we often do not qualify for government grants or funds (subsidies) directed toward assisting people with disabilities like a sheltered workshop or adult day service program receives. (There are some advocates who are testing the waters to see if subsidies may be part of the employment puzzle but we'll see.)We want our workers to be able to earn a living wage but are well aware of the limitations ""the current system"" places on these individuals, as well as the risk for loosing important benefits. Hopefully ""the system"" will make the needed changes but we all are familiar with the speed of government.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities to be successful</strong> are happening daily at Poppin' Z's. Not only with job skill development but the soft skills many of us struggle with. How to have a conversation with friends? Learning the give and take of a conversation. What is appropriate to talk about plus how to use your tone of voice and body language. Being part of a team. Developing friendships. Spending time with people who accept you for who you are and who you want to become. How encouraging is that in your work environment! Encouraging you to do your best. Not perfect, not fast but just your best.<strong> It is the effort that is more important than the end product. Although our end product is pretty delicious!</strong></p>
<p>Making popcorn might not be the ""dream job"" for some individuals who come through our doors but the skills they learn, the confidence in themselves and the belief that they belong will carry them well into whatever the future holds for them.</p>
<p><strong>Creating our own licensed commercial kitchen space will create:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a safe working environment specially designed around the needs of the workers.</li>
<li>allow multiple tasks to be completed by multiple individuals at the same time</li>
<li>improve productivity</li>
<li>lower overall production costs</li>
<li>improves work flow and productivity</li>
<li>reduces worker anxiety</li>
<li>increases worker happiness</li>
<li>allow raw materials and goods to be purchased in greater volume</li>
<li>supported employment (continuous job coaching)</li>
<li>provide opportunities for success</li>
</ul>
<p> In March 2018, Wisconsin passed a bill called Employee First Initiative, which basically states any publicly funded program for people with disabilities who provides services or supports outside the home shall prioritize competitive integrated employment. It's too early to tell how this will improve employment for people with disabilities but I'm not waiting for policy to catch up to the many business, like ours, who value employees who work hard, enjoy their job, just happen to have a disability and who truly make a difference!</p>

</div></div>","Every parent hopes their children will be happy and enjoy life. But what if something totally unexpected alters these dreams forever.
Well, that is exactly what happened one cold night in February many years ago. I kissed my very normal 2 1/2 yr old little boy good night not knowing Danny would be spending the next week in intensive care. The best guess from Danny's team of doctors was that some infection invaded his brain and destroyed lots of tissue. When Danny finally came home he was like a new born baby. He couldn't walk, sit up, hold a cup, talk, etc. He had to relearn everything.
Ok. So now what? Like many families of children with disabilities our lives became engulfed with endless paperwork, doctor's appointments, therapy of all kinds, and a slow realization that the agencies designed to help often do not.
When Danny was in middle school a friend and I were thinking about job opportunities that would fit our children's abilities. We came up with some pretty crazy ideas but as special needs parents we have learned to think ""outside the box"". For me, the craziest idea was becoming a kettle corn vendor! I had never even heard of kettle corn. So in 2011 our popcorn adventure began.  
Danny loves making popcorn! Kettle corn was a great summer job but as graduation approached we wondered how we could turn Danny's love of popcorn into a lifetime opportunity. Employment for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is less than 10% so my motivation to find something that fit Danny's abilities which he would enjoy was unstoppable. By building on Danny's interests and abilities we expanded into a gourmet popcorn company ~ Poppin' Z's Gourmet Popcorn in 2014.
Who knew in a few short years we would have over fifty gourmet popcorn flavors? Baconator, Caramel Cashew, Snickerdoodle, Mint Chocolate, Tuxedo, Birthday Cake, Green & Gold ......(hungry yet?) 
Our business has grown to include our online store with a variety of size options plus gift ideas; popcorn buffets which are great for parties, weddings, employee appreciation; corporate gift or trade show ideas; plus fundraising which is a great way for us to support groups in our community. We have shipped popcorn from home in Green Bay, Wisconsin to Texas, from Washington state to Florida.
We didn't know what to expect when we started our popcorn business but as sales continue to grow we are able to bring this employment opportunity to other people just like Danny. In 2017 we were fortunate to hire work experience special education students from a local high school during our crazy busy holiday season. What an awesome experience for all! Since the beginning we've dreamed about employing others facing similar challenges to Danny's and are so grateful our sales allowed us to expand our workforce, even if it was only temporarily. (at least for now?)
So again we're thinking ""outside the box"" as to how we can turn this seasonal employment for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities into a year round opportunity. Danny wouldn't have the skills the doctors said he would never acquire if not for Danny's ""team of villagers"". We believe in the power of community helping each other move forward so with help from people just like you we will be able to provide this worker focused employment opportunity for other people just like Danny. Danny thanks you for reading our story, sharing it with others and for supporting him at Poppin' Z's Gourmet Popcorn. 
Thank you for helping Danny's dreams come true!

Wow! We're were on TV!

""Popcorn with a Purpose"" is our slogan. We believe the opportunities are much more than making popcorn. As a mom of a young man who doesn't have the ability to assess harmful or dangerous situations I worry about him being alone in public spaces or under in-direct supervision. I know this concern is shared by many special needs parents as well. By providing a safe work environment with direct supervision by people who truly understand the needs of the individual the opportunity to thrive is not left to chance. 
Poppin' Z's is a worker focused company which means focusing on the persons strengths and providing the necessary tools or assistance to help them become successful. Our work experience provides more than an opportunity to improve job skills but to develop friendships, self-esteem and self-worth. For many people with special needs having friends who truly accept you for who you are is a rare gift. Working in a place where others focus on what you can do rather than what you can't seems like common sense but isn't always practiced in the work place. Opportunities to develop meaningful job skills, independence, develop friendships, and to be accepted for who you are and who you want to become are a few of the ""purposes"" behind our popcorn. 
For a growing business the challenges are ever changing. We currently rent a space we ""retro-fitted"" into a commercial kitchen which met our needs in the beginning, however we are quickly outgrowing. This space is in an old strip mall where any electrical or plumbing improvements can't be done to an individual space without bringing the entire building up to code which my landlord will not do.
 There is only one 220 outlet in my space which means I can either pop the corn or use the caramel cooker but I can't do both.An additional 220 outlet would increase our production by allowing multiple tasks to be accomplished by workers at the same time which would decrease our costs significantly.
Our current space doesn't have a store front where customers can pick up their popcorn in a clean pleasant entrance rather than our current shared creepy back alley entrance. The space is not handicapped accessible which again the landlord can't correct without correcting the whole building. A store front type entrance would provide a business address for mail delivery and UPS pick ups, plus an identifiable location for social media.
We are simply outgrowing our space. When we are busy, our space is filled with workers making popcorn, labeling, packaging etc we simply do not have enough space for everyone to comfortably and safely maneuver around to complete their tasks. Our current space is 700 square feet. Our Big Dream is to have a commercial kitchen with approximately 1500 square feet. Storage space is limited to a 4 x 8 space for raw ingredients, supplies, packaging, etc., not much room for buying product in bulk. If we had more storage space we could buy raw ingredients and packaging in larger quantities which would lower our product costs. Storage for finished goods is limited as well especially during the busy holiday season. Thank heavens my business neighbor allows us to store our gift boxes on a few of his shelves during that crazy busy season.

Simply put we would like to build our own larger commercial kitchen that is handicap accessible, meets current building codes with multiple 220 outlets for our current equipment. Our new kitchen layout is more than twice our current size, provides ample work space, improves work flow, improves storage and creates a new showroom or store front. WhoHoo!!!
Here's our preliminary kitchen design.

Here's our preliminary cost estimation.


Areas of Construction completely financed: drywall, windows,

We are so much more than popcorn. Popcorn with a Purpose is more than our company slogan. It is something we practice daily. 
Now I don't want to get too much into the weeds here but I feel I need to explain some of the challenges a person with a disability faces simply in finding a job. It's not easy even in today's growing economy. Employers often do not look past an individual's quirks or differences in order to take the chance in hiring that individual but don't we all have quirks and thank goodness we are all different.
When I started searching for options for Danny after high school and there weren't many in the area where we lived back then. I was startled by the sheltered workshops, basically the only available option in that area at that time. I didn't realize it at the time but this was a huge factor in starting our business.
I'm sure you've heard about some of the drawbacks for sheltered workshops - pay below minimum wage, repetitive work, lots of down time but for Danny it would provide a safe environment while developing some type of job skill in a team environment. I was cautiously optimistic back then. But something told me this was not the best option for Danny and our family so I kept looking and thinking ""outside the box"".
However, sheltered workshops are on the decline due to the supportive community employment movement for people with disabilities. But not everyone can be successful ""out in the community"" especially with limited supervision or no supervision. Danny couldn't but he does want to have a purpose and contribute. The National Council on Disability recommends phasing out all sheltered workshops, paying minimum wage, and believing that supported employment is not the end of a career but rather a stepping stone for greater self-sufficiency. 
Sounds promising doesn't it! However according to the Bureau of Labor Statics (2017) only 18.9% of people with any disability were employed compared to 65.7% of people without a disability. This report also stated the unemployment rate for people with any disability was 9.2% which is more than twice that of people without a disability (4.2%). This stat seemed really low to me and then I read that 8 out of 10 people with any disability are not even in the labor force compared with 3 out of 10 persons without a disability. So the stats aren't counting the majority of people with a disability who have given up on employment maybe because employers have given up on them. According to ARC Wisconsin 41% of individuals with an intellectual or developmental disability have a strong desire to be employed in a community based setting.Thankfully there are employers stepping up and these talented workers will have an opportunity for a better future.
Some things you may not know about employing a person with an intellectual or developmental disability.(Autism, Down Syndrome, traumatic brain injury are a few diagnosis that fall into this category.) Money is usually not a driving motivator for working. Taking pride in their work whatever the task and however menial we may think that task may be. Doing that task to the best of their ability is extremely important. They are very loyal workers who like being part of something. They want to have a purpose. They want to contribute. They want to have a place where they feel welcome and appreciated. Don't we all want these things?
However, if they can find employment it's usually limited to part-time perhaps due to the abilities of the individual but most often it's because they will lose their government benefits if they make too much money. 
Ok, that sounds reasonable. But I know some individuals who can only earn $60/month before they lose their government benefits which includes health insurance. How many employers do you know who provide health insurance for very part-time workers?
When I first started our business I worked with the Department of Work Force Development for months which resulted in a pile of paperwork and a job coach for Danny. Great!, I thought. Well, the job coach was assigned to Danny for a month which is a typical time frame, but due to Danny's earnings limit the job coach actually worked with Danny for 3-4 hours total. Think of your own job. Did you master it after 3-4 hours of training?
My guess is probably not. So why does ""the system"" expect that from people who have an intellectual disability? In fairness I could have re-applied for another session with another job coach (no guarantee Danny would have received the same coach) but the result would have been the same. The juice just wasn't worth the squeeze!
So now that you have a better understanding of a few of the barriers a person with a disability faces when looking for a job (and by no means have I covered everything), let's talk Poppin' Z's specifics and how we are trying to make a difference in our community for people with disabilities.

Hopefully ""the system"" will make the needed changes but we all are familiar with the speed of government.
Opportunities to be successful are happening daily at Poppin' Z's. Not only with job skill development but the soft skills many of us struggle with. How to have a conversation with friends? Learning the give and take of a conversation. What is appropriate to talk about plus how to use your tone of voice and body language. Being part of a team. Developing friendships.

<h3><strong>This is the 4th wave of coffee </strong></h3>
<p>In the last century the coffee culture around the globe changed dramatically. The <strong>3rd wave</strong> brought up quality beans with a variety of tasty flavor profiles. Independent coffee shops with baristas became the trend. Different styles of brewing were introduced or rediscovered, improving the image of a filter coffee.

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>We are three friends, Michael, Rafael and Miguel, sharing the same passion for coffee and the vision to build a better world. </p>
<p>In May 2018 we traveled to Colombia - Miguel's home country and home of the world's favorite arabica coffees. We were stunned by the prospering local coffee culture, the enthusiasm and the heart opening hospitality of the people. And we quickly realized the discrepancy between the picturesque life of a coffee farmer in our western consumer mind's imagination and the harsh reality they are facing daily.</p>
<p>We wanted to change this and started HandelsKontor Colonia.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The rising of a global coffee problem</strong></h3>
<p>While coffee is the second most traded product world wide, it is also a very controversial one. Global coffee trading aims for highly standardized coffee beans at low prices. This forces over production in the origin countries which leads to further decrease in prices and quality. The ones who suffer are the farmers and - in the long run - the consumers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0024/9272/7360/files/Days_of_labor-1.gif?2447"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The farmer's dilemma</strong></h3>
<p>Farmers are faced with rising living costs as well as the rising uncertainty of price stability for their harvested coffee. Due to over production of commodity coffee prices fall, making it nearly impossible for farmers to survive. </p>
<p>As a result, thousands of farmers gave up their business in Colombia, thus<strong> </strong>contributing to social inequality. Some are even turning to coca, the source of cocaine. </p>
<h3><strong>The coffee heritage dilemma</strong></h3>
<p>On the other hand, by giving up their farms, experience from coffee masters cultivating rare varieties of coffee is lost forever. This further contributes to the increase of commodity and blended coffees which in turn leads to further poverty in the origin countries. </p>
<p>For the consumer, this means it will become more and more difficult to enjoy rare and exclusive coffee varieties.</p>
<p>Talking to Colombian coffee farmers and roasters, we could witness this development, but we were amazed to find out that there is a way out of this vicious circle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Our Mission</strong></h2>
<p>We are sourcing <strong>unique and exceptional coffees </strong>for our customers with a focus on generating <strong>maximum value in the origin countries </strong>and creating a paradigm shift in the <strong>coffee culture</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Red Manipura</strong></h3>
<p>Working with our partners hand in hand allows us to build a strong personal network in Colombia and to find and collaborate with micro lot owners as well as experienced coffee masters who are passionate to create exceptional coffee varieties for us.</p>
<p>As an initial offering we kick start with a red honey processed coffee of the <strong>Arabica </strong>varietal <strong>Caturra</strong> - the Red Manipura. Worldwide shipping available! CO2 neutral in Germany, Add-on available for EU and rest of the world.</p>
<p>Prepared as pour over (V60/Chemex) or with the AeroPress, the coffee will have a <strong>sweet </strong>taste and bright, <strong>fruity </strong>aromas. It is never bitter and does not require sugar nor milk to be added. Preparing it with an Espresso machine (pressure of 9bar), will highlight the citrus aromas along with even stronger fruitiness and give you an intense reflection of the coffee fruit.</p>
<p>The production of honey processed coffee is more labor intense than for other coffees. Growing and processing is more delicate and mistake can easily damage the whole harvest. The drying and fermentation is risky because the coffee beans lie on raised beds for several weeks and, if not handled correctly, can rot easily. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575237081/ve1efpyaldy0bubz26tn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","This is the 4th wave of coffee 
In the last century the coffee culture around the globe changed dramatically. The 3rd wave brought up quality beans with a variety of tasty flavor profiles. Independent coffee shops with baristas became the trend. Different styles of brewing were introduced or rediscovered, improving the image of a filter coffee. Roasting became an artisan handcraft with roasters putting their fingerprint on the taste of coffee. Origin, organic coffee and direct trade became important. Check our FAQ to read more about all coffee waves.
Promises like fair trade, organic or small batch became abused by marketing and fail to deliver what is expected. Our understanding of these promises is simple, yet powerful:We cooperate directly and face to face with our small partners in Colombia.

<p><strong>The KOJIYA Company is a friends and family business handcrafting cultured rice (KOJI), using ancient Japanese methods producing a portfolio of products that promote digestive synergy for overall health and well-being. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We aim to become a household name and found in every major section of the grocery store. Currently, we are offering SUPAZAKÉ, a Pre &amp; Probiotic Smoothie, POPAZAKÉ, a Pre &amp; Probiotic kids Popsicle, and Organic KOJI. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The KOJIYA Company launched softly towards the end of this summer. With your help to meet our fundraising goal, we will take it to the next most important level by supporting and growing our current customer base and expanding new distribution. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Upon completion of our goal, we will purchase inventory from our trusted suppliers to produce 1,000 cases of SUPAZAKE. This will allow us the inventory to fill purchase orders and the working capital to hire a part-time employee and interns to help sell/support accounts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We will partner with a distributor, fulfill purchase orders and service requirements with our new and current 35 customers in the NYC area. Part-time employees hired will presell products to new and existing accounts while also adding an internship program to develop a team of 4-6 product demonstration reps to support our accounts. This support will build brand recognition and brand equity that will allow us to reach financial sustainability. </strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Wandering Café is a mobile food vending bike and catering service operating in Evanston and the North Shore area.  We use locally sourced ingredients to produce fresh, healthy street food. The Wandering Café’s chef driven menu rotates seasonally and includes a variety of vegetarian options. </p>
<p>We're committed to expanding consumer access to locally sourced food without the need to order from a restaurant. The Wandering Café is Evanston’s first chef inspired, pedal powered, mobile kitchen. Unlike food trucks, our low carbon footprint allows us to bring our product to the streets in an environmentally responsible way. </p>
<p>As a mobile food cart, The Wandering Café will operate 3 days a week, between 6-8 hours a day. The bike will have 3 rotating locations where customers can purchase our food. As a catering service, The Wandering Café will be available for private events and parties. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>In order to bring our food to the people, The Wandering Café will need $9,000 in starting capital. The owner contribution of cash and goods is 20% with the remaining 80% coming from Indiegogo crowdfunding investors.</strong></p>

With 30 high-power, sunlight-simulating LEDs and 48 low-power candlelight LEDs, the Herb Garden has the most advanced lighting system of any garden on the market. The brightness and color temperature of the lights is fully adjustable and there are millions of possible settings. On top of the light bar is an ambient light brightness sensor and ambient light color sensor. By detecting the light in the room the garden can automatically match the plant lights to match the brightness and color of the surrounding lights. Your room will always look amazing with the Herb Garden as the centerpiece.</p><p>The Herb Garden uses the latest hydroponics technology. The garden has sensors measuring water level, water flow rate, water temperature, air temperature, air relative humidity, and more. The computer uses this knowledge of the environment to care for your plants in the best possible way and will let you know if the environment changes suddenly.</p><p>The Herb Garden has a built-in WiFi micro-controller that is always connected to the internet. Your garden communicates with the mobile app so it will let you know if you need to add water, add nutrients, clean the garden, or harvest your plants.</p><p>We did not want to make another cheap, plastic garden that barely works and breaks in months. We wanted to make a garden that is durable enough to be used every day for many years and beautiful enough to be displayed in any home. We have used solid hardwood, thick clear acrylic, anodized aluminum, and other high-quality materials so that your garden will last and look amazing.</p><p> </p><h3>Why is the Herb Garden so pricey?</h3><p>We set out to make the best indoor garden in the world and we truly believe that we achieved that. From the outer wood case to the polymer lenses we have only used the absolute best materials and components every step along the way. The Herb Garden costs over $900 to manufacture using the latest technology and we wanted to charge the smallest premium possible to our customers. The Herb Garden is handmade here in our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts and each garden will go through thorough testing before leaving the plant. So you can be sure that you are receiving a world-class garden unlike anything on the market.</p></div>","How is the Herb Garden different from other indoor gardens?The answer is technology and beauty. With 30 high-power, sunlight-simulating LEDs and 48 low-power candlelight LEDs, the Herb Garden has the most advanced lighting system of any garden on the market. The brightness and color temperature of the lights is fully adjustable and there are millions of possible settings. On top of the light bar is an ambient light brightness sensor and ambient light color sensor. By detecting the light in the room the garden can automatically match the plant lights to match the brightness and color of the surrounding lights. Your room will always look amazing with the Herb Garden as the centerpiece.The Herb Garden uses the latest hydroponics technology. The garden has sensors measuring water level, water flow rate, water temperature, air temperature, air relative humidity, and more. The computer uses this knowledge of the environment to care for your plants in the best possible way and will let you know if the environment changes suddenly.The Herb Garden has a built-in WiFi micro-controller that is always connected to the internet. Your garden communicates with the mobile app so it will let you know if you need to add water, add nutrients, clean the garden, or harvest your plants.We did not want to make another cheap, plastic garden that barely works and breaks in months. We wanted to make a garden that is durable enough to be used every day for many years and beautiful enough to be displayed in any home. We have used solid hardwood, thick clear acrylic, anodized aluminum, and other high-quality materials so that your garden will last and look amazing. Why is the Herb Garden so pricey?We set out to make the best indoor garden in the world and we truly believe that we achieved that. From the outer wood case to the polymer lenses we have only used the absolute best materials and components every step along the way. The Herb Garden costs over $900 to manufacture using the latest technology and we wanted to charge the smallest premium possible to our customers. The Herb Garden is handmade here in our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts and each garden will go through thorough testing before leaving the plant. So you can be sure that you are receiving a world-class garden unlike anything on the market.",37.0,2,"1 Campaign

<span style=""color: #d21848;"">How it all began</span>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Wow, it's been five years. When I first started Red Pandora my goal was committed to using high quality, organic ingredients (rice syrup, Madagascar vanilla , unrefined coconut oil), and to strictly avoid corn syrup.</p>
<p>During that time I staged at Otom and Blackbird (Michelin star restaurants) to augment my flavor-pairing skills and threw as many supper club events as I could handle and started speaking with suppliers and building relationships with farmers. My Grandfather owned a restaurant when I was a young so I knew the importance of using high quality without taking shortcuts. Also, slow cooking was a very traditional staple in my Grandmothers and Mothers house.  With the knowledge I gathered over the years, I started making small-batches of my corn and placing it on store shelves. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447179459/ligg0wik05hxpvf9etnb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My cooking secret, really wasn't really a secret. But was a caramel making process that is similar to what confectionery chefs have used since the eighteenth century. <br/></p>
<p>By utilizing a "" back to the basics"" style of cooking,  I was able to create a caramel recipe  that didn't cook off 
the vanilla notes. Using freshly-popped  organic farm grown kernels, healthier oils and smokey bacon without nitrates also helped.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to create snack combinations that were playful and unique in flavor. I found that other caramel snacks were either too sweet, not rich in flavor and or didn't carry the complex flavors that they were meant to carry do to the process and ingredients used.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Humble Beginnings - First Packaging when Red Pandora snacks hit stores </b></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to the delicate nature of my ingredients (no preservatives or GMO's) I realized that I needed better packaging to protect my product from the elements, keep it fresher and make it last longer. I started working with manufacturers, suppliers and my designer. End the end, we came up with a foil type packaging within a cool box and traditional tins.<br/></p>

<ul> </ul> </div> </div>","How it all began


Wow, it's been five years. When I first started Red Pandora my goal was committed to using high quality, organic ingredients (rice syrup, Madagascar vanilla , unrefined coconut oil), and to strictly avoid corn syrup.
During that time I staged at Otom and Blackbird (Michelin star restaurants) to augment my flavor-pairing skills and threw as many supper club events as I could handle and started speaking with suppliers and building relationships with farmers. My Grandfather owned a restaurant when I was a young so I knew the importance of using high quality without taking shortcuts. Also, slow cooking was a very traditional staple in my Grandmothers and Mothers house.  With the knowledge I gathered over the years, I started making small-batches of my corn and placing it on store shelves. 
 




My cooking secret, really wasn't really a secret. But was a caramel making process that is similar to what confectionery chefs have used since the eighteenth century. 
By utilizing a "" back to the basics"" style of cooking,  I was able to create a caramel recipe  that didn't cook off 
the vanilla notes. Using freshly-popped  organic farm grown kernels, healthier oils and smokey bacon without nitrates also helped.

I wanted to create snack combinations that were playful and unique in flavor. I found that other caramel snacks were either too sweet, not rich in flavor and or didn't carry the complex flavors that they were meant to carry do to the process and ingredients used.

Humble Beginnings - First Packaging when Red Pandora snacks hit stores 





Due to the delicate nature of my ingredients (no preservatives or GMO's) I realized that I needed better packaging to protect my product from the elements, keep it fresher and make it last longer. I started working with manufacturers, suppliers and my designer. End the end, we came up with a foil type packaging within a cool box and traditional tins.
 New Packaging




Currently I have 5 flavors total:



Caramel Bacon Cachaca Crunch  - A caramel popcorn made with a blend of real Madagascar vanilla, Imported Brazilian Rum, Uncured smoked bacon and Organic Popcorn. A good combination of salty and sweet.



Spicy Ginger Snap Crunch  - Caramel popcorn made with Fresh Ginger, real Madagascar vanilla, Organic Popcorn and real spices



Chipotle Cheddar   - The rich velvety smooth flavor of natural cheddar, combined with the deep smoky heat of real chipotle peppers and just the right amount of olive oil.



Honey Truffled popcorn w/Apple wood Smoked Salt  - Rich caramel corn made with a sweet fragrant honey infused with real Black Summer Truffles for a balance of earthiness and sweetness.



Vanilla Cachaca Crunch  - A caramel popcorn made with a blend of real Madagascar vanilla, Cachaca Brazilian Rum, Pecans and Organic Popcorn



No GMO's
Made With Organic Ingredients

<table><tbody><tr><td><blockquote>
<p>Say Hello Sweets came to life, when Naomi began experimenting with making ice cream during a heatwave in the Summer of 2015. It was an idea that came about, as a way to fundraise for her sweet and much loved dog, Babycakes, who needed expensive surgery. </p>
<p>Ice cream tasting parties were held by donation, to help cover some of the vet bill costs. The positive feedback from friends &amp; family was truly inspiring &amp; they began asking if they could order &amp; purchase some of the delicious ice cream flavors that they were eating.</p>
<p>Then, Naomi fell in love...with creating and developing unique ice cream flavors, that is! And so it began. The vet bills began to get paid off, one pint of ice cream at a time &amp; Naomi realized, that her love of making ice cream, was getting serious!</p>
<p>With the dream of making a living producing unexpected, sometimes wacky-flavoured, yet always delicious ice cream, Naomi set about crafting a business plan and Say Hello Sweets was born.</p>
<p>Naomi sources out the highest quality, organic ingredients, from local food markets and farms, to create ice cream flavor delights like none other. The ultimate goal is to create unique recipes, that will produce creamy, delicious, luscious textured ice cream, without chemical stabilizers or artificial ingredients.</p>
<p>With a little luck and Naomi's trademark enthusiasm &amp; determination, the Say Hello Sweets ice cream truck will be hitting the streets of Vancouver this upcoming summer. Watch for Say Hello Sweets at local festivals &amp; events. Also available, will be custom ice cream themes for weddings and private functions!</p>
<p>P.S. Babycakes is doing great!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We were recently left without a home. Our shared kitchen - Pilot Works - abruptly went out of business, and in doing so left us and many other companies without a commercial kitchen to work in. We had to cancel all of our holiday markets, and are unable to fulfill our orders to our vendors.  Because of the unforeseen closure of our kitchen, we did not have enough time to catch the window of pepper produce, and more importantly, apply for a new location license and prepare for our winter stock.</p>
<p>My name is Andre Springer and I am the creator and founder of Shaquanda Will Feed You LLC.  I was born in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, of Barbadian decent and grew up in a household focused around the love for all things food. My Grandmother and I pickled peppers and made sauces together in Far Rockaway, Queens. She was a second mother to me and even though she has left this plane of existence, she still continues to be an inspiration.  As I grew older, I fell in love with creating art.  As an artist, I began investigating symbolism within the African Diaspora, creating work about found and lost objects. I studied Fine Arts at Parsons School of Design at the New School, and at the age of 20 I took on one of my first hospitality jobs - bartending - at a place called ""The Slide,"" on the Bowery in downtown Manhattan. There I met the infamous, beautiful, and incisively clever drag queen legend Linda Simpson. Shaquanda made her first appearance at Linda Simpson's weekly Gay Jeopardy event, and soon thereafter began hosting and performing for the people. As an artist, lover of food, and drag queen, I needed to make something that was most authentically me – hot sauce seemed like the natural next step.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our first step is to locate a commercial space true to our ethos. We will then be able to restart our Shaquanda production development and fun-size production runs. Storage and a place where Mizz Quanda can get her mail. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scaling is one of the most difficult transitions in a company's growth. Prior to our shared kitchen closing down, we were limited to making small batches of up to 500 bottles at a time and were having trouble fulfilling demand at that capacity. With financial help we can retain the same great quality as before and grow.</p>
<p>Shaquanda also wants to go to school, take some courses on how to be a better business person and learn the lingo of those suits so that she can be a boss, just like how Joan Crawford schooled the Pepsi guys in the board scene from the movie Mommy Dearest.</p>
<p>This financial assistance will help us develop new products, and give us time to really perfect our business. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You get all these beautiful and delicious prizes, be the envy of your friends when they know that you are in the know.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission is to be visible on shelves, for all age ranges. We want to make change for those who don't see themselves in the supermarket. Let us spread a message of love, camp, and acceptance.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Now more than ever,</strong> we need to remember the joy and excitement people feel when they are feasting on their favorite Japanese dishes. We need to stand up for smoother, easier service throughout the sector as well. This past year has been challenging for all restaurants, pushing many in the food industry into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>We are not out of the woods yet, either.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, businesses will remain in <strong>closing and reopening</strong>. Some restaurants will be able to serve food outside, offer takeout or will remain closed permanently.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, these challenges will not end anytime soon., <strong>Japanese restaurants are particularly at risk</strong> of financial difficulty. Every month, we can expect more Japanese restaurants to go under</p>
<p>So we decided to take action and solve the problems that Japanese chefs and Japanese restaurants are facing in the U.S. We have engineered a platform and a business model that encourages people to think differently about Japanese cuisine and the businesses that support it.</p>

<h2>The Short Of It</h2>
<p>Two years ago, we were five friends who thought we were in Israel for a vacation. Really, each of us responded to an invitation for an adventure much bigger than we could have imagined. Because of our passion for wine, we went in search of the best vineyards in Israel.</p>
<p>We were blown away with the quality and uniqueness of the wine we tasted and realized we wanted to share it with our friends back home. The challenge was, wine from Israel isn’t easy to find in the United States. So, we made it our mission to change that.</p>
<h3><strong>In May 2019, we launched Israeli Good Wine, a club that that brings amazing wines from the land of Israel to your door in time for your next gathering around the table.</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve spent our blood, sweat, tears, and personal capital to get the company off the ground, but now we could use your help. With this campaign, we’re aiming to accomplish some specific goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand our ability to ship into every state in the U.S. where we can legally ship direct to consumer.</li>
<li>Import new and exclusive wines from Israel and share them for the first time ever in the United States.</li>
<li>Solidify our business model as a new company.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve operated using only our own capital investments and have run as a no-debt company. We’re a lean, mean, wine-dealing machine! In order to solidify and expand our business, we’re looking to secure $32,000 in funding.</p>
<h3>Our business model is simple: we bring wine from Israel to people like you.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570813862/kz6atbf8guuus1mclqjb.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Securing this round of funding will help us to accomplish:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Expand our ability to ship into every state in the U.S. where we can legally ship direct to consumer.</strong></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Each State requires separate registration, license fees, and reporting. All of this costs money! In order to ship to your state, we need to know that there are enough of you interested in receiving our wine for us to pull the trigger on applying for the license. It's that simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Import new and exclusive wines from Israel and share them for the first time ever in the United States.</strong></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>It's not cost effective to label-approve, ship, store, or handle small quantities of wine. We need to place larger orders in order to keep the costs to you, our customer, at a reasonable level so that it's not a one-time experience, but rather you can drink Israeli Good wine as often as you would like to! We believe in operating our company as debt-free as possible, thus rather than taking out a bank loan, we would rather invite you to be a part of bringing Israeli Good Wine across the ocean so it can come directly to your door. When we can buy in larger quantities, it saves money. We are then able to pass that savings onto you, our customer.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Solidify our business model as a new company.</strong></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We've invested our own time and money for nearly two years to get this company up and running and we're not taking any money out of the company for the foreseeable future. As we grow and expand, there are basic operating expenses that a portion of this campaign will go to as we continue to solidify our business model and run as a no-debt start-up venture.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>1. As with any business, you can face unforeseen challenges. The biggest challenges that Israel faces are geopolitical in nature. Many of the wineries we work with are in what is labeled ""The West Bank"", this region is important to us because it is literally the Biblical heartland of Israel. It's where it all began! Because this is considered ""contested territory"", the ability for us to work with these wineries can be inhibited for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>2. We need to reach a certain threshold with our funding in order to meet minimum order quantities and to keep this business economically sustainable. Thus, if we are not able to make that threshold, then we won't be able to place the orders. This is why it is imperative to get the word out there to as many people as you can! Help us give others the experience of wine from Israel!</p>
<p>3. When we decided to step out and take a bold stance in aligning ourselves with Israel, we realized it would become controversial to some. Our desire is not to be controversial, but rather to be on the right side of history according to Truth.</p>
<h3>We believe in what we are doing at Israeli Good Wine. It's <u>not</u> just a business to us; it's a calling.</h3>
<p>We face the challenge of nay-sayers, critics, and many who don't believe that Israel has the right to exist. Our response to these critics is to invite everyone to come to the table, sit with us, and hear about what is ACTUALLY happening in Israel.</p>
<h3>We can truthfully say that whether you are a Jew, Muslim, Christian, Atheist, or otherwise, there is <u>nowhere</u> <u>else</u> in the Middle East that provides more freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and entrepreneurial opportunity than the State of Israel. Wine is just one of the vehicles we can employ to have this conversation.</h3>

<p>Of course contributing financially is a huge benefit to helping us reach our goals, but some people just can't contribute—and that's OK! Even if you can't opt in for one of our levels, here's a few ways that you can help us reach our goals:</p>
<h3>Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Share this on Facebook and other social media channels.</strong> The more noise, the better chance we have of reaching our goals! The share tools here are easy to use!</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't forget email and texts! </strong>These are great ways to share this with a family members or friends who would be interested in trying wine from the land of Israel or who want to participate in something fun and new!</li>
<li>
<strong>Prayers and good vibes appreciated</strong><strong>. </strong>It's no easy feat to start a business and even more difficult to start one working in the Middle East. We're so grateful for all of the prayers and well wishes we've received from family, friends, and colleagues in the early stages of this company and we'd be so honored if you care to offer prayers and support. We believe that agreement has power and we're grateful if you'd add your agreement to what we're building. Todah! (Thanks! in Hebrew).</li>

Share this on Facebook and other social media channels. The more noise, the better chance we have of reaching our goals! The share tools here are easy to use!

Don't forget email and texts! These are great ways to share this with a family members or friends who would be interested in trying wine from the land of Israel or who want to participate in something fun and new!

Prayers and good vibes appreciated. It's no easy feat to start a business and even more difficult to start one working in the Middle East. We're so grateful for all of the prayers and well wishes we've received from family, friends, and colleagues in the early stages of this company and we'd be so honored if you care to offer prayers and support. We believe that agreement has power and we're grateful if you'd add your agreement to what we're building. Todah! (Thanks! in Hebrew).

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I am a cook living in Grand Rapids, MI. I've also been vegan for over 10 years. Tempeh is always something that I've wanted to produce myself, and when I recently learned how, and made some for my local vegan underground kitchen, The Laurentian Supper Club, the response to the tempeh in particular was overwhelming. Not many restaurants in the Grand Rapids area offer tempeh on their menus, although the vegan and vegetarian population in the area is large, and growing every year. When restaurants and markets do offer tempeh, it's always one of the national brands that sources their beans from non-local sources, and have to ship their product across the country to get to our plates. I want to cut down on carbon emissions, produce a fresher product, and use the company to help support local farmers producing diverse varieties of beans and grains in the Midwest.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The process for getting a food production company up and running is daunting, and there are a lot of fees associated with getting your production facility checked out by the local health inspectors. The following are the costs that we need to cover to get the company up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li>$185 for lab testing to get the product verified for a shelf life longer than 7 days</li>
<li>$200 for two months of incubator kitchen use. That's enough to get up and running, allowing us to fund kitchen use from that point on.</li>
<li>$200 for the first six months of liability insurance for the company.</li>
<li>$50 to form an LLC that will allow the company to operate</li>
<li>$500 to build an incubator for the tempeh and have it checked out by the local health inspector</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different levels of funding, and below are some of the price points and rewards associated with them. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am a cook living in Grand Rapids, MI. I've also been vegan for over 10 years. Tempeh is always something that I've wanted to produce myself, and when I recently learned how, and made some for my local vegan underground kitchen, The Laurentian Supper Club, the response to the tempeh in particular was overwhelming. Not many restaurants in the Grand Rapids area offer tempeh on their menus, although the vegan and vegetarian population in the area is large, and growing every year. When restaurants and markets do offer tempeh, it's always one of the national brands that sources their beans from non-local sources, and have to ship their product across the country to get to our plates. I want to cut down on carbon emissions, produce a fresher product, and use the company to help support local farmers producing diverse varieties of beans and grains in the Midwest.
What We Need & What You Get
The process for getting a food production company up and running is daunting, and there are a lot of fees associated with getting your production facility checked out by the local health inspectors. The following are the costs that we need to cover to get the company up and running:

$185 for lab testing to get the product verified for a shelf life longer than 7 days
$200 for two months of incubator kitchen use. That's enough to get up and running, allowing us to fund kitchen use from that point on.
$200 for the first six months of liability insurance for the company.
$50 to form an LLC that will allow the company to operate
$500 to build an incubator for the tempeh and have it checked out by the local health inspector

There are different levels of funding, and below are some of the price points and rewards associated with them. 

$10 - A very big thank you for supporting the project when we launch
$25 - A pound of soybean tempeh, a digital book of tempeh recipes written by yours truly, and an even bigger thank you
$50 - Two pounds of Heirloom Bean tempeh, a digital book of tempeh recipes, and an equally sized thank you
$100 - Three pounds of the tempeh of your choosing, as well as the digital recipe book, a big thank you, and a cooking class if you are local
$500 - Five pounds of the tempeh of your choosing, as well as a plant-based dinner party for you and up to 10 friends using locally sourced tempeh, veggies, and grains.

The Impact
Part of the benefit of eating a more plant based diet is that it cuts down on the enormous carbon footprint that is associated with the consumption of animal protein and by-products.

<h2>Tios Hard Tea: we put the <i>tea</i> in cocktails. </h2>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615899187/pbipqs9nxponnc04j0br.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Don't miss our <strong>VIDEO</strong> at the top of the page. </p>
<p><u><strong>Early Bird offer: order your cans now and get them this April! </strong></u><strong>See pledges for UK.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tea time? Cocktail time? Why not both? </strong></p>
<p>We've created a sparkling hard tea (alcoholic tea) that combines our favourite cocktails with our love for tea for a not-so guilty pleasure. Created to be low calorie and zero sugar in three different flavours, Tios is the natural alternative to sugary, calorific, pre-mixed drinks and uninspiring hard seltzers. In our humble opinion. </p>
<p>Tios is a sparkling hard tea made with brewed organic white tea, premium spirits (tequila and white rum) and all natural flavours. It's refreshing and offers a unique depth of flavour, with a subtle hint of herbal tea that we think you'll love. It's our go-to drink for any occasion, and with your help, we hope it can become yours too!</p>
<p>We're so excited to present our Tios hard teas: the White Tea Margarita, the White Tea Mojito and the White Tea Light &amp; Stormy. </p>
<p><strong>Tios White Tea Margarita</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615280627/l4l5kywfre6sa7xytixd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is our sparkling hard tea twist on the classic Margarita cocktail made with premium tequila, a refreshing taste of lime with a hint of orange to mirror the flavours of triple sec (orange liquor, an essential ingredient in a Margarita).</p>
<p><strong>Tios White Tea Mojito </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615192967/mldugrxsqq5sidcbpboy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is our sparkling hard tea twist on the classic Mojito made with premium white rum. Minty and limey. Just the right amount.</p>
<p><strong>Tios White Tea Light &amp; Stormy</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615192991/cdw1lyf8bvch6bi7lqz5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is our sparkling hard tea twist on our favourite ginger cocktail, with premium white rum, fiery ginger and a touch of lemon.</p>
<h3>We'd love your support!</h3>
<p>We'd love your help to make Tios the go-to drink this summer and beyond. To upscale Tios production we need to raise £50,000 (see details below). </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614329524/chkvs2frdmfjgtpjc6zr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Two sisters, Cecilia and Segolenne (French/English), fiancé Mark (Danish) and a love for tea and cocktails.</p>
<p>Segolenne met Mark while working in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they both still live. In January 2020, they took 4 months off work to go on a once-in-a-lifetime trip around the world together where they discovered alcoholic teas. Their trip was cut short due to Covid-19, so it was the perfect opportunity to start their own drinks venture combining two of their favourite things, tea and cocktails. Or cocktails and tea in that order. Cecilia naturally joined the team.</p>
<p>A bit more about the Tios team's background:</p>
<p>Segolenne (29), aka 'the sassy scientist' (29) has a Masters in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Copenhagen University. She has 8 years of experience as an account manager, team leader, project manager and business operations manager. </p>
<p>Mark (27), aka 'the procurement prince', has a Masters in Supply Chain management from Cranfield University. He has worked in off-trade product placement, logistics planning, supply chain management and as global procurement manager. </p>
<p>Cecilia (28), aka 'the little marketing mermaid', has a Masters in Branding and Communication Management from Copenhagen Business School. She has experience in customer marketing and brand management for a leading global premium spirits company. </p>
<h3>Who is Tios for?</h3>
<p>Too early to get the shaker out? Fed up with the usual glass of G&amp;T? Not inspired by a hard seltzer? Tios is for the mindful pleasure-seeker, people like us who want to find a good balance in what we consume without compromising on taste. Low sugar, low calories and low alcohol content (4.4% vol) but high in flavour. </p>
<p><strong>Why 'Tios'? </strong></p>
<p>Tios (like 'Tea-ose') is inspired by our family, our travels, Danish minimalism and a British/French touch. The name inspiration comes from the Spanish 'T<strong>í</strong>os' meaning 'uncles' and is in honour of our family tradition of Margarita night, started off by our aunt and uncle.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615193019/uvxjtmnm6gqmwwttprdw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>White Tea</strong></p>
<p>Our <strong>organic </strong>white tea is brewed as the base of our drinks. White tea is our favourite because it’s <strong>rich in antioxidants </strong>and has a <strong>subtle herbal taste.</strong> It’s fresh, lightly sweet and has no bitterness.</p>
<p><strong>Premium Spirits</strong></p>
<p>Our <strong>rum </strong>and<strong> tequila</strong> are high quality spirits. The tequila (38% abv) is distilled from the agave plant in the region of Jalisco, Mexico. The white rum (40% abv) is a light rum, produced at high strength from fermented sugarcane molasses in Mauritius. Both are sourced from a UK-based supplier. </p>
<p><strong>Sweetener</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>natural blend of erythritol and stevia</strong> lightly sweeten and enhance the natural flavours of our drinks, with <strong>no calories</strong>. Stevia is derived from the leaves of the plant species <i>Stevia Rebaudiana,</i> and erythritol is made by fermenting wheat or corn-starch.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours</strong></p>
<p>Our flavours are <strong>100% natural</strong>. We use real ginger (IQF ginger), real fruit concentrates and all natural extracts including organic fresh garden mint extract and orange extract. IQF ginger is real ginger frozen to maintain its rich flavour profile and nutrients.</p>
<p><strong>Allergens</strong></p>
<p>Our products <strong>do not contain any allergens</strong> and the Tios Drinks production site is also free from allergens.</p>
<h3>Our sustainability mission </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615193098/ynnadxxym9mnhssblwun.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Our mission at Tios is sustainability with the least amount of waste without compromising on taste.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fair Trade tea</strong></p>
<p>Our white tea is <strong>ethically sourced</strong> from an approved fair trade supplier since 1994. It's organically grown in China and supplied through a UK-based compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Biodegradable tea bags</strong></p>
<p>The tea bags used to store the tea are <strong>unbleached</strong> and <strong>biodegradable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recyclable cans</strong></p>
<p>All our cans are made of <strong>100% recyclable aluminium</strong>. We chose cans as they are much lighter than bottles, meaning a greatly reduced impact on transport with less need for fuel. Aluminium is also one of the easiest materials to recycle. In Denmark, producers like us pay an annual fee for their packaging to be recycled to their return system known as “pant” run by Dansk Retursystem, a non-profit organisation. When a customer purchases a can or bottle, the letter A, B or C indicates the cost of recycling. Cans can then be returned to vending machines in most supermarkets for a refund. </p>
<p><strong>In 2019 in Denmark, 92% of cans and bottles were recycled. </strong>This is where Tios Drinks relies on you to help improve the recycling of our cans in the UK to hopefully one day reach the same target as Denmark. By recycling our cans, we can avoid mining for bauxite, the raw material used for aluminium cans.</p>
<p><strong>Minimal packaging</strong></p>
<p>It's what's inside that counts. Your unboxing experience might be a little simple but we've focused on keeping the <strong>outer packaging to a minimum</strong>. Our boxes are <strong>FSG certified</strong> (Forest Stewardship Council). The FSG aims to ensure that packaging material is made with, or contains, forest-based materials from FSC-certified forests or reclaimed sources.</p>
<p><strong>Compostable labels</strong></p>
<p>We consciously chose <strong>compostable can labels </strong>made of PLA to reduce waste and lower our carbon impact. These shrink labels are made from annually <strong>renewable plant-based sources </strong>and replace petroleum-based options for a more natural sustainable packaging. When disposed of, these films composte into safe, natural and organic substances. PLA film significantly reduces material used in packaging. It offers the highest shrink at the lowest temperature which translates to less energy used.</p>
<h3>Where are we producing Tios?</h3>
<p>Tios is produced in England near London. </p>
<h3>Where are we based? </h3>
<p>Tios Drinks HQ is based in Copenhagen, Denmark and operations and production are based in England, UK. </p>
<h3>Where can you find Tios?</h3>
<p><strong>Order a selection of Tios cans now</strong> with one of our <strong>Early Bird packages </strong>before our official launch (UK only - see pledges). </p>

<p>Tios will also be available in selected stores, cafes, restaurants and bars in England. </p>
<p>We'd love to be available in more countries and with your help we'll work hard to make that possible.

Don't miss our VIDEO at the top of the page. 
Early Bird offer: order your cans now and get them this April! See pledges for UK.
Tea time? Cocktail time? Why not both? 
We've created a sparkling hard tea (alcoholic tea) that combines our favourite cocktails with our love for tea for a not-so guilty pleasure. Created to be low calorie and zero sugar in three different flavours, Tios is the natural alternative to sugary, calorific, pre-mixed drinks and uninspiring hard seltzers. In our humble opinion. 
Tios is a sparkling hard tea made with brewed organic white tea, premium spirits (tequila and white rum) and all natural flavours. It's refreshing and offers a unique depth of flavour, with a subtle hint of herbal tea that we think you'll love. It's our go-to drink for any occasion, and with your help, we hope it can become yours too!
We're so excited to present our Tios hard teas: the White Tea Margarita, the White Tea Mojito and the White Tea Light & Stormy. 
Tios White Tea Margarita

This is our sparkling hard tea twist on the classic Margarita cocktail made with premium tequila, a refreshing taste of lime with a hint of orange to mirror the flavours of triple sec (orange liquor, an essential ingredient in a Margarita).
Tios White Tea Mojito 

This is our sparkling hard tea twist on the classic Mojito made with premium white rum. Minty and limey. Just the right amount.
Tios White Tea Light & Stormy

This is our sparkling hard tea twist on our favourite ginger cocktail, with premium white rum, fiery ginger and a touch of lemon.
We'd love your support!
We'd love your help to make Tios the go-to drink this summer and beyond. To upscale Tios production we need to raise £50,000 (see details below). 
Our Story

Two sisters, Cecilia and Segolenne (French/English), fiancé Mark (Danish) and a love for tea and cocktails.
Segolenne met Mark while working in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they both still live. In January 2020, they took 4 months off work to go on a once-in-a-lifetime trip around the world together where they discovered alcoholic teas. Their trip was cut short due to Covid-19, so it was the perfect opportunity to start their own drinks venture combining two of their favourite things, tea and cocktails. Or cocktails and tea in that order. Cecilia naturally joined the team.
A bit more about the Tios team's background:
Segolenne (29), aka 'the sassy scientist' (29) has a Masters in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Copenhagen University. She has 8 years of experience as an account manager, team leader, project manager and business operations manager. 
Mark (27), aka 'the procurement prince', has a Masters in Supply Chain management from Cranfield University. He has worked in off-trade product placement, logistics planning, supply chain management and as global procurement manager. 
Cecilia (28), aka 'the little marketing mermaid', has a Masters in Branding and Communication Management from Copenhagen Business School. She has experience in customer marketing and brand management for a leading global premium spirits company. 
Who is Tios for?
Too early to get the shaker out? Fed up with the usual glass of G&T? Not inspired by a hard seltzer? Tios is for the mindful pleasure-seeker, people like us who want to find a good balance in what we consume without compromising on taste. Low sugar, low calories and low alcohol content (4.4% vol) but high in flavour. 
Why 'Tios'? 
Tios (like 'Tea-ose') is inspired by our family, our travels, Danish minimalism and a British/French touch. The name inspiration comes from the Spanish 'Tíos' meaning 'uncles' and is in honour of our family tradition of Margarita night, started off by our aunt and uncle.

A brand you can trust

We want to be fully transparent about all the ingredients we use. And we've got nothing to hide. 
Our ingredients 

White Tea
Our organic white tea is brewed as the base of our drinks. White tea is our favourite because it’s rich in antioxidants and has a subtle herbal taste. It’s fresh, lightly sweet and has no bitterness.
Premium Spirits
Our rum and tequila are high quality spirits. The tequila (38% abv) is distilled from the agave plant in the region of Jalisco, Mexico. The white rum (40% abv) is a light rum, produced at high strength from fermented sugarcane molasses in Mauritius. Both are sourced from a UK-based supplier. 
Sweetener
A natural blend of erythritol and stevia lightly sweeten and enhance the natural flavours of our drinks, with no calories. Stevia is derived from the leaves of the plant species Stevia Rebaudiana, and erythritol is made by fermenting wheat or corn-starch.
Flavours
Our flavours are 100% natural. We use real ginger (IQF ginger), real fruit concentrates and all natural extracts including organic fresh garden mint extract and orange extract. IQF ginger is real ginger frozen to maintain its rich flavour profile and nutrients.
Allergens
Our products do not contain any allergens and the Tios Drinks production site is also free from allergens.
Our sustainability mission 

Our mission at Tios is sustainability with the least amount of waste without compromising on taste.
Fair Trade tea
Our white tea is ethically sourced from an approved fair trade supplier since 1994. It's organically grown in China and supplied through a UK-based compiler.
Biodegradable tea bags
The tea bags used to store the tea are unbleached and biodegradable.
Recyclable cans
All our cans are made of 100% recyclable aluminium. We chose cans as they are much lighter than bottles, meaning a greatly reduced impact on transport with less need for fuel. Aluminium is also one of the easiest materials to recycle. In Denmark, producers like us pay an annual fee for their packaging to be recycled to their return system known as “pant” run by Dansk Retursystem, a non-profit organisation. When a customer purchases a can or bottle, the letter A, B or C indicates the cost of recycling. Cans can then be returned to vending machines in most supermarkets for a refund. 
In 2019 in Denmark, 92% of cans and bottles were recycled. This is where Tios Drinks relies on you to help improve the recycling of our cans in the UK to hopefully one day reach the same target as Denmark. By recycling our cans, we can avoid mining for bauxite, the raw material used for aluminium cans.
Minimal packaging
It's what's inside that counts. Your unboxing experience might be a little simple but we've focused on keeping the outer packaging to a minimum. Our boxes are FSG certified (Forest Stewardship Council). The FSG aims to ensure that packaging material is made with, or contains, forest-based materials from FSC-certified forests or reclaimed sources.
Compostable labels
We consciously chose compostable can labels made of PLA to reduce waste and lower our carbon impact. These shrink labels are made from annually renewable plant-based sources and replace petroleum-based options for a more natural sustainable packaging. When disposed of, these films composte into safe, natural and organic substances. PLA film significantly reduces material used in packaging. It offers the highest shrink at the lowest temperature which translates to less energy used.
Where are we producing Tios?
Tios is produced in England near London. 
Where are we based? 
Tios Drinks HQ is based in Copenhagen, Denmark and operations and production are based in England, UK. 
Where can you find Tios?
Order a selection of Tios cans now with one of our Early Bird packages before our official launch (UK only - see pledges). 
When we officially launch, Tios will be available to purchase online in the UK and Denmark through our website www.tiosdrinks.com (see pledges available in UK and DK). 
Tios will also be available in selected stores, cafes, restaurants and bars in England. 
We'd love to be available in more countries and with your help we'll work hard to make that possible. Due to the complex alcohol-trade related taxing and customs systems specific to each country, and the fact that we are a very small team, we have chosen to focus our efforts on the UK and Denmark where we are based. But France and a few more European countries are hopefully not far behind.
Our progress so far:
Our three Tios recipes have been:

Perfected with the help of professional food scientists
Approved to be commercially produced
Tried and tested by a representative group of our target market

Raw materials have been selected from trusted suppliers. 
Can labels have been approved by national trading standards. 
Cans and packaging have been purchased.

Be the first to order cans from our first batch with our Early Bird deal (see pledges).
Why we need your help? 
The trial batch funds are already secured (Early Bird cans).
All funds from this campaign will help as described below. If we do not meet our crowdfunding target we will still be able to produce our first commercial batch with additional funding so no matter what happens you should receive your cans.

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Dave Faris. I am the founder/owner of Dave's Awesome Sauces LLC.  I founded this company after years of my friends telling me I need to start selling my sauces and salsas.  They always ask me for a jar whenever I make a batch and bug me until I do make some, sometimes bugging me because I don't make it often enough.  </p>
<p>I am currently an active duty Military Officer with nearly 15 years of active duty in the Army.  I am an UH-60 Blackhawk Helicopter Instructor Pilot.  I am creating this company now so that when I retire, I can devote my time to expanding nationally, opening a food truck franchise, and eventually my own restaurant.  </p>
<p>The first sauce I have ready from production is my Dave's Gold BBQ Sauce.  It is a South Carolina styled, mustard base, that is sweet and tangy and goes great on nearly anything.  I promise that you are going to love it.</p>
<p>You contributions will help me achieve my dreams.  I am committed to contributing 10% of my profits to feeding hungry children in America.  I want to give back to communities and help others achieve their dreams too.</p>

<h3>We Make Pleather Vegan Jerky</h3>
<p>Phoenician Micro-Kitchen is a two person operation that makes a unique and extremely tough, dry, plant-based, vegan jerky. Four years ago, we made our first batch for our personal use and shared it with friends and co-workers. Soon, we had offers from people who wanted to purchase our seitan jerky.  </p>
<p>We have been operating out of a small, shared, commercial kitchen for the past three years - and have reached our maximum capacity for the space. Interest in our product (both retail and mail order) has grown to where we are having trouble keeping up with the demand.

</div></div>","We Make Pleather Vegan Jerky
Phoenician Micro-Kitchen is a two person operation that makes a unique and extremely tough, dry, plant-based, vegan jerky. Four years ago, we made our first batch for our personal use and shared it with friends and co-workers. Soon, we had offers from people who wanted to purchase our seitan jerky.  
We have been operating out of a small, shared, commercial kitchen for the past three years - and have reached our maximum capacity for the space. Interest in our product (both retail and mail order) has grown to where we are having trouble keeping up with the demand. In response, we have secured our own commercial space so that we can expand our hours of operation and purchase specialized equipment to improve our production capabilities. 
Our plant-based jerky fills a niche for vegans, vegetarians, and anybody else seeking the tough, dry consistency of ""cowboy"" style jerky (but without the cow, of course). By contributing to this campaign, you will help us improve the plumbing and electric service to our space so that we can run high capacity, precision equipment to increase our output and quality.

<p>We're launching a waffle fusion food truck, a foundation, a scholarship and a movement. <strong>Waffle Craves</strong> is a food truck about more than <strong>real</strong> food made with real ingredients. <strong>We're about simply getting food to everyone. </strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here's the Problem</h3>
<p>There's enough food in the world for everyone, but somehow it doesn't make it to everybody. How do you get food from point ""A"" to hungry people without it getting stuck in bureaucratic indifference?  Can we do better than giving to large benevolent companies with corporate salaries where you don't know how much trickles down to the actual person in need? You have to start somewhere, with a scalable approach, taking advantage of today's technology, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">That's Where ""We"" Come In.</h3>
<p>We're Parents. Partners. Cooks. Coders. Givers. Thinkers. </p>
<p>We've won some awards for our cooking, but we aren't chefs by any stretch of the imagination; which is what  makes this so powerful. Anyone can do it. So by ""<strong>we"",</strong> we weren't just talking about ourselves; we were talking about <strong>all</strong> of us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here's What We're Going To Do</h3>
<p>We're igniting a grassroots sourced food distribution chain.</p>
<p>It sounds daunting, but there's a tiny PA restaurant that's already doing it. Their technology? A post-it note. A customer buys a $1 slice of pizza, then decides to <strong>pay it forward with food</strong> by buying another $1 slice for anyone who may need it. A note is written on a post-it and it's stuck on the wall. As the wall fills up, anyone in need can grab a post-it, present it, and eat. That simple.</p>
<p>We're taking this concept to the next level by creating an organization - not a large hefty-salaried corporation, - but simply a living and changing web source of information on how to implement <strong>Pay it Forward With Food</strong> for food trucks, restaurants and their customers. The site is complete with a downloadable seal that food trucks and restaurants can put on their websites and storefronts showing that they are <strong>Pay it Forward With Food</strong> friendly, encouraging  the revolution to spread.

<p>""Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education.""<br/>-Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>The Pay it Forward With Food scholarship/internship is a hands-on multi-week journey for one culinary student to learn how to start a business in the food industry from the ground up. The student will operate right alongside us in every facet of day to day operations. Then we'll go outside of the kitchen-classroom and help people cope with the effects of mental illness, PTSD and just plain hard times in the streets. Only in this manner can a student learn the symbiotic relationship between business and community. You ask the community to support you, but you must give back to that same community.</p>

<h3>The Pinehurst Tea Company</h3>
<p>We have over 80 years of experience in growing tea in the United States and specialize in South Carolina indigenous tea development.  Mack Fleming, Director of Tea Research for Thomas J. Lipton, assembled and evaluated thousands of tea plant varieties brought from around the world to the Thomas J. Lipton Research &amp; Laboratory Station on Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina.  Assistant horticulturist, Randall Fleming, worked for Thomas J. Lipton Research Laboratory gaining valuable knowledge on cultivating and processing teas throughout the United States while focusing on tea plant varieties already established in South Carolina. Many years were spent studying Summerville’s Pinehurst Tea Plant Variety for its dominate characteristics and taste.</p>
<p>The Fleming Family has been involved in the tea business since 1976 and have been dreaming of producing a new farm consisting of a single clone tea.  Thomas J Lipton, with Mack Fleming as Director, researched 1000's of tea clones from around the world.  After years of collecting data, only one tea plant could finish with the title of ""Clone 1.""</p>We are propagating that clone, the Pinehurst Tea Plant, descended from the Pinehurst Tea Plantation and the winner of the 1904 World’s Fair.  This is the best tasting tea researched during the Lipton Research Station years and was classified as Clone 1 for taste, growth rate, and survival rate during transplantation.<p> </p>

<p>Mack Fleming founded and was head of the Horticultural Technology Department at Trident Technical College in Charleston, SC, for eleven years.  He then became Director of Tea Research for Lipton Tea Company.  Mack served in this capacity for ten years and directed all of Lipton’s tea horticulture research domestically and internationally.  Under his direction, an experimental tea plantation was established in Mexico, and large-scale tea research and plantings were conducted on two islands in Hawaii.  His position with Lipton also required working visits to tea plantations in Kenya, Argentina, and Brazil.  He spent six years working with herbs and spices for Lipton and Unilever, Inc. in Mexico, Venezuela, and the United States.</p>
<p>In 1999, the International Science and Technology Group requested that Mack serve as the only U.S. collaborator on a project headquartered in Tbilisi, in the Republic of Georgia (former Soviet Union) to develop a mechanical tea harvester, which uses computer technology to select the proper leaves for harvesting.  In 1997, Arthur D. Little &amp; Company employed Mack to study tea plantations and factories in the Republic of Georgia, as well as to identify the best possible operations for purchase by a commercial client.</p>

<h3>Me</h3>
<p>You'll find out a lot more about how I would up doing this further down the page, but essentially I am a middle-aged -- I can no longer use 'young' as a reference to myself -- entrepreneur who is engaged in starting my own wine label and who also just built a system through which protects both producers and consumers of wine.  While my focus is wine, along the way, I wound up with both the opportunity to get into the world of extra virgin olive oil, as well as the impetus for it from one Italian associate [who is now my unofficial ""fratello""] who is involved in it from the producer's side.</p>
<h3>The Offer</h3>
<p>What I am offering is a buy in on some primo extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).  Real Italian extra virgin olive oil.  Real monocultivar (single variety) Italian extra virgin olive oil.  What this means is that each EVOO is made from one type of olive, which was grown in Italy, harvested and cold-pressed on the same day, with zero defects and an acidity level of less than 0.8%.  There are some other specifications as well.</p>
<p>This is not to be confused with things such as virgin olive oil, light olive oil, olive oil or refined olive oil; these designations in the US are not allowed in Europe at all.  This also not to be confused with products that say that they are Italian extra virgin olive oil, but might not truly be 100% extra virgin olive oil to being with, and at best are a blend of olive oils from Tunisia, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco that have been shipped to Italy and then bottled there with an Italian label.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Essentially, I am looking at a combination purchase from two different producers.  .5L bottles from one producer in Calabria and .25L bottles from another producer in Puglia.  The former has just one EVOO and the latter has six different ones.  The minimum will be one palate from one and one pallet from the other.  If enough interest is given, we can easily go up to a total of ten pallets in total.</p>
<p>The minimum needed to handle everything is $9000 (purchase of two pallets of EVOO, transport by ocean and then by truck, temporary warehouse storage, and then handling all individual packaging and shipping) and there will be three different levels: </p>
<ul>
<li>The first will give you one .5L(Calabria) and two different .25L bottles(Puglia)</li>
<li>The second will give you two .5L(Calabria) and four different .25L bottles(Puglia)</li>
<li>The third will give you three .5L(Calabria) and six different .25L bottles(Puglia)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a first level upgrade that will give you an extra .25L bottle from Puglia.  If you look at the breakdown of the different levels, and price them against quality monocultivar EVOO from other reputable Italian producers, you'll realize that you are getting a great deal.  It can easily cost you anywhere from $20 to $50 for a bottle of EVOO, and the .5L from another retailer would easily run you around $16.</p>
<p>When the olive oil is received, it will be shipped out via USPS in proper packaging.</p>
<p>If there is enough interest, we can do more than two pallets!</p>

<h3>What's Going On?</h3>
<p>We are looking to expand our operations at Dragon Distillery! Who are we? What do we do? </p>
<p>We are Frederick City's first and largest distillery - and are disabled veteran owned and operated! We are currently in our 4th year of operations - with an extensive product portfolio that includes Bourbon, Rye, and Blended Whiskies, Vodkas and Flavored Vodkas, Gins, Rums, Brandy, Moonshines, and Maryland first and original Canned Cocktails.</p>
<p>We have deep roots in the Frederick area, with the family settling here in the 1730s (so we've been here longer than Frederick).</p>
<p>With the recent change in Maryland law, we now have the opportunity to allow consumers to experience our amazing small batch spirits in a form to which they are accustomed  - that of a cocktail! </p>
<p>We've always been a bit quirky - and to compliment our Tasting Room theme - we are preparing to open a medieval themed cocktail experience! We will not only have cocktails, but lite fare AND games!!

<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>In order to bring our vision to life - we need your help. We are looking to raise at least $7,750. Specifically, funding will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase of kitchen equipment to make great lite fare.</li>
<li>Expansion expenses (including more floor drains, electrical upgrades, plumbing)</li>
<li>Purchase of bar equipment (soda lines, ice machine)</li>
<li>Dragon's Den thematic items (Shields, swords, benches)</li>

<p>If we can meet our goal - any additional funds will be used to not only enhance the above, but to also help:</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Will my contribution really help?</h3>
<p>ABSOLUTELY! Every little bit helps. What we are doing with Dragon's Den is expensive - kitchen equipment and build-out are substantial costs, but we also want to make the atomsphere something really special - and that means awesome decorations - we want heavy wooden tables, shields and weapons on the walls, all sort of medieval accessories - and all of these things add up. </p>
<p>If just our Facebook followers each gave $5, we would more than meet our goal - so every penny not only counts - but is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>The Dragon's Den is going to be a very unique place - and by helping us get there, you are part of something very special.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks, Challenges, and Rewards!</h3>
<p>First the good news! We've already acquired a number of pieces of kitchen and bar equipment for Dragon's Den - including bar and kitchen stainless steel sinks, commercial refrigeration, heating and warming units, and a number of medieval-themed decorations. But we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Before we can open - we do need to secure a number of permits. We will have build-out permitting, local liquor permitting, health-department review and approval just to name a few. We've been through this process before, so we know what to expect - but - we must get these before we can open. So - the largest risk is simply a delay in acquiring all the necessary regulatory approvals. The positive here is that the largest issue (the change in Maryland Law) has already been approved by the Maryland legislature.</p>

Everyone who donates - regardless at what level - will get an invitation to one of our soft opening parties.

<h3>Executive Chef to stars such as Beyonce, Erykah Badu, Drew Sidora, Ozzie Osbourne, Chance the Rapper, Gwen Stefani, 5th Harmony, Cold Play, Guns and Roses and more! Now caters to you!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Words To Believe In</strong></h3> <p>I remember the day my grandmother told me, ""you almost made it.""  She said this to me after giving her the news that at the tender age of 17, I was pregnant.  With tears in my eyes I responded by saying to her, ""I am going to make it and I will be somebody great"".  I believed I could do it. I had no idea how I would do it but that day, the belief was a enough to keep me focused on becoming somebody great.</p>
<p>Giving birth to my son Jonathan fueled my beliefs even more and it was after taking a cake decorating class that I discovered a potential future for myself, and my son, by becoming a culinary artist. After graduating high school, I enrolled in The Art Institute of Chicago where I earned my Associates degree in Culinary Arts and a Bachelors in Culinary Management.  While in pursuit of my degrees, I gave birth to my oldest daughter Dionne, married the father of my son with the hopes that it would strengthen our bond as a family, and worked several full time jobs to keep us afloat.</p>
<p>During the early stages of my career in the culinary industry I worked every position imaginable from a busser,  to a runner, a prep cook, a line cook, a grill cook, a lead cook, and eventually becoming a kitchen supervisor. Somewhere in between all of these job titles, I gave birth to my youngest daughter Julia and shortly there afterwards, I experienced a huge change in the structure of my family.  These events took me back to my grandmother’s words. Becoming a single mother reaffirmed my beliefs in my ability to continue to be somebody great.</p>
<p>Eleven years after becoming a pregnant high school teenager, I was given title of Chef Manager at a company who can best be described as the Rolls Royce of the catering industry. When my grandmother received this news she said to me, “I’m proud of you.  You made it. You did it.” I am not sure she remembered telling me 11 years earlier that I had almost made it, but I certainly remembered. Having my grandmother tell me that I made it was the day I felt the most accomplished in my pursuit of greatness.  It was the day that I knew believing in myself was all I needed to achieve the lifestyle I wanted for myself and my family and therefore decided it was time to run my own business.</p>
<p>Today, I find myself as a single mother of three children, a divorcee, and a small business owner.  Every time I think about how my circumstances could potentially get in the way of my desire for greatness, I think about my grandmother’s words and how they challenged me to believe in myself  in the toughest of times. Because of her words, I allow my circumstances to empower me to continue to believe in myself. And now, I am asking you to join me in those beliefs.</p>
<p>I want to show how dreams can become a reality, how hard work does pay off, and how a girl from the south side of Chicago can be acclaimed as the best in the industry.  This is an opportunity to come from behind the scenes and take center stage. This is my opportunity to introduce Exquisite Taste and Service to the world.  You can make this possible!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Launch of Exquisite TO GO</strong></h2>
<p>I have the opportunity to scale Exquisite Catering into a retail facility.  With the growth and development of my company and clientele, I have been offered the opportunity to acquire a retail food and service space.  As blessed as I feel for this great advance, it requires a start up cost that would only be possible to amass with your assistance. I am asking for anyone who has a belief in a <strong>small businesses with big experience</strong>, and who believes in me, to be apart of a life changing Exquisite Event.  Your contributions will not only benefit my family, but the community of people whom I will hire to run the facility and whom I will help cultivate into entrepreneurship through Exquisite Possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Specifically</strong>: We need to raise $88,000 to help the start up of the new Exquisite To Go location. Funds will be used to support the start up cost and up to three months of labor and rent to ensure Exquisite can operate a new retail space understanding the risk of a slow start up.</p>
<p>$15,025 Equipment cost</p>
<p>$6000 Production Kitchen Cost </p>
<p>$4,060 Retail Space Rent for 3 months</p>
<p>$19,250 Approximate Employee Labor for 3 months</p>
<p>$20,000 Hired Manager, Accountant, Virtual Assistant, Legal</p>
<p>$1,000 POS System</p>
<p>$22,665 Misc Start up Expenses (COGS, Disposables, Permits, Signage etc)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges of Moving into a Retail Space</strong></p>
<p>As with any small business there are risks to be overcome.  Exquisite Catering &amp; Events has operated solely under direction of  Executive Chef and Owner Tiffany Williams.  ""One of our goals for 2018 was to hire at least full time 2 employees, with the addition of a retail space we will be able to hire up to 6!"" Take a look at the numbers, we are  blessed to have an extreme campaign of word of mouth, amazing food and exquisite service, all this with little marketing and advertising. We have been very careful in selecting our location, menus and procedures to mitigate risks. We are are working with the best mentors, coaches and advisers to make the best decisions and maintain a brand that will continue resonate great food, service and profitability.  This fundraising effort is an attempt to <strong>provide security to future employees</strong>, promote sustainability in the company and to access the resources needed to make it all happen. </p>

Today, I find myself as a single mother of three children, a divorcee, and a small business owner.  Every time I think about how my circumstances could potentially get in the way of my desire for greatness, I think about my grandmother’s words and how they challenged me to believe in myself  in the toughest of times. Because of her words, I allow my circumstances to empower me to continue to believe in myself. And now, I am asking you to join me in those beliefs.
I want to show how dreams can become a reality, how hard work does pay off, and how a girl from the south side of Chicago can be acclaimed as the best in the industry.  This is an opportunity to come from behind the scenes and take center stage. This is my opportunity to introduce Exquisite Taste and Service to the world.  You can make this possible!
 
The Launch of Exquisite TO GO
I have the opportunity to scale Exquisite Catering into a retail facility.  With the growth and development of my company and clientele, I have been offered the opportunity to acquire a retail food and service space.  As blessed as I feel for this great advance, it requires a start up cost that would only be possible to amass with your assistance. I am asking for anyone who has a belief in a small businesses with big experience, and who believes in me, to be apart of a life changing Exquisite Event.  Your contributions will not only benefit my family, but the community of people whom I will hire to run the facility and whom I will help cultivate into entrepreneurship through Exquisite Possibilities.
 
Specifically: We need to raise $88,000 to help the start up of the new Exquisite To Go location. Funds will be used to support the start up cost and up to three months of labor and rent to ensure Exquisite can operate a new retail space understanding the risk of a slow start up.
$15,025 Equipment cost
$6000 Production Kitchen Cost 
$4,060 Retail Space Rent for 3 months
$19,250 Approximate Employee Labor for 3 months
$20,000 Hired Manager, Accountant, Virtual Assistant, Legal
$1,000 POS System
$22,665 Misc Start up Expenses (COGS, Disposables, Permits, Signage etc)
 
Risks & Challenges of Moving into a Retail Space
As with any small business there are risks to be overcome.  Exquisite Catering & Events has operated solely under direction of  Executive Chef and Owner Tiffany Williams.  ""One of our goals for 2018 was to hire at least full time 2 employees, with the addition of a retail space we will be able to hire up to 6!"" Take a look at the numbers, we are  blessed to have an extreme campaign of word of mouth, amazing food and exquisite service, all this with little marketing and advertising. We have been very careful in selecting our location, menus and procedures to mitigate risks. We are are working with the best mentors, coaches and advisers to make the best decisions and maintain a brand that will continue resonate great food, service and profitability.  This fundraising effort is an attempt to provide security to future employees, promote sustainability in the company and to access the resources needed to make it all happen.

<h3>Salem Spice and Salem Gnu Kitchen</h3>
<p>A full-featured commercial shared kitchen with 9 stations for classes and an Allergen Free Kitchenette attached.  Leasing to professional caterers.  A retail store of spices, seasonings, teas, olive oils and extracts outside the kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>David Bowie has been proprietor of Salem Spice since 2010.  Maritime sailing fanatic and a love of spices is what led him to Salem MA.</li>
<li>Roy Bene' is Le Cordon Bleu trained chef originally from New Orleans, recently from Dallas.  He brings education and coordination cred to the kitchen.</li>
<li>Linda A is our kitchen coordinator with more years in the food business than you will care to ask about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Salem Spice has been a haven of flavor in Salem for 6 years.  It's time to grow.  We had our lease last year, March of 2017.  Ready to go, choosing the color for the walls, when BOOM.  Fire.  An electrical fire racing up the walls from the main distribution box.  The second floor was completely devastated.  The first and third floors were uninhabitable. Thankfully nobody was hurt.  The building was washed out, smoked up, and dripping the drops of sorrow for days.  7 days after signing the lease, we were literally homeless.  But not as bad as our neighbors - almost nothing was salvaged.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Salem Spice had not yet moved into the new space.</p>
<p>We were spared the devastation of product loss.  Over a year has passed, and now we have a lease again.  The building has brand new wiring.  New plumbing.  Improved insulation.  Clean walls.  The foundation has been resealed, the roof and awnings redone, the windows replaced,  with the crust and dust of 40 years cleaned in one big washdown.</p>
<p>In business, you have a 5-year plan.  Adjusted annually if not more often.   Our 5-year plan had been to make some really significant changes and upgrades to the space.  But not in the first year.  We had more expected to spread that cost out over a few years.  Now, all that construction, new equipment, and new options are planned for the first year.</p>
<p>Money is expensive.   Our needs are simple.</p>
<p>We have lived a year watching the space be cleaned and repaired, waiting for the opportunity to implement our own design..  Some false starts, some false stops, lots of frustration and yet we are really, truly on the verge of victory now.  We need to find $50,000 to move us from the current phase into production.  </p>

We're glad to have you here with us, but it is also sad that nowadays we have to talk about things which are becoming more and more obvious in view of the changes in the last decades (climate changes, food quality, etc…). To understand what I think of, please look at this <a href=""http://www.wasteminz.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WasteMINZ-2016-The-Age-of-Food.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">presentation</a>, from Julian Cribb, about facts and our possible future, really thoughtful!</p><p>Perhaps we agree that the consumption of healthy, nutrient-rich food, fruit and vegetable from reliable sources is more and more important. Of course, nutritionist ram in vain ""to eat fruit and vegetables five times a day"" to cover the vitamin and mineral needs, as in many cases we do not even have a chance to do so!</p><p>Unfortunately from the 1970s, the plants’ vitamin content has drastically reduced! It does not really matter whether the leached soil, air pollution or the lack of topsoil conditioning causes the poorer nutrient content of the plants because eventually we will eat the result of it anyway!</p><p>Of course, we can eat worthless ""empty"" foods. We can consume unripe tropical fruits treated with chemicals, etc. The human body can tolerate tremendously high burden. <i><strong>But the short-term gains hit back in the long term. </strong></i>What will we eat if the food becomes worthless? Junk food rich in calories... What will be the result? A sick society, who give up on themselves and their survival. Certainly no one would like to live up to see this...</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>OUR SOLUTION</strong></u></p><p>We recommend the algae based product line developed by Greenlife specifically for food shortages, mitigation of problems of daily consumption.

We're glad to have you here with us, but it is also sad that nowadays we have to talk about things which are becoming more and more obvious in view of the changes in the last decades (climate changes, food quality, etc…). To understand what I think of, please look at this presentation, from Julian Cribb, about facts and our possible future, really thoughtful!Perhaps we agree that the consumption of healthy, nutrient-rich food, fruit and vegetable from reliable sources is more and more important. Of course, nutritionist ram in vain ""to eat fruit and vegetables five times a day"" to cover the vitamin and mineral needs, as in many cases we do not even have a chance to do so!Unfortunately from the 1970s, the plants’ vitamin content has drastically reduced! It does not really matter whether the leached soil, air pollution or the lack of topsoil conditioning causes the poorer nutrient content of the plants because eventually we will eat the result of it anyway!Of course, we can eat worthless ""empty"" foods. We can consume unripe tropical fruits treated with chemicals, etc. The human body can tolerate tremendously high burden. But the short-term gains hit back in the long term. What will we eat if the food becomes worthless? Junk food rich in calories... What will be the result? A sick society, who give up on themselves and their survival. Certainly no one would like to live up to see this... OUR SOLUTIONWe recommend the algae based product line developed by Greenlife specifically for food shortages, mitigation of problems of daily consumption. The algae are not taken as a medicine, but as a natural, completely plant-based dietary supplement, a food. A product with plant origin, like fruits and vegetables - however we can obtain it in form of tablets or powder. We strongly believe in, and not only believe but already are utilizing, positive aspects of algae, which can result in positive health effects like:• easement of inflammation• enhancing the immune system• slowing down cellular aging• increasing the number of red blood cells• thinning viral infections• reduce fatigue• eliminate foul breath• getting over iron deficiency• reducing stress and many other positive effects. MANAGEMENT - TEAMRISK MANAGEMENT

<h3>Our Journey</h3>
<p>Hey there, its Lauren, the owner and pastry chef, here! Grain began as my hobby as I raised my (now-toddler) son, Kaiden, while ""finishing"" school. Originally starting as PNW Cupcakes (and later Pacific Northwest Cupcakes, before our final change to Grain), I have always had a passion for cooking and baking with whole ingredients, while supporting sustainable agriculture and local small farmers and businesses. While I started with baking for friends and family, I have grown to serve my clients and fans through farmers markets, pop ups, pairings, custom orders, and weddings. The relationships I have made with not only the local farmers and businesses I source from, but also my clients, are what fuels my fire to continue serving our community with entirely sustainably and locally sourced pastries and cakes. The young Midwest born and raised mom who went to school for political science policy and energy sustainability policy and competed dressage for the NAJYRC, is now finding herself and her passion in the world of pastry. Funny how the world works, isn't it? </p>
<h3>A Bit About Grain</h3>
<p>Grain brings baking back down to the fundamentals, gathering only the locally-sourced, sustainably-harvested, organically-grown, highest-quality ingredients to bring clients the experience of gorgeous desserts that are packed full of exquisite flavor profiles and luxurious textures, crafted carefully by an artisan’s hands. Without the use of preservatives, artificial flavoring, food dyes, or fondant, as Grain owner and pastry chef, I craft one of a kind, nature-inspired, flavorful desserts for clients craving a sustainable-minded bakery that value ingredient sourcing and sustainable agriculture, without sacrificing taste. Blending seasonal bounty with herbs and edible floral notes, many of Grain’s most popular flavors are far from chocolate and vanilla. As well as offering some of the best traditionally-baked pastries around, we pride ourselves in our decadent gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan and paleo options which have captured the hearts of diet-friendly clients from Everett to Issaquah and beyond. We are known for our commitment to using only local and sustainable ingredients, lending to our strong partnerships with small local farmers and our loyal clients who continue coming back for orders because of the high end pastries we serve.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the feature video that we had filmed last year, as well as the gallery of photos of our work!</p>
<h3>The Significance of Community Support in Our Journey</h3>
<p>As we are collecting bakery equipment and tools, submitting permits and licenses, and working with numerous contractors, loan assistants, business coaches, and fellow pastry friends, we need the community's support to continue our journey. As a young, single mom, with limited resources, I have successfully grown Grain from a hobby to a catering business operating out of a commissary kitchen. However, the cost of starting a brick and mortar bakery (or restaurant) from a blank slate space isn't pennies. The opening of this brick and mortar will allow me to: spend more time with my son; bake in the early hours, which allows daily pre-orders; sell at more farmers markets; take on more custom orders, and on shorter timelines; have a pick-up location that is open daily for normal regular hours; and more. Without the opening of our brick and mortar, Grain will likely not be able to continue growth, as we have exceeded our availability at our commissary. Our ever-supportive and loving community of clients, friends and family have been supportive in every step of our journey (including making us the top grossing non-produce vendor at the Snohomish Farmers Market last year!), and we know that with your continued support and sharing of our campaign with your friends, family and colleagues, we will not only open a brick and mortar, but we will become greater Seattle's favorite sustainably-minded, wholesome (and delicious!) bakery!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To continue our well-known trait of transparency, we want you to know EXACTLY what our community's support will help attain. We need a total (including our small business loan and owner equity) of nearly $45,000 to make this brick and mortar happen, and we're a bit short! Here is a list of the expenses that will be covered under the capital required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit on the space, as well as first and second month's rent</li>
<li>Snohomish County Bakery Permit License, Field Plan Review</li>
<li>Snohomish City License</li>
<li>Two Snohomish County Farmers Market Permits (Snohomish Thursdays 3-7p, and Mill Creek Fridays 12-5p!)</li>
<li>King County Farmers Market Permit (year round market(s) out for jury!)</li>
<li>Ingredient stock</li>
<li>Marketing materials (printed on our signature 100% cotton paper with plant based biomass inks)</li>
<li>Buildout (general contractor, electrician, plumber, and zoning permits)</li>
<li>Equipment (oven(s), proofer, fridge, freezer, three basin sink, hand sink, prep sink, mop sink, dishwasher, grease trap, food processor, 20 quart mixer, 10 quart mixer, butcher block tables, storage bins, speed racks, induction stove tops, scales, immersion blender, torch, deep fryer(s), full sheet pans, half sheet pans, extra shelves, dough divider, sheeter, bread materials, and SO MUCH MORE!)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some things we'd really, really like to fund as our stretch-goals after our capital goals are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food photography course</li>
<li>Branded small business feature film and photos to showcase our work and passion</li>
<li>A variety of cake stands to add to our rentals list for our customers</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And of course, what YOU get in return for supporting us! Each of the perks listed below (or to the side, depending on which device you're viewing </span>this<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> on!) includes the cost of the item, plus a bit of a donation, to actually get us the funding needed. (If we only did the cost of the item, we wouldn't have any capital to work with, ya know?) We have some pretty amazing perks, at lots of support points!</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>We are in the process of finalizing the lease and the small business loan, so this brick and mortar will likely be happening no matter what! However, if for some reason this location falls through, we will be searching for another commissary location immediately, or moving to a closer location, which will require us to purchase most of our own equipment regardless.</p>
<p>We'd love to be in the space, as it will create a local gathering spot for enjoying the experience of hand-crafted pastries and cakes baked with only the best ingredients - local, sustainable, organic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Grain never would have gotten this far without your help. If you love Lauren and her story, and our baked goods, but can't afford to back us, thats okay, we totally understand! You can still help by spreading the word and getting the news out there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing our campaign and project with your friends and loved ones through social media and other channels</li>
<li>If you know of an individual or business who may be interested in donating to support a local small business, be sure to share our campaign and our story!</li>
<li>Keep up with our progress and save the date. Invite your friends, families, and loved ones to order their special events needs from Grain, and check out our upcoming pop ups and farmers markets!</li>

As a young, single mom, with limited resources, I have successfully grown Grain from a hobby to a catering business operating out of a commissary kitchen. However, the cost of starting a brick and mortar bakery (or restaurant) from a blank slate space isn't pennies. The opening of this brick and mortar will allow me to: spend more time with my son; bake in the early hours, which allows daily pre-orders; sell at more farmers markets; take on more custom orders, and on shorter timelines; have a pick-up location that is open daily for normal regular hours; and more. Without the opening of our brick and mortar, Grain will likely not be able to continue growth, as we have exceeded our availability at our commissary. Our ever-supportive and loving community of clients, friends and family have been supportive in every step of our journey (including making us the top grossing non-produce vendor at the Snohomish Farmers Market last year!), and we know that with your continued support and sharing of our campaign with your friends, family and colleagues, we will not only open a brick and mortar, but we will become greater Seattle's favorite sustainably-minded, wholesome (and delicious!) bakery!

What We Need & What You Get
To continue our well-known trait of transparency, we want you to know EXACTLY what our community's support will help attain. We need a total (including our small business loan and owner equity) of nearly $45,000 to make this brick and mortar happen, and we're a bit short! Here is a list of the expenses that will be covered under the capital required:

Deposit on the space, as well as first and second month's rent
Snohomish County Bakery Permit License, Field Plan Review
Snohomish City License
Two Snohomish County Farmers Market Permits (Snohomish Thursdays 3-7p, and Mill Creek Fridays 12-5p!)
King County Farmers Market Permit (year round market(s) out for jury!)
Ingredient stock
Marketing materials (printed on our signature 100% cotton paper with plant based biomass inks)
Buildout (general contractor, electrician, plumber, and zoning permits)
Equipment (oven(s), proofer, fridge, freezer, three basin sink, hand sink, prep sink, mop sink, dishwasher, grease trap, food processor, 20 quart mixer, 10 quart mixer, butcher block tables, storage bins, speed racks, induction stove tops, scales, immersion blender, torch, deep fryer(s), full sheet pans, half sheet pans, extra shelves, dough divider, sheeter, bread materials, and SO MUCH MORE!)

And here are some things we'd really, really like to fund as our stretch-goals after our capital goals are met:

Food photography course
Branded small business feature film and photos to showcase our work and passion
A variety of cake stands to add to our rentals list for our customers

And of course, what YOU get in return for supporting us! Each of the perks listed below (or to the side, depending on which device you're viewing this on!) includes the cost of the item, plus a bit of a donation, to actually get us the funding needed. (If we only did the cost of the item, we wouldn't have any capital to work with, ya know?) We have some pretty amazing perks, at lots of support points!
Risks & Challenges

We are in the process of finalizing the lease and the small business loan, so this brick and mortar will likely be happening no matter what! However, if for some reason this location falls through, we will be searching for another commissary location immediately, or moving to a closer location, which will require us to purchase most of our own equipment regardless.
We'd love to be in the space, as it will create a local gathering spot for enjoying the experience of hand-crafted pastries and cakes baked with only the best ingredients - local, sustainable, organic.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In today's world, it can be very challenging to live a healthy lifestyle. We all have a million things to do and are usually in a rush when it comes to consuming food or beverages. One of the biggest gaps in people's diets that is often overlooked is their source of energy (coffee or energy drinks).</p>
<p>Of course we all agree that those cans of sugar and synthetic ingredients we refer to as energy drink are bad for you, but what about our coffee? Have you ever stopped to think about what's in it? Quick example: A 16oz vanilla latte from the largest coffee shop in the world has about 200 calories and 28 grams of sugar. Not as much as the 220 calories and 52 grams of sugar in the most popular energy drink, but still a lot.</p>
<p>We created Wake Up Water to provide a healthy alternative - one without all of those unnecessary calories and sugars. Whether you're looking to crush an early morning workout, power through those post-lunch meetings, or have a long night of work ahead of you, Wake Up Water's got your back. Our goal is to help make living a healthy lifestyle a little easier.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to Gompers Distillery! Our distillery and spirits are named after my grandparents who were both Dutch Holocaust survivors that found a way to look toward the future and thrive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With that spirit of hopefulness and a passion for doing what we love, we are opening the first distillery in Redmond, Oregon. Gompers Distillery will be a place to relax and enjoy life. We will feature our own Gompers Gin and Gompers Old Tom Style Gin, made from the best Pacific Northwest ingredients and will allow us to expand our product offerings and become one of the few grain to glass distilleries.</strong></p>
<p>My Oma and Opa were both Holocaust survivors from Holland and what makes them so inspirational is not just the obvious, that they managed to survive the Holocaust, but they managed to thrive and inspire despite of it. </p>
<p>When I think of my Opa (grandfather), Herman Gompers, I remember him as a fun, outgoing and loving family man. He would always say to us kids, “I am a rich man, not from money but what makes me rich is my beautiful family.” How a man who lost his entire family, except his sister, in the Holocaust could live life with such love and forgiveness is truly inspirational. Herman Gompers never dwelled on the past but always looked to the future. He would often say, “it’s nice to be important and important to be nice.” Words he lived by and words we live by everyday.</p>
<p>To learn more about my Opa, Herman Gompers, you can watch his story in his own words <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpucgIjdK4r6ftP0AjDsvCQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p><strong>We started with gin.</strong></p>
<p>The fun man on the front of our gin bottles is my Opa.  Herman was Dutch and LOVED gin and gin was created by the Dutch so it all went hand in hand. We tried to embody his spirit and love of life in our Estate Gin. We use local hand-picked juniper berries from our horse farm in Bend, Oregon; Tumalo lavender which lends a slight peppery finish and gorgeous Hood River golden pears that add a beautiful and unique fruit note.</p>

<p>Hello, I am a family man running a family business. Whether I have provided a service or product, I stood behind my business. Throughout my career, I sought after business opportunities that were fruitful and beneficial to my customers’ life. Although my prior businesses were fulfilling, <i>Yo Pitts! </i>brings everything into play.</p>
<p> I am a passionate foodie, a health conscience and innovative individual. As I grew older, I realized that I could no longer eat the way I used to due to preservatives and additives.</p>
<p>            The above realization sat in the back of my mind for a while. It was forefront when working on my patented All-Natural Multi-functional soap. While sourcing ingredients, I was intrigued by the phenomenal smells and tastes I indulged in during my visits to farms in upstate NY. I had an epiphany when I tasted several jams. It came to me like the sun parting through cloudy skies:</p>
<p><i>This journey has led me to these experiences to tap into my inner foodie. </i>I thought, I could create flavorful and healthy spreads/condiments to make good food taste delightful. At that moment my condiment line was created.</p>
<p>            As my journey continued, I achieved a bit of the impossible. I established the condiment line and began making strides. My passion and drive has led me to my present position (great products, website, inventory, some distribution, in-store placements). Now, I am reaching out to everyone who likes tasty foods. To move forward with, <i>Yo Pitts! </i>and distribute our products to more consumers, we need funding. Everyone that has tried our products, claims our condiments to be their favorite. I am now reaching out to those people and especially people who haven’t tasted our ketchup and mustard. So, we thank you in advance for your contribution to something great! Choose a perk now that fits your level of passion for food or for great products!</p>
<p>Whether you are hosting a family BBQ,dinner party or golfing event, our brand has the right additions to liven up your gathering. We have various packages available for any event or reception. Come eat with us!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our Ask…</p>
<p>            Our ask is simple: We need funding to expand! We have made it to this point on an aglet budget. An aglet (AG-lət) is a small sheath, often made of plastic or metal, used on each end of a shoelace. Therefore, after flourishing with what we had financially, with less than a shoestring budget, it’s time to expand. Our demand has increased and customer satisfaction, we are ready to take <i>Yo Pitts!</i> on a national platform  Our financial prowess is stellar and we have this planned out extensively.</p>
<p>We are aggressively expanding our reach with orders (local and online), new stores and restaurants as well as events. We need to get our products out there.</p>
<p><strong>(40%) Transportation</strong> – we are looking to purchase our first vehicle:</p>
<p>The <i>Yo Pitts!</i> <i>Food</i> Truck</p>
<p>Once we have the fund to purchase one, wave when you see us because we are either delivering to a store, restaurant, customer or our charity work at food banks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550193619/dp7g8ghybalqnjlyxt7c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We’ve received outstanding reviews from our customers, but we need to let everyone else know about us. We tried shouting from rooftops and street corners. We decided to partner up with a marketing company and we created a plan to gain more exposure nationwide.</p>
<p><strong>(30%) Marketing –</strong> we are planning a nationwide campaign with deep hyper-local segments using digital, mobile, TV, radio and some OOH.</p>
<p>We may be looking to possibly feature some of our customers for a more personable approach.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550193735/c1rnhcjyzhu1g0lh7nci.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As things progress, our production workload will increase. With that being said, we need to expand in several areas. We are also facilitating more wedding favors and events. We are building out our fundraising business for schools and other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>(30%) Expansion–</strong> We are looking to increase production, our wedding/event channel and our fundraising channel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550194685/dllkotqj5pabwdx7kam2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Quotes from the family:</p>
<p>            Mom – “I believe in you but this better be good!”</p>
<p>            Sister – “You got this, older brother!”</p>
<p>            Wife – “You can do it, baby. Better let me check it out though”</p>
<p>            Daughter – “Hey Dad, what is this stuff? It’s good!”</p>
<p>Our perks represent a lifestyle that incorporates many different aspects of tastes and touches all. We selected a few lifestyles, but whatever your lifestyle is <i>Yo Pitts!</i>, can be part of it.</p>
<p>If we raise funds above our goal, we will roll out our <i>ON THE GO</i> initiative. <i>ON THE GO</i> will include a mobile and a snack pack.</p>
<p> The mobile app will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where to buy our products.</li>
<li>What foods our flavors go with (through science)</li>
<li>What beverages pair with our flavors</li>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>All on the GO!</p>
<p>Also we are in the development stages of creating a snack pack. We desire to produce a snack pack that is healthy and tasty on the GO!</p>

<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","Hello, I am a family man running a family business. Whether I have provided a service or product, I stood behind my business. Throughout my career, I sought after business opportunities that were fruitful and beneficial to my customers’ life. Although my prior businesses were fulfilling, Yo Pitts! brings everything into play.
 I am a passionate foodie, a health conscience and innovative individual. As I grew older, I realized that I could no longer eat the way I used to due to preservatives and additives.
            The above realization sat in the back of my mind for a while. It was forefront when working on my patented All-Natural Multi-functional soap. While sourcing ingredients, I was intrigued by the phenomenal smells and tastes I indulged in during my visits to farms in upstate NY. I had an epiphany when I tasted several jams. It came to me like the sun parting through cloudy skies:
This journey has led me to these experiences to tap into my inner foodie. I thought, I could create flavorful and healthy spreads/condiments to make good food taste delightful. At that moment my condiment line was created.
            As my journey continued, I achieved a bit of the impossible. I established the condiment line and began making strides. My passion and drive has led me to my present position (great products, website, inventory, some distribution, in-store placements). Now, I am reaching out to everyone who likes tasty foods. To move forward with, Yo Pitts! and distribute our products to more consumers, we need funding. Everyone that has tried our products, claims our condiments to be their favorite. I am now reaching out to those people and especially people who haven’t tasted our ketchup and mustard. So, we thank you in advance for your contribution to something great! Choose a perk now that fits your level of passion for food or for great products!
Whether you are hosting a family BBQ,dinner party or golfing event, our brand has the right additions to liven up your gathering. We have various packages available for any event or reception. Come eat with us!
 
What We Need & What You Get
Our Ask…
            Our ask is simple: We need funding to expand! We have made it to this point on an aglet budget. An aglet (AG-lət) is a small sheath, often made of plastic or metal, used on each end of a shoelace. Therefore, after flourishing with what we had financially, with less than a shoestring budget, it’s time to expand. Our demand has increased and customer satisfaction, we are ready to take Yo Pitts! on a national platform  Our financial prowess is stellar and we have this planned out extensively.
We are aggressively expanding our reach with orders (local and online), new stores and restaurants as well as events. We need to get our products out there.
(40%) Transportation – we are looking to purchase our first vehicle:
The Yo Pitts! Food Truck
Once we have the fund to purchase one, wave when you see us because we are either delivering to a store, restaurant, customer or our charity work at food banks.
 

We’ve received outstanding reviews from our customers, but we need to let everyone else know about us. We tried shouting from rooftops and street corners. We decided to partner up with a marketing company and we created a plan to gain more exposure nationwide.
(30%) Marketing – we are planning a nationwide campaign with deep hyper-local segments using digital, mobile, TV, radio and some OOH.
We may be looking to possibly feature some of our customers for a more personable approach.

As things progress, our production workload will increase. With that being said, we need to expand in several areas. We are also facilitating more wedding favors and events. We are building out our fundraising business for schools and other organizations.
(30%) Expansion– We are looking to increase production, our wedding/event channel and our fundraising channel.

Quotes from the family:
            Mom – “I believe in you but this better be good!”
            Sister – “You got this, older brother!”
            Wife – “You can do it, baby. Better let me check it out though”
            Daughter – “Hey Dad, what is this stuff? It’s good!”
Our perks represent a lifestyle that incorporates many different aspects of tastes and touches all. We selected a few lifestyles, but whatever your lifestyle is Yo Pitts!, can be part of it.
If we raise funds above our goal, we will roll out our ON THE GO initiative. ON THE GO will include a mobile and a snack pack.
 The mobile app will include:

Where to buy our products.
What foods our flavors go with (through science)
What beverages pair with our flavors
Recipes
Games

All on the GO!
Also we are in the development stages of creating a snack pack. We desire to produce a snack pack that is healthy and tasty on the GO!
We don’t imagine for one minute that this will be easy – it hasn’t been so far. However, the tasty products we produce and passion we have for the healthy goodness pushes us. The tremendous amount of business insight and support I have is a true blessing.
Now, this is where YOU - the reader comes in.
If you can purchase a perk, no matter what level, it is appreciated.
Every small drop of water helps to fill even the biggest of buckets! -TP (that’s me)
You can also spread the word, no need to scream or shout (We’ve tried that already). You can help by posting about our campaign on any social media platform or send an email.

<p>Zoals je misschien al gelezen hebt in de campagne of gezien hebt in de video, is het mijn motto om het leven te vieren. En voor mij is tisane daarvoor echt de beste manier!</p>

<p>Hi! I am Sandra, and welcome to <strong>HAPPY TEAS, </strong>my new herbal tea business, based in Perth, Western Australia.</p>

<p><i>Tea production for making Morning Chai</i></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>My interest of actually making natural remedies myself started with me and my partner growing some herbs on our balcony when I had just moved to Perth from Stockholm. Delighted with the sheer fact that it wasn't dark for six months of the year and that thing that you put in a pot actually might survive, I absolutely filled the little space up with all kinds of herbs and plants and also started conserving them (I actually had that much abundance, I thought, it was amazing!). </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524832368/leomtlrd0nfn4sysk2ay.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>My home-grown lavender harvest.</i></p>
<p>Luckily, a year after, we were able to move in to a house with a small garden. We quite instantly filled it up with all sorts of yummy herbs and vegetables and that spring I also managed to do a cert II in horticulture at the local Tafe, which gave me some extra knowledge about gardening. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524832399/x895cfugcczzvmsye5vm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Locally sourced rose petals from Kakulas Brothers in Northbridge.</i></p>
<h3>The start of Happy Teas</h3>
<p>Then, really just by chance, I started out making some teas for my friends who needed them for different problems or situations. After a while my partner indicated (strongly) to me that I should really give this tea-business a go. So I decided, carefully at first, to try to expand my tea-making into a business and realized that I really enjoyed the entrepreneurial side of it as well. </p>

<p>So I did a lot of research on marketing and legalities and started making my standard production, which can be found below. ​ </p>
<h3>The concept of Happy Teas</h3>
<p>The idea of Happy Teas is that it should be easy to choose natural remedies over pharmaceutical.

<p><i>Starting my day, with a cosy cup of tea.</i></p>
<p>Moreover, I want costumers to know why the product is good for them, which is something I often miss when buying ""remedy teas"". So rather than generic lines like ""restful lavender"" and such I will send each customer an email with an explanatory note explaining the content of the product. </p>

<p><i>Take a break. Pause. Have a cup of tea.</i></p>
<p>I try to also source my material and ingredients as local as possible (as well as selling locally). I don't just want to be another brand but a local presence along with my products so that all costumers can feel safe with what they buy!</p>

<p>“Thank you Happy Teas. I have been very pleased with my purchases, 'Grumpy Tummy' and 'Night Time' tea, both of which I would recommend. I love that your herbal teas are made from all natural ingredients and have no caffine. I must also make mention of the detail in the packaging. Each packet has the ingredients written on the back of the packet and instructions for use on the bottom of the packet. Then there is the very personal touch of hand drawn pictures, every one different on different teas. Love it! Thanks again Happy Teas” - Yvonne White, Burns Beach WA</p>
<p>""I have tried three different teas from Happy Teas and they have all been a wonderful surprise. The two morning teas are energizing and gives me a bit of an extra boost after waking up, especially the chai. I have also tried the grumpy tummy and usually have it after dinner and it helps soothe my stomach well after a big meal!"" - Tristan White, Joondalup WA</p>

“Thank you Happy Teas. I have been very pleased with my purchases, 'Grumpy Tummy' and 'Night Time' tea, both of which I would recommend. I love that your herbal teas are made from all natural ingredients and have no caffine. I must also make mention of the detail in the packaging. Each packet has the ingredients written on the back of the packet and instructions for use on the bottom of the packet. Then there is the very personal touch of hand drawn pictures, every one different on different teas. Love it! Thanks again Happy Teas” - Yvonne White, Burns Beach WA
""I have tried three different teas from Happy Teas and they have all been a wonderful surprise. The two morning teas are energizing and gives me a bit of an extra boost after waking up, especially the chai. I have also tried the grumpy tummy and usually have it after dinner and it helps soothe my stomach well after a big meal!"" - Tristan White, Joondalup WA
Special Thanks
Thank you to the Edith Cowan Business students for assisting me in the creation of this crowdfunding initiative.

<h2>Who are we? </h2>
<p>We are a 3rd generation husband &amp; wife team of Coffee planters on a quest to share our Award-winning coffee beans with coffee lovers around the world. Taking a break from working in Hollywood, Prasanna and Anthi have temporarily relocated to India to take care of their family's coffee plantation. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526103952/pbjwpkqudb7am2cvrbik.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Grown responsibly in a high-altitude region in Southern India, our coffee beans are hand picked, machine pulped and sun dried to achieve the highest cupping quality and taste. Our Coffee estate has been winning national recognition every year for the quality and flavor of its beans. </p>
<p>Every time we travel to India, we bring back fresh coffee for our friends in California and they can't wait to get brewing. So we are now on Indiegogo to launch our very own brand of coffee beans called ""WiCoPo - Wild Coffee in a Pot"" and reach out to other coffee enthusiasts around the world and offer them high quality Indian beans, filled with unique and strong flavors. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526104186/n5ud6gt5ziulttix19sg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Why are we on Indiegogo? </h2>
<p>Well, because you guys are awesome and we want to start slow by targeting coffee enthusiasts before scaling up to retail. We have tied up with a professional packaging company that will ensure high quality packaging with little to no loss in aroma and flavor. Apart from getting great coffee, your funding and support will also give us the confidence to take our coffee to new markets. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526104261/xtragzpfr4axudfbdkar.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A lot of work goes into growing coffee, from keeping the plants healthy and the insects away, to giving them the right nutrients and water. As planters, nothings give us more satisfaction than seeing our coffee enjoyed and appreciated. This is the driving force behind us to get our beans into coffee cups around the world. </p>
<h2>What do you get for supporting us ?</h2>
<p>As we have just completed our picking season, we are ready to ship to you premium quality arabica beans roasted (or unroasted) to your preference. You can grind these beans to your requirement, depending on your brewing apparatus and enjoy some of India's finest brews. </p>

<p>We’re launching more than a company. We’re turning around a town.</p>

<p>Launching a pilot project there which includes a new restaurant. Steve recognized Justin’s</p>

<p>professionals, in hopes of finding people willing to help him with the café launch as well as</p>
<p>other projects associated with the town’s revitalization. During this time, he met Brandon White, a</p>
<p>new local to Blacksburg, originally from Central Virginia. Brandon came to the area because of</p>
<p>the simple lifestyle it offered and became captivated by Pulaski when Justin brought the area to his</p>
<p>attention, presenting the opportunities, the history, and the community. Both individuals spent their years, since able to legally hold a job, working for</p>
<p>different restaurants throughout Virginia. They started bussing tables, working up through</p>
<p>hosting, waiting tables, cooking, and even managing other employees. These skills are</p>
<p>essential to any restaurant, but they believe they can cultivate a</p>
<p>new type of experience at Crescent City Café, one</p>
<p>that will draw people to Pulaski for one meal, then another, and then, even, a lifetime, which is the true mission of their enterprise.</p>
<p>What once began as a Pilot Project on Main Street has become a Pilot Project for the heart of Pulaski, propped up with smiles and good food</p>
<p>for years to come. So far, the community of</p>
<p>Pulaski has been instrumental to Crescent City’s progress, as they have helped secure a</p>
<p>building which is currently under renovations, as well as helping us spread the word through</p>
<p>events, media, friends, and family. Completing this crowdfunding campaign would enable us to</p>
<p>take the last few steps in order to get the restaurant up and running.</p>
<p>We are hoping to obtain twenty thousand dollars through our Indegogo campaign. This</p>
<p>money will bolster personal investment in the project, which will be leveraged by a bank</p>
<p>loan required to purchase equipment for both our kitchen and customers. Any</p>
<p>extra money will be left as operating capital providing a cushion for our early months and</p>
<p>seasonal fluctuations. These funds ensure forward progress, building off the steps already taken. We’ve already obtained a building on West Main Street that has been restored under</p>
<p>historic regulations thanks to community of Pulaski, and the state of Virginia. We’re dedicated to</p>
<p>helping the community the best way we know how and will see this project through.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to our future in Pulaski and envision amazing things to come for</p>
<p>the town. This location embodies a true Appalachian escape, where a creek runs through the center of the historic downtown and blue-gray hills offer spectacular views.</p>

<h3>
<br/>About us:</h3>
<h3>Hi, Im Benny! and this is my friend and business partner, Steve. Besides working as a chef in restaurants for years, I've also owned and operated food trucks the last 5 years.  Steve grew up in the restaurant and catering business with his family. In addition to his owning his own successful food trailer, he's also a graduate of Robert Morris University business with a degree in business managment and extremely knowledgeable on that side of it.  </h3>
<p>Last year Steve and I joined forces and started the first Steve and Benny's Chicken Shack, a mobile food trailer! Serving quick and convenient fried chicken sandwiches, it's been a smash hit! As with our previous trucks, it's very rewarding, exciting and thrilling to start a business from nothing, build it up with your own blood, sweat and tears,  and see it become successful. Now, due to demand from all of you, we are growing! Steve and Benny's is expanding to a new food truck, as well as a brick and mortar location.  As we have bootstrapped the first trailer with our own money, energy and time, we're asking for some help with our next phase. Help us bring local fried chicken goodness to the masses!</p>
<p> We are incredibly grateful and appreciative of the overwhelming support from you, our  hometown Pittsburghers. We  want to continually share the gift of our talents by feeding all of you in this great city. In return for helping us along the way, we'll be hooking you all up with some super cool items and experiences. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are building a second chicken truck! We've already saved up and purchased our new food truck, but need a total of $10,650 to adequately build out with equipment, graphics, etc.  We're working directly with our local food truck builder/fabricator who has lots of experience building food trucks, to build out our second (jokingly referred to as CHICKEN#2)</li>
<li>We have already secured a building as our new kitchen and eventual restaurant, just northwest of PIttsburgh in Monaca.  We've already started investing our own time and money into this new building, and any Additional  funds raised will go directly to speeding up the process of us opening !! </li>
<li> Besides some cool stuff like stickers, magnets, growlers, and giving away a ton of food, we also wanted to give you the opportunity to snag up some one of a kind ""EXPERIENCES""! </li>
<li>Obviously every cent helps and we know that!  If we don't hit our goal, what we do raise will help tremendously, and of course we would continue doing what we do best, hustle and finish it off ourselves! We have a great track record and wouldn't dream of letting all of you down!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are NOT CORPORATE! We're just two local dudes who love to cook for people! That's why we value our customers and supporters so much! We can do great things but only with the help and support of you.  We want to share our love of food and friendship with as many people as possible! </li>
<li> With our track record I am 100% confident that Steve and Benny's will continue to grow and be a massive success! We have taken all the years of experience to build a solid, streamlined, profitable business and lay the groundwork to grow big all over Pittsburgh and beyond!</li>

</div></div>","About us:
Hi, Im Benny! and this is my friend and business partner, Steve. Besides working as a chef in restaurants for years, I've also owned and operated food trucks the last 5 years.  Steve grew up in the restaurant and catering business with his family. In addition to his owning his own successful food trailer, he's also a graduate of Robert Morris University business with a degree in business managment and extremely knowledgeable on that side of it.  
Last year Steve and I joined forces and started the first Steve and Benny's Chicken Shack, a mobile food trailer! Serving quick and convenient fried chicken sandwiches, it's been a smash hit! As with our previous trucks, it's very rewarding, exciting and thrilling to start a business from nothing, build it up with your own blood, sweat and tears,  and see it become successful. Now, due to demand from all of you, we are growing! Steve and Benny's is expanding to a new food truck, as well as a brick and mortar location.  As we have bootstrapped the first trailer with our own money, energy and time, we're asking for some help with our next phase. Help us bring local fried chicken goodness to the masses!
 We are incredibly grateful and appreciative of the overwhelming support from you, our  hometown Pittsburghers. We  want to continually share the gift of our talents by feeding all of you in this great city. In return for helping us along the way, we'll be hooking you all up with some super cool items and experiences. 

What We Need & What You Get
 

We are building a second chicken truck! We've already saved up and purchased our new food truck, but need a total of $10,650 to adequately build out with equipment, graphics, etc.  We're working directly with our local food truck builder/fabricator who has lots of experience building food trucks, to build out our second (jokingly referred to as CHICKEN#2)
We have already secured a building as our new kitchen and eventual restaurant, just northwest of PIttsburgh in Monaca.  We've already started investing our own time and money into this new building, and any Additional  funds raised will go directly to speeding up the process of us opening !! 
 Besides some cool stuff like stickers, magnets, growlers, and giving away a ton of food, we also wanted to give you the opportunity to snag up some one of a kind ""EXPERIENCES""! 
Obviously every cent helps and we know that!  If we don't hit our goal, what we do raise will help tremendously, and of course we would continue doing what we do best, hustle and finish it off ourselves! We have a great track record and wouldn't dream of letting all of you down!


The Impact

We are NOT CORPORATE! We're just two local dudes who love to cook for people! That's why we value our customers and supporters so much! We can do great things but only with the help and support of you.  We want to share our love of food and friendship with as many people as possible! 
 With our track record I am 100% confident that Steve and Benny's will continue to grow and be a massive success! We have taken all the years of experience to build a solid, streamlined, profitable business and lay the groundwork to grow big all over Pittsburgh and beyond!
Our first Steve and Benny's is out on the road now! follow on FB and IG! also we will be posting updates on the buildout of the newest Food truck, as well as the new physical home!

<p><strong>Hi I’m Ross Taylor… and 8 months ago, I leapt off the edge of a cliff.  </strong></p>
<p>I said goodbye to my corporate role as a Designer with one of the worlds’ biggest confectionery companies and have been channelling every bit of passion, skill and experience (so luckily learnt from some of the best in the industry) into designing, creating and launching an interactive app/website which delivers the first, truly personalised, chocolate bar.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed the challenge of how to bring confectionery out of the dark ages and into the digital age whilst maintaining traditional craftsmanship and loved having the freedom to focus on how to put smiles on faces and create unique and memorable connections.               </p>
<p>So now, after months of hard work and late nights, I am ready to showcase Taylor’d Confections to the big wide world and hope that enough of you good people, like what you read and want to support this 20-something from South London, to be able to say to the Big Boys – ‘this is how you do it’.</p>
<p><strong>So what exactly is this App?</strong><br/><br/>Taylor'd Confections enables you to create a unique, confectionery connection by designing a bar of chocolate to include Pet Names, In-Jokes, Personal Insults, 'Do you remember when' Moments, Favourite One-Liners, Luvvy Doveyness Overload....basically, you can say anything!<br/><br/>We are giving you the creative freedom to immortalise your personalised words in chocolate for the delight of those who matter in your life.<br/><br/>AND, not only can you get witty with words but you can truly design your bar by choosing flavours, adding fillings, selecting designs and tailoring the packaging.<br/><br/>Think what you could do with this premium-level Personalisation. No more quick dashes to the corner shop for a box of generic chocs (guilty - I'm publically apologising here Mum), with our easy-to-use App, you can fast become Favourite Son again, Thoughtful Boyfriend, Top Geezer, Best Brother in the World.  <br/><br/>Our experts will carefully craft your creation and send it direct to your receiver's door (within 3-5 working days) hassle free for you and a unique treat for those who matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I need your love, your Likes, your Shares, your support, your networks, your ££’s and any spare hugs!</p>
<p>If you can see the potential and love the idea, GET INVOLVED, get behind the campaign, choose one of our Perks, Like us on Facebook, get Tweeting.  Who do you know that would love to shout out about this for me?  Fairy Godmothers &amp; Godfathers - your wand-waving is needed. </p>
<p>Behind every great man is a greater woman (my fiancée has been epic) and I’m doing this for her, for us, for humankind! Our world needs more smiles and generous gestures.</p>
<p>So, get on board, enjoy the ride and let’s create a story.  </p>

<p>Although this is one man’s dream, I have a very real business plan and goal for the campaign.

<p>I have worked hard to mitigate risk but this is my first Indiegogo so naturally there's an element of unknown involved. That said, I have worked hard to ensure everything is in hand and planned for, so I am confident that my Indiegogo debut will not disappoint.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCTION RISK </strong>- We are currently going through the motions of having our production premises signed off by the Foods Standards Agency, we foresee no issues. Our priority is to obtain the necessary food safety and compliance documentation to produce high quality confections!</p>
<p><strong>MANUFACTURING </strong>-The kitchen scale prototypes that we have created look and taste great! I am super happy with the quality, and long may this continue! Whilst I am not a confectioner by background, 9 years working along some or the world leading chocolate experts gave me a great knowledge of both production and the science behind the behaviour of chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>LOGISTICS- </strong>We have teamed up with a well known logistics company that will secure accurate and fast delivery to our backers. We are working on the development of temperature controlled shipper packs to ensure product quality in the warmer months. I have experience designing e-commerce temperature controlled packaging for one of the worlds leading luxury coffee brands.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I am the owner of Jade Chocolates, an award winning chocolate company based on my cultural background.  We specialize in blending teas, spices and tropical fruits from Asia and the Pacific Islands.   For the past 12 years,  we've produced tantalizing bon bons, flavored chocolate bars and  confections.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586554549/daaxev8zgenvj7ku56vq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are expanding our line of chocolates into a cafe setting where one can have Asian and Pacific Island brunch, afternoon tea, pastries and flavored hot chocolates on one of the most vibrant streets of San Francisco.  I envision the space where people can congregate and share their love of chocolate with others, take a class in chocolate or pastry making,  have a date during one of our special movie nights, or enjoy a tea party with your friends.  Our first shop was out of the way for many, as it was situated in a family oriented neighborhood.  It was a small, hard to get to storefront, but it was a necessary first step into retail.  Our lease is up and it's time to expand. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586555526/kt8g6nvkj7btkjnrzaz6.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>Having a cafe in Chinatown is more than just a dream.  As a 5th generation San Franciscan, my Chinese ancestry began in these streets in the late 1800's.   My family lived and worked in Chinatown during the 1906 Earthquake, the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Great Depression, and now with me, during the COVID-19 pandemic.   In those early beginnings, my family had no choice but to live here.  Venturing out of Chinatown was sure to stir up negative emotions and possible physical violence.  Today, I chose to come back to the same neighborhood that rooted my family in California.  San Francisco's Chinatown streets are what formed  who I am.  This is where Jade Chocolates belongs.</p>
<p>The purpose of this cafe is not just to sell chocolates, but as a place where we can promote culture through food. </p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p> We have a long road ahead of us to get the funds we need to see this project through.  The current state of the world has hindered this even more with two key investors backing out.  We anticipate the entire project will cost $250K which will come through a combination of crowdfunding, loans and private investors.  As with many projects hitting unforeseen roadblocks, we are in the midst of COVID-19.  It will push back our opening date 3-4 months, missing the summer peak.  We also will start paying rent on June 1st, the day we anticipated our Grand Opening.  Opening day most likely won't occur until this coming Fall.</p>
<p>It's surreal to be raising funds for this project during the worldwide coronavirus outbreak but this pandemic will not stop this project.  Our biggest obstacle is raising funds to open.  We have over 12 years of experience in the chocolate making business with a loyal following in San Francisco and beyond.  We have hired an executive chef with 30  years of knowledge  handling all the new savory and baked items and I have confidently let go of most of my reigns in the chocolate kitchen to a new lead chocolatier.  We have a strong team of people and a loyal following of existing customers. </p>

</div></div>","History
Hi everyone!
I am the owner of Jade Chocolates, an award winning chocolate company based on my cultural background.  We specialize in blending teas, spices and tropical fruits from Asia and the Pacific Islands.   For the past 12 years,  we've produced tantalizing bon bons, flavored chocolate bars and  confections.  
We are expanding our line of chocolates into a cafe setting where one can have Asian and Pacific Island brunch, afternoon tea, pastries and flavored hot chocolates on one of the most vibrant streets of San Francisco.  I envision the space where people can congregate and share their love of chocolate with others, take a class in chocolate or pastry making,  have a date during one of our special movie nights, or enjoy a tea party with your friends.  Our first shop was out of the way for many, as it was situated in a family oriented neighborhood.  It was a small, hard to get to storefront, but it was a necessary first step into retail.  Our lease is up and it's time to expand. 

Having a cafe in Chinatown is more than just a dream.  As a 5th generation San Franciscan, my Chinese ancestry began in these streets in the late 1800's.   My family lived and worked in Chinatown during the 1906 Earthquake, the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Great Depression, and now with me, during the COVID-19 pandemic.   In those early beginnings, my family had no choice but to live here.  Venturing out of Chinatown was sure to stir up negative emotions and possible physical violence.  Today, I chose to come back to the same neighborhood that rooted my family in California.  San Francisco's Chinatown streets are what formed  who I am.  This is where Jade Chocolates belongs.
The purpose of this cafe is not just to sell chocolates, but as a place where we can promote culture through food. 
Here's a list of events we plan to host:



Learn how to play mah jong party-Whether a seasoned player or a beginner, all are welcome to join and play for in-store prizes. Tables will be matched with similar skill levels

Hawaiian Night/May Day Celebration- Feast on a luau, learn how to make a lei and their significance of their islands with live music. 

I'm a chocolatier (2 part series)

Cooking with tea (2 part series with sweet and savory applications)

Kawaii your food (kid's cooking class)-inspiring food as art by making your food look 'cute'.
Making Dessert Sushi

Movie Night--an example is Like Water For Chocolate with a chocolate inspired dinner will be served.

 
Challenges
 We have a long road ahead of us to get the funds we need to see this project through.  The current state of the world has hindered this even more with two key investors backing out.  We anticipate the entire project will cost $250K which will come through a combination of crowdfunding, loans and private investors.  As with many projects hitting unforeseen roadblocks, we are in the midst of COVID-19.  It will push back our opening date 3-4 months, missing the summer peak.  We also will start paying rent on June 1st, the day we anticipated our Grand Opening.  Opening day most likely won't occur until this coming Fall.
It's surreal to be raising funds for this project during the worldwide coronavirus outbreak but this pandemic will not stop this project.  Our biggest obstacle is raising funds to open.  We have over 12 years of experience in the chocolate making business with a loyal following in San Francisco and beyond.  We have hired an executive chef with 30  years of knowledge  handling all the new savory and baked items and I have confidently let go of most of my reigns in the chocolate kitchen to a new lead chocolatier.  We have a strong team of people and a loyal following of existing customers. 

 
 
 
Secondly, having our new homebase in the path of tourists will elevate our popularity even more bringing Jade Chocolates to the forefront of a must have souvenir from this great city.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>At Carnivore House, we decided to take control, from sourcing the animals to ensuring that they were humanely raised and finished to controlling all ingredients used in the course of meat preparation, thus making sure that we and our families including yours eat healthy quality and blessed meat with the highest quality possible and it all starts from the farms we deal with and ends on your table mixed with love.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Mummified Jerky was a result of many years of search for a high-quality Halal meat. All the available offerings lacked transparency in one thing or another.  From flavor profile, meat quality to the source of the meat and method of slaughter. We decided to take things into our own hands, we started sourcing our meat, scrutinizing our dry and wet ingredients, and developing our own recipes to suite the taste and dietary restrictions of our Halal consumers. Shortly later, we expanded our offerings to be one of the first to introduce  Lamb Jerky and more poultry Jerky.  As a result, Mummified Jerky was one of the sold Halal Jerky products and on Amazon's choice recommended products.</p>
<p>We received overwhelming positive feedback and encouragement from all of our customers and during food expos such as GulfFood, and Muslim Conferences such as MASICNA to take it one step further. This empowered our aspiration to fulfill the pressing need for unique Halal premium offerings beyond jerky. <strong> We are bringing the same vision, passion and process of our Mummified Jerky brand to deliver fresh meats.  Expanding our products to include beef, lamb, goat, chicken and squabs.</strong></p>
<p>We are determined to Halalify the experience using the best quality, grass fed and humanely raised Beef, Lamb, Goat and Poultry.  And taking it to the next level by offering deli meats and sausages and any meat cooking techniques that are very popular with Western style charcuterie and smoked products,</p>
<p>As a Result, we decided to create<strong> </strong><strong>Carnivore House </strong>where we never buy frozen meat or any generic Halal meat where the source is not 100% known. We only sell what we can feed our families and Customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>To be able to deliver on our promise, we run a huge risk of fluctuating livestock market prices as well as availability of certain breeds. <br/>We plan to absorb any price differences and form alliances with multiple farmers to source our livestock to mitigate the availability risk.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, all I am Mason Snyder, and I am a Chef (and a rodeo cowboy and Veteran, stories for another time). I have one goal to make food local, to support the local economy, put the ownership back into small family farms, reduce carbon emissions from long haul transportation, there are endless reason to push local!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613538328/bzevi3fm3pbddwl1dugy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I want to do it through a mobile catering company in order to do that we need a food truck! We want to use the local farmers and wholesalers who buy local to be the core of the food we supply to every event we cater, birthday party, graduation, and wedding, it should be special and not just some catering company that tries to give you the cheapest quality food and charge you outstanding rates to ""get by"" on the event. We are here to do better, you should #DemandLocalCC</p>
<h3>Q and A on Instagram</h3>
<p>Want to know more about me, my goals with food, the business, how we want to make it happen, my experience, whatever: Every Thursday and Sunday starting 2/18 on Instagram I'll do a Q&amp;A where you can ask anything you want <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/the.cowboy.chef/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@the.cowboy.chef</a> so you know what and who you are helping. Its also when and where we'll do our weekly shoutouts!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613559724/e80ushve0hqpm5dutkbc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ideally we would want a new build out on a food truck which will cost around 70,000 dollars, that's a lot of dough(pun intended)! If you have worked in the food and beverage industry you know as a cook you don't make much so saving up for this venture of owning your own company is difficult, but we managed to get enough to get the business up and running, operating from commissary kitchens and private client homes is the current practice, but it doesn't give us the capabilities we need to do your events anywhere, anytime! </p>
<p>If we get the 70,000 we are ready to roll to your home and put on a party, if we can at least reach 20,000 we will secure enough capital for a bank to agree to the rest. If we are still under we won't be quitting on this goal, we'll keep try, this isn't just a business it's an idea!</p>
<p>Every little bit helps!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This isn't just a business to me, this is a way to change the food system to force the competition to compete and also use local food and farmers for sourcing. We want to not just use the business as a way to make money but as a platform to discuss food and where it comes from, to produce videos, on what farmers are doing, how to cook foods those foods, even how to approach find farmers for your food, forage for your own (check out our video with Yampatika) even get them to show you how to grow your own. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk, is this is this is a business and we need to compete, but I do believe we have a solid 5-year profit-and-loss projections that will help us overcome financial obstacles in a realistic fashion, I don't just hold a degree in Culinary Arts but also Business Administration which come's in handy to managing an efficient business.</p>
<p>We also need to be able to supply a variety of foods from the local environment and farms, we need to make those connections but also provide them with the right amount of business for them to work with us, getting the funding for the food truck puts us in that position to be mutually beneficial. </p>

And if you're making a popular dish like risotto, it's even easier – just select the pre-programmed, one-touch setting and go.MasterSous also allows you to program the stirring speed and stirring interval. For instance, you can set your grandma's pasta sauce to stir slowly every 2 minutes for 4 hours. The digital controls allow for precise control of time and temperature, so that your food doesn’t overcook or burn.MasterSous’ cooking temperature can range from 100°F to 450°F, and its infrared temperature sensor makes sure it’s precise. It also has pre-set food settings for more than eight types of common oils, so you can heat oil right up to its smoking point, without going over, for perfect crispness and moisture retention.  With the MasterSous mobile app for iOS and Android devices, all of the settings that are available on the machine are at your fingertips, even when you’re out of the house. You can increase the cook time or temperature, know exactly when your food is done, keep the food warm or shut it off altogether. MasterSous will also alert you if cooking has been interrupted. The beauty of MasterSous is that you can get rid of all the other bulky cookers that clutter your counters and replace them one modern, yet classic, device. Plus, it comes in four different colors, so you can choose what best matches your style.MasterSous is the perfect accessory to every kitchen! But, if keeping your cooking tools out isn’t your thing, MasterSous is only 16.5 inches tall and 18 inches wide, so it will easily fit tucked away.  And don’t worry, just because it’s sleek doesn’t mean MasterSous isn’t roomy. MasterSous has plenty of space (6 quarts!) to cook large amounts of food for the whole family… and still have leftovers for friends! All of the materials used to craft MasterSous are safe for cooking and never contain any chemicals like PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid). The MasterSous sensors make it easy to tell when your food is ready through the infrared temperature sensor. What’s more, the cooking interruption indicator will send a message straight to your smartphone should something interrupt your cooking. The sensors even enlist auto-shut off when your food is done.  Take away the stigma of cleaning up with MasterSous. MasterSous’ non-stick materials make cleanup a cinch, so you can get to the fun stuff…eating!

The fact that you are here shows that you are willing to help someone to fulfill their dream and people who are willing to take time out of their day and money from their wallets to do so are in short supply in this day and age so whether you choose to support myself or anyone else on this site I sincerely thank you.</p><p>A few years ago my wife and I answered an ad in our local paper for ice cream truck drivers. We thought it would be a fun way to earn some money and be able to spend time together while doing so. We were right. This job became much more than a job for us. The joy we were able to bring to people who were seeing the truck for the first time and to people who saw us and remembered seeing a neighborhood ice cream man 50 years ago was amazing and reflected by the joy in our hearts at being able to spend our days together enjoying the summer sun and earning a decent living.</p><p>While we found that we loved this job we also found, unfortunately, that we did not love the company we were working for nearly as much. There were a number of issues that forced us to leave the job we came to love and to begin our journey toward owning our own little piece of ice cream heaven. I'm not here to slander anyone so I am going to simply say that I do not agree with some of the business practices of my former employer and I am going to learn from what I feel are his mistakes and bring my community an ice cream truck that I can operate with pride.</p><p><b>Where your money (and ours) will go:</b></p><p>To fulfill our dream we need a total of about $10,000. Over the past few years we have been able to set aside around $5000. We are hoping to be able to raise enough to get out there this year but if not anything raised will go into the bank with what we have managed to save ourselves and perks for pledgers will be redeemable once we get rolling. Your generous contribution will go toward the following items:</p><p>-An ice cream truck (hopefully fully equipped with professional equipment)</p><p>-Any equipment we need to get the truck in shape</p><p>-Repairs/maintenance to ensure safety of truck and quality of product</p><p>-Repair fund so that an unexpected repair does not put us out of business any longer than necessary</p><p>-A facility (preferably with a garage) to repair and store equipment and products</p><p>-Insurance for equipment/facility</p><p>-Various fees for starting/incorporating business</p><p>-Starting stock (Ice cream, candy, pop, etc..)</p><p>-Application fees for solicitor's permits in towns of operation</p><p>-All other misc. equipment and costs</p><p>I have been planning this for a long time and have researched many hours to ensure our future success in this endeavor. I believe that with my experience and knowledge our ice cream truck will bring joy to the hearts of all we encounter for many years to come. Thank you for your time and don't forget to tell your friends about us! </p><br/></div>","Our dream:Hello-before I begin here I would like to thank you for reading this and for being on this website.

The joy we were able to bring to people who were seeing the truck for the first time and to people who saw us and remembered seeing a neighborhood ice cream man 50 years ago was amazing and reflected by the joy in our hearts at being able to spend our days together enjoying the summer sun and earning a decent living.While we found that we loved this job we also found, unfortunately, that we did not love the company we were working for nearly as much. There were a number of issues that forced us to leave the job we came to love and to begin our journey toward owning our own little piece of ice cream heaven. I'm not here to slander anyone so I am going to simply say that I do not agree with some of the business practices of my former employer and I am going to learn from what I feel are his mistakes and bring my community an ice cream truck that I can operate with pride.Where your money (and ours) will go:To fulfill our dream we need a total of about $10,000. Over the past few years we have been able to set aside around $5000. We are hoping to be able to raise enough to get out there this year but if not anything raised will go into the bank with what we have managed to save ourselves and perks for pledgers will be redeemable once we get rolling. Your generous contribution will go toward the following items:-An ice cream truck (hopefully fully equipped with professional equipment)-Any equipment we need to get the truck in shape-Repairs/maintenance to ensure safety of truck and quality of product-Repair fund so that an unexpected repair does not put us out of business any longer than necessary-A facility (preferably with a garage) to repair and store equipment and products-Insurance for equipment/facility-Various fees for starting/incorporating business-Starting stock (Ice cream, candy, pop, etc..)-Application fees for solicitor's permits in towns of operation-All other misc. equipment and costsI have been planning this for a long time and have researched many hours to ensure our future success in this endeavor. I believe that with my experience and knowledge our ice cream truck will bring joy to the hearts of all we encounter for many years to come. Thank you for your time and don't forget to tell your friends about us!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Getting More From Your Bottled Water</h3>
<p>     If you are health conscious and feel water is a key part of your daily health regimen, then you will want to help us introduce a new bottled water that has whole body benefits.   As a physician passionate about helping people stay healthy and age gracefully, I believe in leveraging natural products.   I know that if I can get my patients to follow a simple daily pro-health regimen, that the benefits will be additive, and improve health and longevity.  And one of most important tips I offer is to hydrate daily, with balanced, purified water, in addition to taking supportive nutrients like collagen and other naturally occurring bio-active peptides.  For years I would see new beverages and bottled waters hit the market, but none with clinically proven bio-active peptides.   So with your help we can change that and bring the first whole body collagen support water to market.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>     Our unique formulation will allow Collagen Renew to become the new standard in healthy hydration. Relative to our closest indirect competitor, coconut water,  Collagen Renew has virtually no calories, a clean natural taste and is priced 20% below the most popular coconut water brand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522811921/ela1puivf3mwauzv6slo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>    </p>
<p>     If you are active and are concerned about wear and tear to your joints, muscles and connective tissue, our hydration solution is one of your best options.  Robust collagen production can lead to improved rejuvenation and a more youthful appearance.  Several studies have shown improvements in skin, hair and nails with measurable objective and subjective results. </p>
<p>    </p>
<p>     We spent our time and worked with several nutritionists to evaluate a long list of supportive molecules with thousands of combinations to arrive at the selected formula.  Our ingredients are designed to work in synergy to boost production and support the longevity of your existing collagen through 3 mechanisms vs just one for a collagen only supplement.  We leverage select suppliers of hydrolyzed collagen from 2 sources to create a blend of type I, II and III collagen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522811827/xxdvt6bslkykppdao47k.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>      </p>
<p>     Our mix of premium collagen, L-Carnosine, minerals and electrolytes create the crisp alkaline character of our water.  Though several have tried, no company has been able yet to produce a clear, crisp, premium water that contains several grams of collagen and other supportive peptides found in Collagen Renew.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523632760/tqrwxi7h84oz8ctkxtmj.png"" src=""""/> *</p>
<p>     As we age we loose the cells (fibroblasts) that produce collagen so collagen supplementation becomes even more important to collagen production.  Our formula goes beyond supplementation and prolongs the life of existing fibroblasts by inhibiting the enzyme telomerase, via our second active ingredient L-Carnosine.  L-Carnosine also inhibits the stiffening and aging of existing collagen by inhibiting a process known as cross-linking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522812042/yw1baocm3kzixn73viiv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>     This support is most visible at the surface benefiting your body's largest organ, the skin.  And these benefits extend to your hair and nails.  To keep you looking naturally beautiful, most cosmetic specialists recommend daily nourishment and prevention of collagen damage.   Rather than spending a lot money after the fact, our water fits right into your daily health and beauty regimen and will pay dividends down the road.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     With your help, we can create a new standard in healthy hydration and support good health and longevity for millions of people who can benefit from something as simple as an enhanced water.  In the past 20 years, I have developed several healthcare related products so I am confident that with your help we will be successful and create a new category in bottled water the leads to better health.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any new venture is risky, and the bottled water business has its own risks related to branding and distribution that make it a tough market to enter.  We feel that the exposure and customer support provided by Indiegogo will help us in several ways.  From an R &amp; D perspective we have spent close to a year developing our unique collagen + L-carnosine complex that imparts the proven health benefits  along with the mineral and electrolyte formulation that allows our product to taste crisp and remain clear and clean.  We have also completed the packaging, banding, website and secured the proper IP in the form of trademark / trade-dress for the bottle design and brand name.   At this point, the biggest challenge before us is getting the initial production run completed and getting the word out that the product has arrived.  </p>

<h3>Who are you and where did you come from?</h3>
<p>For those of you who don't know who we are, allow us to introduce ourselves! We are Kaylee Klein and Chris Sweeney. Partners in business and life.</p>
<p>Kaylee grew up in Tampa, Florida, working in the food industry through high school and beyond. After displaying an interest in the culinary world, she decided to attend pastry school in New York City at the French Culinary Institute (now International Culinary Center) to become a little more well rounded in the intersecting worlds of savory and sweet.. She ended up falling in love with pastry during her schooling and moved on to work her butt off in some amazing restaurants and bakeries in New York City, Tampa and then Nashville, where she met Chris Sweeney.</p>

<p>---Chris doing what he does best, taste testing!---</p>
<p>We've now been in business for nearly two years and have reached capacity.  Like all things in the North Country, we must thrive... or die. So expand we must.  We have finally found the right spot for our expansion and will be moving on to Main Street, Littleton in November.</p>
<p>Where else can you get a seasonal pop tart with homemade sprinkles north of the notch?  Do you know of any establishment to support your duck fat breakfast sandwich addiction? Would you even survive without a carnival cookie stash?!?! We started this business wanting to bring big city tastes to a small town and translate it into a love and passion everyone feels when they take that first bite, and we think were succeeding. Starting a business is a wild and scary ride, but the relationships we've built over these past two years have helped shape what Crumb Bum Bakery has become. This is about community. This is about supporting each other. This is about working hard to bring something amazing to people you love. Everything we do, from birthday cakes, to huge wedding spreads, to farmers market baked goods, is a labor of love. Your reaction and continued attendance and support is the fruit of that labor! We wouldn't be here without the love and support of our community, and that will never be lost on us. We made a decision to invest in this awesome place we chose to call home, we hope you consider doing the same!</p>
<p>In order to provide our customers with the best experience and product we need your help. We are looking to raise $30,000 to renovate our newly acquired space and purchase new equipment.  Most of our existing equipment will follow us to Main Street, but to be open weekly, we need to drastically increase our production. Know what a dough sheeter is? It will allow us to make those delicious croissants you love way more frequently, while also saving Kaylee from some massive back problems one day! We also need a larger mixer, more refrigeration, and a second oven.</p>

<p>With YOUR help, it would be the greatest honor to be Littleton's Main Street Bakery &amp; Coffee Shop. Donate and you wont be disappointed! </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Dough Sheeter - $3000</p>
<p>60 qt Mixer - $5000</p>
<p>Licensing Fee's - $1000.00</p>
<p>Build Out Costs - $5500</p>
<p>Starting Inventory - $1000.00</p>
<p>Salary - $5,000.00 </p>
<p>Luckily we have very talented friends that will be contributing to our build out to keep costs low while achieving a professional, up scale and eccentric vibe.</p>
<p>We want to do this expansion the right way, and one way to achieve that is purchasing a <i>dough sheeter</i>. Not only will this save a bunch of time, it will also save the ONLY baker's back from rolling pounds and pounds of dough on the regular. It's truly a life changer! </p>
<p>Currently in our kitchen we only have a 20 qt Hobart mixer and a smaller professional kitchen aid. While we love both of them dearly it would save a bunch of time and energy to make bigger batches of our product, and that means investing in a <i>60 qt mixer</i>.</p>
<p>We are currently licensed in our appointment only production kitchen, but to make everything available to you in this new setting we need a whole new set of licenses. To sell beer and wine we need another license. Theres just a whole bunch of <i>licensing</i> that needs to get done OK!</p>
<p>We're lucky to be renting an already amazing space! We don't have too much to do as far as demolition, but there are a bunch of things we need to change around to have the absolute best kitchen and cafe aesthetic! We want to blow a wall back to expose the kitchen for open viewing. We want to build cozy booth seating for our guests as well as a bar to house our espresso machine, bakery display case and beer and wine refrigeration.  We want to take out the drop ceiling and expose the beautiful original tin tiled ceiling. We'll be saving a bunch of money by doing it ourselves, like we said we have some very talented friends who are on board to help but we need funding for supplies. It's going to look AMAZING if we pull this off!</p>
<p>We need enough money to build up our inventory! Baked goods don't take too many ingredients, flour, sugar, butter, chocolate, almond flour, dairy, cocoa powder.... well maybe they do. We're able to keep our costs low by being smart with our money. We buy good quality products but don't necessarily waste our time any pre-made add ons. We make absolutely everything ourselves, from the sprinkles that top the cinnamon rolls to the syrups we soak our cakes in. We don't ever sacrifice quality, we use King Arthur Flour, Cabot Butter, Callebaut Chocolate, vegetables and fruit however local we can get it, meat from our friends that farm it. All these things add up though. To create a bakery that's open 6 days a week we need a pretty serious amount of goods to start out. This would help chip away at that! </p>
<p>Last (but certainly not least) we need a salary for the two only employees/owners. We love what we do but we also need to support each other and our two year old son throughout this expansion. Kaylee is taking limited custom work throughout this time to focus on build out while Chris is working full time on this project. This money would help ensure that we pay our bills and our sons childcare throughout the first few months so the rest of the profit can go straight back into our growing business.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Besides t-shirts, stickers, and other perks for you donation, you get a place to meet, eat, and be part of growing Littleton. Crumb Bum Bakery and Coffee will be here for you caffeine needs and dessert desires!</p>
<h3>...and Thank You!</h3>
</div><div><p>We are making this expansion with or with out your help, but your donations will insure our ability to produce enough product to satisfy the masses and still have something left for you! If we don't raise enough money to buy new equipment we will have more limited hours and days that we can be open, so please be there for us so we can be there for you. We're SO excited to be a staple in our community but we need our communities support. Tell ALL your friends and bear with us through our growth spurt!

This money would help ensure that we pay our bills and our sons childcare throughout the first few months so the rest of the profit can go straight back into our growing business.
 
What You Get
Besides t-shirts, stickers, and other perks for you donation, you get a place to meet, eat, and be part of growing Littleton. Crumb Bum Bakery and Coffee will be here for you caffeine needs and dessert desires!
...and Thank You!
We are making this expansion with or with out your help, but your donations will insure our ability to produce enough product to satisfy the masses and still have something left for you! If we don't raise enough money to buy new equipment we will have more limited hours and days that we can be open, so please be there for us so we can be there for you. We're SO excited to be a staple in our community but we need our communities support. Tell ALL your friends and bear with us through our growth spurt! We'll see you on Main Street in November!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign
