<p>Funds are to be<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> used for two things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacture the injection molds  ($40K)</li>
<li>Manufacture 1000 units  ($40K)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>$20K has already been raised!</u></p>
<p><strong>Total Funding needed:  $60K    </strong></p>
<p>If the funding goal is not reached - all funds will go towards manufacture of the injection molds.  Another Indiegogo crowdfunding will then take place until all funds are achieved.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get:</h3>
<p>For $100 you get a Revolver, a rear spacer (so that both feet are the same level), and a bag of screws / washers for installing The Revolver onto your snowboard!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<p>This device is an adapter plate that fits between the snowboard and the snowboard binding.  Once installed, you simply pull the locking pin up, rotate your foot where you want it, and release the pin.  That's it!</p>
<p>For the more adventurous - if you want to rotate your front foot while snowboarding, just pull the pin, rotate the pin 90 degrees and your foot is then free to move between 0 and 90 degrees!  Don't worry, there is a safety mechanism that keeps your foot from rotating too far.</p>
<p>Snowboarding with the device unlocked is like riding a bike for the first time.  At first you are a bit unsure - but after a couple of runs you get the hang of it!  Once you try it you'll never go back!!!</p>
<p>Also - after about 30-50 days of riding the low-friction pucks that exist between the two plates will wear down.  These pucks can easily be raised up to take up any slack that exists.  There is a video of how to do this on the website:   See  <a href=""http://www.revolvergear.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.revolvergear.com</a> ""Instructions"" tab.</p>

Silverlight socks are now available for regular purchase at: https://silverlight.store/product/silverlight-s... Introducing Ventury Silverlight SocksThe Problem If you’ve ever been on the trail walking with moist or wet feet, with your socks incessantly rubbing the skin bare, and you get to camp or home and discover you have blisters from the day’s activities. Then you know why these socks needed to be made.
If you’ve ever been enjoying a hike and your socks slip down and bunch up under your foot. You also know exactly why these socks needed to be made.If you’ve ever made it to camp or back home, pulled off your shoes/boots (ready for a nice relaxing foot rub), and discovered the ungodly stench and odor wafting from your socks with what looks like the entire trails dirt and leafs stuck onto your socks. Then you REALLY know why these socks needed to be made!If you’ve ever set out on a hiking trip - ready to revel in the wonders of nature -  only to have to cut it short because of foot pain. Then you know WHY these socks needed to be made.   Nearly 85% of over 850 hikers surveyed said their #1 frustration was wet or moist feet while hiking.Why? It leads to blisters and foot pain that can cut an amazing hiking trip short.Sometimes it feels like “it’s impossible to find a solution” in the current socks available.Time and time again I had chats with fellow hikers and heard frequently of trips cut short, simply because the foot pain was too great. It should not be that we would ever need to turn back on a great adventure. Sadly it's the case for too many. This is why the Ventury Silverlight hiking sock was created.  Silver ion's kill bacteria preventing odor from ever having a chance. The same tech used by astronauts and medical professionals to prevent bacteria build up and growth is in Silverlight hiking socks. Not only does bacteria cause the odor that makes the wild animals run away from you in fear, but it also is a leading cause of foot-rot. With Ventury Silverlight socks we're getting rid of the bacteria so you can breathe easy and have rested blister-free feet. The entire sock is designed to prevent all the major causes of blisters on the trail. Gone are the days of taking your socks off after a days hike - to give your feet a rest - only to reveal painful blisters. Our struggle in creating the Ventury Silverlight sock was in creating a sock that could do all the work in preventing blisters from ever having the chance to form. We are proud to say that when it comes to every major cause of blisters from socks Silverlight socks completely eliminate those causes. The combination of Merino wool softly caressing your feet mixed with the seamless stitching creates the ultimate comfort on the trail. Your foot won't even notice the seems even after 6 hours of hiking.Seamless stitching in the toe box reduces rubbing in sensitive areas keeping your skin free of painful blisters that can throw off your hiking schedule.

At the end we all end up asking ourselves the same old questions: 
How do I pack my bag? How do I keep it organized?
Where can I fit my jeans on my backpack?
Where can put my dirty clothes? 
How do I take my things on a biking/motorcycle trip? 
There must be a better way of solving this problem. Packing cubes, vacuum bags, or even Zip-Lock bags are not quite as practical as they seem and they end up being just half way solutions. The world is in need for a new generation of TRAVEL ORGANISERS that are clever, lightweight, waterproof and work on every type of trip.   

No Organisation, No Overview: One big compartment to organize everything

Laborious & Annoying: To get to the right T-Shirt, you might need to take everything out of the suitcase/ backpack. (Somehow you always want the Shirt at the bottom.)

Inconvenient: Where to store your clothes while staying in a hotel, a hostel, or while camping? You most likely just leave everything in your suitcase/backpack.

Dirty & Wet Floors, bathrooms can be dirty and wet. So where to put the fresh clothes that they stay clean and dry?

Different sized plastic bags: Or even zip-lock bags, are a desperate try to organise yourself - same problem: You need to pull all clothes out again to get to one T-Shirt. Most times you don't even know what's inside anymore, due to a lack of overview.

Space problem: You want to travel with only your backpack? All your clothes, laptop, cosmetic bag, cables (even shoes) in a backpack? I think you would need an extra bag.

Your clothes stay organized, with overview and super-quick access.
Travel with only one backpack! Save space - Carrying your clothes under your backpack.
Save time and nerves, no need to search for your favorite T-Shirt.

Staying flexible and carrying your clothes the way you want.
GREAT, that you value well-thought, practical and multifunctional travel gear! The Hang&Roll was designed with 8 separate pockets to keep you organized and pack a ton of stuff for extended trips. Simply open one flap, grab the T-Shirt you like - in seconds - with one hand. Save your time and nerves! There is no need to even touch any other clothes and possibly fold them again. Just hang the HANG&ROLL anywhere you are. Set-up in seconds, your clothes stay clean, dry and even nicely folded in their pockets. It's time to go home? Just roll the HANG&ROLL together and off you go. Forget about carrying a messy backpack, or even two separate bags, to fit all your stuff? Just outsource your clothes, attach the HANG&ROLL under your backpack with the clips and you have plenty of space inside the backpack. Just CARRY IT everywhere...  Introducing our new ADD-ONS: Drybag, Shoulder Strap & Molle D-Rings The DRYBAG , made out of premium 100% waterproof fabric is the perfect fitting the for HANG&ROLL. The Drybag can also be used on this own. It works perfectly as a carry bag. If you have an item that needs water protection or takes too much space inside the backpack, f.e. big sweater, pair of shoes or a big towel for the beach. Just throw it inside and take it with you!Just want to carry your clothes over the shoulder? Here you go! You don’t need a backpack anymore. Throw the Hang&Roll over your shoulder, and your ready to go. An easily attachable, sturdy rope with leather endings. Just a clever tipp and even more convenient way to attach the Hang&Roll or the Drybag to your backpack.

The more clothes to put into the Hang&Roll, the bigger the roll ends up being in the end.
Why not only big pockets? We decided on the different sized pockets, that you can actually roll everything well together and the HANG&ROLL dosen't end up being extremely big.
Anti-Slip-Loop is actually a loop for the strap that they don't slip off! Not for carrying the HANG&ROLL, that's what's the handle is for.
The pockets are not big enough for huge comfy winter-sweaters, nor jackets or shoes. Our Tipp:

As a photographer since high school and a traveler since college, he always had the strange ability to find Jewish sites by pure chance. <i> As an immigrant he learned to blend in almost anywhere and with the ability to speak Russian, English, French and Spanish, he was able to enter communities others could not, gain their trust and tell their stories.</i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Having often been the only Jew in a large company of people, he often had the ability and pleasure to answer people's questions about Judaism which they were afraid to ask before. That began creation of a blog called <a href=""www.samthejewishguy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SamTheJewishGuy</a>.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span></span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442210688/qfzsgdtf1u9zeiahduok.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/> It was around 2009 that he recognized that he can put a lot of talents together to tell a story in a way that hasn't been told before and that he was uniquely suited to tell. Sam felt that it was necessary to go to the source to understand and show Jewish people, their Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and secular neighbors in a way that explains how it is that they all live together, how they get along and how they influenced each other to create such unique and diverse cultures. The idea is understanding one another is what brings about peace. Understanding one another allows people to see that we all would be the same as our neighbor if we lived in the place they lived, with that environment that surrounded them and the people who they interacted with, that idea drove Sam and this book and is embodied in every<a href=""#34081182"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by currency""> </a>single picture he took.<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what Our Story shows; that we are all part of one giant quilt, that the colors bleed into each other and that we are all much more alike that we are different. </p><p>In 2012, an opportunity presented itself. Sam was in between jobs and applying for NASA Astronaut program. It was while waiting for NASA to review that created <a href=""www.ourjewishstory.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OurJewishStory</a>. Sam packed up his things, got in a car, and drove to New York. From there he flew to London, then Kiev and kept going until I arrived in Hong Kong and then back in San Diego.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442210889/fld8znj10vwvrx7rgkrc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> He found work back home but I wasn't done. So he got back on the road and kept going through Central America and on to Columbia. There were difficulties and once again he ran out of money and had to come back home with Argentina and Brazil still on the list. He was able to go back to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil thanks to a JDC Entwine trip that </span>occurred<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> just in time. </span></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With the major photography done and a year having passed by, he worked for two years designing the book with Kathleen Stemley, Sue Benson and Paula Micallef, writing and editing with Clayton Beach and Olga Litvin and finally printing the book.

I wanted the book to be affordable to anyone. This is why we decided to do an all or nothing campaign. </div><div>What does that mean?<br/>IndieGoGo is a crowdfunding campaign. We set a goal of $8,000 in 35 days to print 200 books. If we don't meet the goal, then the money is returned to you, the funders. The sad part of course, is that no one gets the books either...  At the same time, we only print the books that are pre-ordered. In the words of my London<a href=""#34207571"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by currency""> </a>Hostel hostess: ""If you're not fast, you're last.""  And that  means that the risk for you is that if you wait, you may not get the book when we do meet the goal. </div><div><br/></div><div>But, if you're early to help, you get better perks! Why? </div><div>Because the way IndieGoGo works is that the faster you start the easier it is to meet the goal so the first week and especially the first days <b>ARE CRITICAL</b>. That's why we will be super generous and awesome to our first founders, because you're brave. If you found out about us late, we'll still be cool and if you share us, and get friends and relatives in, we will thank you for being an amazing supporters of creating a better world through knowledge and because you help us get our reach and we show people that this will happen and they are more likely to buy a book too, and help us all reach our goal of getting this book to every possible coffee table.</div><div><br/></div><h2>What You Get</h2><div>

Thus you will be one of the first to hear their stories and learn from them and about them as well as help preserve their culture and memory as many may soon cease to exist.<br/></p><p>If you come in early, we will send you cool early bird gifts like signing the book and more.

<h2>Why Not Use a Publisher?</h2>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for a publisher but the market is small and the book is neither a novel nor is it pure photography. It is neither religious nor secular. It is not a history or autobiographical. In essence, it is for everyone and yet it does not fit in any specific genre. It fits everywhere and no where, similar to the Jewish people as a friend of mine noted.</p><p>Furthermore, I wanted the book to be affordable. I wanted it to be under $30 so anyone could afford it. </p><p>So this way we all win, the book is not expensive and it is created not just by me, but by all of us, we all get to have a hand it it's creation. The only problem is, we only have a month to find you and to tell all your friends and family members.... </p><p>So spread the word! While you can. :)</p><p>However, if you don't believe that we could have published the book, we have had some great feedback from publishers. In fact we were one of the finalists for Maple Lane Book Publisher.

Even if you're not Jewish, the photographs will make you want to travel the world if you don't already have the travel bug and will give you a glimpse into the Jewish world. It is a great conversation piece and something to show when a you have a Jewish in-law, boss or friend. It is written in easy to understand non-academic English giving anyone a primer on Jewish laws and customs. I realize that sometimes it feels like the only thing you know about Jews is that they don't eat bacon, there's a lot more to Jewish culture than that, and you can find out about it in this book.</p><p>My thinking is that one must understand Jewish culture if one is to understand the philosophy that created Islam and Christianity. Jews contributed to many countries so you cannot recreate success of Einstein and Freud if you don't know where these men came from. So it helps everyone to know they background, history and culture to keep innovating and progressing.  </p><p>But really, most importantly, it is filled with beautiful pictures of modern life around the globe including churches, mosques and temples that you will love taking a look at again and again.</p><div></div><div>

</div><h2>But I Was Brought Up Jewish.<br/>
</h2><div>If you were brought up Jewish, the upbringing you had is very particular to that of your country and your parents. The customs and food and rituals that you and your family and community assume to be universal are only one unique culture of many diverse and unique customs and rituals that differ from country to country and home to home. This book allows you to marvel at the synagogues built across the world, the foods eaten on other continent, the traditions that look and feel the same but different and foreign at the same time. This book will give you an insight into the reason why you as a Jew are the way you are, why Israel is so diverse and unique and what makes you so similar to all other people around you that if you go to a synagogue across the world, you feel at home and like a fish out of water at the same time.  </div><div>More importantly, you will help create a book that shows how instrumental your culture and religion was to so many places, you will help other Jewish people learn about themselves. I believe that what your parents and ancestors did is really important for the world to know and I need help to make sure we can get that information out to as many people as possible.</div><div>

Your Story, the coffee table book shows how the Jewish people, although small in number (14 million today) came to impacted the world in politics, science, art and religion. The book describes how Jews were able to learn from people around the world, preserve their heritage and create a new future in-spite of set backs. Travel with the photographer and blogger SamTheJewishGuy to over 30 countries to and see what cultural traits are similar and different around the world that let Jewish people succeed and may help other people around the world, succeed as well.


Our Story, Our Sipur (Hebrew for Story) is a book with photographs of life and traditions in over 30 countries taken over the course of one year from a Jewish perspective showing how Jewish people soaked up cultures of their host countries during their time of exile, how they adapted to survive in vastly diverse and different environments and how they kept the core of their teachings in spite of two Millenia of exile. We picked over 450 pictures picked out of thousands and published them in full color inside 200 pages with descriptions and explanations of each country, its history and a description of Jewish customs and traditions and how they resemble and differ depending on the country where they are practiced. The book is a hard-bound and full color 8.5""x11"" which giving a unique glimpse into individuals, homes, communities and countries around the world. 

Gondar-Ethiopia






Singapore
While there have been a few other books by other photographers which focused on the Jewish culture and books which combined photographs by many photographers, none have done it quite like this.

Mexico City 
This book is different as it focuses on looking at triumphs and failures and unique cultural aspects of Jewish people around the world created by a single photographer with a singular vision in one year across six continents. 

Crown Heights, Brooklyn
The book acts as a slice in time of history and cultures during changing times. As the world quickly changes, the book will remain a time capsule for years to come that one can go back to and understand a unique point in human history that will never repeat again.

Crakow-Poland
This is done by having the book organized by country and the Jewish calendar describing various celebrations, customs and traditions and their origin, explaining how those traditions aided Jewish adaptability and survival and how they helped the cultures around them to progress as a society. 

Gondar- Ethiopia
Thus it is written and photographed in such a way as to allow all people of all ethnicities and faiths to discover something new about themselves and the people they thought they knew. 

Gondar-Ethiopia

It looks at successes and failures of Jewish people for all of us to learn from, and does so with beautiful photography from the mountains of Africa to the fields of Europe and the cityscapes of North and South America.


The Story of Our StorySam Litvin was born in Ukraine in 1982 and moved to California in 1992. As a photographer since high school and a traveler since college, he always had the strange ability to find Jewish sites by pure chance.  As an immigrant he learned to blend in almost anywhere and with the ability to speak Russian, English, French and Spanish, he was able to enter communities others could not, gain their trust and tell their stories. Having often been the only Jew in a large company of people, he often had the ability and pleasure to answer people's questions about Judaism which they were afraid to ask before. That began creation of a blog called SamTheJewishGuy.
 It was around 2009 that he recognized that he can put a lot of talents together to tell a story in a way that hasn't been told before and that he was uniquely suited to tell. Sam felt that it was necessary to go to the source to understand and show Jewish people, their Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and secular neighbors in a way that explains how it is that they all live together, how they get along and how they influenced each other to create such unique and diverse cultures. The idea is understanding one another is what brings about peace. Understanding one another allows people to see that we all would be the same as our neighbor if we lived in the place they lived, with that environment that surrounded them and the people who they interacted with, that idea drove Sam and this book and is embodied in every single picture he took.

This is what Our Story shows; that we are all part of one giant quilt, that the colors bleed into each other and that we are all much more alike that we are different. In 2012, an opportunity presented itself. Sam was in between jobs and applying for NASA Astronaut program. It was while waiting for NASA to review that created OurJewishStory. Sam packed up his things, got in a car, and drove to New York. From there he flew to London, then Kiev and kept going until I arrived in Hong Kong and then back in San Diego. He found work back home but I wasn't done. So he got back on the road and kept going through Central America and on to Columbia. There were difficulties and once again he ran out of money and had to come back home with Argentina and Brazil still on the list. He was able to go back to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil thanks to a JDC Entwine trip that occurred just in time. With the major photography done and a year having passed by, he worked for two years designing the book with Kathleen Stemley, Sue Benson and Paula Micallef, writing and editing with Clayton Beach and Olga Litvin and finally printing the book. That is how this book got to you and now it is your chance to get it at the price that is affordable and possible and make this book, all its pictures lessons and stories available for the world. Ideas and books change the world, why not this one. And if it doesn't, then at least we tried, and that counts for a lot.How Does This Work?Before IndieGoGo, the only possibilities were publishing and self publishing. Both of those options would be expensive for you. I wanted the book to be affordable to anyone. This is why we decided to do an all or nothing campaign. What does that mean?IndieGoGo is a crowdfunding campaign. We set a goal of $8,000 in 35 days to print 200 books. If we don't meet the goal, then the money is returned to you, the funders. The sad part of course, is that no one gets the books either...  At the same time, we only print the books that are pre-ordered. In the words of my London Hostel hostess: ""If you're not fast, you're last.""  And that  means that the risk for you is that if you wait, you may not get the book when we do meet the goal. But, if you're early to help, you get better perks! Why? Because the way IndieGoGo works is that the faster you start the easier it is to meet the goal so the first week and especially the first days ARE CRITICAL. That's why we will be super generous and awesome to our first founders, because you're brave. If you found out about us late, we'll still be cool and if you share us, and get friends and relatives in, we will thank you for being an amazing supporters of creating a better world through knowledge and because you help us get our reach and we show people that this will happen and they are more likely to buy a book too, and help us all reach our goal of getting this book to every possible coffee table.What You Get



 I worked together with great editors, designers and artists to create a great book to hold hundreds out of the thousands of pictures and to weave a story about each place in between the photographs. We have a local printer to make a beautiful 200 page book with a long-lasting hard-cover and all for less than $25.00.I've finished all of the traveling, writing and photographs, so it is your turn to show that you would like this book to be at your home. Help us with printing, making Our Story, Your Story.Inside the Our Story book, you will see photographs of places few have been to before as I gained unprecedented access to communities that have rarely opened to strangers. Thus you will be one of the first to hear their stories and learn from them and about them as well as help preserve their culture and memory as many may soon cease to exist.If you come in early, we will send you cool early bird gifts like signing the book and more. So come in early to ensure that we reach our goal in time.



   To see more of the book, you can find a preview on Our Story, Our Sipur,  The Our Jewish Story Book on SCRIBD by Sam Litvin





What Countries Does The Book Include?
I can't embed the map, but I can put images. Click on the google map which is interactive and includes videos, photos, blog posts and interviews. Or you can take a look at the Table of Contents of the book to see all the amazing places where I took pictures.




Why Not Use a Publisher?


I looked for a publisher but the market is small and the book is neither a novel nor is it pure photography. It is neither religious nor secular. It is not a history or autobiographical. In essence, it is for everyone and yet it does not fit in any specific genre. It fits everywhere and no where, similar to the Jewish people as a friend of mine noted.Furthermore, I wanted the book to be affordable. I wanted it to be under $30 so anyone could afford it. So this way we all win, the book is not expensive and it is created not just by me, but by all of us, we all get to have a hand it it's creation. The only problem is, we only have a month to find you and to tell all your friends and family members.... So spread the word! While you can. :)However, if you don't believe that we could have published the book, we have had some great feedback from publishers. In fact we were one of the finalists for Maple Lane Book Publisher. You can read their review of Our Story  by clicking on this link.



Concerns:What happens if we sell more than 200 books?Well, great things start to happen at past 200 books. The price comes down and once we get to 1000 copies, all shipping to US becomes free and 10 dollars off shipping around the world!!!!!! 
But I'm Not Jewish.
Even if you're not Jewish, you can still buy this book because this book is for anyone. Even if you're not Jewish, the photographs will make you want to travel the world if you don't already have the travel bug and will give you a glimpse into the Jewish world. It is a great conversation piece and something to show when a you have a Jewish in-law, boss or friend. It is written in easy to understand non-academic English giving anyone a primer on Jewish laws and customs. I realize that sometimes it feels like the only thing you know about Jews is that they don't eat bacon, there's a lot more to Jewish culture than that, and you can find out about it in this book.My thinking is that one must understand Jewish culture if one is to understand the philosophy that created Islam and Christianity. Jews contributed to many countries so you cannot recreate success of Einstein and Freud if you don't know where these men came from. So it helps everyone to know they background, history and culture to keep innovating and progressing.  But really, most importantly, it is filled with beautiful pictures of modern life around the globe including churches, mosques and temples that you will love taking a look at again and again.

But I Was Brought Up Jewish.
If you were brought up Jewish, the upbringing you had is very particular to that of your country and your parents. The customs and food and rituals that you and your family and community assume to be universal are only one unique culture of many diverse and unique customs and rituals that differ from country to country and home to home. This book allows you to marvel at the synagogues built across the world, the foods eaten on other continent, the traditions that look and feel the same but different and foreign at the same time. This book will give you an insight into the reason why you as a Jew are the way you are, why Israel is so diverse and unique and what makes you so similar to all other people around you that if you go to a synagogue across the world, you feel at home and like a fish out of water at the same time.  More importantly, you will help create a book that shows how instrumental your culture and religion was to so many places, you will help other Jewish people learn about themselves. I believe that what your parents and ancestors did is really important for the world to know and I need help to make sure we can get that information out to as many people as possible.



Why I Should I Get it Now? Can I wait till later?
No you can't. We have 35 days to raise the funds needed to print a batch. If we don't raise the funds, the books aren't printed. If you don't donate in time you don't get the book. Of course if we surpass, that is a different story.But even if we surpass the goal and you don't buy the book, you may be left out. Because we will only make one print run and thus if you're not fast, you'r last. And that might mean that you will be left without a book. So don't stand on the sidelines, join us, and make the world a more informed place, today.Plus, remember, there might be people stand on the sidelines thinking about buying the book but they want to see others buy first. Be the leader, show initiative, show that you believe in Our Story and help us succeed. Every dollar we get will bring another dollar. So the sooner you come in the more likely we are to meet and exceed the goal. 


$8000 is what we need to print 200 books, pay for taxes, fees and the miscellaneous costs that might come up during campaign. I have spent over $25,000 of my own personal money on this project. My friends and family have helped me a lot: monetarily and spiritually. It is now the readers’ turn to buy and enjoy the book, learn about the stories and spread the spirit of the book: peace through understanding.

By buying the Our Story book, regardless of your religion or heritage, you will find out about your country and your part of the world and you will directly contribute to making this book a reality for others who love history, culture, photography and travel.  You will find out how your country impacted the Jewish people and how you were impacted by Judaism. You will find out about how Jewish people succeeded to create amazing communities in some places, sometimes, and failed in others.  Thereby you will learn and help others learn how you can create similar success and avoid failures. You will see how Jewish people and their neighbors combined the old Israeli traditions with the traditions around them to create cultures unique to every country and every continent and thus how you are every day by learning from others are creating a new culture every day.

You will find out about how Jewish culture became part of the greater world and you will find out things about Jewish culture that you never knew before, from its ancient and modern history to its traditions that only the most religious were privy to before.

You will step into over 30 countries countries and have a glimpse of what it is like to live and breathe in a different world. 

In a way, you will take a step into today, by seeing a snapshot of Jewish diaspora around the world in 2012 and at the same time, take a step into the world of 2000 years ago that managed to exist in spite of Inquisition, Pogroms and Holocaust. 


Risks & Challenges
The future printer has been identified, the book has been designed, the photography and writing is done. If we meet the goal, you will get the book and so there is no risk to you.

As the Pole star is a guiding star for travelers, Polaris displays the navigation information and speed of the smart mobility on a road with high-quality laser.Polaris leads the rider's attention to the rider's front to widen the rider's vision and secures the rider's safety.


 50mW high energy green laser projects navigation information on a road. A driver does not have to look smartphone or handle bar but front for identifying driving information. This maximizes driver’s safety.There are two reasons for laser projection rather than LED. First, laser is a beam of light while LED spreads light beans to all over the space. Therefore, laser projection does not require a focusing lens as LED in this case.Second, laser projections has higher visibility than LED.A green laser light bean has a wave length of 532 nm which is highly visible in both day and night.Therefore, we applied laser than LED even if laser costs more than LED and laser is harder to use than LED. Polaris is for bicycle and various smart mobility (Segway, Nine bot, electric wheel, and electric kick board). Polaris is suitable for an electric wheel, a popular smart mobility recently. The electric wheel is difficult for mounting a navigation equipment providing riding information. Polaris can be mounted on such electric wheel and provide riding information and navigation information. In this way, Polaris helps a rider control speeds. A digital 3-axes accelerometer turns off the power of Polaris if the angle between projection and road exceeds a certain limit. This feature prevents light pollution and saves battery power. The angle limit can be customized in Option.Polaris is turned off if riding is halt for a certain period of time and saves the battery power (The period can be set in Option) Polaris uses high energy laser but lithium polymer battery (2000mAh) so that it guarantees the usage time more than 6-8 hours.Polaris, with its coupled smartphone application, enables a rider to easily identify riding information such as speed, distance, time, and battery charge in real time. Navigation information can be easily accessed. The information is on directions, the distance from destination, the target time, and the location of a friend. Polaris guarantees IP65 which is suitable water proof and vibration proof for outdoor. Polaris notices the location of a rider to pedestrians and vehicles and prevents accidents. Hexagon-shaped aluminum body is chic. Detachable mount is convenient. Polaris supports every smart mobility including a bicycle.Polaris connects to a smartphone application with Bluetooth and shares riding information and navigation information.Polaris Smartphone Application will support iOS and Android. Polaris projects information such as the current speed, time, altitude, max speed at a look. Polaris Provides navigation specialized in a bicycle and a personal electric vehicle rather than a car

<p>Hi my name is Howard K Jang, I'm 25 years old. And i am the head Leader of my ministry called OCEM. (Onnuree Church English Ministry).</p>
<p>I recently opened my own tutoring center to help parents who cannot afford to send their children to after school program. It's been an amazing experience to be able to help children understand the simple concept of mathematics and reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyways I got an opportunity to go to a church plant pioneering school and hands on mission training for the summer. The school is part of YWAM (Youth with a mission) located in Kansas City. And the outreach mission will be in India.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s a link for more information.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ywamkansascity.com/Groups/1000086533/Church_Pioneering_School.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ywamkansascity.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>So time to get down and dirty. Why do I need $5000.00? <br/> $2000 is for the training part. Which includes 2 months of room, board and tuition. I know, that’s pretty cheap~ I know some of you guys are thinking of going too now right? The more the merrier. =]</p>
<p>$3000 is for the mission part. We are going to be purchasing our ticket as a group. I asked the school to break down the prices for me so that I know your donation will really go into the cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1800 is for plane tickets</li>
<li>$80 dollars is for a visa</li>
<li>$200 for the long transportation to the rural city we will be staying at.</li>
<li>The rest will be used for supplies, food, shelter, vaccines, and etc...</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As some of you guys know my life motto is Love God and Love People. The life impact I will get out of this and the chance to help someone in a different country will be a life experience.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I’m not asking every one for financial help. Times are hard and I get that. At times like this I wish I knew 5000 friends, so I can ask all of them for a dollar. That would be fun.  But even a simple email word of encouragement or even prayer support would be amazing.</p>
<p>I know that God will provide. He has already brought me thus far. This is just a very small step to go somewhere further.</p>
<p>Anyways thank you for reading this.</p>
<p>I’ll be posting a video very soon saying the same exact thing.</p>
<p>LOVE GOD ~</p>
<p>LOVE PEOPLE~</p>
<p> </p>

Anyways I got an opportunity to go to a church plant pioneering school and hands on mission training for the summer. The school is part of YWAM (Youth with a mission) located in Kansas City. And the outreach mission will be in India.
 
Here’s a link for more information.
http://www.ywamkansascity.com/
 
What We Need & What You Get
So time to get down and dirty. Why do I need $5000.00?  $2000 is for the training part. Which includes 2 months of room, board and tuition. I know, that’s pretty cheap~ I know some of you guys are thinking of going too now right? The more the merrier. =]
$3000 is for the mission part. We are going to be purchasing our ticket as a group. I asked the school to break down the prices for me so that I know your donation will really go into the cause.

$1800 is for plane tickets
$80 dollars is for a visa
$200 for the long transportation to the rural city we will be staying at.
The rest will be used for supplies, food, shelter, vaccines, and etc...
The Impact
As some of you guys know my life motto is Love God and Love People. The life impact I will get out of this and the chance to help someone in a different country will be a life experience.
Other Ways You Can Help
I’m not asking every one for financial help. Times are hard and I get that. At times like this I wish I knew 5000 friends, so I can ask all of them for a dollar. That would be fun.  But even a simple email word of encouragement or even prayer support would be amazing.
I know that God will provide. He has already brought me thus far. This is just a very small step to go somewhere further.
Anyways thank you for reading this.
I’ll be posting a video very soon saying the same exact thing.
LOVE GOD ~
LOVE PEOPLE~

You’ll get really awesome perks by helping us today: As mentioned, a limited number of early customers will be able to get the charcoal chimney In Time for the Holidays this year, and we’re also offering FREE BBQ Dragon fans with some of the perks. These fans retail for $49.95! We’re also including FREE boxes of wax fire-starters and FREE grill brushes with some perks, because we want to share our excitement about the Chimney of Insanity and, hey, it feels more like a party when you get free stuff.

These are top-quality wax and sawdust fire starters that work great in the side of your Chimney of Insanity, and can also be used to start campfires, fire places, and fire pits. The Classic Grill Brush is an old stand-by, and something you know you need, because yours is all worn out and clogged with grease, isn't it?


We’ve asked our factory to ship a limited number of charcoal chimneys to us in time to get them to “Early Bird” customers IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. After these limited perks are gone, the Chimney of Insanity and other perks will be available 90 days after the close of our campaign.




We have created and already paid for our tooling – we’re asking you to help us pay for the actual production costs and freight of our first production run, and be the first to try this terrific chimney.
Here's the Cost Breakdown: $10,000 of our $15,000 goal pays for the first production run, and the remaining $5000 pays for the container shipping to get the product here. Yes, it's that expensive to ship!

At BBQ Dragon we’re on a constant quest to make better grilling tools – unique products that make barbecue easier, faster, and more fun.We’re Bruce and George Prior, creators of the BBQ Dragon fan, which we released in 2013. The BBQ Dragon set a high bar: It was a truly new and unique barbecue product that grilling and BBQ chefs around the world love. With the success of the BBQ Dragon, we now work with a great factory, and an excellent U.S. warehouse and shipping department, and have been able to focus the company’s attention on designing and testing new barbecue tools and accessories. Our solid foundation and experience in manufacturing and logistics gives us confidence that we will be able deliver the Chimney of Insanity to you by our projected delivery dates, as well as being confident that this is a high-quality product that will work as expected and last a long time.​



Can also be used like a normal chimney – just stuff newspaper in the bottom and light as usual.
Additional newspaper can then be inserted in the side hole when the first newspaper burns down.
Fire-starters like wax sticks, packets, or cubes work GREAT in the side hole, much better than with a normal chimney.
The side hole creates a draft when used with fire-starters, lighting the charcoal faster
Using a fan like the BBQ Dragon in the side hole reduces the start time to MINUTES!
You can also just blow into the hole to help get the coals started faster.
High-quality construction, full heat-shield, nylon handle.
Designed to be the best-looking and best-working chimney you’ve ever owned, or money back.
Here is a side-by side comparison of the Chimney of Insanity and an old-style chimney. Both chimneys were started with newspaper, the old-style one was actually lit first to give the poor old fellow a head-start, and the results are pretty startling:Exploding into the outdoor cooking market in 2013, the BBQ Dragon Fire and Charcoal Supercharger was the first hands-free, cordless, fully adjustable grill fan ever available. Here are some of the BBQ Dragon’s top awards:WINNER: “Best New Barbecue Accessory,” 2013 National Hardware ShowWINNER: Science Channel’s TV Show, “All-American Makers”WINNER: “Best New Outdoor Tech,” 2015 National Hardware ShowBRONZE WINNER: “Outdoor Living Best in Show,” 2015 National Hardware ShowCheck out the BBQ Dragon in this video:

The chimney has been tested, tooling is completed, and production is nearly complete, so there is little or no risk that we will not complete the manufacturing stage. We are an experienced company with a track record of success, so you can be confident that we will deliver to you what we promise.We have an excellent relationship with our factory and the product will be shipped on time. The schedule for our container shipping puts an early small shipment of chimneys in our Colorado warehouse well in time for us to ship them to you by Christmas, and we are confident that our fulfillment warehouse can ship them to you quickly when they are available. There is a small risk for backers of our “In Time for the Holidays” perks that there could be an unexpected container shipping delay, like the container gets held up in the Long Beach port, for example. This risk could delay those holiday deliveries. The same small risk of a delayed delivery exists for the remainder of the perks which are scheduled to be shipped to you 90 days from the completion of our campaign, but you can feel confident that we will manufacture and deliver your Chimney of Insanity as promised. We are brothers Bruce and George Prior, the founders of BBQ Dragon and the creators of the BBQ Dragon Fire Supercharger and other grilling accessories. We manage the design and engineering of new products, Tevie Tillman is our amazing Administration Manager, and Josh Zlaget is in charge of tech and IT. We all love barbecue, tailgating, and family.We proudly put customers first, and we guarantee our products and back them with excellent service. Check out any of our online reviews, like on Amazon, to see how we stand behind our quality products.The Chimney of Insanity is manufactured by the same excellent factory in China that makes our BBQ Dragon fan. We have worked with them for three years now. They produce very high-quality products for us, and from our visits to the factory and our relationships with the workers and owners, we have also learned that they're a great group of people. Check out these great photos of the production line producing our chimneys. We believe that this pride in workplace translates into great products.1. When do you expect to ship the ""In Time for Holidays"" Perks?ANSWER: We expect to have the chimneys in our warehouse and begin shipping by early December.2. What is the chimney made out of?ANSWER: Galvanized steel with a nylon handle.3. How fast is the chimney when used with a BBQ Dragon? ANSWER: In our tests, we began cooking over the fully-lit charcoal in 9 minutes.4. What if I don't have a BBQ Dragon fan?ANSWER: No problem, even just blowing into the side hole in the early stages of ignition speeds lighting tremendously. You can also use a hair-dryer, a small electric fan, a heat gun, an air compressor, leaf-blower, etc.5. Can I still use this like newspaper, like my old chimney? ANSWER: Yes, and it will still work better. If your chimney doesn't start as quickly as you like after the first round of paper, you can stick extra paper into the side hole to get it going again, without having to lift that full and partially-hot chimney.6. How much charcoal does the chimney hold?ANSWER: Enough to cook one meal, or approximately the amount that half-covers the grate in a kettle for ""two-zone"" cooking.​​
Please tell your friends and family who love grilling about the Chimney of Insanity. This chimney is the perfect gift for the ""grill masters"" in your life. Don't forget that Indiegogo has some great share tools, too. Grilling and barbecue is our favorite past time, and not just because of the food - outdoor cooking brings family and friends together more than any other activity; it enriches our souls as well as our stomachs, and we want to help bring that pleasure to everyone in the world. Photos and Graphics by Jest Cafe",45.0,5,"1 Campaign

<p>A float session involves going into your own private space.  You begin by taking a shower to wash off any excess products.  Ear plugs are a wonderful tool to help keep water out of your ears yet are not required.  Upon opening the door to the float pod it will feel warm.  The water is kept close to your body temperature; about 94 degrees.  You may or may not see the bottom of the pod due to differences in each type of pod.  </p>

<p>Inside the pod, there is 10 inches of water so you can always sit up at any time. The water is combined with 1000 + lbs of epsom salts creating a dense solution which automatically allows you to float on your back.  There is no sinking, only floating.  Once lying back you begin to let go and trust that the water will keep you afloat.  After the initial 20 minutes or so, your muscles will begin to completely relax, your thoughts will diminish, and all you'll hear is your breath and your heartbeat.  </p>
<p>You can float as often as you like no matter who you are or what you look like.  Floating is for everyone, and the more you float, the better it gets.  </p>

<li> <span>Why would I want this?</span> Instead of smashing your nose against the aluminum top, you can smell the aroma of your drink. Not to mention a smooth pour and no clugging which makes you feel full. Or just Send It. </li>
<li> <span>When will this be delivered?</span> We are anticipating early 2020. </li>
<li> <span>Do you ship overseas?</span> Yes. Separate shipping rates apply.</li>
<li> <span>Can you get different colors?</span> There will be additional color options in the future. Sign up for details or contact us at <a href=""mailto:hello@drafttop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hello@drafttop.com</a> </li>
<li> <span>Are you able to put another logo on the Draft Top?</span> Yes, but not during Indiegogo. Minimum orders apply. Reach out to us at <a href=""mailto:hello@drafttop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hello@drafttop.com</a> for more details</li>
<li> <span>Does it leave a sharp edge?</span> No, the cut occurs inside the rim of the can and folds the aluminum into the rim.  </li>
<li> <span>Are the blades sharp?</span> No, in fact they are purposefully dull. We call them splitters. Technically they are splitting the metal and not cutting it.</li>
<li> <span>Will the splitters rust?</span> If left in water for a few days or covered in soda or beer there is a likelihood that they will develop surface rust. They are made from stainless steel.  </li>
<li> <span>Can it be washed/is it dishwasher safe?</span> We don't recommend using it in the dishwasher as it could affect longevity of the tool. We recommend just rinsing it using warm water after each session. </li>
<li> <span>How long will it last?</span> We've tested samples on hundreds of cans and have prototypes that are still being used well above 1,000 cans </li>
<li> <span>Does it grab the top?</span> No. If the top falls completely in, you have to flip it on its side and pull it out. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. </li>
<li> <span>So the top just falls in the can?</span> Sometimes. It all depends on how the tool is used. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. </li>
<li> <span>Isn't the top dirty?</span> Maybe but its the same top that you put your lips on when drinking from the can the normal way. So just Drink Topless! Its a lot better.  </li>

 Hell or High Water - We're Making this ProductAs you can see we have already initiated production for this product, so it’s not a question of “IF” you will be rewarded with the product but “WHEN”. We have proven to deliver on our promise in the past and fully intend to do it again.                Thank you for your support because without you we wouldn’t be here!!! Drink Topless The Draft Top team FAQ's 
 Why would I want this? Instead of smashing your nose against the aluminum top, you can smell the aroma of your drink. Not to mention a smooth pour and no clugging which makes you feel full. Or just Send It. 
 When will this be delivered? We are anticipating early 2020. 
 Do you ship overseas? Yes. Separate shipping rates apply.
 Can you get different colors? There will be additional color options in the future. Sign up for details or contact us at hello@drafttop.com 
 Are you able to put another logo on the Draft Top? Yes, but not during Indiegogo. Minimum orders apply. Reach out to us at hello@drafttop.com for more details
 Does it leave a sharp edge? No, the cut occurs inside the rim of the can and folds the aluminum into the rim.  
 Are the blades sharp? No, in fact they are purposefully dull. We call them splitters. Technically they are splitting the metal and not cutting it.
 Will the splitters rust? If left in water for a few days or covered in soda or beer there is a likelihood that they will develop surface rust. They are made from stainless steel.  
 Can it be washed/is it dishwasher safe? We don't recommend using it in the dishwasher as it could affect longevity of the tool. We recommend just rinsing it using warm water after each session. 
 How long will it last? We've tested samples on hundreds of cans and have prototypes that are still being used well above 1,000 cans 
 Does it grab the top? No. If the top falls completely in, you have to flip it on its side and pull it out. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. 
 So the top just falls in the can? Sometimes. It all depends on how the tool is used. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. 
 Isn't the top dirty? Maybe but its the same top that you put your lips on when drinking from the can the normal way. So just Drink Topless! Its a lot better.  
 Does it work on Tall boys? Yes, most 16oz to 19oz aluminum cans. It does not work on most 24oz cans or the Fosters Oil Can
 Does it work on crowlers? No - those are good for a nice set of glasses
 How does it work? When holding the tool in either hand, the top right corner has a part of the handle that sticks out. When you push this in the handle opens and retracts the splitters to the center. With the opposite hand holding the can near the top or bottom near the bends, you place the tool on the can and slowly squeeze while starting to rotate. The four splitters move outward from the center when you squeeze the handle. They puncture the inside rim of the can just below the top and split the aluminum open as you rotate the tool. A minimum of a quarter twist is needed to fully remove the top but sometimes it take a half or full twist. Below the handle are grooves designed to allow you to rest them on the rim and push the lid in. Remember, the objective is to open the top not take the lid out.

“Solight Design products have enormous advantages because they are so compact, eco-friendly, and provide a free source of light…and now electricity too...having access to lighting in a disaster zone or vulnerable community increases safety exponentially.” --Bill Horan, former president of Operation Blessing International


By using the limitless power of the sun, The QWNN offers clean, sustainable energy and can change the way we light and power our world.

There is a profound link between our health, our climate, and extreme poverty. 
Fossil fuels, used for energy and lighting globally create 65% of the pollution in the air. Even a low energy light bulb causes 22 lbs of carbon emissions per year causing 13.75  billion tons of carbon emissions for US households alone! 75% of air pollution in urban areas is due to energy consumption from buildings. 
If everyone in the United States used solar lights for a few hours a day in place of regular light bulbs, we could save up to 11 BILLION tons of CO2 emissions per year!
You CAN make a difference! Say YES to clean energy and light for our lives and our homes. 

We started this company to help people and to make lives better. Solight Design has a social mission to bring light to underserved regions around the world. The SolarPuff was created in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and we have since expanded to a whole line of solar lanterns.
 












Last fall, our CEO and inventor Alice Chun was recognized by Mayor Yulin Cruz of San Juan and President Clinton, for our work helping Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.





This ain’t our first rodeo. Before launching this Indiegogo campaign, we did a Kickstarter for our first invention, the SOLARPUFF, and we successfully delivered all 15,000+ units to our backers! 
There may be challenges along the way, but we promise to keep you well-informed and pledge to do everything in our power to ensure our backers are satisfied.

<p>Santa's Land USA is a small, themed Christmas attraction located in Putney, Vermont. The park opened in 1957 and had closed nearly four years ago.

<p>Many small family parks such as Santa's Land have disappeared off the landscape.  Once they are gone, they are gone for good and just become a memory of the past.  Santa's Land in Putney  had a wonderful new start in November and December.  We need to continue to maintain and add to the Santa's Land experience and could use your help!</p>
<p>The cost of doing business: electricity, heating, permits, employees, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, infrastructure repairs and beautification cannot be sustained on admission alone.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: The Digital Nomad 35 enables you to <strong>carry your life on your back</strong>.

Wherever you travel, you will not lose time or nerves by waiting for your luggage at the baggage carousel.

<p>Situated close to the Austrian alps, our ideal business backpack for travellers also had to be <strong>mountain-proof</strong>.

<p>Let's be honest, by now you know that you want the Digital Nomad 35 - simply because it is THE ultimate business backpack. However, there is one decision for you to make: Do you want it in <strong>black or grey</strong>? The black version is made of Cordura - a high-quality fabric known for its durability and resistance to tears, scuffs and abrasions. The grey version consists of Vecoya (for vegan + ecological yarn) - in this case, the polymer gets dyed in the very beginning. Compared to common fabrication processes, this leads to a reduction in water consumption (-90%), CO2 emission (-60%) and energy usage (-60%). Because what's the use in location independence, if there's no location worth travelling to?</p>

Our mess kits were inspired by Japanese minimalism. We wanted you to be able to pack light while still packing the necessities. Our mess kit is compact and portable, making sure everything fits inside itself just like origami. The ultimate goal of our mess kit design is comprised of three parts: simple, efficient, and economic.In Japanese culture, outdoor-cooking is often seen as a relaxing experience that helps with spiritual liberation. With the help of Japanese outdoor enthusiast Jun Kichibee, in just 2 years we were finally able to accomplish a set of minimal mess kits for now and the future.   The Hex Non-stick Frying Pan is made of hard-anodized aluminum and coated with a non-stick layer.Because of its width and depth, its cooking possibilities are limitless.*When cooking, pans are better than pots because their structure releases internal pressure, which eliminates excessive spilling from the pan. 

 
 The detachable and extendable spork is made from nylon 6-6, which prevents the non-stick layer of the frying pan from scratching and withstands high temperatures, and platinum-grade silicone rubber.Its ergonomic design with robust strength offers three levels of adjustment, so it’s useful in many scenarios. You have the ability to cook with it, as well as eat or serve with it.   Since ancient times, the Japanese have used Japanese Cypress to build temples and other landmarks that have lasted thousands of years, which is exactly what we use for our durable wooden spatula. The Japanese Cypress spatula has the highest density and rigidity, yet it’s super lightweight. Use it to cut and serve your food. It can also be used as a mini cutting board for chopping different ingredients like herbs, fruits, vegetables, etc.We are co-operating with an experienced wood utensil maker in Kyoto, Japan in order to bring the traditional Japanese wood craftsmanship to outdoor gear design.

The stove is easy to assemble and is made out of 4 parts. The largest part is the base of the stove with the half grill and the hole in the side. In this side hole fits the side tube. The side tube gets fixed in place with the slide and on top of the base fits the pot-stand. The slide fits in to a slot of the half circle ass-plate in the base of the stove and connects to the top of the side tube.    Works efficiently   The stove has a natural working. This means there is no need of batteries or fans to make the fire burn well.  Because of the insulation in the wall more hot air goes out the top of the stove. This makes that more air flows into the stove. The airflow which is generated flows under the burning wood so it has more oxygen and burns better.     Easy to fuel and refuel As fuel for the stove you use sticks, twigs and other biofuel you find in nature. The fueling and refueling is very easy even when cooking. Because of the 45° angle the stove works self-feeding. Thanks to the space between the pouring mouth of the pot and the lid on the pot it is easy to drain the cooking water .   Specifications of the setMaterial 304 stainless steel Weight 1kg ( 2,2 pound ) Dimensions (Assembled) Height 16 cm ( 6,3 inch ) Width 12 cm ( 4,7 inch )     ""The Kombuis""Kombuis is a Dutch word for the kitchen on a ship. In dutch ""kom"" and ""buis"" also are two separate words. That translate to bowl and tube. So it's a kichen that consists of ""a bowl"" the pot and ""a tube"" the stove.    By Arnaud Started in 2017 by Arnaud Desseyn.

Let’s face it, the standard outdoor recreational chair has been a poorly built product for decades; easily broken, fabrics that tear, and are generally uncomfortable to sit in. To eliminate these problems, we sourced the highest quality materials we could find to build a product that stands up to the demands of the outdoors.         Voyager was built to be functional & comfortable. We took a long hard look at what people wanted from their outdoor chairs and it came down to 4 key performance components. 1) Ergonomically designed comfort: Sit where you're supposed to sit. Not too high, not too low. The Voyager sits in what we call the Goldie-Locks Zone. Just right.   2) Hands-Free Carry / Double Pack: Hands-free-carry satchel/pack strap that gives your hands the freedom to carry whatever the day demands & Double Pack (fold and carry) that secures those extra items needed at your destination.    3) Interchangeable Cup Holder: Cupholder fixtures built into either side of the framing (left/right) with cutouts designed for cans, insulated water bottles, and coffee mugs.    4) Multiple Products in One: A detachable cooler is conveniently located under your seat for easy access to your favorite items and contains 4 exterior zipper pockets that store and protect your most valuable belongings.    Voyager Design StagesThe final design of the Voyager chair came across our desk by complete surprise.

<h2><strong>How it works? </strong></h2>
<p>Charcoal briquettes ignite at 660 degrees Fahrenheit. The Quick Start Grill heating element reaches its highest temperature (around 950 degrees Fahrenheit) in 3- 4 minutes. This allows the charcoal to ignite faster, and the predetermined configuration of the element starts the charcoal uniformly.  </p>

<p>What kind of wood do you like to use to do your BBQing? All you have to do is spread Hickory, Maple, Mesquite, or whatever wood chips on top of the coals. You can have smoked apple, alder, or cherry smoked BBQ ribs in matter of minutes. After spreading the wet wood chips on top of the hot coals, wait a little until the heavy smoke turns to light bluish smoke, and put your ribs on the grill. Put the lid on with the two top vents open, and Wa-lah! Great Mesquite Smoked Ribs!</p>

<h3>Note about Sizing and Exchanging:</h3>
<p>We've created a sizing chart for you to follow which we hope you can double check which size is right for you at the time of ordering. </p>
<p>With regards to exchanges, if after using the size chart you do feel the size is still not right for you, then we can arrange an exchange however we will require the customer to pay for the 2-way postage for us to receive it back from you and exchange the item/s for a different size and send the replacement back out to you. We will require the item/s to be in the new condition you received it. The exchange period is 30 days from which you have received your items.</p>
<p>As part of this Indiegogo campaign and offering you this great deal we hope you understand these terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need your help get this product to life. When launching a product (and brand) there are HUGE outlays such as marketing, development, production and inventory. As well as continuing to put food on the table!</li>
<li>We're offering a discount price on the Flite Jacket before it goes beyond ""backer"" stage and into the hands on retailers and distributors. And a chance to join the first to enjoy this amazing jacket, which we know will change your travelling experience forever! As part of this exciting launch, we are adding an RFID slimline passport wallet for free with every Flite Jacket sold.</li>
<li>We are grateful for any backing and contributions we get. The money raised will still be put into getting the first production run ready and completed, so we can then put products into the hands of our early supporters.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>As regular travellers we understand that finding every little trick and chance to improve the comfort level of any form of travelling is at the top of our minds, from when we're stepping out of the car at the airport and checking in, or right back when booking the trip online. We ponder, ""<i>Can the flight be upgraded</i>? <i>Do I have lounge access? How much extra for an exit row seat?""</i>  That sudden urge hits to do whatever you can do to be more comfortable. We know that you can now rest assured that your Flite Jacket will keep you extremely comfortable no matter how you are travelling or where you are sitting, and is practical to assist with carrying all those essential items when travelling. </li>
<li>The Thin Air Brand and Flite Jacket item were created by people who have been in the ""Travel goods"" space and category for close to 15 years. From sourcing and manufacturing through to supplying and building brands and ranges for international retailers. The team understand the needs for practical and minimalistic items for travelling and exploring. The word “Thin Air” is being used to reflect a range of products that are light, practical and comfortable when travelling. The Thin Air brand is going to be continually launching innovative items in the travel category, with its second product launch planned in mid-2020</li>
<li>Any Retail or Distributor enquiries can be sent to info@thinairglobal.com</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're confident the design, the features, and the quality in manufacturing will be under control. Plus will have members of our team on the ground at the factory to handle Pre and Post production checking. But we also understand that with production on any type of clothing item that strange things can happen with the material or stitching etc after some first time use, which creates disappointment for the customer. We're going to do everything we can to guarantee the highest quality production procedures are in place for this item and minimise potential issues to the best of our ability. If anything strange does occur with your product there will be a support contact to get in touch with for our team to handle it asap. Support Contact: support@thinairglobal.com We understand customer service is REALLY important here on this platform (or any online platform for that matter) and will work hard to keep this at a high standard.</p>
<p>With creating a brand comes the challenge to raise the capital in order to manage production, distribution, marketing and product development. We appreciate the backing of this product and in return promise to build a brand that keeps people like you who love to travel at the forefront of everything we do.</p>

With regards to exchanges, if after using the size chart you do feel the size is still not right for you, then we can arrange an exchange however we will require the customer to pay for the 2-way postage for us to receive it back from you and exchange the item/s for a different size and send the replacement back out to you. We will require the item/s to be in the new condition you received it. The exchange period is 30 days from which you have received your items.
As part of this Indiegogo campaign and offering you this great deal we hope you understand these terms and conditions.
What We Need & What You Get

We need your help get this product to life. When launching a product (and brand) there are HUGE outlays such as marketing, development, production and inventory. As well as continuing to put food on the table!
We're offering a discount price on the Flite Jacket before it goes beyond ""backer"" stage and into the hands on retailers and distributors. And a chance to join the first to enjoy this amazing jacket, which we know will change your travelling experience forever! As part of this exciting launch, we are adding an RFID slimline passport wallet for free with every Flite Jacket sold.
We are grateful for any backing and contributions we get. The money raised will still be put into getting the first production run ready and completed, so we can then put products into the hands of our early supporters.


The Impact

As regular travellers we understand that finding every little trick and chance to improve the comfort level of any form of travelling is at the top of our minds, from when we're stepping out of the car at the airport and checking in, or right back when booking the trip online. We ponder, ""Can the flight be upgraded? Do I have lounge access? How much extra for an exit row seat?""  That sudden urge hits to do whatever you can do to be more comfortable. We know that you can now rest assured that your Flite Jacket will keep you extremely comfortable no matter how you are travelling or where you are sitting, and is practical to assist with carrying all those essential items when travelling. 
The Thin Air Brand and Flite Jacket item were created by people who have been in the ""Travel goods"" space and category for close to 15 years. From sourcing and manufacturing through to supplying and building brands and ranges for international retailers. The team understand the needs for practical and minimalistic items for travelling and exploring. The word “Thin Air” is being used to reflect a range of products that are light, practical and comfortable when travelling. The Thin Air brand is going to be continually launching innovative items in the travel category, with its second product launch planned in mid-2020
Any Retail or Distributor enquiries can be sent to info@thinairglobal.com


Risks & Challenges
We're confident the design, the features, and the quality in manufacturing will be under control. Plus will have members of our team on the ground at the factory to handle Pre and Post production checking. But we also understand that with production on any type of clothing item that strange things can happen with the material or stitching etc after some first time use, which creates disappointment for the customer. We're going to do everything we can to guarantee the highest quality production procedures are in place for this item and minimise potential issues to the best of our ability. If anything strange does occur with your product there will be a support contact to get in touch with for our team to handle it asap. Support Contact: support@thinairglobal.com We understand customer service is REALLY important here on this platform (or any online platform for that matter) and will work hard to keep this at a high standard.
With creating a brand comes the challenge to raise the capital in order to manage production, distribution, marketing and product development. We appreciate the backing of this product and in return promise to build a brand that keeps people like you who love to travel at the forefront of everything we do.

<p>Ping Pong in the Park Baltimore is a

	advocating to install a PERMANENT Ping Pong table in Wyman Park Dell.
	We want to create a community bond through interaction around the
	love of the sport of Ping Pong. A bond that unites players,
	passersby, and even donors for future tables so there will be even
	more access to play. Please help us reach our goal with a donation and pass this campaign along to your fellow Ping Pong enthusiast, family and friends. Get pumped and your game face on! :D<br/></p>

<h3></h3>We aim to boost the sport and neighboring
community by   		      providing public tables in a safe environment
for everyone to enjoy at any time. Several
companies manufacture permanent outdoor tables that can weather
the elements 	      and stand the test of time for generations to
enjoy. These tables become permanent fixtures 		      wherever they
are installed and have proven to be highly effective in promoting
fitness and 	  	      social interaction as well as introducing art
and beauty into the American common space. 		     The Wyman Park Dell
table will be the first of its kind across Baltimore City and will
show 	  	     the willingness and enthusiasm of a community that can
bring positive change and fun 	   	     activity to its residents and
visitors of all age groups and ethnicity's.

<p>Ping Pong in the Park has gained the

<p>Our aim is to work together and provide our local communities the opportunity to find wellness for themselves through different avenues of experiences that they feel drawn to.</p>
<h3><strong>Building our Earth Lodge.</strong></h3>
<h3>Our first collective project is to raise funds to build an <strong>Earth Lodge</strong>, which provides the opportunity for people to experience purification and cleansing of mind, body and spirit. <em>We are asking for your help to raise the funds for the raw materials needed for this structure to be built.</em> <br/>We are requiring funding help for the</h3>

<li>Earth</li>
<li>Clay</li>
<li>Sand</li>
<li>Wood</li>
<li>Grass and wild flower seeds</li>
</ol>
<h3>The <strong>Earth Lodge</strong> is an experience that is thousands of years old and used by many cultures to purify and detoxify impurities in the human body. It's like a sauna experience without the electrical mod cons. All the Elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water are called upon to create the experience.</h3>
<h3><strong><em>We are also offering you something in return by donating in the £50 and £60 perks from our members.</em></strong></h3>
<p>The Healing experiences are all 'gifted' by the practioners to this <strong>Earth Lodge</strong> project:</p>

<li>Solution Focus Brief Therapy - Claudia van Zuiden</li>
<li>Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) and Matrix re-imprinting - Richard Kent</li>
<li>Sports massage - Joey Devlin</li>
<li>Shamanic vibrational and centre balancing - Jason Schroeder</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't want to use it for yourself we can send you a gift voucher for someone you would like to gift it to. Our practitioners are in Aberdeenshire except Joey who is in Aberdeen. Once you have chosen one of these 'perks' the practioner will be in touch with you to make an appointment at a suitably convenient time for you both or arrange a gift voucher.</p>
<p>The £60 perk of participating in an Earth Lodge Ceremony will be available several times through the year, weather dependent.</p>
<h3>Once the Earth Lodge is built we will have an open day that you are invited to, to see what you have supported in creating. Our goal is that it will be created by August 2013, if not sooner.</h3>

Quiet, lightweight and environmentally friendly.The best water fun you will ever have. You’ve never experienced anything like this. It is a full package replacing your scooter and fins. Amphi uses the swimmer’s own finning style to intelligently add power in very precise ways.All while preserving your precious oxygen to swim further, longer and deeper.

Perfect for swimmers, snorkelers, free-divers and water sport enthusiasts
Imagine yourself in blue seas, with coral, turtles, dolphins, colorful fish. Would you like to be able to stay there longer and with less effort? NOW YOU CAN! Amphi is a powered bionic monofin with a built-in thruster. No controls, hands-free, fast or slow, deep or shallow - are you in?
Hands-free swimming, snorkeling or divingEnjoy the underwater world with your hands being able to do things: take selfies, check them as you go, collect and admire treasures you just picked, or just play with fish!Hybrid propulsion saves you precious oxygenAmphi offers a hybrid propulsion: you decide to use either your muscles or the thruster, or both. This allows you to stay longer underwater or go a longer distance.


High maneuverability in shallow and deep water

No other scooter in the world lets you swim on your back. Imagine simply resting while being propelled by Amphi. Otter maneuver - swimming on your back! Swimming on your belly and your side! Sea horse maneuver - swimming in a kneeling position.
 
No other scooter in the world is able to give you this many options!

Complete freedom in the water 
Effortless zipping, turns...you feel like you belong there together with other creatures.

Feels like natural swimming with less effortAmphi is not perceived by a swimmer as an additional piece of equipment, but rather as an enhancement to his/her natural abilities. How does Amphi work?You attach your feet to the Amphi and swim. It’s that simple! Amphi will sense the strength of your kick and will add or subtract power accordingly. It works a little like an electric bicycle, adding power in response to input from the swimmer. Add a little power or a lot. The result is an increased range, reduced oxygen consumption, and a whole new dimension to your water activities. We call it “hybrid propulsion,” but you’ll just think it’s fun. Amphi can add just an extra boost, or provide all of your propulsion. Imagine simply resting while effortlessly being propelled by Amphi. You can change the character of this control mechanism in two ways: by changing sensitivity to your kicks, or by changing for how long the thruster will remain “on” after you stop kicking. This allows you to go between aggressive sport like machines and relaxed cruising pal.SPD cleatsWe use the SPD cycling cleats instead of traditional foot pockets. The cleats achieve three things:
Allow you to use your favorite cycling shoes* – high comfort
Allow for a little bit of play at the ankle – very important for longer swims
You can release your feet at any moment by twisting your foot by roughly 10 degrees - important safety feature
*please note that cycling shoes and cleats are not included and must be purchased separately Amphi can be also used as a towing deviceAmphi can be disassembled in seconds. Its power pack could be used for fun, or as a towing device, bringing you to safety. Can be checked in at airportsSmallest and lightest for a given level of thrust.

We are working together with like-minded volunteers from all over the world who come to share and co-create this rustic and unique mosaic that is Mano a Mano.We are passionate about permaculture and bio-construction. Considering the current state of the environment and the planet, we strongly believe that this is the path to take for a brighter future. And who knows, maybe we can spread the eco-friendly vibe and others can learn from this way of creating and respecting Mother Nature.Working with local communityWe want to create a space where everyone is welcome.

<h3>What is Craft Beer Journeys?</h3>
<p>My name is Irwin Shires. Welcome to Craft Beer Journeys!</p>
<ul>
<li>The mission of Craft Beer Journeys (CBJ) is to help beer enthusiasts develop life-enhancing, meaningful bonding experiences. Small group tours of 10-30 people will enjoy VIP treatment and ""private entrance"" access to the world's great beer-making locations. These include:<ul>
<li>The beer meccas of western Europe: Great Britain, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, and the Czech Republic</li>
<li>Exotic and emerging locales: Australia, New Zealand, South Africa</li>
<li>The burgeoning beer-centric regions of the USA and Canada</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developing this concept has been a true labor of love. As a 29 year veteran of the trucking industry, specializing in Government Compliance and Logistics, I have worked tirelessly at perfecting the concepts of building business relationships, understanding the legal requirements and regulations involved with international travel, and the development of specialized and detailed travel itineraries.</li>
<li>My love of great tasting beer has been around for nearly 35 years, since I first enjoyed a pint of Brown Ale in a pub near Birmingham, England, with my British-born father.</li>

</div></div>","What is Craft Beer Journeys?
My name is Irwin Shires. Welcome to Craft Beer Journeys!

The mission of Craft Beer Journeys (CBJ) is to help beer enthusiasts develop life-enhancing, meaningful bonding experiences. Small group tours of 10-30 people will enjoy VIP treatment and ""private entrance"" access to the world's great beer-making locations. These include:
The beer meccas of western Europe: Great Britain, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, and the Czech Republic
Exotic and emerging locales: Australia, New Zealand, South Africa
The burgeoning beer-centric regions of the USA and Canada


Developing this concept has been a true labor of love. As a 29 year veteran of the trucking industry, specializing in Government Compliance and Logistics, I have worked tirelessly at perfecting the concepts of building business relationships, understanding the legal requirements and regulations involved with international travel, and the development of specialized and detailed travel itineraries.
My love of great tasting beer has been around for nearly 35 years, since I first enjoyed a pint of Brown Ale in a pub near Birmingham, England, with my British-born father.
My Dad (also named Irwin) and I took a ""bucket list"" trip to England in 2007. It was a memorable week of touring historic old breweries, and even older country pubs! The trip left such an indelible impression on me, that on the flight home, I made the casual remark, ""I can't believe no one has thought of marketing trips like this?""

You wanted a tent that could do everything.. ..You wanted to be well-rested. To be warm in winter, cool in summer. You wanted space. Space to stand up and no longer feel cramped and awful.And you wanted weather protection. How do you get both?- It EXTENDS VERTICALLY.    In a matter of seconds, you can pop-up the XTENT to an extremely roomy, standing tent.We'd like to see another 2-3 person tent do that.Why a Standing Tent?No longer will you be hunched over all day if there's an unexpected downpour.Today is the day you can put on your pants like a regular person.But when the weather gets rough, lower the tent and have a secured night sleep.    *PING* And you're ready to put on your pants like a regular person.   We spent the last two years developing the XTENT. We worked tirelessly to create an easy-to-use, all-round tent.The only strings attached are our awesome guy ropes.Quick and Easy Setup With two main poles connected together, you'll have the XTENT up and ready in no time.Packed with Features.It's your perfect-for-any-situation tent.Yeah. You've found the only all-rounder.Perfect for Any Situation.They simply don't. You can have a big, roomy tent that fits on your backpack. Our new-and-improved Crua Cocoon V2 dampens sound, blocks out light AND is temperature-controlled.The result? You'll sleep in the wilderness just like you would in a cosy bed at home. Bliss. The Crua Cocoon V2 is used as an inner tent. Simply place inside your XTENT and inflate the two air beams. It takes less than 2 minutes to set up.(And about as much effort as opening 2 bananas).Quick-and-Easy Air Frame Technology. The XTENT is perfect for:
 Hiking adventures
 Bike packing
 Kayak Touring
Festivals
A day at the beach  
 Car camping trips
The backyard to keep bugs at bay
​ 
Always check local laws regarding the collection of rainwater. We would never endorse the collection of rainwater where it is not legal. 
Rainwater Collection should be used primarily for tasks like washing clothes or hiking boots.
Please ensure your flysheet is clean and free from debris before using.
Rainwater Collection must be used along with a secondary filtration device. 
One XTENT is great. But the real magic is when two come together.Join forces with your camping buddies and connect the porches for an ultimate outdoors experience. 

 Wet gear is awful. So to soothe your worries, get a Crua Storage Hammock with any full kit. It attaches to each corner of the tent, with the height at your discretion. Inside Dry Storage:  There are also tonnes of handy pockets inside. Perfect for your phones, wallets, secret diaries. Whatever. Transforming Pocket Awesomeness.  Here's a bit we love. When the XTENT is lowered, the excess material forms another storage area. We've used this for wet gear before- but only if you're using our Cocoon Inner Tent.  PREMIUM Grade Materials.   We use only the highest grade materials on Crua products. Polyester 185T, Oxford Polyester 150D (both HH 5,000) and aluminum (or aluminium in Ireland!) poles. Tested, Tested, Tested.We spent a lot of time testing out the XTENT on the rugged, unforgiving west coast of Ireland.  Setup VideoIt's a breeze!
 

 
 Thank You!We are overwhelmed by the early support for the XTENT. Here at Crua, we take immense pride in being built from the crowd. Right from the very beginning, you've helped us with design and development. Now, you're bringing the project to life. 

Who are we? At Crua, we're a team of outdoor enthusiasts and adventure lovers. With one office in Co.

<p>If you have
not yet heard, World-Wide Holdings Corporation who owns our building, and whose
worth multi- billions of dollars -- has made a very upsetting last minute
decision and has informed us that they are forcing the closure of our beloved
establishment. One week ago we were told that The Subway Inn, which has been a
part of the midtown neighborhood for more than 77 years is being FORCED TO
CLOSE BY AUGUST 20th so that high-end luxury condos can be built on our
spot.</p>

that New York City is about more than rich investors gobbling up small family
businesses to make a quick buck thereby destroying the integrity of the Upper
East Side of Manhattan. For more than 40 years-- the ENTIRE Salinas family has
poured its heart and soul into this neighborhood landmark. For example, below
is a list of the family members who have work at Subway Inn and whose life will

If you have
not yet heard, World-Wide Holdings Corporation who owns our building, and whose
worth multi- billions of dollars -- has made a very upsetting last minute
decision and has informed us that they are forcing the closure of our beloved
establishment. One week ago we were told that The Subway Inn, which has been a
part of the midtown neighborhood for more than 77 years is being FORCED TO
CLOSE BY AUGUST 20th so that high-end luxury condos can be built on our
spot.

that New York City is about more than rich investors gobbling up small family
businesses to make a quick buck thereby destroying the integrity of the Upper
East Side of Manhattan. For more than 40 years-- the ENTIRE Salinas family has
poured its heart and soul into this neighborhood landmark. For example, below

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>Hello dear contributors! How are you? Do you like nature and photography, if the answer is yes you will love this campaign. My name is Aleksandar I am 19 year old physics student from Serbia, precisely one small town at the north, Kikinda. Vojvodina was the cultural crossroad for centuries and today borders Hungary,Croatia and Romania. One of the greatest music festivals in this part of the Europe is taking place in Vojvodina (city of Novi Sad) - Exit! Currently there are six official languages and more then 26 ethnic groups. Vojvodina also has the beautiful nature, absolutely amazing nature endemic species (they only live in Vojvodina). There are many rivers (such as Danube) and irrigation canals with beautiful landscape. I would like to ride across this amazing land and share its beauties with you. My plan is to travel about 600km (~380 miles) in ten days and visit major cities on my way. This is a map of my tour:<img alt=""Map of my trip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/890481/pictures/original/20130624151711-map.png?1372112230"" src="""" style="""" title=""Map""/><br/>Google map link (<a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/8RQtd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/8RQtd</a>).</p>

<p>I already have camera, but my main problem is means of transportation (bicycle). I had  an amazing bike for years but it broke down(:'( ) after years of loyal service.  First I would need to buy new bike (I would look for some used, because new bikes are very expensive), a tent to sleep in and I would need money for food and other supplies during my trip. </p>

We came across many such people in the villages who had no clue about government programs. And that is such a shame. Because there are so many programs out there for the poor,  which can literally have life-changing effect. </p><h3> </h3><h3>The Corruption Problem.</h3><h3>Another very real reason why programs don't reach those on the ground is heavy leakages/corruption.</h3><p>The corruption problem is real and all pervasive. As you saw in the video, the common villagers have a very low opinions of the village pradhan or ""head."" They blame the officials/higher ups for programs not getting to them. And to a large extent its true. </p><p> </p><h3>The Red-Tape Problem. </h3><h3>Every single Indian is aware of the unbelievable amount of red-tape that plagues the country. </h3><p>The red-tape problem is undeniable and all pervasive. The application process is usually gruelling, convoluted and ineffectively drawn out. Unlike the western world, nothing is straight forward and simple. <strong>A good amount of running around is almost always a given</strong>. The red-tape problems are compounded for the poor (usually the target of government programs and the ones who need to be enrolled in such programs the most).</p><p>So, the  hurdle for them is psychological. From engaging and talking to several poor/in-need individuals, we have found that they are <strong>scared off from even the thought applying,</strong> just by the anticipation of paperwork/running around involved. For them compared to a “normal middle-class” person the application process seems even more daunting and herculean a task.  </p><p> </p><h2><u>We be good people on a MISSION!</u></h2><h3>We are not complete novices when it comes to rural service. Anshul Gupta and his team (as Raghuvar Dayal Seva Sansthan),<u> have a track record of working with and helping villagers.</u>
</h3><p>He has run workshops and primary education camps for village kids, and implemented other ingenious ideas. Like one where the team successfully convinced many local service-based shop owners (like tailors, beauty salon owners) to train the local village women free of charge. This way the women got a chance to run home-based-businesses and have their own independent source of income sans husband. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292249/aku7yt1pwiscnypauj5g.png"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292492/yzs3q0y1kbkcmpsvxf9o.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292509/erwtjjjxnhaaaxfz6p3y.png"" src="""" style=""""/>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292534/kkvibxbion8rylmykffv.png"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p><p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292563/pddr5rs2xtfa4i101wze.png"" src="""" style=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292577/jghbgawiyrclcg3eerlh.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292601/gkrev1z9fzoit4pnpzmw.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292624/xdphwz0eaeyg5txugsjp.png"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292635/omjvkry8zzci9paitemx.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292659/maokxrfcdtyaxkkq5o0x.png"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292687/mnrlhuvq1po35ll5l6oa.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292718/mkidkz4ikrjxtjcanotj.png"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292736/byjkp2xmz3mzp7w6wpor.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292758/hg8uwvzyfeoncqouu9wf.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292784/a5vlrgtk36ndrf4xjbe6.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292807/g5mmj1omendljywoqbym.png"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476292823/mqqe861c2ctw4h6w0fat.png"" src="""" style=""""/>                                       </p><p> </p><h3>During this on-the-ground time, <strong>is when we started to notice how most villagers weren't enrolled in government schemes</strong>. After noticing such a <strong>HUGE NEED</strong> on the ground level we decided to do something about it.</h3><p><i>And that is how our campaign idea germinated -- &amp; Lift Up India came about. </i></p><p>Our India team leader and guiding light, is Anshul Gupta. He is an honest and decent guy. A visionary, with compelling depth of character and conviction. Most of all, he is one of those.</p><h3>The type that carry within them the “keeda,” the inextinguishable flaming desire to “do something” and make our world a little better for those a little worse off. One of those, who are not just intellectually aware of Hinduism’s basic tenet of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family), but feel it as a universal truth in their bones. Recognising that “out there” someone from our family is suffering right now, and there but for the grace of God go I. </h3><p>Someone who operates on such a level of awareness, makes it their life’s urgent purpose to help “others.” The “how” then, becomes almost inconsequential. As sooner or later, because of being driven by such pure purpose, they always find the most effective how. </p><p>And with this amazing idea (not just hyperbole, if executed as planned it carries real potential to change lives) in part being Anshul’s brainchild, he has found his how. To reiterate the mission -- connecting the poor with government programs.</p><p>Most of the past efforts have been on an ad-hoc, logistically unorganised, small-scale basis. Because of the missing factor, that are must-haves to build and run any serious/successful organization worth its salt -- monies to run operation. </p><p> </p><h3>So have to say this --</h3><h3>That if you take a chance on us, our word is this —we are honest in our conduct, sincere in our effort, and very very passionate for the cause!!!</h3><p>Hence your very own campaign here! Please donate keeping the cynicism aside! Help us raise funds! And we promise (yes, with the ironical self-awareness of a stranger’s promise) to be as honest, judicious, and prudent with the donated funds, as we would with money out of our own pocket. Maybe even more so, because the level of responsibility felt here is so much more.</p><p>Someone didn’t just donate funds here. They took a chance, placed their faith in us, and we can’t let them down! </p><p><u><strong>Please know, that we will do it well and do it right. </strong></u></p><p> </p><h2><u>More on ...the Government Programs.</u></h2><p>There are umpteen number of Government of India sponsored programs which can really turn things around for so many, if only they manage to extensively reach those in true need. </p><p>A few such relevant sampling of programs, with immediate and direct impact are:</p><p><strong>Mudra Yojna —</strong> Government sponsored micro-lending program, to help start/expand small businesses with no money down.</p><p><strong>PM Kaushal Vikas Yojna —</strong> Government run free training and certification program. Industry-relevant apprenticeship for unemployed youths. Trainees upon completion, receive certificate and also a training reward amount. Helps with final job hunt and placement process too.</p><p><strong>Stand Up India — </strong>Facilitates development and creates opportunities for historically disenfranchised groups (comparable to the affirmative action programs for African Americans here in US). Under this program, every bank in India has to mandatorily make out loans between Rs. 10 lakhs - Rs. 1 Crore, to a minimum of two persons, to start a new business. One woman, and one SC or ST (Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe Individual).</p><p><strong>PM Ujjwala Yojna —</strong> (falls under the Smaller-Impact-But-Still Vital Program) Upon enrollment government provides free LPG cooking gas connection. Gives them access to clean(er) cooking fuel and empowers the women in poor households, without denting their household budgets.  Traditional fuel source (fossil fuels, wood barks, dried cow-dung) are a direct health hazard, causing pain and health issues for rural women. </p><p> </p><p>Along with these, there are several other non-job or non-loan programs, which can also play a huge role in helping out targeted stratas of society.</p><p>An example would be the <strong>Krishi Vikas Yojna</strong> (Farmer’s Growth Program) — created specifically for farmers to encourage bio-farming; but enrollment process requires group of 50 farmers to file together, successful enrollment results in every farmer in the group being given Rs. 20,000 per acre for 3 years.</p><p>Another example would be, the <strong>Fasal Beema Yojna </strong>(started 2016) —it provides crop insurance to farmers at a very very low premium (in most instances 1.5-3.5%). Given the back to back draughts (leading to inflation in farmer suicides) which have plagued India for the past 2 years, it is pertinent that every farmer in the country is made-aware of and enrolled in such life-saving and other beneficial programs. </p><p><strong>The point is the list above just scratches the surface. </strong><i>Programs after programs after programs exist to uplift historically disadvantaged groups, and those living in penury. </i> But these programs need to widely reach such people on the ground, like yesterday!</p><p> </p><h2><u>Other Problems.</u></h2><h2><u>(Which don't let the programs reach the poor)</u></h2><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Education and “Class” Problem.</strong></h3><p>The poor often lack in both — education and a certain amount of required sophistication.</p><p>How being illiterate can make the application process automatically harder is quite understandable. But the sophistication part is nuanced, and might need more of an explanation to get. </p><p>It’s hard to admit and digest, but the fact is Indians are often quite superficially judgmental. A poor person, at the bottom of the ladder, when he walks in and tries to get his work done, is usually not “entertained” as quickly (relatively speaking). Often thats because it is “understood” that they have no-recourse or “standing” to create a scene or adverse issues for the officer-in-charge. To get any work done, they just have to be extra patient, jump through extra hoops, and grin and bear the treatment meted out. </p><h3><strong>The Bribery Problem.</strong></h3><h3>Another shameful but real factor is bribes! Yes, bribes are often expected and paid to “get work done.”</h3><p>Sometimes paid to speed up the process, sometimes to even get the application “considered.” Being born an Indian, to write this in a public platform is painful. But in this case, the bribe culture, is a hard but important factor to mention. Because a “normal middle class person” might have the resources to give in to a overt or covert “request” for bribe. But a poor man does not have that option! </p><p>The officer-in-charge senses this “inability to pay” about the poor person (usually identified by the way they speak and dress) the moment they step into the office. And hence right of the bat, the fellow is placed on  low priority and given a harder time. Or in some cases, the poor gets taken advantage of in creative and insidious ways.</p><p>For instance, let’s take the Mudra Yojna. The government launched this scheme to boost job creation and spur economic growth. Under it, very small businesses (often including small vegetable shop vendors, aspiring rickshaw owners etc.) are encouraged and given micro loans ranging anywhere from Rs. 50,000 - Rs. 10 lakh (roughly $1,000 - $15,000). Now the problem is that many actual and “deserving” poor are outright denied the loans under the guise of insufficient funds or some lame cooked up paperwork excuse. Or an offer is made by the loan officer under which considerable portion of the loan given is skimmed off. And the poor usually “agrees” to the pitiful terms because the choice is either that or walk off empty handed. </p><p>Again, these are based on first-hand accounts from people who were brave enough to actually try.  They were told that they would either have to scrap together the payoff (i.e. bribe) amount and pay it upfront or “agree” to take-advantage-of-like-terms to get the application pushed through. Its a big mess. Obviously, these are observations based are individual accounts, and should not be casually extrapolated. But after talking to these people, and considering multiple similar accounts, and keeping in mind the pervasive corruption/bribe culture — it is not hard to gage that though this might not always be the case, but just often enough to be a real deterrent for the poor.</p><h2><u>We The (Core) People.</u></h2><p>Finally, here is our (core) rockstar team!</p><p><i>Driven by a burning desire to help our less fortunate brothers and sisters. </i></p><p><strong>Bipasha Bagchee</strong> -- Creative.

Use the case file to track progress & follow up (during in-person village visits and over phone) Finally. Get on ground. Help them enroll!Follow up the calls with ground visits. Help them with application process.1. Use those unique case files on individuals to keep track of their progress. 2. See which programs they are eligible for. 3. Check the application and paperwork. If missing, help them complete it (which can be a real struggle due to illiteracy)4. Visit offices with them, repeatedly if necessary,  stand side by side and help them fight the red-tape. 5. Make sure the officers realize we mean business, take whatever action necessary (following up with officers, escalating, writing letters, creating a scene, running around, applying pressure through collective action) to get them enrolled! Stand together.Fight, till they are in.Be their CHAMPION! A sampling of villages we have been active in so far:Sarai PrathamSaraiya VillageLuthpuraLakshmanpur PilakhPurwa PitaramKachhpura VillageBanthra, Shahjahanpur DistrictRuru Kala, Auraiya DistrictRuru Khurd, BidhunaKatra SadatganjBampur Uparhar Village, MejaLakhimpurBalli, MeerganjLakha, MeerganjSishgarh, Maharajganj districtDakiya Bhoor, Gajraula Baripura, Shergarh, Bareilly District Nagaria Khurd, Baheri, Bareilly District Kamalpur Village, Sakaldiha, Chandauli DistrictHasanpur Village, Meerganj, Bareilly DistrictMalakpur, Bulandshahr District Like these families we are working with in the village ofRURU GANJ, AURAIYA DISTRICT!Helping so many like them...    Donate Time...To reach the villages ALL OVER India, WE NEED PEOPLE from various regions to join us. 
We can sense the immense need for such a program ACROSS India. So friends, if you are physically present in India right now, or have friends who are, please ask them to join us.There is a BIG NEED -- government programs should reach those who need it!!!We have to take them to the ground! Countrywide. So friends, all hands on deck. We can only succeed in our vision to Lift Up India as a team effort! If you can volunteer and donate time, please do it!You KNOW the cause is legit and WORTHY. There is a DEEP NEED for this.To achieve our dream, to reach and lift up the poor in every single village of the country...we need your support, the country needs your support!!!So please, please, please JOIN US in our efforts! ""If not me, who? If not now, when?"" Being semi-beginners, a burning feeling of unworthiness, sneaks up on us whenever we contemplate the size & scale potential of what we are setting out to achieve here.To offset these feelings of smallness and inadequacy, we have to remind ourselves that most change-makers in the world start small. And through consistent and incremental effort (if the idea and people are good and the focus, hard work, motivation level is unwaveringly rock solid) the baby steps soon snowball and ultimately lead to BIG difference & changed lives!!!Emma Watson our very own Hermoine, recently gave a daring and standing-ovation-worthy speech on Feminism in front of UN world leaders. She confronted her own universal-moment-of-doubt-feeling, in an amazingly inspiring way— “in my nervousness for this speech and my moments of doubt, I’ve told myself firmly- If not me, who? If not now, when?” Words to live by! More on the WHY. What's NOT working right now.The biggest roadblocks...The 3 MAIN problems:  Ignorance about programs.Corruption. Red-Tape. The Ignorance Problem.The ignorance/low-information about government schemes is a very big problem among the rural poor.You have seen some of those clips in the video. We came across many such people in the villages who had no clue about government programs. And that is such a shame. Because there are so many programs out there for the poor,  which can literally have life-changing effect.  The Corruption Problem.Another very real reason why programs don't reach those on the ground is heavy leakages/corruption.The corruption problem is real and all pervasive. As you saw in the video, the common villagers have a very low opinions of the village pradhan or ""head."" They blame the officials/higher ups for programs not getting to them. And to a large extent its true.  The Red-Tape Problem. Every single Indian is aware of the unbelievable amount of red-tape that plagues the country. The red-tape problem is undeniable and all pervasive. The application process is usually gruelling, convoluted and ineffectively drawn out. Unlike the western world, nothing is straight forward and simple. A good amount of running around is almost always a given. The red-tape problems are compounded for the poor (usually the target of government programs and the ones who need to be enrolled in such programs the most).So, the  hurdle for them is psychological. From engaging and talking to several poor/in-need individuals, we have found that they are scared off from even the thought applying, just by the anticipation of paperwork/running around involved. For them compared to a “normal middle-class” person the application process seems even more daunting and herculean a task.   We be good people on a MISSION!We are not complete novices when it comes to rural service. Anshul Gupta and his team (as Raghuvar Dayal Seva Sansthan), have a track record of working with and helping villagers.
He has run workshops and primary education camps for village kids, and implemented other ingenious ideas. Like one where the team successfully convinced many local service-based shop owners (like tailors, beauty salon owners) to train the local village women free of charge. This way the women got a chance to run home-based-businesses and have their own independent source of income sans husband.                                                                During this on-the-ground time, is when we started to notice how most villagers weren't enrolled in government schemes. After noticing such a HUGE NEED on the ground level we decided to do something about it.And that is how our campaign idea germinated -- & Lift Up India came about. Our India team leader and guiding light, is Anshul Gupta. He is an honest and decent guy. A visionary, with compelling depth of character and conviction. Most of all, he is one of those.The type that carry within them the “keeda,” the inextinguishable flaming desire to “do something” and make our world a little better for those a little worse off. One of those, who are not just intellectually aware of Hinduism’s basic tenet of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family), but feel it as a universal truth in their bones. Recognising that “out there” someone from our family is suffering right now, and there but for the grace of God go I. Someone who operates on such a level of awareness, makes it their life’s urgent purpose to help “others.” The “how” then, becomes almost inconsequential. As sooner or later, because of being driven by such pure purpose, they always find the most effective how. And with this amazing idea (not just hyperbole, if executed as planned it carries real potential to change lives) in part being Anshul’s brainchild, he has found his how. To reiterate the mission -- connecting the poor with government programs.Most of the past efforts have been on an ad-hoc, logistically unorganised, small-scale basis. Because of the missing factor, that are must-haves to build and run any serious/successful organization worth its salt -- monies to run operation.  So have to say this --That if you take a chance on us, our word is this —we are honest in our conduct, sincere in our effort, and very very passionate for the cause!!!Hence your very own campaign here! Please donate keeping the cynicism aside! Help us raise funds! And we promise (yes, with the ironical self-awareness of a stranger’s promise) to be as honest, judicious, and prudent with the donated funds, as we would with money out of our own pocket. Maybe even more so, because the level of responsibility felt here is so much more.Someone didn’t just donate funds here. They took a chance, placed their faith in us, and we can’t let them down! Please know, that we will do it well and do it right.  More on ...the Government Programs.There are umpteen number of Government of India sponsored programs which can really turn things around for so many, if only they manage to extensively reach those in true need. A few such relevant sampling of programs, with immediate and direct impact are:Mudra Yojna — Government sponsored micro-lending program, to help start/expand small businesses with no money down.PM Kaushal Vikas Yojna — Government run free training and certification program. Industry-relevant apprenticeship for unemployed youths. Trainees upon completion, receive certificate and also a training reward amount. Helps with final job hunt and placement process too.Stand Up India — Facilitates development and creates opportunities for historically disenfranchised groups (comparable to the affirmative action programs for African Americans here in US). Under this program, every bank in India has to mandatorily make out loans between Rs. 10 lakhs - Rs. 1 Crore, to a minimum of two persons, to start a new business. One woman, and one SC or ST (Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe Individual).PM Ujjwala Yojna — (falls under the Smaller-Impact-But-Still Vital Program) Upon enrollment government provides free LPG cooking gas connection. Gives them access to clean(er) cooking fuel and empowers the women in poor households, without denting their household budgets.  Traditional fuel source (fossil fuels, wood barks, dried cow-dung) are a direct health hazard, causing pain and health issues for rural women.  Along with these, there are several other non-job or non-loan programs, which can also play a huge role in helping out targeted stratas of society.An example would be the Krishi Vikas Yojna (Farmer’s Growth Program) — created specifically for farmers to encourage bio-farming; but enrollment process requires group of 50 farmers to file together, successful enrollment results in every farmer in the group being given Rs. 20,000 per acre for 3 years.Another example would be, the Fasal Beema Yojna (started 2016) —it provides crop insurance to farmers at a very very low premium (in most instances 1.5-3.5%). Given the back to back draughts (leading to inflation in farmer suicides) which have plagued India for the past 2 years, it is pertinent that every farmer in the country is made-aware of and enrolled in such life-saving and other beneficial programs. The point is the list above just scratches the surface. Programs after programs after programs exist to uplift historically disadvantaged groups, and those living in penury.  But these programs need to widely reach such people on the ground, like yesterday! Other Problems.(Which don't let the programs reach the poor) The Education and “Class” Problem.The poor often lack in both — education and a certain amount of required sophistication.How being illiterate can make the application process automatically harder is quite understandable. But the sophistication part is nuanced, and might need more of an explanation to get. It’s hard to admit and digest, but the fact is Indians are often quite superficially judgmental. A poor person, at the bottom of the ladder, when he walks in and tries to get his work done, is usually not “entertained” as quickly (relatively speaking). Often thats because it is “understood” that they have no-recourse or “standing” to create a scene or adverse issues for the officer-in-charge. To get any work done, they just have to be extra patient, jump through extra hoops, and grin and bear the treatment meted out. The Bribery Problem.Another shameful but real factor is bribes! Yes, bribes are often expected and paid to “get work done.”Sometimes paid to speed up the process, sometimes to even get the application “considered.” Being born an Indian, to write this in a public platform is painful. But in this case, the bribe culture, is a hard but important factor to mention. Because a “normal middle class person” might have the resources to give in to a overt or covert “request” for bribe. But a poor man does not have that option! The officer-in-charge senses this “inability to pay” about the poor person (usually identified by the way they speak and dress) the moment they step into the office. And hence right of the bat, the fellow is placed on  low priority and given a harder time. Or in some cases, the poor gets taken advantage of in creative and insidious ways.For instance, let’s take the Mudra Yojna. The government launched this scheme to boost job creation and spur economic growth. Under it, very small businesses (often including small vegetable shop vendors, aspiring rickshaw owners etc.) are encouraged and given micro loans ranging anywhere from Rs. 50,000 - Rs. 10 lakh (roughly $1,000 - $15,000). Now the problem is that many actual and “deserving” poor are outright denied the loans under the guise of insufficient funds or some lame cooked up paperwork excuse. Or an offer is made by the loan officer under which considerable portion of the loan given is skimmed off. And the poor usually “agrees” to the pitiful terms because the choice is either that or walk off empty handed. Again, these are based on first-hand accounts from people who were brave enough to actually try.  They were told that they would either have to scrap together the payoff (i.e. bribe) amount and pay it upfront or “agree” to take-advantage-of-like-terms to get the application pushed through. Its a big mess. Obviously, these are observations based are individual accounts, and should not be casually extrapolated. But after talking to these people, and considering multiple similar accounts, and keeping in mind the pervasive corruption/bribe culture — it is not hard to gage that though this might not always be the case, but just often enough to be a real deterrent for the poor.We The (Core) People.Finally, here is our (core) rockstar team!Driven by a burning desire to help our less fortunate brothers and sisters. Bipasha Bagchee -- Creative.

</p><p>Neben Landschaftsaufnahmen gehören auch die Menschen in ihrer Umgebung zu meinen bevorzugten Motiven. Damit schaffen wir ein Bewusstsein für andere Kulturen ferner Länder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ein paar Bilder aus verschiedenen Ländern und Reisen habe ich beigefügt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zur Ausrüstung: Aktuell verwende ich eine Fuji X-E2 Systemkamera mit verschiedenen Objektiven. Von Fuji ist hier das sensationelle 23mm 1.4 dabei und als Allrounder das 18-55 Zoom. Für tolle Effekte nutze ich ein Walimex 12mm 2.0 Fisheye und für Porträtaufnahmen o.ä. ein manuelles Helios 44-4 2.0. Daneben kommen noch ein Canon FD Makro 50mm und ein Canon FD 100 2.8 zum Einsatz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Die X-E2 bietet eine überragende Bildqualität und ist gleichzeitig durch ihr geringes Gewicht eine tolle Reisekamera. Durch vielfältige Anschlußmöglichkeiten ist sie gut mit allen gängigen Objektiven kombinierbar.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Wir, das sind Martin und Gabi. Wir sind Ende 40 und seit mehr als 17 Jahren verheiratet. Inzwischen haben wir schon viele Flecken auf der Erde gesehen. So waren wir in Afrika, Asien, in der Karibik und den USA, nicht zu vergessen Österreich :-). Dieses Jahr haben wir bereits Myanmar besucht und waren sehr beeindruckt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deutschland haben wir natürlich auch schon erkundet und viele Bereiche Europas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wie wir mittlerweile festgestellt haben, lässt die Lust an Fernreisen nicht nach, jedoch die Bereitschaft, lange Flüge zu unternehmen. Die nächsten Jahre wollen wird daher noch nutzen die weite Welt und weiße Flecken zu bereisen, bevor die Kreise dann enger werden und wir in der Nähe bleiben…</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hawaii ist neben Australien (wo wir auch noch nicht waren) eines der meist entfernten Ziele und steht damit weit oben auf der Wunschliste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>About us…</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>We, that is Martin and Gabi. We are late 40s and married for more than 17 years. We are living near Ulm / Germany. From here, it´s a very long way to Hawaii!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we have seen a lot of spots on the earth. So we were in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S., not to mention Austria :-). This year we have already visited Myanmar and were very impressed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Germany of course we have already explored and many areas of Europe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As we have ascertained meanwhile, the desire in long-distance holidays does not decrease, however, the readiness to undertake long distance flights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next few years we therefore want to still travel the wide world and visit white spots before the circles are becoming closer and we remain close ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hawaii is (besides Australia, where we also had not been yet) one of the most distant targets, and therefore it is high on our wish list.</p><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/745607/files/20140726132338-20140115-multi-6113.jpg?1406406218"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p></div><br/><p><b>Weshalb dieser Weg?</b></p>

</p><p><b>Weil wir Schwaben sind und uns das Sparen im Blut und den Genen liegt?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Mit dieser Reise möchte ich Euch begeistern und uns einen Traum von Weite erfüllen. Mit Eurer Unterstützung können wir uns einen großen Traum und Ihr Euch durch Eure Beteiligung einen kleinen Traum erfüllen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Das Projekt soll uns nicht reich machen. Die Projektsumme ergibt sich aus den voraussichtlichen Kosten für die Reise und den Reisenebenkosten.</p>

</p><p><b><i>Sollte sich nach Abschluss der Reise ein Überschuss ergeben, haben wir uns gedacht, diesen Betrag zur Hälfte für wohltätige Zwecke einer gemeinnützigen Organisation (z.B.

Reisefotografie zählt zu meinen großen Leidenschaften und ich denke, dass sich die Bilder auch gut zeigen lassen. 

Einen kleinen Eindruck bekommt Ihr unter 

http://martinulm.wordpress.com
http://zeitreisen.zeit.de/interviews/monatsgewinner-februar-martin-mayer-stellt-sich-vor.

Neben Landschaftsaufnahmen gehören auch die Menschen in ihrer Umgebung zu meinen bevorzugten Motiven. Damit schaffen wir ein Bewusstsein für andere Kulturen ferner Länder.

Ein paar Bilder aus verschiedenen Ländern und Reisen habe ich beigefügt.

Zur Ausrüstung: Aktuell verwende ich eine Fuji X-E2 Systemkamera mit verschiedenen Objektiven. Von Fuji ist hier das sensationelle 23mm 1.4 dabei und als Allrounder das 18-55 Zoom. Für tolle Effekte nutze ich ein Walimex 12mm 2.0 Fisheye und für Porträtaufnahmen o.ä. ein manuelles Helios 44-4 2.0. Daneben kommen noch ein Canon FD Makro 50mm und ein Canon FD 100 2.8 zum Einsatz.

Die X-E2 bietet eine überragende Bildqualität und ist gleichzeitig durch ihr geringes Gewicht eine tolle Reisekamera. Durch vielfältige Anschlußmöglichkeiten ist sie gut mit allen gängigen Objektiven kombinierbar.


Photography 

Travel Photography is one of my great passions and I think you will love the pictures! 

To get an idea:

http://martinulm.wordpress.com 
http://zeitreisen.zeit.de/interviews/monatsgewinner-februar-martin-mayer-stellt-sich-vor. 

In addition to landscapes, the people in their surroundings belong to my favorite motifs. This will create an awareness of other cultures of distant countries. 

A few pictures from various countries and travels I have attached in the gallery!


Stuff

My favorite Camera is the Fuji X-E2 with 6 different lenses: The great 23mm 1.4 from Fuji and the Zoom 18-55.  For awesome effects I use the Walimex 12mm 2.0 fisheye and for portraits the old Helios 44-4 2.0, further the Canon FD 100mm 2.8 and for a closer look the Canon FD 50mm 3.5 macroTerminplan

Wenn es uns gelingt, hier die entsprechende Summe aufzubringen, werden wir die Reise 2015 antreten. Der genau Termin steht aber noch nicht fest. Über unsere Planungen halten wir Euch natürlich auf dem Laufenden und nehmen gerne auch Feedback entgegen.

Schedule 

If we succeed here to collect the appropriate amount, we will make the trip in 2015. The exact date has not yet been determined. About planning, we of course keep you up to date!Wer wir sind

Wir, das sind Martin und Gabi. Wir sind Ende 40 und seit mehr als 17 Jahren verheiratet. Inzwischen haben wir schon viele Flecken auf der Erde gesehen. So waren wir in Afrika, Asien, in der Karibik und den USA, nicht zu vergessen Österreich :-). Dieses Jahr haben wir bereits Myanmar besucht und waren sehr beeindruckt.

Deutschland haben wir natürlich auch schon erkundet und viele Bereiche Europas.

Wie wir mittlerweile festgestellt haben, lässt die Lust an Fernreisen nicht nach, jedoch die Bereitschaft, lange Flüge zu unternehmen. Die nächsten Jahre wollen wird daher noch nutzen die weite Welt und weiße Flecken zu bereisen, bevor die Kreise dann enger werden und wir in der Nähe bleiben…

Hawaii ist neben Australien (wo wir auch noch nicht waren) eines der meist entfernten Ziele und steht damit weit oben auf der Wunschliste.



About us…

We, that is Martin and Gabi. We are late 40s and married for more than 17 years. We are living near Ulm / Germany. From here, it´s a very long way to Hawaii!

Meanwhile, we have seen a lot of spots on the earth. So we were in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S., not to mention Austria :-). This year we have already visited Myanmar and were very impressed. 

Germany of course we have already explored and many areas of Europe. 

As we have ascertained meanwhile, the desire in long-distance holidays does not decrease, however, the readiness to undertake long distance flights.

The next few years we therefore want to still travel the wide world and visit white spots before the circles are becoming closer and we remain close ... 

Hawaii is (besides Australia, where we also had not been yet) one of the most distant targets, and therefore it is high on our wish list.Weshalb dieser Weg?

„Wenn Du ein Schiff bauen willst, dann trommle nicht Männer zusammen um Holz zu beschaffen, Aufgaben zu vergeben und die Arbeit einzuteilen, sondern lehre die Männer die Sehnsucht nach dem weiten, endlosen Meer.“

Antoine de Saint-ExuperyWeil es eine verrückte Idee ist und es davon viel zu wenig auf dieser Welt gibt?

Weil wir Schwaben sind und uns das Sparen im Blut und den Genen liegt?

Mit dieser Reise möchte ich Euch begeistern und uns einen Traum von Weite erfüllen. Mit Eurer Unterstützung können wir uns einen großen Traum und Ihr Euch durch Eure Beteiligung einen kleinen Traum erfüllen.

Das Projekt soll uns nicht reich machen. Die Projektsumme ergibt sich aus den voraussichtlichen Kosten für die Reise und den Reisenebenkosten.

Sollte sich nach Abschluss der Reise ein Überschuss ergeben, haben wir uns gedacht, diesen Betrag zur Hälfte für wohltätige Zwecke einer gemeinnützigen Organisation (z.B. Ärzte ohne Grenzen) zur Verfügung zu stellen. Die andere Hälfte bildet den Grundstock der Reisekasse für das nächste Abenteuer. Ihr könnt also nicht nur uns etwas Gutes tun, sondern auch anderen Menschen helfen.

Why this way? 

“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”

Antoine de Saint-Exupery 


Because it is a crazy idea and there is far too little of it in this world? 

Because we are Swabia and us is the saving in the blood and genes? 

With this trip, I would like to inspire you and fulfill us a dream. With your support we can make a big dream come true for us and maybe you with your participation make a little dream come true. 

The project will not make us rich. The project total is derived from the estimated cost of the trip and the additional travel costs for my wife and me.

If after completion of the journey we have a surplus, we thought to put that amount in half for charitable purposes to a non-profit organization (like msf.org). The other half forms the basis of the travel budget for the next adventure. You can not just do something good, but also help other people.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Back Shelter is run by its three dedicated co-founders. Trever, who established the company, is an expert creative thinker and came up with the idea of Back Shelter's flagship product. Trever recruited Back Shelter's two other co-founders, Eric and Wei, for technical expertise and engineering development to help realize his vision. Within a few short months Back Shelter went from an innovative concept to a completed design, ready to make outdoor recreation easier and aid embattled people around the world.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489002810/adj1ld8dolob0bv04wp2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back Shelter’s flagship product is the backpack-tent, intended to simplify the camping and hiking industry as well as outdoor recreation as a whole. We have created an all-in-one, single-person tent integrated into a backpack. What we’ve done is design a patent pending, ergonomically fitting containment chamber into the back portion of a backpack. Rather than lug your tent in a separate obtrusive carrying bag, you can now seamlessly and effortless transport your tent anywhere. Slide the tent out of the chamber and fold open the preassembled pop-up tent and your shelter is ready in a matter of seconds. We have reduced the time that it takes to remove your tent from small carrying bags and assemble your shelter. We have eliminated the effort required to tediously haul your tent around with you.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489006670/gxrdjs8zt9vgqoxcebsa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>As we mention above, your funding will be used for our prototyping and development stage. We are all geared up and ready to go with our manufacturers and fabric suppliers. Our prototype design has been finalized and our manufacturers are simply waiting on our word to begin. Once we have our working prototypes we will be able to do rigorous testing and revise our design to enhance your most important product requirements.

<p>We believe that our product will not only make camping, hiking and outdoor recreation easier for the average person, but also help embattled and displaced people around the globe. One of our biggest goals is to have a positive affect on troubled areas of the world. Many refugees struggle to find shelter on a daily basis. We believe strongly that Back Shelter can aid these people.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>One of the obstacles that stands in our way is being able to compete with the large, established brands in the camping and hiking market. This is why we have stressed our testing and development stage so much. We won't be able to compete with those large companies unless our product is perfectly tailored to fit your needs in every way. We know that we can accomplish this with your donations because that is what we are committed to doing.</p>

This is a more intimate way for us to say ""Thank You"" and a fun event for us to meet the contributors who helped us launch our product.

We believe that our product will not only make camping, hiking and outdoor recreation easier for the average person, but also help embattled and displaced people around the globe. One of our biggest goals is to have a positive affect on troubled areas of the world. Many refugees struggle to find shelter on a daily basis. We believe strongly that Back Shelter can aid these people.
 
 
One of the obstacles that stands in our way is being able to compete with the large, established brands in the camping and hiking market. This is why we have stressed our testing and development stage so much. We won't be able to compete with those large companies unless our product is perfectly tailored to fit your needs in every way. We know that we can accomplish this with your donations because that is what we are committed to doing.


We appreciate your help and support even if you can't donate! We are all over social media platforms @BackShelter. You can find us, like us, comment on our images, share our posts with your friends and anything else to help us get the word out. Thank you!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Living in Hawaii and being so visually oriented, I wondered what it would be like to live in one of the most beautiful places on earth, yet never see it with your eyes. I started by contacting Blind organizations to meet visually challenged individuals. This started last May 2010. To keep it localized and about this time and place, each subject was asked if they had a special connection or favorite place in Hawaii, this would become the location for the photo. It also is very telling about the way they experience their life in Hawaii. As this project grew, I realized that these people are just like you or me, why do we separate them as being ""Blind"" it is merely a different way of experiencing the world. Like anyone, there are hopes, dreams, challenges and hardships, yet Life can still be amazing and full. I did not want to photograph victims, but people we can connect to and embrace, something real. Also I wanted to be able to share the images to the people I was photographing. I added text and Braille to everything and for half of the images, a tactile version as well as an audio description. This allows a few different ways to experience one image. Possibly through the individualizing of each sense, we notice how we perceive. </p>

WHO AM I, WHY DO I CARE?
My name is Erin Stevens. Thank you for letting your curiosity bring you to this page.
I am a Bike & Build leader for this year's trip from North Carolina to San Diego.
There is a common theme that motivates me in my pursuit to share with the world about affordable housing issues in our country—Good health and decent shelter underlie good quality of life. 
Quality of life—I cannot think of a cause more worthy of my energy and support. I'm dedicated to this fight and it begins with understanding what stands in our way, becoming educated, and proactively seeking to develop and reform a system which promotes and protects quality of life.
That's what Bike & Build is about, and that mission is what I aim to support and reflect in my efforts as B&B Leader.
 
What We Need & What You Get


By MARCH 17th, I aim to raise: $2,500 USD.
Money raised goes toward B&B's Competitive Grant Program.
B&B Grants fund important affordable housing initiatives across the country.
Your donations are tax-deductible, too!
 


The Impact
BIKE & BUILD funds projects planned and executed by young adults. Over the past 10 seasons we have donated more than $4M; built for more than 120,000 hours; pedaled over 6M miles; and engaged more than 1750 young adults in spreading the word about the affordable housing crisis in America. 
Through our grant program, our organization identifies and supports exciting projects involving young people all throughout the nation. Bike & Build also supports local affordable housing organizations along each route through on the road donations.
By funding building projects involving students and young adults, Bike & Build creates incremental service opportunities among young adults, empowering this crucial demographic.
This work is part of necessary committment to developing or preserving additional units of affordable housing for all Americans.

Stores 6 charges for an iPhone 6, music playback for 96 hours, generates a full charge for a smartphone in less than 4 hours of solar. Can also be charged fully via Micro USB overnight. 2 USB outputs, (1A and 2A) 1 Micro USB input, 1 AUX input.</p><p> </p><p><b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b></p><p><b>   1. How much does Lifepack weigh?</b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>   </b>2.5 lbs total - The Lifepack bag alone weights 1.5lbs (700g) and the Solarbank weights about 1 lb (430g).</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">   </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">2. Battery and Solarbank Information?</b></p><p>The Solarbank can charge from empty to full overnight when you plug it into a wall socket via USB. The Solarbank has 2 USB outputs. 1A and 2A - Normal speed and high speed charging are both supported. When you use the Solarbank to charge your phone it will use some of the battery - then the Solar panel will keep the battery topped up. When you have used one full charge onto your smartphone from the Solarbank - 4-6 hours of sunlight will replenish the battery. Let's say you use the Solarbank to top up your phone 50% each day, and you get 2-3 hours of sunlight per day if you have your bag positioned near a window while you are at work or when you are walking home.

Solarbank is a 3-in-1 Bluetooth Speakers, Solar Panel, and Powerbank! Stores 6 charges for an iPhone 6, music playback for 96 hours, generates a full charge for a smartphone in less than 4 hours of solar. Can also be charged fully via Micro USB overnight. 2 USB outputs, (1A and 2A) 1 Micro USB input, 1 AUX input. Frequently Asked Questions:   1. How much does Lifepack weigh?   2.5 lbs total - The Lifepack bag alone weights 1.5lbs (700g) and the Solarbank weights about 1 lb (430g).   2. Battery and Solarbank Information?The Solarbank can charge from empty to full overnight when you plug it into a wall socket via USB. The Solarbank has 2 USB outputs. 1A and 2A - Normal speed and high speed charging are both supported. When you use the Solarbank to charge your phone it will use some of the battery - then the Solar panel will keep the battery topped up. When you have used one full charge onto your smartphone from the Solarbank - 4-6 hours of sunlight will replenish the battery. Let's say you use the Solarbank to top up your phone 50% each day, and you get 2-3 hours of sunlight per day if you have your bag positioned near a window while you are at work or when you are walking home. By using the Solarbank in this way you would have a net-zero consumption and you could go for weeks on end without needing to charge the Solarbank via a wall plug to top up the battery. We anticipate with standard use that you will need to plug the Solarbank into a wall to top up the power every 2-3 weeks.

Traditional tents are great.  But with the BlackFin you get to cut down on space and time while simultaneously gaining comfort and convenience in thirty seconds or less. The BlackFin comes equipped with a high density foam mattress that is extremely comfortable, and sleeps up to three people. Another camp perk is the extra storage space in the box to store all of your sleeping essentials: blankets, sleeping bags, pillows, and even a memory foam mattress for added comfort.  Say goodbye to condensation and sharp rocks driving into your back! When you're up off the ground, you get to keep your distance from more than just bears or other furry critters. Plus, the Blackfin has ventilation on every side ensuring you stay cool throughout the night.  </p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/073/960/cba5c6a3441bacf9336e64a7c19180f4_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462216111&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=b902aa83d28ba46545fad64a14f94ea0"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/086/339/b0bb04c638fae9794cdfe9740a373f6b_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462302815&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=5c996efcf25306d8fe62afb02bd31ec7"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/091/889/22e5bc8d5c53b4f4f91bd4726826c924_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462339029&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=ce2242ea9e5a23d8536f503c8505c2fa"" src="""" style=""""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/091/871/f6ab09d6f96fcddd6431c0f013fe3ade_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462338887&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=70b83e0e1183e4c2f025b7733df7ddb4"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/007/607/971/2551df1b59a36250138e3e616109f898_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461467320&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=cc118bb6906ac3958cb7cb0799ef11d7"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>It mounts to most vehicles with roof racks and is compatible with both round and square bars.  The maximum load of the tent is 550 pounds and is recommended for up to 2 adults.  It truly is one of the most comfortable ways to camp.  </p><p>The BlackFin is super easy to setup and take down.  All in all it takes about 5 seconds to pop and 30 seconds to take down.  The initial installation of the box onto your car only takes about 15 minutes.  Once installed, just leave it on your car for as long as you want!  The fiberglass body keeps water out so you can keep your tent on your car all year long.</p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/074/119/fbaeef2965e6e2664837f62299706cb3_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462216899&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=689d6d17bdc56e16e1b4262cf0069120"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/074/661/d0681cfcd33dd05a506622eb3cbdd032_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462220246&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=10bb758d30e7a029707b89ecbbec5bdd"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With the easy latch system and pop up technology you will be camping in 30 seconds or less. </span><br/></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/079/201/4cc8bf660d3868a7ce38cc78a29f4a32_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462252473&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=73a2b905f16dd687bfc694354b8506fa"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/085/167/5b927d406ebf746fadb8a3a982c3f30a_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462296583&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=2624535baeeb5e427d6dde2ccd85127d"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/091/913/a6edaf53ace85fc9b617ab84d7f648cd_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462339281&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=87de842f333f8877db386e6f5f39ed84"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/085/109/a1d652532ca927df33fa391f294d2469_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462296343&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=6ee1805c5de31dc5e27e0e0aadb5ccbe"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/007/626/996/fc6a4e9eb1a38d9d44c560e163a6b3b4_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461468489&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=5ee4039a572af550fe0d4b457648cc49"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>The box itself is made of fiberglass and designed to be aerodynamic and cut wind, minimizing the noise and maximizing fuel efficiency.  It is 83 inches from front to back and 50 inches side to side.  When collapsed down, the box is 11 inches tall.  When fully extended in camping mode, the tent is 36 inches tall.</p><p>Using our Auto Rise technology these tents combine heavy duty stainless steel rods to support our high strength, lightweight, canvas material.  The rods use air to expand the tent.

We live for the inspiration that only nature can provide.  Our love for nights sleeping under the stars has inspired us to see what other ways we can camp. The Black Fin Camper Box is a hard shell camper tent that lives on top of your car, truck or SUV. With the quick pop technology you can camp anywhere. You name it! City, beach or mountains, home is where you park it. With a full size mattress built in every box, camping is taken to a new level.The BlackFin camper box is a fantastic way to experience the outdoors. Traditional tents are great.  But with the BlackFin you get to cut down on space and time while simultaneously gaining comfort and convenience in thirty seconds or less. The BlackFin comes equipped with a high density foam mattress that is extremely comfortable, and sleeps up to three people. Another camp perk is the extra storage space in the box to store all of your sleeping essentials: blankets, sleeping bags, pillows, and even a memory foam mattress for added comfort.  Say goodbye to condensation and sharp rocks driving into your back! When you're up off the ground, you get to keep your distance from more than just bears or other furry critters. Plus, the Blackfin has ventilation on every side ensuring you stay cool throughout the night.  It mounts to most vehicles with roof racks and is compatible with both round and square bars.  The maximum load of the tent is 550 pounds and is recommended for up to 2 adults.  It truly is one of the most comfortable ways to camp.  The BlackFin is super easy to setup and take down.  All in all it takes about 5 seconds to pop and 30 seconds to take down.  The initial installation of the box onto your car only takes about 15 minutes.  Once installed, just leave it on your car for as long as you want!  The fiberglass body keeps water out so you can keep your tent on your car all year long.With the easy latch system and pop up technology you will be camping in 30 seconds or less. The box itself is made of fiberglass and designed to be aerodynamic and cut wind, minimizing the noise and maximizing fuel efficiency.  It is 83 inches from front to back and 50 inches side to side.  When collapsed down, the box is 11 inches tall.  When fully extended in camping mode, the tent is 36 inches tall.Using our Auto Rise technology these tents combine heavy duty stainless steel rods to support our high strength, lightweight, canvas material.  The rods use air to expand the tent. The Black Fin Camper Box has a weight of 130 lbs and a max complicity of 550 lbs.The canvas is UV, PU Waterproof, fire retardant, and has strong air permeability giving it a breathable feel and allowing air to flow.  We have used YKK zippers to provide strength and longevity to the zipper. Inside the tent you will find an aluminum telescopic ladder that is extremely lightweight and can bear loads up to 330 pounds.  It fits inside the camper box when collapsed along with sleeping bags, pillows, blankets, etc.  The large net on the roof holds gear while in the tent, and a drop down storage divider on the side provides storage space to stow away headlamps, shoes, or other smaller items.  The BlackFin also includes 2 hanger tabs for your coat or hat. Best of all, just seal the tent back up and your camp is already set when you pop it. We have thought of everything!  Installation is a breeze. In just 15-20 minutes, you will be ready to take your BlackFin Camper Box anywhere.The BlackFin camper box fits on most types / styles crossbar system. It's designed in a way that fits the majority of the bar systems on the market, so don't worry - we've got you covered. We are big fans of the crowdfunding community and everything that this platform offers. We know that we can create an amazing product and be able to offer it at a reasonable price because of the support and intensity of pledgers.  We are so happy to be able to offer this box at a price below most other roof tents. Facebook | Web | InstagramThanks so much for all your support!

Features
pLaces not only gathers information about your loved ones location or your sport activities, it includes several great features. They are small, light, smart and waterproof so you or your loved ones are ready for any kind of adventure
 

 
Safety first
With the help of your mobile device, you can use our pLaces APP to see exactly where your loved ones are on a map, create a safe zone, and get an overview of all your own activities. If you want to know more, just check it!
 

 
Why do i need pLaces?
Their size makes them appear more like an accessory and their main, key feature is that they do not need to be fastened on, they do not need to be put on like an item of clothing, put into a backpack, attached to your wrist, and so on. pLaces are attached nonstop (yes, even shoelaces occasionally need washing) to your shoes, and as even the most forgetful people wear shoes, they do not forget their pLaces at home, unlike other GPS locators. They offer untold use cases, ranging from the localisation of your loved ones (children, grandfathers, grandmothers and friends...), through to your hiking and sports activities.


pLaces measurement is 32mm x 22mm x 12mm and weight is 18g. And yes, it's for everyone! 

No matter if it is raining outside, pLaces can brave puddles, or even go jumping into a stream – no problem.

If you love sports and hiking, pLaces gives you a perfect tracking and overview of all your activities.

We especially thank the moms we could meet with their children.

pLaces KIDS are just amazing!

Create a safe zone (a virtual barrier) and you immediately receive a notification if your loved one leaves this zone. You can also review movements up to 24 hours back in time.

Cool subtle design that doesn't scream ""Tracker""! That's important!
Read it - learn it
Every year on average around one million children go missing on our planet, whether they simply get disoriented, they are overly curious, they are kidnapped, or through violence. Only 2% of them return home.
However, let’s not forget the oldest members of our families. In 2016 alone, around 3 million went missing – due to let’s say old age and other illnesses – however statistics do not say how many of them actually return home. 
If only they had pLaces. The first GPS Shoe Laces of their type in the world. And this is why our idea has become our priority. We want to change the world and make it a safer place.

<p>We started by reviewing our 10 years of unbridled commitment and then turned a fresh page. We went back to the drawing board and asked kayakers what they wanted in a touring kayak. We took all that, prioritized the wants and needs, and got to work. </p>
<p>We shattered our expectations so you can break through your own boundaries. We’re proud of the final result, and we have a feeling you’ll love it too. Say hello to TRAK 2.0, the ULTIMATE Touring Kayak.</p>

<p> Our Kayak may be new, but it’s got thousands of years of tradition behind it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The TRAK 2.0 is based on the indigenous Greenland design, inspired by early kayaks in the Eastern and Western Arctic of Canada's north</li>
<li>We replaced skin on bone or wood with a modern tough-as-nails polyurethane fabric and a hi-tech carbon fibre and aerospace aluminum frame</li>
<li>The hull design has distinctive hard chines and a V-shape for speed and tracking</li>
<li>The hard chine design allows for excellent edging and great secondary stability, which allows for advanced paddling techniques to be applied in a wide variety of conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>We also honoured the origin of kayak design by commissioning Inuit artist, Iziasie Kopalie of Iqaluit, Nunavut to make original Inuit kayak carvings (you can check it out on our website)</p>

<p>Why are we so confident? Well, we’ve been manufacturing and providing top level customer service for over a decade here at TRAK. So we already have many of the key areas completely already set-up. </p>

</div></div>","Reinventing a watercraft that’s over 4,000 years old has not been easy. But it’s been a fun challenge and one heck of a journey. 

Click here to see what World Champion kayaker Ken Whiting had to say about the TRAK 2.0 kayak
 

We started by reviewing our 10 years of unbridled commitment and then turned a fresh page. We went back to the drawing board and asked kayakers what they wanted in a touring kayak. We took all that, prioritized the wants and needs, and got to work. 
We shattered our expectations so you can break through your own boundaries. We’re proud of the final result, and we have a feeling you’ll love it too. Say hello to TRAK 2.0, the ULTIMATE Touring Kayak.

 

 
 



10 years expedition-tested in extreme conditions with TRAK 1.0
Skin-on-frame design, with specially formulated expedition-grade polyurethane material (originally engineered for military use)
Rigid aluminum and carbon fibre frame
All TRAK kayaks are covered by our 5 year warranty


 


 

The entire TRAK 2.0 kayak weighs just 42 lbs (19 kg), made from carbon fibre, aluminum and composite materials
Engineered with extremely high strength-to-weight ratio
Wheel it anywhere or carry it on your back

 



The only kayak that allows you to alter the waterline & rocker for varying environments and needs 
Use the same kayak to play in rough water, or to paddle efficiently for long touring 
Essentially, it's a bunch of differently shaped kayaks in one. You can adjust the rocker even as you paddle 




10 minutes from pack to water
Intuitively designed to be set-up with ease
Allows for convenient, spontaneous outings 




Line of accessories to customize your TRAK experience
Outfitting, bag systems, and other kits available to match your trip requirements
Customization options designed with professional kayak guides 




Kayak packs up into a wheeled travel pack with optional backpack harness
Fits where you need it to: in your car, in your RV, in your condo, on your back, on a train, or on a plane
Optional travel bag system allows you to customize how you transport your gear


 
 



 
 







   

 

 

We designed a touring kayak that not only handles day touring and multi-day touring on water, but can also be toured off the water. It goes wherever the journey takes you. On water, and over land or air. You choose your own adventure.

 

If you set out to make the ultimate anything, you’re gonna need a lot of help. We started with super comprehensive research, getting detailed user input from well over 1,000 kayakers. We wanted the cold hard truth. The pain points. Their preferred paddling experiences and criteria for “ultimate”. We got it.

 
 
 


 

 

 


 In the Wheeled Travel Pack you'll find everything your adventure needs: TRAK 2.0 Kayak | Custom Aquatherm Spray Skirt with sleeve | Waterproof Gear Floatation Bag (set of 2) | Full 5 Year Warranty (see Warranty Page for details)
 


 
The TRAK 2.0 Color Options:

 

We've said it before and we'll say it again: don't let the Indiegogo price tag fool you, this is an unbelievably premium kayak. After the campaign we'll be selling the TRAK 2.0 in retail starting at $3,599 USD.
Incredible value. We're selling it here with a heavy discount to encourage you and the rest of our ever-expanding community to once again get involved in helping us build the TRAK 2.0.
After all, this was designed with the invaluable feedback of our community and other paddlers. The initial design was crowd-sourced, so we thought it'd be cool if our initial production and first orders were crowd-funded.  
By turning to the community for pre-orders, we’re able to offer great value to you, our backers, by increasing our volume, and lowering our manufacturing and distribution costs.
Plus, we thought it to be a great reward for your well-placed trust in us and quick decision making.
Built to Last.Environmentally friendly isn’t just about recycling. It’s also about minimizing waste by owning and using quality products that last. That’s why we created the last kayak anyone would have to own.

Heroclip is a carabiner-style clip on one end, and a hook with a rubber tip for grip on the other. And in-between—a rotating swivel that makes Heroclip infinitely clipable , hookable and usable for hanging your gear.     Whether it’s hooking a lantern to a tree branch, a backpack to a fence, a shopping bag to a stroller, a paint bucket to a ladder or keeping your designer purse off the floor while dining, Heroclip comes to your rescue!  And with this campaign, the Heroclip line will come in multiple sizes and patterns -- just like you asked.       Now in three sizes! (The Original is the Medium).   Additional smaller sizes were the most common request from our backers, and the second most common request was for patterns and designs (did we mention we have very vocal customers?). Check out the addition of a new color and patterns based on our fans’ feedback.Please note: To purchase a patterned Heroclip, please select ""Pattern"" as your color option from the drop-down menu. You will have the opportunity to select your desired pattern later, once the campaign is completed through a survey we will send.And finally, please be aware that two of our patterns are size-specific (i.e., ""Very Serious"" is only available for Heroclip Small and ""Go Play"" is only available for Heroclip Mini, while our Woodland Hero camouflage pattern is available for both). The Woodland Camo Medium is available as part of the Woodland 3-Pack. The camouflage pattern is now unlocked!Available for Mini, Small and Medium (Medium is available as part of the 3-pack). ""Mini"" color options ""Small"" color options We were inspired to create the Sports Set by our partnership with our local WNBA team, the Seattle Storm, and their efforts to engage youth in more sports and active life. Ten percent of sales from this perk will go to Grassroot Soccer, an organization that leverages the power of soccer to educate, inspire, and mobilize at-risk youths to overcome their greatest health challenges and live healthier, more productive lives. [Read more about Grassroot Soccer in the FAQs]. Customized, rad socks that embody our mantra of exploration, fun, functionality and our team’s (bizarre) obsession with spirit animals. Designed by our in-house creative, Ian. We love how our animals are heroically climbing up a daunting and scary cliff, just like we hope you do as well. To make our socks even more awesome, we have partnered with Insect Shield, enemy number one of bugs and insects, to treat our socks with mosquito and insect repellent. We all know how annoying it is to get an itch on your feet -- now, you won’t. [To get socks or bandanas: Make a $12 ""CONTRIBUTION"" (discount from $15) for every unit you would like (e.g., $12 for one item, $24 for two, etc.). You will get a survey after the campaign to tell us how many of each you want. ]  Keep the sun off of your neck, hair out of your eyes, use it as a napkin, wrap a gift. It’s hard to think of a piece of clothing that can do as much as a bandana can (and you know how we at Heroclip are all about products that do more). The cool graphics here match the Hero socks and the Luci design, so get them all! To make it even more essential, we are treating the bandana with Insect Shield, an insect and mosquito repellent. Stylish, useful and helps you from being chewed up by bugs -- sounds like a no-brainer to us.   [To get socks or bandanas: Make a $12 ""CONTRIBUTION"" (discount from $15) for every unit you would like (e.g., $12 for one item, $24 for two, etc.). You will get a survey after the campaign to tell us how many of each you want. ] Everything you need to be in your own hero, everyday. One Heroclip of each size, a pair of socks and a bandana. Heroclip and out custom Luci lantern (Pro Series, Outdoor 2.0 model, valued at $39.95) -- we've got a few things in common. Both our products are weather-proof, durable, and adventure-obsessed. And they both utilize patented technology (not many can make that claim!) These are just a few of the reasons why we're partnering up to empower everyday heroes.Luci is a solar inflatable light, with a USB charge port that powers our phones while we're on-the-go. Together, Heroclip and Luci created a custom design, that reflects the ways both products seamlessly adapt to any environment or circumstance. The custom Luci and the 3 matching Heroclips are beautiful and smart—just like the way we do, well, everything. [Learn more about Luci and our partnership in the FAQs.]  We know that some of you are “one-of-a kind” people.  For you, we created the Founder Series, an exclusive edition of Heroclip, available just for our backers in super limited quantities. Just as crowdfunding is in our DNA, so are the glorious mountains of Washington, as they were the inspiration behind the invention of Heroclip. We start our Founder Series with ""Mt. Rainier"" in all three sizes, and as our campaign reaches certain milestones, we will release new models for the series. This Mt. Rainier clip pattern was designed by our in-house creative director, Ian. This one is for those who really love us and can’t get enough of Hero stuff.  Three each of every size we make, 2 sets of Heroclip x Luci, 2 pairs of Hero socks, 2 bandannas. The colors of the Heroclips will be red, blue, one surprise. Our partner, the WNBA’s Seattle Storm (Seattle’s one and only professional basketball team!), has partnered with us to offer Heroclip backers a suite for a mutually agreed-upon game where you will not only get to root for some of the strongest and most athletic women in the country but also enjoy delicious food and drinks. AND each guest gets 3 Heroclips (one of each size), a pair of socks and bandanna.  AND you get to hang out with the Heroclip team!   As a company, we were born from crowdfunding and successfully delivered two products. Over the past year, we've built several rounds of prototypes of the new sizes of Heroclip. We have put everything we learned about manufacturing, quality control and logistics from our previous production and created a process to ensure that all of our production goes as smoothly as possible. Our company already has a track record of delivering products to crowdfunding backers and we have produced and sold over 220,000 units in the lifetime of this line.  The quality of our existing product is high enough to have been placed in large retailers like REI, Brookstone and ACE Hardware, and our capacity is robust enough to fulfill these orders.Despite our company's success so far, the reality is that producing goods in high enough volume so that they are affordable to all (we truly believe that the Heroclip line will benefit EVERYONE's lives) requires capital.  With your help, we can bring the extended Heroclip family to life!  We have production and quality figured out.  Please check out some of our customers' comments about the Original Heroclip!  Several years ago, Heroclip inventor, Mina Yoo had a baby, decided to summit Mt. Rainier and moved into a fixer-upper home all within a few months of each other.  With this series of events, she had a profound realization: Two hands are not enough to for the gear that comes with living a full life. Tired of suffering silently (or not so silently, some might say), Mina decided to invent an ""extra hand"" in the simplest form possible. With the help of award-winning consumer product designer, John Bandringa, Heroclip is the result, and thanks to the backers on Indiegogo, we were able to bring the first Heroclip model to life, to a great deal of acclaim and positive feedback.  With the success of the original Heroclip, Mina now has a team who makes sure that the whole world can enjoy a more carefree, adventurous lifestyle, with the help of Heroclip.Our team has successfully launched and delivered hundreds of thousands of units of the Heroclip line and includes a veteran product designer, product developer and manufacturing engineer who collectively have 60+ years of experience in bringing completed products to the hands of users.  We think that making a physical product that help make daily life more manageable and adventurous is one of the coolest things we could do. Check out how we made endless prototypes of the new sizes to make sure we had the shape and size as optimal as possible. And then, we tested them to make sure that we deliver on what we promise. There are always challenges when making a new product. Before selecting our current factory, our team made extensive visits to various manufacturers, interviewing them and reviewing their work to select the right partner.  Having selected one, we have worked closely with them to ensure that communication lines, quality expectations and delivery timelines are crystal clear. Andy, our manufacturing engineer, is based in Hong Kong and maintain daily contact with our manufacturing partner and visit them at least weekly to ensure that we are on schedule and quality standards are met or exceeded.  1. How do I get multiple perks?After you get your first perk, go back to the campaign and now make a ""CONTRIBUTION"" for the sum of all the additional perks you would like.  After the campaign, we will send you a form so you can tell us what perks you would like. 2. How do I add those cool socks and bandanas?The socks and bandanas will retail for $15 each. However, for our backers, we will provide a discount of 20% ($3 off!). So, if you would like some, please make a ""CONTRIBUTION"" of $12 for each unit you want (so, $24 for two, $36 for three, etc.). After the campaign, we will send you a form so you can tell us how many of which you would like. 3. Why Heroclip?Heroclip was launched as a crowdfunding campaign in 2014 (under the name ""Qlipter""). The second generation, ""Qliplet,"" was born a year later. In mid-2017, we decided to rebrand as “Heroclip” as the new name embodied our spirit and desire to turn everyone into heroes who fit the extraordinary into their days (plus nobody knew how to pronounce ""Qlipter"" and ""Qliplet"").Heroclip has two folding hinges and a rotating joint to help hanging items find their natural center of gravity. The foot of of the hook has a rubber overmold to increase grip when resting on surfaces. Our Heroclips are made out of solid aluminum using CNC machining.This allows us to offer more colors and a smooth, anodized finish on our new models. Heroclips hold up to 40, 50, or 60 lbs depending on the model. 4. What’s Luci and what’s up with your partnership?At Heroclip, we are about creating innovative solutions for every day and in the process, empowering everyday heroes to do what they already do, more easily. Mpowerd (the awesome company that makes Luci) believes that through clean, affordable light, they make the world a brighter place for the people who still live without reliable access to electricity. This is, of course, a cause we can really hang with. 5. Why give to Grassroot Soccer?We were introduced to Ethan Zohan the co- founder of Grassroot Soccer last year when we  sponsored a fun run benefiting the organization. We were struck by the work he and his organization does and the similarities in our values:  We both believe in active life, education and becoming change agents in our communities. Read more about this awesome organization here. 6. When are the Seattle Storm playing?Check out the schedule here, then join us! 7.  How/when will you ship?This isn’t our first rodeo!

 8. I can't close my Heroclip. Is it broken?To open and close your Heroclip, the gate needs to be pressed in and the top hook needs to be swiveled/ swung to the side of the biner/ clip section, as demonstrated in this video. Your Heroclip nests on top of the biner. It will not close if you try to close the hook over the top of the biner. We promise, it’s not broken -- see our video for a demo! 9. What is Herocrew?Herocrew is a quickly growing closed Facebook group where our community members discuss, share, vote and engage with each other about Heroclip.

The pack contains a 5600mAh portable charger; a powerful speaker; a global hotspot; smart light, temperature and humidity sensor and memory storage all in one form factor - and because it’s Moduware™ you can upgrade it anytime! Why Travelpack?After speaking to hundreds of travelers we realized we could build a fun and powerful tool that combined a speaker, hotspot, battery and smart light, and memory storage all into the one device that makes life on the road that much easier. Think of it as your own personal digital swiss army knife!The Moduware Travelpack comes with a set of 5 mods and a wallet to carry around your Modpack plus all your everyday essentials like cards, cash, chargers, and extra mods!What can you do with the Travelpack? Recharge your smartphone - fastFirst and foremost the Travelpack is a slim portable charger with 5600mah capacity. This means you’ll always have it with you, and because it’s a smart charger - you’ll get an alert to your smartphone when the battery is running low, so unlike other chargers, you’ll always remember to charge it. Hit the ground running with our Global Hotspot/Dual Sim ModuleThe Travelpack contains a global hotspot module and access to international roaming data plans that will allow you to get going as soon as you land. Thanks to this module you and your friends and family can keep your existing sim in your phone and just tether to your Travelpack for calls and data with ease. If you want more data than what our roaming plan offers, simply buy a local sim and replace ours with yours. The dual sim capability also provides all iPhone and many android users a way to make and receive calls with ease, no matter what country or region you are in!  Ensure your Holiday is lit with our multi-colored Smart Light!Each TravelPack contains a powerful multicolor LED lamp module that you can set to wake you up in the morning; as well as tackle jet lag with our blue light feature; or get the party started by syncing it to your music.The powerful Multi Coloured LED Lamp is great for various traveling needs. A nightlight for the kids, a lamp for the tent or even use our cool themes to set the mood and get the party started! Music while on the move with our portable speakerThe Travelpack speaker is going to be a great addition to your next trip. Without the usual bulk of a standalone speaker and connected to your portable charger, it’s the perfect option for your backpack. Designed with travelers of all kinds in mind, the Speaker will provide crystal clear audio, podcasts and music for your for trips to the beach, hangs in your hostel and generally just dropping your favorite tracks all day, every day! We have also added a microphone array into the speaker to allow for business conferencing calls or even just chats with family and friends back home.  Check the weather, temperature and humidity in any location.Don’t rely on the weather app and cellular coverage, get real-time temperature and humidity data wherever you are in the world in a moment. Whether you’re climbing mountains, sitting by the beach, or just trekking through the concrete jungle it’s always interesting to know the exact elements you’re dealing with as you explore and wander the world. Never run out of space for all your photos!With our new and improved Memory module we are giving both iOS and Android users the ability to move photos and videos from their phone to an external memory device. Take all the photos and videos of the great places, people and memories that you experience without the worry of having to delete other photos and videos for space. just slide them across to our Memory module and keep on snapping!Endless possibilitiesBecause Travelpack is a Moduware device you can upgrade your Travelpack and overtime fully customise it to your needs. We also invite you to join our developer community so if you’re an engineer, programmer, maker or just a hobbyist you can build your own modules right on top of our platform. As we’re partnered with MAXIM and ADI too, and have a vibrant community of developers, over time there’ll be many more modules in the future to choose from! Upcoming modulesTravelpack is not just limited to the modules you will receive in the first Indiegogo pack. We are working towards getting more and more interesting Travel devices in your hands and away with you on your holidays. To come in the near future is a UHF Radio (Walkie Talkie) module, a Laser Range Finder and a LoRa device. Control it all from an appThe features above are all controlled by our free iOS and Android apps that are now available in the App Store. Simply type Moduware into the App Store or Google Play Store or scan either of these QR codes to be directed to the app. You can download it now if you’re curious to play with it and get familiar with how it works. Where we are todayAfter three years of development and design, we have launched Modpack, the world’s first modular power bank. Modpack and its modules make up the core proprietary technology behind Travelpack. Our power banks and modules are now in mass production, however we need your help to finish the global hotspot module, the leather carry case, and the second general memory module to make it compatible with Apple devices (first generation was Android phones only). The speaker is undergoing a major upgrade to give it even more power. 

 

The Modsquad
Our team isn’t made up of just us, it includes you too! We have created an exclusive forum on facebook for all of our Moduware users. The group is designed provide support as quickly as we can, answer your questions and allow us to ask for your opinion on a variety of topics. We are using the first of our backers to help shape the company as well with new beta modules being sent out for testing and feedback, as well as interesting updates on design and production. We feel very strongly about keeping you and our community of users involved and hope to hear all your great ideas and thoughts on the product and platform!
\

 What the future holds We’ve been building Moduware for over three years now and the product is in production and available on our website and coming soon to Amazon.com. The Travelpack is built on the same proprietary platform but customized to the needs of travelers. All the modules are currently built - except one, the global hotspot. The speaker and memory modules are also undergoing an upgrade to improve quality even more. Tech specsTravelpack

Why do we need to get there? Ladies Army brings together an assortment of players with unique and rich experiences from all walks of life.

The goal of the event was to help women players network, build skills, and for those going, get their teams ready for Ladies Army 6. </p><p>After the Summit, we wanted to do more. We wanted to represent the many different experiences of women in polo and this is where our idea for the guidebook came in. </p><p>In order to create a guidebook that bike polo clubs can reference, we have the following plans and timeline:</p><p></p><p>June-October, 2014</p><ul>
<li><p><b>Interviews:</b> network with and interview women polo players at Ladies Army about their experiences in bike polo and their perspective on increasing women's participation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Analyze interviews:</b> identify common themes women players experience when playing polo, identify any issues or problems they’ve had in bike polo, identify suggestions and solutions players have for increasing women’s participation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Write final guidebook:</b> create guidebook to building participation based on discussions with women polo players. Get feedback on guidebook from bike polo community, revise guidebook based on feedback.</p></li>

Instead of hockey sticks, we have mallets that we use to maneuver and hit the ball to score. If you touch the ground with your foot, you must tap the wall at the center of the court with your mallet to re-enter the play.

While bike polo is an all-gender sport, women are a minority, and in many city clubs, completely absent. By developing resources and special events, we hope to break down barriers to women’s participation in this growing sport. Our fundraiser will help us travel to Ladies Army 6, a women’s majority tournament held in Toronto, Canada, where we will interview women players to identify barriers and brainstorm solutions. Our findings will shape the writing of a free guidebook for bike polo clubs and the community to better encourage and support women players.
Getting to Ladies Army.We’re asking you to help us with the first phase of our project: to get us to Ladies Army. Why do we need to get there? Ladies Army brings together an assortment of players with unique and rich experiences from all walks of life. Our goal is to increase women’s participation in bike polo by interviewing women bike polo players to understand their perspectives and experiences and to find solutions. We'll create a free guidebook for clubs to better support and include women players.Ladies Army 6 is a women's majority bike polo tournament that brings together women from around the world to compete, encourage, support, teach, and learn from each other. It is taking place in Toronto, Canada June 20th-23rd. Here is the promotion video for Ladies Army 5, last year's tournament. Ladies Army 5 from Geoffrey Tomlin-Hood on Vimeo.How are we going to accomplish our goal?We've already started. Last April, we organized and hosted the first ever all women's bike polo tournament in California, the California Ladies Bike Polo Summit. We had women from around the world attend, with over 8 teams competing. The goal of the event was to help women players network, build skills, and for those going, get their teams ready for Ladies Army 6. After the Summit, we wanted to do more. We wanted to represent the many different experiences of women in polo and this is where our idea for the guidebook came in. In order to create a guidebook that bike polo clubs can reference, we have the following plans and timeline:June-October, 2014
Interviews: network with and interview women polo players at Ladies Army about their experiences in bike polo and their perspective on increasing women's participation.
Analyze interviews: identify common themes women players experience when playing polo, identify any issues or problems they’ve had in bike polo, identify suggestions and solutions players have for increasing women’s participation.
Write final guidebook: create guidebook to building participation based on discussions with women polo players. Get feedback on guidebook from bike polo community, revise guidebook based on feedback.
November, 2014Distribute guidebook: the finished guidebook will be made available for free download and marketed through popular bike polo blogs. Jenny is a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of California, Davis and has extensive training and experience in conducting and analyzing in-depth interviews. Where did our inspiration come from?As the only three women between two city clubs, we wanted to find ways to get more women playing. We began hosting women-only polo events which dramatically increased women's attendance to pickup and co-ed practices! Our success made us curious to find other ways to increase women's participation.To learn more about the Trixies team, visit our website. How will we say thank you?In exchange for your support, and as an expression of our gratitude, we're giving you, our donors, a couple of fun perks:

What is bike polo?Bicycle polo is an all-gender sport that infuses cycling and the basic principles of hardcourt hockey with teams of three attempting to score five points. Instead of hockey sticks, we have mallets that we use to maneuver and hit the ball to score. If you touch the ground with your foot, you must tap the wall at the center of the court with your mallet to re-enter the play. Bike polo is a fun and fast-paced game that requires agility, strength and endurance. Future projects:We have lots of ideas that we plan to roll out over the next year, stay tuned!

Website and blog: create a website and blog written by women discussing bike polo in general and issues important to women in polo


California Women’s Bike Polo Academy: organize and host the first ever training camp for women players. The focus will be on drills and skill-building to increase women's competitive edge in bike polo

<p>Hi!  We are Deb and Helen, the co-owners of RIDE Oakland, Oakland's first dedicated indoor-cycling studio.  We would like to tell you a little about ourselves and our campaign to support RIDE Oakland in opening its doors next month.  </p>
<p>Over three years ago, I (Deb), a fitness enthusiast and physical therapist, opened up a small cycling studio in my garage after not finding an adequate place to spin in Oakland.  With five bikes, a mediocre boom box, a few good hearted neighbors,  ""Garagespin"" was born.  Quite unexpectedly, and with an eventual 6 additional bikes, Garagespin became this awesome community of amazing individuals who were gathering at the wee hours of the morning to conquer, challenge, laugh, and start their day with the knowledge that they had already achieved something great.  Helen joined the Garagespin team as an instructor after about a year, further enriching the whole experience with her infectious laugh and tough workouts.</p>
<p>As wonderful as it has been, Garagespin has outgrown itself and the need for a bigger indoor-cyling studio has grown.  Helen and I have had the vision to open a space where we could continue this great vibe of community, inclusiveness, hard work, and fun but with a few more bikes,  more class times, and the ability to reach more people.  <br/></p>
<p>We have combed Oakland for over a year searching for the ideal location for our studio. We believe we have found it on Piedmont Avenue!   RIDE will open just a block from the beautiful Mountain View Cemetery in a safe neighborhood with plenty of street parking.  The space, however, has required MUCH more work than we initially thought (have you seen the pictures of the bathrooms on our FB page??) and thus we have started this campaign to raise money to help us finish the build out.  We are almost there and hope to open around Thanksgiving, but just need a bit of help with the finishing touches.  </p>
<p>We are asking that you please consider contributing to our campaign!  Your contribution will go directly to making RIDE the awesome place we know it can be.  Even if you don't live in Oakland/Piedmont and have no chance of taking a class at RIDE, please know that your contribution will go a long way in promoting health and fitness for others (and will just make a whole bunch of people really happy!).  </p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, you can also contribute by liking us on Facebook, spreading the word about our studio, and trying us out for a RIDE!  Thank you!!</p>

</p><p>Hola! I am MJ Moyer-Fittipaldi and
I am a current sophomore at Temple University and a brother of ΑΦΩ. I have been
awarded a summer long internship with Pura Vida missions based out of San
Ramon, Costa Rica. After being a short-term missionary for a week, I knew I
wanted to come back for the summer. Pura Vida’s catch phrase is “it’s not an
event, but a life”. And even after being a “mission trip veteran” at Christ
Lutheran Church, with experiences from around the world, all it took was
spending a week in Costa Rica to embrace that phrase for the rest of my life. During that week I
was able to help run “Campamento de
Ninos” which is Pura Vida’s version of Vacation Bible School for children in
the area. We traveled to two sites a day and shared the Gospel with over 50
children a day, not including the other teams working at additional sites! Pura
Vida Missions also runs a sponsorship program for the children in the area who
cannot afford to go to school. Being able to go back for three months to
interact with these kids and to use my serving heart is the chance of a life
time. I’m incredibly excited to use my gifts to impact the lives of many, as
they have already changed mine. </p><p>
</p><p>Pura Vida is a great organization
and I am so blessed to be going there for the summer. As you can imagine this
must be expensive! That’s where you come in. In total, I need to raise $3,000 to cover
things from airfare to a weekly stipend for food when the short term
missionaries are not there. Your donation will be greatly appreciated and will
receive a huge “Gloria a Dios!” Check out what your individual donation could
do with the perks that I have set up. Also, Donations to Pura Vida are tax deductible!
</p><p>
</p><p>I also understand that not all
donations are monetary. Well wishes, prayers, and positive thoughts are always appreciated. Feel free to leave a comment in support of our mission.  In addition, please  spread the word about my campaign to friends, family, Facebook, and/or other social media sites. </p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>""Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms"" 1 Peter 4:10</p><p>

<h2><strong>Who am I?</strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""> <img alt=""Picture of seth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.landtohouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pic-of-seth.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Me""/></p>
<p>My name is Seth Johnson. I graduated from East Tennessee State University with an engineering degree. I really enjoy working with water! I have been testing out micro hydro power and working with water pumps for over a year now. </p>
<h2><strong>What is the PVC Water Wheel?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt=""Water wheel design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.landtohouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wheel-specs.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""water wheel""/></strong></p>
<p>            The PVC Water Wheel allows you to transport water from a moving stream or river uphill several feet to a desired location without the use of electricity or fuel. Scoops or Paddles catch water and this turns the wheel just like a traditional water wheel. A catch tube collects water then air sequentially on every turn of the wheel and funnels it inwards. As the wheel turns the water is pressurized by the air and by the time that it reaches the end of the tube it has the pressure needed to flow uphill.</p>
<p>            My design utilizes PVC that is easy to work with and just as easy to find in your local plumping store. Because the pump needs to work in all water depths I am designing a base that can float and another that will rest on the ground. </p>
<h2><strong> What is the End Goal for the PVC Water Wheel Pump?</strong></h2>
<p>          Because the pump is in the early development stage, I will be writing an eBook as the finished product as of right now. This will be a detailed step by step instructional book on how to make the pump. It will include several variations that will allow the builder the opportunity to select the appropriate wheel design for the water supply he or she is working with. The eBook will give important information about the technical details including water output vs. tube diameter and wheel size vs. pump velocity.  Much more information will be included in the eBook. When the eBook has been written I will then begin looking into the production of pump models to be sold.                            <img alt=""The eBook"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.landtohouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ebook2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""book""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>What will your contribution do?</strong></h2>
<p>            The basic pump design is finished but now it’s time to test the design in the real world. Your contribution will help buy the components that I need to build models and place them in the water. I invision the water wheel pump meeting the needs of many different size water ways. This means that I need to test the size of the pump and the way that it sits in the water. For larger water ways the pump needs to float and for smaller water its ok to have it sitting on the ground. I also need to test the amount of flow that can be produced and that means that I also need to have working models for pipe diameter.</p>
<p>So basically your contribution will help me make this pump customizable for many water pumping needs.</p>
<p>I expect the final product to cost around $100 a pump. Testing the pump should move quickly and results should lead to a reliable and effective pump. </p>
<h2><strong>Why is this pump important?</strong></h2>
<p>            There are so many applications that the pump can be used for. Say you have cattle on a hill and you don’t want to allow them into the creek below. Instead of pumping water to them with a traditional fuel consuming pump you can use the water wheel pump to fill a tank without any fuel cost.</p>
<p>            Or say you have a garden next to your house and you have been watering with your well water or city water using electricity or paying money to use the water. Well with the water wheel pump you can bring the water up from a river or stream and not pay again.</p>
<p>Now there are other uses for this pump. For those living in areas that do not have running water to wash clothes and drink, this pump can be used to fill water storage tanks and then allow for pressurized water to be delivered to a home.</p>
<p>Farmers can use the pump also. Stepping up the wheel to a large model will allow for a larger volume of water. Now for large amounts of water movement, although not “green”, it is possible to attach a small gas motor to the wheel to allow pumping on nonmoving water. Because the wheel is balanced it does not take much force to move the wheel. </p>
<h2><strong>What is Land to House?</strong></h2>
<p>            I purchased a little track of land this past year and it has a creek running across the middle of it. This will be the location of the first tests of the water wheel pump. The website that I have made will house the updates of the water wheel progress so that you can keep up with what is going on. The site is just getting started and I am always adding more on it.

</div></div>","Who am I?
 
My name is Seth Johnson. I graduated from East Tennessee State University with an engineering degree. I really enjoy working with water! I have been testing out micro hydro power and working with water pumps for over a year now. 
What is the PVC Water Wheel?

            The PVC Water Wheel allows you to transport water from a moving stream or river uphill several feet to a desired location without the use of electricity or fuel. Scoops or Paddles catch water and this turns the wheel just like a traditional water wheel. A catch tube collects water then air sequentially on every turn of the wheel and funnels it inwards. As the wheel turns the water is pressurized by the air and by the time that it reaches the end of the tube it has the pressure needed to flow uphill.
            My design utilizes PVC that is easy to work with and just as easy to find in your local plumping store. Because the pump needs to work in all water depths I am designing a base that can float and another that will rest on the ground. 
 What is the End Goal for the PVC Water Wheel Pump?
          Because the pump is in the early development stage, I will be writing an eBook as the finished product as of right now. This will be a detailed step by step instructional book on how to make the pump. It will include several variations that will allow the builder the opportunity to select the appropriate wheel design for the water supply he or she is working with. The eBook will give important information about the technical details including water output vs. tube diameter and wheel size vs. pump velocity.  Much more information will be included in the eBook. When the eBook has been written I will then begin looking into the production of pump models to be sold.                            


What will your contribution do?
            The basic pump design is finished but now it’s time to test the design in the real world. Your contribution will help buy the components that I need to build models and place them in the water. I invision the water wheel pump meeting the needs of many different size water ways. This means that I need to test the size of the pump and the way that it sits in the water. For larger water ways the pump needs to float and for smaller water its ok to have it sitting on the ground. I also need to test the amount of flow that can be produced and that means that I also need to have working models for pipe diameter.
So basically your contribution will help me make this pump customizable for many water pumping needs.
I expect the final product to cost around $100 a pump. Testing the pump should move quickly and results should lead to a reliable and effective pump. 
Why is this pump important?
            There are so many applications that the pump can be used for. Say you have cattle on a hill and you don’t want to allow them into the creek below. Instead of pumping water to them with a traditional fuel consuming pump you can use the water wheel pump to fill a tank without any fuel cost.
            Or say you have a garden next to your house and you have been watering with your well water or city water using electricity or paying money to use the water. Well with the water wheel pump you can bring the water up from a river or stream and not pay again.
Now there are other uses for this pump. For those living in areas that do not have running water to wash clothes and drink, this pump can be used to fill water storage tanks and then allow for pressurized water to be delivered to a home.
Farmers can use the pump also. Stepping up the wheel to a large model will allow for a larger volume of water. Now for large amounts of water movement, although not “green”, it is possible to attach a small gas motor to the wheel to allow pumping on nonmoving water. Because the wheel is balanced it does not take much force to move the wheel. 
What is Land to House?
            I purchased a little track of land this past year and it has a creek running across the middle of it. This will be the location of the first tests of the water wheel pump. The website that I have made will house the updates of the water wheel progress so that you can keep up with what is going on. The site is just getting started and I am always adding more on it. You can check it out now: http://www.landtohouse.com

Perks - What will you get by helping?
$5 -  I will send you an email when the campaign is over with a Big Thank You!
$10 -  I will send you a bumper sticker in the mail with my land to house logo along with a thank you for your support. This contribution will go a long way in helping me finish the wheel.
 
$25 - When the design testing is finished and perfected I will be sending you the eBook! The book will be loaded with all the information that I have collected over the testing period. After you read the book you will be set and ready to make your very own water wheel pump. Along with the eBook you will get the bumper sticker. 
          
$50 - I will send you a logo tote bag from Land to House with the eBook and bumper sticker! you will be able to hold all kinds of goodies with this bag. 
  
$100 - I will send you a Land to House logo hat! This hat is a Flex Fit hat! that means that it will fit your head right and look good. You will also get the eBook as well as the sticker. 
  
$200 - I will send you the Logo hat, Logo Tote bag, eBook, and sticker! 
 
$1000 - I will send you the water wheel pump parts ready to be assembled so that you can make your very own pump right out of the box! You will also get the Logo Hat, Logo tote, eBook, and sticker.

</div></div>","As you may have heard Kelsey Eyer is getting hitched to Joe Olk. WHAT?! Crazy, I know. Ok, ok... it's hardly a surprise, and for a lot of you, you're probably thinking, ""It's about damn time."" Some of you are so excited about this prospect that you may feel inclined to show your excitement by wanting to shower us with amazing gifts and surprises. This is completely natural, especially because Kelsey is pretty great. That Joe character seems a tad odd though. To keep this easy for everyone, and so people didn't have to schlep things across a mountain range we decided to go with this simple and digital option. It should be noted that you don't have to spend in $10 dollar increments, feel free to put in whatever you fancy. (HOORAY FUTURE TECHNOLOGY)
DISCLAIMER: THE $500 DOLLAR GOAL ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT A SPECIFIC MONETARY AMOUNT TO START THE CAMPAIGN. WE DON'T WANT IT TO SEEM DAUNTING OR RIDICULOUS. OUR APOLOGIES FOR THE CONFUSION IT MAY HAVE CAUSED.We have 3 options for you to choose from.

Honeymoon Vacation - The two of us love to travel, and though we'll be unable to go anywhere immediately after the wedding, we are planning on a belated honeymoon sometime in 2015. Where will it be, you ask? We're not sure yet, so feel free to leave a suggestion in our inbox.

New Bed - The bed we're currently using is old, and it hurts Joe's back because he's an old cantankerous man. So, we're going to get a new one, and with your help it can be a fancy one. 


Household Odds and Ends - We've recently moved into a new place and have noticed that there's a few things we probably should have or replace. This option refers to variety of gizmos and widgets that help make our modern lives ever so convenient.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As you may know, it is not easy for the WLV out there.  It's not necessarily liked by folks that have invested heavily in other cartridges, and it threatens a couple of the more popular ones out there, which will hurt certain folks' bank accounts.  The WLV is ""The little cartridge that does"".  If you're here I probably don't need to convince you of that.  In order for the WLV to make it onto shelves across the country, it needs to go SAAMI.  In order to go SAAMI, we need to buy a lot of custom brass and other equipment.  As a team, all of us can make this happen together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is pretty simple.  Custom headstamp brass is incredibly expensive.  You either have to have enough to place an order for 250,000 pieces which is around $100,000, or you need to pay more for smaller quantities.  We're shooting for somewhere in the middle.  After the headstamp brass we need to buy transducers and pressure barrels to use for testing in the lab.</p>
<p>What do you get?  Right now, if you review the Perks, the amount of actual brass you receive is based on us not meeting our goal, which is possible, so we would need to pay more per case.  If we are able to meet or surpass our goal, the amount of brass you receive in each Perk level <u><strong>triples</strong></u>.  So, if we meet or surpass our goal, for $100, you don't get 50 brass, you get 150 brass.  You'll see we sweetened the deal a bit each Perk level as well, including the shirt and autographed WLV print.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact here is that the community itself will show it wants this cartridge on the market; on shelves across the country.  It is primed to be the ""If I can only have one"" cartridge for the MSR.  The big guys out there are reluctant to be supportive because the WLV will threaten and hurt sales of a few other popular cartridges, in which they are heavily invested.  So, show them that they cannot keep the WLV down and they should hop on board.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are trying to make this less risky and challenging.  The short version is this.  This is a flexible fund, so even if we do not make our initial goal, we will still put all of the funds towards however much brass we can get and distribute, along with the shirts and autographed prints depending on your level of contribution.  </p>
<p>The biggest challenge we will face is spreading the word enough to raise enough funds in just 60 days.  <strong>The time limit here for a campaign is only 60 days.</strong>  Please share this with anyone you know that might want to see this happen, definitely wants to see this happen or perhaps just wants to help see a little guy get on the big stage.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to spread the word and make some noise about the campaign.</li>
<li>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>My love affair with traveling started young on small family trips to
neighboring states. My love of photography started with my first photo class in
8<sup>th</sup> grade (possibly even before that). In high school both were
intensified with a school trip to England &amp; Scotland. After that I studied
at the Maine College of Art, getting a degree in Graphic Design but with a
heavy focus in photography. For the next 10 years the only international
travel was a couple weeks in Egypt, quick trip to England, and a
visit to the Czech Republic, although I got to see many states and experience a
number of the United States' most remarkable places (hiking the Grand Canyon,
Antelope Canyon, and many of Utah's state&amp; national parks, just to name a
few, while already living in the dreamy Rocky Mountains of Colorado).
I’ve enjoyed sharing and selling my photography at craft fairs and other events
during these years, but those have been sporadic and my passion for it has
subsequently stayed closer to the hobby level. In January 2012 I made a
decision to combine my love of travel and passion for photography and follow my
dreams of becoming a traveling photographer. </p>
<p>I stopped making excuses (I don't have enough money/too much debt to
plan any serious travel, I've got a lease/job to worry about, and the list goes
on and on) and instead started making a plan. Once I made that decision I’ve
since paid off debts, saved up money, and researched like crazy. On August
28th, 2014 I have a one-way ticket out of the country on a planned year-long
solo trip around the world. I'm planning to stay an average of about 1 month in
each country, although I'm also pretty open to staying longer if it feels
right. During this time I'm signed up for different volunteer &amp; work
exchange programs, as well as some extreme adventures (for one example look up
Bloukrans Bridge, if you don't already know what it is). My goal is
to get to know the country personally and make real connections with the local
residents, and reflect those connections through my photography.</p>
<p>*Disclaimer - The sole purpose of this fundraiser is so that you can be part
of the journey! I want everyone to understand that I am not looking for you to
pay for my trip - I have been working like crazy for the past 2.5 years to make
this happen (and at 30 years old I moved back in with the parents to help save
on rent - so I’ve earned this!), and I'm going with or without any donations
(although if you do just wish to donate to see me make my dreams come true
without regard to the perks, you are still welcome to). With having the couple
years to plan this, and talking to everyone I meet about it non-stop, it’s come
along with many people asking me to send them postcards, or pick up trinkets,
and although I would love to, I honestly can't afford to do that on the budget
of my savings. So, this is all about what your donation can get you! I’ve made
the perks to try and satisfy both requests that I have gotten to some great
photography print options for those of you that appreciate the art of it all.
If you have a request that you don’t see on the list (I know Sarah wants her
jewelry!), send me a message and we may be able to work out something
personally. </p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>As stated previously, the funds raised here are entirely to allow you to
join me on this special journey (unless you want to donate just to support me
following my dreams), and are my means of covering my cost of providing this
opportunity. Barring a serious injury or worse, based on deposits/full payments
and reservations made, I am guaranteed to make it to at least Costa Rica, S.
Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe &amp; India. Providing everything is going well and
the funds I’ve saved up are still on track, I plan to continue on to Thailand,
Laos, Bali, Australia, Fiji, then to Hawaii and back onto the Continental US.
However, just as I am open to staying somewhere longer, I am also open to
changing my plans as opportunities arise – I could easily end up adding a trek
in Nepal, taking a boat ride to the Maldives, or going anywhere else intriguing
on the way that I find is worth a stop at. Progress of the trip will be updated
on my website/blog (<a href=""http://www.audreyadventurer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.audreyadventurer.com</u></a>)
so you can follow along. </p>
<p>To understand how dedicated to this trip I am, here are some examples of the
things that I’ve already paid for and am committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$913 – Year of traveler’s insurance</p></li>
<li><p>$1,300 – Volunteer in Costa Rica (see bottom of
page for reasons and my justification for paying to volunteer – I will be doing
volunteer work both that you pay for and that you don’t)</p></li>
<li><p>$1,325 – Flight from Costa Rica to S. Africa</p></li>
<li><p>$400 – Backpacker’s bus pass to take me across
s. Africa</p></li>
<li><p>$75 – Bungee jump at Bloukrans Bridge</p></li>
<li><p>$1,580 – Volunteer in S. Africa</p></li>
<li><p>$890 – 8 day safari from S. Africa, through
Botswana, to Zambia</p></li>
<li><p>$135 – New Year’s week in Goa, India</p></li>
<li><p>$650 – Immunizations (polio booster, tetanus,
typhoid, Hep A &amp; Hep B, malaria)</p></li>
</ul><p>While I have other plans after this, many places don’t take reservations
more than 6 months in advance and I will be solidifying those plans along the
way.</p>
<p>Perks range from me sending you a single postcard, to a few high quality
prints at the end of the trip, up to a visit from me after the trip with a
personal viewing of all my photos from the trip and the stories behind them! </p>
<p>I have purposely started this fundraiser so that it starts at almost the
same time as I am beginning this adventure. This way you have an opportunity to
view my travel blog with some of the initial photos and stories to give you
confidence in where my skills and determination will take me. I take no offense
to anyone that does not want to donate to my fundraiser, but I hope you check
out my blog, and share with you friends &amp; family! </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>While the majority of this trip is for my personal exploration, soul
searching, and working on my photography portfolio, I will also do my best to
be a responsible traveler and give back to the communities where I’m staying. I
will be doing things like volunteering with animal conservation programs,
working in gardens or wherever hosts may need help, and taking part in art
projects in small communities. I would love to share this experience with you!</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Long term travel, especially solo, can be very trying on a person. However,
I feel confident that instead of giving up, I will be able to overcome any
obstacles and keep a level head when things get tough. This is because starting
with college, I moved out of state where I knew not a single person and
absolutely loved it. I made friends and was able to figure out how to thrive in
a new environment. Then, a few years after college, I decided on a whim one day
to move out to Colorado. The only people I knew were friends of friends that I
had briefly met on a weekend trip out there. I stayed out there for over 5
years through a mix of good, bad, and ugly…. Ah, who am I kidding? Even at its
worst, Colorado is far from ugly. I’ve also done some smaller scale things solo
– weekend festivals, traveling up &amp; down the East Coast, including a
weekend trip once to NYC where I went to the wrong airport on the way home (I
will never again assume that because I flew into one airport on a roundtrip
ticket, that I will fly out of that same airport a few days later) – but
instead of losing my cool I calmly found my way to the bus station and figured
out how to get home, albeit a few hours later than planned. I find that while
many people are often scared of change, I thrive on it. I find that instead of
getting upset when one opportunity falls through, I get excited about what new
opportunities that opens me up to. </p>

<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>I understand that not everyone is interested in taking part in my adventure
and that is completely fine, no hard feelings for those of you that can’t or
don’t want to contribute. Whether you would like to contribute to my plans or
not, I still hope you check out my travel blog and sign up for updates! Don’t
forget to share with you friends! </p>
<p><b>Reasons to participate in paid volunteer programs</b></p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense when you first see or hear it, paying to volunteer,
especially when there are plenty of places you can volunteer without paying for
it. The reason I have chosen to participate in some of these programs is
because of the experience that they offer. Most often the programs that are
free to volunteer with are either funded by the government or a religious
entity (eg. the church), while animal conservation (where my interests lie)
often have no funding and need to find ways to cover all their expenses. The
programs that I am taking part in will, in exchange for my volunteer fees,
provide: food, lodging, transportation, training, and travel insurance (if
needed, I have my own to cover more time than just when there). These programs
take on the liability of everyone that wants the experience they offer, even if
that person has no special skills (like being a Vet) that they can specifically
offer the program. </p>
<p>For example, my first program is working with sea turtles in Costa Rica.
While much of the actual work is doing beach patrol cleaning up debris and
looking for sea turtle nests, the program also includes an intense week of
Spanish classes with options to also take dancing and cooking classes. I will
then get hands on experience of working with these beautiful animals while
living on the beach. While I have no special skills that are needed by the
program, I do hope to use my skills in photography to create compelling images
to bring more awareness to the plight of the sea turtle. </p>

offer the program. 
For example, my first program is working with sea turtles in Costa Rica.
While much of the actual work is doing beach patrol cleaning up debris and
looking for sea turtle nests, the program also includes an intense week of
Spanish classes with options to also take dancing and cooking classes. I will
then get hands on experience of working with these beautiful animals while
living on the beach. While I have no special skills that are needed by the
program, I do hope to use my skills in photography to create compelling images
to bring more awareness to the plight of the sea turtle.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We bring seven years of design and manufacturing experience to this project, and have a strong relationship with our manufacturing partners. We aim to make production and delivery as efficient as possible. We have finished prototypes of the Smart Solar Garden and are currently building additional revised prototypes for further testing of materials and specs. We have completed the Alpha testing version of our app, including all the lighting features. LuminAID has never developed an app before, so this has posed its own set of challenges; however, we have strong resources to help us and experienced developers dedicated to creating an efficient, user-friendly app. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Smart Solar Garden products need to be 100% waterproof. We're working hard to hone in on the manufacturing techniques needed to ensure durability and source the correct materials to use. We are 95% there and confident we can finalize all the details, but these are new manufacturing techniques and we need to work closely with our manufacturing partners to innovate these processes.</p>
<p>We successfully completed a crowdfunding campaign last year for the PackLite Max 2-in-1 Phone Charger, another innovative solar lantern. This project gave us experience in complex prototype testing, anticipating lead times, and customer support. We're applying our successes and challenges we learned about from previous campaign to make this one even better.</p>

The Shanren Discovery unit is a bit chunkier than a Garmin, but at 137g it’s not too bulky and it way outlasts Garmin’s maximum 15 to 20 hour battery life in its units. The screen is 6.8cm wide and displays 28 data fields. It’s controlled via three buttons on the top of the GPS.”</p><p>There’s a built-in 260 lumen front light to show you the way too, although this can be slid out of the unit and removed if you don’t want this feature.

This super compact bike computer not only leaves more room for the handlebars but also makes your ride easier and smarter. Di-Pro gives you an unprecedented riding experience. Di-Pro: Meet all your needs!“Cycling GPS units have a habit of dying if you’re doing much more than the usual Sunday morning run, back for lunch. But the new Shanren Discovery GPS has a claimed battery life of 96，so you should be able to take on multi-day rides without needing to recharge.You’d expect a GPS with that sort of battery life to be a monster. The Shanren Discovery unit is a bit chunkier than a Garmin, but at 137g it’s not too bulky and it way outlasts Garmin’s maximum 15 to 20 hour battery life in its units. The screen is 6.8cm wide and displays 28 data fields. It’s controlled via three buttons on the top of the GPS.”There’s a built-in 260 lumen front light to show you the way too, although this can be slid out of the unit and removed if you don’t want this feature. Plus the front of the unit includes a set of LEDs that can be configured to change colour at threshold speeds.Why is Di-Pro So Powerful? 28 Data Display2.7-inch intuitive screen with 28 data display, Di-Pro presents pretty much everything you need no matter for casual or professional cycling sport.Virtual Power​Have you ever thought of getting a consistent power reading on the road and on the trainer WITHOUT a power meter?
