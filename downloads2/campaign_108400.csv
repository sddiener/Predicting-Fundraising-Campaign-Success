<h3>The Campaign </h3>
<p>     This campaign was created to promote happiness all throughout the world in an attempt to do its part to combat depression. Happiness can be somewhat of an elusive thing. After all is said and done, it is truly what we seek more than the self-gratifying things of the world such as money, fame, or earthly achievements. Those things will give us momentary happiness, but it is the type of happiness that fades rapidly.</p>
<p><br/>     Studies show that money does not buy happiness, nor does status, and neither a wall full of trophies or accomplishments. So, where is this elusive happiness, and how do we obtain it? That’s the question all of us ask but few can answer. But don’t let happiness slip between your fingers. Choose today to start your personal path to happiness. </p>
<p><br/>     We here at the Choose Happy campaign believe that happiness is a choice. It can be inspired and preserved through tradition and the sharing and hearing of stories as a way to gain inspiration in this seemingly dark and gloomy world. We are traveling the world promoting happiness, sharing stories, and meeting as many people as we can as to share their stories with you. We personally have experienced the power of happiness through the sharing of stories, and that is why we desire to find those willing to share so that we can be the medium to share with the rest of the world. You deserve to be happy! Choose today to be happy!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     We are doing this fundraiser so that we can get this movement started. In our world today where billions of videos are watched and shared daily. Not millions, but billions. We understand that video marketing plays such an important role in getting the word out to the people. We need your help to get the equipment needed to start recording the amazing stories so that they can be shared with the world. The need for our cause is great, and we are trying to do everything we can to help all those around us to choose happy and spread joy throughout the world. </p>
<p>     Most importantly we need your support for the cause! Simply, we know together we can make a difference. But this will only work if we come together and work as a team. We are counting on you to come lend a hand. Do your part to help those in need. Everyone in one way or another has been effected by depression, here is your chance to stand up against it, shoulder to shoulder with others who are in the same fight. The fight choosing happiness! Choose happy and join our cause. When you do you will get that warm feeling inside when you do what is right, you will be and feel part of the team, and you will be another voice added to the whole in this fight.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     Happiness is contagious and like a smile it can make a huge difference with a ripple effect reaching out and helping more people than you can imagine. We plan to make this campaign big. Bigger than just us as individuals. We want to spread this feeling of happiness to all corners of the world. To the people who are stuck in the grips of depression, and those who are just having a rough day. This campaign is here to help you, and everyone you know and love. We want to bring the world together as a family, and create a community where positive energy and stories can be shared. By helping to fund this campaign, you're not just helping those with depression, you're helping create a community that will battle depression and sadness at its very roots.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>     350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. That is 5% of the world's population. Up to 15% of those diagnosed with depression die by suicide. There are so many all around us suffering today.  At We Choose Happy, we do not aspire to eradicate depression, but to alleviate it. Our stories focus on those who have battled depression and found a better way of living. Some have lost close friends to this disease. We hope to bring some joy through our books and stories, a new perspective, to shed some light on this issue. We hope to bring our story to countries affected the most by depression such as China, the U.S., Tonga, and African nations. Reducing stigma can not only lead to a better informed public, but it can also save lives.</p>

<p>Dillon and Sheyanne Petrovich, </p>
<p>    We are both students here studying at Brigham Young University Hawaii. I, Dillon, am majoring in  International Cultural Studies with an emphasis on Peace-building I am also get a certificate in Legal Studies and a minor in Spanish. My wife is Majoring in Social Work and TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and minoring in Spanish as well. We both served 2 year service missions for our church. I served on the East Coast of the U.S. in the state of South Carolina, and my wife served in the capitol of Argentina in the city of Buenos Aires. </p>
<p>     The inspiration to start this campaign came while we were living abroad in mainland China. We met so many wonderful people living in very poor circumstances. We saw extreme poverty and situations which made us wonder why all these people we met were still so happy. We wanted to know so we started to interview all those we met who were happy and asked what made them happy. We found that happiness was a choice that they were all making and they were not letting their environment or circumstances dictate their choice to be happy. We Choose Happy is our way to reach those who need help, we are doing our part to help them out! </p>

<p>Amanda Lyzwinski,</p>
<p>    I also went through my own journey to chose happiness. As I found the Choose Happy way of life, I have seen my motivation increase, my comfort zone has been obliterated, and I have had more joy in living than ever before. In this project I bring my expertise in Finance and Accounting. As an Accounting and Math major here at Brigham Young University Hawaii, I have worked in finance and business technology for more than 3 years. When approached by the team at We Choose Happy I was more than willing to join, I knew that this was a worthy cause and dedicated my time to do whatever was needed to support. </p>

<p>Kyler Peek, </p>
<p>     I am a current student attending Brigham Young University Hawaii majoring in Business. While I lived in a foreign country for 2 years serving a faith mission for my church, my experiences in Peru made me realize how much poverty and unhappiness there is in the world. This is why I have joined and am dedicated to the We Choose Happy movement to spread happiness and joy to those around us. With my extensive knowledge of business I have used what i have learned throughout my time to help We Choose Happy overcome the obstacles that  we have experienced as our efforts to further the cause to fight depression. </p>

Se puede inspirar y preservar a través de la tradición y el intercambio y el oído de historias como una forma de obtener inspiración en este mundo oscuro y sombrío. Estamos viajando por el mundo promoviendo la felicidad, compartiendo historias y conociendo a tantas personas como podamos para compartir sus historias con ustedes.

<p>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</p>
<p>      Estamos haciendo esta recaudación de fondos para que podamos comenzar este movimiento. En nuestro mundo de hoy, donde miles de millones de videos son vistos y compartidos diariamente. No millones, sino miles de millones. Entendemos que el video marketing es tan importante para hacer correr la voz a la gente. Necesitamos su ayuda para obtener el equipo necesario para comenzar a registrar las historias increíbles para que puedan ser compartidas con el mundo. La necesidad de nuestra causa es grandiosa, y estamos tratando de hacer todo lo que podamos para ayudar a todos los que nos rodean a elegir alegría feliz y difundida en todo el mundo.</p>
<p>      ¡Lo más importante es que necesitamos tu apoyo para la causa! Simplemente, sabemos que juntos podemos hacer la diferencia. Pero esto solo funcionará si nos juntamos y trabajamos en equipo. Estamos contando contigo para que ayudes. Haga su parte para ayudar a los que necesitan. Todos de una forma u otra han sido afectados por la depresión, aquí está tu oportunidad de enfrentarte a ella, hombro a hombro con otros que están en la misma lucha. ¡La lucha eligiendo la felicidad! Elija feliz y únase a nuestra causa. Cuando lo haga, sentirá esa sensación cálida en su interior cuando haga lo correcto, será y se sentirá parte del equipo, y será otra voz agregada al todo en esta lucha.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>El impacto</p>
<p>     La felicidad es contagiosa y, como una sonrisa, puede marcar una gran diferencia con un efecto de onda expansiva que ayuda a más personas de las que puedes imaginar. Planeamos hacer esta campaña grande. Más grande que solo nosotros como individuos. Queremos difundir este sentimiento de felicidad en todos los rincones del mundo. Para las personas que están atrapadas en los apretones de la depresión, y aquellos que están teniendo un día difícil. Esta campaña está aquí para ayudarlo, y a todos los que conoce y ama. Queremos unir al mundo como una familia, y crear una comunidad donde la energía positiva y las historias se puedan compartir. Al ayudar a financiar esta campaña, no solo ayuda a las personas con depresión, sino que ayuda a crear una comunidad que luchará contra la depresión y la tristeza juntos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dillon y Sheyanne Petrovich,</p>
<p>    Los dos estamos estudiando aquí en la Universidad de Brigham Young Hawái. Yo, Dillon, estoy especializándome en los Estudios Culturales Internacionales con énfasis en la construcción de la paz. También recibiendo un certificado en los Estudios Legales y una especialización en español. Mi esposa se especializa en Trabajo Social y TESOL (Enseñanza de Inglés para Hablantes de Otros Idiomas) y también habla y estudia el español. Ambos servimos misiones de servicio de 2 años para nuestra iglesia. Serví en la costa este de los EE. UU. en el estado de Carolina del Sur (South Carolina), y mi esposa sirvió en la capital de Argentina, en la ciudad de Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>     La inspiración para comenzar esta campaña vino mientras estábamos viviendo en China continental. Conocimos a tantas personas maravillosas que vivían en circunstancias muy pobres. Vimos pobreza extrema y situaciones que nos hicieron preguntarnos por qué todas estas personas que conocimos todavía estaban tan felices. Queríamos saberlo, así que comenzamos a entrevistar a todos los que conocimos que estaban felices y les preguntamos qué los hacía felices. Descubrimos que la felicidad era una decisión que todos ellos estaban haciendo y que no estaban dejando que su entorno o sus circunstancias dictaminaran su decisión de ser felices. “We Choose Happy” es nuestra forma de llegar a aquellos que necesitan ayuda, ¡estamos haciendo nuestra parte para ayudarlos!</p>
<p>Jackson,</p>
<p>      Estoy esdudiando comunicaciones aquí en el Universidad de BYU-Hawaii. Personalmente, he visto que la depresión afecta profundamente a las personas que me rodean y esto me ha motivado a buscar lo que hace felices a la gente. Cuando me puse en contacto con We Choose Happy, no dudé en ofrecer mi ayuda y unirme a la causa. Con mi experiencia en Humanidades y Comunicaciones, he trabajado muy cerca con el departamento de Redes Sociales del equipo para ayudar a difundir el mensaje, de modo que nuestro movimiento pueda comenzar a generar grandes olas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kyler,</p>
<p>    Soy un estudiante actual que asiste a la Universidad Brigham Young de Hawaii especializándome en Negocios. Mientras viví en un país extranjero durante 2 años sirviendo en una misión de fe para mi iglesia, mis experiencias en Perú me hicieron darme cuenta de la pobreza y la infelicidad que hay en el mundo. Es por eso que me uní al movimiento We Choose Happy y nos dedicamos a difundir felicidad y alegría entre quienes nos rodean. Con mi amplio conocimiento de los negocios, he utilizado lo que he aprendido a lo largo de mi tiempo para ayudar a We Choose Happy a superar los obstáculos que hemos experimentado en nuestros esfuerzos por promover la causa de la depresión.</p>
<p>Amanda Lyzwinski,</p>
<p>      También he realizado mi propio viaje para elegir la felicidad. Al encontrar la forma de vida de “Choose Happy”, he visto aumentar mi motivación, mi zona de comodidad se ha borrado y he disfrutado más de la vida que nunca. En este proyecto, aporto mi experiencia en Finanzas y Contabilidad. Como estudiante de Contabilidad y Matemáticas aquí en la Universidad Brigham Young Hawái, he trabajado en finanzas y tecnología empresarial por más de 3 años. Cuando se nos acercó el equipo de “We Choose Happy”, estaba más que dispuesto a unirme, sabía que esta era una buena causa y dediqué mi tiempo a hacer lo que fuera necesario para apoyar.</p>

No millones, sino miles de millones. Entendemos que el video marketing es tan importante para hacer correr la voz a la gente. Necesitamos su ayuda para obtener el equipo necesario para comenzar a registrar las historias increíbles para que puedan ser compartidas con el mundo. La necesidad de nuestra causa es grandiosa, y estamos tratando de hacer todo lo que podamos para ayudar a todos los que nos rodean a elegir alegría feliz y difundida en todo el mundo.
      ¡Lo más importante es que necesitamos tu apoyo para la causa! Simplemente, sabemos que juntos podemos hacer la diferencia. Pero esto solo funcionará si nos juntamos y trabajamos en equipo. Estamos contando contigo para que ayudes. Haga su parte para ayudar a los que necesitan. Todos de una forma u otra han sido afectados por la depresión, aquí está tu oportunidad de enfrentarte a ella, hombro a hombro con otros que están en la misma lucha. ¡La lucha eligiendo la felicidad! Elija feliz y únase a nuestra causa. Cuando lo haga, sentirá esa sensación cálida en su interior cuando haga lo correcto, será y se sentirá parte del equipo, y será otra voz agregada al todo en esta lucha.
 
El impacto
     La felicidad es contagiosa y, como una sonrisa, puede marcar una gran diferencia con un efecto de onda expansiva que ayuda a más personas de las que puedes imaginar. Planeamos hacer esta campaña grande. Más grande que solo nosotros como individuos. Queremos difundir este sentimiento de felicidad en todos los rincones del mundo. Para las personas que están atrapadas en los apretones de la depresión, y aquellos que están teniendo un día difícil. Esta campaña está aquí para ayudarlo, y a todos los que conoce y ama. Queremos unir al mundo como una familia, y crear una comunidad donde la energía positiva y las historias se puedan compartir. Al ayudar a financiar esta campaña, no solo ayuda a las personas con depresión, sino que ayuda a crear una comunidad que luchará contra la depresión y la tristeza juntos.
 
Dillon y Sheyanne Petrovich,
    Los dos estamos estudiando aquí en la Universidad de Brigham Young Hawái. Yo, Dillon, estoy especializándome en los Estudios Culturales Internacionales con énfasis en la construcción de la paz. También recibiendo un certificado en los Estudios Legales y una especialización en español. Mi esposa se especializa en Trabajo Social y TESOL (Enseñanza de Inglés para Hablantes de Otros Idiomas) y también habla y estudia el español. Ambos servimos misiones de servicio de 2 años para nuestra iglesia. Serví en la costa este de los EE. UU. en el estado de Carolina del Sur (South Carolina), y mi esposa sirvió en la capital de Argentina, en la ciudad de Buenos Aires.
     La inspiración para comenzar esta campaña vino mientras estábamos viviendo en China continental. Conocimos a tantas personas maravillosas que vivían en circunstancias muy pobres. Vimos pobreza extrema y situaciones que nos hicieron preguntarnos por qué todas estas personas que conocimos todavía estaban tan felices. Queríamos saberlo, así que comenzamos a entrevistar a todos los que conocimos que estaban felices y les preguntamos qué los hacía felices. Descubrimos que la felicidad era una decisión que todos ellos estaban haciendo y que no estaban dejando que su entorno o sus circunstancias dictaminaran su decisión de ser felices. “We Choose Happy” es nuestra forma de llegar a aquellos que necesitan ayuda, ¡estamos haciendo nuestra parte para ayudarlos!
Jackson,
      Estoy esdudiando comunicaciones aquí en el Universidad de BYU-Hawaii. Personalmente, he visto que la depresión afecta profundamente a las personas que me rodean y esto me ha motivado a buscar lo que hace felices a la gente. Cuando me puse en contacto con We Choose Happy, no dudé en ofrecer mi ayuda y unirme a la causa. Con mi experiencia en Humanidades y Comunicaciones, he trabajado muy cerca con el departamento de Redes Sociales del equipo para ayudar a difundir el mensaje, de modo que nuestro movimiento pueda comenzar a generar grandes olas.
 
Kyler,
    Soy un estudiante actual que asiste a la Universidad Brigham Young de Hawaii especializándome en Negocios. Mientras viví en un país extranjero durante 2 años sirviendo en una misión de fe para mi iglesia, mis experiencias en Perú me hicieron darme cuenta de la pobreza y la infelicidad que hay en el mundo. Es por eso que me uní al movimiento We Choose Happy y nos dedicamos a difundir felicidad y alegría entre quienes nos rodean. Con mi amplio conocimiento de los negocios, he utilizado lo que he aprendido a lo largo de mi tiempo para ayudar a We Choose Happy a superar los obstáculos que hemos experimentado en nuestros esfuerzos por promover la causa de la depresión.
Amanda Lyzwinski,
      También he realizado mi propio viaje para elegir la felicidad. Al encontrar la forma de vida de “Choose Happy”, he visto aumentar mi motivación, mi zona de comodidad se ha borrado y he disfrutado más de la vida que nunca. En este proyecto, aporto mi experiencia en Finanzas y Contabilidad. Como estudiante de Contabilidad y Matemáticas aquí en la Universidad Brigham Young Hawái, he trabajado en finanzas y tecnología empresarial por más de 3 años. Cuando se nos acercó el equipo de “We Choose Happy”, estaba más que dispuesto a unirme, sabía que esta era una buena causa y dediqué mi tiempo a hacer lo que fuera necesario para apoyar.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are seeking your help to heal our fellow citizens of Botswana, as well as members of our global village. Our country has long suffered one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS in the world.  While 27 new infections per day is a shocking number, what is not reported is the stress of living with the disease as well as the strain placed upon family members and caregivers. Instead of a medical response however, we seek to heal the psychological wounds inflicted upon our local and global populations.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi!  I'm Dr. Didi Sekoko-Biorn, a clinical psychologist trained in the US, and now practicing in my home country Botswana.  As a former fellow of the <a href=""http://www.usd.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/dmhi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Disaster Mental Health Institute (DMHI)</a>, my experiences in conducting therapy throughout the years have led me to the understanding that we are all collectively hurting or recovering from various levels of trauma. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Feeling like my years of conducting therapy were analogous to ""putting out fires"", I teamed up with my lifetime sister-friend and mindfulness coach, Mother K Masire, to create a sustainable, eco-friendly retreat camp in the African bush through our organization, AfroBotho. We seek to bring groups of people together and serve as a place to heal from the pressures of the modern world. </p>

<p>After securing 40 acres of beautiful, untouched land just a 15-minute drive from Botswana's tourism capital of Maun, (gateway to the UNESCO world heritage site, the Okavango Delta), we felt so strongly about our idea that we both sold our family homes to fund the construction.</p>

<p>As a fledgling democracy in 1976, ten years after its independence and one of the poorest countries in Africa at the time, our government appealed to its citizens to donate whatever they could to help build our first University.

<h3><strong>About us and our Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Innisfree Farm and Botanic Garden is a 7 acre property on Vancouver Island.  It is home to the only registered botanic garden in British Columbia that specializes in medicinal plants and herbs, as well as a not-for-profit society, Gardens without Borders, that delivers horticulture therapy programs to disadvantaged and disabled individuals. The gardens were founded by Chanchal Cabrera and Thierry Vrain in 2003.</p>
<p>At Innisfree we grow culinary herbs, medicinal plants, vegetables, and berries and offer cooking and gardening classes, herbal medicine workshops, and nature therapy programs.  On Fridays and Saturdays throughout the summer we open our gates to the public so they can explore the farm. We host a small cafe featuring al fresco breakfast, lunch, and tea items and a market stand offering fresh vegetables, and a range of health and wellness products handmade at the farm.  We also host special events and have a Yurt for guests who wish to plan overnight visits.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524417158/zffdpv3c1jdjmsv8pvji.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>We started Innisfree Farm and Botanic Garden as a refuge for people to escape to, away from their busy and hectic lives. We create opportunities for people to connect with nature and food in intimate ways - where healing and wellness begin with how we nourish our bodies and souls.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Help us Grow Innisfree Farm and Botanic Garden into a Premier Wellness Destination in Western Canada</h3>
<p>We need $100,000 for a series of updates on the farm as well as to jump-start a series of revenue-generating activities to support our work. We dream of having a farm that is available and accessible to as many people as possible - to teach about medicinal plants and herbs, to use nature to heal physical and emotional pain. And this is why we’re asking for your support. Building a dream takes time and resources, much like growing a garden.</p>
<p>The projects we’ll be able to complete with $100,000 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the new front fence and gates at the entrance to the gardens</li>
<li>Pave paths from the street and through the gardens for improved access for all users</li>
<li>Install accessible bathrooms</li>
<li>Create service counter with sink and fridge for outdoor cafe service<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> area</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Landscape cafe area with</span> retaining wall, hedge, pond, and flagstone</li>
<li>Build a recreational area for children with natural materials</li>
<li>Install benches, waste receptacles, information boards, maps and directional signs<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span>
</li>
<li><p>Install bike racks</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With funding to support these very important projects we’ll be in a better position to:</p>
<ul>
<li>share our farm and programming with more guests;</li>
<li>establish Innisfree as a premier destination in Western Canada to experience, learn, and benefit from natural medicine and connections with nature;</li>
<li>generate more revenue to reinvest into our horticulture therapy and nature  programs;</li>
<li>create healthier people through meaningful connections with food and nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve already invested incredible quantities of our resources into this farm but to fulfill our dream we need your help.</p>

She gained her MSc in herbal medicine at the University of Wales in 2003 and she held the faculty chair in Botanical Medicine at the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine in New Westminster  from 2004 – 2016. She holds diplomas in Botanic Garden Management and in Botanic Garden Education from Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in Shinrin Yoku (forest bathing) and is a certified Master Gardener and a certified Horticulture Therapist</p>
<p>Chanchal runs a private herbal medicine clinic with a specialty in holistic oncology and offers a monthly student training clinic that provides free health services to the community. The farm also hosts Gardens without Borders, a federally registered not-for-profit society established to run the botanic garden and provide horticulture therapy. </p>
<p>Thierry was born and raised in Paris. He completed his undergraduate studies in Caen in Normandie and he then moved to Montréal to teach plant physiology. Thierry completed his graduate studies in Raleigh, North Carolina, and worked for 30 years doing research for the Canadian Department of Agriculture.   Thierry retired 16 years ago and for 7 years he ran a successful CSA (community supported agriculture) program at Innisfree, growing food for 20 households. For the last 6 years he has been lecturing extensively across Canada and USA about the chemical contamination of foods through commercial agriculture practices.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the rush? Why do you need $100,000 right now? </strong></p>
<p>We have some urgency because we have been building up to this for a while, gathering momentum, learning and figuring out how to do this whole project of a botanic garden.  Now we are ready.</p>
<p>We have to do the front fence and gates immediately because the old wood one that served us for 10 years has finally fallen down. While replacing the fence we have the opportunity to move equipment onto the land for building our cafe space. And with improved facilities, we want to accommodate as many guests as possible - but grass is far less friendly than paved paths for strollers and wheelchairs.  So flagstone, landscaping, and paving will improve conditions.  Costs for these improvements add up quickly !</p>
<p><strong>How do you know $100,000 will be enough to complete your desired projects?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve done our best to estimate the costs associated with the projects we want to complete.  We have plans drafted and contractors waiting on hold to help us put them into motion. While we understand that there are unforeseen costs associated with almost every project, we are hopeful that our plans are inclusive and cost-effective.</p>
<p>If we don't raise all the funds we've made a budget for priority projects and will work to complete what we are able to with the funds we raise. </p>
<p><a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524420569/bv3xgmgpimrktfb7ekbb.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524420108/edkhrl70i4jxeggn0puf.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p><strong>What will you do if you don’t raise $100,000?</strong></p>
<p>If we are unsuccessful in raising $100,000 we will work to complete the projects that we have listed based on priority. We’ve chosen a flexible campaign on Indiegogo so we will have access to the funds we raise even if we do not raise the whole $100,000.   </p>
<p>We have planned some realistic compromises - for example, we have to do the fence and we have no choice, but we can, if we have too, grass the terrace instead of flagstones. It is not as durable and not as smooth for wheelchairs, but it still works.</p>
<p>With that being said, we understand that $100,000 is a big goal but we also feel we have a compelling cause and we’re very motivated to achieve our goal. We have so much of the Botanic Garden infrastructure and critical mass in place, and this construction project is the last piece required to make the garden really work.</p>
<p><strong>When will the projects be completed?</strong></p>
<p>The fence and gates will be completed in May 2018. The cafe, terrace, and landscaping will happen very shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Have you looked for funds elsewhere?</strong></p>
<p>So far, most of the investment in the land has come from us as the owners. Draining, ditching, soil building, planting trees and making herb gardens, deer fencing and so on has been our investment over 12 years.</p>
<p>Chanchal went to school in London for 10 weeks in 2013, at her own expense, to study at Kew Gardens and get a diploma in Botanic Garden management. The following year, 2014, she got a $6600 grant from the Alan Lennox Boyd Memorial Trust in UK, to attend a 6-week program in Botanic Garden Education (teaching science in a garden).</p>
<p>We have done over $10,000 of fund  raising in the past through events and dinners at the farm, and we have received almost $5000 of donations from private donors.</p>

<p><strong>What is a botanic garden?</strong></p>
<p>A botanic garden is an establishment where plants are grown for scientific study and display to the public. Innisfree Botanic Garden specializes in medicinal plants and our demonstration garden is organized based on different organs in the body. We also have a collection of sacred and medicinal trees.

Its mission is to provide healing opportunities through plants and gardening (Horticulture Therapy). Horticulture Therapy (HT) uses plants and the natural world to facilitate participants in achieving specific and measurable goals in the domains of overall personal well being: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, vocational, and creative health.  Currently, Gardens without Borders operates only within the growing season at Innisfree Farm, but the intention is to make it available year-round with more funding.</p>
<p><strong>What programs are offered to the public at Innisfree?</strong></p>
<p>We offer a number of programs that are open to the public at Innisfree.

</div></div>","About us and our Vision
Innisfree Farm and Botanic Garden is a 7 acre property on Vancouver Island.  It is home to the only registered botanic garden in British Columbia that specializes in medicinal plants and herbs, as well as a not-for-profit society, Gardens without Borders, that delivers horticulture therapy programs to disadvantaged and disabled individuals. The gardens were founded by Chanchal Cabrera and Thierry Vrain in 2003.
At Innisfree we grow culinary herbs, medicinal plants, vegetables, and berries and offer cooking and gardening classes, herbal medicine workshops, and nature therapy programs.  On Fridays and Saturdays throughout the summer we open our gates to the public so they can explore the farm. We host a small cafe featuring al fresco breakfast, lunch, and tea items and a market stand offering fresh vegetables, and a range of health and wellness products handmade at the farm.  We also host special events and have a Yurt for guests who wish to plan overnight visits.


We started Innisfree Farm and Botanic Garden as a refuge for people to escape to, away from their busy and hectic lives. We create opportunities for people to connect with nature and food in intimate ways - where healing and wellness begin with how we nourish our bodies and souls.  
 
Help us Grow Innisfree Farm and Botanic Garden into a Premier Wellness Destination in Western Canada
We need $100,000 for a series of updates on the farm as well as to jump-start a series of revenue-generating activities to support our work. We dream of having a farm that is available and accessible to as many people as possible - to teach about medicinal plants and herbs, to use nature to heal physical and emotional pain. And this is why we’re asking for your support. Building a dream takes time and resources, much like growing a garden.
The projects we’ll be able to complete with $100,000 are:

Build the new front fence and gates at the entrance to the gardens
Pave paths from the street and through the gardens for improved access for all users
Install accessible bathrooms
Create service counter with sink and fridge for outdoor cafe service area


Landscape cafe area with retaining wall, hedge, pond, and flagstone
Build a recreational area for children with natural materials
Install benches, waste receptacles, information boards, maps and directional signs 

Install bike racks

With funding to support these very important projects we’ll be in a better position to:

share our farm and programming with more guests;
establish Innisfree as a premier destination in Western Canada to experience, learn, and benefit from natural medicine and connections with nature;
generate more revenue to reinvest into our horticulture therapy and nature  programs;
create healthier people through meaningful connections with food and nature.

We’ve already invested incredible quantities of our resources into this farm but to fulfill our dream we need your help.

 
How You Can Help
We hope you'll help us make our dream come true. Your support will not go unnoticed no matter the size of your contribution. We’ve curated a variety of ways that we can express our thanks to you. Please check out all of our perks - from samples of the products we create and sell at Innisfree to eco-therapy immersions or sponsoring trees on the property, we have something for everyone!
And if you can’t contribute financially we would be so grateful if you could share this video with your family, friends, colleagues and on social media.  Any and all support that you can show to our campaign is truly invaluable to us.  Use the Indiegogo share tools! They make sharing super easy!
Thank you, from the bottoms of our muddy farm boots to the tips of our Douglas Firs.

Do you have more questions? We might have some answers! Here are some Frequently Asked Questions.
Who runs and manages Innisfree Farm and Botanic Garden?

We are launching earlier than scheduled in May 2020 to encompass the massive support needed during the current pandemic.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li>City Cakes has been around since 2007 specializing in notable baked goods, from stunning custom cakes to innovative gourmet products, and notably is the Original Home of the Half Pound Cookie, shipping across the US.</li>
<li>Our platform gives us a unique ability to call attention to important issues faced, and embraced, by the City Cakes’ community. We have an outlet to raise funds and provide charitable, “sweet” relief to those in need. </li>
<li>In this sad and unprecedented time, first responders and essential workers have selflessly stepped up in hopes of saving lives and keeping people healthy. They need as much mental and physical sustenance as we can bring to the table, so we are shifting resources to not only receive donations to provide to them, but also to take specific requests on who/where in the USA our support is needed.</li>

</div><p> </p></div>","Introducing City Cakes CARES
City Cakes CARES, a division of City Cakes’ New York based operation, captures different forms of philanthropic work through donations, product sales, and outreach. We are launching earlier than scheduled in May 2020 to encompass the massive support needed during the current pandemic.

City Cakes has been around since 2007 specializing in notable baked goods, from stunning custom cakes to innovative gourmet products, and notably is the Original Home of the Half Pound Cookie, shipping across the US.
Our platform gives us a unique ability to call attention to important issues faced, and embraced, by the City Cakes’ community. We have an outlet to raise funds and provide charitable, “sweet” relief to those in need. 
In this sad and unprecedented time, first responders and essential workers have selflessly stepped up in hopes of saving lives and keeping people healthy. They need as much mental and physical sustenance as we can bring to the table, so we are shifting resources to not only receive donations to provide to them, but also to take specific requests on who/where in the USA our support is needed.

 

How Can YOU Help City Cakes CARES?
City Cakes CARES' Covid-19 relief is a bit different because we have the ability to deliver and ship products not only across the NYC area, but across the country. 

By making a donation, you will directly provide our incredible treats to first responders, essential workers or needing families of victims of Covid-19. Your donation can even match a specific Donation Request to recipient/s of your choice.
For each donation level, there are perks for you to share in the City Cakes CARES spirit during this time. We know the physical and emotional toll this pandemic is having on just about everyone, and thank you for your donation with City Cakes credit and awesome City Cakes CARES merch (also available for purchase).

 

The Impact
We are setting a goal of $30K which may seem like a lot, but it isn't. The amount of product we can create for that amount won't even begin to make a dent in what is needed, but any amount counts. 30K will convert to roughly 1.5 TONS of treats donated! 

City Cakes has been doing community and charity work for over 10 years, raising significant funds for groups in need, donating hundreds of pounds of products and raising immeasurable awareness for causes and groups including NYC Anti-Violence, Wildlife Warriors, World Central Kitchen, National Breast Cancer Foundation, Puerto Rican Relief and more. It has come time for us to unify our efforts under a dedicated resource in City Cakes CARES.
By creating an identity behind the charitable efforts that our customers and friends support and believe in, we can also include the community that means so much to us. We want to share and continue to be a driver in awareness and are all about the act of putting money where ones' mouth is!

 

What Stands in our Way?

Since we know we aren't bound by geography outside of the US, and our treats are unique and already being purchased as paid gifts for the groups we are looking to donate to, we know this program is going to be successful, but we will certainly have capacity restraints.
We will dedicate Tuesdays and Thursdays to completely fulfill City Cakes CARES donations and requests. We will reach limits on donation requests we can fulfill each week, but know that in 8 weeks we will be able to fulfill 30K worth of donations, and likely be able to continue beyond that.

 

How Else Can You Help?
If you can't make a donation today, we are also selling specific City Cakes CARES merchandise that will also benefit getting goods to those that need them! Check out the merchandise on CityCakes.com.
By shipping cookies to yourself or others on our site, or shopping at our contactless location in NYC, you are helping to keep our team running at City Cakes! That in itself allows us to keep doing what we're doing ,and provides for the team and the resources needed to make City Cakes CARES function.

<p>We are students at The University of Tennessee and we are wanting to raise money for The Dream Connection, a non-profit organization here in East Tennessee, that raises money for children with life-threatening illnesses to provide them with a dream of their choice.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Charlotte Spaulding ""Charlie"" is a 6-year-old girl who has been fighting Acute Leukemia for 2 years. Acute Leukemia is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects white blood cells. The Dream Connection is raising money for Charlie to go to Disney World and have the Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boutique experience! The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique is a magical beauty salon at the Magic Kingdom where little girls can get princess makeovers. Charlie wants to get a makeover like Belle from Beauty and the Beast. She told us they also have a swimming pool and all you can eat ice cream. She is super excited about that!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we got to meet Charlie we learned so much about her. She has a little sister (Emma) and a big sister (Caitlin). Charlie's favorite color is yellow. She LOVES Batman! All the things she wants for Christmas are Batman related. She told us when she gets older she wants to be a firefighter, an artist, and an oncology nurse.</p>

<p> If you can't make a donation then simply sharing the link to get the word out will help us out! Thank you so much for your help making Charlie's wish come true!!</p>

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>The birth center will be run by Lindsay Kinman, (LDM) a licensed Oregon midwife. Lindsay is a sharp, thoughtful, empathic provider who facilitates safe loving passages for birthing women, babies, and their families. Lindsay is a wife and mother of three who persisted for her dream through years as a nursing assistant, empowering families as a doula, obtaining a bachelors of science in midwifery, and ultimately offering full maternity care as a trusted and experienced midwife. She has supported the birth process in hospitals, in homes, and in freestanding birth centers. Her goal, and her heart, in every encounter, has been for women to find the power they have within to bring their children into the world and for the process to leave them whole and well. Mothers she has cared for will attest to her sound judgment, joyful presence, and unwavering support throughout the birth process and beyond. </p>
<p>The long-term vision for the Believing in Birth Wellness Center includes the opportunity for women to receive whole-person care in one setting with services such as nutrition classes, counseling, and obstetrics, in a model that emphasizes wholeness and wellbeing. The startup you will be supporting will get the central freestanding birth center up and running.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>How Much Do We Need?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $250,000. This will cover construction and renovation, provide 6 months of operating capital, and $25,000 for set up (office supplies, computers, gynecological tables, etc.)</li>
<li>Perks include Ruby Rain Organics gift boxes, T-shirts, free advertising and web site promotion, and more!</li>
<li>We have chosen flexible funding which means that we will take what we earn to start the process of getting the center up and running. Every penny counts!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>What do your contributions mean?</strong></h2>
<p>-Your contributions will allow Believing in Birth to offer the unique kind of care that is available in a freestanding birth center- in a setting that is directly across the street from a hospital but unencumbered by hospital schedules.</p>
<p>-Your contributions will turn the concerns of women who cannot afford the kind of care they seek into the excitement and relief of a family who finds an organization that will not turn them away.</p>
<p>-Your contributions will affirm that there is a safe place for those seeking birth experiences with the utilization of interventions only when sufficient evidence suggests it would be efficacious.</p>
<p>-Your contributions will ensure that women and their families have the full extent of birthways available, which research has proven necessary for meeting the wide variety of needs that women bring to such a demanding, powerful, and transformative time as birth.</p>
<p>-Your contribution allows us to provide maternity care, information, and support to ensure the wellbeing of all women in our community and beyond.</p>
<h2><b>The Impact</b></h2>
<p>What would happen to the mothers and babies in our area if one community used all of the tools at its disposal to support and care for them? What would happen to families if they felt in control of their birth process? What would happen if we limited trauma and unnecessary interventions? What would it look like if access to such care was not based on insurance or ability to pay?</p>
<p>We believe that your ongoing support will allow Believing in Birth to provide tangible answers to these questions in such a way as to offer a hopeful and healing path forward, building resilient families one birth at a time. We are certain that Believing in Birth Wellness Center is the initial brick in an intricate and grassroots-led path of whole-woman care.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Non-profits often suffer common pitfalls, and we are working hard to wrestle with the kinds of barriers that can be expected. For instance, to ensure that we are not duplicating services, but instead meeting unique and unmet needs, Lindsay is already networking with established obstetricians and midwives in the area.</p>
<p>The birth center has a unique advantage in its setting. Rather than purchasing, building, or completely renovating, Believing in Birth will lease a building that already meets stringent codes and standards. Thus funding will allow a remodel in order to create two birthing rooms and otherwise will utilize already existing spaces for services such as clinic, counseling, and birth education.</p>
<p>We realize that after initial startups, non-profits often fail or limp along due to inadequate attention to ongoing fundraising. Believing in Birth will persist in creating and maintaining donor databases, record-keeping, and relationships that foster thriving organizations. The center already has multiple dedicated volunteers who believe whole-heartedly in the cause.</p>
<p>Our board, although in its infancy, consists of business professionals who have extensive experience in both for-profit and nonprofit realms. They are actively assisting in the planning and development of this birth center in hope to overcome challenges that inhibit other nonprofits.</p>
<p>Finally, Believing in Birth recognizes the risk of losing a personal connection to donors as the list of donors grows. We commit ourselves to the grateful and graceful attempt to keep our donors informed, connected, and appreciated as we grow.</p>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Launching the Believing in Birth Wellness Center in Silverton, OR has been Lindsay’s dream for many years. She has inspired confidence in others to jump on board because it’s based on the belief that we as a community can gather around and support all women- putting aside bias and fear. We want to provide whole-woman care that betters the community, but we need your help to make it a reality!</p>
<p>Can’t donate financially? There are other ways to help! If you have a trade that would be beneficial to the restoration of the original setting, to include two birthing rooms, please let us know! If you have a trade that might support the long-term vision for the center in any way, including services or products beneficial to pregnant and parenting families, please get in touch and let’s partner. Finally, sharing this campaign goes a long ways in helping us move the vision into reality, and we are grateful for any and all ways that you pass on our information and our needs.</p>

While a mastectomy is always accompanied by a radical removal of all lymph nodes in the axilla on the affected side, a lumpectomy is a lot less invasive... however some “sentinel lymph nodes” are also removed.</p><p>After her surgery, she was given a booklet with a link to a video with some exercises to do, and then she was on her own. After healing, she began lifting weights to regain her strength which ultimately led to her learning she had lymphedema, which often goes undiagnosed.</p><p>Dr. Dohle wanted to help other women, and when she shared her story with friends, they decided to establish DivaCare as an initiative providing a platform designed for women who find themselves in similar situations.</p><p>DivaCare was born in 2016 with a focused goal to develop, deliver, and enhance a mobile application that women can use to improve their health, wellness, and lives after breast cancer surgery through safe and guided exercises.</p><h3>

While a mastectomy is always accompanied by a radical removal of all lymph nodes in the axilla on the affected side, a lumpectomy is a lot less invasive... however some “sentinel lymph nodes” are also removed.After her surgery, she was given a booklet with a link to a video with some exercises to do, and then she was on her own. After healing, she began lifting weights to regain her strength which ultimately led to her learning she had lymphedema, which often goes undiagnosed.Dr. Dohle wanted to help other women, and when she shared her story with friends, they decided to establish DivaCare as an initiative providing a platform designed for women who find themselves in similar situations.DivaCare was born in 2016 with a focused goal to develop, deliver, and enhance a mobile application that women can use to improve their health, wellness, and lives after breast cancer surgery through safe and guided exercises.
Dr. Carolin Dohle-- I am the founder of DivaCare.My Personal StoryThe idea for DivaCare came from my personal experience with breast cancer.I was diagnosed with stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma 2 years ago, at the age of 37. At the time, I had a two and a half year old son and was working full time as a physician. The diagnosis came as a complete shock to me; in an instant, my life was turned upside down.I remember a whirlwind of appointments, talks about prognosis, procedures, fertility.After much deliberation, and consultations with several experts, I decided to undergo a lumpectomy followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy.The ProblemWhat came as a real surprise though was how much these therapies affected my life.I was considered cured, but I was not nearly back to normal. Despite having had a relatively “minor” procedure, I developed some heaviness and pain in my arm that was later diagnosed as early lymphedema.I experienced a decreased range of motion in my right arm and because it was so tight and painful, I had no idea how I could safely return to my previous life. Could I go back to yoga? Lift weights? Carry my son? Carry heavy shopping bags?All of the most recent literature shows that exercise after breast cancer therapy is probably beneficial in avoiding complications such as lymphedema, but there is very little information about how to exercise safely.I had been given stretching exercises after my surgery and initially responded quite well to them. However, the tricky part about radiation is that it will change your tissue immediately after you finish treatments, and for months afterward, so you have to keep going with your exercises even after you are officially “done”.Why Is This Problem ImportantOverall, I was surprised to find during my breast cancer journey that rehabilitation was an overlooked and shockingly neglected topic.While I was undergoing diagnostic studies and treatments, I was in regular touch with my doctors and nurses. But when treatments were done, that interaction was suddenly much less frequent, even though I had just begun the recovery “journey” and was still far from being normal.As a neurologist, I specialize in stroke rehabilitation. I see firsthand the importance of rehabilitation after a devastating illness. I believe that there are many women out there that have very significant limitations after their breast cancer treatments, and are often not aware that physical therapy can help some of these symptoms.What Is Our SolutionAt DivaCare, we want to give you the tools you need to rehabilitate from breast cancer treatment.Our app will ask you if you have symptoms, and suggest that you ask your doctor to refer you to physical therapy if you do.

<p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p>The purely natural and strikingly
beautiful and serene environment of the Ecuadorian Amazon is the
perfect setting for a Zen temple. That was our thought in 2014, when
we moved to Ecuador with the mission of building a Zen temple in this
very particular region.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>Dedicated to spreading the
authentic practice of zazen as we are, we, Gyula and Caroline, a Zen
monk and nun (from the Mokusho sangha, Deshimaru lineage, disciples
of Master Yvon Myoken Bec), have now been living in Tena, in the
Amazonas area of Ecuador, where we are already practicing with a
small group of people.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>Wanting to move forward with our
project to build the first ever Zen temple in Ecuador and in the
Ecuadorian Amazon, we already bought a beautiful plot of land outside
the town, where we are going to build this very special place
dedicateted to the pure practice of zazen. The land is in the
outskirts of the Colonso Chalupas protected area, crossed by two
streams, surrounded by the jungle, so the surroundings could not
invite more to a peaceful life of practice.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>The Execution</b></p>
<p>The temple
will be built of bamboo, using the local
traditional building techniques, and the work will be carried out by
sangha members, friends and volunteers. This will be a beautiful and
balanced self-sustainable place that will accommodate people who
truly want to practice the Buddha Way. 
</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>To make it, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build a
	road and a bridge to facilitate the access to the temple site. The
	building will be elevated by 1m in concrete pillars. The
	construction itself will be mainly bamboo and adobe. We estimate the
	costs of building materials to be around <b>$12.000</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install
	electricity (we need to cover a distance of 500m), which will cost
	<b>$2.500</b>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bring
	water. There are two streams running across the land from which we
	can take water for most uses. We need a pump and pipes to bring it
	to the temple, and tanks to make a water purification system for
	drinking water, which will cost <b>$2.500</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover
	the travel costs for the architect and the bamboo builder expert who
	are going to supervise the construction works, which will require
	<b>$3.000</b>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>The Outlook</b></p>
<p>We intend to firstly build the main
structure of the building and the dojo. If we do not manage to reach
our funding goal of $20,000 for the completed work, we will build as
much as we can – and then continue to do so with the help of the
sangha.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>The Purpose</b></p>
<p>We believe this temple will have a
very positive influence for the local community and the society as a
whole. A zen temple is a place where you can practice together with
others, regardless of the differences of beliefs, creeds, languages
and culture. It will also offer a place where people can practice the
Way of awakening and from where this teaching can spread through
space and time.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>The Master’s Encouragement </b>
</p>
<p>Our Master, Yvon Myoken Bec, has
offered us a very appreciated encouragement. In his own words, ""Gyula
Mokurin Barna and Caroline Nyoze Bacquet are two monks of the
Deshimaru-Zeisler lineage who've been practicing with me for several
years in Europe. They intend to establish a place of practice in
Ecuador to continue there the teaching and transmission lineage of
Master Deshimaru with the help of the Universe, meaning You"".</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>If this calling makes as much
sense to you as it makes to us, we invite you to please take a look
at the rewards that we have on offer, selecting your way of
supporting this wonderful project that all Zen students will surely
appreciate.</b></p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>We also invite you to share it
with your friends and family members who may also be interested in
supporting the construction of Ecuador’s first Zen temple.</b></p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>Also, keep in mind that the climate
and the low living costs here make it possible for anybody to come
and practice with us – so you are more than welcome to come and
join us!</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>If you cannot make a financial
contribution to this project, you are still very welcome to come and
help with the actual building work. Food and accommodation will be
provided for the helpers, and you can also take part in the Zen
practice.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>Thank you very much and we hope to
be reporting soon with very good news about the project’s progress.</p><br/></div>","The Project

	can take water for most uses. We need a pump and pipes to bring it
	to the temple, and tanks to make a water purification system for
	drinking water, which will cost $2.500.


Cover
	the travel costs for the architect and the bamboo builder expert who
	are going to supervise the construction works, which will require
	$3.000.



The Outlook
We intend to firstly build the main
structure of the building and the dojo. If we do not manage to reach
our funding goal of $20,000 for the completed work, we will build as
much as we can – and then continue to do so with the help of the
sangha.

The Purpose
We believe this temple will have a
very positive influence for the local community and the society as a
whole. A zen temple is a place where you can practice together with
others, regardless of the differences of beliefs, creeds, languages
and culture. It will also offer a place where people can practice the
Way of awakening and from where this teaching can spread through
space and time.

The Master’s Encouragement 

Our Master, Yvon Myoken Bec, has
offered us a very appreciated encouragement. In his own words, ""Gyula
Mokurin Barna and Caroline Nyoze Bacquet are two monks of the
Deshimaru-Zeisler lineage who've been practicing with me for several
years in Europe. They intend to establish a place of practice in
Ecuador to continue there the teaching and transmission lineage of
Master Deshimaru with the help of the Universe, meaning You"".

If this calling makes as much
sense to you as it makes to us, we invite you to please take a look
at the rewards that we have on offer, selecting your way of
supporting this wonderful project that all Zen students will surely
appreciate.

We also invite you to share it
with your friends and family members who may also be interested in
supporting the construction of Ecuador’s first Zen temple.

Also, keep in mind that the climate
and the low living costs here make it possible for anybody to come
and practice with us – so you are more than welcome to come and
join us!

If you cannot make a financial
contribution to this project, you are still very welcome to come and
help with the actual building work. Food and accommodation will be
provided for the helpers, and you can also take part in the Zen
practice.

Thank you very much and we hope to
be reporting soon with very good news about the project’s progress.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our products contain zero chemicals while our packaging is 100% recyclable and biodegradable.Skincare products should only contain ingredients that your skin needs. Nothing more, nothing less. JOJOMOKA products retain the highest level of natural nutrients in each ingredient.JOJOMOKA products are designed to work singly or in blended fashion within the product line or with natural food ingredients found in your kitchen. To achieve holistic long term health, blending our ingredients will amplify the efficacy of our products.
How do you really know that the natural and organic skincare products you buy are truly safe for your health and environment? The average woman uses 12 personal care products daily (or nearly 3,000 products in her lifetime) and 89% of more than 10,000 ingredients that go into these products have not been evaluated for safety*. 
The average age of starting to wear make-up is getting as young as 11*.
Synthetic ingredients formulated in commercial skincare products are often called functional ingredients: to smoothen, to stabilise or to thicken, it makes the product usable but in reality it does very little, if nothing, to the health of your skin.
Skincare businesses spend more time and money on packaging than the ingredients of a product. 
*refer to the relevant links in the foot note  Through our work, we became aware how commercial skincare ingredients are mass produced and laden with toxic pesticides. Those ingredients are traded at very low price because there are many companies in between before a skincare product is marketed. On the other hand, there are a small group of artisan farms who produce the highest quality skincare ingredients, that are not only organically grown and food-grade but also produced in the most labour-intensive traditional methods. When we visited those farmers, we realised that many of them are forced to turn to unsustainable mass production methods to survive. That is where JOJOMOKA comes in: to bring these products to market fairly, sustainably and affordably. The majority of JOJOMOKA products are sourced from Japan. Japan has a long tradition of natural therapy using well-studied indigenous herbs and plants grown across the country in diversified natural habitats. Japan has a well-deserved reputation for its dedication to quality, producing many effective and innovative raw ingredients for skincare products. This is the list of the perks you can enjoy when you join JOJOMOKA Indiegogo campaign. Select your choice of perk from the sidebar at the top of this page.

Crysalis Medicine Temple

Devi Temple - Sweatlodge- Rebirthing ChamberManifestationEvolution of CreationSeed and WombCosmic Child TempleGrace of the Divine MotherFollow Progress at http://crysalismedicinetemple.tumblr.com
""Temple of the Heart""

An invitation to Artists, Avatars, Alchemists, Cosmic Children, Builders, Families, Healers, Mystics, Masters, Musicians, Magi, Rainbow Warriors, Prophets, Priestess’, Poets, Pathfinders, Filmmakers,  Shamans, Therapists, Visionaries, Yogis, Herbalists, Tantrics and Truth Bearers. Together we can embark on a sacred journey and a magical mission to create a sacred medicine healing space. With the blessings of The Great Mother, participate in the creation, collaboration and construction of a Cosmic Creative Chrysalis , the Seat of the Mother. 
Built with a Geodesic Dome and seating up to 40 people, this sacred temple is an ecological masterpiece, featuring sacred stones, plants, medicines and instruments from around the world.

Imagine the stem as a walkway lined with medicinal healing plants as one walks towards the Temple as the top loop. On either side of the stem are bath tubs for people to take herbal healing baths with the plant energies they choose to pick on walking up to the temple. 
The purpose of this Temple is to create a permanent, dedicated, consecrated space for ceremonies with sound healing journeys and plant allies . As a group project of construction and consecration, you are warmly invited to contribute either through suggestions, donations of healing or artistic resources ( plants, instruments, books, alchemical resources or suggestions etc ), financial donations for the yurt construction and your prayers.

The Universal Mother is the Supreme Cosmic Energy, Shakti, the creative life force responsible for the flowering of all life forms. As the Goddess of the universe, she is not only the intelligence behind nature but the electromagnetic, energetic root matrix responsible for birthing this planet ( and the entire universe) .

The temple is an invitation for considering transformational and transmutational technologies to be utilised for healing purposes such as water vortexes, plant alchemies, yogas and meditational practices, sound healing technologies ( gongs, crystal bowls etc )

<p> The giving of inspirational messaged Grails is based on a spiritual philosophy that when you choose to give a gift to inspire life, the returns are 10-fold!  The Law of 10-fold return is a universal principle wherein gifts freely given for spiritual use return to the grantor good fortune equal to, or greater than, 10-times the loss. </p>
<p>The Law works on the principle that when a vacuum is created, it must be filled.  When a seed is planted, it will bear fruit greater than its weight and original value.  </p>
<p>Each Grail is hand-made (start-to-finish) in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Our main concern is quality over quantity.   </p>
<p>I am reaching to you because I would like your consideration to be part of Grail Giving.  I believe the Grail will benefit anyone who desires an object to serve as a reminder of how powerful and wonderful life is, especially in times of hardship or trouble.  </p>
<p>The Grails® are proudly handcrafted entirely in the USA.       </p>
<p>The current 2017 design is 5th-generation.  Grails are a physical reminder to help people change their outlook, attitude, and behavior in life through the inspirational messaging.  I consider myself a serial entrepreneur.  This adventure began with an idea and was launched on the proverbial “shoestring” while working more than five-years ago.  Production began in China, but after significant research and development, and constant networking, production of the Grail prototypes are now 100% in the USA.  </p>
<p>I am very proud, and honored, to think of the Grails® as a “shining light”.</p>
<p>All Grails are flameless and therefore safe for home and office.  </p>

Five years ago I started the Grail project on a shoestring and now its finally growing and ready to be launched.  I am passionate, creative and determined to make this company and this idea a huge success. You are invited to become a part of a shift into positivity.  I invite you to join this movement of negative thoughts to positive ones.</p>

<p>The funding will launch production, packaging, printing, shipping, and building a small inventory of Grails consisting of six different colors with six different affirmations.   As explained above, the Affirmation and Abundance Grails are proudly designed and produced in USA.

At the time, Alvaro was living in Germany and Sven in Denmark. Each had the idea to create a brand that would represent their Peruvian roots and allow them to make ancient Peruvian superfoods.</p><p>Without having spoken since they were children, Al and Sven met at a wedding in October 2018, and found out they had both registered a company back in August… four days apart! They hit it off and decided to join forces to create <i><strong>Qhali Kay Organics</strong></i>.</p><p> </p><h3>About us</h3><p><strong>Sven</strong> was born and raised in Lima, Peru, but traveled to Andean regions often where his mom’s side of the family is from. Sven moved to Denmark to live with his dad in 2009 and is currently finishing a master’s degree in Agricultural Economics at the University of Copenhagen.</p><p><strong>Alvaro</strong> was born and raised in Lima, Peru until he was 6 years old. His family moved to the Washington DC area, maintaining many customs and diets that are used in Peru at home. He still remembers when his mom would have to search for many hours to find quinoa and other Peruvian ingredients before they boomed in popularity.</p><p>Our mission with this campaign is to help us grow Qhali Kay Organics faster help improve the nutritional intake of our customers, and strengthen the underdeveloped economy of Peru. Currently, we are a very small business with limited reach and capital, therefore, we wish to seek help to expand our reach among people with similar values to ours, and provide them with the option of authentic, organic Peruvian products using our delicious recipes.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627555107/lnyg0jerd8mhvpa1yvtg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Our new product range</h2><p>We have been working hard to create new amazing products for you, and finally, here they are!</p><p>Our new range of <i><strong>USDA</strong></i> <i><strong>organic</strong></i> products consists of the following:</p><ul>

At the time, Alvaro was living in Germany and Sven in Denmark. Each had the idea to create a brand that would represent their Peruvian roots and allow them to make ancient Peruvian superfoods.Without having spoken since they were children, Al and Sven met at a wedding in October 2018, and found out they had both registered a company back in August… four days apart! They hit it off and decided to join forces to create Qhali Kay Organics. About usSven was born and raised in Lima, Peru, but traveled to Andean regions often where his mom’s side of the family is from. Sven moved to Denmark to live with his dad in 2009 and is currently finishing a master’s degree in Agricultural Economics at the University of Copenhagen.Alvaro was born and raised in Lima, Peru until he was 6 years old. His family moved to the Washington DC area, maintaining many customs and diets that are used in Peru at home. He still remembers when his mom would have to search for many hours to find quinoa and other Peruvian ingredients before they boomed in popularity.Our mission with this campaign is to help us grow Qhali Kay Organics faster help improve the nutritional intake of our customers, and strengthen the underdeveloped economy of Peru.

<h3>Our Mission &amp; Vision</h3>
<p>Through the creation of this physical community space, focused on Yoga, Meditation, Self-Love, nourishment, community Co-creation, and conscious education, our mission is to support each individual on their path of self-realization, personal transformation and conscious living--to Awaken the body, mind &amp; soul of each individual.</p>
<p>We believe each individual desires to live happy, fulfilled and at peace. We know that every person has the ability to decide for this to be a reality in their life. With the right support, environment and guidance, this is possible. Our mission is to support each individual and each other in coming to this realization.</p>
<p>Our intent is to create a unique space for the city of Ottawa is a hub for awakened living, a space of convergence for individuals of heart-centered nature. Awaken is a space for all to come together to celebrate, connect, nourish, breath, dance, move and explore. A space that washes away separation, dogma and old mentalities. A space of inclusion, equality, love-based service, conscious living and a home for one to realize their true nature.<br/> </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Awaken Founder - Corey Sheikh - has been devoted to uncovering the secrets and mysteries that had him questioning and contemplating since a young boy. A deep inner desire and longing to know his purpose, to know the bigger storyline, to understand what life really is. Through years of study and direct experience in a profound array of experiences, he was tested, challenged and constantly pushed into further growth and continued self-realization.</p>
<p>The Journey evolved from a young age, and expanded into his early twenties, where during the creation of the first Ottawa Lifestyle Center within Ottawa, a similar space, focused on fitness, martial arts, meditation and overall wellness.. he experienced a profound spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>This awakening catalyzed into many years of dedicated study of yoga, meditation, detoxification based nutrition, energy work, &amp; entrepreneurship, all pointing to the ultimate goal of inner happiness, well-being, and peace.</p>
<p>This process of transformation eventually led to a time of more solitude, away from the direction of the previous center and into his own heart, alone. It was during this 2 years where he went into the most intense spiritual training of his life. Coming across great master teachers from around the globe, seeking the golden keys that would further support his quest in finding the answer the question ""Who AM I?""</p>
<p>During this time, the clarity of creating a new center, a new foundation emerged. The question arose, ""what would a new-world community center look like? operate like? run like?.... are we ready for such  a space?"". This inquiry fueled the natural synchronicity in which emerged as a vision for this space - 1111A Bank St.</p>
<p>Awaken is a space which has naturally aligned with the intentions of many -- to bring together a community space for awakening, conscious living, heart-centered education and self-love.</p>
<p>A space that is a gathering ground for the yogis, entrepreneurs, visionaries, movement buffs, meditators  artists, yuppies, and simply anyone open, willing and humble enough to embark on their journey of transformation.</p>
<p>Here we are naturally connecting the right leaders, students and members all equally valuable in creating this visionary space.</p>

<h3><strong>Why <i>Setu for You</i>?</strong></h3>
<p>Too often we hear people say they can’t find a yoga teacher who looks like them or understands their body. This is disheartening and we want to surface awareness of more diverse teachers, so people feel seen and appreciated in yoga. <br/><br/>We are building Setu for You a booking service that will be part of our yoga teacher directory. Through Setu for You, you can book 1:1 and small group sessions with diverse teachers. <br/><br/>In awareness that this kind of service is a luxury to use, we are giving 10% of each booking to a yoga non-profit that provides mindfulness practices to in-need communities.</p>

<p><strong>Setu for You</strong> is a service where people can find and book yoga teachers for private and small group yoga sessions.

The teachers will respond within 12 hours and set up an intro call to learn more about you, then confirm the booking.</p>
<p>We will build this booking functionality into our existing yoga teacher directory. The booking experience will be similar to browsing the directory today but with the added navigation and information to guide you in finding a teacher to work with.</p>

<h3><strong>About the team</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://setu.yoga/teacher/libby-nicholaou/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Libby</a>, <a href=""https://setu.yoga/teacher/hillary-lopes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hillary</a> and <a href=""https://setu.yoga/teacher/mary-lou-burkhardt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mary Lou</a> are all yoga teachers, students and community leaders. Libby founded Setu and soon after connected with Mary Lou and Hillary who've been volunteering with Setu ever since. They each are personally invested in the yoga industry and want to see it evolve in a healthier capacity through inclusivity, empowerment and financial balance for teachers and students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Libby Nicholaou</strong></p>
<p>I started Setu after completing my 200 hour yoga training in 2017. It was a time when I experienced the power of yoga. I’m a queer identifying woman and face physical challenges in my body that causes my practice to look different than a fully healthy body. Even though I am white and pass as straight, I didn’t feel comfortable in the mainstream yoga scene. After hearing similar sentiments from others, I decided to contribute to the work of making yoga inclusive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mary Lou Burkhardt</strong></p>
<p>I  like most, dove into yoga by curiosity. I was always looking for ways to move by body and feel good mentally and physically. Yoga continues to help me do this, on and off the mat. I craved to share this with others; those who felt yoga wasn’t for them so that they may thrive as I have. I think of yoga as a beautiful dance I invite my students to perform and explore ways to invite more ease into their lives. I invite them to get pretty from the inside out.</p> <p><strong>Hillary Lopes</strong></p>
<p>Since 2009, yoga has been a source of embodiment  that I can trust and grow with. I am an embodied social activist and yoga and mindfulness teacher who is immersed in the New York yoga community. I hold a vision for the world in which space for my community of sisters and brothers of color to thrive and be well is honored by any means necessary. My yoga practice has given me the space in my heart, body and mind to live more courageously and do so with compassion. I want to be able to share that.</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Ciao Y'all! Dello’s humans here (David and Kayla). If you know us, you know Dello is our baby. He’s not just a dog to us, he’s our kid- he completes our family unit. About a month after Dello turned 2 years old, we found out that he is living with a fatal genetic heart condition, Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy. While this condition is pretty common for Boxers, generally it doesn’t affect them until they are 6-8 years old.  Dello, unfortunately, started expressing symptoms at a year and a half years old.  He collapsed, vomited, and at the vet had a heart rate up to 300bpm (a normal heart rate for adult dogs is between 60 and 120bpm). He needed some emergency doses of Lidocaine to stabilize his heart. He will need to be on heart stabilizing medication for the rest of his life to try to keep his heart beating as regularly as possible. One of the scary realities of this disease is that at any point, with no warning, Dello’s heart will just stop. His cardiologist told us this could happen anywhere in the next few weeks, months, or hopefully years. He is living on borrowed time.  And we need your help to borrow as much time as possible.  </p> <h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>We’re not usually the ones to ask for financial help, but unfortunately, to keep his heart beating as long as possible, we’re facing a big financial struggle. The most basic level of disease maintenance to keep him going will cost us $1700 per year, and that is assuming he doesn’t have another incident where his heart gets triggered and he needs life-saving immediate medical care at the 24-hour medical veterinary center. Unfortunately, he has two of these incidents already this year, and those life-saving visits cost us about $1200 and $3200, respectively. Luckily, we had some room on our credit cards to be able to get him the treatment he needed at the time, but we’re now looking at a lot of credit card debt, interest fees, and a hemorrhaging of our savings. We are hoping to make a dent in the existing debt we’ve built up in the last month and depending on the amount of support we’re able to accrue, be more intensive in the care we are able to provide (holistic veterinary care, cardiac support vitamins and CBD oil for starts) and save money for his future medical costs which will be lifelong. In a perfect world, we would love to raise $10,000 which would cover his existing medical costs ($4400), help keep him going for the next two years with the basic level of care ($3400), and hopefully provide him with some more intensive holistic personalized care to help his heart keep beating.  While we recognize that this a huge number and a lofty goal, we are aiming high. Even if we are unable to meet this goal, any bit of donation will help us continue to provide the level of care Dello needs to continue adventuring with us as long as he can. </p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>As we mentioned, it is extremely humbling for us to ask for help, especially financially. To keep us from feeling like we are simply asking for your charity, we are offering a load of fun perks and items to thank you for helping us keep our family strong and healthy. Dello’s humans love food and are offering some delicious baked goods, homemade hummus, pasta and intimate full-scale dinner experiences. We are offering some fun Dello merch including stickers, thank you cards, and shirts. You can also purchase some goodies for your own pooches including doggie biscuits and tea (homemade broth to enjoy tea time with your dogs)! And for our out of town friends, Dello will personally video chat you to say thank you (and you can catch up with his humans). We sincerely appreciate any help our community can offer and are hoping to express our thanks through the handmade experiences that bring us joy. </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>We’re thankful for any support we can get financially, or otherwise!  If you are interested in helping but are not able to offer any financial support, we would be super grateful if you could help spread the word, offer some time to help us create and package the perks for donors, share the campaign on social media, or send some general good vibes Dello’s way. We appreciate you all so much for your help and love.  </p>
<p>Also, keep an eye out for information about our pop-up pizza night at Lil's Bagels!</p>

The book itself is a brave and authentic memoir that ultimately teaches us how to create a fulfilling life in spite of the threats the modern and often relentless world throws our way, ferocious black dogs included (depression). Covering a span of twenty years worth of experience and research, forty-nine countries and more than a million miles, Tiran’s story rolls along like a sturdy train, leading us in the end to a treasure chest of spiritual and practical tools. Read Tiran to understand how depression stalks its victims and how, in learning to heal from and cope with this very common and deadly disease, we can discover how much more there is to life than meets the conventional, ambitious eye.</p><p>~ 800,000 people die from suicide globally each year (one death every 40 seconds).</p><p>~ Less than 2% of the global median of health budget was allocated to mental health in 2017.</p><p>~ 9 is the median number of health workers per 100,000 people in 2017.</p><p>~ 94,553 women and 127,540 men between the ages of 10 and 29 years committed suicide in 2017.</p><p><strong>""No, I am not okay.""</strong></p><p>How many more lives will suicide claim, before we start realizing the signs, not only in others, but in ourselves? When will it become the norm to raise your hand and say, ""actually, no, I am not okay?""</p><p><strong>Monet Tiran, ""Raising a Black Dog.""</strong></p><p>""Through dialogue, through being honest with our feelings and sharing them, we can make a change. It starts and ends with us, all of us. We all need to be change-makers, no matter how big or small we are, or the change we seek to make is. We do it because we have to, because the earth and the living creatures in it are suffering, and people are taking their lives as a result. Don't seek to make a change for credit or for pats on the back.

Suicide. There was a time when I could hardly get out of bed.

From one dog to another (Emile).</p></div>","HEALTHY SOLUTIONS FOR DEPRESSIONRAISING A BLACK DOG, by Monet Tiran""Raising a Black Dog"" is just one of Monet TIran's two amazing initiatives toward creating awareness of the subject of mental health, and offering real and healthy solutions for those suffering with mental health issues such as depression. The book itself is a brave and authentic memoir that ultimately teaches us how to create a fulfilling life in spite of the threats the modern and often relentless world throws our way, ferocious black dogs included (depression). Covering a span of twenty years worth of experience and research, forty-nine countries and more than a million miles, Tiran’s story rolls along like a sturdy train, leading us in the end to a treasure chest of spiritual and practical tools. Read Tiran to understand how depression stalks its victims and how, in learning to heal from and cope with this very common and deadly disease, we can discover how much more there is to life than meets the conventional, ambitious eye.~ 800,000 people die from suicide globally each year (one death every 40 seconds).~ Less than 2% of the global median of health budget was allocated to mental health in 2017.~ 9 is the median number of health workers per 100,000 people in 2017.~ 94,553 women and 127,540 men between the ages of 10 and 29 years committed suicide in 2017.""No, I am not okay.""How many more lives will suicide claim, before we start realizing the signs, not only in others, but in ourselves? When will it become the norm to raise your hand and say, ""actually, no, I am not okay?""Monet Tiran, ""Raising a Black Dog.""""Through dialogue, through being honest with our feelings and sharing them, we can make a change. It starts and ends with us, all of us. We all need to be change-makers, no matter how big or small we are, or the change we seek to make is. We do it because we have to, because the earth and the living creatures in it are suffering, and people are taking their lives as a result. Don't seek to make a change for credit or for pats on the back. Do it as a selfless act of kindness, and kindness shall find its way back to you.""""Give, and it shall be given unto you."" (Luke 6:38).SPREADING THE PRANA""I have dealt with depression off and on throughout my life, but there was a brief period where it's safe to say that I only thought about one thing every day. Suicide. There was a time when I could hardly get out of bed. One day I'm jetting around the world, rising through the corporate ranks, growing cash, the next, I'm in a psyche ward eating medicine. Prana, combined with good friends, good doctors and a lot of compassion, is how I overcame my struggle and suffering and to this day continue into a hopeful and rewarding future.""Prana is the Sanskrit word for ""breath"" and is often used in referring to the ""life force"" or ""life energy.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Wulf Fitness was founded in 2016, and have designed and created high-quality sportswear, with an initial stock ready for pre-sale, marketing and testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our high-quality fitness &amp; sportswear is suitable for both sports and leisure activities. They are all 100% vegan, including no wool or silk and in the future, we intend to include more Eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo.</li>
<li>After first-hand experience of Homeless Shelters, from both volunteering and having a number of friends who have been homeless on several occasions, it seems the problem continues to get worse. To the point, The Guardian recently wrote 'homelessness is reaching a point that is penetrating the public consciousness and that we have, indeed, gone back to the 80s.' and many people have become so numb to it, they barely bat an eyelid to see many streets with piled up boxes and sleeping bags, the only possessions of an unfortunate human being.</li>
<li>
<p> </p>
<p>Whilst most Indiegogo campaigns are for start-ups or not yet formed companies, we have already begun selling our products and as such our stock is ready to go. However, we would love to expand our range and multiply the number of people we can help, the more we can donate, the more effectively we can help. Investing in this project will grant you a discount on the sportswear - whilst we <strong>still donate the full amount. </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, what do we want and what's in it for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned previously, we will use this money to help expand our range, moving on to socks, beanies and jogging bottoms. A larger range means we will have more products ready to donate, and more projects that can be created.</li>
<li>The early bird perk special will grant you a discount on all of our range, and preorders. This does not affect the amount we donate.</li>
<li>As we already have stock ready to go there is <i>no negative implication</i> of us not reaching our goal, it will all go towards forwarding the company and progressing us to the next level. If, however, we exceed our goals we will immediately commence work on our next ranges and began marketing more aggressively.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are over 250,000 homeless people in the UK alone (Shelter's estimations for 2016) we aim to help as many of these as we can, and then focus internationally as our projects become more ambitious:</p>
<ul>
<li>We, in the UK, spend £5.9Bn on sportswear a year (figures from 2014) and we aim to use some of this expenditure and therefore the huge profits in this industry, to help out local communities.</li>
<li>The difference we can make is very real, for every item you buy someone in need will receive a brand new piece of clothing, too. You can keep up with our new projects and see us in action over at our website.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we are only a small company, we have a relatively small cash flow compared to other competitors in the market. Another problem is that we do not have private factories, this could be reflected by slightly longer lead times on new ranges and restocking</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, and that's fine, if you'd like to help us in other ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Please Tweet, Facebook and share the link on any other social media outlets. (Indiegogo also has inbuilt share tools)</li>
<li>For any press releases or any other contact, please email - wulffitness@gmail.com and we will endeavour to reply as quickly as possible.</li>

<p><strong>Summary of Group</strong></p>
<p>The Tennessee Tails are a group of University of Tennessee students working with Anderson County Animal Rescue Foundation. We are crowdfunding to raise money and awareness for the ACARF non-profit. We are a diverse group of students  with a range of talents. Together we can make a change </p>
<p><strong>Summary of Organization   </strong>  </p>
<p>The Anderson County Animal Rescue Foundation is a registered 501 c(3) organization consisting of volunteers dedicated to promoting the welfare and humane treatment of animals in Anderson and surrounding counties. Their goal is to build and maintain a state of the art Animals Adoption Center. This facility will partner with local rescues and animal welfare agencies to coordinate adoption events, accommodate adoptable animals, host low and no cost spay/ neuter and vaccination clinics, and advance their collective outreach and educational programs and events. </p>
<p><strong>The Issue / Needs </strong></p>
<p>The issue of overcrowded animal shelters is a problem.  Anderson County Animal Rescue Foundation wants everyday animal to get adopted  and find their forever home. ACARF and the Tennessee Tails need donations to help animals find their forever homes.   </p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Animals need places to call home, a steady and consistent environment is helpful! The animals are open and willing to love!</p>
<p><strong>What The Money Will Go To </strong></p>
<p>The money from the Tennessee Tails crowdfunding campaign will go directly to Anderson County Animal Rescue Foundation.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Tails are working to find rescued dogs homes. The top priority is a sweetheart dog named Darcy. </p>
<p> Darcy is a 65 lb young adult terrier mix with a beautiful unique look.  She was pulled from Cleveland Animal Control in July.  She is happy and exuberant at home and ALWAYS in a good mood, but she is still working to gain confidence in public.  She is extremely smart and willing and only wants to please her people.  She comes running with a smile and a butt wiggle every time she is called.  With only 3 formal obedience sessions under her belt, she heels so well that she gets mistaken for a service dog.  She wears a special vest while in public that gives her a little space.  It allows her foster family to control her interactions to ensure they will all be slow and positive.  She is quickly learning, with the help of kind strangers and yummy treats, that she can trust humans.  She won’t need the vest forever, but for now, it allows her to go just about anywhere except for a dog park.  Sometimes she doesn’t react well to a strange dog in her face while on leash.  However, she lives in her foster home with 3 other dogs and a cat, and she adores every one of them.  She seems to thrive as part of a pack and she copies their confidence.  She can be trusted unconditionally with all of them, even with toys scattered around the room.  She has a special bond with former Slumdog Darnell, who is similar age and size (~3 years old, 70 lbs).  They love to play rough and they go everywhere together.   She also loves her two smaller foster dog brothers, but shows it with an affectionate lick to the muzzle at every opportunity, rather than the rough play.  Even though she moves a bit like a bulldozer, she is very aware and respectful of how much smaller they are.  She desperately wants to be friends with the cat, and even though she gets a hateful whack on the nose almost every interaction, she doesn’t give up.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Darcy is looking for her forever home!  She would love a fenced in yard, at least one other dog, and a family who understands her insecurities and is willing to help her work through them.            </p>

<p><strong>REFILLABLE DEODORANT</strong></p>
<p> It will help you reduce single use plastic in your life which has to be a good thing. Ultimately reducing the plastic we manufacture globally is the best way to reduce the amount that ends up in the environment causing untold damage. Even if you have been recycling your old deodorant packs (well done you) it is still putting pressure on recycling systems, many still end up in landfill or worst our oceans. Our refillable deodorant is the solution. Buy just one outer case and when you run out simply buy the natural deodorant refill, pop it in, twist down and reduce your plastic usage by over 98%.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562343964/vjeznssujpwtvk7pl3dl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>NATURAL DEODORANT </strong><br/>The most important measure of all our products is that they work. This one uses a state of the art plant powered fermentation technique that will neutralise body odour using fermented enzymes that catalyse odours into their heavier molecular weight and non-odorous form. Our natural stick deodorant is also aluminium, paraben and petroleum free, vegan and avoids any ingredients that you shouldn’t put into your armpit making the best option for a healthier you. Breast Cancer Care actively suggests avoiding aluminium anti perspirants and there are concerns about their impact on the endocrine (your hormonal) system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>100% PROFITS TO WaterAid</strong><br/>Once we fund the launch and delivery of your Refillable Natural Deodorant the story will only just be beginning. You will have then put us in a position to create a sustainable social enterprise business that will be able to give 100% of future profits* from the World’s Kindest Deodorant to the charity WaterAid - an international not-for-profit, determined to make clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene normal for everyone, everywhere within a generation.

<p>2. <strong>Your health and your families</strong> - using a safer product everyday on an underarm area full of lymph nodes.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Other people</strong> - we have signed contracts with WaterAid to work in partnership on this project.</p>
<p>Proverb launched 18 months ago but we hope, with your help, to create a sustainable social enterprise arm of our business which gives away 100% of the profit. Our most ambitious project yet.</p>
<p><strong>BUT WHY WATERAID?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we have our daughter Layla to thank for that. Back in 2016, when she was just 6, Luke was talking to Layla about their plan as a family to give 10% of their disposable income to a charity that could help families that were less fortunate than themselves. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562324978/eu3mhfuaq3poqxk0cajd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As they sat watching YouTube videos from several charities, this WaterAid one really struck a chord with Layla, she was shocked that there are children in the world that had to walk 4 miles a day for dirty water! This reaction is not a new one but her solution to the problem was one that only the open mindedness of youth could conceive, “why not give them 100% of our income?”</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEay1KZ2zaU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>At the time the thought of giving 100% of our family disposable income away seemed to be the beautifully naive thoughts of a kind hearted 6 year old but not long after we realised that a social enterprise business could indeed give away 100% of its disposable income (profit). A chance meeting with the inspiration, Karen Lynch, CEO of Belu Water (who give 100% of their profits to WaterAid - £1million last year) made them realise that they could achieve a family dream by creating a sustainable business that would combine their passions for clean, natural, effective products with their drive for wellbeing not only for their customers but the planet.</p>
<p>Over the next 5 years we aim to raise £500,000 which will go towards supporting WaterAid’s mission to deliver clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene everywhere to everyone within a generation. We are blessed to have the help and guidance of Belu Water who have achieved this with great success.</p>

<p>We are the co-founders and owners of 2 Natural and Organic skincare brands.</p>
<p>Our first brand Pinks Boutique is a Soil Association organic certified skincare range with 60 products used by over 120 UK spas including John Lewis &amp;beauty spas, Cowley Manor and the Scarlet. It is 10 years old. In her early 20s Kirstie started, ran and sold a very successful beauty training school which trained over 1500 students a year.</p>
<p>We have spent 10 years immersed in natural and organic product development, sustainability of ingredients and packaging. Proverb is our newest brand and will house the deodorant which will be unisex and for all armpits.</p>
<p>Proverb is a collision of Kirstie’s 20 year’s expertise, creating certified clean, natural and organic skincare and Luke's 2 degrees in human health and genetics from Oxford University, where we both met. </p>
<p>While studying Biological Anthropology Luke signed a professional rugby contract playing for 11 years in the English Premiership and Championship representing Harlequins RFU (7 years), captaining them in the Heineken Cup and also playing in the England 7s, Great Britain 7’s and the Barbarians squads. Those years of elite sports nutrition, training and fixation on performance as a professional athlete are core to our Proverb ingredient choice and ethos of 360 degree health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We have self-funded both brands and we have run them with no more than 4 full time people at anyone time including us. We are a total of 17 years into working for ourselves and that rollercoaster called entrepreneurism.  </p>

<p>“The first time Kirstie and Luke heard the Belu water story in detail, I was chairing a panel for a WaterAid event for International day of the girl. They got almost as excited as I do on the social enterprise model – (a business that exist primarily to make positive change in the world). They were fascinated to learn how our 100% of profits to WaterAid model worked, given our business also has an ‘environment first’ approach.  It has been joyous to spend time around my kitchen table with this powerhouse of a team, to see their idea develop and to embrace both those things.  This product that truly innovates in its sector to reduce waste.  Combine this with transforming lives through access to clean water through a small change to your personal hygiene routine… what’s not to like? I’ll be signing up for sure.”</p>

<p>How does your support help us deliver the product to market?</p>
<p><strong>Proverb stands for a “statement of truth or advice”</strong> and so we aim to be totally transparent about how your funding will help us bring this dream to life. </p>
<p>We always get the feeling that nowadays product crowdfunding can be a little misleading as businesses in fact have the products already manufactured and are just using it as marketing. So, let us tell you exactly where we are with our mission and why we can’t complete it without you.  </p>
<p><strong>Packaging Design</strong> - Version 1 of the refillable case design is done which is what you can see on the campaign page. We have not put this into production though as we need funding to do so. Plus if we overfund the campaign it opens up more possibility to improve the design of the refillable case. We have a working prototype now but only 1!!</p>
<p><strong>Natural Deodorant Formulations and scents </strong>- We have been working on and testing the formula for the last 18 months and have 2 versions (scents) signed off. They have been through all legal and human armpit testing ready for manufacturing. The funds will enable this production to happen. For this project to have the biggest impact possible we hope to launch in key retail stores who will require us to formulate more scents which will require funding. </p>
<p><strong>Deodorant Manufacturing</strong> - We have trialled and created a solution to produce the deodorant refill on a scale to meet the demands of our campaign, but we are believers that you could always do better. If we smash crowd funding and raise over ½ million pounds then we could look at a new engineering technology to make the manufacturing process for the refills more time efficient, less impactful and more sustainable. Once they have the packaging the manufacturing team are ready to put the first run into action, all they need now is an order! </p>
<p><strong>Printing Refill Packaging</strong> - Quite simply we need to design this and pay for it all to be made! We have an awesome idea of what it will look like (see above) but we need to finalise design, work with suppliers to make sure ink, cardboard, wrapping is at the very least 100% recyclable, compostable and sustainable. Our vision is to overfund and find the ultimate biodegradable packaging so you can take protecting the environment into your own hands!</p>
<p><strong>Delivering your order </strong>- Once we have reached our target we can put the first run into production and get the warehouse stocked up. We already have an integrated stock-management system,      e-commerce website and logistics in place for <a href=""http://www.proverbskin.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.proverbskin.com</a>. However, our expectation is that we will need to increase shelving capacity, manufacturing staffing and the warehouse team required to deliver your order in good time. Fingers crossed we have so many orders to ship out that Kirstie and Luke will be doing the night shift!</p>
<p><strong>Timescales</strong> - With funding in place from a successful campaign the team have a detailed timeline to complete the above projects during September and October 2019 to ensure that your orders are fulfilled worldwide in November 2019, the perfect Christmas present. Overfunding will also mean that we will be able to produce prototypes of an extension to the range, a Proverb body wash, shampoo and conditioner to also go into our 100% of profits to WaterAid product gang. We will then target key spa, gym &amp; hotel partners to convince them to stock the World’s Kindest Wash Room Amenities.</p>
<p>The crowdfunding will enable us to finish and actually produce all the products. It doesn’t have a marketing budget within it or money for more team members all of which would have a huge impact. Feel free to help us smash the total so we can add this in and start shouting about it all.</p>
<p>In short together we are on the brink of delivering something incredible… YOU ROCK!!</p>

</div></div>","REFILLABLE DEODORANT
 It will help you reduce single use plastic in your life which has to be a good thing. Ultimately reducing the plastic we manufacture globally is the best way to reduce the amount that ends up in the environment causing untold damage. Even if you have been recycling your old deodorant packs (well done you) it is still putting pressure on recycling systems, many still end up in landfill or worst our oceans. Our refillable deodorant is the solution. Buy just one outer case and when you run out simply buy the natural deodorant refill, pop it in, twist down and reduce your plastic usage by over 98%.

 

 
NATURAL DEODORANT The most important measure of all our products is that they work. This one uses a state of the art plant powered fermentation technique that will neutralise body odour using fermented enzymes that catalyse odours into their heavier molecular weight and non-odorous form. Our natural stick deodorant is also aluminium, paraben and petroleum free, vegan and avoids any ingredients that you shouldn’t put into your armpit making the best option for a healthier you. Breast Cancer Care actively suggests avoiding aluminium anti perspirants and there are concerns about their impact on the endocrine (your hormonal) system.
 
100% PROFITS TO WaterAidOnce we fund the launch and delivery of your Refillable Natural Deodorant the story will only just be beginning. You will have then put us in a position to create a sustainable social enterprise business that will be able to give 100% of future profits* from the World’s Kindest Deodorant to the charity WaterAid - an international not-for-profit, determined to make clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene normal for everyone, everywhere within a generation. A basic human right.
The deodorant market is worth $70 billion a year, it’s an established beauty habit that needs disrupting. Let’s get started…
*100% of the profits from the sale of the World’s Kindest Refillable Natural Deodorant, with a minimum donation of £50,000, will go to WaterAid, an international not-for-profit, determined to make clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene normal for everyone, everywhere within a generation.
 

It will take 60 seconds of your time.
Please help us grow this community of people who want to reduce plastic in the oceans, eliminate health risks due to deodorants and help WaterAid.

For your first purchase you need to buy the Refillable Natural Deodorant. You will receive your hardwearing outer case with a deodorant stick.  When you run out you simply buy the refill and place into the original case. You can swap scents, you’ll be doing good for the planet and smelling awesome.

Keep your original hardwearing outer case.
Remove the empty cradle and recycle it.
Simply pop in the new deodorant refill and twist it down.
You can swap scents or stick to your favourite. 




THE IMPACT IS 3 FOLD..
1. The planet - remember in just year one when we hit our sale targets we will have saved 130,000 deodorant containers.
2. Your health and your families - using a safer product everyday on an underarm area full of lymph nodes.
3. Other people - we have signed contracts with WaterAid to work in partnership on this project.

<p>  These clients often feel alone and overwhelmed.  <i>Many </i>of them do not receive family support to change their diets, and this is so important.

We have been there ourselves. In 2015, Cathy began experiencing health issues, and was not comfortable taking conventional medicine due to possible side effects. We were so intrigued by the role food plays in overall health that Cathy became a nutritional consultant. Both of us have improved our diets and began eating as much organic food as possible. We wondered if we could grow our own organic produce. Now, we do!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Myrtle Beach SC is an area that has a large elderly population, and proportionately, many residents live with serious health issues. Most of these clients are well over 65 years old, are seriously ill, and many live alone. In Cathy's work as a senior caregiver, she sees many seniors who are malnourished because they either do not want to cook entire meals for themselves, or they don't know what to buy, how to cook it, or how to combine foods. These clients will be able to choose meals weekly from a menu specifically prescribed according to their individual needs. The meals will be frozen for them, and delivered, and they can simply heat them and eat. It will be easy for them to eat healthy and flavorful meals and stay within their nutritional guidelines.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since the majority of clients will be elderly and have health challenges, retention will unfortunately be a factor if a client passes away. Cathy &amp; John intend to launch this business with 8-10 individuals, providing a week's worth of lunches and dinners for each.  They also anticipate maintaining a waiting list to keep the client number consistent. Cathy &amp; John have been cooking privately for two people for the last year, and have excellent communication with these clients as to their likes and dislikes.  Both clients are satisfied and still receive weekly deliveries.  Myrtle Beach SC is a coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean, so there is a slight possibility of business being interrupted by a hurricane, so just putting it out there to keep things real. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>ANY amount of money that you can contribute is accepted in humble gratitude! If you cannot contribute money, you can still help by sharing the campaign to your list of friends on Facebook and your email lists. If you belong to any civic organizations, share this campaign. If you live in a retirement community, you can share this campaign and ask Cathy &amp; John Andrews and Linda Runk to come talk to your group about healthy eating, and receiving medically prescribed foods tailored for individual needs. Gift certificates are available to purchase a week's worth of food (lunches and dinners) for someone. </p>

<h3>Help us reach 501(c)(3)status</h3>
<p>Your Special Day was created to provide well deserving and underprivileged children with wellness and safety strategies all while creating positive memories by rewarding these children with a day solely for and about them.

<p>Additionally, although we may face the challenge of not raising enough funding with this initial campaign, we plan on reaching our goal by being diligent and persistent to ensure that we achieve our financial goal to get our nonprofit organization off the ground and into our community.</p>

Additionally, although we may face the challenge of not raising enough funding with this initial campaign, we plan on reaching our goal by being diligent and persistent to ensure that we achieve our financial goal to get our nonprofit organization off the ground and into our community.
Other Ways You Can Help
We know that everyone cannot donate at the moment. However, you can still help out tremendously by making some noise! Help us get the word out about our campaign by sharing our page and our posts.

<h3><i>Long story short...</i></h3>
<p>The Cabin is an oasis from the hectic city life. Located in rural Spain, nearby Valencia city, it is an idyllic, sacred, off-the-grid place for Individual Retreats, workshops, and community projects.</p>
<p>Kamila, the initiator of the project, has decided to dedicate her life to helping others <strong>to find their true self</strong> and by teaching them how to re-connect with themselves and with the <strong>healing powers of Mother Nature</strong>. ""<i>I am a transpersonal therapist, nature lover and artist. So far I have been giving treatments in a rented apartment. Now I feel the time has come to take it a step further</i>."" - says Kamila. The plan is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>move to a quiet place in Nature </li>
<li>create a Safe, Sacred and Healing space</li>
<li>host people from all over the world.</li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What exactly will happen in The Cabin?</h3>
<p>The Cabin will be used to host Individual Retreats, that will give the Guest a chance to have some quiet “me” time, develop their meditation practice, have time for reflection away from work or family and to deepen their spiritual life.</p>
<p>The treatments offered in The Cabin:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.tantricjourney.com/tantric-treatments/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">deep holistic body therapy</a>, that will help you to get rid of physical and <a href=""http://emotionaldetox.eu/about-emotional-detox/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">emotional toxins</a>,</li>

</ul>
<p>Apart from the retreats, you will be able to attend the  workshops, Sacred Ceremonies and to participate in community projects (gardening, permaculture, living off-grid, etc.)</p>
<h3><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></h3>
<p>We are still looking for the right place, and have found a couple of houses that could potentially meet our needs. These are the estimates of how much money we need  and where it will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>~35,000€ to buy a small house with a piece of land+ fees  (including indiegogo) &amp; taxes</li>
<li>~13,000€ for renovation &amp; insurance</li>
<li>~3,000€ to build 2 additional constructions ( super <a href=""https://www.diynatural.com/cob-house-construction/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cute cob houses</a>)</li>
<li>~2,500€ to instal solar panels</li>
<li>~1,000€ to buy furniture + appliances</li>
<li>~499€ to buy equipment (for massage, yoga, meditations, music, etc)</li>
<li>we also need volunteers who have experience in off-grid living, permaculture &amp; building</li>

<h3><i>What's in it for You?</i></h3>
<p>If this projects gets fully funded, every person who backs us or helps us by spreading the word, will be able to visit us in the lovely Cabin, to buy a treatment or come for a longer Retreat. Additionally, we <strong>offer substantial discounts for Personalized Retreats</strong>, treatments and workshops for top backers, and respective smaller discounts too!</p>
<p><strong>... and if we don't reach the entire goal?</strong></p>
<p>We won't give up! We will keep looking for other ways to get funded, and we'll keep you updated about the progress. We will try to find alternative solutions, for example some of the treatments can be carried out in Kamila's home practice. We will make sure we communicate with you, but most of all, we will make sure The Cabin will become reality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact - we make this world a better place</u></h3>
<p>Kamila says: <i>""I believe that the kind of Holistic Body work that I offer is one of the most effective therapies that can help people who struggle with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, PTSDF and a range of other<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520529260/pgpatucnx9qcib4clrgc.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> challenges. It is also a powerful tool for people who want to develop their spirituality and feel truly connected with the Source"".</i></p>
<p>Kamila has already succeeded in opening her own practice in Valencia, where she has been working as a therapist since Autumn 2017. On her <a href=""https://detoxemocional.info/galeria/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spanish website</a> you can read <strong>her clients' testimonials </strong>as well as see the gallery of her home studio.</p>
<p><i><strong>""By moving to The Cabin,  this work will become even more meaningful. Surrounded and supported  by Nature, we will provide excellent conditions for healing and transformation.""</strong></i></p>
<p>Moreover, we will prove that living off-the-grid is easy and safe (and comfortable!) and we strongly believe it can help to <strong>promote eco-friendly, conscious, simple living </strong>on a global scale.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we want to keep the costs to a minimum, we are looking for a humble rural house. We've already found a few candidates. However, many of such houses in Spain have been build 'illegally' meaning they haven't been registered as homes. This means we might need to spend extra money on the legal matters. </p>
<p>Another challenge is to make The Cabin sustainable in terms of money - the beginnings might not be easy - before the world hears about us. For that reason, Kamila will keep working as a therapist in Valencia city part-time. We will also use help of volunteers in this project - we have worked as volunteers ourselves, and it has always been such a rewarding thing to do!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ol>
<li>Become a volunteer! Once we've bought the land, we will need extra help to make it shine</li>
<li>Share this project with people You think would be willing to invest some money in The Cabin. Use some catchy frases to approach them, have them see all the perks &amp; benefits they can get, like having a chance to re-connect with themselves and to become a  happier person, hey, who wouldn't like that?!</li>

<h3>We still need contributions!</h3>
<p>Even though we've hit our 2nd goal of $12,000 doesn't mean we're where we need to be. That was just an initial amount to make sure we hit our goal for Indiegogo to release our funds and allow us to still receive much-needed contributions after the campaign is over. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>✓ $5,000 ✓</h3>
<p>We did it! Thanks, everyone :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>✓ $12,000 ✓</h3>
<p>Wow, we just made it!! Now we can provide animals to all 3 villages! Everyone is so excited. We're putting the plan into action over the next couple of weeks so stay tuned.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>$25,000</h3>
<p>This will allow us to go beyond the 3 initial villages and turn this into a growing movement across Africa. Please help us reach this before the end of the year.</p>

<h3>Help Preserve the Fountain of Unlimited Health Uniquely Found in Micro Communities Around the World</h3>
<p>In a few places in the world, the natural state of our perfect health remains.  These communities provide a window of what is possible.  They show that illness (both chronic and immediate) is an unnatural state.  However, the health of these communities is under threat. </p>
<p>Humanitarian and environmental efforts have begun to whittle away at their traditional diets and have encroached on their land.  The children are being fed a school lunch of water, beans, corn, sugar, and vegetable oil. </p>
<p>If this continues, we will see the same decline in health that we have seen all over the world.  Soon, they too will think that chronic disease and ill-health are normal.  At Cows 4 Kids, our mission is to provide the school children with their traditional tribal diet and to help community members preserve their ancient dietary knowledge in a modern setting. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Here at Cows 4 Kids, we find that it is not good enough to reverse disease.  We are in the business of stopping it all together.  Each of the communities we support consumes a different traditional diet, yet they all maintain perfect health.  We provide them with the animals to continue their unique ancestral diets and keep their wisdom alive.</p>

<h3>Why We Are Different </h3>
<p>The beauty of giving an animal to a village, is that it is self-sustaining.  These animals will have babies that will have babies, providing unlimited generations with nutrient-dense ancestral nourishment.  This is not a handout.  Further, none of these animals require feed in these regions, as they graze on the wild plants.  The communities supported by Cows 4 Kids have a heritage of animal rearing, and already maintain the skills to keep vibrantly healthy animals. </p>

<h3>Maasai Village</h3>
<p>The Maasai live in Tanzania in the valley of Kilimanjaro.  Their traditional diet includes raw milk, blood, goat meat, beef, and herbal tea.  Although the children have their traditional diets at home, they are fed vegetable oil, corn, and beans at school.  For this Maasai village, 10 cows and 20 goats are needed for the school to provide a proper Maasai lunch.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Chagga Village</h3>
<p>The Chagga live on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.  Their traditional diet includes fresh glacial water, milk, butter, goat meat, beef, chicken, fish, eggs, banana, taro, avocado, mango, sorghum, and millet.  In the last hundred years, maize has replaced sorghum.  With this initiative, our goal is to promote proper processing of maize using the five-stage process.  This process is necessary to avoid pellagra and malnutrition.  In addition, we aim to provide enough chickens, goats, and cows to feed the children their traditional diet while at school.  Currently, they are being fed a gruel comprised of unprocessed maize, beans, and water.  For this Chagga village, 20 cows, 30 goats, and 60 chickens are needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Batwa Village</h3>
<p>The Batwa are in a unique situation in Uganda, as they have been displaced by the 1991 Bwindi National Park laws.  Traditionally living as hunter gatherers, the Batwa have always maintained perfect health.  However, as they are now displaced, they can no longer procure their food from hunting, and their health is rapidly declining.  They are in urgent need of livestock.  For this Batwa village, 20 cows, 50 goats, and 60 chickens are needed.</p>

</div></div>","We still need contributions!
Even though we've hit our 2nd goal of $12,000 doesn't mean we're where we need to be. That was just an initial amount to make sure we hit our goal for Indiegogo to release our funds and allow us to still receive much-needed contributions after the campaign is over. 
 
✓ $5,000 ✓
We did it! Thanks, everyone :)
 
✓ $12,000 ✓
Wow, we just made it!! Now we can provide animals to all 3 villages! Everyone is so excited. We're putting the plan into action over the next couple of weeks so stay tuned.
 
$25,000
This will allow us to go beyond the 3 initial villages and turn this into a growing movement across Africa. Please help us reach this before the end of the year.
 
 

 
Help Preserve the Fountain of Unlimited Health Uniquely Found in Micro Communities Around the World
In a few places in the world, the natural state of our perfect health remains.  These communities provide a window of what is possible.  They show that illness (both chronic and immediate) is an unnatural state.  However, the health of these communities is under threat. 
Humanitarian and environmental efforts have begun to whittle away at their traditional diets and have encroached on their land.  The children are being fed a school lunch of water, beans, corn, sugar, and vegetable oil. 
If this continues, we will see the same decline in health that we have seen all over the world.  Soon, they too will think that chronic disease and ill-health are normal.  At Cows 4 Kids, our mission is to provide the school children with their traditional tribal diet and to help community members preserve their ancient dietary knowledge in a modern setting. 
Learn more about the positive impact we have and join us in bringing about Cows 4 Kids!
 

 
Here at Cows 4 Kids, we find that it is not good enough to reverse disease.  We are in the business of stopping it all together.  Each of the communities we support consumes a different traditional diet, yet they all maintain perfect health.  We provide them with the animals to continue their unique ancestral diets and keep their wisdom alive.

<h3>The Heroic Journey: Teaching Kids Empathy and Resilience. Ending Bullying.</h3>
<p>We turn kids’ struggles into strengths, with mental health skills that last a lifetime. Teaching inclusion and ending bullying in all its forms!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Jeanie Burdi. I am raising money for Pop Culture Hero Coalition, a powerful charity using psychology to end bullying in schools. My friends, family, and I have all been victims of bullying. </p>
<p><br/>Every child deserves to be psychologically and physically safe. And secure, empathetic, and resilient kids are the key to a positive future for us all. But research shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>48-90% of children 9-12 of age are victims of bullying at school or online.</li>
<li>80% of teen suicides may be attributable to bullying.</li>
<li>A growing percentage of children and teens experience depression, anxiety, fear, shame, loneliness, self-doubt, anger, addiction, and suicidal ideation.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2021, Pop Culture Hero Coalition launched The Heroic Journey Curriculum — the 1st program to teach crucial mental health skills and bullying prevention using stories from TV, comics, and film, which children and teens (and adults!) find relatable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
<p>Created by psychologists and veteran educators, The Heroic Journey’s 32 lesson plans teach crucial skills over a period of time, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Violence prevention </li>
<li>Responding to bullying, racism, misogyny, LGBTQIA+bullying </li>
<li>Teaching empathy </li>
<li>Resilience </li>
<li>How to seek help </li>
<li>Teaching healthy personal identity (crucial for ending fear and bias)</li>
<li>Ending implicit bias and becoming allies for targets</li>
<li>Healthy conflict resolution </li>
<li>Creating restorative justice</li>
<li>Navigating peer pressure</li>
<li>Creating positive peer relationships and activities</li>
<li>Navigating anger, depression, anxiety, which can lead to behaviors such as self-harm, addiction, and suicidal ideation</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Heroic Journey is THE program used by YMCA of the USA nationwide for mental health and bullying prevention — impacting over <strong>200,000 children and their parents</strong> in 2021. </p>
<p>Now more than ever, it is crucial to teach children these life-saving skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WITH YOUR HELP</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>

</div></div>","The Heroic Journey: Teaching Kids Empathy and Resilience. Ending Bullying.
We turn kids’ struggles into strengths, with mental health skills that last a lifetime. Teaching inclusion and ending bullying in all its forms!
 
OUR MISSION
Hello, my name is Jeanie Burdi. I am raising money for Pop Culture Hero Coalition, a powerful charity using psychology to end bullying in schools. My friends, family, and I have all been victims of bullying. 
Every child deserves to be psychologically and physically safe. And secure, empathetic, and resilient kids are the key to a positive future for us all. But research shows that:

48-90% of children 9-12 of age are victims of bullying at school or online.
80% of teen suicides may be attributable to bullying.
A growing percentage of children and teens experience depression, anxiety, fear, shame, loneliness, self-doubt, anger, addiction, and suicidal ideation.

 
In 2021, Pop Culture Hero Coalition launched The Heroic Journey Curriculum — the 1st program to teach crucial mental health skills and bullying prevention using stories from TV, comics, and film, which children and teens (and adults!) find relatable.
 
THE SOLUTION
Created by psychologists and veteran educators, The Heroic Journey’s 32 lesson plans teach crucial skills over a period of time, including: 

Violence prevention 
Responding to bullying, racism, misogyny, LGBTQIA+bullying 
Teaching empathy 
Resilience 
How to seek help 
Teaching healthy personal identity (crucial for ending fear and bias)
Ending implicit bias and becoming allies for targets
Healthy conflict resolution 
Creating restorative justice
Navigating peer pressure
Creating positive peer relationships and activities
Navigating anger, depression, anxiety, which can lead to behaviors such as self-harm, addiction, and suicidal ideation

 
The Heroic Journey is THE program used by YMCA of the USA nationwide for mental health and bullying prevention — impacting over 200,000 children and their parents in 2021. 
Now more than ever, it is crucial to teach children these life-saving skills.
 
WITH YOUR HELP
 

Our goal is to raise $50,000 to distribute The Heroic Journey Curriculum to kids in need.
100% of the proceeds goes to distributing this crucial work to schools.
We will reach 225 teachers and 6,750 students EACH YEAR, in perpetuity.
We are offering Be Kind T-Shirts, Tote Bags, Water Bottles, and Pay It Forward Heroic Journey Curriculum Bundles! What better message is there?

 
THE IMPACT
 Research shows that teaching the tools used in The Heroic Journey positively affects children’s lives as many as 18 years after learning them.
Created by psychologists and veteran educators, The Heroic Journey harnesses the phenomenon of stories kids love, along with evidence-based psychology — and teaches them to be heroes — for themselves and each other.
We must teach children and teens empathy and resilience, for all of our sakes. Our future is in their hands.

The only risk is not reaching our goal. We must teach children these crucial skills — before it is too late.

<h3> L'impact</h3>

<li> En permettant de pousser la philosophie du Qigong au sein des entreprises, afin que l'Humain y ait une place prédominante.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dialekta, l'agence marketing où je travaille est le meilleur exemple que je puisse prendre, nous sommes ouverts à un bien-être des personnes qui travaillent, en proposant des massages sur chaise, de la méditation, et bientôt du Qigong !</p>
</div><div>
<h3> Risques et défis</h3>
<p> Après avoir fait le niveau précédent de cette formation (Praticien en Qigong Médical) je sais que c'est parfois compliqué de cumuler son travail et une formation en parallèle. Aujourd'hui je suis en mesure de réaliser cette nouvelle formation car :</p>
<ul>
<li> La passion pour le Qigong me permet d'avancer vers mon devenir.</li>
<li> Cette pratique me permet de tendre vers ce que je suis, de cultiver mon authenticité et d'apporter autour de moi une énergie inspirante.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> D'autres façons d'aider</h3>
<p> Mon projet vous plait, mais ne vous pouvez y contribuer financièrement.<br/>Vous pouvez malgré tout aider de cette manière :</p>
<ul>
<li> Passez le mot et de faites parler de mon projet autour de vous, à vos amis, collègues.</li>
<li> Utilisez les outils de partage Indiegogo pour partager sur vos réseaux Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin !</li>

J'ai pensé à des contreparties qui soient originales, et qui vous permettent de toucher un peu l'univers du Qigong. Vous pouvez les découvrir sur le côté droit de mon projet.
Si je ne récole pas la totalité du montant, j'utiliserai ce que j'ai pu obtenir pour financer ma formation. Les fonds récoltés serviront uniquement à ce projet qui touche au Qigong.

 L'impact
En soutenant mon projet et en faisant une contribution vous ferez la différence et me permettrez d'être utile aux autres :

 En inculquant par le Qigong les principes d'une vie plus saine et équilibrée.
 En permettant de pousser la philosophie du Qigong au sein des entreprises, afin que l'Humain y ait une place prédominante.

Dialekta, l'agence marketing où je travaille est le meilleur exemple que je puisse prendre, nous sommes ouverts à un bien-être des personnes qui travaillent, en proposant des massages sur chaise, de la méditation, et bientôt du Qigong !

 Risques et défis
 Après avoir fait le niveau précédent de cette formation (Praticien en Qigong Médical) je sais que c'est parfois compliqué de cumuler son travail et une formation en parallèle. Aujourd'hui je suis en mesure de réaliser cette nouvelle formation car :

 La passion pour le Qigong me permet d'avancer vers mon devenir.
 Cette pratique me permet de tendre vers ce que je suis, de cultiver mon authenticité et d'apporter autour de moi une énergie inspirante.


 D'autres façons d'aider
 Mon projet vous plait, mais ne vous pouvez y contribuer financièrement.Vous pouvez malgré tout aider de cette manière :

 Passez le mot et de faites parler de mon projet autour de vous, à vos amis, collègues.

Nile’s Edge is officially partnering with the historical landmark the Dr. James and Janie Washington Cultural Center, also known as The Washington House. Dr. James Washington Jr. was a world renowned painter and sculpture artist that rose in popularity to the likes of such artists as Jacob Lawrence. It is the only black owned registered historical landmark in the city of Seattle. In 1992, Dr. James Washington had the foresight to protect the decades of art he had created in his home studio by registering the home and all of its artifacts as a historical landmark to be used for the continued advancement of black people in Seattle.

Nile’s Edge would like to renovate their garden to its original glory with an additional focus on medicinal herbs and meditative spaces.

In gut-wrenching moments we reminded each other of our capacity to rise up from the ashes, and when one was seduced by an old destructive pattern the other would invite the one back down to earth and home to self.

We appreciate you and your contributions. The Divinatrix Archetype Deck is on it’s way to you!Now that the campaign is over, please visit us at our website divinatrix.world and on instagram @divinatrix_world.  The Divinatrix Archetype DeckIt’s been a long road. We’ve worked The Divinatrix Way and the way works. Now we’re ready to share it with you and your community. You can support us in launching Divinatrix by purchasing the archetype deck(s) and/or one of our other offerings, and by spreading the word. Please share! CHECK OUT DIVINATRIX art and The Archetype Deck in the windows of abc carpet&home!!! What is The Divinatrix Archetype Deck?⚬ A provocative new system of self-inquiry⚬ Like the Tarot, Divinatrix is a deck of guiding cards that help you disrupt your patterns and discover hidden aspects of yourself ⚬ A tool to accept and integrate the light and shadow of 7 major feminine archetypal energies ⚬ 7 archetypes, 42 cards, and 1 guide to exploring yourself and the dynamics in your lifeThe root Our friendship! A 30-year friendship that began on our first day of College. Playmates, soulmates, soul-sisters. The heart The love and trust we’ve shared over decades are truly the heart of this project. We witnessed, honored and mirrored countless aspects of each other without judgement. This support helped us to see ourselves more honestly and accept ourselves more deeply. Our mutual loving bluntness (that at times felt ruthless) was always tempered with unforgettable laughter and deep care. In gut-wrenching moments we reminded each other of our capacity to rise up from the ashes, and when one was seduced by an old destructive pattern the other would invite the one back down to earth and home to self. Together we learned to stay in vital circulation, spiraling toward more present, grounded, and fully expressed selves. The realizationThen our supernatural cocreative chemistry kicked in! We realized that we wanted to share the benefits of this experience with others...and so The Divinatrix Way was sparked.The result Through radical trust and in the spirit of curiosity and commitment we developed a system using the light and shadow aspects of 7 major feminine archetypes: The Innocent, The Lover, The Huntress, The Mother, The Queen, The Sage, and The Mystic. The system inspires honesty and inquiry into your relationship with yourself and the world. Each archetype serves as a quintessential anchor to an essential part of you. The side note The archetypes are universal approximations of shared experiences and common projections. Our individual realities are highly nuanced and personal. We offer these archetypes as anchors from which to explore the subtleties of your unique lived experience. Our mission To make the unconscious conscious. We strive to serve and support others through the creation of meaningful tools and content that are accessible to anyone who’s curious.Why are we raising money?⚬  To cover printing costs for the first edition of The Divinatrix Archetype Deck⚬  Any additional money will go toward building our website, a platform for sharing articles and information around the topics of empowerment, wellness, psychology, spirituality, creativity, philosophy, and social justice; a second round of printing; and the production of other Divinatrix goodies. Connect⚬  Explore our website: divinatrix.world⚬  Follow us on instagram: @divinatrix_world ⚬  Find us in stores (April 2021): abchome.com⚬  Email us to schedule a 1:1 reading or session: info@divinatix.worldWe are so excited to be embarking on this next leg of the journey.

<p>Slipp is a sexual wellness company creating condoms for women-first. We deliver condoms discreetly to your door, so you can avoid the awkward trip to the condom aisle.</p>
<p>Through discussions about our personal struggles with birth control, we've realized that many women feel awkward buying condoms; don't carry condoms with them; and even feel uncomfortable enforcing the use of a condom.</p>
<p>We noticed that the condoms on the market focus primarily on male pleasure and don't address women's sexual health. </p>
<p>Slipp condoms will be made with natural rubber latex and 100% silicone oil lubricant. We seek the best quality ingredients to avoid any irritants and to achieve vaginal comfort and health.</p>
<p>Our mission is to inspire women to feel comfortable buying, carrying, and using condoms in an effort to improve reproductive health. </p>

The mama thing is definitely the most demanding role I’ve ever had to play and one that I am learning how to embrace more each day. Like most mothers I’m often pulled in many directions at once and it’s hard to feel grounded and in touch with my own needs.I often will go, go, go until the coffee runs out or a I simply crash.And this, as we know, isn’t good for anyone!How can I be there for my family, friends, and community if I can’t pick myself up off the ground?I’ve been told the solution is self-care. To take plenty of ‘me’ time and eat well. Which all sounds great but also boring and difficult. Why should taking care of myself feel like work?What I want is…
Clean products that make me feel beautiful
Activities that inspire my creativity
To play and have fun
To build a sisterhood 
Support in taking time for myself
And no extra work
It seems crazy even writing that out because in the past we would have to go away somewhere, or cobble together a bunch of different solutions, all of which feels like work. Till now…The MUMBOX: your retreat delivered. It's a quarterly subscription box but more. It's not only filled with high-quality products, that I've personally selected, there are online resources like yoga and movement, guided meditations, journal exercises and more. To build the sisterhood and bring the tribe together we encourage the use of hashtags and social sharing. Plus there are tools to help you ask for the time and support you need to enjoy your MUMBOX. The best part...it gets delivered to your doorstep. No more over priced chocolates and flowers. This Mother's Day spread a little love and joy by purchasing a MUMBOX for yourself or a loved one. PS...they're designed for mamas but there's plenty of goodies that every woman will love.  So why the indiegogo campaign? Although I have the contents of the first box mapped out I need your help.  (See below for what's in the box).There are 200 boxes that will be available in time for Mother's Day. Every box purchased will go towards fulfillment and production of that box. This means even if the campaign is not fully funded, those who purchased a box, will get a box. Every dollar backed above $10,000 will go towards creating an enriching experience from start to finish. The online shop, content, and community will all benefit from your contribution. And because the MUMBOX isn't for everyone you can check out all the other cool perks available (updated throughout the campaign). You don't have to be a mother to make a statement that #mamasmatter. What exactly is in the MUMBOX?There are five main components of the MUMBOX. The welcome pack, self reflection, self realization, self actualization, and self expression. Each will be packaged with products, online and offline activities and tools to support you on your journey of self. Explore your MUMBOX.  Our initial theme: #mamalove includes...Welcome pack:Get started.In the box:Quarterly #mumboss zine, chocolate, Beauty Dust from Moon Juice and air plant.On the web:Creating sacred space.View video on MUMBOX Welcome kit. Self- Reflection:Pause, invite stillness. In the box:Figs and feathers Farm bath soaks, simply curated travel candle, sage stick, and other goodies in a reusable bag. On the web: Heart opening meditation Video on Self Reflection KitSelf Realization:Receive insight, propel ahead. In the box: mantraband and gratitude journal with a le pen. On the web: Tunes and activities Self Actualization:Create ritual, be change. In the box: lotuswei love spray and Figs and Feathers Farm lip tints, plus other goodies in a reusable bag. On the web: heart opening yoga poses Self Expression:Celebrate life.

<h3>G3 Delivery's WHY? </h3>
<p>We have a problem!!! It is super easy to eat fast food and almost impossible to eat fresh food. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508703890/wiedxxb5sfmup0ggtcv7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Because of this problem we have widespread hunger and obesity. </li>
<li>As of today, it can be very difficult to find fresh food at grocery stores and local markets.</li>
<li>And even if that food looks fresh, most of it comes from non-organic mono cultures some of which can even use GMOs, colors, and preservatives in order for the produce to maintain the same ""good looking"" color and shape even after several days. </li>
</ul>
<p>That's why we want to create G3 Delivery, an efficient and convenient way to have fresh produce delivered to your doorstep quick as a click.</p>
</div><div>
<div>
<h3>How It Works </h3>
<p>So we are sure you are curious to how such an amazing service works so here it is, </p>
<ol>
<li>First thing's first.<ul><li>It all starts with you. You order a G3 Delivery Fresh food baggy on Indiegogo, The G3 Delivery Website or G3 Delivery App (coming soon). </li></ul>

<p> </p>
<h3>Bag4Bag</h3>
<p>Our goal is to help anybody get fresh food delivered at their doorstep, that includes also all of those families who don't have the resources to afford to buy fresh food. That's why we're launching a revolutionary program called <strong>Bag4Bag</strong><i>. </i>Through this program<i>, for every bag that is ordered through our website or app, another bag full of food will be donated to a family in need.</i> Automatically! So as soon as you purchase your bag of food to cook your dinner, you've already helped another family have access to a meal for the night. When are you enacting Bag4Bag? The answer is RIGHT NOW!<strong> For every bag you buy through our Indiegogo perks, another bag will be donated and you will receive a picture with the family you helped as proof.</strong></p>

<li>If we don't hit our goal we're still going to use all the funding received to give everybody's perks</li>

The objective of Heirloom is to foster community health, making healthy lifestyles accessible and fun.</p>
<ul>

<li>The founders of Heirloom support youth education and will expose our youth to the benefits of an organically fueled diet. They will have hands on learning experiences on balanced nutrition including juicing, superfoods and cooking techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>More about the businesses involved</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Pittsburgh Juice Company</strong></p>
<p>When the Pittsburgh Juice Company (PJC) launched its flagship organic juicery in Lawrenceville in 2014, one of the goals was to make organic produce and superfoods more accessible to the surrounding neighborhoods. Four years later, Heirloom Superfood Market represents this goal coming to fruition... and so much more!</p>
<p>Over the years PJC has formed alliances with many admirable health-focused food businesses. We are all driven by the same passion for creating nourishing food from wholesome, organic ingredients. By working together we share resources, knowledge and expertise, while also building a strong community.</p> <p><strong>Pure Grub</strong></p>
<p>Pure grub uses only sustainable, regionally sourced, naturally grown and organic ingredients to provide the community with foods devoid of inflammatory agents and opioids. All products are also free of gluten, dairy and processed sugar. With a small research team comprised of alumni of the National University of Natural Medicine, Pure Grub creates meals that replenish and balance the body by using the appropriate amounts of fat, fiber, protein and macronutrients.</p> <p><strong>Frontier Cultures</strong></p>
<p>Frontier Cultures produces raw vinegar infusions that aim to bolster the body's immune system and improve digestive health. Their signature Master Tonic offers a fiery blend of roots and peppers that promote the growth of beneficial gut flora, aid in circulation, and fight against colds and flus. The infusion can especially benefit individuals who struggle with gluten issues, IBS, ""leaky gut,"" or other stomach sensitivities.  Each small batch is made by infusing raw organic apple cider vinegar with raw and organic horseradish root, ginger root, onion, garlic, turmeric root, jalapeno, habanero, rosemary, and grapefruit zest over the course of several weeks.</p> <p><strong>Fickle Fox Fermented Foods</strong></p>
<p>Fickle Fox Fermented Foods was born of a desire to help people thrive on their health journey while still being able to indulge in something delicious. They believe good food is something that should bring people together regardless of dietary choices. Fickle Fox uses all organic and minimally processed ingredients and they get creative with the method. The results are unique batches of dairy free and grain free cashew based ""yogurt"" in foxy flavors like Blueberry Cardamom, Raspberry with Chocolate Ganache, and Coconut Banana Caramel Chip.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need to Make Heirloom a Reality</h3>
<p>Heirloom Superfood Market already has a secure physical presence at The Pittsburgh Juice Company’s commissary on the corner of 31st Street and Penn Avenue.  The space was formerly a rock and roll pub now undergoing a transformation into a bright health food haven.  All proceeds raised throughout the campaign will help to expedite the improvements necessary to open Heirloom’s doors and make whole, organic foods, produce and hard to find items available in the Strip District every day.  Funds will be put toward the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plumbing: hand sink, 3 bowl sink, mop sink</li>
<li>Storefront Remodel on Penn Ave and 31st Street</li>
<li>Interior Paint</li>
<li>Lighting Improvements</li>
<li>Shelving</li>
<li>Inventory</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lawrenceville and the Upper Strip District and surrounding neighborhoods are often referred to as food deserts, where residents are forced to either</p>
<ul>
<li>leave their neighborhoods to buy groceries</li>
<li>grocery shop at convenience stores</li>
<li>rely upon fast food or restaurant food</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the US Department of Agriculture, people who live in food deserts have a higher rate of obesity, diabetes, and other food-related diseases than those who have easy and ready access to abundant food.  While the Central Strip District offers a variety of bulk ethnic foods, an organic health food market is something that does not exist anywhere in the surrounding area.  Because The Pittsburgh Juice Company already keeps an array of bulk superfoods and produce in stock for their own ingredients, Heirloom Superfood Market is a logical step in their business development and also toward neighborhood vitality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pioneers of the Upper Strip District</h3>
<p>Heirloom Superfood Market is located in the middle of two booming neighborhoods: Lawrenceville and the Central Strip District, with easy access to Route 28 from the 31st Street Bridge.  By activating the 31st Street corridor we will be taking a step toward joining these neighborhoods.  When the Pittsburgh Juice Company opened four years ago (three blocks from Heirloom) Lower Lawrenceville was experiencing a similar shift toward become more densely populated and pedestrian friendly.  With Heirloom we are excited to provide another anchor in the growth and development of this thriving neighborhood.</p>

This means I'll be giving away most of my possessions and the best ones will be offered up here as perks for contributing to this campaign.Thank you for reading this and any help is welcome,Phil",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Yellow Mat's Manifesto + Mission</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Manifesto</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We believe in the power of yoga<br/>and we believe in the goodness of people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are so certain that yoga works that we will open<br/>our doors freely to all who make their way, regardless of<br/>age, race, color, creed, religion, sexual orientation, <br/>gender identity, citizenship, or physical and mental ability.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We believe that yoga should be available to all of the people,<br/>regardless of cultural, political, or economic differences.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We believe that yoga unifies communities <br/>and it is through the acceptance of all people that we can be <br/>an example of real change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We believe that your clothes don't make you better, <br/>neither does your car or your job, </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But the simple act of showing up completely <br/>in a place of acceptance makes your <br/>humanity shine brilliantly. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MISSION</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Yellow Mat Yoga will empower radical personal and social change by supporting the physical, mental, emotional, and energetic well-being and well-doing of every breathing human. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>All of them.</i></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Yellow Mat Yoga does not seek to be a business, but must pursue business activities in order to provide the resources necessary to share the practice of yoga. We pay to rent and maintain a beautiful, safe space, we compensate our teachers for their time and expertise, and we provide support to the causes that affect our community and resonate with our mission.</p>
<p>We do believe yoga should be as affordable as possible. So we call on you, our loved ones, to give generously and strive to ease the financial burden to those often need yoga the most.</p>
<p>All funds raised during this campaign will go towards building the studio infrastructure and establishing an inclusive yoga community.</p>
<p>To sustain our work, we intend to function as a multi-purpose space: Special Events, Retreats, Workshops, Community Gatherings will be an important part of the studio.</p>
<p>We will operate as a membership-based studio, so we can use the power of collective economics to offer free- and low-cost classes, as well as studio scholarships to ease the financial burden for students in need. As with any small business, there are several start-up costs associated with opening. We have already invested substantial funds into the prep and build out of the space.  With your support, we will be able to hit the ground running with a full schedule of classes, teachers, and opportunities for community fellowship and growth.</p>
<p>YELLOW MATS – of course! While students are welcome to practice on any mat they choose, we provide yellow mats for members and to host community classes within and outside the studio. Our gently used mats are gifted to students who wish to continue their home practice.</p>
<p>PROPS - As we strive to be an inclusive yoga community, a variety of props such as blocks, blankets, wedges, bolsters will help students enjoy an accessible practice, regardless of ability or previous experience.</p>
<p>TECH/ADMIN SUPPORT - to run a smooth and efficient studio, we’re taken care to source great class management software and technology resources.</p>
<p>GENERAL OUTDOOR MAINTENENCE - we have beautiful outdoor area that we plan to open to the community in the spring. We need help beautifying the space with lights and greenery.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We will also have a small retail section for props, yoga-wear, and books to support your yoga studies and home practice.</p>
<p>None of these aspects on their own is cheap, but taken together they become truly costly.  </p>
<p>The goal of Yellow Mat Yoga is to become an efficient, generous, self-sustaining entity. We ask for your love and support on this journey.</p>

<p>We're offering a wide variety of perks so you can try out the studio and see the exciting programming Yellow Mat is planning for 2018.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tracey Jewel, and together with Wellstrong Collective we are raising funds to develop a mental health support app for Women.</p>
<p>Personally, I’d never experienced anxiety or mental health challenges before appearing on the Reality TV program Married At First Sight last year but a combination of factors led to me battling terrible anxiety. After a year of therapies I have found many tools and skills that help me overcome my anxiety.</p>
<p>Through this journey I have realised how isolating and debilitating mental health can be.</p>
<p>Which is why I became an accredited Mental Health First Aid instructor and completing a diploma of mental health.</p>
<p>Together with Wellstrong Collectives beautiful range of Wellness products, I’m extremely passionate about creating an app to assist women and their mental well-being through four key areas focusing on happiness, energy, sleep and mindfulness.</p>
<p>Mental health apps can be effective in making therapy more accessible, efficient, and portable.<br/><br/>With your help and donations through purchasing our inspiring new range of wellness products and our experts who are assisting us developing this Wellshop app, we can help the 1 in 6 Women who will experience Depression and 1 in 3 Women who will experience Anxiety in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Donate to one of the following perk packages below to receive some beautiful products, Wellness Workshop services and all contributions get to access the app upon completion too!</p>

<p>For years, Texas NORML and Texans for Responsible Marijuana Policy have been working to give patients access to medical marijuana in Texas and reduce penalties for low-level possession.</p>
<p><strong>A Window of Opportunity This Spring</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we have strong bipartisan support for reform in the Texas Legislature and a record setting number of bills have been introduced for consideration. There’s a very small window to make this happen before the session ends in May.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Get These Laws Across the Finish Line in 2019!</strong><br/> <br/>We’ve heard from thousands of Texas veterans, people with cancer or chronic pain, and other debilitating medical conditions who are suffering.  </p>
<p>And, chances are, you know many, too. It’s just wrong that families have to travel out of state to find relief through medical marijuana. It’s time to give Texans medical freedom without having to uproot their families.  And we are very close to making this a reality in this current legislative session, which ends May 27th.</p>
<p><strong>Your Donations Will Work Hard to Get These Laws Passed</strong></p>
<p>Your donation will be split between <a href=""https://www.texasnorml.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Texas NORML</a> and <a href=""http://www.texasmarijuanapolicy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Texans for Responsible Marijuana Policy.</a> These two groups are led by well-known and respected advocates for individual liberty, and personal responsibility around marijuana laws in Texas. Jax Finkel is the Executive Director of Texas NORML and has been involved in cannabis law reform since 2005.  Heather Fazio leads Texans for Responsible Marijuana Policy and has worked in this arena for ten years.  Both are familiar faces at the Capitol who have worked tirelessly to inform and build coalitions with our Texas lawmakers to create fair and compassionate marijuana laws.</p>
<p>These two groups collaborate closely with others that span the political spectrum, but share a value of freedom for Texans to get fair and compassionate marijuana legislation passed.</p>
<p>These include the Tenth Amendment Center, Texans for Accountable Government, Texas Young Republicans, Texas Criminal Justice Coalition, Students for Sensible Drug Policy, Students for Liberty, the Republican Liberty Caucus of Texas, Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition, the Reason Foundation, Progress Texas, the Marijuana Policy Project, the Libertarian Party of Texas, Libertarian Christians, Law Enforcement Action Partnership, Clergy for a New Drug Policy, the Austin Justice Coalition and ACLU Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Your donation ensures we can deliver these critical action items for this current session:</strong></p>
<p>• Lobbying of state legislators, regulatory agencies &amp; community leaders</p>
<p>• Effective grassroots mobilization &amp; coalition building</p>
<p>•  Education and media outreach </p>
<p><br/><strong>Why Access to Medical Marijuana is So Crucial</strong></p>
<p>Medical marijuana often relieves chronic pain and increases the quality of life for people with PTSD, cancer, autism and other debilitating conditions without harmful side effects.             <br/>Too many patients are needlessly suffering.</p>
<p>Additionally, in states where access to medical marijuana is legal, opioid deaths have declined by 20% the first year following approval. Solid proof that access to medical marijuana <i>is saving lives.</i> </p>
<p>It’s time to make a change in our law so Texans have safe and legal access to medical marijuana!</p>
<p><strong>Thank YOU</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for making Texas a more compassionate place. And thank you for supporting this work and helping us get this legislation passed. With your donation, we will make Texas a more compassionate place to call home.</p>
<p><br/>Big THANKS to Jason Rink and Keith Wahrer with Dig Deep Films and Shaun McAlister with iamshaun.com! </p>

<p>The Impact: Addressing ACEs</p>
<p>In recent years, the concept of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) has been a hot topic when it comes to child development and the well-being of a community. Experiences like incarceration of a family member, mental illness or substance abuse in the home, and abuse of any kind have a direct impact on the life outcomes of the children who experience them.</p>
<p>The number of ACEs a child endures correlates directly to an increased risk of many diseases and causes of early death. Children in Shasta County experience more ACEs than most children in the state.</p>
<p>Shasta county has some of the highest ACE statistics in the state. Here are a few of the statistics</p>
<p>17.1 % Have an incarcerated family member </p>
<p>29.7% Have witnessed domestic violence</p>
<p>54.5 % Have experienced verbal abuse</p>
<p>57.7 % Have experienced family substance abuse</p>
<p>The good news is that kids who experience these things CAN heal and have a bright future.  In addition to healing, studies have shown that there are some specific protective factors against the impact of ACEs in a community. </p>
<p>Roam Playspace will directly address ACEs through the protective factors of: </p>
<p>Social Connections: Roam will be a place where families can connect, create, and strengthen the social connections that are integral for strong families and communities </p>
<p>Knowledge of parenting practices and childhood development: Opt- in workshops at Roam Playspace will come from a variety of community voices and focus on many aspects of parenting and development </p>
<p>Social and emotional competence in children: Learning to interact with and navigate relationships to other children and adults is key to a child's development, and this happens naturally through open-ended play. </p>
<p>About the Founders</p>
<p>Alan and Anna have been on the parenting journey for 5 years and on a personal level have seen the force of a parenting community,  the lifeline of experts to support during challenges, and the power of intentional play. </p>
<p>Alan studied medicine with an emphasis on the low-income families of Appalachia. He has been a physician assistant for 8 years, and he especially enjoys connecting with kids in the ER. He has worked mostly in emergency medicine, with some of that time in the ER of a children's hospital.  He feels honored to be connected to a community of people addressing child development and ACEs in Redding.</p>
<p>Anna was trained as a life coach in 2007 and has been a practicing doula since 2013. She has developed materials that guide women in utilizing the experiences of pregnancy, birthing, postpartum, and early motherhood as a catalyst for their own personal and parenting growth.  Anna saw the power of play and movement in trauma recovery  using swim and art therapy with children who lost their parents in the 2004 tsunami. She leads an international team that resources people in emotional and physical wholeness.</p>
<p>Alan and Anna are consulting with a team of individuals who are incredible thinkers and practioners in the areas of play, the use of space, child development, parent resourcing, healing, and community needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>We love consulting with experts in the fields of childhood development, fun, parenting, and child-directed play. We are also creating a line up of workshops with a variety of voices. Be in touch if you would like to be involved! </p>

The Impact: Addressing ACEs
In recent years, the concept of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) has been a hot topic when it comes to child development and the well-being of a community. Experiences like incarceration of a family member, mental illness or substance abuse in the home, and abuse of any kind have a direct impact on the life outcomes of the children who experience them.
The number of ACEs a child endures correlates directly to an increased risk of many diseases and causes of early death. Children in Shasta County experience more ACEs than most children in the state.
Shasta county has some of the highest ACE statistics in the state. Here are a few of the statistics
17.1 % Have an incarcerated family member 
29.7% Have witnessed domestic violence
54.5 % Have experienced verbal abuse
57.7 % Have experienced family substance abuse
The good news is that kids who experience these things CAN heal and have a bright future.  In addition to healing, studies have shown that there are some specific protective factors against the impact of ACEs in a community. 
Roam Playspace will directly address ACEs through the protective factors of: 
Social Connections: Roam will be a place where families can connect, create, and strengthen the social connections that are integral for strong families and communities 
Knowledge of parenting practices and childhood development: Opt- in workshops at Roam Playspace will come from a variety of community voices and focus on many aspects of parenting and development 
Social and emotional competence in children: Learning to interact with and navigate relationships to other children and adults is key to a child's development, and this happens naturally through open-ended play.

<p><b>One World Wellness's Mission:</b></p>
<p><b>Our
intention is to travel around the globe, to wherever our assistance is needed, to support
everyday people to take their health, wellness and level of joy to an
all-time high. It's no secret that our world is struggling as a whole. <br/>We feel that every single person who becomes healthy, self-empowered and balanced is one more person who will tip the scales toward a positive tomorrow for all of us and future generations.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Our
preliminary research project....in a nutshell:</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">After
6 months of traveling in our car from Vancouver Island to Guatemala
and back again on a small budget, and connecting with many dozens of
people from all walks of life, we have realized something HUGE: <i>Most
of us do NOT have the time or extra finances to take a “wellness
vacation” or retreat.</i> However, almost <i>everyone </i>we connect with has
a desire to feel more joy, live a healthier lifestyle and to have the
support to fuel their passions. <i>Wow! How do we solve this dilemma?</i></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>GOOD
NEWS! We have a solution:</b></p>
<p><i>One
World Wellness</i> will bring the wellness retreat and personal guidance
<i>right to your home!</i> We are a mobile, flexible team with knowledge to
share with you about healthy lifestyle shifts, spiritual exploration and how
to expand your consciousness to assist you in creating the vibrant
and joyful life that you dream of living! We will offer the
support needed to the people who need it the most. </p>
<p><b>What can One World Wellness offer to our students?</b></p>
<p>Our services may include: shifting to healthier eating, moving our bodies, healthier thinking
and heart-centered communication, deepening spiritual practices, growing your own food, improving the quality of your surroundings...and the possibilities go on and on. We can
work with you at your own pace to guide you toward your personal path
to greater joy and wellness. Keep us around for a week or ask us for
a month of our time. The amount of support required for each individual will vary.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Who
is One World Wellness?</b></p>
<p>We
are <i>Kristin and Tanner</i>. A happy-go-lucky, upbeat, vibrant, 30-ish
couple who's mission it is to continue to live simply and joyfully
while supporting others in finding their own joy though balancing body, mind and
spirit. Our passion is to show others that it's possible to live a
vibrant and joyful life every single day!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
began <i>One World Wellness</i> in the fall of 2014 while we were living on
Vancouver Island. We had both worked many ""<i>normal</i>"" careers
(both for ourselves and for employers) in the last decade. We were
feeling downright unfulfilled and way too tired and stressed at age 30! <i>Hmmmm. How can we work so darn hard and only make such a tiny
difference in our world? Why aren't we following our own passions
instead of someone else's? Are we answering our greatest calling on
the planet? What if we just forget the naysayers and just do what we
love?! </i>Well that's what we are doing starting right now! Help us to
help our world to thrive.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What
will the Funding that we receive from this campaign pay for?</b></p>
<p>Our
vision is to offer our services to people on a sliding scale. At the
end of our stay at each home, we will give each person or family the
opportunity to make a donation to<i> One World Wellness</i> to assist us in continuing our work as
a mobile wellness team.  Some will be able to give more than others
and under NO circumstances do we want to deny our services to anyone
that truly needs them. It will be a pay-it-forward type of system.
Every little bit of funding we receive will assist us in extending the life of this
project! :)</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How will you know where the money is getting spent?</b><br/></p>
<p>We write a blog each week about our experiences and adventures and the amazing connections that we make with people like you. You will be able to see what we are up to and where we are spending the money that is so generously donated to our project.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Your
donations may go toward things that will make our project
sustainable, such as:</b></p>
<p>Books
and other teaching materials for our team and students</p>
<p>We are in need of a smaller, more portable (and less ancient than our huge laptop) device for making videos and communicating with our students. iPad?</p>
<p>Purchasing
minor health and wellness products to support clients (ex: gardening
supplies, yoga mats, sports equipment, etc.)</p>
<p>Rentals
of venues for wellness events, workshops, etc.</p>
<p>Fuel
to get our team and our car to our next student(s)</p>
<p>Routine
and/or unexpected repairs/maintenance for our aging OOW car (if/when
needed...hopefully minimal!)</p>
<p>Travel
Insurance (a necessity for out-of-Canada travels)</p>
<p>*If our fundraising goes <i>exceptionally </i>well, we would love to upgrade our 2003 Jetta to a larger vehicle (such as a van or small motor home) so that we may have a place to lay our heads between students, as well as haul larger items, such as a massage table and other healing tools.</p>

intention is to travel around the globe, to wherever our assistance is needed, to support
everyday people to take their health, wellness and level of joy to an
all-time high. It's no secret that our world is struggling as a whole. We feel that every single person who becomes healthy, self-empowered and balanced is one more person who will tip the scales toward a positive tomorrow for all of us and future generations.



Our
preliminary research project....in a nutshell:
After
6 months of traveling in our car from Vancouver Island to Guatemala
and back again on a small budget, and connecting with many dozens of
people from all walks of life, we have realized something HUGE: Most
of us do NOT have the time or extra finances to take a “wellness
vacation” or retreat. However, almost everyone we connect with has
a desire to feel more joy, live a healthier lifestyle and to have the
support to fuel their passions. Wow! How do we solve this dilemma?


GOOD
NEWS! We have a solution:
One
World Wellness will bring the wellness retreat and personal guidance
right to your home! We are a mobile, flexible team with knowledge to
share with you about healthy lifestyle shifts, spiritual exploration and how
to expand your consciousness to assist you in creating the vibrant
and joyful life that you dream of living! We will offer the
support needed to the people who need it the most. 
What can One World Wellness offer to our students?
Our services may include: shifting to healthier eating, moving our bodies, healthier thinking
and heart-centered communication, deepening spiritual practices, growing your own food, improving the quality of your surroundings...and the possibilities go on and on. We can
work with you at your own pace to guide you toward your personal path
to greater joy and wellness. Keep us around for a week or ask us for
a month of our time. The amount of support required for each individual will vary.


Who
is One World Wellness?
We
are Kristin and Tanner. A happy-go-lucky, upbeat, vibrant, 30-ish
couple who's mission it is to continue to live simply and joyfully
while supporting others in finding their own joy though balancing body, mind and
spirit. Our passion is to show others that it's possible to live a
vibrant and joyful life every single day!


We
began One World Wellness in the fall of 2014 while we were living on
Vancouver Island. We had both worked many ""normal"" careers
(both for ourselves and for employers) in the last decade. We were
feeling downright unfulfilled and way too tired and stressed at age 30! Hmmmm. How can we work so darn hard and only make such a tiny
difference in our world? Why aren't we following our own passions
instead of someone else's? Are we answering our greatest calling on
the planet? What if we just forget the naysayers and just do what we
love?! Well that's what we are doing starting right now! Help us to
help our world to thrive.


What
will the Funding that we receive from this campaign pay for?
Our
vision is to offer our services to people on a sliding scale. At the
end of our stay at each home, we will give each person or family the
opportunity to make a donation to One World Wellness to assist us in continuing our work as
a mobile wellness team.  Some will be able to give more than others
and under NO circumstances do we want to deny our services to anyone
that truly needs them. It will be a pay-it-forward type of system.
Every little bit of funding we receive will assist us in extending the life of this
project! :)
How will you know where the money is getting spent?
We write a blog each week about our experiences and adventures and the amazing connections that we make with people like you. You will be able to see what we are up to and where we are spending the money that is so generously donated to our project.
Read Our Blog Here!


Your
donations may go toward things that will make our project
sustainable, such as:
Books
and other teaching materials for our team and students
We are in need of a smaller, more portable (and less ancient than our huge laptop) device for making videos and communicating with our students. iPad?
Purchasing
minor health and wellness products to support clients (ex: gardening
supplies, yoga mats, sports equipment, etc.)
Rentals
of venues for wellness events, workshops, etc.
Fuel
to get our team and our car to our next student(s)
Routine
and/or unexpected repairs/maintenance for our aging OOW car (if/when
needed...hopefully minimal!)
Travel
Insurance (a necessity for out-of-Canada travels)
*If our fundraising goes exceptionally well, we would love to upgrade our 2003 Jetta to a larger vehicle (such as a van or small motor home) so that we may have a place to lay our heads between students, as well as haul larger items, such as a massage table and other healing tools.

TESTIMONIALS...
""Some people you just really wish were your neighbors. Theses guys just jump right into your life and make you glad to be alive. Welcome back into my world anytime."" - Kent, Idaho, USA
""Tanner and Kristin are such positive, high-spirited people! We had some of the best conversations and they spread the most amazing energy and enthusiasm to me in their entire stay. I think Tanner has changed my life with his drumming ceremony and I will never forget anything about them!!!!!!"" - Kristine, Oregon, USA
""What a pleasure to be a last-minute host for these two. When I think of them, the words that come to mind are balanced, grounded, engaged and respectful. I highly enjoyed my brief time with them and totally recommend you open your doors to them if you have the opportunity. All the best in all you do Kristin and Tanner. You are the kind of young(er) people that give me some hope for the survivability of this planet."" - Carol, Florida, USA
""The thing I appreciate the most about Tanner and Kristin is that they walk the talk."" - Dave, British Columbia, Canada / Mexico
""I did the cacao ceremony just out of curiosity. I didn't have any expectations. I just wanted to see what it would be like and what it's about. It was a really interesting experience and it was also very therapeutic. It was also really beautiful.  I'm really grateful to Kristin and Tanner, not just for doing the ceremonies, but for being the right people to host them because that makes all the difference."" - Deb, New York, USA

<p><b>Hello, thank you for reading, my Name is Kristinna Counsell, and I'm a disabled full time mummy to two daughters one of whom has a very rare cancer in her spine.</b></p>
<p>Pippi (Aged 10 nearly 11 years) was in and out of hospital early 2016 and had many tests and a small spinal operation before finally being diagnosed with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in a vertebrae in her spine at the end of April 2016.</p>
<p>We have watched our child become so sick before our eyes and felt so very helpless to heal her.  We were very lucky our oncologist respected our wishes to hold off on chemotherapy and steroids for as long as possible and explore every alternative first.</p>
<p>After many months on indomethicin and anti acids Pippi was still in a great deal of pain and added to that she was having intense headaches and being very sickly as the medications were burning her insides.  After another X-ray at the end of October 2016 showed there were no changes and increasing pain in her arm meant an inconclusive secondary site.  So, we took the decision to take her off all medication for a month and under the consultants permission we moved to try hemp oil.</p>
<p>Pippi started the hemp oil in November and moved onto cbd  oil in December.  We returned to the oncologist in January 2017 to have further X-rays and it is looking like the oil is working.  </p>
<p>Along with the oil we are maintaining an organic dairy and meat limited diet.  Pippi now has colour in her cheeks and seems to be blossoming.  She actually had a 1"" growth spurt over Christmas!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our oncologist has said no more medications, just the CBD oil.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose here is to ask you all to help us maintain this medicine and diet regime by helping fund the extra costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our daughter has been in more pain than usual these last 6 weeks but it appears that is due to the bone re growing itself and destroying the LCH mass.  There appears to be a 50% improvement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pippi has also now started to return to school and is managing 2-3 mornings a week.  I was working but due to Pippi needing me and my own increasing disability I've had to give that up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what are we asking from you?</p>
<ul>
<li>On going funding help so that we can maintain Pippi's diet and CBC oil regime which currently increases our weekly cost of living by around £100 a week;</li>
<li>Funding to enable us to install an at source water filtration system, currently we are buying copious amounts of bottled water.  The cost for this is anticipated to be around £1000.</li>
<li><p>Help to raise £395 to enable us to have her hair tested for analysis into her make up which will enable us to further compliment her diet to clear her system of the toxins that caused the cancer in the first place.</p></li>

<h3>Why You Ask?</h3>
<p>I'm 38 years old, and have been practicing yoga for two years.  After being afraid to take the steps, I finally decided to take a leap of faith (while still working a full-time job), and see where the Universe will take me on this new journey.  </p>
<p>I turned to yoga for a few reasons: to learn how to calm the chaos that my job as an Event Planner was bringing me to everyday, to help me cope with a constant of failures from going through a divorce to losing two jobs in less than a year, and to get in shape.   First I did use it as a fitness tool....I was taking 2 classes a day 5-6 days a week.  My mood was elevated, my body was getting into the best shape it ever was in, and my eating habits were improving just by how good I was feeling after each class.  It helped to lower my stress level from work, and when I would go home from taking a class after work, I was able to separate the two and keep the stress at bay.  I discovered that it also helped calm my mind, helped to show me it's okay to let the small stuff just roll off your back and improve my confidence with going through a divorce and dealing with the loss of two jobs in less than a year.  It showed me that whatever you put into the universe to help you create the life you want will come back to you in a positive way.  I love what it has done for my mind and my soul.   </p>
<p><br/>What I have learned on the mat has translated to teaching me life off the mat. I have become much more patient, grateful for everything and everyone around me, kind, and peaceful.  I have been able to become part of an amazing community of people with both diverse and similar thoughts, stories, and backgrounds, all the while having the same connection of our yoga practice.  It, and they, taught me to learn not to judge, taught me to just be me, and know that no matter who I am, I am accepted.  They taught me to see the inner strengths to get through any situation with my head held high, and find strengths I did not know I had.  <br/><br/>I want to complete yoga teacher training to not only deepen my practice, but to help others come to their mat and find what I have found.  I want to help others benefit from their experiences and benefit from their growth.  I want them to experience not only the physical aspects of yoga but the mental and emotional benefits as well that come from taking the time each day to dedicate to yourself on your mat, to practice mindfulness, gratitude and gratefulness, learning to breathe and be still, and experience true inner peace, even if it's just for 1 hour a day.  Yoga is a tool of transformation, and I want to be able to help everyone transform to be their best self.  </p>
<p>I also plan to host yoga events: using my event planning background and combining my love of yoga, I plan to dedicate a portion of those events to my favorite charities and involve the community.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What Do I Get Out of It:</h3>
<p>I am blessed to be a part of one of the top 200-Hour programs in the Valley, and after the courses are completed, I will be able to register as Yoga Alliance Certified.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What Do You Get Out of It?</h3>
<p>I will be receiving a comprehensive training in traditions that extend hundreds of thousands of years, and I am so looking forward to sharing that knowledge with you!  Take this opportunity to improve your own wellbeing, or that of your friends and family as well!  Grab a perk or two for yourself, or use as a gift for someone who you think would benefit from a yoga class or a private lesson (or two, or three!).   If you wish to donate without receiving a perk, truly any amount really does go a long way.  If you are not able to donate, please take a minute to share this opportunity with friends or family who might be interested in a class or private lesson via phone, email or even social media.</p>

<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>Thank you all for your support, love and belief in my journey.  It is coming full circle since I took my first yoga class two years ago.  It's never an easy thing to ask for money, but I hope to lean on my supportive community and those around me, and celebrate the generosity that I know exists in the Universe when we take care of each other.</p>

<p><strong>Change is in the Air: A New Chapter for NAAM Yoga AZ</strong> <br/><br/>""WE MUST BE WILLING TO LET GO OF THE LIFE WE HAVE PLANNED, SO AS TO HAVE THE LIFE THAT IS WAITING FOR US.""<br/><br/>As most of you know, our intent at Naam Yoga AZ has always been to stay and expand in a year or so in our existing University Drive location. However, the Universe seems to have a different plan for us.  <br/><br/>In all efforts to be transparent, we would like to share with you that in March, our landlord defaulted on his mortgage and our plaza went into foreclosure.  Since then, the plaza has been taken over by a bank.  We have been trying to negotiate a new lease for 2 months and the only option repeatedly offered to us was to sign a 3-year lease with a rent increase of almost 300% or vacate.  We have bought ourselves some time by sending counter proposals, however, we are now out of time and they are unwilling to negotiate further.  </p>
<p>In addition, we can’t find the benefit to staying and paying 300% more rent for a space that is not taken care of in a dying plaza, where we are not allowed to expand at some point. So, that leaves us with the option of moving.   This option, at the moment, also seems impossible because summer is our slowest season and the studio is not in a financial position to accrue the expenses of moving.  This then, leaves us with the final decision of either moving or closing, the latter which we do NOT want to do and has been tearing us up at the thought of it.</p>
<p>In search for a miracle, we have found a wonderful new location in a busy plaza on Higley and University, with a landlord that is willing to work with Naam Yoga AZ and takes our current situation into consideration.  It’s a great opportunity and we feel in our hearts, it is the right move and will bring abundant growth and success.  It will allow us to have multiple classes at the same time and also give Harmonyum Healing and other healing treatments at any time of the day because the treatment rooms are not in the actual studio.  The potential is endless at this new space and will allow us to serve a greater population, bringing even more healing to the residents of Mesa.</p>
<p>So, I am stepping out of my comfort zone…ALL THE WAY…and asking for help.  We are in the business of teaching Yoga.  Yoga is about clearing away whatever is in us that prevents our living in the most full and whole way.  With yoga, we become aware of how &amp; where we are restricted…and my greatest restriction is asking for help.  Therefore, if I am going to continue to teach and guide students, I must practice what I preach and let fear and ego go and trust the Plans the Universe has for me.</p>
<p>So, we am humbly reaching out to you, our beloved community, because we believe this center has made a difference in your lives.  We believe you understand the intention, purpose and passion for Naam Yoga and can perceive the vision for expansion to become a true healing center for the community.</p>
<p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500907790/x3cax4f5zppy2ahfz9ds.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>In order to relocate, and transform this miracle space into the new community home of our beloved Naam Yoga AZ, we need to raise funds in excess of $21,000. And with the magic we have witnessed within this community, we know just how possible this is.</p>
<p><strong>What is it for, you ask?  </strong></p>
<p>The funds will be used for the cost of moving our current studio and transforming the new studio itself, as well as business licenses, escrow, taxes, insurance, and a small savings to keep things moving smoothly through the first few months of this transition. </p>
<p>Any and all donation support for the Naam Yoga AZ Relocation will go <i>directly</i> into the project itself.  We will need to build out the new space and make it yoga worthy.</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions will help cover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>City fees and requirements</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building improvements and alterations: fixtures, build wood cubbies to store the yoga props, customize the reception desk</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contractor fees </strong></li>
<li><strong>General construction (installation of wood flooring, walls, paint, etc.)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Furniture and necessary furnishings</strong></li>
<li><strong>Additional yoga props </strong></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p>We are also looking to expand our community by adding more teachers to our schedule, a permanent Teacher training program, hire front desk staff, MindBody software for easier check in and scheduling, additional classes, workshops, a children's program, and a full time trauma &amp; recovery program.</p>
<p>Upon moving locations, <strong>Naam Yoga AZ will also be renamed NAAM YOGA ARIZONA CENTER FOR THE HEALING ARTS</strong>, using the power of the WORD to inform the Universe of our desire to expand and be of service in a greater way, becoming a beacon of God’s Healing Light in the community.  Through this relocation and expansion of Naam Yoga AZ, the tireless efforts of being of service will continue, offering not only a supportive and effective class timetable on site, but we will also endeavor to nourish our already established programs with children, seniors and the trauma/recovery community. With the stability of our new center, we are then able to be of service in our community of Mesa and beyond, building strong out-reach programs for childre,  teens, adults, elderly, physically challenged and more.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Yoga can change your life. We've seen it happen over and over. This practice allows people to develop a stronger sense of presence and realization of their potential. The world needs more Yoga! The world needs more Bliss!   This new space will make it possible for us to invite more people into our community, and to continue expanding the offerings that support our tribe and the affect yoga has on lives, community, and the world.  </p>
<p>Our desire is that Naam Yoga Arizona Center for the Healing Arts will be a Sanctuary of Peace, providing personal guidance, personal transformation, complete well-being, community connection, spiritual and metaphysical education, spiritual development – EMPOWERMENT.  Our wish is that Naam Yoga AZ be a nurturing haven, a place for people to come together for inspiration, creation and service – to raise consciousness toward balance and healing. Balanced and harmonious individuals create stable families and stable families become viable members in their community and society as a whole. It does take a village to change the world!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE ALL IN IT TOGETHER!</h3>

</div></div>","Change is in the Air: A New Chapter for NAAM Yoga AZ ""WE MUST BE WILLING TO LET GO OF THE LIFE WE HAVE PLANNED, SO AS TO HAVE THE LIFE THAT IS WAITING FOR US.""As most of you know, our intent at Naam Yoga AZ has always been to stay and expand in a year or so in our existing University Drive location. However, the Universe seems to have a different plan for us.  In all efforts to be transparent, we would like to share with you that in March, our landlord defaulted on his mortgage and our plaza went into foreclosure.  Since then, the plaza has been taken over by a bank.  We have been trying to negotiate a new lease for 2 months and the only option repeatedly offered to us was to sign a 3-year lease with a rent increase of almost 300% or vacate.  We have bought ourselves some time by sending counter proposals, however, we are now out of time and they are unwilling to negotiate further.  
In addition, we can’t find the benefit to staying and paying 300% more rent for a space that is not taken care of in a dying plaza, where we are not allowed to expand at some point. So, that leaves us with the option of moving.   This option, at the moment, also seems impossible because summer is our slowest season and the studio is not in a financial position to accrue the expenses of moving.  This then, leaves us with the final decision of either moving or closing, the latter which we do NOT want to do and has been tearing us up at the thought of it.
In search for a miracle, we have found a wonderful new location in a busy plaza on Higley and University, with a landlord that is willing to work with Naam Yoga AZ and takes our current situation into consideration.  It’s a great opportunity and we feel in our hearts, it is the right move and will bring abundant growth and success.  It will allow us to have multiple classes at the same time and also give Harmonyum Healing and other healing treatments at any time of the day because the treatment rooms are not in the actual studio.  The potential is endless at this new space and will allow us to serve a greater population, bringing even more healing to the residents of Mesa.
So, I am stepping out of my comfort zone…ALL THE WAY…and asking for help.  We are in the business of teaching Yoga.  Yoga is about clearing away whatever is in us that prevents our living in the most full and whole way.  With yoga, we become aware of how & where we are restricted…and my greatest restriction is asking for help.  Therefore, if I am going to continue to teach and guide students, I must practice what I preach and let fear and ego go and trust the Plans the Universe has for me.
So, we am humbly reaching out to you, our beloved community, because we believe this center has made a difference in your lives.  We believe you understand the intention, purpose and passion for Naam Yoga and can perceive the vision for expansion to become a true healing center for the community.
           
WHAT WE NEED AND HOW YOU CAN HELP
In order to relocate, and transform this miracle space into the new community home of our beloved Naam Yoga AZ, we need to raise funds in excess of $21,000. And with the magic we have witnessed within this community, we know just how possible this is.
What is it for, you ask?  
The funds will be used for the cost of moving our current studio and transforming the new studio itself, as well as business licenses, escrow, taxes, insurance, and a small savings to keep things moving smoothly through the first few months of this transition. 
Any and all donation support for the Naam Yoga AZ Relocation will go directly into the project itself.  We will need to build out the new space and make it yoga worthy.
Your contributions will help cover:

City fees and requirements
Building improvements and alterations: fixtures, build wood cubbies to store the yoga props, customize the reception desk
Contractor fees 
General construction (installation of wood flooring, walls, paint, etc.)
Furniture and necessary furnishings
Additional yoga props 

           
            
 
We are also looking to expand our community by adding more teachers to our schedule, a permanent Teacher training program, hire front desk staff, MindBody software for easier check in and scheduling, additional classes, workshops, a children's program, and a full time trauma & recovery program.
Upon moving locations, Naam Yoga AZ will also be renamed NAAM YOGA ARIZONA CENTER FOR THE HEALING ARTS, using the power of the WORD to inform the Universe of our desire to expand and be of service in a greater way, becoming a beacon of God’s Healing Light in the community.  Through this relocation and expansion of Naam Yoga AZ, the tireless efforts of being of service will continue, offering not only a supportive and effective class timetable on site, but we will also endeavor to nourish our already established programs with children, seniors and the trauma/recovery community. With the stability of our new center, we are then able to be of service in our community of Mesa and beyond, building strong out-reach programs for childre,  teens, adults, elderly, physically challenged and more.
          
 
THE IMPACT
Yoga can change your life. We've seen it happen over and over. This practice allows people to develop a stronger sense of presence and realization of their potential. The world needs more Yoga! The world needs more Bliss!   This new space will make it possible for us to invite more people into our community, and to continue expanding the offerings that support our tribe and the affect yoga has on lives, community, and the world.  
Our desire is that Naam Yoga Arizona Center for the Healing Arts will be a Sanctuary of Peace, providing personal guidance, personal transformation, complete well-being, community connection, spiritual and metaphysical education, spiritual development – EMPOWERMENT.  Our wish is that Naam Yoga AZ be a nurturing haven, a place for people to come together for inspiration, creation and service – to raise consciousness toward balance and healing. Balanced and harmonious individuals create stable families and stable families become viable members in their community and society as a whole. It does take a village to change the world!
           
 
WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE ALL IN IT TOGETHER!
In its first 3 years, Naam Yoga AZ became an essential part of the community and we are committed to providing services that otherwise would not exist in Mesa. Even so, we have lots more moving and shaking to do!  The goals that come with having a new home are limitless!
This is a great opportunity to invest in the quality of life and vitality of our community. Every contributor is an essential part of our Naam Yoga AZ family. Your contribution is a hands-on way of helping us raise this barn and our gratitude is immeasurable.  Your contribution will make a difference at Naam Yoga Arizona.  As a contributor, you can know that you will be helping to create transformation, joy, healing and more in in your own and someone else’s life.  At Naam AZ, we truly believe that peace in our World starts with peace inside.  It is our goal to help individuals reach their own goals.

<h3>How this project got started</h3>
<p>My name is Yacoba Asare-Konadu. But you can call me Cobi!</p>
<p>After working in the fast-paced world of New York's fashion scene for a number of years, I felt a strong calling to shift my life towards a healthier, stronger and more balanced state of being. My journey in my own wellness began with teaching yoga, then evolving into a deeper interest in body work and the eventual discovery of Jin Shin Jyutsu: A Japanese Healing Art that involves releasing tension in the body through light touch.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502727567/mhrrg1czfxzyh782kzsl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While one-to-one services are at the heart of my work and craft, my true desire is to be able to deliver the invaluable knowledge of wellness and self-care far beyond my own reach. This is where the idea of The Wellness Toolkit was born: A simple website, rich with useful information and actionable steps you can take to empower your own daily self-care and well being. Tools for life! </p>
<h3>What Will The Wellness Toolkit Do?:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502728425/ghkqlcavewoqjvpkdfrm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Quick Tips:</strong> Provide access to actionable information that can help someone feel better in their bodies, immediately</li>
<li>
<strong>Affordable Resource: </strong>Provide an affordable at-home solution to self-care practices for people who do not have always have a physical studio, practitioner or educational resource nearby</li>
<li>
<strong>Simple Start: </strong>Provide practical, easy-to-follow guidance on how to take the first tangible steps to a healthier and more fulfilling life</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How we will bring The Wellness Toolkit to life:</h3>
<p>We are in need of funds to help pay for production costs of what will be my most ambitious project yet: a completely new and customized website, full of great content to select from including but not limited to: downloadable PDF’s, video tutorials, audible guided meditations, courses and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 of the project:</strong></p>
<p>Beautiful and cohesively designed downloadable PDF’s as content supplies including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge around our body’s nervous system, energy pathways and how they relate to our daily attitudes and behaviors</li>
<li>Affirmations and helpful daily guidances to keep your self-care practice in maintenance and in fluid motion</li>
<li>3-5 week long courses designed to help you transform the way you feel in your body from small changes in your food intake to how you wake up each morning and ways for you to create new energy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2 of the project:</strong></p>
<p>Professionally produced video tutorials and high quality audio-based guides including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily Meditation Practices</li>
<li>Easy to follow classes that you can take in the privacy and convenience of your own home</li>
<li>Recipes and Rituals: A series of videos and recipes that places hydration, nourishment and positive energy at the center of your daily practice</li>
</ul>
<h3>How the funds will be used:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502729853/ipd1n8yfspdftxehztus.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>10,000 USD</strong> broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>5,000 - Video production</strong> - this will go to the video producers of shooting and editing our first batch of videos including Jin Shin Jyutsu introductions, tutorials, meditation, yoga, recipes, rituals, interviews, vlogs varying from 3-60 minute increments and more.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>2,000 - Website development &amp; Responsive Mobile Design </strong>- We will emphasize a highly user-friendly digital experience that will be perfect for both desktop and mobile experiences. The point of The Wellness Toolkit is to provide immediacy and we need to be able to make sure folks can receive this content, even while they’re on the go!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>2,000 - Marketing:</strong> Our marketing and distribution campaign will work largely off of social media and we’ll need to create platform specific content, including but not limited to Facebook Live Campaigns, Sponsored Ads on Instagram, Sponsored Ads on YouTube as well as a budget for limited merchandise and production costs for in-person events.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>1,000 - Design:</strong> So much of the success of the Wellness Toolkit will be attributed to how we can transform complex information into an experience that feels inviting, accessible, easy-to-use and practical for ALL bodies. I’ll need to bring on someone who understands the concept and mission to help me translate what I know how to do with my physical practice into a beautiful digital experience.<br/> </li>
<li><strong>Priority of funds will go on creating the product (the videos and web development).</strong></li>

<p>Your contribution to this project will help so many people have access to tools, in addition to its inevitable effect on bringing wellness to areas of need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empowering people to make positive decisions for their own self-care and well being</li>
<li>Designing a relevant and contemporary look for ancient methods of healing</li>
<li>Reaching a larger audience than the limitations of a singular network</li>
<li>Providing disarming, easy-to-follow guidance to those who have been dissuaded from wellness 'trends'</li>
<li>Creating opportunities for people to feel their best in their bodies, immediately</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The importance in designing information for EVERY body:</h3>
<p>The picture of contemporary wellness practices does not always accurately reflect the uniqueness of all bodies and beings. The Wellness Toolkit will be designed in such a way that addresses all ages, all shapes and sizes, all gender presentations, identities and origins. </p>
<p>The Wellness Toolkit will invite people of all experiences to begin exploring the root cause of some of their deepest ailments and provide them with informative, actionable tools to help themselves feel their best in their bodies.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We view our biggest risks and challenges to be in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of belief in someone being able to take their health into their own hands, or lack of belief that this toolkit is made for them</li>
<li>The inability to pay the producers of the content</li>
<li>No awareness or ability to reach the people who need this toolkit the most</li>
</ul>
<p>How we can mitigate these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will prioritize designing content that conveys self-care being accessible by people of all different experiences vs. a one-dimensional view of a healthy body</li>
<li>We will be creating paid packages and abilities to receive 1:1 personalized consultations to help cover costs on a continuing basis in addition to hosting monthly events, merchandise sale and sponsored partnerships.</li>
<li>We will be working closely with a dedicated marketing and advertising team to ensure that the content is being distributed in smart, strategic and sensible ways.</li>

<p>My name is Jane Parker and I am the founder of Radiance Natural Health. My interest in nutrition started 10 years ago and I have been practicing as a nutritional therapist for 5 years. I am a chef and have a passion for cooking and the power of food for health and well being. I have proved this power through my own health journey.</p>
<p>Our vision with Radiance is to bring together the power of different natural ways of healing under one roof, nutrition, yoga and natural healing therapies. We want to make it affordable and fun and create a flourishing health community where we can all support each other. We want to create a charity that we can grow to help people live in good health and show them how to cook healthy affordable (in both time and money!) meals to sustain optimum health. But also the importance of supporting food choices with life enhancing ways of feeling healthy and happy and balanced through yoga, mindfulness, meditation and simple grounding techniques.</p>
<p>By supporting us and getting involved you can be part of a new paradigm of health as we believe the future of health care lies in natural medicine and nurturing of ourselves through natural therapies, yoga and simple things like connecting with nature. We believe this is much needed in this world of confusion and rising poor health.</p>

<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>We are looking for funds to further develop our beautiful Cornish retreat. We have worked tirelessly for the past five years to build our business to this point and now want to take it to a new level with our health offering and by creating a not for profit charity status. With your help and support:</p>
<p>We would like to refurbish some space to create the nutrition clinic and a treatment room which will also house our infrared sauna. Both rooms need some tender loving care to restore them. Our existing yoga studio also requires some refurbishment and new equipment........</p>
<p>We'd also like to get funding to purchase a commercial juicer to support both our planned detox events and our residential retreats.</p>
<p>Also we'd like to create flexibility in our accommodation to make retreats and residential events more affordable by purchasing a few additional single beds to turn three of our huge rooms into sharing rooms for singles and small groups.</p>

We want to provide sensible up to the minute help for those struggling with a myriad of health concerns whilst taking the individual into account...we are all different and have varying needs.</p>

</div></div>","About us

My name is Jane Parker and I am the founder of Radiance Natural Health. My interest in nutrition started 10 years ago and I have been practicing as a nutritional therapist for 5 years. I am a chef and have a passion for cooking and the power of food for health and well being. I have proved this power through my own health journey.
Our vision with Radiance is to bring together the power of different natural ways of healing under one roof, nutrition, yoga and natural healing therapies. We want to make it affordable and fun and create a flourishing health community where we can all support each other. We want to create a charity that we can grow to help people live in good health and show them how to cook healthy affordable (in both time and money!) meals to sustain optimum health. But also the importance of supporting food choices with life enhancing ways of feeling healthy and happy and balanced through yoga, mindfulness, meditation and simple grounding techniques.
By supporting us and getting involved you can be part of a new paradigm of health as we believe the future of health care lies in natural medicine and nurturing of ourselves through natural therapies, yoga and simple things like connecting with nature. We believe this is much needed in this world of confusion and rising poor health.

We plan to offer a full range of treatments and therapies to support your whole body and mind, with nutrition at the forefront.

Nutritional therapy
Cookery workshops
Yoga studio
Massage therapies
Reiki
Shiatsu
Film nights
Aromatherapy and flower essence workshops
Meditation and mindfulness
Singing workshops

All of this in the most stunning location surrounded by 25 acres of unspoiled countryside, tranquility and nature.

<h3>What is Sanctuary In the City?</h3>
<p>Sanctuary in the City was founded by six, women of color community leaders who saw the need for an accessible, safe, and affirming space for individuals and families of color to gather locally to promote transformation on personal, social, community, professional, and environmental levels. Growing and healing from race-based trauma through focus on the whole self, for all persons of color, is the primary purpose of this intentionally-created space. The Sanctuary in the City will offer workshops, marketplaces, conferences, and other events to foster six key pillars:</p> <p>Mind-Body Wellness</p>
<p>Empowerment</p>
<p>Preservation</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship</p>
<p>Arts &amp; Culture</p>
<p>Personal Development &amp; Knowledge</p>
<p>Community</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Are You Going To Do With the Money?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create accessible programming that meets the needs of our community.  We aim to eliminate barriers like unaffordable class pricing and space rental fees. Cooperative economics and authentic collaboration are principles that are a part of who we are. Through intentional work and self determination we are focused on providing services, classes  and community space through a sustainable sliding scale which includes free and donation based offerings. At this time, the housing climate in Charlotte is unstable. Neighborhoods are being uprooted and communities are being displaced. We are on a place of uncertainty about the best location to put down roots. At this time we are looking to be able to host offerings at varied locations throughout the Charlotte metro area. Your participation and support through tax deductible donations will support our ability to provide:</p> <p>Financial workshops</p>
<p>Pop-up meditation tents</p>
<p>Health and wellness workshops</p>
<p>Pop up yoga offerings</p>
<p>Home improvement workshops</p>
<p>Hand delivering encouraging notes and snacks  to people in need</p>
<p>Home buying educational workshops (red-lining, mortgage lending)</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship Training and Education</p>
<p>Community Building Events</p>
<p>Political and Social Advocacy</p>
<p>Story Circles</p>
<p>We are seeking $75,000 to cover the projected budget for the startup and first year expenses of this project. This budget includes the cost of acquiring a space, maintaining utilities, funding programming goals and acquiring equipment. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
<p>The solutions we seek do not exist. We have so many resources and need space to curate ways to share, build, and reimagine the narratives around our wellness. We know that we no longer need to depend on other people to solve anything for our community.</p> <p>Our group has been meeting in different capacities for over one year to slowly build our vision, align our talents, and formulate a plan of action to bring regular, accessible programming to the City of Charlotte. Our vision is tied to the collective healing that can brings our community together to find new patterns to heal old traumas.</p>
<p>Healing will occur in the community spaces we create, when we connect to our individual humanity, honor and celebrate the strength that we possess and cultivate authentic community offerings.</p>

<p>Hello and many blessing to all of you contributors and thank you for reading our project!</p>
<p>This space has been used for guiding souls on one to one and groups in vastly different ways; emotionally, spiritually and even physically in their journey to find peace. We created a space for silent retreats for healers, teachers, students, business entrepreneurs, office workers, artists, musicians, writers. Really anyone of any age is welcome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have been hit by 3 flash flood in 2 months which destroyed most of the building structures includes bridge, meditation space, the two bungalows we had built for the students and ground floor of the main area and kitchen. </p>
<p>I am not giving up of what I have to share to others.  We wish to start rebuilding and make it weather proof adaptable to all seasons we experienced for the past few years here. </p>
<p>Below are some pictures taken randomly around the property after the flood.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will need to build a new roof for my five bungalows, change the bamboo structure and elevate the bungalows higher from the ground so in the eventuality of another flood the water will be flowing under. We will treat the bamboo for the weather wearing and also purchase new table and chairs. We calculated with the cost of the labour, electricity water and rent for the next 10 months a budget of 10 000 usd.</p>
<p>It will be the unique space to get too with a river to cross and a jungle surrounding the property. It will also be a non digital place with limited coverage here so busy city life worker will find peace all along.</p>
<p>In the event of not reaching the entire amount desired, the money will be used to renovate what we can with it.</p>

<h3>Who I am and what I do</h3>
<p>Since I was young, I always felt that I was born for a bigger purpose in life. At that time, I still wasn’t sure what it was. I could only dream about my life purpose. Maybe it was only an illusion!  The life I had in the corporate world and my unhappy household didn’t serve the calling that I have always felt. It didn't matter how successful I might have been in my work, family and social life.  Nothing seemed to fulfil me. So the search began. I turned down jobs and overruled my family to pursue what we call spirituality!</p>
<p>Leading a conscious, healthy lifestyle is important to me.  I never underestimate the impact that the psyche can have on a person's physical well-being. If we're going to get through this life in one piece, we need to take care of ourselves beyond the typical nutrition and exercise. I found the Light of internal peace and clarity. </p>
<p> I believe that we can always bounce back from what knocks us down and come back and be  stronger than before. We are capable of reprogramming our mind in the ways we see, feel, listen and get to our inner truth.</p>
<p>I have learned to live harmonically between our physical nature and in the myths of the unseen world with my love, light and kindness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This coffee shop will be one stop for local people and travellers to practice mindfulness, meditation, learning and sharing ideas. </p>
<p>So I will adapt and re-orientate my activity for who is already here. I want to offer the Thai people, expats and anyone really, a place to be free to talk, meditate and escape from the busy city life to reconnect with the mother earth and themselves.</p>
<h3>How your contribution will help</h3>
<p>In this challenging time we need to become more human than ever, I am seeing everyday the technology taking over our lives. By creating the space for you and us together we connect again organically with the nature and the universe which create the balance between the two world ( the Tech and the Human ). I am a healer and a guide for those who come to me in their journey of finding peace within. Your contribution will allow me to continue the journey and share my understanding and knowledge for a more mindful society.     </p>
<p>I held a space for silent retreats in the past for healers, teachers, students, business entrepreneurs, office workers, artists, musicians, writers, and anyone, of any age, who seek to master their life and their professions.</p>
<h3><strong><i>Some feedback from my students who came to stay at my space ;</i></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“I don't know how to describe this, but all I can say she is definitely a healer. I've spent money on many psychologists and doctors, but what she was able to do in just a day trumps all of that. Truly a remarkable experience.” Karyn</p></li>
<li><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“Naiyana...is a piece of heaven. You can feel the beautiful energy...Her warmth, spirit and natural healing ability made this one of the most meaningful weeks in my life. ..Forever grateful. Love u Naiyana for giving me your selfless time and energy and showing me how to heal.” Yusuf</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why helping me to run this place ?</h3>
<p>One of the main challenge is the maintenance of the property. I would  like to keep every structure as natural as possible to create sustainable space without the use of permanent material which would become waste to the land. I use bamboo and it doesn't last long due to my limited resources to treat the material. The funds will allow me to treat the bamboo so it can last longer by protecting it from the weather, with treatment the bamboo could last for up to 5 years.</p>
<p>I have created this living style to set an example to all who come to me. I have been teaching/guiding for more than 5 years so I know the strengths and weaknesses of the bamboo structure and the challenges to keep the place running. I saw how the rain and the wind get in and how close the bush fire can get, and now I saw the river flooded.... I can say I have seen it all from all directions.</p>
<p>I will build a better roof and foundation for all bungalows and the sala. I will lift the floor higher to let the water from the river run its course under and safely.</p>
<p>Living among the nature is also believing in the force of nature, I will not be able to prevent all natural disasters 100 per cents but we can prepare and protect the best we can....</p>
<p>With love and kindness....</p>

I held a space for silent retreats in the past for healers, teachers, students, business entrepreneurs, office workers, artists, musicians, writers, and anyone, of any age, who seek to master their life and their professions.
Some feedback from my students who came to stay at my space ;

“I don't know how to describe this, but all I can say she is definitely a healer. I've spent money on many psychologists and doctors, but what she was able to do in just a day trumps all of that. Truly a remarkable experience.” Karyn
“Naiyana...is a piece of heaven. You can feel the beautiful energy...Her warmth, spirit and natural healing ability made this one of the most meaningful weeks in my life. ..Forever grateful. Love u Naiyana for giving me your selfless time and energy and showing me how to heal.” Yusuf


Why helping me to run this place ?
One of the main challenge is the maintenance of the property. I would  like to keep every structure as natural as possible to create sustainable space without the use of permanent material which would become waste to the land. I use bamboo and it doesn't last long due to my limited resources to treat the material. The funds will allow me to treat the bamboo so it can last longer by protecting it from the weather, with treatment the bamboo could last for up to 5 years.
I have created this living style to set an example to all who come to me. I have been teaching/guiding for more than 5 years so I know the strengths and weaknesses of the bamboo structure and the challenges to keep the place running. I saw how the rain and the wind get in and how close the bush fire can get, and now I saw the river flooded.... I can say I have seen it all from all directions.
I will build a better roof and foundation for all bungalows and the sala. I will lift the floor higher to let the water from the river run its course under and safely.
Living among the nature is also believing in the force of nature, I will not be able to prevent all natural disasters 100 per cents but we can prepare and protect the best we can....
With love and kindness....
Please pass it on !

You can make donation or purchase my services or just spread the word Thank you all!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>Lazy Cat Cafe's BIG MOVE</b></h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Dave Robb. Many of you that find yourselves here will already know me from the Lazy Cat Cafe.</p>
<p>For 18 months, we have worked hard to offer a unique and relaxing experience in the heart of Preston and from the reviews, we have been going from strength to strength:</p>
<ul>
<li>163 5* trip advisor reviews </li>
<li>Many reviews and recommendation on FB</li>
<li>Over 150 reviews on Google</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m here today as after the success, the laughter and the countless cat cuddles, we need to move to NEW premises. Our current lease has run out and planned building work means we cannot stay. Having identified and provisionally agreed new premises on Lancaster Road in Preston City centre, we need <i>your</i> help to get us there!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583235594/wx6ohju0qr8yimezldth.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The story so far...</h3>
<p>We really have made a much loved and special place in Preston for people to come together and interact with our beautiful cats; whether playing, cuddling, unwinding, or just talking with staff about all things cats and many things not cat! With people coming from Preston, Blackpool, Lancaster and as far away as Norway, Canada and Bermuda! We want to keep this going and excitedly look to make the experience even better at our new premises. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2FS8emQZJ4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The community has been amazing so as part of the move, we want to deliver on some of the areas you have been asking us for to include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Afternoon tea</strong> and light bites.</li>
<li>
<strong>Focused events</strong>, whether tabletop gaming nights, singles nights, just late nights! </li>
<li>We are also just starting to explore some possibilities around <strong>group therapy and wellbeing</strong> sessions.  </li>
<li>
<strong>More cats</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Cat Cafe means so much to myself and to so many people in the local area, with many citing it as the best place in Preston! (thank you). We need your help to stay in Preston and open at a new location, and we would like as many of you as possible to take this opportunity to get involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are already moving forward, working on the Big Move and found suitable premises on Lancaster Road and agreed terms. These premises will give us the space to expand the existing cafe and offer improve facilities for the Cats and visitors alike.</p>
<p>The short version of the sums!</p>
<ul>
<li>Securing New premises – £10,000  (includes first 3 months business rates)</li>
<li>Improvements and fittings: £4,000</li>
<li>Council approvals - £1,000</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We are offering prepaid cat sessions along with a number of unique perks to both raise the funds to secure the new premises along with expanding into some exciting areas.</p>
<p>Even more excitingly, if we <i>over achieve</i> our goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>We would like to further enrich the environment with new toys and furniture.</li>
<li>Maybe even a few new cats!</li>
<li>Additional Kitchen equipment and more!</li>
<li>Development of the booking system to allow more flexible bookings and improved easier experience (flexible times, flexible booking length)</li>
<li>Improved security - shutters for the premises. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The additional space will also allow us to start to offer food, with a focus on offering a mixed menu to include Vegan and Gluten Free options. Importantly and initially offering afternoon tea with scones, small cake bites and light bites.</p>
<p>As well as our great house blend coffee and the exceptionally well received hot chocolate, we would like to offer a huge range of tea and expand the coffee shop to create a peaceful escape to the hustle and bustle of modern life.</p>
<p>Oh... and did we mention new addition to the cat team??</p>
<p>So, you know what we need, and our plans, can you help us get there?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What your input means</strong></h3>
<p>Without the trust and support of the public and community at large, we couldn’t do this. Your support will enable the continued success of Preston's own Cat Cafe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>In re-opening we have had a number of challenges, many of which we have already addressed; however we want to take our last year and a half’s experience and use this to create a ‘sanctuary’ in the heart of Preston.</p>
<p>This unique experience puts us in a great position to understand the challenges and mitigate many risks, however there are still areas we can't effectively manage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financially securing the new premises.</li>
<li>The time it takes to settle the cats into their new home.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>With our existing experience and your support we know we can address these key points. Not to mention the fact we have 9 lives!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>We really do have an amazing community, and couldnt have achieved what we have so far without you. We would ask you all out there to really help us spread the word. If you could Promote, Like, Share, just really make some noise about our campaign, it would be invaluable to us all here at the Cafe. #thebigmove</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have any ideas, or feedback for us, please get in touch! </p>
<p>We hope you are as excited as we are!</p>

Who is MOJO?
Melissa Jo Hunter, a.k.a. MOJO is an International Spokes Model, Reality TV Star and Published Poet originally from Indianapolis, Indiana now living in Hollywood.
L.A. Times Festival of Books - Los Angeles, CA

This is MOJO's third campaign here on Indie Go Go.  You can see she is a gal who gets things done, no matter what obstacles stand in her way.  When the WHY is big enough the HOW takes care of itself.
In her first Pretty Poems to Ponder Book Campaign MOJO raised $1,025 by 7 backers to get the book formatted, edited, published and printed. 
In her second campaign MOJO raised $770 by 9 backers to help with shipping and handling of book submissions, marketing and work the audio book and website.
This third campaign is of the utmost importance to help get the finished product, the Pretty Poems to Ponder book into the hands who need it before it's too late.
Contributors will not only be helping MOJO follow her passion of sharing her lessons of love and light with the world but also getting a perfect inspirational poetry book into the hands of your loved ones and needful.


You can help make the world a better place!Make a Date With Your Soul now!What We Need & What You Get
It's not about the money goal... it's about helping 5,000 people.

I crunched the numbers to get the price of the book as low as it could go.  If you kindly consider becoming an Archangel Sponsor I will personally be able to deliver the books to local organizations in need.
I have set aside my goals of creating a beautiful website, audio book, creating an LLC, traveling on a book tour, creating inspirational card decks and dvds for now... because I know what matters most is getting these inspirational poems into the hands of those who need them.

<h2>Klokbox - Personal Story</h2>
<p><strong>The safest way to give my family everything they'll need !</strong></p>
<p>When tragedy struck our family we realized that Dad suddenly dying meant lots would change. Our loss of his memories, his inspiration and shared stories was compounded by his not having a will. That certainly put things into perspective and I didn't want history repeating itself. </p>
<p>I was looking for a really <strong>safe way to let my family know how much I cared</strong> in case anything should happen to me. To do this, all I could find were expensive lawyers who made the process complex and impersonal.</p>
<p>Klokbox has evolved into a strong desire for a clear, enduring legacy to my wife and 5 kids. A way <strong>I can connect with them after I'm gone</strong>. I wanted to create something they could interact with <strong>forever</strong>, but at the same time it all needed to be <strong>clear, concise and legally binding</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Less than 30% </strong>of the population plan their lives or create a lasting<strong> legacy plan. </strong>This seems crazy considering death is inevitable but it's something we simply don’t want to think about. Dying is such a terrible industry, I thought - let’s shake it up.</p>
<p>The legacy market is not just boring it’s also overpriced, confusing, and inconvenient.</p>
<p>Times change and industries get disrupted. <strong>Klokbox </strong>connects your<strong> life plan </strong>for<strong> future generations.</strong> It's literally your digital <strong>diary,</strong> a place to express your intentions with clarity, to give inspiration. Klokbox is so comprehensive, it covers everything you'll need to craft your complete legacy,  to share things your family will need and love to see ... once you're gone.</p>

<h3>Brick City Yoga Overview </h3>
<p>Welcome to the Brick City Yoga campaign page! I'm Kate, owner and founder of Brick City Yoga. I'm excited to bring yoga to Benton Park West. </p>
<p>I purchased the building at 2758 Wyoming summer of 2018 and began the remodeling process, with the goal of creating a community space and restoring the corner of Wyoming &amp; California.  </p>
<p>Brick City Yoga aims to be an economically accessible yoga studio and community space.  I received my 200 RYT certification through Yoga Buzz St. Louis, and my 95-hour RCYT through Southtown Yoga in St. Louis. All Brick City Yoga instructors are certified instructors, and many have specialized certifications. We will offer affordable ($10) yoga classes and accommodate all levels from beginner to experienced  to speciality workshops and children's programming.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Building out and opening a studio is pricey! We are hoping to raise $10-15K from our campaign to offset some of our expenses. You'll help us: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pay down some of our construction debt (yikes)</li>
<li>Build out our lobby</li>
<li>Install our sound system</li>
<li>Install our CRM system</li>
<li>Add signage to the building</li>
<li>Stock the studio with props</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>As a thank you, we are offering several perks including yoga classes, cool logo merchandise from STL-Style, exclusive product from Lark Skin Co., handbags from Mandolin, and of course high fives and eternal gratitude. Check out our perks for more details and stay tunes as more perks may be added. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Brick City Yoga in the Community </h3>
<p>Your support will allow us to open the doors, and we think our studio will have a pretty great impact on our neighborhood too: </p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly classes will be $10 all the time</li>
<li>We will pay our instructors fairly </li>
<li>We will contribute profits from one weekly class to a local non-profit</li>
<li>You'll also be supporting the local makers featured in this campaign</li>
<li>Our rehab will ensure the corner of California and Wyoming is vibrant and inviting again! </li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>Of course, with any construction project, there are always risks and challenges. We've had to increase our budget a bit, are learning about required permits and working on our patience with timelines. While we are hopeful we can open in the Winter, our biggest risk is not hitting this deadline, but we are confident we will open very soon! </p>

<p>2020 was a year of reckoning for all of us to rethink our relationships with nature, with others, and most importantly with ourselves. For me, this past year propelled me to pursue my passion for holistic wellness through ethically sourced spices. I am excited to launch Holy Spice to offer a peek into the wellness spices I grew up having, and to extend the sense of comfort it gave me and to everyone around me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>All Natural Wellness:</h3>
<p>South Asian food is known for its use of spices to enhance its flavor, but the Ayurvedic science behind the benefits of each spice in the harmonious blends that grace our kitchen shelves is often ignored. The goodness of spices remains a well-kept secret with Indian household cooks who work up magic in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I wish to reveal and celebrate that knowledge by sharing it with you in an accessible manner. Holy Spices will offer a plethora of ways to use spices beyond the exotic golden turmeric latte, and into the daily cup of chai. A simple switch to a healthier lifestyle, with a dash of wellbeing into your plate!</p>

<h3>Our Sourcing Partner, Vrutti</h3>
<p>Well if there is anyone we trust in supporting our farmers and making sure they have all the resources, it's Vrutti. We believe that empowerment, just like physical health, needs nourishment at the granular level to become truly sustainable. Despite the vast troves of knowledge that farmers possess, they are unable to make steady and fair income from their occupation due to fast-paced, insatiable markets that exploit natural resources. Organizations like Vrutti  recognize this gap and are committed to creating systems that can make farming profitable as well as sustainable. </p>
<p>We support Vrutti’s efforts by sourcing some our spices from female farmers in near Bangalore, India. </p>

<h3>The School of Golden Transformation</h3>
<p>Katerina Kostkova is super excited to launch her new online study portal for Golden Transformation with hypnotherapies, meditations, yoga and Golden Rituals that will support you to live your best life. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This is such an important campaign that will help Katerina get the online portal off the ground and into reality. </span></p>
<p>Katerina’s healing path started 10 years ago with regression therapy and in 2015 she completed her studies of Agama Yoga teachings in Thailand where she lived for two years in an ashram. <br/><br/>Katerina has been teaching on a daily basis since 2015. Her work is based upon the experiences of many high level teachers and expansive experiences. Kashmir Shaivism brings her a great knowledge of the alchemy of yoga, self-healing and it gives her the opportunity to live a liberated life! Katerina also writes articles for one of the most famous Czech yoga magazines.</p>
<h3>Golden Transformation As Written by Katerina...</h3>
<p>Transformation is a process we go through in constant waves, in order for transformation to have real potential, we need fire, but the fire must not be too strong so we do not burn ourselves in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Transformation is the process of through the activation of a set of Golden Keys, or steps.</strong></p>
<p>The whole process is the process of awakening and activating the body, mind and soul. This then creates a unified connection with the experience of being.</p>
<p>During this transformation process and<strong> reclaiming of our power</strong> through Golden Keys, we will activate new experiences in our body, mind, and soul and we can use this to empower our every day life. </p>
<p>Here are some of the keys: </p>
<p>+ Activation of the system through physical practice / yoga (specific asanas) - cleansing the body and individual chakras</p>
<p>+ Purification Techniques - Uddiana Bhanda + Nauli Kriya - Purification of Organs</p>
<p>+ Voice healing - voice activation through vowel pranyama + sound healing - increased vibration</p>
<p>+ Guided meditation - <strong>increasing vibrations</strong> by purifying individual chakras / beginning of the golden process of transformation</p>
<p>+ Guided deep relaxation - Integration of the golden process</p>
<p>+ Work with visualization full activation - Golden Sphere</p>
<p>+ Manifestation</p>
<p>+ Golden reality - Anchoring intentions / Abundance of presence</p>
<p><strong>What will this activation bring?</strong></p>
<p>It will bring a multidimensional experience of oneself, and a <strong>manifestation of your intentions</strong> into everyday reality, <strong>abundance</strong>, anchoring oneself, <strong>connection to source</strong>, and a creation reality from your center point. It will also bring strength, vitality, awareness of one's abilities, and a strengthening of one's potential. You will also have full acceptance of oneself in God's nature.<br/> </p>

<h3>What Do The Golden Rituals Include?</h3>
<p>The Golden Rituals will come in a package of videos and audios. One of the most amazing things about Agama Yoga is that you do it with your eyes closed. This means that once you have watched the video a couple of times then you can follow with audio on your speakers or on your headphones - it's much easier than setting up your laptop or computer each morning! <strong>Just find a space to put your yoga mat, put on the audio and listen to Katja's soothing and calming voice</strong>!</p>

<p>In Katja's 8 Golden Rituals you'll be taken through:<br/><br/>1) <strong>Somatic work</strong> - First we must prepare and purify the body, we will work on specific asanas that activate specific chakras. Whilst the body prepares, the chakras become cleansed.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Cleansing techniques</strong> - You will learn how to repair and cleanse the organs in your Golden Ritual practice.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Voice healing</strong> - Prepare and cleanse your voice. It's time to take the power back, working with Vishudda chakra.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Guided meditations</strong> - This will take you on a rich and deep experience of your whole being</p>
<p>5) <strong>Deep relaxation</strong> - Prepare to relax on a new level of being</p>
<p>6) <strong>Working with visualization</strong> - Your greatest visions are the fuel for your golden dream life.</p>
<p>7) <strong>Manifest your greatest reality</strong> You will be shown how to bring all it all into form.</p>
<p>8) <strong>Golden reality</strong> - Gratitude and blessings for your new Golden reality. </p>
<p><strong>BONUS!</strong></p>
<p>You will also receive 5 free hypnotherapies in English from Stephen James Burford, a certified RTT (Rapid Transformational Therapy Practitioner).</p>

Katerina Kostkova is super excited to launch her new online study portal for Golden Transformation with hypnotherapies, meditations, yoga and Golden Rituals that will support you to live your best life. 
This is such an important campaign that will help Katerina get the online portal off the ground and into reality. 
Katerina’s healing path started 10 years ago with regression therapy and in 2015 she completed her studies of Agama Yoga teachings in Thailand where she lived for two years in an ashram. Katerina has been teaching on a daily basis since 2015. Her work is based upon the experiences of many high level teachers and expansive experiences. Kashmir Shaivism brings her a great knowledge of the alchemy of yoga, self-healing and it gives her the opportunity to live a liberated life! Katerina also writes articles for one of the most famous Czech yoga magazines.
Golden Transformation As Written by Katerina...
Transformation is a process we go through in constant waves, in order for transformation to have real potential, we need fire, but the fire must not be too strong so we do not burn ourselves in the process.
Golden Transformation is the process of through the activation of a set of Golden Keys, or steps.
The whole process is the process of awakening and activating the body, mind and soul. This then creates a unified connection with the experience of being.
During this transformation process and reclaiming of our power through Golden Keys, we will activate new experiences in our body, mind, and soul and we can use this to empower our every day life. 
Here are some of the keys: 
+ Activation of the system through physical practice / yoga (specific asanas) - cleansing the body and individual chakras
+ Purification Techniques - Uddiana Bhanda + Nauli Kriya - Purification of Organs
+ Voice healing - voice activation through vowel pranyama + sound healing - increased vibration
+ Guided meditation - increasing vibrations by purifying individual chakras / beginning of the golden process of transformation
+ Guided deep relaxation - Integration of the golden process
+ Work with visualization full activation - Golden Sphere
+ Manifestation
+ Golden reality - Anchoring intentions / Abundance of presence
What will this activation bring?
It will bring a multidimensional experience of oneself, and a manifestation of your intentions into everyday reality, abundance, anchoring oneself, connection to source, and a creation reality from your center point. It will also bring strength, vitality, awareness of one's abilities, and a strengthening of one's potential. You will also have full acceptance of oneself in God's nature.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Whether you are someone who enjoys an audience or someone who prefers to slightly sway in a room by yourself, most of us have joyful memories of dance. And, the joy of dance is contagious. <strong>Movements for Movements</strong> is a non-profit concept in the start-up stage. It aims to offer dance/movement therapy workshops to communities such as underfunded schools, boys' and girls' clubs, veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress, Native American reservations, treatment centers, refugee camps, and many more. </p>
<p>Quentin Robinson's goal for teaching dance broadened after he conducted a dance workshop on the Nakivale Refugee Settlement of Uganda, with the American Refugee Committee. He became acutely aware of, not only the potential that dance has in breaking social barriers, but of the inescapable need for dance/movement therapy in impoverished and traumatized communities. Dance is a universal language which we all share, no matter our socioeconomic class, gender, race, or nationality. </p>
<p>With 20 years of professional dance experience, Quentin is very familiar with the grounding effect physical movement has on the body, emotions, thoughts, and spirit.  Intentional physical movement grounds us in the present moment.  It fully focuses the mind on what is happening NOW, and it allows us to immediately attend to the space we are moving through.  This practice of focusing the mind on <i>only</i> the current moment is called ""mindfulness."" Mindfulness permits the brain to be at peace so the nervous system can relax, recharge, and reset. There is universal evidence that practicing mindfulness is the key to healing trauma, and dance is a form of mindfulness which incorporates great joy! </p>
<p>With the help of donations, Quentin aims to start the non-profit organization <strong>Movements for Movements</strong> to provide dance/movement workshops. He hopes to reach local and international communities suffering from trauma associated with poverty and violence. Your donations will meet the needs of <strong>Movements for Movements</strong> non-profit start-up costs as well as travel costs.</p>

Her skin care products became known under the brand climbOn, a line of 100% plant-based, cruelty-free products adored by climbers around the world including the #1 climber Tommy Caldwell.Polly realized the need for 100% plant-based, NON-GMO, vegan & cruelty-free skin care, was not just a need for the brave climbers and athletes, but an opportunity for all of us to rid our skin and bodies of toxins. This campaign is designed to introduce SKINourishment’s everyday skin care line - POLYN - to everyone.The POLYN Essential 5 Face Line includes a regimen to exfoliate dead skin, clean and purify, stimulate collagen, and rejuvenate skin. This bundle is made from the following plants: 

Purifying Clay Mask - Adzuki beans, Bentonite, and Rosehip

Invigorating Toner - Peppermint, Echnachia, and Lavender

Cooling Under Eye Serum - Aloe, Rosehip + Frankincense

Regenerative Face Serum - Tuberose wax, Rosehip, and Shea butter

I am ready to grow my own business in a way that will improve our family’s quality of life and allow me to continue cultivating the purpose and drive I have for being of service to mothers and children while continuing to care for my two boys. At this time, my husband and I do not have access to the financial means, including loans, that will support this venture.What I Will CreateThe business model and CEU programs will enable me to:- Implement a highly efficient and professional system medically, structurally, and financially- Understand how to create an inspiring advertising message and market myself efficiently and effectively with minimal costs - Refine my message and position of authority in the medicine- Enhance my website to reflect these changes- Fully step into and embrace the confident and powerful physician that I am  How We Will Transform Our Community Together I am committed to completing this program for myself and the community I serve. I intend to help transform our community by: - Increasing awareness about the benefits of acupuncture and Chinese medicine to an entire family's physical and emotional health- Empowering and offering women the tools to care for themselves during and after pregnancy- Supporting pregnant mothers through the most challenging phases of pregnancy, both physical and emotional- Supporting optimal health for mother and baby throughout pregnancy- Supporting mothers postpartum, both physically and psychologically (postpartum depression)- Teaching the community about the power of Chinese medicine to help heal childhood illness and disease- Empowering parents with the tools to help provide care for their children when they are ill- Helping people find a way out of long-term chronic illness or pain  With Deepest GratitudeThank you for taking the time to listen to me. It is not easy for me to ask for help and financial support, and yet, at the same time, I feel a deep force in my heart pushing me to do this for my family, myself and my community.If you feel inspired and are willing and available to give at this time, we would be deeply grateful for your support and encouragement. Any amount of money will help me transform my practice and enhance our already blessed family experience.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Birth of a Doula</h2>
<p>A Birth Doula supports women as they navigate pregnancy, birth, and life with a newborn baby. </p>
<p>The word Doula in ancient Greek means “a woman who serves,” She is a trained professional who gives continuous physical (non-medical), emotional and informational support to expectant parents, laboring mamas, and postpartum families.  A Birth Doula helps mamas have a positive and safe birth experience. During the months before birth, a Doula can help you create a birth plan that’s right for you. During labor she will advocate for you and help the rest of your team follow your birth plan, whatever you choose it to be. A doula is helpful during a home birth, birth at a birth center, or in birth at a hospital. She may be especially helpful if you want to labor in the hospital where you’re unlikely to have a close relationship with your medical team.  Having a doula on your team can help your birth story be one you remember with great joy.</p>
<p>Pregnancy and birth are powerful times of self growth, self realization, and transformation. With the birth of a baby, comes the birth of a mother and the birth of a family as well.  It is my passion to support women as they travel through the powerful portal of pregnancy and birth and use the energy created there to become powerful, peaceful, purposeful mothers.</p>
<p>The spirit of the pregnancy and the birth echoes a thousand times over in this lifetime and in generations to come. Birth has the power to change lives. It is a deeply transformational experience. One that touches the unknown and connects us with our life force. Birth is natural and normal, safe and divine. It has the potential to be deeply nourishing, life affirming, and beautiful. </p>
<p>I have learned so much about pregnancy and birth through my own experience giving birth to my son. I am still integrating the beauty and energy of my pregnancy and birth. I am healing personal trauma, I am clearing family karma, I am understanding the power and beauty of my body on a whole new level. I am becoming a mother, more and more every day. I am reaching new levels of love and understanding through my relationship with my son. My life is alive and bathed in light in a way it has never been before. My powers of abundance and manifestation are heightened and my intuition is off the charts! Pregnancy and birth were the most powerful experiences of growth and transformation I have ever experienced. I am inspired to learn everything I can about this powerful and sacred window of time in a woman's life and become a birth doula to support women in making the most of this precious time in their own lives. </p>

<h3>Welcome to our R3volution!<br/> </h3>
<h3>Chris Nelson, author, entrepreneur, yoga teacher and the founder of Ashiyana Goa heads up the Ashiyana Brazil team</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528541866/hguscffrshlo4lawihug.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ashiyana is a Hindi word meaning <i>home</i>, and it was precisely this sense of feeling at home that Chris had in mind when he founded Ashiyana Goa. The retreat has grown to become one of the most loved yoga and spa retreats in India, attracting 1000s of guests from all corners of the globe. The magic of the retreat though, lies beyond the beautiful design of the centre, the incredible beaches and the delicious, fresh food, and is rooted in the heartfelt desire for our guests to drop all of their worldly worries. This is clear to see in the beautiful smiling faces of the staff :)</p>

<p><br/><strong>When asked about his vision for Alto Paraiso, Brazil, Chris explained: </strong></p>
<p>Alto is a very special  place. It has an unassuming air, an understated beauty, and Mother Nature’s healing embrace is palpable. It's a truly unique location with exceptional bio-diversity, and its bedrock of crystals interwoven with rivers and waterfalls means that walks off the beaten track are truly spectacular.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534850218/zdqfbthlosu7fe82dfvz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Over the last few years, we've been slowly developing the land, planting trees, making wonderful friends and learning about the needs of the local community. We’d like to invite you to be part of our campaign, or what we’re calling our R3volution. With your help we’ll be able to implement the 3 Rs of our R3volution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>Relaxation </i>- Complete the building of the Retreat that will finance the other two elements moving forwards</strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Rehabilitation</i> - Build a community/workshop space for the Rehabilitation Project, which integrates men and women back into society following drug and alcohol abuse</strong></li>
<li>
<strong><i>Reforestation</i> - Prepare the 9Ha of our agro-forestry project land for further planting, and build a sheltered structure with store for the workers</strong><strong>​</strong><br/> </li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535379450/mrxuwwlhto4zceivauwb.jpg"" src=""""/></strong><br/><br/> </p>
<p>Our whole philosophy is based upon the creation of a <i>virtuous loop of sustainability</i> -</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the Retreat (<i><strong>Relaxation</strong></i>) is completed next summer, we'll be able to further fund the <i><strong>Rehabilitation</strong></i> and <i><strong>Reforestation</strong></i> elements of the project, as well as employ some of the workers who've been displaced from the fields by modern farming methods</li>
<li>Our agro-forestry project will employ the same men and women that have been rehabilitated back into society, and their labour will enable the sale of seeds, saplings and trees, providing funds for our other social projects</li>
<li>Our good friend Zizo, who lives on the land, is an expert in permaculture and agro-forestry, and with his help we hope to inspire many others to live in harmony with the land, teaching them that <i>o</i><i>ver-grazing, stripping of trees and seasonal burning, create long-term depletion of the land</i><br/> </li>

<p> </p>
<p>This is what we have achieved so far in Goa. Our intention is to expand upon this in Alto Paraiso, Brazil with our 3Rs. Whilst the projects in Goa are hugely supportive in the community, the size of our land in Alto Paraiso will enable us to take this to the next level!    </p>
<p><strong>Please support this opportunity - with your help and contributions we can both transform lives and continue the process of returning the land to its natural, verdant glory. Our perks include a range of experiences that you can enjoy as part of the journey. </strong></p>

<h3>With your help we can transform a community and the surrounding ecosystem. Our goal is modest:</h3>
<p>Our requirements in phase 1 have been carefully costed so you know exactly how your contribution will help. Much of this is construction, which in turn supports the community in and around Alto Paraiso.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: We require an initial cash injection of £50,000, which will be used as follows: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>£27,500 to complete 10 guest rooms</li>
<li>£7,500 for the rehabilitation project's workshop space</li>
<li>£5,000 to build the retreat's organically constructed yoga shala</li>
<li>£5,000 for final preparation of the 9Ha of land to be ready for further planting</li>
<li>£5,000 for a worker’s shelter which will also house equipment in a safe storage facility</li>
</ul>
<p>The completion of the guest rooms and yoga shala will enable the retreat to open for paying guests, which allows funding to begin for key parts of the social projects and the reforestation programme.</p>
<p><strong>Guests will be invited to help on the land if they wish, or those with relevant qualifications will be invited to assist with the rehabilitation and reforestation projects.</strong></p>
<p>We've put together some fabulous perks that we hope you'll be excited about...</p>
<ul>
<li>Generous discounts for retreat stays. During your stay you will have an opportunity to help on the land or with the social enterprise areas of the project.

<li>A one to one with Chris Nelson, who will talk you through the <i>SOAR</i> philosophy from his book <i>Wake Up and SOAR,</i> including tools for relaxation, optimal lifestyle hacks, and keys to being inspired and fulfilled</li>
<li>All of you who contribute will have your names imprinted on the entrance wall to the retreat, so that your kindness will never be forgotten</li>
</ul>
<p>If for whatever reason we don't hit out target, we'll ensure that all donations go towards the completion of the guest rooms, as this will ensure we have the means to generate income from paying guests to fund the other two of our Rs. This is our essential objective!</p>

<h3>Is there a risk?</h3>
<p>Some may view building and running a retreat in uncharted territory as a risky business, but rest assured that we've had 12 year's experience of running a successful retreat in Goa, India. Here's what Chris said about founding Ashiyana Goa:</p>
<p>""Whilst my intentions when buying the land were pretty humble, it seems that life had other ideas. Ashiyana has grown to become quite a substantial community - providing a home away from home to many thousands of guests, employment to 50, predominantly, local Indians, and support for a large array of social projects. Ashiyana has become the manifestation of a dream that I had a long time ago. But it has become so much more than I’d imagined, and because of the efforts of many people, and a few key people in particular, it is now a world-renowned yoga retreat and community that has spawned hundreds of yoga teachers, many thousands of happy guests, and is a fundamentally important element of the local community.""<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Welcome to our R3volution! 
Chris Nelson, author, entrepreneur, yoga teacher and the founder of Ashiyana Goa heads up the Ashiyana Brazil team
 

 
Ashiyana is a Hindi word meaning home, and it was precisely this sense of feeling at home that Chris had in mind when he founded Ashiyana Goa. The retreat has grown to become one of the most loved yoga and spa retreats in India, attracting 1000s of guests from all corners of the globe. The magic of the retreat though, lies beyond the beautiful design of the centre, the incredible beaches and the delicious, fresh food, and is rooted in the heartfelt desire for our guests to drop all of their worldly worries. This is clear to see in the beautiful smiling faces of the staff :)
With an eye for detail and his own published approach to wellbeing, Chris has created a unique experience for all who visit Ashiyana Goa.
 

 
Many of our guests are aware that Ashiyana is expanding and they're as excited as we are about the next Retreat opening in Brazil!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Who am I? </p>
<p>I'm a girl from Fort Bragg, who left for a decade or so to go to school in Humboldt County. While completing my college degrees in education, I worked in a restaurant with a staff that felt like family, and practiced Hot Yoga at a small, sweet studio. Little did I know the first time I walked into that studio 12 years ago that I was beginning a lifelong passion. </p>
<p>Regardless of what life has thrown at me, what continent or state I've been in, or what my current profession is, Hot Yoga has been my anchor in some otherwise tumultuous times. And it's like nothing other - there is no substitute. After moving back to my little hometown 4 years ago, I decided I needed to do whatever I could to build a hot studio here on the Mendocino Coast. </p>
<p>The summer after my second year teaching at a local charter school, I left to complete my teacher training with Evolation Yoga. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and that month of training helped me find an equanimity that I had been searching for my whole life. When I got home, I was ready to hit the ground running with studio ownership. However, my new husband and I decided that it would be the wise choice to start our family before a new business, which is exactly what we did! Our baby girl, Zeplyn Mae, was born last June, and being her mom has brought me SO much joy. </p>
<p>At 8 months old, she is so much of my WHY. She is the main reason I am so driven to fulfill my dream of studio ownership - not only because I want to show her that dreams can come true with hard work and dedication, but I also want to create a community that is centered around self-care and wellness, that supports families, that demonstrates to her what a healthy work-life balance looks like. I want to create a space for respectful, constructive discourse in our often volatile public dialogue, and hold workshops for adolescents that are trying to figure out who they are. I want to create something that is beautiful, dynamic, and full of diverse personalities that nonetheless treat each other with kindness, respect, and compassion. In short, I want to create something that I am proud to share with my daughter, and that will send ripples of wellness out into our small community. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help provide all of the features that will make this studio so incredible. First off, a heating system that will consistently achieve the desired 105* for Hot Yoga (you yogis know this is CRUCIAL), while also allowing for air flow to keep air fresh despite the heat. After getting suuuuuper sweaty during  Hot Yoga (or hot pilates, or line dancing, or TRX) class, students can rinse off in our awesome new showers before leaving to go run all of their other errands in town. Especially in such a rural community, where folks often drive in from surrounding, remote areas for their shopping, school pick-ups and drop-offs, workdays, etc., being able to squeeze in a workout without having to walk around sweaty all day is pretty amazing. After getting all cleaned up, and before heading over to the grocery store (or laundromat, or the bank...), students will be able to get a protein shake or smoothie, a nice cold glass of kombucha on tap, or a light snack and coffee. In addition to providing the workout, the showers, and the fuel, your contribution will help build the ONLY studio in town that plans to offer drop-in childcare to those taking class. I plan to offer this within 3 months of opening the doors, to accommodate all of the mamas out there with babies who aren't yet in school. And with more funds coming from crowdfunding and less from loans, this can happen sooner rather than later! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So - here's the scoop!</p>
<ul>
<li>The $70,000 goal is based on my projections for opening costs, plus 2 months of operating costs, so that everything can run as smoothly as possible as soon as doors are open! Here is the breakdown of exactly where all of it is going:<ul>
<li>$15,000 is for the heating system - the infrared heating system is not only super high quality, but it is also low energy consumption, and much easier to install (and cleaner!) than a forced-air system. </li>
<li>$20,000 is for theshowersand café plumbing – I know, it’s a lot, but the showers are SUCH a key piece of this, and long term, it makes much more sense to install them now – and do the café plumbing while we’re at it. Otherwise, the studio will have to close to get into the concrete subfloor in a year or two, and that isn’t good for anyone! </li>
<li>$10,000 is for 2 months of operating costs, things like heat, water, rent, insurance, payroll, and the like. This way, in case things start off slow, there's an opportunity to save the first 2 months of revenue to go towards the 3rd month! </li>
<li>$10,000 is for platform fees, reserve funds that they hold to protect you all, and shipping for swag! </li>
<li>$5,000 is for all of the other construction-type modifications – lighting upgrade, new windows, bathroom vanity, café counters, etc.  </li>
<li>$5,000 is the cost of ourequipment– dishware, yoga mats (made from recycled wetsuits – so cool!), towels for rent, kombucha kegerator, mirrors, curtains, toilet paper, you get the picture – all the “stuff.” </li>
<li>$5,000 is left over for all the other stuff we don’t even know we need yet, or the unexpected stuff – permitting fees, licensing, ambiance, the finishing touches. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our perks contain some pretty cool stuff - handmade glass straws, SoulFire gear, and best of all, a chance to try some of our awesome classes at a lower rate than our regular membership! </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>And if we don't raise it all? <p>Simple – we start small.We’ve raised almost $17,000 at this point, so we have about $53,000 to go. I really think we can do it. But if not? We have enough for the basics – for the heat, the floors, and our permits to open the doors. And we’re totally ok with starting there if need be. BUT, we’d rather make it so you can shower after your class, and have dressing rooms, and a nice refreshing beverage. Doesn’t that sound so much better? </p>
<p>We need your help to make it happen though! So if you can, chip is $5, $10, whatever you can – every little bit helps. And tell your friends! This is a project BY the community, FOR the community. I think of it as a barn raising – you help us raise our roof, and we’ll be around to help you raise yours when the time comes. </p>
<p>Because that’s what community does.</p>
</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>In all comes down to creating a better world. With everything going on around us, making a difference in our immediate communities and lives is where real change begins. So, I'm starting with me. I'm building a business that is ethically sourced - that uses local materials and labor, recycled or responsibly produced goods, and that strives for zero waste. The cafe will not supply disposable dishware or cups, encouraging patrons to instead bring their own, or pay an extra $1 for something reusable that they can take with them. </li>
<li>I'm hiring people to lead classes from all walks of life for all kinds of people - not just the typical, fit young people you see leading the classes at most gyms (tho I do have some of those too!) My instructors come in all shapes and sizes and ages, and I love that about them. They have very different specialties, personalities, and histories, and these are all things that benefit the studio, and the community. </li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Who am I? 
I'm a girl from Fort Bragg, who left for a decade or so to go to school in Humboldt County. While completing my college degrees in education, I worked in a restaurant with a staff that felt like family, and practiced Hot Yoga at a small, sweet studio. Little did I know the first time I walked into that studio 12 years ago that I was beginning a lifelong passion. 
Regardless of what life has thrown at me, what continent or state I've been in, or what my current profession is, Hot Yoga has been my anchor in some otherwise tumultuous times. And it's like nothing other - there is no substitute. After moving back to my little hometown 4 years ago, I decided I needed to do whatever I could to build a hot studio here on the Mendocino Coast. 
The summer after my second year teaching at a local charter school, I left to complete my teacher training with Evolation Yoga. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and that month of training helped me find an equanimity that I had been searching for my whole life. When I got home, I was ready to hit the ground running with studio ownership. However, my new husband and I decided that it would be the wise choice to start our family before a new business, which is exactly what we did! Our baby girl, Zeplyn Mae, was born last June, and being her mom has brought me SO much joy. 
At 8 months old, she is so much of my WHY. She is the main reason I am so driven to fulfill my dream of studio ownership - not only because I want to show her that dreams can come true with hard work and dedication, but I also want to create a community that is centered around self-care and wellness, that supports families, that demonstrates to her what a healthy work-life balance looks like. I want to create a space for respectful, constructive discourse in our often volatile public dialogue, and hold workshops for adolescents that are trying to figure out who they are. I want to create something that is beautiful, dynamic, and full of diverse personalities that nonetheless treat each other with kindness, respect, and compassion. In short, I want to create something that I am proud to share with my daughter, and that will send ripples of wellness out into our small community. 
Your contribution will help provide all of the features that will make this studio so incredible. First off, a heating system that will consistently achieve the desired 105* for Hot Yoga (you yogis know this is CRUCIAL), while also allowing for air flow to keep air fresh despite the heat. After getting suuuuuper sweaty during  Hot Yoga (or hot pilates, or line dancing, or TRX) class, students can rinse off in our awesome new showers before leaving to go run all of their other errands in town. Especially in such a rural community, where folks often drive in from surrounding, remote areas for their shopping, school pick-ups and drop-offs, workdays, etc., being able to squeeze in a workout without having to walk around sweaty all day is pretty amazing. After getting all cleaned up, and before heading over to the grocery store (or laundromat, or the bank...), students will be able to get a protein shake or smoothie, a nice cold glass of kombucha on tap, or a light snack and coffee. In addition to providing the workout, the showers, and the fuel, your contribution will help build the ONLY studio in town that plans to offer drop-in childcare to those taking class. I plan to offer this within 3 months of opening the doors, to accommodate all of the mamas out there with babies who aren't yet in school. And with more funds coming from crowdfunding and less from loans, this can happen sooner rather than later! 
 

What We Need & What You Get
So - here's the scoop!

The $70,000 goal is based on my projections for opening costs, plus 2 months of operating costs, so that everything can run as smoothly as possible as soon as doors are open! Here is the breakdown of exactly where all of it is going:
$15,000 is for the heating system - the infrared heating system is not only super high quality, but it is also low energy consumption, and much easier to install (and cleaner!) than a forced-air system. 
$20,000 is for theshowersand café plumbing – I know, it’s a lot, but the showers are SUCH a key piece of this, and long term, it makes much more sense to install them now – and do the café plumbing while we’re at it. Otherwise, the studio will have to close to get into the concrete subfloor in a year or two, and that isn’t good for anyone! 
$10,000 is for 2 months of operating costs, things like heat, water, rent, insurance, payroll, and the like. This way, in case things start off slow, there's an opportunity to save the first 2 months of revenue to go towards the 3rd month! 
$10,000 is for platform fees, reserve funds that they hold to protect you all, and shipping for swag! 
$5,000 is for all of the other construction-type modifications – lighting upgrade, new windows, bathroom vanity, café counters, etc.  
$5,000 is the cost of ourequipment– dishware, yoga mats (made from recycled wetsuits – so cool!), towels for rent, kombucha kegerator, mirrors, curtains, toilet paper, you get the picture – all the “stuff.” 
$5,000 is left over for all the other stuff we don’t even know we need yet, or the unexpected stuff – permitting fees, licensing, ambiance, the finishing touches. 


Our perks contain some pretty cool stuff - handmade glass straws, SoulFire gear, and best of all, a chance to try some of our awesome classes at a lower rate than our regular membership! 

And if we don't raise it all? Simple – we start small.We’ve raised almost $17,000 at this point, so we have about $53,000 to go. I really think we can do it. But if not? We have enough for the basics – for the heat, the floors, and our permits to open the doors. And we’re totally ok with starting there if need be. BUT, we’d rather make it so you can shower after your class, and have dressing rooms, and a nice refreshing beverage. Doesn’t that sound so much better? 
We need your help to make it happen though! So if you can, chip is $5, $10, whatever you can – every little bit helps. And tell your friends! This is a project BY the community, FOR the community. I think of it as a barn raising – you help us raise our roof, and we’ll be around to help you raise yours when the time comes. 
Because that’s what community does.


The Impact

In all comes down to creating a better world. With everything going on around us, making a difference in our immediate communities and lives is where real change begins. So, I'm starting with me. I'm building a business that is ethically sourced - that uses local materials and labor, recycled or responsibly produced goods, and that strives for zero waste. The cafe will not supply disposable dishware or cups, encouraging patrons to instead bring their own, or pay an extra $1 for something reusable that they can take with them. 
I'm hiring people to lead classes from all walks of life for all kinds of people - not just the typical, fit young people you see leading the classes at most gyms (tho I do have some of those too!) My instructors come in all shapes and sizes and ages, and I love that about them. They have very different specialties, personalities, and histories, and these are all things that benefit the studio, and the community. 
I want to give back. I want to provide a resource for self-care for those struggling with addiction, those struggling to find themselves, and those that are just having a hard time finding a balance in their lives. I want to offer work-trade for low-income teenagers and parents, who can't afford the usual boutique yoga experience. I want to be the anchor that my home studio was for me, for so many years. 

Although this is my first time owning a yoga studio, I'm no stranger to new things. I've worked my way through a BA, 2 teaching credentials, and an MA. I've rebuilt my truck and my home, and my heart in the process. I've backpacked through Patagonia, hitchhiked through the Argentine Desert, driven through Mexico, and ridden my bike, alone, down the East Coast. I'm no stranger to hard work, and I've had a few falls and setbacks, but I know how to work hard, how to persevere,  and how to ask for help. 
There is no Plan B. I grew up with the old adage that when there's a will there's a way, and I am hellbent on creating this for myself and most importantly, for my daughter. But, it'll be a whole lot easier with your help!

I was one of the original supporters.""So Thank You, Dear One, for Your Support!Love and Light,~ Ulrike",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I've been a mum for almost 27 years now and it's been the most rewarding yet challenging journey of my life. I lost my mum to heart failure just before my 19th birthday she was just 37, I was devastated. My family pretty much fell apart from that moment on and I had to rely on myself. I was taking care of everyone, I already had a son who was two by that time, my sister was 14, my brother 18, and my father became an alcoholic. I guess that's part of the reason I care so much about people, but really I learned it from my mum, she cared deeply about people. </p><p>As life developed I became a single mum with three very energetic and boisterous boys, it was challenging at times and the stress I felt was immense. I knew I had to do something to not only combat stress, but look after myself. The threat of dying from a heart attack young and leaving my boys behind was a very real fear for me, I'd seen it happen to my mum and I believed if I didn't do something to look after myself in some way it was a real possibility it would happen to me. </p><p>I began to develop a bedtime routine, after the long day and the stresses and strains had subsided and the boys were finally in bed I would sit in the quiet, switch off the TV, switch most of the lights off, light a candle and begin a skincare routine. I would really take time to massage my face, breathing deeply taking in the smells. Relax my mind, massage my arms and across my shoulders, I love to smell the scent as I fall asleep. Ahh the smell of Rose takes me to a place of peace. I would then massage my legs a little, we all know how good that feels after a long busy day, oh gosh just heaven. I didn't know it then, but what I was doing was more than dealing with stress levels, I was taking care of my well-being, taking care of myself, loving myself, making my self matter.</p><p>I didn't know then that routine was going to change my life. Every single moment of that routine was going to matter deeply to me as I developed and my life went through different stages. I didn't realise how important the silence was going to become I just had the need for a little quiet after dealing with three noisy boys, little did I know that it was what would keep me sane. I couldn't know back then how important those scents would become, oh boy I love amazing scents, I came to learn what effect different scents have on us and how they help our well-being. I couldn't even begin to imagine just how significant taking 10 to 20 minutes to yourself at the end of a long day, to pamper and take care of yourself would be. This made me feel loved, important, I mattered to me. I slept better, I felt better, I was able to cope with stress better, heck I even felt happier and more positive. I developed a love of skincare and lifestyle products and began to notice a huge difference in not just the look and feel of my skin, also how I felt inside. </p><p>This is why I developed Elise Marques London, I learned I matter and I want you to remember that You Matter. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What's Inside Our Products:</strong></p><p> </p><p>We are excited to get our highly anticipated products into your hands, on your faces and bodies!</p><p>We are true advocates here at Elise Marques London, we love what we do and we believe that by sticking true to our values and principles, our uniqueness will seamlessly shine through our products.</p><p>Your purchase not only means a lot to us, but it benefits you as well.

We sometimes use fragrances/perfumes which are often actually safer than essential oils especially for some very sensitive skins.

Our primary concern is the safety of customers as we know nature in its purist form isn’t always ideal, however, having a sensible approach, for example some of the alcohols are naturally derived such as Benzyl Alcohol.

<p>The purpose of this trip is to bring attention to the public health benefit that community bathhouses and saunas have to offer by restoring a sense of belonging and creativity. At the centre is the relationship with water and nature, which is vital in these times of ecological and human degradation and distress. The journey will highlight and celebrate the stories and the people who embrace this way of life, while inspiring what is possible by building a steam sauna culture in Nova Scotia. The cold damp climate here points to an obvious need to gather in warm cozy spaces!</p>
<p>At this time isolation, speed, disease, nature deprivation, depression, increased exhaustion and burnout, are on the rise. There has never been a greater need or opportunity to create accessible places where people can gather to cleanse, rest, and take a much needed break from screen time. </p>
<p>The journey is mapped out and you can follow us as we steam and document our way through Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Iceland. Find us on social media! There will be a final video of the journey, eventually finding its way into a book.</p>
<p> I am offering theatrical story telling and poems from my sweat pilgrimages in Asia and Europe during the tour and inviting conversation and impressions on experiences and why these places matter.</p>
<p><strong>Your Support</strong></p>
<p>Your financial support is invaluable to me and Steam Space. Every dollar raised will help with:</p>
<p>* Training — On this trip, I will deepen my practice in a sauna offering and treatment through additional training. I look forward to offering this more widely upon my return!</p>
<p>* Travel costs</p>
<p>* Camera</p>
<p>* Insurance</p>
<p>* Accommodations</p>
<p>* Entrance fees</p>
<p>If Steam Space exceeds its target, the funds will go towards the Steam Dream fund to ground a ‘home' for Steam Space. This new home will introduce the first communal steam sauna bathing spa to Nova Scotia (small scale) and consistently accommodate more people by weaving together community health and water. </p>
<p>There are many ways to support this campaign regardless of your monetary situation. Simply sharing it is a huge contribution and very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Locals can enjoy Steam Space offerings such as body care treatments, aromatic infusions, gatherings, scrub mitts, tree brooms, and workshops.</p>
<p>Wherever you are in the world, you can receive a post card from the Steam Culture Tour! I can also connect you with the Baltic sea by saying your name and offering a stone in your honour.</p>

<h3>The Concept Behind GuideFul</h3>
<p>Justin Whitaker started teaching mindfulness meditation 14 years ago and he's taught students all over the world. One of his students was Bob Funk. Both Justin and Bob came to meditation to improve their mental wellness and find relief from anxiety. It worked and improved their lives in so many more ways, just like it has for so many millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>After meeting, Justin and Bob began work on a unique, accessible, and affordable meditation platform: GuideFul.</p>
<p>There are plenty of apps, CDs, and self-help books out there, but there isn’t a meditation platform that embraces community, coaching, and convenience.</p>
<p><strong>GuideFul brings all the important elements of a successful meditation practice into one place</strong>: meditation teachers, video tutorials, guided and live meditations, an online community, meditation check-ins, Q+A podcasts, a mobile app, and so much more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492203335/kes5i0ewmddf0lopwnrs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">According to the Mayo Clinic</a>, mindfulness meditation has been proven to </p>
<ul>
<li>help alleviate anxiety disorders, depression, and sleep disorders</li>
<li>boost creativity and cognitive processing</li>
<li>cultivate health habits and encourage weight loss</li>
<li>improve digestion and lower blood pressure</li>
<li>decrease the risk of heart attack</li>
<li>decrease the perception of pain</li>
</ul>
<p>We know and neuroscientists know that we <a href=""http://meditation-research.org.uk/2014/03/meditation-and-neuroplasticity-five-key-articles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>humans have the ability to literally shape our own minds</strong></a> through neuroplasticity. By practicing meditation, we can improve both our mental health and our physical health. Think of it this way: meditation is like a gym for the mind.</p>
<p><strong>And just like at a regular gym, most people stop going. That's why we've been developing GuideFul. </strong>A successful meditation practice is dependent upon motivation, guidance, support, and a community. GuideFul helps people stay on track and succeed in their meditation practice.</p>

</div></div>","The Concept Behind GuideFul
Justin Whitaker started teaching mindfulness meditation 14 years ago and he's taught students all over the world. One of his students was Bob Funk. Both Justin and Bob came to meditation to improve their mental wellness and find relief from anxiety. It worked and improved their lives in so many more ways, just like it has for so many millions of people around the world.
After meeting, Justin and Bob began work on a unique, accessible, and affordable meditation platform: GuideFul.
There are plenty of apps, CDs, and self-help books out there, but there isn’t a meditation platform that embraces community, coaching, and convenience.
GuideFul brings all the important elements of a successful meditation practice into one place: meditation teachers, video tutorials, guided and live meditations, an online community, meditation check-ins, Q+A podcasts, a mobile app, and so much more.


According to the Mayo Clinic, mindfulness meditation has been proven to 

help alleviate anxiety disorders, depression, and sleep disorders
boost creativity and cognitive processing
cultivate health habits and encourage weight loss
improve digestion and lower blood pressure
decrease the risk of heart attack
decrease the perception of pain

We know and neuroscientists know that we humans have the ability to literally shape our own minds through neuroplasticity. By practicing meditation, we can improve both our mental health and our physical health. Think of it this way: meditation is like a gym for the mind.
And just like at a regular gym, most people stop going. That's why we've been developing GuideFul. A successful meditation practice is dependent upon motivation, guidance, support, and a community. GuideFul helps people stay on track and succeed in their meditation practice.

My name is KEN and I have a dream that I am trying to turn into a reality. I want to establish a unique cemetery unlike any other in the USA, in a very unique town, unlike any other in the world: Pioneertown, CA. Before I tell you more about that dream, I want to make sure that you know where I am writing you from..</p><p>Pioneertown, USA is a small town in the High Deserts of southern California that forever changed the history of Western Cinema! The town was established in 1946, when actor Dick Curtis shared his dream for a “living breathing movie set”. Shortly afterwards, seventeen investors, including Curtis and his celebrity friends, Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, The Sons of the Pioneers, Russell Hayden and Bud Abbott, all invested and incorporated. They purchased 32,ooo acres of land with a simple goal: to create a place where they could all work and play with friends, family and co-workers. It was to be an 188o’s themed town which was easily accessible from both Los Angeles &amp; Palm Springs, that would serve as a fully functioning filming location, vacation destination &amp; permanent High Desert neighborhood!</p><p>The first structures established were fully functional businesses like the Land Office, White’s Grocery, the Townhouse Motel, the Red Dog Saloon, the Golden Stallion Restaurant, Maggie’s Feed Barn, Nell’s Ice Cream Palace, Pioneertown Likker, the Klip ‘N’ Kurl Beauty Shop, Pioneer Bowl, Trigger Bill’s Shooting Gallery &amp; the Pioneertown Gazette; just to name a few. Ranch sites with utilities soon to be available and road access already established were offered starting as low as $9oo for over an acre of land! Pioneertown became a legitimate town with its own zip code, an established community and big plans for expansion.</p><p>Pioneertown was a dream come true for Western film producers and soon caught the attention of numerous Hollywood studios. All six seasons of <i>The Cisco Kid</i>, all five seasons of <i>The Gene Autry Show</i>, all three seasons of <i>The Range Rider</i> &amp; the<i> Annie Oakley</i> show, both seasons of <i>Buffalo Bill Jr.</i> &amp; <i>26 Men </i>as well as the entire <i>Judge Roy Bean</i> series were all filmed or framed in Pioneertown<i>.</i> In addition to Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and The Sons of the Pioneers, the tiny town was host to actors, producers and directors like Gene Autry, Philip N. Krasne, Frank McDonald, Spencer Bennet, Rex Blair, Armand Schaefer, John English, John Sturges, George Archainbaud, Duncan Renaldo, Leo Carrillo, Minna Gombelle, Pat Buttram, Smiley Burnette, Gail Davis, Frank Richards, Gloria Henry, Robert Livingston, Jack O'Mahoney, Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan, Ralph Meeker, Peggy Stewart, Dickie Moore, William Fawcett, Kirby Grant, James Griffith, Lew Ayres, Teresa Wright, Thurston Hall, Harry Lauter, Anne James and many, many more.</p><p>You will find that Pioneertown’s Mane Street, the heart of the town, where only horse an foot traffic is allowed, is only a few city blocks long. Businesses here have dwindled and thrived, back and forth. But the die-hard community has always remained committed to keeping Pioneertown alive. And while a demand for western filming locations has died down, the town is still a fully functioning production set where movies, independent films, music videos and commercials are filmed every month. Today, Mane Street in Pioneertown still retains its charm and Old West image. Visitors are welcome to come enjoy Pioneertown any day of the week; but weekends are when the town really comes to life!</p><p>Retail stores and art studios are located on Mane Street and the Pioneertown Corrals Campground is right around the corner. There are also numerous false fronts in town, like the Bank, Bath House, Jail, Saloon and the Mining Corporation. They are great for pictures, fun for kids and a wonderful distraction to help you forget about the hustle of the big city. You can even catch a gunfight on Mane Street during most of the warmer weekends! Just about everyone who comes to Pioneertown visits the local restaurant/bar, Pappy and Harriet’s Pioneertown Palace, or “Pappy &amp; Harriet's”, as the locals call it.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540109399/vx6oxxyo5udoixadzll6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""center""><strong><u>WHY:</u></strong></p><p>Now.. that dream I am trying to turn into a reality, that I was talking about earlier.. I want to establish a cemetery in Pioneertown!</p><p>Over the years, Pioneertown found itself in the hands of several different owners, before being divided up into the privately-owned properties that it is today. But there has never been a cemetery planned for the town! The nearest cemeteries, and actually some of the <i>only</i> cemeteries in southern California’s High Desert, are down in Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms. At Pioneertown’s level of fame, with its community’s degree of passion and with the town’s overall level of western American tradition.. Doesn’t it make sense that there should be a cemetery in Pioneertown? Just think of the number of celebrities and members of the community, both past and present, who would have enjoyed being able to enjoy Pioneertown forever!</p><p>Furthermore, focusing on the original theme of the town, <strong>Creative Synergy</strong>, said cemetery should have a unique dual purpose. . .</p><p>While there is plenty to do, see and enjoy in Pioneertown - Its residents, its visitors and Mane Street in particular, could truly benefit from a few extra amenities which the town currently does not have. With all of this in mind, I have formed a new corporation in the great State of California with the task of designing, developing, maintaining, promoting and ultimately preserving, indefinitely, the Pioneertown Preservation Park Project: a cemetery unlike any other in the world!</p><p>The Pioneertown Preservation Park Project (P4) intends to harvest the greatest past and present internment designs and technology to allow for maximum use of both space and resources. In addition to this, P4 aims to incorporate a revolutionary long-term cemetery financing plan by offering, from the start, amenities which present day cemeteries are only starting to offer. Said amenities should synergistically benefit both residents of and visitors to Pioneertown. In correlation with the numerous potential non-traditional amenities that P4 aims to offer, this necropolis intends to have a goal unlike many modern-day burial grounds: The celebration and preservation of life; both before and after death. <strong>Think of a Cemetery that also acts like a community center. Well- that’s exactly what P4 is going for!</strong></p><p>This campaign is one of P4’s first major steps towards trying to establish a cemetery in Pioneertown. It is also your chance to help contribute to what will be one of the most unique and celebrated cemeteries in the USA!</p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540109624/huaw9lpzy1kxukcascmf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""center""><strong><u>HOW:</u></strong></p><p>P4 has some pretty big goals. A lot of work has already been done and momentum is building; but there is a <i>lot</i> more work to do before the ball can really start to roll. A plan has been established and further funding is needed to help P4 reach the next levels of research, development and overall capitalization.</p><p>A website has been created to help everyone understand P4’s numerous ideas, goals, plans and the cool Backer Rewards that P4 has come up with.

My name is KEN and I have a dream that I am trying to turn into a reality. I want to establish a unique cemetery unlike any other in the USA, in a very unique town, unlike any other in the world: Pioneertown, CA. Before I tell you more about that dream, I want to make sure that you know where I am writing you from..Pioneertown, USA is a small town in the High Deserts of southern California that forever changed the history of Western Cinema! The town was established in 1946, when actor Dick Curtis shared his dream for a “living breathing movie set”. Shortly afterwards, seventeen investors, including Curtis and his celebrity friends, Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, The Sons of the Pioneers, Russell Hayden and Bud Abbott, all invested and incorporated. They purchased 32,ooo acres of land with a simple goal: to create a place where they could all work and play with friends, family and co-workers. It was to be an 188o’s themed town which was easily accessible from both Los Angeles & Palm Springs, that would serve as a fully functioning filming location, vacation destination & permanent High Desert neighborhood!The first structures established were fully functional businesses like the Land Office, White’s Grocery, the Townhouse Motel, the Red Dog Saloon, the Golden Stallion Restaurant, Maggie’s Feed Barn, Nell’s Ice Cream Palace, Pioneertown Likker, the Klip ‘N’ Kurl Beauty Shop, Pioneer Bowl, Trigger Bill’s Shooting Gallery & the Pioneertown Gazette; just to name a few. Ranch sites with utilities soon to be available and road access already established were offered starting as low as $9oo for over an acre of land! Pioneertown became a legitimate town with its own zip code, an established community and big plans for expansion.Pioneertown was a dream come true for Western film producers and soon caught the attention of numerous Hollywood studios. All six seasons of The Cisco Kid, all five seasons of The Gene Autry Show, all three seasons of The Range Rider & the Annie Oakley show, both seasons of Buffalo Bill Jr. & 26 Men as well as the entire Judge Roy Bean series were all filmed or framed in Pioneertown. In addition to Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and The Sons of the Pioneers, the tiny town was host to actors, producers and directors like Gene Autry, Philip N. Krasne, Frank McDonald, Spencer Bennet, Rex Blair, Armand Schaefer, John English, John Sturges, George Archainbaud, Duncan Renaldo, Leo Carrillo, Minna Gombelle, Pat Buttram, Smiley Burnette, Gail Davis, Frank Richards, Gloria Henry, Robert Livingston, Jack O'Mahoney, Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan, Ralph Meeker, Peggy Stewart, Dickie Moore, William Fawcett, Kirby Grant, James Griffith, Lew Ayres, Teresa Wright, Thurston Hall, Harry Lauter, Anne James and many, many more.You will find that Pioneertown’s Mane Street, the heart of the town, where only horse an foot traffic is allowed, is only a few city blocks long. Businesses here have dwindled and thrived, back and forth. But the die-hard community has always remained committed to keeping Pioneertown alive. And while a demand for western filming locations has died down, the town is still a fully functioning production set where movies, independent films, music videos and commercials are filmed every month. Today, Mane Street in Pioneertown still retains its charm and Old West image. Visitors are welcome to come enjoy Pioneertown any day of the week; but weekends are when the town really comes to life!Retail stores and art studios are located on Mane Street and the Pioneertown Corrals Campground is right around the corner. There are also numerous false fronts in town, like the Bank, Bath House, Jail, Saloon and the Mining Corporation. They are great for pictures, fun for kids and a wonderful distraction to help you forget about the hustle of the big city. You can even catch a gunfight on Mane Street during most of the warmer weekends! Just about everyone who comes to Pioneertown visits the local restaurant/bar, Pappy and Harriet’s Pioneertown Palace, or “Pappy & Harriet's”, as the locals call it.WHY:Now.. that dream I am trying to turn into a reality, that I was talking about earlier.. I want to establish a cemetery in Pioneertown!Over the years, Pioneertown found itself in the hands of several different owners, before being divided up into the privately-owned properties that it is today. But there has never been a cemetery planned for the town! The nearest cemeteries, and actually some of the only cemeteries in southern California’s High Desert, are down in Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms. At Pioneertown’s level of fame, with its community’s degree of passion and with the town’s overall level of western American tradition.. Doesn’t it make sense that there should be a cemetery in Pioneertown? Just think of the number of celebrities and members of the community, both past and present, who would have enjoyed being able to enjoy Pioneertown forever!Furthermore, focusing on the original theme of the town, Creative Synergy, said cemetery should have a unique dual purpose. . .While there is plenty to do, see and enjoy in Pioneertown - Its residents, its visitors and Mane Street in particular, could truly benefit from a few extra amenities which the town currently does not have. With all of this in mind, I have formed a new corporation in the great State of California with the task of designing, developing, maintaining, promoting and ultimately preserving, indefinitely, the Pioneertown Preservation Park Project: a cemetery unlike any other in the world!The Pioneertown Preservation Park Project (P4) intends to harvest the greatest past and present internment designs and technology to allow for maximum use of both space and resources. In addition to this, P4 aims to incorporate a revolutionary long-term cemetery financing plan by offering, from the start, amenities which present day cemeteries are only starting to offer. Said amenities should synergistically benefit both residents of and visitors to Pioneertown. In correlation with the numerous potential non-traditional amenities that P4 aims to offer, this necropolis intends to have a goal unlike many modern-day burial grounds: The celebration and preservation of life; both before and after death. Think of a Cemetery that also acts like a community center. Well- that’s exactly what P4 is going for!This campaign is one of P4’s first major steps towards trying to establish a cemetery in Pioneertown. It is also your chance to help contribute to what will be one of the most unique and celebrated cemeteries in the USA!HOW:P4 has some pretty big goals. A lot of work has already been done and momentum is building; but there is a lot more work to do before the ball can really start to roll. A plan has been established and further funding is needed to help P4 reach the next levels of research, development and overall capitalization.A website has been created to help everyone understand P4’s numerous ideas, goals, plans and the cool Backer Rewards that P4 has come up with. Check out  www.PioneertownPreservationPark.com to see more information on the project!We also have a Facebook Group Page. If you want to help out but don’t feel like using Indiegogo, please share that website or our Facebook Page with your friends & family.Word of mouth is, and always has been, very powerful!The Crowdfunded $5,5oo will be used as follows:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello , my name is Brian Michetti.    I am a surfer from the 70's in Northern California. I first came here in 2001 . I have been living here in Peru for about seven years now with my 2 small children. I came to this famous location specifically to fulfill my childhood dream of this beach. Most of those years I spent here surfing Chicama, the longest wave in the world. Now I want to help share this amazing wave with the rest of the world, so I opened a hostal on the beach (also because i needed income).</p>
<p>IN March of 2017, NORTHERN PERU  suffered severe flooding, paralyzing the country for a few weeks. We are still recovering from this natural disaster.  The city is rebuilding the entire beachfront of this town. It will be finished and reopened in january of 2018. Until then we need help making ends meet. We are still open but our main entrance is blocked by construction, thus our income has been cut in half.  </p>
<p>By helping us now, we can survive this disaster and grow firmly into the  fantastic hostal we were meant to be. I can live my dream and provide an incredible future for my children for decades to come, future tourists can have fine dining and excellent accomodations here in this not so comfortable part of the world. We provide alot to our fellow surfer and backpacker to help them live their dreams as well..</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will break it down for you folks in more detail:</p>
<ul><li>We are looking for about $3,500 usd. Every month we are short about  $800 us dollars just to pay the bare minimum of expenses, utilities and food and medicines and costs to run the hostel, wages, etc..  So if we can get september, october, november and decembers' losses covered then we can stretch to january and expect an increase in sales as the new beachfront opens up to the town and surrounding communities justin time for its summer crowds.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let me explain more about my campaign and let you all know the difference your contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>My project will bring peace to my family.  It will provide much needed relief for us and allow more quality time with my children. Being a single parent in a foreign country has its challenges and can take its toll.  I have diabetes and have been told that stress is a major contributor to this disease. I love my life here and just need a bit of help for a few months. i have worked hard all my life and this would reinforce my faith in humanity.</li>
<li>When I first came here from California in 2001,  I had a desire to become part of the community. I bought property and hired locals to construct additions. I have since become well integrated amongst the local community. My Hostal business has contributed greatly to the local community which is extremely poor. More poor than you have probably ever seen first hand. We are constantly working with everyone here to provide better lives, and jobs. This town is small and isolated, the locals know little about a modern day world and we do what we can to bring the two worlds together. They have helped me raise my children and taught me what life is really about, i have found a greater purpose and i treasure it. i came here to surf the longest wave in the world and what i  received was far above that of my wildest dreams.</li>
<li>I will be able to pay the employees in a much more timely manner. This relieves much stress for them and their families. This  project will help many people and their families.</li>
<li>I was receiving help from my mother since the flooding struck us in March. She has now become seriously ill and can no longer do anything more. I asked my daughter for a bit of money and she, being so eager to help came up with this information. i must now try it as i have exhausted all my other options. </li>
<li>This project will help keep my immigration status current and legal for me and my 2 children.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><p>i hope you value my transparency. i dont have much time to prepare these campaigns, i work 7 days a week all day long, runnning the hostal and its restaurant and raising my two children. I wish i had the time to provide more details, more adjectives and more love. if you ever make it down here you will be treated well, so very well, as all our guests are treated.  </p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>i would ask you to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li>Remember , you too can to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>

We are still recovering from this natural disaster.  The city is rebuilding the entire beachfront of this town. It will be finished and reopened in january of 2018. Until then we need help making ends meet. We are still open but our main entrance is blocked by construction, thus our income has been cut in half.  
By helping us now, we can survive this disaster and grow firmly into the  fantastic hostal we were meant to be. I can live my dream and provide an incredible future for my children for decades to come, future tourists can have fine dining and excellent accomodations here in this not so comfortable part of the world. We provide alot to our fellow surfer and backpacker to help them live their dreams as well..

What We Need & What You Get
I will break it down for you folks in more detail:
We are looking for about $3,500 usd. Every month we are short about  $800 us dollars just to pay the bare minimum of expenses, utilities and food and medicines and costs to run the hostel, wages, etc..  So if we can get september, october, november and decembers' losses covered then we can stretch to january and expect an increase in sales as the new beachfront opens up to the town and surrounding communities justin time for its summer crowds.

The Impact
Let me explain more about my campaign and let you all know the difference your contribution will make:

My project will bring peace to my family.  It will provide much needed relief for us and allow more quality time with my children. Being a single parent in a foreign country has its challenges and can take its toll.  I have diabetes and have been told that stress is a major contributor to this disease. I love my life here and just need a bit of help for a few months. i have worked hard all my life and this would reinforce my faith in humanity.
When I first came here from California in 2001,  I had a desire to become part of the community. I bought property and hired locals to construct additions. I have since become well integrated amongst the local community. My Hostal business has contributed greatly to the local community which is extremely poor. More poor than you have probably ever seen first hand. We are constantly working with everyone here to provide better lives, and jobs. This town is small and isolated, the locals know little about a modern day world and we do what we can to bring the two worlds together. They have helped me raise my children and taught me what life is really about, i have found a greater purpose and i treasure it. i came here to surf the longest wave in the world and what i  received was far above that of my wildest dreams.
I will be able to pay the employees in a much more timely manner. This relieves much stress for them and their families. This  project will help many people and their families.
I was receiving help from my mother since the flooding struck us in March. She has now become seriously ill and can no longer do anything more. I asked my daughter for a bit of money and she, being so eager to help came up with this information. i must now try it as i have exhausted all my other options. 
This project will help keep my immigration status current and legal for me and my 2 children.

i hope you value my transparency. i dont have much time to prepare these campaigns, i work 7 days a week all day long, runnning the hostal and its restaurant and raising my two children. I wish i had the time to provide more details, more adjectives and more love. if you ever make it down here you will be treated well, so very well, as all our guests are treated.

<h3>Welcome! </h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Tracey Price. I live British Columbia and have a love for children (who doesn't right?!) Particularly and not exclusive, the 3 to 5 years old's that attend my school in Entebbe, Uganda. </p>
<p>""<i>How does a woman from BC open a school in Uganda</i>"" you're probably thinking.. Well, I also love to run marathons.. health and wellness are passions of mine. I was in South Africa for race several years ago and after the race I traveled a bit. When i was visiting Entebbe, I noticed that many of the young children where just hanging around when what in my mind should have been a school day. I quickly found out that there were few schools they could attend and cost was another barrier. Immediately I set out to open a school. </p>
<p>Today, over a hundred 3 to 5 year old's attend St. Micheal's school each year. We are proud of our achievement and want to build upon that success.  </p>
<p><strong>OUR WHY</strong></p>
<p>Recently, it dawned on the me that should something happen to me, the school would close since I'm the school's sole source of funding. </p>
<p>And that is how Price Wellness House (PWH) was born. In the fall of 2015, the idea of financial sustainability put me in the direction of assembling a team to create a center that would provide health and wellness education as well as medical care for local women with AIDS/HIV. The business model is to market services that would cover Price Wellness House's and St. Micheal's operation costs. Making St. Micheal's school the beneficiary of PWH's success. Your contribution funds St. Micheals school  indefinitely, no more annual funding drives! </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487019673/myshnmacfvkpcvozxs1k.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>TAKING ACTION</strong></p>
<p>Last fall and winter, celebrity designer Emmanuel Belliveau from Toronto, headed up the task of designing the center. Together with Amon (architect in Uganda), they finalized the drawings,  applied for building permits and began construction earlier this year. </p>
<p>I took the team to the Uganda this past November to check in on the progress. Emmanuel verified all the plans and got to meet Amon for the first time in person. Amon, is a huge asset to this team, as through him we were able to hire 14 locals to build the structure. It was very important for us to hire locals as they should benefit as much as possible from PWH presence. I'm happy to report the structure is coming along beautifully and I am so excited about what this means for many locals.</p>
<p><strong>HOW THE COMMUNITY, LOCAL AND AT LARGE </strong><b>BENEFIT</b></p>
<p>With 8 guests rooms, learning center, kitchen, fitness center, roof top deck for sunrise and sunset yoga and outdoor pool we plan to host retreats; Yoga, mindfulness, safari, nutrition, NGO's, Corporate etc..</p>
<p>The medical clinic will be run 4 days a week by a private doctor and then 3 days a week as a free community clinic. The host and their guests will be invited to do some community interaction through special classes held at the center for locals to participate in as well as going to the school to interact with the children. Our large kitchen will give guests the opportunity to cook lunch for the kids too should they wish. Our learning centre will offer vocational courses for local women to enter the work force or possibly start their own business. We feel there is so  much potential with this center that the current ideas we have are just touching the surface of what is actually possible once the center is complete by your funding.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help not only locals, but those around the world seeking a way to contribute in a positive and uplifting way. We can't solve all the problems of the world all of the time, but we can be a positive influence most of the time. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Your money is going to build the physical building, it pays for materials, equipment and labour. Any extra money that is collected beyond our goal will be set aside to purchase the property next door as we have another goal of adding more guest rooms and meeting rooms. Guests rooms in Entebbe are hard to come by, so we know we can generate extra revenue for PWH by renting to groups like the UN and NGO personel.  Long term, we'd like to duplicate this model in other cities/countries. </p>
<p>Our goal is to have an opening ceremony in Sept of 2017. Construction is moving well, however as with any international project there have been a few minor delays with equipment availability. Common building materials like wood are hard to come by and are as much as 3 times more expensive, so we are doing primarily concrete and brick construction. All of this work, including digging the concrete piers and foundation wall, is done by hand. Most equipment and finishing materials come in from Europe or the middle East, so cost are not surprisingly higher here.</p>
<p>We have great confidence in our team in Entebbe. Our contractor has great leadership and transparency. When possible, they have always presented multiple quotes for ongoing tenders and point out unnecessary cost by third party contractors. Corruption is very high in Uganda, yet with the local team we have in place, we've managed to avoid any major pitfalls. </p>

<h3>What is #MoreThanMyNumbers?</h3>
<p>This campaign was started by Kim ""Kimmay"" Caldwell, a bra fitter since 2005 and an advocate for women. Kimmay is devoted to helping women say hurray inside, outside, and underneath. Educating women on how to find a bra that fits well and feels great it just one way she helps women do that. And in the end, it all comes down to upgrading the conversations women are having with their bodies and themselves. </p>
<p>When Kimmay first started bra fitting, was was barely 20 years old. In the fitting rooms of NYC, she fit women for A to N cup sizes, 28 to 54 bands, elderly women, young girls, models, mothers, pregnant women, cancer survivors - you name it! And many of them were afraid of what the tag of their bra said, or the number on the measuring tape. Kimmay realized that she, along with the women she was meeting, were defining themselves by numbers. And not just bra size, but other numbers, too. Numbers like salary, age, weight, number of children, Instagram followers, etc. </p>
<p>The idea for the #MoreThanMyNumbers project started years ago when Kimmay first started her content marketing company. She was partnering with lingerie and intimates brands to upgrade the way they were talking to women, and creating educational and inspirational content with them. Kimmay realized that several of the brands she was working with shared her mission to empower women through undergarments and education. And she realized that so many women across the country and the world needed help to know their numbers, but not be defined by them. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When you support this campaign project, you are helping women (and men!) around the world get to know their numbers and release any definition from them.</p>
<p><strong>The first purpose and goal of the project is to educate.</strong> Through photo and video stories, women of different ages, heights, weights, abilities, and backgrounds will share their bra measurements and bra sizes, along with their stories around numbers. Just being able to see <strong>real women, with no photoshopping or airbrushing</strong>, sharing their <strong>actual measurements and sizing</strong> will help women understand bra sizing. Along with that, we're creating and upgrading<strong> tools to help women find their bra size</strong> starting points. These basic tools can empower a woman to find undergarments that help her stand tall, lead with her heart, and say hurray. I truly believe that when a woman honors and supports this sacred part of her body, she gains the <strong>confidence, love, and truth</strong> needed to go out in the world and make a difference. </p>
<p>The <strong>second purpose of the project is encourage women</strong> <strong>on the journey of making peace with their numbers</strong> - to help them understand that<strong> numbers are information, not a definition</strong>. Each woman's powerful story is different, and she is bravely stepping up to share it.</p>
<p>We have applicants from women who are a size 24 and riding an elephant in India, who are 47 and running their first marathon, who were divorced and now remarried and expecting, who were told they were ""fat at age 10 and now sharing her numbers with the world.</p>
<p><strong>These stories won't just inspire women. They will change the way that we look at beauty, support, and ""real"".</strong> Help us bring these stories to light. Help us create a powerful windstorm of support, education, and inspiration.</p>

<p>I'm Amy Mayo and I helped start Gable Heart Beats(GHB) in 2009 after my dear friend, Michael Gable (38), passed away unexpectedly from a Sudden Cardiac Arrest. Michael had Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart).  His diagnosis was missed because he didn't receive proper screening to detect his condition. An echocardiogram would have potentially saved his life. Two weeks after Michael passed away, his 11 month yr. old daughter (Grace Gable), went into heart failure and was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. Grace was in ICU for over a month fighting for her life. Michael's wife, Michelle Gable, and older brother Matteo, prayed for her healthy recovery. After a hard fight, Grace has recovered, plays soccer, and is almost at a normal heart level receiving ECHOs and EKGs regularly.  Often these conditions can be genetic which was the case with Michael and Grace. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>100% of the funds we raise go towards our heart screenings and AED placement in communities. For every $100 dollars raised, we can screen one person with and ECHO &amp; EKG at no charge. Normally the costs are approximately $1500 per person.  Gable Heart Beats is unique in our mission because we provide both an echocardiogram and EKG to everyone we screen. We feel strongly that both tests are necessary to rule out any heart conditions. </p>

<p>Heart screenings and AEDs have been proven to save lives. For every 200 people we screen, on average we have diagnosed 5 people with abnormal heart conditions that need to be referred to a cardiologist. The use of an AED before EMS arrival increases the odds of survival by 80 percent.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risks include a person finding out for the first time that they have a heart condition.  Often there are challenges when we screen someone and they have to undergo heart surgery or can't continue their previous life style. We prepare for these challenges by having the proper waivers and consent forms signed by adults/parents before receiving a heart screening. We are always very sensitive to how they receive the news. Every person who has been diagnosed with a heart condition will receive a personal phone call from our staff sharing the report from our team cardiologist. </p>

<p>Educating about the risks of heart disease and sudden cardiac arrest are equally important to our fund raising goals. Most of us know a friend or family member that has been effected by heart disease or sudden cardiac arrest. </p>

<p>   We all have our own individual challenges when it comes to our health and well-being.  Whether you are an avid natural health adventurer or just starting to see the potential benefits, there will always be a path in front of you. How you travel down that path is a decision, a choice. No matter where you are in your journey, the choice to live a vibrant life is only and always one step away.</p>
<p>   Our new motto: <u>Healing Bodies</u>- the physical aspect; <u>Opening Minds</u>- realizing what it means to be well and the possibilities for achieving that; <u>Uniting Hearts</u>- coming together to discover what really resonates among us all. What makes Nourishing Journey so unique is that we offer tri-level healing for body, mind and spirit all in one place. We work with our clients from a truly holistic approach - we care about the whole person.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming you into our beautiful new space this spring, together we can share greater love, joy, and peace!</p>

<p>   We have a small event room at our current location, but we want to offer more opportunities for our clients, their families and friends, and the local community at large to come in and learn  how to take better care of themselves.</p>
<p>   The new space will have two event rooms- one for intimate gatherings like meditation or intuitive readings, the other large enough for energy healing certification courses or training seminars. Some of the things we will host are yoga, meditation classes, health and wellness panel discussions with an integrative medical doctor, cooking classes, essential oils workshops and even leadership development courses.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>   Our current lounge area is really not ideal- it's upstairs next to the quiet treatment rooms. With the new organic café, we'll have a wide open space near the entrance with tables and chairs, including a workbench with laptop outlets. There aren’t that many choices in Howard County for good, healthy, wholesome food. We plan to offer another option for people to swing by on their way to work, or come and sit down for a cup of Bulletproof coffee or herbal tea, enjoy a light meal, and relax in good company.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We Want to Reward Your Generosity</h3>
<p>   We want to add real value to what our backers are investing in us, so we've put together exclusive service packages only available via this campaign. We want you to feel like you’re donating to a really great cause but also getting the opportunity to try some services that are new to you and see how they can benefit your overall wellness.</p>
<p>   The perks available to you through this crowdfund campaign were designed to offer some of the services you already love while introducing you to some services you've never tried. (Packages can also be purchased as gifts for someone else, but are not transferable to another name.)  Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><i><strong>The Journey 180 </strong>is the best value by far. With this six month membership perk, you'll enjoy 180 minutes of service every month - a 30 minute, a 60 minute and a 90 minute- plus get a bonus 15 minute service and your choice of a free Bulletproof coffee or Guilford Smoothie, and save $90 per month in the bargain</i>.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Circle of Wellness </strong>let you sample up to 100 minutes of services before you book a full treatment. Try a series of five different 20 minute services for yourself, or consider offering this to someone as a great gift</i>.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Guilford Experience</strong> is like a box of chocolates- you get your favorites along with some you may have wondered about. You get to experience six 60 minutes sessions, plus enjoy a bonus ionic footbath treatment.</i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Intended Impact</h3>
<p>   Our hope is that the new Nourishing Journey Wellness Center is going to have a powerful impact on the community and help as many people as we can. </p>
<p>   We’re all trying to find our way to being happy and healthy and joyous and connected at the heart. It’s so hard to do that sometimes. So the big vision Nourishing Journey is to support and grow a community with healing and wellness and spiritual connection; to bring people together and get back to loving each other again. We want you to feel a part of us; to feel welcome and at home.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>   Our risk is actually minimal- we have secured a bank loan for part of the expenses and we will be moving into the newer, larger and expansive space no matter what. The challenge comes in how available funds influence decisions regarding how the space is designed, constructed and utilized.  Not reaching our goal may, naturally, mean making compromises, therefore, the cafe might be delayed until much later in the year.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Our New Location!

   The purpose of this fundraiser is not to expand the business, but to extend our outreach into the community.  The core of our mission is to be a build an oasis of love and care. We envision a place that will feed you with the highest quality food, provide the best in alternative health care and awaken you to something greater within yourself.  Additionally, we plan to build an institute offering more courses which foster community, connectivity, health, leadership and principles for living a fulfilling life.
   In order to realize this goal, we are asking for your support! Building this level of community takes more than good intentions. It requires intentional investment from everyone who believes in the big-picture vision we’re holding. By making a contribution, you will not only receive a gift that will support your well-being but also  help us to create a place that will nourish, revive and support many people in feeling more empowered in their lives.
   We have an enormous vision of creating a welcoming place; a place where people want to belong, not just join; a place where no one is just a 'visitor'. The new Nourishing Journey Wellness Center and Cafe will center around you, a valued member of our community.
   The majority of the funds we raise will go towards the new organic café and the new education space. Some of the expenses associated with this level of expansion are

Architect and design blueprints 
Licensing and permits
Kitchen equipment
Training room equipment

Plumbing and fixtures

Building Contractor fees 
Demolition and Construction (flooring, walls, heating, etc.)

If you would simply like to support us, but don't necessarily want a perk, just click the dark pink ""Back It"" button above and choose the amount to give. Otherwise, keep reading!   
 If you are not able to donate at this time, but you're nevertheless excited to support our growth and expansion, please share this campaign with as many people as possible among your community, family, and friends.
And, of course, if you have any questions, please feel free to call us at 1-410-992-3001.
 
Wellness Is a Journey

   We all have our own individual challenges when it comes to our health and well-being.  Whether you are an avid natural health adventurer or just starting to see the potential benefits, there will always be a path in front of you. How you travel down that path is a decision, a choice. No matter where you are in your journey, the choice to live a vibrant life is only and always one step away.
   Our new motto: Healing Bodies- the physical aspect; Opening Minds- realizing what it means to be well and the possibilities for achieving that; Uniting Hearts- coming together to discover what really resonates among us all. What makes Nourishing Journey so unique is that we offer tri-level healing for body, mind and spirit all in one place. We work with our clients from a truly holistic approach - we care about the whole person.
We look forward to welcoming you into our beautiful new space this spring, together we can share greater love, joy, and peace!
 

Here's What We Are Changing


   We have a small event room at our current location, but we want to offer more opportunities for our clients, their families and friends, and the local community at large to come in and learn  how to take better care of themselves.
   The new space will have two event rooms- one for intimate gatherings like meditation or intuitive readings, the other large enough for energy healing certification courses or training seminars. Some of the things we will host are yoga, meditation classes, health and wellness panel discussions with an integrative medical doctor, cooking classes, essential oils workshops and even leadership development courses.
 

 
   Our current lounge area is really not ideal- it's upstairs next to the quiet treatment rooms. With the new organic café, we'll have a wide open space near the entrance with tables and chairs, including a workbench with laptop outlets. There aren’t that many choices in Howard County for good, healthy, wholesome food. We plan to offer another option for people to swing by on their way to work, or come and sit down for a cup of Bulletproof coffee or herbal tea, enjoy a light meal, and relax in good company.
 


  
We Want to Reward Your Generosity
   We want to add real value to what our backers are investing in us, so we've put together exclusive service packages only available via this campaign. We want you to feel like you’re donating to a really great cause but also getting the opportunity to try some services that are new to you and see how they can benefit your overall wellness.
   The perks available to you through this crowdfund campaign were designed to offer some of the services you already love while introducing you to some services you've never tried. (Packages can also be purchased as gifts for someone else, but are not transferable to another name.)  Here are a few examples:
The Journey 180 is the best value by far. With this six month membership perk, you'll enjoy 180 minutes of service every month - a 30 minute, a 60 minute and a 90 minute- plus get a bonus 15 minute service and your choice of a free Bulletproof coffee or Guilford Smoothie, and save $90 per month in the bargain.
The Circle of Wellness let you sample up to 100 minutes of services before you book a full treatment. Try a series of five different 20 minute services for yourself, or consider offering this to someone as a great gift.
The Guilford Experience is like a box of chocolates- you get your favorites along with some you may have wondered about. You get to experience six 60 minutes sessions, plus enjoy a bonus ionic footbath treatment.

 

Our Intended Impact
   Our hope is that the new Nourishing Journey Wellness Center is going to have a powerful impact on the community and help as many people as we can. 
   We’re all trying to find our way to being happy and healthy and joyous and connected at the heart. It’s so hard to do that sometimes. So the big vision Nourishing Journey is to support and grow a community with healing and wellness and spiritual connection; to bring people together and get back to loving each other again. We want you to feel a part of us; to feel welcome and at home.
The Risks and Challenges
   Our risk is actually minimal- we have secured a bank loan for part of the expenses and we will be moving into the newer, larger and expansive space no matter what. The challenge comes in how available funds influence decisions regarding how the space is designed, constructed and utilized.  Not reaching our goal may, naturally, mean making compromises, therefore, the cafe might be delayed until much later in the year.
 

 
Some Of Our Successes
   “The atmosphere was very peaceful. The practitioner was Very knowledgeable and eager to assist. Family owned business….very intimate (personal) setting. You definitely get the impression of they love what the do and put a lot of energy into the business. The offer a wide variety of services and seem very dedicated to wellness. I would highly recommend Nourishing Journey to anyone and will definitely go back.”

<p><strong>THE WHY</strong></p>
<p>Currently you can find AukaLife products in a few local juice bars, but we want to spread the LOVE throughout the COUNTRY! </p>

<li>My goal is to spread wellness EDUCATION and AWARENESS to local and global communities about the benefits of eating more plants &amp; seeds</li>
<li>I aim to show you the HEALING and DETOXIFYING benefits of natural plant life, so that you can overcome your biggest health obstacles, and live a happy life.</li>
<li>But most importantly BE HAPPY! And do what makes you and your body happy. If you need to eat a tub of ice cream because you had a sh*tty day - do it! If you haven't been to the gym in a month and too exhausted to fit it into your schedule, it's ok. I want to be an example for <u>young female entrepreneurs </u>everywhere that you can do anything you put your mind to, and it's ok if you stumble along the way. We have 1 life to live, so MAKE IT COUNT!</li>

<p><strong>CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>My 2 biggest challenges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum quantities required for bulk manufacturing are very high, especially with a single serving product, so the upfront costs are steep. This is why we need YOUR help to raise $ for pre-orders to get 10,000 units made.</li>
<li>The health supplements market is very saturated with tons of similar products, but I have spoken to <i>nutrition experts</i>, <i>personal trainers</i>, and <i>health doctors</i> who believe I have created a simple, effective product that my target market will really love.

<p>Since I was little, I have been always passionate about humanity, consciousness, evolution and spirituality. This passion led me to embrace this as a mission to help others to align with their true selves and discover their uniqueness. As and adult, I immersed myself in channeling activities and meditation practices and with the support of the messages I receive, I've been helping others to learn and discover amazing things within themselves that truly transform their lives!</p>
<h3>Why do I care so much about meditation?</h3>
<p><strong>Because when we learn to settle down our minds, we can connect with higher levels of energy and our higher selves, find peace, bright our lives and emanate love; and when we do that, we are helping the world. </strong></p>

<p>And while many of you reading this may have an interest in this topic, there are millions of individuals there who are desperately looking for solutions to find inner peace and change their lives and most of the times they can't find them because what they need is to remember who they really are and start getting answers from their inside.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people are desperately trying to understand life, but what they need to do is to connect with their inner power, and the best way is through meditation. </p>

<h3>That's why I Am asking for your help.</h3>
<p>With your donations, we will be developing a meditation app called I AM MEDITATION! where I will be uploading hundreds of different channeled guided meditations for people to work on all the different topics any human being can be concerned about.</p>
<p>Together we're going to raise $6,500 to develop the I AM MEDITATION app, which will be free to download and will contain a bunch of free guided meditations. It will also have a membership area for a very affordable price; this cost will be covering the monthly maintenance and equipment we need to keep uploading more material and covering the operation costs. </p>

<p>I have been practicing meditation for many years and also teaching to my clients this practice with amazing results and a positive transformation to their lives and the people who surround them.</p>
<p><strong>Creating this app we'll be helping millions of people to learn how to meditate in an easy and comfortable way.  Having access to this creation is like having a private meditation master with you every day, everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>This fundraiser isn't like many you've seen before.  There are two things that make this one different (and even more beneficial for you!)...<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. When you donate at certain levels you'll get access to my best creations, favorite private programs, and more.  </strong></p>
<p>Every penny we earn here will be used in the creation of the I AM MEDITATION app and to buy new equipment to continue creating high quality material.  You can get access to my most popular products and your money will benefit an incredible cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. You will be helping independent individuals, not the big companies.</strong></p>
<p>We are hiring young, enthusiastic and aware people who will love to have a chance to show their great abilities and move forward to help their families to succeed. </p>
<p>This means that you can get some of my best programs, knowing that you will be helping young people who need a chance and, at the same time, you will be helping millions of people to transform their lives.  Amazing, right? </p>

Nowadays, people are desperately trying to understand life, but what they need to do is to connect with their inner power, and the best way is through meditation. 

That's why I Am asking for your help.
With your donations, we will be developing a meditation app called I AM MEDITATION! where I will be uploading hundreds of different channeled guided meditations for people to work on all the different topics any human being can be concerned about.
Together we're going to raise $6,500 to develop the I AM MEDITATION app, which will be free to download and will contain a bunch of free guided meditations. It will also have a membership area for a very affordable price; this cost will be covering the monthly maintenance and equipment we need to keep uploading more material and covering the operation costs. 

I have been practicing meditation for many years and also teaching to my clients this practice with amazing results and a positive transformation to their lives and the people who surround them.
Creating this app we'll be helping millions of people to learn how to meditate in an easy and comfortable way.  Having access to this creation is like having a private meditation master with you every day, everywhere.
This fundraiser isn't like many you've seen before.  There are two things that make this one different (and even more beneficial for you!)... 
1. When you donate at certain levels you'll get access to my best creations, favorite private programs, and more.  
Every penny we earn here will be used in the creation of the I AM MEDITATION app and to buy new equipment to continue creating high quality material.  You can get access to my most popular products and your money will benefit an incredible cause.
2. You will be helping independent individuals, not the big companies.
We are hiring young, enthusiastic and aware people who will love to have a chance to show their great abilities and move forward to help their families to succeed. 
This means that you can get some of my best programs, knowing that you will be helping young people who need a chance and, at the same time, you will be helping millions of people to transform their lives.  Amazing, right? 

Ready to support? Take a look at the different donation levels on the right-hand side of this page. Each level is stacked, so if you donate $50, for example, you'll also get the prizes for the $25 and $10 levels, too. The more you donate, the more you get.
Have questions about this fundraiser or any of the prizes? Email us at info@carmenvasquez.net and we'll respond ASAP.
Please note: We won't be able to offer refunds for any contribution made here, as your payment will be considered a donation and will go directly to the creation of the I AM MEDITATION app. Thank you so much for supporting this incredible project!
THERE IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL POWER THAT LIES WITHIN ALL OF US; GO ON A MAGICAL JOURNEY TO DISCOVER AND AWAKE YOUR OWN INNER POWER THROUGH MEDITATION!
