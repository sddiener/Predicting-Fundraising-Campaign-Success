<h3><strong>The End Is the Beginning /<br/>The Beginning Is the End</strong></h3>
<p>That's the theme for the fifth and perhaps final volume in the <i>Chiral Mad </i>series by Written Backwards. This anthology will be edited by Michael Bailey, recipient of the Benjamin Franklin Award, Bram Stoker Award, and a Shirley Jackson Award nominee. Is this the beginning of the end for Written Backwards, or will this be the end to a new beginning? You get to help decide. And while we're at it, we are going to raise some serious funds for <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong>, and represent the underrepresented in the literary world. It's time to listen.</p>
<p>Previous Written Backwards anthologies have always included emerging talent alongside known names in the industry, spanning short fiction, long fiction, graphic adaptations, poetry, and artwork, and ranging from dark science-fiction and fantasy to horror; all things speculative. For more information on previous anthologies, visit <a href=""https://blog.nettirw.com/anthologies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nettirw.com</a> (but keep scrolling for now).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591229363/ue589m0thaf6ny1hs53e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For this latest chiral dance, the focus is <strong>diversity</strong>. Past anthologies have slowly improved over the years in this area, with effort always made to find new voices in the literary world, but that has not been enough. We need to hit the world harder. We need to better represent the underrepresented. We need to listen to those voices screaming out. For this fifth act in the series, we are reaching out to places like Botswana, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, Japan; basically, as far out as we can reach, all over the world, with an emphasis on highlighting underrepresented demographics.</p>
<p>And this time around Written Backwards is asking for your help, both monetarily and to shine light upon new and emerging writers and artists who need to be heard at this important time, those who are otherwise not-so-relatively-known but <i>should</i> be. To do that, we are going back to the roots of what originally launched this small press<i> </i>off the ground: <strong>charity</strong>.</p>
<p>The first <i>Chiral Mad</i> focused on bringing awareness to Down syndrome and raised over $6,000 for various charities, with all work donated, and with all proceeds going to organizations such as the <a href=""http://downsyndromeinfo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Down Syndrome Information Alliance (DSIA)</a>. <i>Chiral Mad 2 </i>paid professional rates to contributors, and profit then went to charity, but didn't raise nearly as much for the greater good. And both <i>Chiral Mad 3</i> and <i>Chiral Mad 4: An Anthology of Collaborations</i> were not designed to support charity. This time around, <i>Chiral Mad 5</i> will pay professional rates to contributors of underrepresented demographics, with all proceeds (everything but the cost to initially create the book) going to <strong><a href=""https://blacklivesmatter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Lives Matter</a></strong>, indefinitely. </p>
<p>If you have a problem with that, there's an X at the top right of your screen you can click, or simply throw your phone across the room if that's what you're using to read this.</p>
<p>Here's what we are hoping to accomplish with this not-for-profit project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support and bring awareness to the Black Lives Matter movement</li>
<li>Raise as much money as humanly possible for that cause </li>
<li>Create an incredibly diverse anthology of fiction, poetry, and artwork</li>
<li>Bring underrepresented talent to the limelight</li>
<li>Pay professional rates to that talent</li>
<li>Not make money off this anthology whatsoever (other than for the charity)</li>
<li>Promote change inside and out of the literary world</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The goal is to keep overall cost minimal. More well-known writers invited to the anthology (there are some big names already attached) will be asked to forego payment to keep cost down. Contributors of underrepresented demographics, however, will be offered professional payment (6 cents per word for fiction, a dollar per line for poetry), but may donate their work in lieu of payment if they so choose.</p>
<p>Also, all Written Backwards titles purchased as add-ons during this campaign (60 days) will benefit this campaign to help raise money for the cause, with no profit made by the editor or publisher whosoever.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><i>Chiral Mad 5</i> will be made available worldwide in a deluxe signed &amp; numbered hardcover (with all the bells and whistles, and signed by the editor), trade hardcover, trade paperback, and eBook. So, what exactly is needed to make that happen?</p>
<p>Michael Bailey will be designing the cover and interior files and donating his time, and the anthology will be made available for purchase online around the world, with printing services provided by high-quality print-on-demand (except for the deluxe hardcover). This will keep cost down. A little less than $5,000 is needed to get this project off the ground, <i>initially</i>, which is the first goal (less depending on work that is donated. Here's how that looks:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,000 for fiction / poetry, to pay $0.06 per word for fiction, $1 per line for poetry to contributors from underrepresented demographics. <strong>$0.08 per word if campaign reaches 150% funding.</strong>
</li>
<li>$1,000+ to cover printing costs (depending on number of books ordered)</li>
<li>$295 for ISBNs, barcode creation, etc.</li>
<li>$250 for viral marketing / promotion</li>
<li>$250+ for Indiegogo's 5% cut (for that initial $5K amount)</li>
<li>$150 for distribution</li>
<li>That's about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>No profit will be made by the editor or the publisher, whatsoever.</p>
<p>This is a charity anthology, after all, so during this campaign the prices might seem a little steeper than what one might expect at Amazon or elsewhere for an anthology. Why? To help make sure this important project happens. To raise the initial amount donated to <a href=""https://blacklivesmatter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Lives Matter</a> as quickly as possible so they have it sooner rather than later. So the amount raised can grow until a large chunk of money can likewise go to writers of underrepresented demographics for making their voices heard.</p>
<p>Shipping &amp; handling will be added to the end of all physical orders so as much money as possible can go to the charity. Funds not spent on shipping &amp; handling or otherwise will go toward the greater good.<br/><br/>Post-campaign, all profit made from this anthology, <strong>indefinitely</strong>, will support <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong>, as well as any and all funds not used for the production of the book. *Please note that as more hardcovers are ordered (especially signed &amp; numbered), the $1,000 amount above will increase proportionally. And post-campaign, transparency will be key.<br/> </p>

</div><div>

</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The initial amount to be raised means this is all or nothing (at least at the beginning), but we'll get past that rather quickly with your help.</p>
<p>Future goal unlocks will be announced after hitting the initial fund goal.<br/> </p>
</div><div>

After the campaign ends, it will still run for a few months (for additional pre-orders) so additional funds can be collected to hopefully make this happen. So, if you buy a book through this campaign, you are not only helping raise funds for Black Lives Matter (where all profit from this book will go), you are also helping writers receive professional payment for their work from not only the Horror Writers Association (HWA), but also the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA).

The End Is the Beginning /The Beginning Is the End
That's the theme for the fifth and perhaps final volume in the Chiral Mad series by Written Backwards. This anthology will be edited by Michael Bailey, recipient of the Benjamin Franklin Award, Bram Stoker Award, and a Shirley Jackson Award nominee. Is this the beginning of the end for Written Backwards, or will this be the end to a new beginning? You get to help decide. And while we're at it, we are going to raise some serious funds for Black Lives Matter, and represent the underrepresented in the literary world. It's time to listen.
Previous Written Backwards anthologies have always included emerging talent alongside known names in the industry, spanning short fiction, long fiction, graphic adaptations, poetry, and artwork, and ranging from dark science-fiction and fantasy to horror; all things speculative. For more information on previous anthologies, visit nettirw.com (but keep scrolling for now).

For this latest chiral dance, the focus is diversity. Past anthologies have slowly improved over the years in this area, with effort always made to find new voices in the literary world, but that has not been enough. We need to hit the world harder. We need to better represent the underrepresented. We need to listen to those voices screaming out. For this fifth act in the series, we are reaching out to places like Botswana, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, Japan; basically, as far out as we can reach, all over the world, with an emphasis on highlighting underrepresented demographics.
And this time around Written Backwards is asking for your help, both monetarily and to shine light upon new and emerging writers and artists who need to be heard at this important time, those who are otherwise not-so-relatively-known but should be. To do that, we are going back to the roots of what originally launched this small press off the ground: charity.
The first Chiral Mad focused on bringing awareness to Down syndrome and raised over $6,000 for various charities, with all work donated, and with all proceeds going to organizations such as the Down Syndrome Information Alliance (DSIA). Chiral Mad 2 paid professional rates to contributors, and profit then went to charity, but didn't raise nearly as much for the greater good. And both Chiral Mad 3 and Chiral Mad 4: An Anthology of Collaborations were not designed to support charity. This time around, Chiral Mad 5 will pay professional rates to contributors of underrepresented demographics, with all proceeds (everything but the cost to initially create the book) going to Black Lives Matter, indefinitely. 
If you have a problem with that, there's an X at the top right of your screen you can click, or simply throw your phone across the room if that's what you're using to read this.
Here's what we are hoping to accomplish with this not-for-profit project:

Support and bring awareness to the Black Lives Matter movement
Raise as much money as humanly possible for that cause 
Create an incredibly diverse anthology of fiction, poetry, and artwork
Bring underrepresented talent to the limelight
Pay professional rates to that talent
Not make money off this anthology whatsoever (other than for the charity)
Promote change inside and out of the literary world


The goal is to keep overall cost minimal. More well-known writers invited to the anthology (there are some big names already attached) will be asked to forego payment to keep cost down. Contributors of underrepresented demographics, however, will be offered professional payment (6 cents per word for fiction, a dollar per line for poetry), but may donate their work in lieu of payment if they so choose.
Also, all Written Backwards titles purchased as add-ons during this campaign (60 days) will benefit this campaign to help raise money for the cause, with no profit made by the editor or publisher whosoever. 
What We Need & What You Get
Chiral Mad 5 will be made available worldwide in a deluxe signed & numbered hardcover (with all the bells and whistles, and signed by the editor), trade hardcover, trade paperback, and eBook. So, what exactly is needed to make that happen?
Michael Bailey will be designing the cover and interior files and donating his time, and the anthology will be made available for purchase online around the world, with printing services provided by high-quality print-on-demand (except for the deluxe hardcover). This will keep cost down. A little less than $5,000 is needed to get this project off the ground, initially, which is the first goal (less depending on work that is donated. Here's how that looks:

$3,000 for fiction / poetry, to pay $0.06 per word for fiction, $1 per line for poetry to contributors from underrepresented demographics. $0.08 per word if campaign reaches 150% funding.

$1,000+ to cover printing costs (depending on number of books ordered)
$295 for ISBNs, barcode creation, etc.
$250 for viral marketing / promotion
$250+ for Indiegogo's 5% cut (for that initial $5K amount)
$150 for distribution
That's about it.

No profit will be made by the editor or the publisher, whatsoever.
This is a charity anthology, after all, so during this campaign the prices might seem a little steeper than what one might expect at Amazon or elsewhere for an anthology. Why? To help make sure this important project happens. To raise the initial amount donated to Black Lives Matter as quickly as possible so they have it sooner rather than later. So the amount raised can grow until a large chunk of money can likewise go to writers of underrepresented demographics for making their voices heard.
Shipping & handling will be added to the end of all physical orders so as much money as possible can go to the charity. Funds not spent on shipping & handling or otherwise will go toward the greater good.Post-campaign, all profit made from this anthology, indefinitely, will support Black Lives Matter, as well as any and all funds not used for the production of the book. *Please note that as more hardcovers are ordered (especially signed & numbered), the $1,000 amount above will increase proportionally. And post-campaign, transparency will be key.

Black lives matter. Plain and simple. We need to fix this world, and we can help do that by raising awareness, raising money, and through expression in fiction, poetry, and artwork. And, of course, by listening. 

Risks & Challenges
The initial amount to be raised means this is all or nothing (at least at the beginning), but we'll get past that rather quickly with your help.
Future goal unlocks will be announced after hitting the initial fund goal.

<h3>
<br/>Thank you for the amazing support I have received!</h3>
<p>The book is now published and out on Amazon if you want to purchase.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>My name is Anne Whitehouse, I'm a PhD scientist in metallurgy and a former university lecturer in Engineering, turned Female Power Alchemist! I experienced first hand just how much women are still held back, limited and undermined in the world, despite our rights and capabilities. </p>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you felt invisible, or worse were relegated to someone to serve the tea in a room where you are actually ""The Expert""?</p>
<p>Did you believe that if you got an education and worked hard, that you could fulfil your potential? But when you get there you find yourself blocked, and undermined by low confidence, stress, exhaustion, imposter syndrome and glass ceilings?</p>
<p>You're not alone!  Many women experience this.  Up until now, there was nothing we could do about it because we didn't understand what was happening.  We thought that was just the way things were. We have been struggling against an unknown beast, without the tools to change things!</p>
<p>This struggle cost me my scientific career, and I've seen the same pattern blocking many other brilliant women from achieving what they want in life.  </p>
<p>It became my life's mission solve this problem for us all, and I applied my scientific approach to the hidden world of the subconscious to analyse the problem.</p>
<p>What I discovered is a game-changer!</p>
<p>It's taken me 20 years to solve the puzzle and find the solution, and I'm now ready to share my ground-breaking discoveries with you.  I believe this is the key women have been waiting for - the key we need to finally get a level playing field.</p>
<p>This is new, it's pioneering and yes it's controversial in places! But if you're a woman who wants to truly embrace her power, and who has felt blocked and undermined, then you need this knowledge.</p>
<p>My vision:  to enable every woman to shine, achieve and create whatever she wants in life free of restraints and sabotage.</p>
<p>Your support will help me get this knowledge out into the world, where all women can benefit. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Big Is The Problem Women Face?</h3>
<p>Did you realise that women underestimate their abilities 30% with respect to men with the same qualifications?  There are many studies that show women lack confidence in promoting themselves, hold back, and struggle to speak up when they wish they could. </p>
<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg.  Hidden glass ceilings, subconscious limits and ancestral conditioning keep us restrained and prevent us from letting ourselves shine and outshine those around us. This isn't just the case in male-dominated professions, women struggle with these things everywhere.</p>
<p>The hidden beast pulls us back, but consciously we push ourselves to move forward and achieve. The result is enormous internal conflict which in turn creates stress, anxiety, Imposter Syndrome, feelings of not being good enough, burnout, destructive perfectionism and exhaustion.   Eventually something has to break. It stops us from being everything of which we are capable, and prevents the world from getting the benefit of everything we have to offer. </p>
<p>The more we strive to succeed, the bigger the conflict, and the worse it gets. I've lost count of the number of talented women I've helped over the last two decades whose success, happiness and wellbeing have been destroyed by these patterns.  </p>
<p>It's time this changed, once and for all.</p>
<p>However, I need help to fully realise this vision and that's why I'm asking for your support.</p>

<h3>Foreword by Rachel Elnaugh<br/>(BBCTV's Dragons' Den)</h3>
<p><i>""MAGICAL and UTTERLY COMPELLING.  If you are a woman who has ever felt exhausted or thwarted, despite your best efforts to succeed, finally we have the stunning explanation why.  I recognised myself (as well as many of my professional Sisters) amongst the 5 typical female archetypes us 'power' women are subconsciously drawn into - none of which are truly empowering - and finally understood how &amp; why my life had always felt like such a battle. In this wonderfully liberating book, Anne also offers a series of beautiful and powerfully transformative practical tools to assist us in our collective journey towards the 'Evolved Feminine'.</i>  </p>
<p><i>I'd like to explain why I have described this book as MAGICAL and UTTERLY COMPELLING.</i></p>
<p><i>But first, some context.  </i></p>
<p><i>I'd agreed to review the draft and write a testimonial, provided a hard copy was sent to me, and then forgot all about it - coming back from holiday to a card asking me to collect a 'to be signed for' delivery at the sorting office - which I did, en route to the doctor, to be tested for a persistent infection.  </i></p>
<p><i>I then headed up to the local Church and sat in stillness for a while, offering up a few silent prayers.  'Why did it feel like my life was in the Doldrums?' 'Where along the way had I so spectacularly lost my Mojo?' 'How come the only tasks I felt able to complete competently and without anxiety these days were housework and cooking?' </i></p>
<p><i>'Please send me some help and guidance'.</i></p>
<p><i>The answer was sitting right there - in the unopened envelope, on the pew next to me.</i></p>
<p><i>Once I started reading the manuscript later that day I could not stop until I had reached the end.  This book perfectly explained 'The Beast' I had been up against my entire life - without me even having conscious awareness of it!</i></p>
<p><i>And I am someone who has truly gone deep with all sorts of transformational processes... exploring every aspect of childhood trauma, delving into the various Shadow aspects of myself, even going on spiritual pilgrimages to Peru to experience plant medicine with the shamans.  </i></p>
<p><i>I knew there was SOMETHING I had to be missing, but I didn't know what.</i></p>
<p><i>My life as a professional woman has always been in the world of money and business - working my way up in accountancy, and then creating my own company Red Letter Days at the age of 24, building it up into an award winning £multi-million turnover market-leading brand, only to lose it 14 years later to a series of calamities, and thanks to my TV fame as one of the 'Dragons' on the first two series of BBCTV's acclaimed business show 'Dragons' Den', being pretty much annihilated by the media.</i></p>
<p><i>Despite many and varied attempts to get my life back on track, everything seemed to turn to dust - especially as I started to unplug from the masculine warrior energy which had been driving me for so many years (I grew up with 4 brothers, so had a training in battle).  </i></p>
<p><i>I also trained in trauma healing skills, and it dawned on me just how many years I had been living in full 'predator alert', in a soup of adrenaline.</i></p>
<p><i>It seems to me that we are currently at a crucial turning point, where it is vital that women root out every last piece of old patriarchal programming - the deeply ingrained legacy of so many years of male dominance.</i></p>
<p><i>Yet we will not achieve that unless we realise just how radically our power has been undermined.</i></p>
<p><i>This book explains 'The Beast' we are up against - and how we can transmute and transcend it.</i></p>
<p><i>This is precious, essential reading for every woman striving to be successful in a man's world - and I am so grateful for the many hours of meticulous, scientific research Anne has put in to create it.</i></p>
<p><i>I know that it will inspire you as much as it did me.""</i></p>

<h3>How Did This Book Come About?</h3>
<p>After a glowing 8 years at Cambridge I started my career as a university lecturer in 1996 with high hopes, but everything began to fall apart almost immediately. I could do my job just fine, but something was undermining me from inside. I tried every conventional technique available to boost my confidence, release stress and help me cope in my work environment. Nothing worked.  I couldn't understand why I felt so vulnerable and inadequate when I was perfectly qualified, capable and the academic equal of all my colleagues.  I ended up with chronic fatigue, anxiety and panic attacks, and I lost the scientific career I'd worked so hard for.  </p>
<p>Basically, it was a spectacular burnout!</p>
<p>After conventional approaches totally failed to help me, I was left with no alternative but to find the  solution myself; the reason why I had been unable to thrive in a career for which I was eminently qualified and the way back to wellbeing.  I trained in many healing modalities specialising in the subconscious mind and dived into the deep hidden operating system that defines our reactions. Over the next few years, I worked on myself, and helped many other women who had all gone through their own version of this story, in many walks of life.  Gradually all the pieces began to come together, and by 2012 I could see exactly why we were all being sabotaged.</p>
<p>Knowing the problem is one thing.  Finding an actual solution is something else entirely!</p>
<p>My existing training could not make the changes I now knew were needed, so I began to experiment, on myself and on a group of willing clients.  I developed an entirely new modality that could change the power dynamic in minds and bodies, transforming how it feels when we interact with the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Missing Power Foundation</h3>
<p>Here's the truth, there is nothing wrong with us at all!  We simply do not have the <strong><i>power foundation</i></strong>  that a man automatically inherits from history. The subtle messages of the past still prevail on many levels and these undermine every women who strives to achieve her full potential in life.  This triggers us to lose our power - not beliefs in power, but an actual energetic effect. This all creates a cascade reaction which locks us in a perpetual fight or flight response.</p>
<p>We fight it, we push forwards, we compensate and we do achieve, but the rug is still pulled out from under us; there is a heavy cost and we are paying it every day.</p>
<p>""Pull Back Your Power"" brings you the results of my discoveries, in a way you can use by yourself, immediately.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565890792/uexzvwqvckbkhcndpu4m.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's In The Book?</h3>
<p>The book is designed in two sections. If you follow it through, and do the exercises, you will begin to feel different.  This isn't just a theory book, you will be healing and empowering yourself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Part 1 - The Real Beast You're Up Against</strong></i></p>
<p>The first part is a deep dive in to the hidden energies of our world.  You will finally understand the hidden beast that undermines women every day. You can never fully embrace your power until you understand just how much women have been sabotaged by the legacy of male power, and how this has manifested in your own life.  </p>
<p>You'll be appalled at how disempowered we still are, despite our 'equality'.</p>
<p>You'll also discover your Female Power Archetype which will explain to you exactly how your life experiences have disempowered you up until now, and how you can use this to activate your unique gifts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Part 2 - The Solution</strong></i></p>
<p>The second part is your process to free yourself from that straitjacket. I take you through each of the six keys of feminine empowerment, each carefully designed to undo the restrictions of the past, and bring in the power foundation we need to activate our true female power (not the suppressed version the patriarchal world has forced on us) and change the balance of power in our lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Online Audio Bonuses For Readers</h3>
<p>I'll be creating a series of powerful audio guided meditations and clearings, available for readers to access online.  This is something I have been doing for many years, and am highly experienced with. Each recording is carefully crafted to support and enhance each step of my empowerment system.</p>
<p>Not only will this guide readers through the process, enabling them to learn the techniques as if I were there with them, but the effects will also be magnified with my unique energetic techniques.</p>
<p>Your support of my campaign will provide the means to create this next level of benefits for readers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Is This Different?</h3>
<p>Most empowerment techniques focus on conscious understanding, releasing emotions and changing limiting beliefs.  All these things are of benefit, and I used them for years.  However, if we want to stop the struggle, and be truly free, the only way is to change the power foundation; the underlying hidden dynamic which undermines us and keeps our minds and bodies locked into a disempowering fear state.  Before now, we did not have the tools to change this, but I have developed the understanding and techniques needed to do this.  I believe this is new and unique.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Meet Grace!</h3>
<p>As we go through the book, you'll come to know Grace, my fairytale character, as she struggles to reach the Palace of Success.  (It's Grace you see in my illustrations.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565888229/stfkcaq9a96rjqjhmugc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Why is she there in a 'serious' book you may ask?  Well, she represents our journey from the patriarchal past full of limitations and unfairness, to the point where we activate our true female power.  </p>
<p>She starts off obeying all the rules, but then finally she says 'enough is enough' and breaks free from the laws of the Status Quo.  She doesn't need rescuing, and she's not going to conform any longer and she's going to do things her way. </p>
<p>I have enjoyed creating Grace's story enormously and I hope you will like her as much as I do! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What Do I need?</h3>
<p>I believe passionately in this book, and I feel very strongly that it is the perfect time for a book like this to be published. I am so determined to see my dream become a reality that I am footing a lot of the cost myself. However, publishing a book costs a great deal of money, so any support you can give me is most welcome. </p>
<p>I would like to offer you the chance to invest in the book and my mission right from the start.</p>
<p>The target is to raise £15,000 which would cover the publishing costs, and help me launch the book properly.  </p>
<p>If you'd like to help me make my dream a reality I'd very much appreciate your pledge today.  All the funds raised will go towards the publishing and editing costs, book promotion, and printing copies. </p>
<p>This is a mission to get this knowledge to the women who need it;  the more I can raise the more women I can help. I can't do it alone!</p>

The Vision
My name is Anne Whitehouse, I'm a PhD scientist in metallurgy and a former university lecturer in Engineering, turned Female Power Alchemist! I experienced first hand just how much women are still held back, limited and undermined in the world, despite our rights and capabilities. 
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt invisible, or worse were relegated to someone to serve the tea in a room where you are actually ""The Expert""?
Did you believe that if you got an education and worked hard, that you could fulfil your potential? But when you get there you find yourself blocked, and undermined by low confidence, stress, exhaustion, imposter syndrome and glass ceilings?
You're not alone!  Many women experience this.  Up until now, there was nothing we could do about it because we didn't understand what was happening.  We thought that was just the way things were. We have been struggling against an unknown beast, without the tools to change things!
This struggle cost me my scientific career, and I've seen the same pattern blocking many other brilliant women from achieving what they want in life.  
It became my life's mission solve this problem for us all, and I applied my scientific approach to the hidden world of the subconscious to analyse the problem.
What I discovered is a game-changer!
It's taken me 20 years to solve the puzzle and find the solution, and I'm now ready to share my ground-breaking discoveries with you.  I believe this is the key women have been waiting for - the key we need to finally get a level playing field.
This is new, it's pioneering and yes it's controversial in places! But if you're a woman who wants to truly embrace her power, and who has felt blocked and undermined, then you need this knowledge.
My vision:  to enable every woman to shine, achieve and create whatever she wants in life free of restraints and sabotage.
Your support will help me get this knowledge out into the world, where all women can benefit. 
 
How Big Is The Problem Women Face?
Did you realise that women underestimate their abilities 30% with respect to men with the same qualifications?  There are many studies that show women lack confidence in promoting themselves, hold back, and struggle to speak up when they wish they could. 
This is only the tip of the iceberg.  Hidden glass ceilings, subconscious limits and ancestral conditioning keep us restrained and prevent us from letting ourselves shine and outshine those around us. This isn't just the case in male-dominated professions, women struggle with these things everywhere.
The hidden beast pulls us back, but consciously we push ourselves to move forward and achieve. The result is enormous internal conflict which in turn creates stress, anxiety, Imposter Syndrome, feelings of not being good enough, burnout, destructive perfectionism and exhaustion.   Eventually something has to break. It stops us from being everything of which we are capable, and prevents the world from getting the benefit of everything we have to offer. 
The more we strive to succeed, the bigger the conflict, and the worse it gets. I've lost count of the number of talented women I've helped over the last two decades whose success, happiness and wellbeing have been destroyed by these patterns.  
It's time this changed, once and for all.
However, I need help to fully realise this vision and that's why I'm asking for your support.
 

Foreword by Rachel Elnaugh(BBCTV's Dragons' Den)
""MAGICAL and UTTERLY COMPELLING.  If you are a woman who has ever felt exhausted or thwarted, despite your best efforts to succeed, finally we have the stunning explanation why.  I recognised myself (as well as many of my professional Sisters) amongst the 5 typical female archetypes us 'power' women are subconsciously drawn into - none of which are truly empowering - and finally understood how & why my life had always felt like such a battle. In this wonderfully liberating book, Anne also offers a series of beautiful and powerfully transformative practical tools to assist us in our collective journey towards the 'Evolved Feminine'.  
I'd like to explain why I have described this book as MAGICAL and UTTERLY COMPELLING.
But first, some context.  
I'd agreed to review the draft and write a testimonial, provided a hard copy was sent to me, and then forgot all about it - coming back from holiday to a card asking me to collect a 'to be signed for' delivery at the sorting office - which I did, en route to the doctor, to be tested for a persistent infection.  
I then headed up to the local Church and sat in stillness for a while, offering up a few silent prayers.  'Why did it feel like my life was in the Doldrums?' 'Where along the way had I so spectacularly lost my Mojo?' 'How come the only tasks I felt able to complete competently and without anxiety these days were housework and cooking?' 
'Please send me some help and guidance'.
The answer was sitting right there - in the unopened envelope, on the pew next to me.
Once I started reading the manuscript later that day I could not stop until I had reached the end.  This book perfectly explained 'The Beast' I had been up against my entire life - without me even having conscious awareness of it!
And I am someone who has truly gone deep with all sorts of transformational processes... exploring every aspect of childhood trauma, delving into the various Shadow aspects of myself, even going on spiritual pilgrimages to Peru to experience plant medicine with the shamans.  
I knew there was SOMETHING I had to be missing, but I didn't know what.
My life as a professional woman has always been in the world of money and business - working my way up in accountancy, and then creating my own company Red Letter Days at the age of 24, building it up into an award winning £multi-million turnover market-leading brand, only to lose it 14 years later to a series of calamities, and thanks to my TV fame as one of the 'Dragons' on the first two series of BBCTV's acclaimed business show 'Dragons' Den', being pretty much annihilated by the media.
Despite many and varied attempts to get my life back on track, everything seemed to turn to dust - especially as I started to unplug from the masculine warrior energy which had been driving me for so many years (I grew up with 4 brothers, so had a training in battle).  
I also trained in trauma healing skills, and it dawned on me just how many years I had been living in full 'predator alert', in a soup of adrenaline.
It seems to me that we are currently at a crucial turning point, where it is vital that women root out every last piece of old patriarchal programming - the deeply ingrained legacy of so many years of male dominance.
Yet we will not achieve that unless we realise just how radically our power has been undermined.
This book explains 'The Beast' we are up against - and how we can transmute and transcend it.
This is precious, essential reading for every woman striving to be successful in a man's world - and I am so grateful for the many hours of meticulous, scientific research Anne has put in to create it.
I know that it will inspire you as much as it did me.""

How Did This Book Come About?
After a glowing 8 years at Cambridge I started my career as a university lecturer in 1996 with high hopes, but everything began to fall apart almost immediately. I could do my job just fine, but something was undermining me from inside. I tried every conventional technique available to boost my confidence, release stress and help me cope in my work environment. Nothing worked.  I couldn't understand why I felt so vulnerable and inadequate when I was perfectly qualified, capable and the academic equal of all my colleagues.  I ended up with chronic fatigue, anxiety and panic attacks, and I lost the scientific career I'd worked so hard for.  
Basically, it was a spectacular burnout!
After conventional approaches totally failed to help me, I was left with no alternative but to find the  solution myself; the reason why I had been unable to thrive in a career for which I was eminently qualified and the way back to wellbeing.  I trained in many healing modalities specialising in the subconscious mind and dived into the deep hidden operating system that defines our reactions. Over the next few years, I worked on myself, and helped many other women who had all gone through their own version of this story, in many walks of life.  Gradually all the pieces began to come together, and by 2012 I could see exactly why we were all being sabotaged.
Knowing the problem is one thing.  Finding an actual solution is something else entirely!
My existing training could not make the changes I now knew were needed, so I began to experiment, on myself and on a group of willing clients.  I developed an entirely new modality that could change the power dynamic in minds and bodies, transforming how it feels when we interact with the world. 
 
Our Missing Power Foundation
Here's the truth, there is nothing wrong with us at all!  We simply do not have the power foundation  that a man automatically inherits from history. The subtle messages of the past still prevail on many levels and these undermine every women who strives to achieve her full potential in life.  This triggers us to lose our power - not beliefs in power, but an actual energetic effect. This all creates a cascade reaction which locks us in a perpetual fight or flight response.
We fight it, we push forwards, we compensate and we do achieve, but the rug is still pulled out from under us; there is a heavy cost and we are paying it every day.
""Pull Back Your Power"" brings you the results of my discoveries, in a way you can use by yourself, immediately.

 
 
What's In The Book?
The book is designed in two sections. If you follow it through, and do the exercises, you will begin to feel different.  This isn't just a theory book, you will be healing and empowering yourself.
Part 1 - The Real Beast You're Up Against
The first part is a deep dive in to the hidden energies of our world.  You will finally understand the hidden beast that undermines women every day. You can never fully embrace your power until you understand just how much women have been sabotaged by the legacy of male power, and how this has manifested in your own life.  
You'll be appalled at how disempowered we still are, despite our 'equality'.
You'll also discover your Female Power Archetype which will explain to you exactly how your life experiences have disempowered you up until now, and how you can use this to activate your unique gifts.
 
Part 2 - The Solution
The second part is your process to free yourself from that straitjacket. I take you through each of the six keys of feminine empowerment, each carefully designed to undo the restrictions of the past, and bring in the power foundation we need to activate our true female power (not the suppressed version the patriarchal world has forced on us) and change the balance of power in our lives.
 
Online Audio Bonuses For Readers
I'll be creating a series of powerful audio guided meditations and clearings, available for readers to access online.  This is something I have been doing for many years, and am highly experienced with. Each recording is carefully crafted to support and enhance each step of my empowerment system.
Not only will this guide readers through the process, enabling them to learn the techniques as if I were there with them, but the effects will also be magnified with my unique energetic techniques.
Your support of my campaign will provide the means to create this next level of benefits for readers.
 
How Is This Different?
Most empowerment techniques focus on conscious understanding, releasing emotions and changing limiting beliefs.  All these things are of benefit, and I used them for years.  However, if we want to stop the struggle, and be truly free, the only way is to change the power foundation; the underlying hidden dynamic which undermines us and keeps our minds and bodies locked into a disempowering fear state.  Before now, we did not have the tools to change this, but I have developed the understanding and techniques needed to do this.  I believe this is new and unique.
 
Meet Grace!
As we go through the book, you'll come to know Grace, my fairytale character, as she struggles to reach the Palace of Success.  (It's Grace you see in my illustrations.)

Why is she there in a 'serious' book you may ask?  Well, she represents our journey from the patriarchal past full of limitations and unfairness, to the point where we activate our true female power.  
She starts off obeying all the rules, but then finally she says 'enough is enough' and breaks free from the laws of the Status Quo.  She doesn't need rescuing, and she's not going to conform any longer and she's going to do things her way. 
I have enjoyed creating Grace's story enormously and I hope you will like her as much as I do! 
 
What Do I need?
I believe passionately in this book, and I feel very strongly that it is the perfect time for a book like this to be published. I am so determined to see my dream become a reality that I am footing a lot of the cost myself. However, publishing a book costs a great deal of money, so any support you can give me is most welcome. 
I would like to offer you the chance to invest in the book and my mission right from the start.
The target is to raise £15,000 which would cover the publishing costs, and help me launch the book properly.  
If you'd like to help me make my dream a reality I'd very much appreciate your pledge today.  All the funds raised will go towards the publishing and editing costs, book promotion, and printing copies. 
This is a mission to get this knowledge to the women who need it;  the more I can raise the more women I can help. I can't do it alone!

<h3><strong>I'm Going On A Trip</strong></h3>
<p>Last year, I took a trip to Europe for the first time, taking a whole month and visiting London, Paris, Berlin, and Prague. While on that trip, I <a href=""http://www.mikeschramm.com/general/schramm-in-europe-roundup-20120511"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">posted on my blog daily</a>, and both the trip and the experience of writing about it every day were very meaningful for me. It helped me a lot, to organize my thoughts and take in everything that was happening around me. And a lot of people who read those posts said they really enjoyed them. I'm a good writer, and a lot of people told me that it felt like they were off on the trip with me, seeing the world over there through my eyes.</p>
<p>This year, I've been invited to two events a little closer to home, coming up between the dates of June 20, 2013 and July 8. On June 22, my cousin is getting married in Denver, Colorado -- she and her girlfriend have been together for a long time, and they're very happy that as of this year, they can finally officially tie the knot. And then, on July 5, I've made plans to visit the great (and Kickstarter-backed!) <a href=""http://nerdtacular.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nerdtacular</a>, an annual celebration of nerds and all of the things that they love.</p>
<p>I was planning to go online and buy two plane tickets for these trips, but then I remembered my European trip and how much fun it was to explore the world a little bit, and then share what I saw with everyone else online. How great would it be, I thought, if I drove 2,000 miles around the US instead, up from LA through the desert and across the Rockies to Colorado for my cousin's wedding, and then north to Nerdtacular and Salt Lake City and all of my friends there before heading back home?</p>
<p>So that's what I've decided to do.</p>
<h3><strong>... And I'm Crowdfunding It</strong></h3>
<p>I've also been thinking lately about Kickstarter and Indiegogo and crowdfunding, and how it works (something <a href=""http://www.mikeschramm.com/general/a-post-about-kickstarter-20120711"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I've written about before</a>). Most of the press this movement has gotten is around huge projects, with multimillion dollar budgets and hundreds of thousands of backers. But I've also heard from game developers who've funded their projects here and other Indiegogo users who have found a great community of backers by creating a even just a tiny project, connecting people in a powerful way by grouping them up around a shared goal. That is fascinating to me, and so I started considering just how I might use crowdfunding in a way that could, yes, help me support my trip financially, but also bring my friends and readers together in a really fun and exciting shared experience.</p>
<p>So this project is the result of all that thinking. I have no idea if this will work, and it's very possible this just won't get funded. You may think it's selfish of me to try to take people's money for my own travel (in fact, given my budget for this trip, I'm likely losing money even if this does reach its funding). But I'm genuinely excited by the possibilities here, and I really like the idea of not just using Indiegogo and crowdfunding to fund some ethereal promise of a product, but to enrich both my and your experiences as we travel together through the world. If you agree that could be cool, please do consider backing.</p>
<h3><strong>My Itinerary (Or, What You'll Be Hearing About As a Backer)</strong></h3>

<p><em>Q: Mike, I just donated! When do I get to give you my request or hear about my reward?</em></p>
<p>A: First, thanks! You rock! Second, let's get this thing funded first, and then once all of the backers are set, I will send out emails and make sure I have everything in place. After that, I'll send out things during and after the trip, so you should get your postcards, pictures and souvenirs soon after that. I'll get photo requests before I leave, and then email them out when they're ready.</p>
<p><em>Q: Will you ship perks overseas to the UK or Europe?</em></p>
<p>A: I will! All of these perks should be able to be shipped overseas without any extra fees or charges, so you can put in your support without worry. It may take a bit longer, but it'll get there. If there's an issue, you can let me know and I will take care of it to your (reasonable, of course) satisfaction.</p>

<p> </p></div>","I've been working on the Internet for a long, long time now. You may have read my work on TUAW.com or Joystiq.com, or maybe you've seen my tweets at @mikeschramm or some of my posts at mikeschramm.com. Maybe you've heard me on The Incredible Podcast of Amazing Awesomeness, or any of the many guest spots I've done on various great shows and sites. Or maybe you were just browsing around Indiegogo and found this project. No matter what, welcome!
I'm Going On A Trip
Last year, I took a trip to Europe for the first time, taking a whole month and visiting London, Paris, Berlin, and Prague. While on that trip, I posted on my blog daily, and both the trip and the experience of writing about it every day were very meaningful for me. It helped me a lot, to organize my thoughts and take in everything that was happening around me. And a lot of people who read those posts said they really enjoyed them. I'm a good writer, and a lot of people told me that it felt like they were off on the trip with me, seeing the world over there through my eyes.
This year, I've been invited to two events a little closer to home, coming up between the dates of June 20, 2013 and July 8. On June 22, my cousin is getting married in Denver, Colorado -- she and her girlfriend have been together for a long time, and they're very happy that as of this year, they can finally officially tie the knot. And then, on July 5, I've made plans to visit the great (and Kickstarter-backed!) Nerdtacular, an annual celebration of nerds and all of the things that they love.
I was planning to go online and buy two plane tickets for these trips, but then I remembered my European trip and how much fun it was to explore the world a little bit, and then share what I saw with everyone else online. How great would it be, I thought, if I drove 2,000 miles around the US instead, up from LA through the desert and across the Rockies to Colorado for my cousin's wedding, and then north to Nerdtacular and Salt Lake City and all of my friends there before heading back home?
So that's what I've decided to do.
... And I'm Crowdfunding It
I've also been thinking lately about Kickstarter and Indiegogo and crowdfunding, and how it works (something I've written about before). Most of the press this movement has gotten is around huge projects, with multimillion dollar budgets and hundreds of thousands of backers. But I've also heard from game developers who've funded their projects here and other Indiegogo users who have found a great community of backers by creating a even just a tiny project, connecting people in a powerful way by grouping them up around a shared goal. That is fascinating to me, and so I started considering just how I might use crowdfunding in a way that could, yes, help me support my trip financially, but also bring my friends and readers together in a really fun and exciting shared experience.
So this project is the result of all that thinking. I have no idea if this will work, and it's very possible this just won't get funded. You may think it's selfish of me to try to take people's money for my own travel (in fact, given my budget for this trip, I'm likely losing money even if this does reach its funding). But I'm genuinely excited by the possibilities here, and I really like the idea of not just using Indiegogo and crowdfunding to fund some ethereal promise of a product, but to enrich both my and your experiences as we travel together through the world. If you agree that could be cool, please do consider backing.
My Itinerary (Or, What You'll Be Hearing About As a Backer)
I do need to be in Denver for my cousin's wedding and in Salt Lake City for the Nerdtacular conference (and I will be writing about both), but other than that, my travels will be pretty open. I do have a few things I'm planning on seeing, however.

I'm a big fan of the Rockies (the mountains, not really the baseball team), but I haven't spent a lot of time there. So I'd like to climb a mountain. Doesn't have to be a big mountain -- a small one will suffice. But I plan to reach a summit at some point.
How can I not visit a place called Dinosaur National Monument?
I plan to visit the Columbine Memorial while in Colorado.
In Southern Wyoming, there is something called the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area. That's a yes.
I am a big fan of tourist traps, diners, and townie bars, so I'll be hitting a few of those.
And I plan to spend some time in Salt Lake City studying the history of that place. I know very little about the Mormon faith and its history (There was a guy? And he had some wives? I think?), and I'm interested in learning a lot more, so I hope to visit some historical sites there.
I hear there's an actual salt lake around there somewhere. Can you swim in it? I would like to try.
I am told by a friend that he would like to take me to a firing range (for the first time in my life) while in Utah, so I will probably do that.

Kendra has taught numerous workshops on the history and how-to of fashion and costume, including wig styling, primarily for the Greater Bay Area Costumers Guild and Costume College.  She is on the board of the Costume Society of America's Western Region, and is a past president of the Greater Bay Area Costumer's Guild.
You can read more about Kendra's costuming and research at her website, Demode, where she blogs about her research and projectsWhat Happens If I Don't Meet My Funding Goal?Those who pre-order will still receive a copy of the book (and any perks), but I'll have to revise the book to be less fabulous:  cut some of the history and/or one of the hairstyles (to shorten the page length), or print it using less quality paper and binding.
Most importantly, the number of copies available will be limited.  It may end up that I can only afford to print enough for those who pre-order!  In other words, if you don't pre-order the book, you may not be able to buy one later!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Robert Tomoguchi and I am the author of the Me and My Friend Maddie Gothic Book Series available on Amazon and InkBleedBooks.com. </p>
<p>I am currently writing Book 3 of the series which will be titled: ""A Goth Noob Picnic in the Cemetery Where DJ Dumbshit is Buried."" This is the follow up book to ""Goth Girls Don't Taste Like Chicken"" and ""So This Bitch...""</p>
<p>My campaign is important to me because I have learned after publishing my first two books that publishing is an expensive endeavor and because of this it makes it difficult to fund the production and promotion of a new book. I have already begun to develop an audience around the world and would like nothing more than to keep my book series going for my readers. </p>
<p>My books are very important to me and I am committed to publishing Book 3 no matter how much or how little I receive through crowdfunding. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The most important expenses in producing my books is to pay those involved in the project. This includes my illustrator, cover designer, and typesetter. My proofreader has graciously donated her time and skills for the first two books at no cost, but for this third book, it would be nice to be able to pay her a little something. </p>
<p>I have a list of prizes for those who contribute $10 or more, but any amount helps.</p>
<p>Any funds received in excess of the $1,000 I am attempting to raise will go toward other production expenses and copies of books. No funds will go into my own pocket.</p>

<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, there is still a ton you can do to help that doesn't cost a cent. And that is to help spread the word about this fundraising campaign and to tell people about my books. </p>

Portraits are presented without judgment or stereotype by eliminating environmental influence with a stark white backdrop.</p><p>This backdrop acts as a blank canvas, where each subject’s personal thoughts are handwritten onto the final photographic print. With more than sixty-five portraits photographed over a period of ten years, Speaking OUT provides rare insight into the passions, confusions, prejudices, joys, and sorrows felt by queer youth.</p><p>Speaking OUT gives a voice to an under-served group of people that are seldom heard and often silenced. The collaboration of image and first-person narrative serves to provide an outlet, show support, create dialogue, and help those who struggle. It not only shows unity within the LGBTQ community, but also commonalities regardless of age, race, gender, and sexual orientation. With recent media attention and the success of initiatives such as the It Gets Better Project, resources for queer youth have grown. Still, a void exists which Speaking OUT directly addresses: this book is for youth, by youth.</p><p>Speaking OUT is an award-winning, nationally and internationally shown and published body of work. These images have been published in magazines such as the Advocate, School Library Journal, Curve, Girlfriends, and Out, and showcased by the Human Rights Campaign, National Public Radio, Public Television, and the U.S. Department of Education. The work continues to show in galleries, universities, youth centers, and churches around the world.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/587683/files/20140518122516-4_1.jpg?1400441116"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/587692/files/20140518123009-2_1.jpg?1400441409"" src="""" style=""""/>                              <a href=""http://rachelleleesmith.com/speakingout/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE FOR MORE SINGLE IMAGES</a><a href=""www.rachelleleesmith.com/speakingout"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h3>WHERE WE'VE BEEN:</h3><p><b>EXHIBITIONS</b></p><p>Shippensburg University, Gender Reel Festival, West Hill United Church, US Department of Education Federal LGBT Youth Summit, Mazzoni Health Center Gala, Identity Youth Center, The Cube Gallery, Santa Clara University, The University of Maryland, William Way Community Center Art Gallery, Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Headquarters, III Warsaw Festival of Photography, The University of the Arts,True Expression Center Gallery, Syracuse University, Equality Forum Art Show with Young Gay America, Photo Review Awards Show, Space 315, University of Florida, The Society for Photographic Education</p><p><b>MAGAZINES &amp; ONLINE</b></p><p>Tikkun Daily, Zannegaar, Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) Iran Program, Philadelphia Gay News, Philadelphia Magazine – G Philly, Out in Jersey, CNS News, US Department of Education, SheWired.org, PhotoArt Mag and PhotoArt.cz, Philadelphia Inquirer, Leeway Foundation, Human Rights Campaign – Equality, Rutgers University – Answer, The Washington Blade, TheNewGay.net, III Warszawski Festiwal Fotigrafii Artystycznej, Arcadia University – Tower, Out and About, School Library Journal, Mane Aktuell, Out Magazine, NYC Gay City News, Girlfriends Magazine, Visions, Reaching Out- Law School Admission Council, WYBE: “Philly Live”,  Philadelphia Daily News, Temple News, YoungGayAmerica Magazine, Philly Weekly, Syracuse University Newspaper, Photo Review, The Advocate, Curve Magazine</p><br/><h3>WHERE WE WILL GO (with your help):</h3><p><b>EVERYWHERE</b></p><p>Libraries, Schools, Universities, Dentist Offices, Youth Centers, Community Centers, Galleries, Book Stores, Counseling Centers, Your Parent’s House, Your Brother's Coffee Table, Your Sister's Desk, A Teen’s Book Shelf, Homes Around the World…</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">YOUR HANDS!</span><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></p><p><br/><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">WHERE THE FUNDS WILL GO:</span><br/></p><p>Producing a book costs a lot.  Printing a full color photo book costs quite a bit more.</p><p>A lot of the work (traveling, camera equipment, lighting gear, film, processing, paper, image printing costs) is behind us, but, in order to get this book to be affordable to a wide reaching audience, we need money for:</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p>Designing<p></p><p>Editing</p><p>Printing</p><p>Shipping</p><p>Storing</p><p>Marketing</p><p>Advertising</p><p>But ultimately the money is going to THE VISIBILITY OF QUEER YOUTH </p><p>Anything over the goal will allow us to travel with a show of the work!</p><p></p><p>Showing</p><p>Traveling</p><p></p><b>PERKS:</b><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/587829/files/20140518133100-Perks.jpg?1400445060"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>ACCOLADES:</h3><p><b>Perez Hilton – Blogger and Television Personality</b></p><p>Rachelle Lee Smith has created a book that is not only visually stunning but also gripping with powerful words and even more inspiring young people!

Giampolo, Esquire  – LGBT Advocate, Lawyer and Media Personality</b></p><p>I highly recommend that everyone hurry up and buy Speaking OUT: Queer Youth in Focus now!  My friend, colleague and esteemed award-winning photographer, Rachelle Lee Smith, has spent over a decade photographing and memorializing queer youth in a way that showcases the struggle we have ALL faced while coming of age and coming to terms with who we are.  This book is so powerful that you even see the present struggles the kids are facing through one look captured from a certain angle.  As you turn the pages, you’re hit at your core and brought back to a memory of something you have or are currently dealing with.  It’s truly a transformative book published during a time in our collective LGBTQ history when we should be focusing on our queer youth as our future as well as acknowledging and accepting our own personal struggles.</p><p><b>David Graham <b>–</b> Photographer, author Taking Liberties, Almost Paradise</b></p><p>The perfectly executed photographs, the passionate handwritten text, the insights, secrets and revelations all combine to make this a powerful body of work. Ms. Smith has shown a light on a group of young people and illuminated the world in which they live.</p><p><b>Liz Moore – Author, Heft, The Words of Every Song  </b></p><p>Rachelle Lee Smith's art captures something essential about each of her subjects; it transcends the static nature of photography and makes each person come to vivid life on the page. Their written words amplify this sensation. Smith is an artist to watch.</p><p><b>Dr. Warren J. Blumenfeld, Ed.D. – Professor, Iowa State, University of Massachusetts</b></p><p>The young people profiled in this remarkable book represent the tip of the volcano of a new generation transforming and revolutionizing the society and its institutions by challenging overall power inequities related not only to sexuality and gender identity categorizations and hierarchies, but they are also making links in the various types of oppression, and are forming coalitions with other marginalized groups. Their stories, experiences, and activism have great potential to bring us to a future where people across gender and sexuality spectrums will live freely, unencumbered by social taboos and cultural norms of gender and sexuality.</p><p><b>Ryan Sallans –  Transgender Speaker and Author of Second Son: Transitioning Toward My Destiny, Love and Life</b></p><p>The power of a look, a pose, and a story can be seen through Rachelle Lee Smith’s photography and the youth who opened up their raw emotions, insecurities and celebrations to us all. Sharing stories saves lives, but also reminds us that there can be continual struggle in finding identity and acceptance.</p><p><b>Innosanto Nagara –  Author, A is for Activist, Cofounder, Design Action Collective, Oakland</b></p><p>This is a STUNNING book. And it's important. It's important that the next generation is SEEN the way it sees itself. We rightfully put a lot of emphasis on being heard—on words. But a picture is worth a thousand words, and this book's striking focus on the AESTHETICS of this group of queer youth is thoroughly refreshing. Bravo!</p><p><b>Ed Hermance <b>–</b> Owner Giovanni’s Room, the oldest LGBT book store in America </b></p><p>It's wonderful to see so many happy kids. You wouldn't have seen such a crowd fifty years ago.  Sometimes things do get better.</p><p><b>Mark Segal <b>–</b> Publisher, Philadelphia Gay News and the nations most awarded LGBT journalist</b></p><p>It's often said that our youth are our future.  In the LGBT community before they become the future we must help them survive today.  This book showcases the diversity of creative imagination it takes to get us to tomorrow.  </p><p><b>Gretta Vosper <b>–</b> Minister and author With or Without God: Why the Way We Live is More Important than What We Believe</b></p><p>Photography, as its most basic, is a juxtaposition of light and darkness.

Her involvement in the movement for queer equality began when her brother, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-GA., was elected House speaker.An afterword by Graeme Taylor- At age 14, Graeme skyrocketed to international attention when he confronted a school board for not defending gay rights in it’s schools. In the process, Graeme became one of the youngest and most widely known openly gay teens in America. He was interviewed on MSNBC’s Jansing & Co. and the Ellen Degeneres Show and is now the subject of a short film, ShrugSTATEMENT:Speaking OUT: Queer Youth in Focus is a photographic essay that explores a wide spectrum of experiences told from the perspective of a diverse group of young people, ages fourteen to twenty-four, identifying as queer (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning). Portraits are presented without judgment or stereotype by eliminating environmental influence with a stark white backdrop.This backdrop acts as a blank canvas, where each subject’s personal thoughts are handwritten onto the final photographic print. With more than sixty-five portraits photographed over a period of ten years, Speaking OUT provides rare insight into the passions, confusions, prejudices, joys, and sorrows felt by queer youth.Speaking OUT gives a voice to an under-served group of people that are seldom heard and often silenced. The collaboration of image and first-person narrative serves to provide an outlet, show support, create dialogue, and help those who struggle. It not only shows unity within the LGBTQ community, but also commonalities regardless of age, race, gender, and sexual orientation. With recent media attention and the success of initiatives such as the It Gets Better Project, resources for queer youth have grown. Still, a void exists which Speaking OUT directly addresses: this book is for youth, by youth.Speaking OUT is an award-winning, nationally and internationally shown and published body of work. These images have been published in magazines such as the Advocate, School Library Journal, Curve, Girlfriends, and Out, and showcased by the Human Rights Campaign, National Public Radio, Public Television, and the U.S. Department of Education.

Ms. Smith has shown a light on a group of young people and illuminated the world in which they live.Liz Moore – Author, Heft, The Words of Every Song  Rachelle Lee Smith's art captures something essential about each of her subjects; it transcends the static nature of photography and makes each person come to vivid life on the page. Their written words amplify this sensation. Smith is an artist to watch.Dr. Warren J. Blumenfeld, Ed.D. – Professor, Iowa State, University of MassachusettsThe young people profiled in this remarkable book represent the tip of the volcano of a new generation transforming and revolutionizing the society and its institutions by challenging overall power inequities related not only to sexuality and gender identity categorizations and hierarchies, but they are also making links in the various types of oppression, and are forming coalitions with other marginalized groups. Their stories, experiences, and activism have great potential to bring us to a future where people across gender and sexuality spectrums will live freely, unencumbered by social taboos and cultural norms of gender and sexuality.Ryan Sallans –  Transgender Speaker and Author of Second Son: Transitioning Toward My Destiny, Love and LifeThe power of a look, a pose, and a story can be seen through Rachelle Lee Smith’s photography and the youth who opened up their raw emotions, insecurities and celebrations to us all. Sharing stories saves lives, but also reminds us that there can be continual struggle in finding identity and acceptance.Innosanto Nagara –  Author, A is for Activist, Cofounder, Design Action Collective, OaklandThis is a STUNNING book. And it's important. It's important that the next generation is SEEN the way it sees itself. We rightfully put a lot of emphasis on being heard—on words. But a picture is worth a thousand words, and this book's striking focus on the AESTHETICS of this group of queer youth is thoroughly refreshing. Bravo!Ed Hermance – Owner Giovanni’s Room, the oldest LGBT book store in America It's wonderful to see so many happy kids. You wouldn't have seen such a crowd fifty years ago.  Sometimes things do get better.Mark Segal – Publisher, Philadelphia Gay News and the nations most awarded LGBT journalistIt's often said that our youth are our future.  In the LGBT community before they become the future we must help them survive today.  This book showcases the diversity of creative imagination it takes to get us to tomorrow.  Gretta Vosper – Minister and author With or Without God: Why the Way We Live is More Important than What We BelievePhotography, as its most basic, is a juxtaposition of light and darkness. Capturing an image with the perfect blend of these two things is an art. Rachelle Lee Smith achieves that high standing and raises the bar by bringing not only the light and darkness of the image into focus but also the light and darkness of her subjects.

<p>Hi, I'm Jean Owen. Most of
you know my sister Shanti, also known as Patty Owen to our family and friends from her super model days. Most of you also know that Shanti has been writing her memoirs about her sex/love
addiction for the past three years. Well, Shanti needs your help right now. She has plowed through her savings and maxed out her credit cards to finance her writing. She is so very close to completion and needs your support!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have never seen my sister more dedicated to anything as she has been to her memoirs and
her sobriety. Shanti is clear that her revelations will be embarrassing,
incriminating, and could prevent her from attaining future work. But
she is whole heartedly committed to taking the shame out of sex
addiction. It is an addiction, like any other, and quite
debilitating. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I encouraged my sister to
create a crowd funding campaign. Okay, that's a lie. I strong armed
her into it! Shanti stopped working three years ago to write her
memoirs. As her sister, I know ALL about this sexual roller coaster
ride of hers. She had fun for some of it, not going to lie about that
either. But she also suffered greatly with it, especially her years
with her recent ex-husband. Swinger parties, orgies, and prostitution
were second nature to her by then. But when our mother passed in July
of 2011, Shanti finally woke up and decided to stop this sexual
freight train. Our 52-year-old hooker. Go figure! But if there was
ever a way to do something outlandish, my sister has always
found a way. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By October of 2011, Shanti
had no husband, no income, no mother, and her daughter moved out to begin college. With her empty nest and empty bank accounts, Shanti began
the painful task of getting sober from this sex/love addiction. Her
memoirs chronicle a life of sexual abuse that she never even told
me about. That is how much shame she had. But my mother's death freed
her, thanks Mom, and she wants to share her revelations and triumphs
with the world.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shanti has been sex sober
for three years now and happier than ever. She wants to share with
you her crazy ride and mostly, her journey into wholeness.
PLEASE GIVE GENEROUSLY. I love my sister. Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, below is what Shanti wants to tell you. Mine is better. Sister rivalry runs deep!</p>

<p>“After
my wild ride in the 80's as an international super model and a
painful stint of sexual harassment in Hollywood, I left the life of
glitz and glamour to heal my sexual abuse wounds on a deep spiritual journey spanning several years. But when I returned to NYC, all my old demons were still
waiting. Not even the conservative corporate environment of law could
stop me.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Born
of extreme pain and fueled by the terror of coming close to that
pain, a serial sex addict joined the path of promiscuity. My former
path to enlightenment; meditation, prayer, and service,
became the souvenirs of a time long past. If I can't be the perfect
nun then let me be the perfect slut!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>When I crashed from my
sex addiction three years ago, I was devastated.</b> I had just
buried my mother, my only child moved cross country to begin
college, and I threw my husband out for his infidelities. But why
would I care if my husband was sleeping around? I was making money as
a 52-year-old prostitute. Initially I blamed my husband for what I became for he supported it. But I knew, after weeks of ranting at his
sexual misconduct, that nothing comes to us by accident. What I saw
in him was merely a reflection of my own shadow.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Though I didn't know how
to survive without income from prostitution</b>, I quit cold turkey.
Living alone it was finally safe to look at this sexual beast in the
eye. I went through intense therapy, 12-step programs, and
recommitted to my spiritual journey. But when I researched information about women with sex addictions, I discovered that most
of the literature was geared towards men. Though extremely embarrassed to be so
exposed, I knew then that I needed to get this information out. I was
not the only woman suffering with this addiction. I had met many lost
souls along the journey with me.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>I've gone through all of
my savings and have exhausted my credit lines</b>. Yet I have a few more
months before the book is complete and then shopping for a literary agent, publisher, and onwards toward the big
and small screens. Any and all of your <b>SUPPORT </b>is <b>GREATLY

<b>Brief description of campaign and why it's important to me.</b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>My campaign is to raise money so that I can finish my memoirs, find a literary agent, publisher, then a film/TV producer. I am currently working with my developmental editor and we are only a couple of months away from completion. THREE YEARS of YAY!!!</div>
<div>It is beyond important that my memoirs get published for I know that many suffer in silence with sex/love addictions. If coming out with my dirty secrets will help millions, than I am ready to wash my ego.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> <li><b>Magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve.</b></li> </ul> <p>Your contributors will totally support me in realizing my dream! I want to be the poster child for sex/love addictions so that others will also find the courage to come forward and heal. Helping others is why I am doing this. I am taking a huge risk by exposing my past but it will all be worth it when those that have stayed in the shadows finally come back out into the light.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need </h3>
<ul>
<li>35k funding  (see breakdown below)</li>
<li>12k living expenses for next 6 months (to finish memoirs and promote)</li>
<li>10k developmental editor</li>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sex addiction is directly related to sex trafficking. If we, as a global community, do not heal our intimacy issues, sex trafficking will continue to spiral out of control. Sex trafficking recently surpassed illegal arm sales and now poised to surpass illegal drug sales as the #1 illegal business in the world. Sex trafficking grossed over 32 billion dollars in 2013. Your contribution to my campaign will have a direct impact on the dissolution of sex trafficking rings. Less sexual demand, less sexual supply needed. It's that simple.</li>
<li>I have a history of success in every field I have ever endeavored; from championship track &amp; field events in high school &amp; college, super model career, acting (Miami Vice), executive legal secretary, and relationship coach (ABC reality show appearance). Finally, I am unveiling my writing talents that all my teachers from grade school through college have encouraged me to pursue. In 5th grade I received a congratulatory letter from the White House during the Nixon administration for my essay concerning the environment and my proposed protection plans. Not much has changed. The activist lives powerfully within me and I continue to write.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Greatest challenge may be that I don't find a traditional publisher in the next six months. However, if that's the case, I will begin by self publishing so you can start reading Memoirs of a Legal Courtesan sooner! </p>
<p>I may lose heart temporarily but I never give up. I am a born fighter. The greater the challenge the harder I fight!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some of you might not be able to contribute financially at this time. I totally understand this. Been in this spot for three years now. But you can still help!</p> <ul> <li>You can get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li>Share my campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, and Google +.</li>
<li>Forward the campaign via email and snail mail.</li>
<li>Call a friend in 12-step programs that understands the addiction struggle and may want to support my campaign to take the shame out of sex/love addictions.</li> <li>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Hi, I'm Jean Owen. Most of

glitz and glamour to heal my sexual abuse wounds on a deep spiritual journey spanning several years. But when I returned to NYC, all my old demons were still
waiting. Not even the conservative corporate environment of law could
stop me.


Born
of extreme pain and fueled by the terror of coming close to that
pain, a serial sex addict joined the path of promiscuity. My former
path to enlightenment; meditation, prayer, and service,
became the souvenirs of a time long past. If I can't be the perfect
nun then let me be the perfect slut!”



When I crashed from my
sex addiction three years ago, I was devastated. I had just
buried my mother, my only child moved cross country to begin
college, and I threw my husband out for his infidelities. But why
would I care if my husband was sleeping around? I was making money as
a 52-year-old prostitute. Initially I blamed my husband for what I became for he supported it. But I knew, after weeks of ranting at his
sexual misconduct, that nothing comes to us by accident. What I saw
in him was merely a reflection of my own shadow.


Though I didn't know how
to survive without income from prostitution, I quit cold turkey.
Living alone it was finally safe to look at this sexual beast in the
eye. I went through intense therapy, 12-step programs, and
recommitted to my spiritual journey. But when I researched information about women with sex addictions, I discovered that most
of the literature was geared towards men. Though extremely embarrassed to be so
exposed, I knew then that I needed to get this information out. I was
not the only woman suffering with this addiction. I had met many lost
souls along the journey with me.


I've gone through all of
my savings and have exhausted my credit lines. Yet I have a few more
months before the book is complete and then shopping for a literary agent, publisher, and onwards toward the big
and small screens. Any and all of your SUPPORT is GREATLY
APPRECIATED!

Brief description of campaign and why it's important to me.


My campaign is to raise money so that I can finish my memoirs, find a literary agent, publisher, then a film/TV producer. I am currently working with my developmental editor and we are only a couple of months away from completion. THREE YEARS of YAY!!!
It is beyond important that my memoirs get published for I know that many suffer in silence with sex/love addictions. If coming out with my dirty secrets will help millions, than I am ready to wash my ego.

 Magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve.  Your contributors will totally support me in realizing my dream! I want to be the poster child for sex/love addictions so that others will also find the courage to come forward and heal. Helping others is why I am doing this. I am taking a huge risk by exposing my past but it will all be worth it when those that have stayed in the shadows finally come back out into the light.   What I Need 

35k funding  (see breakdown below)
12k living expenses for next 6 months (to finish memoirs and promote)
10k developmental editor
  5k proof reader
  3k book design
  3k travel expenses to LA for book/film/TV promotion
  2k Indiegogo campaign fees  



 What If Entire Financial Goal Not Met?
I will spend only one more month writing full time then look for a job. Memoirs will take longer to complete but they will be complete!



  2k living expenses for next month  


10k developmental editor


  5k proof reader


  3k book design

  2k Indiegogo campaign fees

What You Get - Unique Perks





Acknowledgment in memoirs! 


Signed copy of my 30-page modeling portfolio!!


12 hours with Shanti!! (coaching if desired)

   The Impact

Sex addiction is directly related to sex trafficking. If we, as a global community, do not heal our intimacy issues, sex trafficking will continue to spiral out of control. Sex trafficking recently surpassed illegal arm sales and now poised to surpass illegal drug sales as the #1 illegal business in the world. Sex trafficking grossed over 32 billion dollars in 2013. Your contribution to my campaign will have a direct impact on the dissolution of sex trafficking rings. Less sexual demand, less sexual supply needed. It's that simple.
I have a history of success in every field I have ever endeavored; from championship track & field events in high school & college, super model career, acting (Miami Vice), executive legal secretary, and relationship coach (ABC reality show appearance). Finally, I am unveiling my writing talents that all my teachers from grade school through college have encouraged me to pursue. In 5th grade I received a congratulatory letter from the White House during the Nixon administration for my essay concerning the environment and my proposed protection plans. Not much has changed. The activist lives powerfully within me and I continue to write.    Risks & Challenges
Greatest challenge may be that I don't find a traditional publisher in the next six months. However, if that's the case, I will begin by self publishing so you can start reading Memoirs of a Legal Courtesan sooner! 
I may lose heart temporarily but I never give up. I am a born fighter. The greater the challenge the harder I fight!   Other Ways You Can Help Some of you might not be able to contribute financially at this time. I totally understand this. Been in this spot for three years now. But you can still help!  You can get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.

<div>My name is Jeff Slack.  I've spent the last 20+ years working with people in church ministry in the southern California area.  I'm a husband, a dad and a dog lover.  Throughout my years in ministry I have written many curriculum pieces which have been published; wrote and produced an award-winning multimedia curriculum on adoption; and wrote and self-published a book for families to grow closer together.</div>
<div><b>Why am I doing this?</b></div>
<div>I believe men today need to be challenged to look beyond their past failures.  Sand In My Teeth is a book to challenge men to think of their legacies rather then those failures from their journeys that drive so many of us men toward frustration and exhaustion.  Complete with biblical small group questions, Sand In My Teeth is a book which challenges men to understand God can use those past failures for His glory but the real place we should focus on is what's ahead.  Utilizing some of my own stories from my chaotic, embarrassing and dysfunctional upbringing, I hope to engage men in a very real and honest place to help them understand nothing is impossible with God.</div>
<div><b>Why Do I Need Your Help?</b></div>
<div>I understand that I cannot do this on my own.  Because I lack the bigger platform that publishers require to publish a book like this, I need to reach out to my friends to make this a reality.  With you partnering with me to produce this book, I believe we can provide a resource to good men that will help them become better men.</div>

<div>We will be publishing through Westbow Press, which is the self-publishing wing of both Thomas Nelson and Zondervan Publishers.  Although there are less expensive routes to self-publish, this will allow us to utilize their great resources to both publish and market the book in the Christian marketplace.</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Over the last four years, Dennis and Jill Corley have traveled to over 11 countries dedicating their time to the creative writing program they created and founded One World, Many Stories. Through this program they have taught youth to build longlasting relationships between their cultures as they exchanged and shared their life stories. While sharing thier stories over 100 youth have created a culture of diversity and respect for one another.</p>
<p> Both Dennis and Jill are professional grantwriters who now spend part of their time writing grants for agencies world wide and presenting ‘Zen’ Grant Writing Workshops. </p>
<p> With their interest in the Mayans Dennis and Jill wish to complete and publish their next book----  'A Better Life, 2013, On a Higher Road’, a story of the Mayans in Belize, the Honduras, the Yucatan and Guatemala. Pl.ease find below the description of what the book will be about</p>
<p><strong>And we don’t know what to believe anymore</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Better Life, 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Higher Road</strong></p>
<p>Read and listen to the stories of 2012 from the elderly Mayans of the Yucatan, Honduras, Belize and Guatemala. Explore the meaning of life as a Mayan and what the significance of December 21, 2012 is to them.   <em>A Better Life, 2013, On a Higher Road</em>, is a 100+ page, hardcover photography and traditional Mayan story book featuring elderly Mayans. With quotes, photographs traditional stories and beliefs about the end of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, 2012, from the eldest surviving Mayan population.</p>
<p>Additional quotes from Scholars, experts of eschatological beliefs of different religions will also be present throughout the book</p>
<p><strong> A few of the people and agencies that we will approach to appear in the book:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mayans and Mayanist’s and others</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mayans</strong></p>
<p>Cornerstone Foundation – Belize – Mayan Elders</p>
<p>Maya Foundation in Laakeech A.C. – Yucatan – Mayan Elders</p>
<p>Dar a Luz Honduras – Honduras – Mayan Elders</p>
<p>La Asociacion Nuestros Ahijados – Guatemala – Mayan Elders</p>
<p><strong>Mayanist’s</strong></p>
<p>Mark Van Stone-Maya Expert</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong></p>
<p>Ron Price-Ba Hai i’ Expert</p>
<p>Terry Nazon-Astrologer</p>
<p>Arlie Petters- Mathematician from Belize</p>
<p>…and many more!</p>
<p>Each portrait will be paired with their own short story, the subject about —– some aspect of joy, the meaning, the passion, and the belief of the Mayan calendar and the date December 21, 2012. These stories could focus on the pleasure of a treasured tradition, the impact of a powerful experience, the level of consciousness of a Mayan Shaman in the year 2012 and beyond, or many other topics.</p>
<p>The finished product will be a 6″x10″, 100+ pages, and cloth-bound, hardcover, professionally printed photography book in full color on thick, #100 paper stock. Printed in the USA. We will be printing 5,000 copies of the book.</p>
<p>We are planning to travel to over 11 cities, 2 in the Yucatan, 1 in Belize, 1 in the Honduras, and 7 in Guatemala, photographing and gathering stories from the elderly Mayans in their own settings and villages reflecting the true life a Mayan. The whole project will take roughly nine months to complete. The book will then be published ending on January 21, 2013</p>
<p><strong>2012</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>2012 phenomenon</strong> comprises a range of eschatological beliefs according to which cataclysmic or transformative events will occur on December 21, 2012. This date is regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae have been proposed as pertaining to this date, though none have been accepted by mainstream scholarship.</p>
<p>A New Age interpretation of this transition is that this date marks the start of time in which Earth and its inhabitants may undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 2012 may mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggest that the 2012 date marks the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world include the arrival of the next solar maximum, or Earth’s collision with a black hole, passing asteroid or a planet called “Nibiru.</p>
<p>Scholars from various disciplines have dismissed the idea of such cataclysmic events occurring in 2012. Professional Mayanist scholars state that predictions of impending doom are not found in any of the extant classic Maya accounts, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar “ends” in 2012 misrepresents Maya history and culture. Astronomers and other scientists have rejected the proposed events as pseudoscience, stating that they are contradicted by simple astronomical observations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p>December 21<sup>st</sup> 2012 – a date that is well known globally. Several hundred years ago, the Ancient Mayans predicted the apocalypse on this very date. With their 5,125 year old calendar resetting itself to 0.0.0.0. on this date, many are preparing for the worst. However, how legit is the <strong>prophecy of the Mayans</strong>? </p>
<p>The goal and impact of this book is to dispel the common misconception that the end of the world is near with hope that we can instill the belief that there is a new transcendental age coming according to the direct belief of the Mayans.  We hope this book can reach out and serve as an inspiration. Hopefully this project will show the world that the belief of the Mayans and the Mayan Calendar is a road to a better life, a life of unity among all people in the world.</p>
<p>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As of March 2012, We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed and began to write the preliminary manuscript</li>
<li>Researched and contacted all preliminary story-tellers and experts on the Mayan philosophy.</li>
</ul>
<div>That's a good start, but it's a long way from a clean, polished final product. <strong>With the money we raise through this campaign, we will purchase</strong>:</div>
<ul>
<li>Line-by-line editing by two different professional editors</li>
<li>Purchase of an additional professional camera</li>
<li>Professional photography editing and printing</li>
<li>Professional interior design (i.e. typesetting)</li>
<li>Professional cover design (physical book)</li>
<li>ISBN, copyright, and Library of Congress registration</li>
<li>Proof printing and the initial print run to send to IndieGoGo contributers</li>
<li>Additional copies of the book to send to alternative potential reviewers</li>
<li>Postage &amp; supplies necessary to mail everything</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong><em>These are the investments necessary to produce a beautiful photography storybook.</em></strong> <strong>By raising $7500 or more by April 23, 2012,</strong> we can secure the editorial, design, and printing services necessary to create a professional book that influential people will take seriously and then <em>further spread its message.</em>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>We are independently publishing our book</strong> in order to retain full rights to the work. That way we can give away free copies to those who enjoy it most, offer special discounts, and run innovative fundraisers like this one! <strong>By supporting this campaign you're supporting a 100% indie publishing venture!</strong></p>
</div>
</div>

<div> </div></div>","Our Story
Over the last four years, Dennis and Jill Corley have traveled to over 11 countries dedicating their time to the creative writing program they created and founded One World, Many Stories. Through this program they have taught youth to build longlasting relationships between their cultures as they exchanged and shared their life stories. While sharing thier stories over 100 youth have created a culture of diversity and respect for one another.
 Both Dennis and Jill are professional grantwriters who now spend part of their time writing grants for agencies world wide and presenting ‘Zen’ Grant Writing Workshops. 
 With their interest in the Mayans Dennis and Jill wish to complete and publish their next book----  'A Better Life, 2013, On a Higher Road’, a story of the Mayans in Belize, the Honduras, the Yucatan and Guatemala. Pl.ease find below the description of what the book will be about
And we don’t know what to believe anymore
A Better Life, 2013
A Higher Road
Read and listen to the stories of 2012 from the elderly Mayans of the Yucatan, Honduras, Belize and Guatemala. Explore the meaning of life as a Mayan and what the significance of December 21, 2012 is to them.   A Better Life, 2013, On a Higher Road, is a 100+ page, hardcover photography and traditional Mayan story book featuring elderly Mayans. With quotes, photographs traditional stories and beliefs about the end of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, 2012, from the eldest surviving Mayan population.
Additional quotes from Scholars, experts of eschatological beliefs of different religions will also be present throughout the book
 A few of the people and agencies that we will approach to appear in the book:
Mayans and Mayanist’s and others
Mayans
Cornerstone Foundation – Belize – Mayan Elders
Maya Foundation in Laakeech A.C. – Yucatan – Mayan Elders
Dar a Luz Honduras – Honduras – Mayan Elders
La Asociacion Nuestros Ahijados – Guatemala – Mayan Elders
Mayanist’s
Mark Van Stone-Maya Expert
Others
Ron Price-Ba Hai i’ Expert
Terry Nazon-Astrologer
Arlie Petters- Mathematician from Belize
…and many more!
Each portrait will be paired with their own short story, the subject about —– some aspect of joy, the meaning, the passion, and the belief of the Mayan calendar and the date December 21, 2012. These stories could focus on the pleasure of a treasured tradition, the impact of a powerful experience, the level of consciousness of a Mayan Shaman in the year 2012 and beyond, or many other topics.
The finished product will be a 6″x10″, 100+ pages, and cloth-bound, hardcover, professionally printed photography book in full color on thick, #100 paper stock. Printed in the USA. We will be printing 5,000 copies of the book.
We are planning to travel to over 11 cities, 2 in the Yucatan, 1 in Belize, 1 in the Honduras, and 7 in Guatemala, photographing and gathering stories from the elderly Mayans in their own settings and villages reflecting the true life a Mayan. The whole project will take roughly nine months to complete. The book will then be published ending on January 21, 2013
2012
The 2012 phenomenon comprises a range of eschatological beliefs according to which cataclysmic or transformative events will occur on December 21, 2012. This date is regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae have been proposed as pertaining to this date, though none have been accepted by mainstream scholarship.
A New Age interpretation of this transition is that this date marks the start of time in which Earth and its inhabitants may undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 2012 may mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggest that the 2012 date marks the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world include the arrival of the next solar maximum, or Earth’s collision with a black hole, passing asteroid or a planet called “Nibiru.
Scholars from various disciplines have dismissed the idea of such cataclysmic events occurring in 2012. Professional Mayanist scholars state that predictions of impending doom are not found in any of the extant classic Maya accounts, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar “ends” in 2012 misrepresents Maya history and culture. Astronomers and other scientists have rejected the proposed events as pseudoscience, stating that they are contradicted by simple astronomical observations.


THE IMPACT
December 21st 2012 – a date that is well known globally. Several hundred years ago, the Ancient Mayans predicted the apocalypse on this very date. With their 5,125 year old calendar resetting itself to 0.0.0.0. on this date, many are preparing for the worst. However, how legit is the prophecy of the Mayans? 
The goal and impact of this book is to dispel the common misconception that the end of the world is near with hope that we can instill the belief that there is a new transcendental age coming according to the direct belief of the Mayans.  We hope this book can reach out and serve as an inspiration. Hopefully this project will show the world that the belief of the Mayans and the Mayan Calendar is a road to a better life, a life of unity among all people in the world.
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET


As of March 2012, We have:

Designed and began to write the preliminary manuscript
Researched and contacted all preliminary story-tellers and experts on the Mayan philosophy.

That's a good start, but it's a long way from a clean, polished final product. With the money we raise through this campaign, we will purchase:

Line-by-line editing by two different professional editors
Purchase of an additional professional camera
Professional photography editing and printing
Professional interior design (i.e. typesetting)
Professional cover design (physical book)
ISBN, copyright, and Library of Congress registration
Proof printing and the initial print run to send to IndieGoGo contributers
Additional copies of the book to send to alternative potential reviewers
Postage & supplies necessary to mail everything

 

These are the investments necessary to produce a beautiful photography storybook. By raising $7500 or more by April 23, 2012, we can secure the editorial, design, and printing services necessary to create a professional book that influential people will take seriously and then further spread its message.

 


We are independently publishing our book in order to retain full rights to the work. That way we can give away free copies to those who enjoy it most, offer special discounts, and run innovative fundraisers like this one! By supporting this campaign you're supporting a 100% indie publishing venture!


If we don't meet our $7500 goal, we will still move forward with the project and use whatever funds raised to publish and ship the best possible book. But more funds will equal a better book and an important message spread farther!
 


When Will You Receive the Book?
The planned release date for the book is January 21, 2013. As an IndieGoGo contributer, your books will ship one week early.

<p>I’ve started this campaign in order to make my series entirely self-published, and provide print copies of my bestselling ebooks to readers as perks for contributions.</p>
<p>Through this campaign, my goal is to release a new edition of my first novel under my own publishing imprint. Once I’ve done this, I’ll set a higher goal amount for the campaign, to fund the creation of upcoming books in the series.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>About the Series</strong></p>
<p>Stephanie Ann “Sam” McRae is a tough-talking, lawyer-sleuth, and champion for the underdog. The series is set in the Maryland suburbs, between Baltimore and Washington.</p>
<p>While Sam doesn’t seek out danger, it occasionally finds her. Having been orphaned while young, Sam is willing to go the distance for her clients, because she knows the system from both sides. As a result, she feels an intense loyalty and sense of duty to those in need.</p>
<p>The book trailer embedded above will give you a sense of Sam’s character, as well as the tone and setting of the stories.</p>
<p>In 2011, the first Sam McRae novel, <em>Identity Crisis</em>, made the New York Times ebook bestseller list. That book and the sequel, <em>Least Wanted</em> both became Kindle Top 100 bestsellers. Both novels also went on to reach the Top 100 on Amazon UK, with <em>Least Wanted</em> hitting the Top 10 and reaching at least as high as #6 on the charts. In 2012, I published <em>Riptide</em>, the third novel in the series.</p>

<p> “Of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock once said, ‘There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.’ Author Debbi Mack nails that statement in this tightly written tale about a flawed Maryland attorney, ‘Sam’ McRae, and her relentless search for a killer when the domestic abuse case she has been handling kicks itself up a notch: The accused is found dead and his wife has taken off. Not good. Add to that the FBI, the Mob, identity theft, and a vulnerable main character involved with a married prosecutor and you have a darn good page-turner. Debbi Mack crafts a taut narrative with crackling dialogue.” – Aimee Zuccarini, The Maryland Women’s Journal, Oct./Nov. 2009.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>About this Project</strong></p>
<p>The goal amount of this campaign is $5,000. At this level, I can distribute between 100 to 300 copies of my currently published print books, and produce and distribute a new edition of my first novel, <em>Identity Crisis</em>, to be released under my own publishing imprint, Renegade Press.</p>
<p>If this campaign succeeds, I’ll not only be able to more effectively distribute books, but I'll be doing so in a way that actually promotes literacy.</p>
<p>If this campaign exceeds the goal, I’ll use the excess funds to distribute even more books, as well as apply the remaining funds toward creating and distributing the fourth novel (in both electronic and print formats) in the series. At that point, I’ll stretch the goal and use the funds to publish and distribute the fourth book in the series. I’ll do this for each successive book in the series and keep contributors updated on my progress, thus extending the series for as long as I can find funding or until I close down the project.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Why I’m Doing This</strong></p>
<p>As a writer, my job is to tell stories. It’s my desire to reach as many readers as possible. However, this project is about more than just me.</p>
<p>By using the Internet, I can not only reach individual readers, but I can efficiently distribute my work to bookstores, libraries, and literary groups or organizations. In this way, I believe all contributors, authors and readers can benefit.</p>
<p>This distribution method is not only more cost-effective and efficient for myself, but it's cheaper for individual readers, when contribution amounts are compared with retail prices plus shipping costs.</p>
<p>Each bookstore, library or group that supports the project will receive books as rewards. From there, they can decide whether to order the book through Ingram or seek more copies (digital or print), which I will gladly arrange to sell, donate or place on consignment, by request. Such arrangements are separate from this project, which primarily aims to distribute books to readers and other interested contributors.</p>
<p>By seeking contributors who make small donations, in exchange for fulfillment of rewards, my work will be distributed, in a way that will cover my costs, provide compensation for the creative and other work that went into this project, and will advance literacy in a meaningful way.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>What You Can Do<br/></strong></p>
<p>Contributions are wonderful, of course. But if you can’t contribute money, you can help by spreading the word, through blogging, social media, email lists and personal contacts. Any and all help here is greatly appreciated, because publicity counts for so much. People can’t contribute to an effort they don’t know about.</p>
<p>So anything you can do to tell others about this helps immensely. Things like tweeting and retweeting about it, posting the information on blogs, Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media sites, emailing it to group lists on which you participate and sharing the information with anyone you know, who might be likewise supportive are all extremely helpful.</p>
<p>You can also make use of Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about this.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>More About Me</strong></p>
<p>I'm currently writing the fourth novel in the series. My short stories have been featured in various anthologies, including <em>Five Uneasy Pieces</em>, <em>Shaken: Stories for Japan</em>, <em>Chesapeake Crimes</em> and <em>Chesapeake Crimes</em>: <em>They Had It Comin’</em>.</p>
<p>In September 2011, I appeared on a Sisters in Crime panel called “Brazen Hussies Speak Out: A Colloquium on Marketing”. The participants included Libby Jordan, Publicity Director of Open Road Media, Gina Panettieri, President of Talcott Notch Literary, and myself. Click on the YouTube video below to see the presentation.</p>
<p>In December 2012, I spoke about self-publishing to the Sisters in Crime, Richmond Chapter.</p>

<p>I'm a contributor to the book <em>Making Story: Twenty-One Writers on How They Plot</em>, edited by Timothy Hallinan.</p>
<p>I’ve also written one feature film script, <em>The Enemy Within</em>, which made the quarter-finals cut in the 2012 Scriptapalooza screenwriting contest.</p>
<p>I’m a member of Sisters in Crime, Mystery Writers of America, Private Eye Writers of America, American Independent Writers, Women in Film and Video, National Writers Union, and Maryland Writers Association.</p>
<p>I’ve appeared on panels at various writers’ conferences, including Malice Domestic, Bouchercon, and AIW’s annual writers’ conference. I’ve also given presentations on self-publishing at the Library of Congress and before the Howard County Chapter of the American Association of University Women.</p>
<p>In November 2004, I suffered a stroke. As a result, I developed dystonia (a rare movement disorder that currently has no cure) in my left hand and foot several months afterward. In May 2009, I held a first-time fundraiser for the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, called the Freedom Ride for Dystonia.</p>
<p>I was a practicing attorney for nine years, before becoming a full-time freelance writer. After I quit practicing law, I earned a Master of Library Science, wrote several novels (some as yet unpublished), and held various part-time jobs while working on freelance assignments.</p>
<p>I’m married to a retired fireman, who also happens to be my best friend. We live in Maryland, with our cats in a house full of books and cat hair.</p>

By using the Internet, I can not only reach individual readers, but I can efficiently distribute my work to bookstores, libraries, and literary groups or organizations. In this way, I believe all contributors, authors and readers can benefit.
This distribution method is not only more cost-effective and efficient for myself, but it's cheaper for individual readers, when contribution amounts are compared with retail prices plus shipping costs.
Each bookstore, library or group that supports the project will receive books as rewards. From there, they can decide whether to order the book through Ingram or seek more copies (digital or print), which I will gladly arrange to sell, donate or place on consignment, by request. Such arrangements are separate from this project, which primarily aims to distribute books to readers and other interested contributors.
By seeking contributors who make small donations, in exchange for fulfillment of rewards, my work will be distributed, in a way that will cover my costs, provide compensation for the creative and other work that went into this project, and will advance literacy in a meaningful way.
What You Can Do
Contributions are wonderful, of course. But if you can’t contribute money, you can help by spreading the word, through blogging, social media, email lists and personal contacts. Any and all help here is greatly appreciated, because publicity counts for so much. People can’t contribute to an effort they don’t know about.
So anything you can do to tell others about this helps immensely. Things like tweeting and retweeting about it, posting the information on blogs, Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media sites, emailing it to group lists on which you participate and sharing the information with anyone you know, who might be likewise supportive are all extremely helpful.
You can also make use of Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about this.
More About Me
I'm currently writing the fourth novel in the series. My short stories have been featured in various anthologies, including Five Uneasy Pieces, Shaken: Stories for Japan, Chesapeake Crimes and Chesapeake Crimes: They Had It Comin’.
In September 2011, I appeared on a Sisters in Crime panel called “Brazen Hussies Speak Out: A Colloquium on Marketing”. The participants included Libby Jordan, Publicity Director of Open Road Media, Gina Panettieri, President of Talcott Notch Literary, and myself. Click on the YouTube video below to see the presentation.
In December 2012, I spoke about self-publishing to the Sisters in Crime, Richmond Chapter.

I'm a contributor to the book Making Story: Twenty-One Writers on How They Plot, edited by Timothy Hallinan.
I’ve also written one feature film script, The Enemy Within, which made the quarter-finals cut in the 2012 Scriptapalooza screenwriting contest.
I’m a member of Sisters in Crime, Mystery Writers of America, Private Eye Writers of America, American Independent Writers, Women in Film and Video, National Writers Union, and Maryland Writers Association.
I’ve appeared on panels at various writers’ conferences, including Malice Domestic, Bouchercon, and AIW’s annual writers’ conference. I’ve also given presentations on self-publishing at the Library of Congress and before the Howard County Chapter of the American Association of University Women.
In November 2004, I suffered a stroke. As a result, I developed dystonia (a rare movement disorder that currently has no cure) in my left hand and foot several months afterward. In May 2009, I held a first-time fundraiser for the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, called the Freedom Ride for Dystonia.
I was a practicing attorney for nine years, before becoming a full-time freelance writer. After I quit practicing law, I earned a Master of Library Science, wrote several novels (some as yet unpublished), and held various part-time jobs while working on freelance assignments.
I’m married to a retired fireman, who also happens to be my best friend. We live in Maryland, with our cats in a house full of books and cat hair.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Please give today. Thank you!</h3>
<h3>Our Why</h3>
<p>We believe we can create a world where there is no more suffering, where we all create peace within and the world reflects our inner peace back to us. We believe today’s generation of children and teens have the potential to become an entire generation of peace leaders, like the Great Peace Leaders of history. Some kids already know they want this.</p>
<p>Our goal is to inspire, guide, and direct the entire generation of today’s youth to become great Peace Leaders.</p>
<p>We see that nearly all children today are suffering in some way. Whether the cause is obesity, autism, bullying, learning difficulties, divorce, peer pressure, or financial worries, nearly every child today suffers. And even those who don’t suffer from any of these things still suffer because they see suffering in the world and they just know the world isn’t as it could and should be. Despite and even because of all this suffering, we know these children can become great peace leaders.</p>
<h3>Our How</h3>
<p>To achieve our goal, we’ve created a Peace Leader training program that will eventually be available to every child, regardless of income, race, cultural or religious background for youth age 8-23 and their parents. Participants in this program through high school and college will have gained extensive experience manifesting their dreams and revealing more Light in the world.</p>
<p>We’re starting in a small and easily achievable way, with a summer Peace Leader Boot Camp near Sedona, Arizona for kids age 8-12. The curriculum and all the business details are already established and negotiated, including rental of classrooms at Desert Star Community School in Cornville, AZ, van rental, salaries, and all necessary insurance. We have a list of kids who want to do the camp and their parents can’t afford tuition. Once we have received enough funding to cover the camp expenses, 24 kids will begin making peace in their own lives and receive effective, experiential Peace Leader training.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camp takes place at Desert Star Community School in Cornville AZ.</li>
<li>The MkP kids recieve special t-shirts and Super Agent identifaction badges.</li>
<li>Each Super Agent will take home a 8x10 camp photo and a hand bound camp scrap book reminding them of their empowering journey and all the lives they've touched!</li>
<li>We provide supportive mentoring at a maximum ratio of 1 adult leader to 8 kids and we've also arranged for Waldorf and Montessori certified teachers and local artists to assist with some projects.</li>
<li>The kids are required to bring their own lunches - we provide snacks, beverages and all other supplies.</li>
</ul><p>Phase two is to launch an expanded extracurricular program in Los Angeles in Fall 2012. The program will continue to be refined and expanded while collaborating with other organizations. Our goal is to help every child to live in their heart, and it will take working with countless established organizations to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>We believe we can absolutely inspire, guide, and direct the entire generation of today’s youth to become great Peace Leaders. When we all work together, anything is possible.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are co-founders Scott McMahan and Jim Allen and together we have over 35 years’ experience improving thousands of kids’ lives. Together, we also have over 30 years’ experience as entrepreneurs owning a great diversity of small and medium businesses.

Ready to cut my losses</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, I sent my first 75 pages to <b><a href=""http://james-mcwilliams.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">James McWilliams</a></b>, professor of history at <b>Texas State University</b>, contributor to the <b><i>The Atlantic</i></b> and <b><i>The New York Times</i></b>, and author of several highly acclaimed books, including </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Just-Food-Where-Locavores-Responsibly/dp/0316033758"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Just Food</a></b></i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. I had met James a year earlier, and after hearing my story, he told me I should write it down and send it to him for review. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So there I was, a year later, nervously waiting for his feedback.

<p>
</p><p>But as honored and pumped as I was, there was <b>a pretty big glitch</b>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You see, despite how incredible the last couple of years have been for <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">me on a physical and emotional level, they sure haven't been good for </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">me <b>financially</b>.

<p>
</p><p>Desperate to stay afloat, I've gone back to working as a bouncer, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">a job that's not only kind of <b>dangerous</b> (how many other jobs get you stabbed in the neck?)</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, but <b>doesn't even pay well</b> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">($50-75/shift) -- which is why I recently had to work <b>15 days in a row</b>.</span></p>

</p><h3><b>HELL YEAH!!!</b></h3><p></p></div>","Ever since I came back from the brink of death and turned my life around, people from all across the globe have been telling me that my story needs to be told. I think it's because after living deep in the trenches for so many years of my life, where I'm at now is nothing short of a miracle.
Eager to get my story out there, in late 2013 I started writing it all down. Three weeks and 75 pages later, it dawned on me I had written nearly half a book! Now, I've been a lot of things in my life: a wrestler, a bouncer, a heavy metal musician, heck even an air conditioning technician, but if there's one thing I never pictured myself as, it was an author. I mean, I barely finished high school!It was time for a reality check. Ready to cut my losses, I sent my first 75 pages to James McWilliams, professor of history at Texas State University, contributor to the The Atlantic and The New York Times, and author of several highly acclaimed books, including Just Food. I had met James a year earlier, and after hearing my story, he told me I should write it down and send it to him for review. 

So there I was, a year later, nervously waiting for his feedback. A few days later my world was turned upside down when I got an email from James telling me that what I had written was not only good, but some of the most moving and powerful material he had ever read! James then went on to tell me that if I was willing to dig deep and finish the book, he was willing to work closely with me to get the book ready to be published! 

But as honored and pumped as I was, there was a pretty big glitch. 

You see, despite how incredible the last couple of years have been for me on a physical and emotional level, they sure haven't been good for me financially. Between work prospects drying up, cars breaking down, and a shit storm of plain old bad luck, I've often had trouble even keeping the utilities on for me and my family.

Desperate to stay afloat, I've gone back to working as a bouncer, a job that's not only kind of dangerous (how many other jobs get you stabbed in the neck?), but doesn't even pay well ($50-75/shift) -- which is why I recently had to work 15 days in a row.
Between working a ton of hours for really low pay, and stressing non-stop about overdue bills, I haven't been able to take advantage of James' amazing offer and get back to work on my book.

Which Is Why I Need Your Help

Thanks to the advice and support of some of my closest friends, I'm launching this campaign so I can focus 100% of my attention on making my book as powerful as possible. All of the funds raised here will:

1) Allow me to work on my book full-time, with James as my guide and editor, and
2) Ensure that everyone who contributes at least $25 gets a copy of my book!

The Perks

As you can see, I've got a lot of awesome, supportive friends who are offering some amazing incentives for people who want to help with my campaign. These friends include The Ultimate Fighter winner James Wilks, world-record-holding strongman Patrik Baboumian, firefighter/ triathlete/author Rip Esselstyn, hip hop artist Stic, researcher/author Dr. Michael Greger, actor/ comedian/author Pat Kilbane, and the folks at Vegan Health and Fitness. I couldn't have launched this campaign without them and hope you'll take advantage of their generosity!

A Little Goes A Long Way

I sure know what it's like to fall on hard times, so please don't feel bad if you can't contribute anything/much. Even sharing this page with friends would mean the world to me!

Thank you for believing in me, my story, and the power to change the world!

It is a narrative built out of an intricate, constantly crisscrossing web of memories of many people. The book never pretends to tell a story. Rather it invites the reader to invent one, out of the memories of those involved. It is set against the backdrop of historical events like Swadeshi movement, Second World War , Partition of India and Communal riots of 1963-64 in Dhaka and Calcutta.</span><br/></span></p>

It gives me great pleasure to let you all know that The Shadow Lines screenplay development project has been shortlisted for NFDC's  Screenwriter's Lab 2012!
This is great news! Thank You all for your support!
Anupam
 
UPDATE (23/07/2012)
Hey all, 
I am very glad to let you know that the sixth draft of The Shadow Lines is now officially registered with the Film Writer's Association of India. 
More news soon..
 
UPDATE (15/06/2012)
Great News!
My good friend Alexander Thomas, screenwriter and film director, joins The Shadow Lines team as co-writer!
 
UPDATE (13/05/2012)
Hey all,
First draft just out of the oven! Excited, scared, relieved, exhausted. I am loving this!
Now to let a few people read it and wait for them reflect on it.
More to follow!
 
 
UPDATE (April 2012)
Hello all!
Just to let you know that we are on the verge of completion of the first draft of the screenplay. We are aiming to have it ready by the end of this month or thereabouts. This will enable us to circulate it amongst close colleagues and get it critiqued by them, and hence devise a plan for further development!
 
More soon....
 
 
I am very glad to announce that we have an option on The Shadow Lines, a novel by critically acclaimed and multiple award winning writer Amitav Ghosh. This option entails that we would have the claim for cinematic adaptation of the book over next one year. In the course of this one year (ending September 2012), we will be working on writing a screenplay based on the novel. This screenplay would then allow us to buy the film rights for the novel at the end of the year.
 
The Shadow Lines by Amitav Ghosh
 
The Shadow Lines (1988), by Indian writer Amitav Ghosh, is a book that captures perspective of time and events, of lines that bring people together and hold them apart, lines that are clearly visible on one perspective and nonexistent on another, lines that exist in the memory of one, and therefore in another's imagination. It is a narrative built out of an intricate, constantly crisscrossing web of memories of many people. The book never pretends to tell a story. Rather it invites the reader to invent one, out of the memories of those involved. It is set against the backdrop of historical events like Swadeshi movement, Second World War , Partition of India and Communal riots of 1963-64 in Dhaka and Calcutta.
 
The Project

 
""....a place doesn't merely exist...it has to be invented in one's imagination....""
 

This line from Amitav Ghosh's Sahitya Akademi award winning novel The Shadow Lines sums up the story of our film project. This film project shall be an exploration of how spaces, memories, imagination connect people across times. It will be a cinematic interpretation and retelling of Ghosh's The Shadow Lines where the protagonist, a young film maker coming to London in 2010 from India, deeply fascinated by Ghosh's book, longs to visit the places vividly described in the book, the places which he has 'invented' in his imagination long before he sets out to look for them. As our protagonist goes deeper in to his search for the spaces from the novel the boundaries between his present, his imagination and Ghosh's fiction start blurring.  
 
Excerpt from my letter to Amitav
 
""..(The Shadow Lines) has been a great literary influence on me and I myself having travelled to London recently for education and work, can identify with the protagonist on so many different levels. The way the book talks about memories, travelling ï¿½ physical as well as imaginary, the way it blends family history with that of a nationï¿½s, and most importantly the ease with which it weaves across the decades, is mesmerising. Being a filmmaker, I have always dreamt of one day getting to adapt this for screen...""
 
Excerpts from Amitav Ghosh's blog
 
""...I went to London for the release of River of Smoke. I met with Anupam during my stay and was enormously impressed by his enthusiasm his encyclopaedic knowledge of film-making. I am glad to announce that we recently signed a contract giving him an option on The Shadow Lines...""

The Impact
 
This project would be the first of its kind to render the literary, visual imagination in Amitav Ghosh's writing to Cinema. Mr. Ghosh has been extremely kind to us by lending audience to our ideas and very instrumental in making this one year option happen. We do not want to let him down in any way.

Given the exchange rate between USD/GBP and Indian Rupees, even a relatively reasonable figure of USD 1500 can help us go a long way over the next year in India. The story in the novel takes place at three locations - Kolkata, Dhaka and London. 
We have absolutely no other funding source for this project. Who will back this film after this first year will depend on how well accomplished the first draft of the screenplay is.
In case we do not reach the intended USD 1500 target, we shall prioritise the expenditure depending on how much we have managed to raise.

Also, during the entire process we promise complete transparency about use of the raised funds and all donors/contributors will receive timely updates on the development of the screenplay.

<p><b>An African Story </b>is a book about the
history of the <b>Gold Coast and Ghana from
1700-1979</b> from the perspective of a single family.  The approach to the history is according to
the Akan oral tradition of PROSOPOGRAPHY. 
Each chapter will recount the story of a direct ancestor in
chronological order of year of birth and place it within the context of the
wider histories occurring on the Coast, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain and
the Americas at the time.</p>
<p>The
history commences in Groningen, the Netherlands and covers the early
interactions of the Europeans and the local populations on the Coast.  It considers the internal politics of the
region taking the reader on a journey through the transatlantic slave trade, its abolishment,
the rise of the intellectual elite, mercantilism, the development of law, the
Wesleyan and Catholic missions and the struggle that eventually led to the
independent state of Ghana in 1957.  It
will end with the presidential elections of 1979.</p><br/><p></p><p>This period in history commences when the transatlantic slave trade was already in full swing.  As such the principle aspect to this history is the impact and aftermath of this dark chapter in global history and the transformation that the Gold Coast underwent to become the proud nation of Ghana that it is today.  The trade had such a significant global impact that its effects are still felt across the world.  In a certain way this history is as much a history of the Gold Coast and Ghana as it is an early study into International Relations from an African perspective.</p><p>While the study of genealogy is only a criteria for subject matter in the book, this history also highlights the diversity that developed through unions between European men and African women.  For several centuries, these Euro-Africans intermarried accumulating in a complex web of ethnic roots that provide an indelible link between Europe, Africa, the United States and in a small part, Far East Asia.  This development also means that there were free Africans in Europe and the Americas who were highly educated and multilingual as well as very mobile.</p><p><br/></p><p>For a researcher there is a limited pool of sources to get funding for such a project.  The easiest path would be to conduct the research as part of a PhD programme.  This path however would restrict the author's autonomy, while at the same time it would limit its audience to academics primarily.  Yet, this story is of interest to many more people.  Anybody interested in history, the slave trade in particular, genealogy, ethnic diversity, social and economic development and international relations will be able to find satisfaction in what this history has to offer.  As such, while the research will be conducted on a scientific basis, the language that will be used will aim to cater to a wider audience.</p><p>The greatest asset to a researcher is time.  Unfortunately, time equals money meaning that all costs incurred while conducting research are applicable.  This means that apart from travel costs and board to the many archives in Europe and Ghana that need to be covered, daily aspects like rent and sustenance are also important.  It is for these reasons that I am seeking crowd-funding as an additional contribution rather than as the only source.  I am currently also looking for contributions from an organisation in Ghana itself as well as a publishing house that will recognise the potential of this story enough to add to this.  I will also continue to add my own contributions.  What I am asking for here is a quarter of the total estimated funds I would require in order to complete the research and write the book over a period of 2 years.</p><p><br/></p><p>So far my research has been funded personally over the past 3 years.  What I have managed to achieve is to identify for 80% the historical characters to research as well as exactly where this research needs to be conducted in order to find more information.  As explained here above, many of the characters included in this book were very mobile.  It means that apart from the national archives in the Netherlands, Ghana and the United Kingdom I will have to conduct research at more local archives in these countries as well as the Basel Mission Archives, the Societe de Missionaires Africaines Archives in Rome and a couple of Archives in Germany (Ulm and Soest in particular).  It is also very likely that archives in Surinam, the Dutch Antilles as well as the United States may have to be consulted.</p><p>There are several assets that I have that qualify me for this research.  First of all, all the characters included will be from my own direct ancestry.  As such it will be a history told from the perspective of a European-born African looking back at the history of his country of origin through the eyes of his own ancestors.  Furthermore, the primary sources from which the information will come from will be in English, Dutch and French.  These are all languages I am fluent in so no additional costs will be incurred there.  For those sources that will be in German - I estimate this to be less than 10% - I will require some assistance.  Finally, my academic background in the political and social sciences provide me with the right scientific skills.</p><p><br/></p><p>It is difficult to estimate the impact of a book on the history of the Gold Coast and Ghana 1700-1979.  However, its history is not limited to its borders as it is the first sub-Saharan country where Europeans landed on the continent.  The transatlantic slavery angle also adds the Americas (the United States, Surinam, the Dutch Antilles and Brasil) to its history, while colonial expansion in the nineteenth century means that Far East Asia (Indonesia in particular) is also included in a small way.  For any resident or national of any of these countries, there will be aspects to their history included that they may not have learned before.  Furthermore, within the context of International Relations anybody will be able to benefit from the lessons that can be learned about ethnic diversity and the impact that the earliest form of capitalism had on the world (transatlantic slavery).</p></div>","Short SummaryI am a Dutch-born Ghanaian political and social scientist with a great passion for history.  I have a BA French (European Studies) from Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London and a MSc Political Science (International Relations) from the University of Amsterdam.  For the past 3 years I have been conducting genealogical research from which this project grew.Each

will end with the presidential elections of 1979.This period in history commences when the transatlantic slave trade was already in full swing.  As such the principle aspect to this history is the impact and aftermath of this dark chapter in global history and the transformation that the Gold Coast underwent to become the proud nation of Ghana that it is today.  The trade had such a significant global impact that its effects are still felt across the world.  In a certain way this history is as much a history of the Gold Coast and Ghana as it is an early study into International Relations from an African perspective.While the study of genealogy is only a criteria for subject matter in the book, this history also highlights the diversity that developed through unions between European men and African women.  For several centuries, these Euro-Africans intermarried accumulating in a complex web of ethnic roots that provide an indelible link between Europe, Africa, the United States and in a small part, Far East Asia.  This development also means that there were free Africans in Europe and the Americas who were highly educated and multilingual as well as very mobile.For a researcher there is a limited pool of sources to get funding for such a project.  The easiest path would be to conduct the research as part of a PhD programme.  This path however would restrict the author's autonomy, while at the same time it would limit its audience to academics primarily.  Yet, this story is of interest to many more people.  Anybody interested in history, the slave trade in particular, genealogy, ethnic diversity, social and economic development and international relations will be able to find satisfaction in what this history has to offer.  As such, while the research will be conducted on a scientific basis, the language that will be used will aim to cater to a wider audience.The greatest asset to a researcher is time.  Unfortunately, time equals money meaning that all costs incurred while conducting research are applicable.  This means that apart from travel costs and board to the many archives in Europe and Ghana that need to be covered, daily aspects like rent and sustenance are also important.  It is for these reasons that I am seeking crowd-funding as an additional contribution rather than as the only source.  I am currently also looking for contributions from an organisation in Ghana itself as well as a publishing house that will recognise the potential of this story enough to add to this.  I will also continue to add my own contributions.  What I am asking for here is a quarter of the total estimated funds I would require in order to complete the research and write the book over a period of 2 years.So far my research has been funded personally over the past 3 years.  What I have managed to achieve is to identify for 80% the historical characters to research as well as exactly where this research needs to be conducted in order to find more information.  As explained here above, many of the characters included in this book were very mobile.  It means that apart from the national archives in the Netherlands, Ghana and the United Kingdom I will have to conduct research at more local archives in these countries as well as the Basel Mission Archives, the Societe de Missionaires Africaines Archives in Rome and a couple of Archives in Germany (Ulm and Soest in particular).  It is also very likely that archives in Surinam, the Dutch Antilles as well as the United States may have to be consulted.There are several assets that I have that qualify me for this research.  First of all, all the characters included will be from my own direct ancestry.  As such it will be a history told from the perspective of a European-born African looking back at the history of his country of origin through the eyes of his own ancestors.  Furthermore, the primary sources from which the information will come from will be in English, Dutch and French.  These are all languages I am fluent in so no additional costs will be incurred there.  For those sources that will be in German - I estimate this to be less than 10% - I will require some assistance.  Finally, my academic background in the political and social sciences provide me with the right scientific skills.It is difficult to estimate the impact of a book on the history of the Gold Coast and Ghana 1700-1979.  However, its history is not limited to its borders as it is the first sub-Saharan country where Europeans landed on the continent.  The transatlantic slavery angle also adds the Americas (the United States, Surinam, the Dutch Antilles and Brasil) to its history, while colonial expansion in the nineteenth century means that Far East Asia (Indonesia in particular) is also included in a small way.  For any resident or national of any of these countries, there will be aspects to their history included that they may not have learned before.  Furthermore, within the context of International Relations anybody will be able to benefit from the lessons that can be learned about ethnic diversity and the impact that the earliest form of capitalism had on the world (transatlantic slavery).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>WOODS - making stories is a new knitting book that we created fueled by our desire to share our passion for local, breed-specific European yarns and modern minimalistic knitwear design.</p>
<p>We've teamed up with amazing designers and European yarn companies as well as a team of wonderful makers on this journey to create a book that shines a spotlight on sustainable, local yarns, celebrates new and established designers, and shares tons of knitting knowledge.</p>
<p>We are Verena Cohrs, knitwear designer and nature lover, and Hanna Lisa Haferkamp, business coach and owner of two handmade labels. We met through the ever-elusive world of Instagram in the beginning of 2016, and immediately bonded over our shared love of natural fibers, supporting small businesses, and grey. </p>
<p>Over the course of the last few months, this has shaped up to be a project beyond our wildest beliefs. We never dreamt of getting as much support, love and encouragement as we did in the last few months from every single one of you. We are thrilled that you are as excited about the book as we are - and we hope you are going to support this next step in making it happen as well! We're going to use the funds from our crowdfunding campaign to get the book printed and compensate everyone involved in the creation of the book fairly and transparently. </p>
<p>We've put together a range of beautiful reward packages for you to help us make that happen. We hope you find something you like and we can't wait until you hold our book baby in your hands.</p>

<p>""Loving the things as no one has thought to love them"" also means for us to learn how to make things you are going to love for a long, long time. Making garments that fit you perfectly, choosing the right techniques and being deliberate and careful in finishing your knitting works are all aspects of knitting that we cherish. Our four long form tutorials are going to help you do all of that!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Size Selection: </strong>We'll show you how to measure your body, what to look for in a pattern when you select the proper size for your knit, and how to adjust a pattern if you fall between two sizes. Yes, there's math involved, but don't worry, it's not scary at all!</li>
<li>
<strong>Cast On &amp; Bind Off: </strong>Selecting the right cast on and bind off method can be daunting - or, in Hanna Lisa's words, it looks a bit like magic sometimes. We'll show you how to decide which method to use so that you can be sure that you'll be happy with your finished knitting!</li>
<li>
<strong>Heel Construction: </strong>Socks are one of our most beloved projects - but there are so many heel options out there that we are totally overwhelmed sometimes. We'll go into when to select which heel construction and show you how exactly to make a heel flap and gusset, a fishlips kiss heel and an afterthought heel so that you get perfect-fitting socks!</li>
<li>
<strong>Seaming &amp; Basting:</strong> You either love seaming or you hate it. We are firmly in the ""love"" corner - and we'd love to convert you, too! This is why we're sharing why and how to seam your finished garment, and go into some useful tips and tricks how to make your knits last longer. </li>

<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>We are SO happy to finally spill the beans - we'll have two amazing makers from the knitting community in interviews in the book! </span></p>
<p><strong>Karen Templer</strong>, who is a force to reckon with in the knitting world since starting her company <a href=""http://www.fringesupplyco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fringe Supply Co.</a> and her blog <a href=""https://fringeassociation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fringe Association</a>, is going to talk about <strong>sweater construction</strong>. Her 2016 <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fringeandfriendskal2016/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#fringeandfriendsKAL</a> inspired tons of knitters to improvise their own sweaters, and we were thrilled at the chance to pick her brain about her favourite ways to construct a sweater, why she fell in love with sweater knitting in the first place, and her biggest making failure to date. </p>
<p><strong>Clare Devine</strong>, the kick-ass woman behind <a href=""https://knitsharelove.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">knitsharelove</a>, is by far one of our favourite sock designers, and given her passion for sharing knitting knowledge, it was a no brainer to ask her if she'd be up for an interview about <strong>sock construction</strong>. We dive deep into the advantages and disadvantages of different construction techniques, her favourite ways of knitting socks and learn about her ideal sock yarn.</p>

<p>Given that a main force of inspiration behind WOODS was the desire to share local, breed-specific, sustainable European yarns, the book wouldn't be complete without a long article about the <strong>history and significance of wool and yarn in Europe</strong> - written by yours truly, Verena and Hanna Lisa.</p>
<p>We didn't want to end there, but also share a glimpse outside the proverbial box and look at what local, breed-specific, sustainable yarn means outside of Europe. We're incredibly happy to have the wonderful <strong>Megan</strong> from <a href=""http://wooldays.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Wool Days</strong></a> share her story of producing a <strong>new, all-Australian-made yarn</strong> and can't wait for you to read all about her journey to her second yarn!</p>

<p>Last, but very certainly not least - we couldn't have done all of this up to this point without you. <strong>This is why we want to celebrate all of you in the book as well! </strong></p>
<p>We'll start this with a very special maker and knitting business owner who shares her #makingstory - <strong>Francoise Danoy</strong> from <strong><a href=""http://arohaknits.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aroha Knits</a></strong>! </p>

<p>We're going to use the funds that we raise to bring it to life with a beautiful printed edition, to fulfill all the rewards, and to fairly compensate everyone involved in the creation of this book!</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what we'll use the funds for:</p>
<p>12.000 EUR Fixed Cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensation for the designers</li>
<li>Professional photography for the book</li>
<li>Graphic design &amp; layouting</li>
<li>Compensation for the crowdfunding videographers</li>

</ul>
<p>To address the elephant in the room - yes, there is no compensation for us in here. Everything up to 30.000 EUR will be used to cover our cost. If we raise more than 30.000 EUR, we might pay ourselves a bit of compensation for making the book happen, but until then, everything goes into compensating our amazing contributors, and getting the book into your hands.</p>
<p>So, what happens in case we don't hit the funding goal? Don't worry - no matter what, you'll get the book. We've come too far to stop now, so we'll work on a different way to finance the difference to the funding goal. That being said - we'd love to make it happen just with your help, so please support us in whatever way, shape or form you can!</p>

<p>We - Verena and Hanna Lisa, the team behind making stories and our first publication WOODS - see ourselves as an independent knitwear design publisher. Our mission is to promote knitwear designers from around the world and environmentally friendly yarn sources, mainly based in Europe.</p>
<p>We deeply believe in a slow living lifestyle and in nature as an emblem and a reminder for Mindfulness. We are, and love to support, small female run businesses who are trans-<br/>parent in their operations. It's extremely important to us to take care of and bolster all members of our team - from the designers to the videographers, from the writers to the layouters. Honesty and kindness are the cornerstones of everything we do.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the two of us, head over to our Instagram feeds (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thewoolclub/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@thewoolclub</a> for Verena and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hannaontheroad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@hannaontheroad</a> for Hanna Lisa), <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/designers/verena-cohrs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Verena's Ravelry page</a> and <a href=""http://www.hannalisahaferkamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hanna Lisa's website</a>. We also share quite a lot about WOODS over on our <a href=""http://www.making-stories.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and our <a href=""http://www.making-stories.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>!</p>

<p>We've done most of the groundwork already - we have amazing designs, super supportive yarn partners, and wonderful makers contributing to the book. </p>
<p>We've selected a photographer, graphic designer and printer that all believe in the project, are local to us in Berlin and excited to get started with their phase of the project. </p>
<p>We've come equipped not only with endless enthusiasm and love for WOODS - making stories, but with a deep knowledge of knitwear design by way of Verena, business acumen by way of Hanna Lisa, and an understanding of the knitting market. </p>
<p>That being said - there's always something that can go wrong. We see the main risks in</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Unforeseen complications with designs.</i> We're knocking on wood, but there might always be an unforeseen problem with a design. To prevent this and to make sure our patterns are at their very best, we're tech editing every single pattern intensely, and have it test knit (a huge thank you to our almost 200 test knitters here!). If changes in the design are necessary to make the pattern work better, we'll do so before the book goes into layout and print. </li>
<li>
<i>Unforeseen complications with yarn companies. </i>Again, crossing all our fingers here, but sometimes unexpected things happen - like a yarn company going out of business which would mean the yarn the pattern was designed wouldn't be available any more at the time of publication. All our patterns can be knit with other yarns, of course, and we've selected extremely reliable yarn partners that have been nothing but amazing so far. </li>
<li>
<i>A delay in printing.</i> As you can see in the timeline above, we've calculated a few months buffer time - the current estimate is that printing the book is going to take 2 to 3 weeks, so we have more than enough time factored in even if something goes wrong with the printer. </li>
<li>
<i>Something happens to one of us. </i>We would never quit the project voluntarily. If something happens to one of us (let's not even think about this, please!), we have contingency plans in place. </li>
</ul>

We've teamed up with amazing designers and European yarn companies as well as a team of wonderful makers on this journey to create a book that shines a spotlight on sustainable, local yarns, celebrates new and established designers, and shares tons of knitting knowledge.
We are Verena Cohrs, knitwear designer and nature lover, and Hanna Lisa Haferkamp, business coach and owner of two handmade labels. We met through the ever-elusive world of Instagram in the beginning of 2016, and immediately bonded over our shared love of natural fibers, supporting small businesses, and grey. 
Over the course of the last few months, this has shaped up to be a project beyond our wildest beliefs. We never dreamt of getting as much support, love and encouragement as we did in the last few months from every single one of you. We are thrilled that you are as excited about the book as we are - and we hope you are going to support this next step in making it happen as well! We're going to use the funds from our crowdfunding campaign to get the book printed and compensate everyone involved in the creation of the book fairly and transparently. 
We've put together a range of beautiful reward packages for you to help us make that happen. We hope you find something you like and we can't wait until you hold our book baby in your hands.
 

We're sure you're as excited as we are about the 11 modern, minimalistic knitwear patterns that we'll have in the book - but there's TONS more content for you! 


The 148 (at least) pages of the book will include

11 modern, minimalistic knitwear patterns by new and established designers from all over the world
11 designer profiles - one per pattern - because we want you to know who the people are that made our gorgeous designs happen! 
 11 yarn company profiles - also one per pattern - to share where the yarn that's been used in the pattern comes from and what makes it so special
4 long form tutorials ranging from cast on to seaming 
2 interviews with forces of nature from the knitting world about their specialty in design 
2 long form articles about local, breed-specific yarns - one focusing on Europe, and one with a very special guest from overseas!
2 spotlights of our making stories community - with a guest article we can't wait to share!

Let's talk details!

We're sure you are super curious to finally see which patterns are going to be included! We'll be sharing sneak peeks of the designs here and over on Instagram (@_makingstories) in the next few weeks, but here's a first overview:


3 sweaters:

A cozy cabled sweater with set in sleeves designed by Paula Pereira (@paulapkl) using Lana Rara (@lanararawool)
A Nordic-inspired colour work yoked sweater designed by Jenn Steingass (@knit.love.wool) using Isle Yarns (@isleyarns)
A gorgeous colour work raglan sweater designed by Orlane Sucche (@tete_beche) using Blacker Yarns (@blackeryarns)

1 vest:
A modern minimalist sleeveless vest designed by Ida Nielsen (@idafwl) using Hey Mama Wolf Yarns (@hey_mama_wolf_yarns)
1 cardigan:
A squishy fishermen's rib cardigan designed by Verena Cohrs (@thewoolclub) using De Rerum Natura (@dererumnatura)
1 tunic dress:
A tunic dress with two different fit options designed by Rhiannon Owens (@rhi.owens) using Sherwood Yarns (@sherwoodyarn)
2 pairs of mittens:

Woods-inspired colour work mittens designed by Claire Walls (@flossiknits) using South Downs Yarns (@louise_sdy)
Ombre mittens with a gorgeous stitch pattern designed by Ruth Werwai (@ruthwerwai) using Black Isle Yarns (@blackisleyarns)

Socks:
A pair of super comfy socks with instructions for 3 heel options - gusset and heel flap heel, a short row heel and an afterthought heel - designed by Linda Dubec (@lindadubec) using Tuku Wool (@tukuwool)
1 hat:
A beautiful textured hat designed by Becky Sørensen (@sopranoknits) using Ovis Et Cetera Yarns (@ovisetcetera)
​1 scarf:
A leave-inspired modern scarf designed by Nele Druyts (@apella.knits) using Moel View Yarns (@moel.view.yarn)
Every pattern will be accompanied by two profiles - one for the designer behind the pattern, and one for the yarn company providing the local European yarn used in the design. We want to celebrate the amazing makers that allow us to create beautiful garments and accessories with two sticks and a bit of twine - and what better way to do that than to let them tell their making story?

""Loving the things as no one has thought to love them"" also means for us to learn how to make things you are going to love for a long, long time. Making garments that fit you perfectly, choosing the right techniques and being deliberate and careful in finishing your knitting works are all aspects of knitting that we cherish. Our four long form tutorials are going to help you do all of that!


Size Selection: We'll show you how to measure your body, what to look for in a pattern when you select the proper size for your knit, and how to adjust a pattern if you fall between two sizes. Yes, there's math involved, but don't worry, it's not scary at all!

Cast On & Bind Off: Selecting the right cast on and bind off method can be daunting - or, in Hanna Lisa's words, it looks a bit like magic sometimes. We'll show you how to decide which method to use so that you can be sure that you'll be happy with your finished knitting!

Heel Construction: Socks are one of our most beloved projects - but there are so many heel options out there that we are totally overwhelmed sometimes. We'll go into when to select which heel construction and show you how exactly to make a heel flap and gusset, a fishlips kiss heel and an afterthought heel so that you get perfect-fitting socks!

Seaming & Basting: You either love seaming or you hate it. We are firmly in the ""love"" corner - and we'd love to convert you, too! This is why we're sharing why and how to seam your finished garment, and go into some useful tips and tricks how to make your knits last longer. 

 

We are SO happy to finally spill the beans - we'll have two amazing makers from the knitting community in interviews in the book! 
Karen Templer, who is a force to reckon with in the knitting world since starting her company Fringe Supply Co. and her blog Fringe Association, is going to talk about sweater construction. Her 2016 #fringeandfriendsKAL inspired tons of knitters to improvise their own sweaters, and we were thrilled at the chance to pick her brain about her favourite ways to construct a sweater, why she fell in love with sweater knitting in the first place, and her biggest making failure to date. 
Clare Devine, the kick-ass woman behind knitsharelove, is by far one of our favourite sock designers, and given her passion for sharing knitting knowledge, it was a no brainer to ask her if she'd be up for an interview about sock construction. We dive deep into the advantages and disadvantages of different construction techniques, her favourite ways of knitting socks and learn about her ideal sock yarn.

Given that a main force of inspiration behind WOODS was the desire to share local, breed-specific, sustainable European yarns, the book wouldn't be complete without a long article about the history and significance of wool and yarn in Europe - written by yours truly, Verena and Hanna Lisa.
We didn't want to end there, but also share a glimpse outside the proverbial box and look at what local, breed-specific, sustainable yarn means outside of Europe. We're incredibly happy to have the wonderful Megan from Wool Days share her story of producing a new, all-Australian-made yarn and can't wait for you to read all about her journey to her second yarn!
 

Last, but very certainly not least - we couldn't have done all of this up to this point without you. This is why we want to celebrate all of you in the book as well! 
We'll start this with a very special maker and knitting business owner who shares her #makingstory - Francoise Danoy from Aroha Knits! 
And then it's over to you - we'll include at least a double page of the Instagram posts that made our hearts jump, our fingertips flutter, and put a big, big smile on our face. If you want to be included, share your making stories pictures using #woodsmakingstories or our weekly prompt hashtag #mymakingstory!
 

The book - as described in all its beauty above - is the core of most of our reward packages. But! There's lots more:

Every backer gets a free copy of the Picos de Europa Hat pattern, exclusively designed for the crowdfunding campaign by Verena Cohrs

If you want to have your full-on WOODS Crowdfunding accessory set, go for one of the packages that also includes the Gascogne Scarf, exclusively designed for the crowdfunding campaign by Solène Le Roux, using beautiful Spanish merino yarn from dlana

To address the elephant in the room - yes, there is no compensation for us in here. Everything up to 30.000 EUR will be used to cover our cost. If we raise more than 30.000 EUR, we might pay ourselves a bit of compensation for making the book happen, but until then, everything goes into compensating our amazing contributors, and getting the book into your hands.
So, what happens in case we don't hit the funding goal? Don't worry - no matter what, you'll get the book. We've come too far to stop now, so we'll work on a different way to finance the difference to the funding goal. That being said - we'd love to make it happen just with your help, so please support us in whatever way, shape or form you can!

We - Verena and Hanna Lisa, the team behind making stories and our first publication WOODS - see ourselves as an independent knitwear design publisher. Our mission is to promote knitwear designers from around the world and environmentally friendly yarn sources, mainly based in Europe.
We deeply believe in a slow living lifestyle and in nature as an emblem and a reminder for Mindfulness. We are, and love to support, small female run businesses who are trans-parent in their operations. It's extremely important to us to take care of and bolster all members of our team - from the designers to the videographers, from the writers to the layouters. Honesty and kindness are the cornerstones of everything we do.
If you want to learn more about the two of us, head over to our Instagram feeds (@thewoolclub for Verena and @hannaontheroad for Hanna Lisa), Verena's Ravelry page and Hanna Lisa's website. We also share quite a lot about WOODS over on our website and our blog!
 


We've done most of the groundwork already - we have amazing designs, super supportive yarn partners, and wonderful makers contributing to the book. 
We've selected a photographer, graphic designer and printer that all believe in the project, are local to us in Berlin and excited to get started with their phase of the project. 
We've come equipped not only with endless enthusiasm and love for WOODS - making stories, but with a deep knowledge of knitwear design by way of Verena, business acumen by way of Hanna Lisa, and an understanding of the knitting market. 
That being said - there's always something that can go wrong. We see the main risks in


Unforeseen complications with designs. We're knocking on wood, but there might always be an unforeseen problem with a design. To prevent this and to make sure our patterns are at their very best, we're tech editing every single pattern intensely, and have it test knit (a huge thank you to our almost 200 test knitters here!). If changes in the design are necessary to make the pattern work better, we'll do so before the book goes into layout and print. 

Unforeseen complications with yarn companies. Again, crossing all our fingers here, but sometimes unexpected things happen - like a yarn company going out of business which would mean the yarn the pattern was designed wouldn't be available any more at the time of publication. All our patterns can be knit with other yarns, of course, and we've selected extremely reliable yarn partners that have been nothing but amazing so far. 

A delay in printing. As you can see in the timeline above, we've calculated a few months buffer time - the current estimate is that printing the book is going to take 2 to 3 weeks, so we have more than enough time factored in even if something goes wrong with the printer. 

Something happens to one of us. We would never quit the project voluntarily. If something happens to one of us (let's not even think about this, please!), we have contingency plans in place. 


 

If you are not a knitter and you're not interested in any of the rewards and we couldn't convince you to give it a try until now, there are still a few ways you can help us!


Donate! If you'd like to support us without claiming a reward, you can do that as well! Simply click on ""Back it"" and you can put in any amount you'd like to donate. 

Spread the love!! We're sure you know at least three people (maybe 4 or 5 or 124?) that you think would be interested in supporting the book. Forward them this website, tell them all about us and ask them to back the project! 

Post about us! On Instagram, on Facebook, on Snapchat, on your website, in the comments of your favourite knitting website, on Reddit - share this page and let people know we exist and we need help. 

Talk about us! If you have a knitting podcast, we'd LOVE it if you talked about the project and shared the love with your followers!

Stock our book. If you'd like to stock WOODS - making stories in your shop, we'd love to talk about it! Please send us an email at hello@making-stories.com.

""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" (Matthew 22:39)
 Who is my NEIGHBOR in the era of mass-incarceration?
When I was young, I remember riding past the walled fortress
of the county jail in our home town. 
Built around the time of the civil war, the castle-like structure
intrigued me.  The iron bars that laced
the huge cathedral style windows served as a reminder of the secure nature of
the building. The foreboding presence of a huge wall capped with razor wire
separated the captive world from the free world and compelled me to wonder what
life was like for the people who temporarily resided there.  My young mind conjured up dark images from
Hollywood of sinister looking people being chained to the walls of a
dungeon. 

                                My name is Patrick Tutella. Having spent thirty-five yers in jail ministry as a correctional chaplain, I am also known as Chaplain Patrick.  



When I entered the correctional chaplaincy as my profession,
I discovered that people behind bars were just that - people.  Some were being held for committing horrible
crimes; other's infractions were less injurious, yet they all were sentenced and
defined as lawbreakers.  The people who
ended up in jail and the people who didn’t surprised me. 


This is Jason Irwin, husband, father, friend and barber extradonaire.  After spending seventeen years in jails and prisons he has emerged from the shadow of the Forty-Foot Wall to a new life as a valued member of the community. His story is one of redemption and hope for people who become lost along the way and need a neighbor to walk with them out of the shadow into a new life.
 


For the last three decades the United States has locked up more of its citizens than any other nation, dubbing this as the era of mass-incarceration.  Little did I know thirty-five years ago when I began working in our county jail, that I would meet friends and neighbors on the inside who I knew in our community. 

This book is a compilation of  twenty four stories of some of the people who I met in jail and the way they impacted my life.  Some of the stories are tragic, others are triumphant;  all of them are true and they remind us of what it means to be human at the deepest plossible level. 

What Respected Leaders are Saying 

“Those behind the 40 foot wall represent some of the most marginalized of society today, and this little book of Chaplain Patrick Tutella so beautifully helps us see Christ’s image in these forgotten and often despised people.”   Rev. Father Luke Veronis, Director, Missions Institute of Orthodox Christianity, Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology,  Brookline, MA

<p>Teaching and working with teenagers has always been very important to me, just as my own teenage years in a slightly different era. I have always loved to explore the vulnerability of this age, let it be mine or others. The stories are mostly fictional, although some of the characters might seem very familiar to the reader: I tried to stick to everyday life situations that could happen to anyone, to anyone's beloved ones.</p>
<p>I am trying to look into these young people's minds, to express their inner thoughts the right and simplest way, let it be about love, drugs, family, adulthood, homosexuality, death.</p>
<p>You will find a short description, readers' opinions and a longer interview (all of them in Hungarian) following the blog's link: <a href=""http://kevertkonyv.blogspot.hu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://kevertkonyv.blogspot.hu/</a></p>You can read one of the short stories, a Budapest Pride contest winner here: <a href=""http://www.muut.hu/?p=13825"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.muut.hu/?p=13825</a><br/><br/>
<p>Unfortunately, as you may also know, it is not the easiest thing to get published nowadays. One can decide to wait till the moment they get noticed, or try to find other ways. I have chosen the latter. Not only for the success (of course I will be the happiest person on earth the second I can see the hard copy of my first published book), but also for the adventure of it. I do believe in contribution, that people around me are eager to help. I have also done it and would always do it for a great cause.</p>

<p>As well as supporting the writing of the book I want to use this experience as a catalyst for professional development in other areas; up-scaling my whole operation.  By the end of the year I want it to be very apparent to my audience just how far their contributions have gone with much more professional looking content available for them to enjoy.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why I have chosen not to try and access public funding.  Personally, I don't like the strings that sometimes come attached to it.  Having put out 17 self-funded musical releases since 2003 as well as founding and running a youth project between 2009 and 2014 - which raised around £20,000 through philanthropy networks - I've learned staying off the grid gives you more options.</p>

a party held to raise money to pay rent by charging guests for attendance (see also ""boogie"")





Rent parties began in Harlem in the 1920s
when cash-strapped Uptown residents devised creative ways to pay discriminatory
rental rates on low salaries. Party hosts opened their homes, and in exchange
for a small cover charge, prepared food and provided live entertainment.
Together, party goers defeated eviction, while eating, drinking, dancing and
socializing for much less than what they’d pay for a night on the town.

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's the Deal?</h3>

<h2 style=""color: #eb9522;"">Why make a site like this?</h2>
<p>Around the globe, our generation is coming to terms with extreme economic and climate crises. In the midst of these crises, we are connecting the online internet buzz of social media with offline action--and doing it better than mainstream media ever could. It’s about time we had our own space; a platform to allow us to speak for ourselves. To one another.</p>
<p>Our generation is sharing information rapidly and the way that we produce our own information is constantly shifting. And so are the power dynamics. Entire movements—from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street—have been catalyzed through the perfect chemistry of face-to-face organizing, branded aesthetics, and social media communication.</p>
<p>It is young people who are the ones at the forefront of these movements while simultaneously deciphering the most effective and efficient strategies to get our stories out to greater audiences. However, there are few platforms that facilitate the ascension of youth into the roles of: strategist, designer, or author. Herein lies the problem: there is no website that is run entirely for youth. And so, we need a home of our own—for us and by us—on the internet.</p>

<strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Who am I? And what are <em>Girls I’ve Run Away With</em> and </strong><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Moonshine Press?</strong>
</h3>
<p>My name is Rhiannon Argo and I have been an avid writer of fiction for 25 years. I embarked on my first book project when I was an 8 yr old with a mullet. I have come a long way since then, not only do I have a more flattering haircut, but I also have a published novel under my belt, <em>The Creamsickle</em>, which won a Lambda Literary Award and was translated into German by a European press. I've been published in many anthologies and magazines, have self-published handmade chapbooks, had a short story inspire a film adaptation, and have toured my work across the United States, Canada and Europe with The Sister Spit Literary Performance Tour (a feminist writing collective) three times. I have read my work from universities in Lincoln, Nebraska, to radical art spaces as far away as Ljubljana, Slovenia!</p>
<p>Recently I finished my second novel, <em>Girl’s I’ve Run Away With</em>, and while seeking a publisher found my prospects to be bleak. The publishing world has been changing rapidly and options for edgy, queer, feminist writers are more limited than ever before. There are only a few small presses that I feel match my works’ aesthetic and they’re so bogged down that I’d have to wait a loooong time for actual publication. I thought, “YOLO! I don’t have that kind of patience!” By that point my books will be stacking up waiting to be dog eared by readers, so I decided to Do-It-Myself. I will launch my own  micro-press called Moonshine Press and <em>Girls I’ve Run Away With</em> will be the first publication.</p>
<p><strong>                           </strong></p>
<p>Moonshine Press will grow to publish other writers of the feminist, queer and trans* persuasion, with a mission to strengthen the power of such voices in the literary world at large. There will be anthologies, and there are fellow writers who are already interested in working on future projects. Why the name Moonshine Press?</p>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<p>1). The moon is associated with rhythms, memories and moods, and is identified with the feminine principle.</p>
<p>2). I was born in a tipi my hippie mom made by hand in a magical place called Moonshine Meadow on Moonshine Road.</p>
<p><strong>                             <img alt=""Tipi"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag143/rhiannonargo/222174_2050507105871_7167949_n_zpsc3e1c349.jpeg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign will procure funding to launch Moonshine Press and publish its debut novel <em>Girls I’ve Run Away With.</em> Let me tell you more about this novel. Written with queer youth readers in mind, I’ve written a novel I wish I could have read in high school, or in my early twenties. The options were seriously lacking when it came to entertaining feminist, or LGBTQ lit, with strong female protagonists. <em>Girls I’ve Run Away</em> <em>With</em> is a fun story of love on the run, but it also touches on heavy topics that are pertinent to the lives of today’s gay youth, such as; coming out, dysfunctional families, being kicked out of your house because you’re gay, the clash of religious beliefs vs. sexual orientation, mental health, suicide of gay teens, notions of queer family, ect, and all of this, while still being an enjoyable read, with a fast-paced plot, and well-drawn characters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><strong>Funding Breakdown &amp; Fun Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Below are my cost estimates based on information I've gleaned from other folks who run small presses, folks that have self published, and professionals who quoted me for various services. So far everyone I am working with is queer community :) </p>
<p>ISBNs: $275 (B<em>ulk is cheaper and can be used for future Moonshine Press works)</em></p>
<p>LLC incorporation: $300 or so</p>
<p>Copy Editor:  $600</p>
<p>Typesetter/Layout: $800-1000 <em>(I still need to hire this person! Is this you?)</em></p>
<p>ARC's: $500 </p>
<p>Website Design: $900</p>
<p>Graphic Designer: $300+</p>
<p>Fundraising fees: $300-500 <em>(This is the % indiegogo and Paypal take)</em></p>
<p>Book printing: $3,000 (Initial print run of 500 books)</p>
<strong>Total: $6,975.00 - 7,375.00 </strong>
<p>* I am asking for less than I actually need with my campaign to make sure I reach my goal. Ideally, I would like to raise more than than the 4,500 asked. The cost estimate above is only how much it will cost to publish only the first Moonshine Press book and not any future books. I was very lucky to get some services for free from awesome friends, such as Amos Mac, who will shoot the cover, and Jaye Fishel, who did free substantive editing. Thanks friends :) Any overage raised, beyond paying people and start-up costs, will go to publicity, touring, and future press publications.</p>

</p>
<p>As a contributor to this campaign you will be investing in numerous things; the career of a hardworking emerging writer, the publication of a novel that will contribute to the LGBTQ literary canon, AND the start up costs of an exciting new micro-press that will expand the publishing opportunities for marginalized writers! </p>

<p>I have an excellent track record so you don’t have to worry about this project not taking off with the force of a bottle rocket! Here are some examples of my artistic and professional follow through:</p>
<ul>
<li>I finished my debut novel, <em>The Creamsickle</em>, when I was only 27.</li>
<li>I currently have one finished novel, its over half done sequel, and a fourth novel in the works. That’s a whole lot of motivated writing, people.  </li>
<li>I have self-published novella length chapbooks, all by hand. IE: taught myself In designt, hand spray painted covers, organized release parties and promo.

My name is Rhiannon Argo and I have been an avid writer of fiction for 25 years. I embarked on my first book project when I was an 8 yr old with a mullet. I have come a long way since then, not only do I have a more flattering haircut, but I also have a published novel under my belt, The Creamsickle, which won a Lambda Literary Award and was translated into German by a European press. I've been published in many anthologies and magazines, have self-published handmade chapbooks, had a short story inspire a film adaptation, and have toured my work across the United States, Canada and Europe with The Sister Spit Literary Performance Tour (a feminist writing collective) three times. I have read my work from universities in Lincoln, Nebraska, to radical art spaces as far away as Ljubljana, Slovenia!
Recently I finished my second novel, Girl’s I’ve Run Away With, and while seeking a publisher found my prospects to be bleak. The publishing world has been changing rapidly and options for edgy, queer, feminist writers are more limited than ever before. There are only a few small presses that I feel match my works’ aesthetic and they’re so bogged down that I’d have to wait a loooong time for actual publication. I thought, “YOLO! I don’t have that kind of patience!” By that point my books will be stacking up waiting to be dog eared by readers, so I decided to Do-It-Myself. I will launch my own  micro-press called Moonshine Press and Girls I’ve Run Away With will be the first publication.
                           
Moonshine Press will grow to publish other writers of the feminist, queer and trans* persuasion, with a mission to strengthen the power of such voices in the literary world at large. There will be anthologies, and there are fellow writers who are already interested in working on future projects. Why the name Moonshine Press?
Two reasons:
1). The moon is associated with rhythms, memories and moods, and is identified with the feminine principle.
2). I was born in a tipi my hippie mom made by hand in a magical place called Moonshine Meadow on Moonshine Road.
                             
This Indiegogo campaign will procure funding to launch Moonshine Press and publish its debut novel Girls I’ve Run Away With. Let me tell you more about this novel. Written with queer youth readers in mind, I’ve written a novel I wish I could have read in high school, or in my early twenties. The options were seriously lacking when it came to entertaining feminist, or LGBTQ lit, with strong female protagonists. Girls I’ve Run Away With is a fun story of love on the run, but it also touches on heavy topics that are pertinent to the lives of today’s gay youth, such as; coming out, dysfunctional families, being kicked out of your house because you’re gay, the clash of religious beliefs vs. sexual orientation, mental health, suicide of gay teens, notions of queer family, ect, and all of this, while still being an enjoyable read, with a fast-paced plot, and well-drawn characters.
 


Funding Breakdown & Fun Perks
Below are my cost estimates based on information I've gleaned from other folks who run small presses, folks that have self published, and professionals who quoted me for various services. So far everyone I am working with is queer community :) 
ISBNs: $275 (Bulk is cheaper and can be used for future Moonshine Press works)
LLC incorporation: $300 or so
Copy Editor:  $600
Typesetter/Layout: $800-1000 (I still need to hire this person! Is this you?)
ARC's: $500 
Website Design: $900
Graphic Designer: $300+
Fundraising fees: $300-500 (This is the % indiegogo and Paypal take)
Book printing: $3,000 (Initial print run of 500 books)
Total: $6,975.00 - 7,375.00 
* I am asking for less than I actually need with my campaign to make sure I reach my goal. Ideally, I would like to raise more than than the 4,500 asked. The cost estimate above is only how much it will cost to publish only the first Moonshine Press book and not any future books. I was very lucky to get some services for free from awesome friends, such as Amos Mac, who will shoot the cover, and Jaye Fishel, who did free substantive editing. Thanks friends :) Any overage raised, beyond paying people and start-up costs, will go to publicity, touring, and future press publications.
 

The Impact of this Campaign!




As a contributor to this campaign you will be investing in numerous things; the career of a hardworking emerging writer, the publication of a novel that will contribute to the LGBTQ literary canon, AND the start up costs of an exciting new micro-press that will expand the publishing opportunities for marginalized writers! 
                         
I have an excellent track record so you don’t have to worry about this project not taking off with the force of a bottle rocket! Here are some examples of my artistic and professional follow through:

I finished my debut novel, The Creamsickle, when I was only 27.
I currently have one finished novel, its over half done sequel, and a fourth novel in the works. That’s a whole lot of motivated writing, people.  
I have self-published novella length chapbooks, all by hand. IE: taught myself In designt, hand spray painted covers, organized release parties and promo. I am experienced in the art of producing and publishing but I have been totally DIY until now. I am asking for help now so I can turn my art into an actual business with the professional quality it deserves!
I have an undergraduate degree in Creative Writing and a master’s degree in Library and Information Sciences. My education informs my knowledge of the publishing industry, literary, marketing and technological skills, and much more.
I have a strong network of friends, and advisors, in the literary and publishing fields that are offering me great support and advice with these projects.

I've invested way more monetarily in my writing than I’ve ever made. It's a labor of love! I've relied on passion, luck, craftiness, and opportunity to fuel my career thus far.

<h2>A New World - book one: First Contact </h2>
<h3>The story</h3>
<p>Set before the formation of the first Egyptian Kingdom, First Contact sets the foundation of the utopian society that Albert, Carrie, Doc and Dorian hope to create.</p>
<p>From the edge of the Sahara, to the delta of the Nile, First Contact will tell of the birth of an empire that would soon rise to challenge both western and southern Europe and even the mighty East.</p>
<p>An empire that would work only to the creation of a new timeline at the end of which humanking would emerge as a better and more advanced civilization.</p>
<p>Can mankind achieve more given better chances and healthier principles or will it just end up destroying itself in some other way? A New World is a 6000-year long scenario of just one answer to that question.</p>
<h3>The author</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am a 30-year old journalist, from Romania, who has been writing creatively for several years, always poking around this project but never quite making it to the point where it would amount to a cohesive concept.</p>
<p>Ever since my early teens I’ve been a passionate science-fiction reader with a special interest for those titles that proposed dystopian futures for mankind, such as Herbert &amp; Ransom’s Void or Simmons’ Hyperion. Faced through literature and cinema with questions regarding the benefits of time-travel I figured that a different approach could be presented if much of early human history could be changed. </p>
<p>It took me several years to reach the point where I had the confidence of being able to picture such an alternative and that is how I started writing this book. I am happy that I have managed to cross the ominous one hundred page step stone and I am very much looking forward to see where this book leads me next.</p>
<h3>Between life and book</h3>
<p>I feel compelled to refrain from calling writing this book my life’s dream, but after beginning a dozen or more projects and seeing how only this one has actually led somewhere I must admit that it is exactly that, my dream project.</p>
<p>Alas, at this stag my dream does not pay for the bills so I am asking for your help to keep writing. Part of the funding will go into covering expenses during the next six months, which is how long I predict will take me to finish the first volume: First Contact.</p>
<p>Another part will go into covering expenses for about a month in London, where I need to undertake the last part of the work on the book; said expenses include fees for such services as editing by a native English speaker, a historical fact-check and other steps I feel are necessary before the manuscript can be submitted to publishing-houses. A smaller amount will be invested into developing the online New World Community.</p>
<h3>Together for A New World</h3>
<p>You might have already noticed that I am not working the usual approach, and I will not use the funding received here to actually publish the book. That is why, as far as perks go, much of the whole system is based on the assumption that donors consider this project worthwhile, where worthwhile means it will actually be picked up by a major publishing-house and become part of the libraries of like-minded people all over the world.</p>
<p>Donating will also make you part of the New World Community about which you can find out more in the perks category.</p>
<h3> Excerpt from Chapter 1 - Tactics </h3>
<p>""We don’t know what’s going on but we have to stay alert. Who knows, maybe the time for First Contact is now”, Dorian said as he was packing his gear.</p>
<p>“I’ll go scout, I’ll be back in ten”, said Carrie and proceeded to go around in order to get a better vantage point.</p>
<p>“Careful, if there are attackers, they might be circling the site themselves”.</p>
<p>The yells didn’t stop, and it became clearer now that they were hearing taunts and protest, but not yet anything that would sound like people getting hurt or dying.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s only a showdown”.</p>
<p>“You really think they do showdowns in this age? Nah, these people get down to it when they do, I’m sure”; Doc grinned, but with an anxious look, he didn’t want conflict either, no matter how ready he would be for it..</p>
<p>Albert was now in full-battle mode, crossbow holstered at his hip and his most fearsome weapon and tool, a harpoon, strapped to his back. Not an usual fishing harpoon it was either. Its hook longer and thinner, yet deadly sharp, it could clear the neck off a foe; if its teeth sank in, no bone or flesh would stay in place when he’d retract that weapon. Over half a meter long, the harpoon had a small grip, like a French duel sword; it helped its owner climb with it too, if necessary.</p>
<p>Dorian was quite distraught when he first saw him use his weapon, not five months after they started their training. Their base had been attacked by Christian zealots. Unprecedented in the history of mankind, both the Roman Pope and the Iranian Ayatollah had dubbed their mission a direct attack at God, and many all over the world sought to destroy what they were working for.</p>
<p>They were awoken at night by the explosion that led the way for a holy commando. None of them were hurt, but several guards died defending the premises before Albert, Doc and Carrie joined the fight.</p>
<p>Dorian was still no fighter, not that he was now, but that night determined him to pay more attention to close-quarters combat and swordplay. Albert slew five zealots before the dreadful attack was over, ripping with his harpoon from victim to victim.</p>
<p>He saved Dorian with one of those kills, beheading a slender albino youth who was cursing at him in Latin while preparing to sink his blade into his chest. He closed his eyes in terror than he heard no more curses, just a helpless growl, as he felt his attacker falling on top of him. When he opened his eyes blood was gushing from a neck that held a head no longer, as Albert was resting his harpoon on the floor to help him out from beneath the dead fanatic. He couldn’t help but look at his head rolled over on the floor meters away; the zealot’s eyes where still open, enough to see the hate frozen in his gaze. That hate was what they were fighting against, he had yet to realize until that night how bloody, gruesome and up-close that fight would be.</p>

<h3>About Eva and Her Book</h3>
<p>Eva recently re-acquired the rights to her historical WWI-era novel, <i>The War in Our Hearts</i>, and she wants to re-release it. It's getting a fresh edit, a new cover, and a new audio version.</p>
<p>Here's what the book is about.</p>
<p><i>France, 1916: Estelle Graham faces a nightmare. Expecting to be met by her beloved husband and their newly-adopted daughter, she instead finds him gravely injured and unconscious in a casualty clearing station. Taking solace in his journals and letters, she fights for his care—and his life.</i></p>
<p><i>In a farmhouse near the Somme, Captain Jamie Graham is forever changed when he meets young Aveline Perrault.

Eva recently re-acquired the rights to her historical WWI-era novel, The War in Our Hearts, and she wants to re-release it. It's getting a fresh edit, a new cover, and a new audio version.
Here's what the book is about.
France, 1916: Estelle Graham faces a nightmare. Expecting to be met by her beloved husband and their newly-adopted daughter, she instead finds him gravely injured and unconscious in a casualty clearing station. Taking solace in his journals and letters, she fights for his care—and his life.
In a farmhouse near the Somme, Captain Jamie Graham is forever changed when he meets young Aveline Perrault. Damaged by the cold, cruel world around them—made even colder by the war—the pair form an unlikely bond. Aveline finds in her capitaine the father she never had, and with her help, Graham faces the pain from his own childhood that even his loving marriage could not heal.
Discover the depth of love and faith in the face of brutality as they learn to live while surviving the Great War.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>I’m Good</i> is a book about living with chronic illness. It highlights stories from my own life, as well as disability influencers, in hopes to guide and inspire those living with chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>My name is Olivia Gaynor and I am the author of <i>I’m Good</i>. I wrote this book because I’ve spent my entire life trying to explain to people what it’s like living with chronic illnesses, but I’ve never gotten the chance to fully explain how these illnesses affect every aspect of my day.</p>
<p>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for disability awareness and advocacy in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn the best ways to help you cope and thrive with chronic illness or if you’re a loved one, the best practices for understanding and interacting with chronically ill people.</p>
<p>In this book, you will learn about a wide range of topics including: </p>
<p><strong>Mental health &amp; chronic illness</strong> - ""Yes, This Part is Invisible Too""</p>
<p><strong>Dating while chronically ill</strong> - ""Love""</p>
<p><strong>Disclosing &amp; explaining diagnoses</strong> - ""Maybe Being Different Isn't good""</p>
<p>You will love this book if you or someone you know is living with chronic or invisible illnesses, or if you're interested in disability overall. </p>
<p><i>I’m Good </i>is a non-fiction book that speaks to chronically ill people and their friends and family who are looking at understanding and coping with chronic illness for the first time.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - I'm Good</h3>
<p>Part 1 contains the background + first 5 chapters. This first section of the book highlights what it’s like to first get your diagnosis. It follows my early years of being sick and gives a lot of background information that will set up the remaining chapters. I talk about the first time I realized that I was different as well as the emotions that come with a big life change.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-9. These chapters show what else comes with being chronically ill, whether it be medications or mental health problems. This section shows how mental health and chronic illness are almost inseparable and equally as important.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 10-17. This section deals a lot which choices. When you’re living with chronic conditions, often, many things are out of your control. These chapters show my own journey of how I’ve dealt with this burden.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 18-21. Here is where I talk about self-advocating and the difficulties that come with being a self-advocate. It’s a struggle to always have to stand up for yourself, and these chapters are where I share this struggle with you. This section also contains the conclusion of the book.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I’m Good is a book about living with chronic illness. It highlights stories from my own life, as well as disability influencers, in hopes to guide and inspire those living with chronic illnesses.
My name is Olivia Gaynor and I am the author of I’m Good. I wrote this book because I’ve spent my entire life trying to explain to people what it’s like living with chronic illnesses, but I’ve never gotten the chance to fully explain how these illnesses affect every aspect of my day.
In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for disability awareness and advocacy in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn the best ways to help you cope and thrive with chronic illness or if you’re a loved one, the best practices for understanding and interacting with chronically ill people.
In this book, you will learn about a wide range of topics including: 
Mental health & chronic illness - ""Yes, This Part is Invisible Too""
Dating while chronically ill - ""Love""
Disclosing & explaining diagnoses - ""Maybe Being Different Isn't good""
You will love this book if you or someone you know is living with chronic or invisible illnesses, or if you're interested in disability overall. 
I’m Good is a non-fiction book that speaks to chronically ill people and their friends and family who are looking at understanding and coping with chronic illness for the first time.
 
The Book - I'm Good
Part 1 contains the background + first 5 chapters. This first section of the book highlights what it’s like to first get your diagnosis. It follows my early years of being sick and gives a lot of background information that will set up the remaining chapters. I talk about the first time I realized that I was different as well as the emotions that come with a big life change.Part 2 contains Chapters 6-9. These chapters show what else comes with being chronically ill, whether it be medications or mental health problems. This section shows how mental health and chronic illness are almost inseparable and equally as important.Part 3 contains Chapters 10-17. This section deals a lot which choices. When you’re living with chronic conditions, often, many things are out of your control. These chapters show my own journey of how I’ve dealt with this burden.Part 4 contains Chapters 18-21. Here is where I talk about self-advocating and the difficulties that come with being a self-advocate. It’s a struggle to always have to stand up for yourself, and these chapters are where I share this struggle with you. This section also contains the conclusion of the book.

<h3>Greetings :)</h3>
<p>Thanks for stopping by to see what's the deal here ;) I'm working on my second poetry collection: 'RHYME &amp; REASON: Facets of a Life', &amp; I need a little help to maximise my distribution potential.</p>
<p>I am a British writer/poet/screenwriter/actor/director/film maker living in Chicago. I have predominantly been making no budget Indie Horror films for the last ten years under my company name, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BloodyBritProductions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Bloody Brit Productions'</a>, but decided to branch out last year &amp; finally publish some of my poetry. My style is very old school; I was raised on rhyming verse &amp; the fun, twisted children's poems of Roald Dahl. In my late teens/early twenties, I formed a rock band &amp; wrote lyrics, [I sang]. As I have matured, so has my writing. I am still very much drawn to rhyme, though I am experimenting a bit more with poetic forms &amp; structure while keeping a lyrical flow.</p>
<p>My first book, '<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lovebleedspoetry/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LOVE is a KILLER</a>', is a horror themed collection about heartbreak, psychos &amp; classic monsters. I self published via Amazon, but mostly sold in person at events. I've had great feedback on this book:</p>
<p><i>""I enjoy the talent Claire shows in her poetry and the way she has designed her book. I hope she keeps on writing. Poetry, scripts, fiction books.""</i></p>
<p><i>""Amazingly macabre poetry! The prose was on point and incredibly well written. I enjoyed it immensely!""</i></p>
<p><i><i>""Accessible, relatable, 'Everyman's' poetry. Not for poetry snobs.""</i></i></p>
<p>This has encouraged me to continue publishing. However, I have exhausted my closest network for sales &amp; need to expand my reach by investing in good marketing, hence this campaign.</p>
<h3>The New Book</h3>
<p>'RHYME &amp; REASON: Facets of a Life', is a more personal exploration of life in the poetic form. It is split into three categories: 'LIFE', 'LOVE', &amp; 'LAUGHTER', &amp; it expresses a wide range of emotions &amp; situations.</p>
<p>I was reticent at first to publish some of these poems as they may be construed as being negative. However, it can be very cathartic when someone else describes feelings you have had, you know you are not alone, &amp; it was rewarding for me when readers of my first book related to some of my poems. But it's not all doom &amp; gloom, there are some empowering messages thrown in, &amp; of course my humorous, if not twisted, story poems. </p>
<p>This book will be longer than the first, which is 52 total pages, [technically longer than a chapbook but still a quick read]. However, it will be less than 100 pages, [still currently in writing phase so cannot give final page count]. [Cover art is still in the works.]</p>
<h3>The Next Step</h3>
<p>Why do I need money to self publish?</p>
<p>The simple answer is: more coverage.</p>
<p>By using a free ISBN from Amazon or the like, as I did with my first book, that limits distribution channels &amp; is deemed by some as unprofessional. For example: Barnes &amp; Nobel &amp; libraries do not carry such titles. Those outlets also require an ISBN for ebooks. I would like to re-publish my first book, in both formats, using a personal ISBN as well as assigning one immediately to my new book.</p>
<h3>What do I need?</h3>

<li>Personal ISBN numbers, barcodes &amp; copyright registration.</li>
<li>Membership to Alliance of Independent Authors &amp; Independent Book Publishers Association. They both offer valuable educational tools &amp; discounts on resources.</li>

</div></div>","The Setup
I'm a smart, educated guy who has been as successful in his mid-career job search as Mel Gibson has been at sensitivity.
So, in order to not go thoroughly broke and move back in with my increasingly hard-of-hearing and gassy parents, I realized that I have to rely on my narrow set of talents - writing, humor, cooking, and drinking. What? How is drinking a talent? That's my business.
About a year ago, I invented a crude, crass, and socially apathetic cartoon character named Bastard Squirrel. I even paid a local artist to draw a kind of anthropomorphized dirtbag rodent.
The thoughts expressed in these two paragraphs were largely unrelated until now. I think that Bastard Squirrel might be an interesting brand - in the same way that pain from too much wasabi is kind of good - I don't even know what that means, but both statements are true.
I want to launch a series of books under the Bastard Squirrel (BSq) umbrella. Of course one must start their proverbial day with one. If you start your proverbial day with two, then you should not have eaten such a big meal right before you went to sleep.

Then there's the printing of a small run of actual books. While Kindle and e-publishing are intended to be most common means to obtain this future prize winner, it's nice to have a few books for awareness, promotions, and a place to re-home losing scratch off tickets as bookmarks.
Plus, there's a little marketing to be done before it blows up on the internet and becomes the Susan Boyle of, well... boiling.
The following is my estimates for these goodies:

Illustrator: $1,000
Printing - $1,000
Marketing - $1,000
 
I set the goal at $2999 - I'll cover the extra buck. In addition to my considerable financial contribution, I've done all the research writing, and am waiting on the editing (I'll get someone to review, but cheap - from a highly literate friend).
If I do not meet the goal, I can spin down the print run (it's at 333 now), and reduce the marketing. A lot of the marketing was expected to be via social media - and those campaigns can achieve a lot on the cheap - I'm just preparing for a consistent campaign delivered for 90 consecutive days in order to be cohesive and with the best chance of delivering a successful message.
â€¨
The Knockdown
Okay, is the project noble - not really. Is it better than helping a sick person - nah, unless the sick person is an a-hole. Will a Bastard Squirrel cookbook save the world from aliens - yes, yes it will.
The project is valuable to me because it allows me to work on my small dreams while the bigger ones, the ones I trained for, are working themselves out.
The project is valuable because it will probably make you laugh and it might make you into a deceptively good cook. Even if you are already a good cook, you'll still try out one of these heavily researched (really) recipes.
The project is valuable because even if you are a humorless, joyless, Spaghetti-Os eating troglodyte, you can still use the book as a weapon. If you throw Catcher in the Rye at somebody, they'll think there's symbolism in your action - like ""read a book and BE someone!"" If you throw the Bastard Squirrel Cookbook at the same person, they'll know you're just pissed.
You can trust my integrity because I take all challenges and support seriously. I am intelligent, highly motivated, and have the skills to get the book done and done well. I live by the motto ""It's taken me a long time to get to the bottom, and I'm not stopping here.""

Even if you can't help financially, just letting someone else know that such hilarious practicality is soon to exist – with the help of you potent social circle – is a huge message and favor. An even huger message and favor is dough, but again, we'll take a mention to your friends. In closing, dough.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Le trésor de La Buse </h3>
<div>ENGLISH BELOW</div>
<p>Réunionnais d'origine, je vis à saint denis de la Réunion, j'ai 34 ans, marié et père de deux garçons.</p>
<p>Salarié dans une grande entreprise de l'île (une banque, pas très passionant comme métier), je me suis pris de passion pour les histoires de pirates, leurs trésors, et plus particulèrement celui d'Olivier Levasseur dit ""La Buse"".</p>
<p>Enterré quelque part sur une île de l'océan indien en 1721, ce butin vient du pillage du ""Nossa Senhroa do Cabo"", navire amiral de la flotte portugaise, ammaré au large de saint denis de la Réunion.

ENGLISH BELOW
Réunionnais d'origine, je vis à saint denis de la Réunion, j'ai 34 ans, marié et père de deux garçons.
Salarié dans une grande entreprise de l'île (une banque, pas très passionant comme métier), je me suis pris de passion pour les histoires de pirates, leurs trésors, et plus particulèrement celui d'Olivier Levasseur dit ""La Buse"".
Enterré quelque part sur une île de l'océan indien en 1721, ce butin vient du pillage du ""Nossa Senhroa do Cabo"", navire amiral de la flotte portugaise, ammaré au large de saint denis de la Réunion. On parle de 5 tonneaux de pièces d'or, d'une cassette de diamants et de lingots d'or, mais principalement de la croix de Goa. 
De nombreux chercheurs de trésor se sont cassés les dents en le recherchant, certains y ont passé leur vie, d'autres se sont suicidés (Bibique 1995).

The
treasure of the Tube
From
Reunion Island, I live in saint denis Reunion, I'm 34, married and father of
two boys.
Employee in
a large company of the island (a bank, not very exciting), I developed a
passion for the stories of pirates, their treasures, specially the one of
Olivier Levasseur ""La Buse"".
Buried
somewhere on an island in the Indian Ocean in 1721, it comes from the pillaging
of booty ""Nossa Senhroa do Cabo ', flagship of the Portuguese fleet, docked
in Saint Denis Reunion. We talk about 5 barrels of gold, a safe of diamonds and
gold bars, but mainly the gold cross of Goa.
Many
treasure hunters have broken their teeth by searching, some spent their lives,
others committed suicide (Bibique 1995). The search has been boosted in 2014
with the work of Mezino on the cryptogram of la Buse: document that the pirate
threw to the crowd at the bottom of the scaffold on which he was hanged in
1730, and indicates the location of his treasure.
It is, today,
sure the treasure is on Reunion Island.
I made a
new translation of the cryptogram, whose language is a mixture of old French,
Occitan, Provencal old and old Creole. The text represents a sequence of
navigation elements based on the constellations visible in the southern
hemisphere and bringing the Reunion Island (22 ° S, 55.3 ° E).
Work on the
willingly  added points on the cryptogram
serve to highlight a map, in connection with the famous words of la Buse on the

<p>This 72 card oracle deck was created to focus on a nature-based and healing theme. Once the manual is created, it will contain definitions on how to use the cards to not only give a general oracle reading, but to read the collective energy as well. Some samples of the cards are below:</p>

<p>The cards are divided into suits with 8 cards in each suit. The suits are air, earth, fire, ice, water, purification, spiritual hygiene, healing, and technology. The images for the cards were extended licenses purchased through Fotolia and Dreamstime.<br/> </p>

<p>Some of the qualities of this oracle deck might be hard to find in a regular angel card, tarot, or oracle deck, For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>This oracle deck has 9 suits of 8 cards each creating a deck of 72 cards</li>
<li>The suits are earth, fire, water, air, ice (to cover various environmental situations) and healing, purification, technology, and spiritual hygiene (to cover other important aspects of he world that affect our personal and collective health and well-being).</li>
<li>This oracle deck will allow those using it to read the collective energy rather than simply focusing on their personal life alone. This helps with seeing the bigger picture and the impact being made or what steps we can take to be part of healing the collective energy.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

Thanks to Jennifer Ball who does a good job at describing how to use the card fronts with the card backs.
 

With the newly printed cards in, this deck has also been unpublished from makeplayingcards.com . 

This 72 card oracle deck was created to focus on a nature-based and healing theme. Once the manual is created, it will contain definitions on how to use the cards to not only give a general oracle reading, but to read the collective energy as well. Some samples of the cards are below:


The cards are divided into suits with 8 cards in each suit. The suits are air, earth, fire, ice, water, purification, spiritual hygiene, healing, and technology. The images for the cards were extended licenses purchased through Fotolia and Dreamstime. 

The cards are currently available online through a divination website application. 
 


***Note: I've made a few changes since doing the first print run due to learning more about environmental options available, quality, guilding and other factors. ***
The book I'm now having printed through Ingram Spark (an environmental print-on-demand service). The box is created out of recycled paperboard.

 


Some of the qualities of this oracle deck might be hard to find in a regular angel card, tarot, or oracle deck, For example:

This oracle deck has 9 suits of 8 cards each creating a deck of 72 cards
The suits are earth, fire, water, air, ice (to cover various environmental situations) and healing, purification, technology, and spiritual hygiene (to cover other important aspects of he world that affect our personal and collective health and well-being).
This oracle deck will allow those using it to read the collective energy rather than simply focusing on their personal life alone. This helps with seeing the bigger picture and the impact being made or what steps we can take to be part of healing the collective energy.

82 year old author, grandmother and victim of the credit crunch Anne J. Steinberg has written eight novels and her dream is to publish all of them online. <br/><br/>Her first novel ""Manroot"" was listed for the prize ""Fiction Without Frontiers"" with six other prestigious authors including Margaret Atwood. ""Manroot"" is about a Native American healer and was recently 
published on Amazon as an e-book. The novel has over 59 - 5 star reviews and 33 - four star 
reviews. Reviewers wrote ""I wish it would have lasted longer and was 
saddened when it came to an end. 5 Stars and cannot wait to see what 
Author Anne J. Steinberg comes up with next!"" <br/><br/>In 2008 Anne lost most of her money in the stock market disaster and fell on some hard times. It has been her lifelong dream to be able to publish all of her novels online. So far she has published five of them on Amazon and wants to publish the other three as well. <br/><br/>But Anne doesn't have the funds to publish these three novels because they still need to be typed out and formatted. She is looking to raise funds to pay for a typist to type her books and a graphic artist to design the covers. She also would like to buy a computer with voice recognition software so she can begin working on some new novels she plans on writing as well as turning her novels ""Manroot"" and ""Cuckoo's Gift"" into screenplays. <br/><br/>It is her dream for the world be able to read her books but at 82, in a technological age - it has become very difficult to achieve this.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Anne is looking to raise $10,000 to achieve her dream of releasing all her books into the world. She plans to spend the money in the following ways;

<p>$2000 - for three new covers designed for her novels by a graphic artist.</p>
<p>$2500 - will go to buying a new Apple computer with voice activated typing so she can continue to write new novels. This would also include a new printer. <br/></p>
<p>$3000 - will go to advertising and publicizing all of the eight novels online such as through Book Bub, Kindle Nation and Goodreads. It will also go towards getting the book on other platforms. <br/></p>
<p>$500 - go to entry fees for various legitimate book and screenplay competitions like The Nicholl Fellowship and Final Draft. These funds will also go to purchasing screenwriting software. <br/></p>
<p></p>We have several unique perks for the campaign. A $5 contribution will allow you to get a free e-book PDF of Anne J.

She has faced great challenges in her life including losing a lot of her money in the stock market crash and having setbacks with her career.

The pen-feel provided by the guiding wheels offers unparalleled control of your writing tool.  Press lightly down and the wheels will guide your pen to create more uniform and symmetrical lines. When you give equal pressure to both wheels, you can easily draw a perfect STRAIGHT LINE, both vertical or horizontal. If you give varying pressure to the wheels, they will guide you in drawing a CURVED LINE. Find the perfect line with Straight pen.    With any pen, control is paramount. With Straight Pen, not only can you control the direction of the line, you can also control where the line starts and stops. The pen lead within Straight Pen is spring loaded allowing the user to stop marking by simply releasing  pressure on the pen. Slips of the hand won't leave stray marks because without steady pressure the spring will automatically recoil the pen lead back upwards.  The wheel guides on Straight Pen are set at a negative camber for maximum contact with the surface, thereby allowing for more grip feel or control. The same concept is applied to race cars, where a negative camber sacrifices straight line acceleration for more control on turns. This wheel alignment provides more pen-feel or feedback, which allows you to feel the movements of Straight Pen with more sensitivity.Whether drawing straight or curved, feel the line with Straight Pen!   StudyingAs a student, keeping your thoughts and notes organized are the first step to effective studying. When drawing diagrams, graphs or charts, Straight Pen can help you create more symmetrical and precise designs. Straight Pen also covers your highlighting needs with neat lines to catch your attention when you return to reading material. Develop effective study habits with Straight Pen. Drawing & MappingFor those who draw, including interior designers and architects, Straight Pen offers straight lines without rulers.  Whether mapping out the interior of a house, drawing a straight line to mark the placement of nails, or using line shading to give your drawings perspective, Straight Pen provides the guidelines to a more organized and impactful drawing.  PlayThen, there are those of us who love to doodle & play. Millions of games can be played with just pen and paper. Whether engaging in a game of Tic-tac-toe, Hangman or Boxes Straight Pen can provide hours of fun.    The Straight Pen offers all standard pen colors. The writing side of Straight Pen comes in Black ink. The line drawing side of Straight Pen is available in Red, Blue and Black.        Straight Pen Standard  - 1 Straight Pen (Plastic Body) Straight Pen Premium - Packaging + Tutorial + Ink Refill + 1 Straight Pen (Silicon Plastic Body)      LAINOVA stands for Line + Innovation + Value. We at LAINOVA believe that to change the world, you must start with the right tools. Our hope is that small changes towards making life more effective can help you unlock your dreams, whatever they may be.",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Robert Tomoguchi and I began writing when I was 13 years old. Over the years I've written many poems, stage plays, screenplays, a fairytale, and four novellas. It has always been my goal to become a novelist and after two years of relentless work, I finally finished writing my first full length novel and plan to release it by early December 2016. </p>
<p>I created this campaign in order to pre-sell the book to raise money to help cover the costs of publication and promotion. This includes typesetting, book design, cover design, and promotion. </p>
<p>I'm hoping this book might help launch a professional career for me as a writer, so that I can devote all my time creating new stories. My favorite thing about my pre-sale is that contributors will be able to read this book that I am so proud of. </p>
<h3>What is the Book About?</h3>
<p>The Scribbled Victims tells the story of Yelena Solodnikova, a vampire who developed a conscience, and therefore struggles with the guilt of her murderous eternal existence. She finds solace in the company of Orly Bialek, a twelve-year-old girl who is dying of cancer. Through her art, Orly can see the evil deeds committed by the people she scribbles. These scribbles provide Yelena with victims she will not feel guilty for killing. It seems like a perfect relationship, except that Orly’s cancer will soon take her life. Yelena must decide between letting Orly die and returning to her own eternity of guilt, or making her immortal by condemning her to the loveless life of a child vampire.</p>
<p>Yes, my debut novel is a vampire novel, but this book is much more than that. It is about different kinds of love and the bonds that form between people. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I created a spreadsheet that added up the costs of book publication and promotion and it came to $2,261.20.</li>
<li>The money contributed will go towards production and publication costs including: typesetting, book design, and cover design. It will also help promote the book by launching a brand new website for the book, and to pay the fees to three companies who will help promote the book to their audience, reviewers, and libraries.  </li>
<li>Contributors to my campaign will be able to read the book in either paperback or in eBook format, but they will also have their name published in the Acknowledgements section at the end of the book so that their generosity and support will always be recognized. </li>
<li>If my goal is not achieved then whatever funds raised will go first to the production and publication of the book so that all contributors will be guaranteed a copy. If the entire goal is not reached then it will result in less or delayed book promotion. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will not only help me further my goal of becoming a full time writer, but it will also help circulate a new novel that I am certain readers will enjoy and even make non-readers excited about reading. </p>
<p>I have done two successful pre-sales before to promote my last two novellas in the Me and My Friend Maddie Gothic Book Series, and the assistance was invaluable. Both books were well received by readers. But this book is more than twice the length of those books and will appeal to a much wider audience.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No donation amount is too small but if you want to support the book and are unable to make a monetary contribution you can still help by sharing this campaign and telling others about the book which will come out by early December. You can even use the IndieGoGo share tools!</p>

</div></div>","Who am I?Hi, I am Annemiek Steur, I am 18 years old, I am Dutch and I am a published fantasy author.When I was 15 years old I realised my big dream, by publishing my first book Vitya Malonti in Dutch. I love fantasy and I love writing and my current big dream is to have my two books published in English.

Why?I realize that my generation of teenagers and young adults are growing up in a world of endless opportunities. That is why I intend to live my life to the fullest and to fulfill my greatest potential. I believe that everyone deserves the chance to escape reality for a while, and enter the world of fantasy whenever they wish. This is why I publish my books, inviting you to enter the fantasy world of Jonas Dubelaar, the 11 year old boy who is the main character in my book series.More importantly, I truly hope to inspire and empower many other children and youngsters to go after their dreams, to never give up and, in turn, to inspire their next generation.
My milestonesAt the age of 10, I started writing stories for my little brother and sister, to entertain them during long car trips. When I was thirteen I first started the idea of writing a real book and turning fantasy writing into my passion. In 2011, when I was just 15, I went to the Business Bootcamp and met Nisandeh Neta. This is change my life, made me set up my own fantasy business and this video shows what happened when I presented Nisandeh Neta with my first published book.
Why do I need your help?To have a bigger impact and to be able to inspire other children and teenagers to chase their biggest dreams, is my reason for starting this campaign.  I cannot do this by myself, so I really need your help.You can help me make more impact by supporting me in producing and
publishing my books in English. Help me to reach, please and enchant all those
millions of English fantasy readers, who I will never be able to reach with my books
in Dutch.
How can you help?
By contributing to this campaign you become my fantasy partner in sharing my stories and inspiring others. To thank you I created six special fantasy gifts for you. You can choose the one that you like the most.

<p>There is no ""hard"" deadline on the book's release but I have a personal deadline of May 1st being the first week the book is available everywhere. I don't want you guys waiting forever on the release.</p>

Through everything he gives voice to our own unspoken feelings, and does so with delicate yet powerful language. These poems are a constant source of wisdom and grace.

<br/><br/><br/><h2>A Campaign of Many Voices<br/>
</h2>
<br/>Why is an award-winning poet with a Stanford MA and unimpeachable credentials publishing with a small press, and using IndieGoGo to fund production? While many publishing houses would happily produce his new manuscript, Francisco chose <a href=""http://www.poeticmatrix.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Poetic Matrix Press</b></a> – a small, independent press with roots in the Sierra Nevada and the Central Valley. We have always published books that reflect the diverse voices of California and beyond, and which help bring the full richness of life into focus. The advent of crowdfunding platforms has allowed us to go a step further – we can directly address the people of our community and society to help spread their voices through our books. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/731951/files/20140721000134-AlarconReading2flipped.jpg?1405926094"" src="""" style=""width: 492.79px; height: 471px;""/></p><br/><i><b>Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras</b></i> is a book of poetry, but it is also a declaration of unity with the earth – and with all the varied cultures, languages, and beliefs that interweave to create the unimaginable vastness of our lives. It arose out of poems written for <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PoetryOfResistance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Poets Responding to SB 1070</a>, a Facebook community started by Francisco which stands in opposition to a racist, dehumanizing law in Arizona aimed at undocumented migrants. Now every day thousands of people share poetry, videos, and articles of resistance.<br/><br/><b> We would like to invite you to add your voice</b> by donating to our campaign and sharing these poems with your friends and family – <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Poetic-Matrix-Press/325686277526807"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on Facebook</a>, over email, on the phone, wherever.  Ask them to join you in helping us publish a poetic vision of a world without borders.

We need your help.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Directly from the Poet</h2><br/>Supporters who donate to produce this book will be thanked by name in the final book, and also on the book's page on our website. We are also offering a small number of very special perks to our donors at various levels.<br/><br/><ul>

</li>
<li>At <b>$25</b> you will receive one of the first printed copies of <b><i>Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras</i> </b>delivered to you directly. We estimate a shipping date somewhere in mid-autumn of 2014.</li>
<li>With <b>$40</b> of support your copy of the book will be <b>signed, dated, and numbered</b> by Francisco himself. This is an opportunity to own one of only a handful of special campaign-designated copies.</li>
<li>A donation of <b>$50</b> gets you an early-access e-book as well as a signed copy of Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras.</li>
<li>We are offering something very special for a <b>$100</b> donation. You may choose one of the 4 haikus below (which open each of the 4 sections of the book) to be <b>handwritten by Francisco</b> on fine art paper, dated, and signed. You will also receive everything at the $50 level of support. This is a rare opportunity to receive a unique and very personal piece of art directly from the poet himself. Only 10 of each poem available!</li>
<li>Finally, if you are able to support us with a gift of <b>$400</b> you will receive all four of the poems below, as well as the haiku Francisco is using to close his manuscript.

A Poet Without Borders
The current crisis of unaccompanied child refugees from Central America is part of a familiar history – the continual unwillingness of people of the Americas to stay within and behind the borders drawn between them. The upcoming title from Poetic Matrix Press, Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras, is a book of poems for the earth and the people, crafted by a poet at the peak of his power. It speaks to the porousness of our boundaries, and the futility of all attempts to separate people and regions so intimately intertwined. Francisco X. Alarcón is a man who, like the monarch butterfly he eulogizes, lives in and migrates between many worlds. From Los Angeles to Guadalajara, from the Mission barrio in San Francisco to Stanford and UC Davis, Francisco has lived fully immersed in the diverse cultural landscape of California and Mexico. Part of a small but remarkable group of gay Chicano poets, his language is lean and brief; his poems puncture the skin and pierce the heart.This is a work of rare beauty and intelligence. Through tierra, fuego, agua, and aire Francisco takes us on a journey into our own psyche and through the concerns of our world –  immigration and identity, the fragility and strength of our natural environment, the many faces of love, and the politics of a world in great need of illumination. Through everything he gives voice to our own unspoken feelings, and does so with delicate yet powerful language. These poems are a constant source of wisdom and grace.

A Campaign of Many Voices

Why is an award-winning poet with a Stanford MA and unimpeachable credentials publishing with a small press, and using IndieGoGo to fund production? While many publishing houses would happily produce his new manuscript, Francisco chose Poetic Matrix Press – a small, independent press with roots in the Sierra Nevada and the Central Valley. We have always published books that reflect the diverse voices of California and beyond, and which help bring the full richness of life into focus. The advent of crowdfunding platforms has allowed us to go a step further – we can directly address the people of our community and society to help spread their voices through our books. Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras is a book of poetry, but it is also a declaration of unity with the earth – and with all the varied cultures, languages, and beliefs that interweave to create the unimaginable vastness of our lives. It arose out of poems written for Poets Responding to SB 1070, a Facebook community started by Francisco which stands in opposition to a racist, dehumanizing law in Arizona aimed at undocumented migrants. Now every day thousands of people share poetry, videos, and articles of resistance. We would like to invite you to add your voice by donating to our campaign and sharing these poems with your friends and family – on Facebook, over email, on the phone, wherever.  Ask them to join you in helping us publish a poetic vision of a world without borders. This book cannot be produced without the direct support of you, our friends and community. Join us to celebrate the monarch butterfly, the desert, the children of Guatemala and El Salvador, and our shared, indivisible humanity. We need your help.Directly from the PoetSupporters who donate to produce this book will be thanked by name in the final book, and also on the book's page on our website. We are also offering a small number of very special perks to our donors at various levels.
A $5 donation comes with our thanks, online and in print. We truly appreciate donations at any level.

For support of $15 you will receive an e-book of Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras in .pdf format, suitable for Kindle, iPad, and other tablets. This will be available as soon as the manuscript is fully laid out, edited, and proofed. 

At $25 you will receive one of the first printed copies of Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras delivered to you directly. We estimate a shipping date somewhere in mid-autumn of 2014.
With $40 of support your copy of the book will be signed, dated, and numbered by Francisco himself. This is an opportunity to own one of only a handful of special campaign-designated copies.
A donation of $50 gets you an early-access e-book as well as a signed copy of Borderless Butterflies / Mariposas sin fronteras.
We are offering something very special for a $100 donation. You may choose one of the 4 haikus below (which open each of the 4 sections of the book) to be handwritten by Francisco on fine art paper, dated, and signed. You will also receive everything at the $50 level of support. This is a rare opportunity to receive a unique and very personal piece of art directly from the poet himself. Only 10 of each poem available!
Finally, if you are able to support us with a gift of $400 you will receive all four of the poems below, as well as the haiku Francisco is using to close his manuscript. This omnibus perk also includes everything at the $50 level, and will make for a wonderful vignette to display at home or at work. Only 5 are available.

A Press For Poets

Poetic Matrix Press was founded in 1997 in the high mountain beauty of Yosemite National Park. Originally a periodic poetry newsletter, we began publishing full-length volumes of poetry in 2003. We take pride in publishing books by poets with something to say and the skill to say it well. Most of our authors live in California, but we've published poets from all over America and the world. Several of our titles have won the San Diego Book Award for poetry, most recently KOHL & CHALK, by Shadab Zeest Hashmi.We take advantage of our small size and independence to support daring poets and exciting, surprising manuscripts. Francisco X. Alarcón is a very welcome addition to our community of writers.If poets and lovers of poetry don't write, publish, read, and purchase poetry books then we will have no say in the quality of our contemporary culture and no excuse for the abuses of language, ideas, truth, beauty, and love in our cultural life. 
Fundraising DetailsOur fundraising goal of $5000 will pay for all aspects of publication, from campaign setup, design costs, print costs, and new release marketing. The cost breakdown below is rough, but a reasonable estimate.


27% will go towards the design, editing, and proofing of the manuscript 



30% will be used to print the first run of books

20% will be used for distribution, marketing, and prize contest submission in support of the book during the first year after publication


23% IndieGoGo fees, campaign setup costs, and perk fulfillment
Thanks and credits
Thanks are first off due to James Downs, who introduced us to Francisco and made this whole campaign possible. Without James's support through the years and his uncanny knack for meeting amazing poets there would be no Poetix Matrix Press today.
Thanks also to Manuela Vargas Fernández for her work shooting and producing our delightful video material. Thanks to Kiirsti Peterson for help with recording and promotion
Thanks to Francisco for sharing his manuscript, his home, and his enthusiasm for our project. Thanks to Javier for the hospitality and laughs.
And thank you for your donations.

<p>This project is a tribute to the memory of my father Yuri Horlis-Horsky, who wrote the beautiful novel Cold Canyon about the Ukrainian Kozaks defending their country from the enemy in the year 1920.</p>
<p>When I was 2 days old my father disappeared.  We were living in a refugee camp in Germany after the war in 1946. Apparently he was murdered for his beliefs.</p>
<p>Cold Canyon was published in 1934 in Ukraine and became an instant best seller.  When the Soviets occupied Ukraine after WWII, the book was banned.  A special agent was assigned to hunt down copies. and anyone found with the book was arrested, to be shot or sent to Siberia.</p>
<p>After Ukraine became independent in 1991, the book resurfaced.  The new generation of Ukrainians were amazed to read about a part of their history they knew nothing about.  The book became a best seller again.</p>
<p>Cold Canyon (Kholodniy Yar) is written in Ukrainian.  A whole segment of the population is missing out on reading this important classic. It is not only a story of war, it is also a tragic love story.  Although written as a novel, the characters and events are real.</p>
<p>Millions of Ukrainians emigrated to all parts of the English speaking world. My daughters and I would like to have the book translated into English for the benefit of those of Ukrainian heritage and others.</p>
<p>Funds are necessary to pay the translator and publication costs.  We have found a translator and an editor in Ukraine who is willing to publish in English.  We have already translated the first chapter.  Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p>                                                  Chapter One</p>
<p>During the February 1920 partisan march, our cavalry unit of the Ukrainian National Army fought its way through the Bolshevik fronts and crossed into the town of Chehrin.</p>
<p>The sprawling landscape of the barren steppes give way to large forests, amid which are scattered small villages.</p>
<p>Our group passes the seemingly endless Black Forest. </p>
<p>The neat white thatched houses surrounded by orchards create a pleasant impression.</p>
<p>We are met with lovely dark eyed women wearing corsets and coral beads.  The men wear home spun tunics.  They are of classic Ukrainian type.</p>
<p>During our stay in one of the villages the farmers tell us of the unapproachable Motrin Monastery.  Chief Ataman Chuchupaka has settled there, and he is not afraid of anyone, especially the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>We glance at each other.  Wouldn't it be interesting to see this fortress?  We argue amongst ourselves whether we should go to Cold Canyon, or pass it by.....</p>

<h3>Long story short</h3>
<p>I started writing <em>Pho for Three</em>, a memoir of our adventures, soon after we returned from our first trip to Vietnam in 2007. I was slightly misguided on why we should be going and how much money it might actually require, but on Christmas 2006 we said goodbye to family and took off for Southeast Asia with $13 in my pocket and no return tickets.</p>
<p>We left and didn't look back, spending two months volunteering in Tam Ky. We met children whose disabilities exiled them from their families, others who'd lost their fathers in the all-too-frequent typhoons, and some with single mothers who could not keep them.I learned to love the orphans more than I would have thought possible. I learned, too, just how much I love my own children.</p>

<p>We went on to live in a hotel in Hanoi while I searched for work and at the last possible moment, found work teaching Engish in Thanh Hoa. Over the seven months in Vietnam, everything I'd ever thought, believed and expected completely changed and our lives haven't been the same since.</p>

<br/>The Big Idea</h3>
<p>What kicked off this idea to do a crowdfunding campaign was the need to get my book finished, edited and published. I'm on the second revision now and have lined up editing with two capable editors (one a developmental editor, the other is a copyeditor).</p>
<p>I work with a kick-ass writers group and they've helped me through more drafts than I'd like to admit.

I'm finally getting around to making it happen.</p>
<h3>It's more than just my book, it's about people I love</h3>
<p>There is no way I could do this if I didn't have a bigger reason--the people I love in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We will be donating 10% to each of two causes that are incredibly dear to me.

<p>The other is <strong>Mrs. Hanh's dream to open a restaurant</strong>, something I cannot be more proud of. Mrs. Hanh was our lovely cook in Tam Ky and she has served up the best Vietnamese and fusion dishes to hundreds of GVN volunteers over the years.

<p>I'm <strong>organizing a sew-along</strong> to make clothes for the kids there, and hoping that somehow we can raise the funds to not just mail the clothes through DHL, but to deliver them in person once again. It would be our fourth return trip to the orphanages and this time we've recruited help with the <strong>videography and photography</strong>.

<p><strong>Destructive Battles Rage Between Hellish Kaiju and Giant Mech Protectors</strong></p>
<p>A desperate father must rescue his son when a deadly kaiju rampages across his city.</p>
<p>When opportunists lurk and buildings crumble around him, the battle might be the least of his worries.  Each minute means more destruction, and the clock is ticking.</p>
<p>The first in a new kaiju series where the ordinary collides with the oversized, Collateral Damage is based on a short story of the same title originally published in Broadswords &amp; Blasters Magazine.  Experience the first taste of this series with a punch to the gut.  Mind the shadows -- you could be crushed.</p>
<strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong>
</div><div>
<p>Being an indie author, the costs associated with producing a quality work of fiction such as this is my responsibility.  Collateral Damage currently stands at around 57,000 words prior to professional editing.  Any part of the $500 goal shall be used for professional expenses, such as editing and cover art.  The professional editor has worked on a wide range of successful novels and is an award winning novelist as well.</p>
<p>Each Pledger will receive a digital copy of the book, with progressive perks available.  Digital copies will be mailed out prior to it being published.  Special Perks unlock when stretch goals are met.  Those that pledge in the beginning also have some input into future events in the series:</p>
<p>30% Funded ($150) - Current Pledgers help name a Star Force pilot for the series<br/>60% Funded ($300) - Current Pledgers help create a kaiju for the second novel, <i>Ground Zero</i></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>See What People Are Saying About the Short Story</strong></p>
<p>Before the transformation to a high-octane novel, Collateral Damage started as a 3,000 word scramble to safety in the Summer 2018 Issue of <i>Broadswords &amp; Blasters Magazine:</i></p>
<p><i>""Reversing the old trope of giant robots and monsters tearing apart a city, we have a  jarring narrative told with as much frenetic energy as <u>Cloverfield</u>. The intimate connection of father and son is front and center throughout this thrilling story. You can’t put this one down and Furman does everything he can to ensure it’s not a simple paint by numbers short of search and rescue.""</i><br/>-<strong><i>Pyles of Books</i></strong>, Alexander Pyles, May 2019</p>
<p><i>""Both Editors read the story multiple times...and every.  single.  time.  BAM!  Right in the feels.""</i><br/>-<strong><i>Broadswords &amp; Blasters</i></strong>, July 2018</p>
<p><i>""Some of my favorites in this issue include...the man on the streets view of a kaiju/mecha showdown of 'Collateral Damage'...5 star entertainment to be sure.""</i><br/>-<strong>Amazon Review, </strong>Anthony P., June 2019</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>
<p>We are just getting started.  I wasn't kidding about taking the ordinary to the oversized, the mundane to the massive.  The entire series will be funded through the following stretch goals, complete with diverse and unique perks progressively unlocked:</p>
<p><u>$1,250 <i>Ground Zero</i> Fully Funded</u><br/>    Digital Copy of <i>Ground Zero</i> to All Supporters<br/>    <i>Ground Zero</i> Hidden Perks Unlocked</p>
<p><u>$2,000 <i>Exclusion Zone</i> Fully Funded</u><br/>    Digital Copy of <i>Exclusion Zone<i> </i></i>to All Supporters<br/>    <i>Exclusion Zone</i> Hidden Perks Unlocked</p>
<p><u>$3,000 <i>State of Emergency</i> Fully Funded</u><br/>    Digital Copy of <i>State of Emergency<i> </i></i>to All Supporters<br/>    <i>State of Emergency</i> Hidden Perks Unlocked</p>
<p><strong>A Short Appetizer</strong></p>
<p>To give you a sense of what the book is about, I am including an <u>unedited </u>excerpt from an early chapter:</p>
<p>I stand from my desk.  I have to blink several times because the white background of my computer terminal burns my eyes.  Or at least it feels like it.  Every so often, I need to take a lap around the office.  I've got a hard time sitting still.  Ever since I was a kid, and it just sticks with me.</p>
<p>A happy blond man waves at me.  “Hey, DeShawn.  How are you doing?”</p>
<p>I muster a smile.  “Good, Dan.  I've just gotta--”  The floor goes out from under me.  My heart pounds, my vision narrows.  I gasp and look down.  The floor is there, unmoved.  “Did you...?”</p>
<p>“I almost...fell,” he says.</p>
<p>“Tremors.”  I glance around.  Everyone's glued to their computers.</p>
<p>“What?  What'd you say?” Dan asks me.  He's starting to look worried.</p>
<p>I clear my throat.  “I thought...I thought there were tremors.”</p>
<p>“Star Force engaged!” a shrill voice yells over the cubicles.</p>
<p>Everyone stops typing and a low rumble resounds through the office as people talk over each other.</p>
<p>“You're right, DeShawn,” Dan says.  He points at me and yells for everyone to hear.  “DeShawn called it like five minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“Five seconds,” I mumble.</p>
<p>“Here it is!”  And the visual footage of the fight is projected on our office wall.</p>
<p>A giant multicolored combination mech stands at the outskirts of Jefferson, crouched behind a building.  It's dubbed FRIEND by Star Force and the government.  The combo mech stands opposite of a giant horned monster that looks like a bipedal wildebeest.  About as hairy as one, too.</p>
<p>“Look at that f***in' thing.”</p>
<p>“Good thing we have Star Force.”</p>
<p>“How would we deal with monsters without Star Force?”</p>
<p>“They're really a blessing.”</p>
<p>Dan nudges me.  “Wonder where ALLY is, huh?”</p>
<p>I shrug.  “Probably has to pick up his suit from the dry cleaner.”</p>
<p>Dan doesn't reply and after a few seconds I glance at him.  His eyes are narrowed and brow scrunched to his nose, hatred directed at me.</p>
<p>“What's your problem, dude?”</p>
<p>My eyes go wide.  I didn't expect the retort.  “It's just...a joke.”</p>
<p>Dan points at the screen.  “Look at that monstrosity.  It's not a joke.  Our survival as a human race isn't funny.”</p>
<p>“I didn't mean--”</p>
<p>“Then what <u>did</u> you mean, DeShawn, huh?”</p>
<p>S**t.  “He's probably waiting to surprise the monster.”</p>
<p>Dan looks at me for another few seconds before his face relaxes.  “Yeah, ALLY does that some times.”  He chuckles.  “I remember a few years back there was this two-headed f***er that really beat on FRIEND.  They got to a bridge or something and ALLY jumps out of the water, rockets at full burn.  And he just takes his sword and cuts off both heads in one action.”</p>
<p>I nod.  “Yeah, I remember that one.”  It's still one of the most viewed Star Force engagements on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Like...you didn't even see ALLY coming, DeShawn.  It was just a flash of orange and then blood.  Blood everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, man.  I remember,” I say.  “The people in the nearby Star Shelter drowned from the blood.”</p>
<p>Dan leans back, rubs his chin.  “Oh, yeah.”  He frowns.  “That's when they added water pumps in the Shelters.”</p>
<p>“That's the reason,” I say.  “These things are dangerous.  Good thing we have Star Force.”  I add that last part for good measure.  Patriotism is alive and well.  While it's changed over the years, certain crowds still frown on you if you aren't pro-Star Force, like that's the only legitimate stance.</p>
<p>Dan claps my shoulder.  “Yes.  DeShawn, it's a good thing we have Star Force.  They protect you and me.  And no matter how you feel about me, I'd hate to see you gone.”</p>
<p>His last sentence takes me aback.  I'm not sure if it's because of the vulnerability or the truthfulness of his statement, but it makes me smile.  Especially when I just offended his ultra-Star Force views.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Dan.”  I point back towards my cubicle.  No need to take a lap around the office after I just wasted the time speaking with Dan.  My boss would hate any more dormant activity on my terminal.</p>
<p>I sit down and type, programming the next thing for a customer that might not exist tomorrow, their building and everyone in it obliterated by Star Force and a giant monster.</p>
<p>It's so hard to focus.  Everyone in the office turns to their favorite news station to hear the battle.  They're all pro-Star Force.  They have to be.  Why would Star Force fight for us if we condemned them?</p>
<p>A man reports the battle from a helicopter.  Independent journalists use a drone to record with their voices dubbed over.  A daring woman drives her van as close to the battle, chasing the fight as best she can.  Another reports the aftermath, telling the battle from the past tense as he walks through carnage, debris everywhere and people screaming for help.  One sick news agency reports the battle as an adventurous boxing match between Star Force and the monster.  And I watch as downtown Jefferson is leveled.</p>

</div></div>","Destructive Battles Rage Between Hellish Kaiju and Giant Mech Protectors
A desperate father must rescue his son when a deadly kaiju rampages across his city.
When opportunists lurk and buildings crumble around him, the battle might be the least of his worries.  Each minute means more destruction, and the clock is ticking.
The first in a new kaiju series where the ordinary collides with the oversized, Collateral Damage is based on a short story of the same title originally published in Broadswords & Blasters Magazine.  Experience the first taste of this series with a punch to the gut.  Mind the shadows -- you could be crushed.
What We Need & What You Get

Being an indie author, the costs associated with producing a quality work of fiction such as this is my responsibility.  Collateral Damage currently stands at around 57,000 words prior to professional editing.  Any part of the $500 goal shall be used for professional expenses, such as editing and cover art.  The professional editor has worked on a wide range of successful novels and is an award winning novelist as well.
Each Pledger will receive a digital copy of the book, with progressive perks available.  Digital copies will be mailed out prior to it being published.  Special Perks unlock when stretch goals are met.  Those that pledge in the beginning also have some input into future events in the series:
30% Funded ($150) - Current Pledgers help name a Star Force pilot for the series60% Funded ($300) - Current Pledgers help create a kaiju for the second novel, Ground Zero

See What People Are Saying About the Short Story
Before the transformation to a high-octane novel, Collateral Damage started as a 3,000 word scramble to safety in the Summer 2018 Issue of Broadswords & Blasters Magazine:
""Reversing the old trope of giant robots and monsters tearing apart a city, we have a  jarring narrative told with as much frenetic energy as Cloverfield. The intimate connection of father and son is front and center throughout this thrilling story. You can’t put this one down and Furman does everything he can to ensure it’s not a simple paint by numbers short of search and rescue.""-Pyles of Books, Alexander Pyles, May 2019
""Both Editors read the story multiple times...and every.  single.  time.  BAM!  Right in the feels.""-Broadswords & Blasters, July 2018
""Some of my favorites in this issue include...the man on the streets view of a kaiju/mecha showdown of 'Collateral Damage'...5 star entertainment to be sure.""-Amazon Review, Anthony P., June 2019
Stretch Goals
We are just getting started.  I wasn't kidding about taking the ordinary to the oversized, the mundane to the massive.  The entire series will be funded through the following stretch goals, complete with diverse and unique perks progressively unlocked:
$1,250 Ground Zero Fully Funded    Digital Copy of Ground Zero to All Supporters    Ground Zero Hidden Perks Unlocked
$2,000 Exclusion Zone Fully Funded    Digital Copy of Exclusion Zone to All Supporters    Exclusion Zone Hidden Perks Unlocked

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Manuel está condenado a una sentencia de olvido. Pronto no recordará su nombre ni su edad. Su única tabla de salvación pasa por continuar escribiendo. De ese ejercicio de supervivencia nace la historia de Malva y Andrés, dos jóvenes llamados a encontrarse en una ciudad de provincias de la España de la transición.

¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy se nos presenta Luisa Ruiz Chacón.
La culpa de mi antojo por desgranar palabras la comparten, a partes iguales, la biblioteca de mi padre, una rosa y una mano rozando un cristal; los tres elementos se confabularon en mi infancia para desvelarme que lo que yo creía un mundo real, horrible e injusto podría metamorfosearse en lo que quisiera si sabía usar los vocablos adecuados.

<br/><i>Outside With Elephants </i>is a love story that follows three young people as they navigate young adulthood. We travel with them as they explore the new faces, places and experiences that condition them as they look to live lives of great impact.<br/><br/>My name is Martin Angus Jr. and I am the author of <i>Outside With Elephants</i>. I wrote this book to help me make sense of my complicated past. Historically, I have been terrible at love. I’ve always wanted it, desperately, but could never define it, so it was impossible to know whether I was getting what I so desperately longed for. Or even more so, how I was impacting the lives of others in my ignorance to it. <br/><br/>What is “Love” anyway? Like so many of us, I grew up adopting what those around me defined love as. What my mother thought it was (or wasn't) or what my grandparents would say. ""Love is a verb!"" or ""Love is unconditional!"" Conceptually, I get it, but I never stopped to ask what it meant to <i>me</i> so I could never truly own it. I could never truly be it. Is it a noun? A verb? Both? Is it only romantic? How many different types of love are there?<br/><br/>It was on the morning of Day 3, of a 10-day silent mediation retreat at a small meditation center in the foothills of Napa Valley, California, that something shifted in me. I had an epiphany as to what “Love” meant, to <i>me</i>. Ever since then, I have been on a quest to understand what happened that day, and how to tell its story. With this novel and its characters, I look to tell the story of “Love” in the best way I can - by telling my own.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, somewhere in the stories of these three young people, you will explore what love means to you and begin to define it for yourself. My purpose isn’t to give you any answers, but to inspire you to ask yourself more questions. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a guide to inspire your path to more truly loving yourself, and the world around us.<br/><br/>In this book, we'll explore:<ul>
<li>The development on one's character</li>
<li>The definition of ‘true love’</li>
<li>The difference between self-care and selfishness</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>The Posterchildren is a YA superhero novel that focuses on LGBTQ themes, female empowerment, POCs, and minority issues. The Posterchildren project's goal is to generate the funding needed for a print run of the first novel. With your support, we will be able to get this book into the hands of people who have been looking for a hero like them. </p>
<p>Growing up, YA fiction was how I made sense of myself and the world around me. It was my ethics, my sex ed, and my escape. I was a voracious reader, and I truly believe that the stories I absorbed when I was young shaped who I am today. Finding myself in YA fiction wasn’t easy, though. LGBTQ fiction was hard to find, and most of the stuff I got my hands on were coming out stories. What I really needed were stories grounded in hope - stories that reflected the fact that I wasn’t alone, that there was no right answer for who I was supposed to be (or who I should/shouldn’t love), and that being feminine or sensitive was not something to be ashamed of. I wanted stories where queer characters were given the same depth and life as their heterosexual counterparts - where they didn’t exist solely to “be” queer. I wanted to see someone like myself as more than a plot point. I wanted to know that the definition of family does not begin and end with biological connections.</p>
<p>With your help, I aim to publish and print that kind of story. The Posterchildren revolves heavily around the training of an Arab American posterchild named Malek Underwood. A top-ranking student at Maillardet's Academy for the Future of Humanity, the leading school in training posterchildren to control their abilities and shape their future, Mal finds himself suddenly knocked from his pedestal at the top of his class and thrown to the bottom. Paired with an almost-failing lesbian speedster named Zipporah Chance, the two of them discover that the world is far more complex than grades and tests - or even ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Fortunately, it isn't a world that they have to brave alone. </p>

<p>The project is pretty simple: I want to make physical copies of this novel available. The $3500 goal is the funding needed for the initial print run. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will be printing as many copies as we can with the funds we raised here. If we exceed the goal, I will be able to focus on writing and releasing the second novel, as well as an anthology of short stories set in this universe. </p>

<p>A twenty-five year old resident of Portland, I spend most of my time enjoying the rain from a respectable distance (re: indoors). As a fan of comic books, I'm overly invested in people who wear spandex and habitually take bites out of crime. When I'm not reading or critiquing comics, I'm writing my own. This project has been the culmination of several years of work - my work, as well as the talent of the artists that have created character designs for The Posterchildren - so thank you so much for your time and consideration! </p></div>","The Posterchildren is a YA superhero novel that focuses on LGBTQ themes, female empowerment, POCs, and minority issues. The Posterchildren project's goal is to generate the funding needed for a print run of the first novel. With your support, we will be able to get this book into the hands of people who have been looking for a hero like them. 
Growing up, YA fiction was how I made sense of myself and the world around me. It was my ethics, my sex ed, and my escape. I was a voracious reader, and I truly believe that the stories I absorbed when I was young shaped who I am today. Finding myself in YA fiction wasn’t easy, though. LGBTQ fiction was hard to find, and most of the stuff I got my hands on were coming out stories. What I really needed were stories grounded in hope - stories that reflected the fact that I wasn’t alone, that there was no right answer for who I was supposed to be (or who I should/shouldn’t love), and that being feminine or sensitive was not something to be ashamed of. I wanted stories where queer characters were given the same depth and life as their heterosexual counterparts - where they didn’t exist solely to “be” queer. I wanted to see someone like myself as more than a plot point. I wanted to know that the definition of family does not begin and end with biological connections.
With your help, I aim to publish and print that kind of story. The Posterchildren revolves heavily around the training of an Arab American posterchild named Malek Underwood. A top-ranking student at Maillardet's Academy for the Future of Humanity, the leading school in training posterchildren to control their abilities and shape their future, Mal finds himself suddenly knocked from his pedestal at the top of his class and thrown to the bottom. Paired with an almost-failing lesbian speedster named Zipporah Chance, the two of them discover that the world is far more complex than grades and tests - or even ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Fortunately, it isn't a world that they have to brave alone. 
 
READ THE FIRST CHAPTER HERE!

 
  



 
The project is pretty simple: I want to make physical copies of this novel available. The $3500 goal is the funding needed for the initial print run. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will be printing as many copies as we can with the funds we raised here. If we exceed the goal, I will be able to focus on writing and releasing the second novel, as well as an anthology of short stories set in this universe.

STRETCH GOALS

<p>I just finished writing a very personal book.  Its not my ideal way I would like to be introduced to the world BUT I feel the need to get this book published and released publicly.  6 years ago I found myself alone, stuck and confused about my belief in God and confused about my sexuality.  </p>

<p>Later that year I decided I that would talk about it.  I would be the face of people who are going though what I went though.  If I could help one other person who was in the same shoes as I would then I would be satisfyed.</p>

<p>I'm doing everything myself.  I felt it would be best to self-publish my 1st book.  But to do that I need funding.  It takes a lot of time and money to write a book.  I need to raise $9,000 by July 31st.  Once I pay for the services ""Believer's Press"" offers my book will then go into production.  My target date to release my book is January 2014!!!  </p>

Through a collection of interdisciplinary essays, I aim to bridge the gap between these different factions that don’t always communicate, exploring the syntheses and frictions between the business-oriented, creative, and cultural worlds as the music ecosystem experiences unprecedented growth and unprecedented challenges.<br/><br/>My name is Saransh Desai-Chowdhry, and I am the author of <i>Soundstorm: Musings on the Madness of the Modern Music Ecosystem</i>, set for publication in December 2020. Across twenty essays, I draw from my personal and professional experiences and the insight of artistic and commercial trailblazers in music. Music has always been the lens through which I see the world, and as a young, multicultural product of the digital age, I want to consider potential futures for the music ecosystem.<br/><br/>According to a June 2019 Goldman Sachs report, the recorded music market will hit $45 billion by 2030; however, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, tours have been postponed indefinitely, executives have been furloughed, and many artists have lost their instruments, their jobs, and even their homes. As such, the music ecosystem is at a crossroads. The decisions we make as a collective, today, could have long standing impacts on the future of all individuals and entities who exist in this space. With creative disruption inevitably around the corner, I consider the following question—don’t we owe it to ourselves to do our best to establish a system that works well—or at least better—for listeners, artists, and artist advocates alike?<br/><br/>In <i>Soundstorm</i>, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the world of music in you. In reading this book, you will discover the cultural patterns and phenomena that underline many of the ways you engage with music.

The city’s cultural community is being hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and since New Orleans' artistic spirit has deeply inspired me in the writing of this book, I want to do my part and give back! The remaining 25% will assist me with future marketing materials, book talks, and other opportunities related to sharing my story!To everyone who has supported me thus far, thank you so much for making my dream come true! Story of My BookMuch has been written about trends and patterns in music, but such work is almost always done within entirely distinct silos. Through a collection of interdisciplinary essays, I aim to bridge the gap between these different factions that don’t always communicate, exploring the syntheses and frictions between the business-oriented, creative, and cultural worlds as the music ecosystem experiences unprecedented growth and unprecedented challenges.My name is Saransh Desai-Chowdhry, and I am the author of Soundstorm: Musings on the Madness of the Modern Music Ecosystem, set for publication in December 2020. Across twenty essays, I draw from my personal and professional experiences and the insight of artistic and commercial trailblazers in music. Music has always been the lens through which I see the world, and as a young, multicultural product of the digital age, I want to consider potential futures for the music ecosystem.According to a June 2019 Goldman Sachs report, the recorded music market will hit $45 billion by 2030; however, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, tours have been postponed indefinitely, executives have been furloughed, and many artists have lost their instruments, their jobs, and even their homes. As such, the music ecosystem is at a crossroads. The decisions we make as a collective, today, could have long standing impacts on the future of all individuals and entities who exist in this space. With creative disruption inevitably around the corner, I consider the following question—don’t we owe it to ourselves to do our best to establish a system that works well—or at least better—for listeners, artists, and artist advocates alike?In Soundstorm, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the world of music in you. In reading this book, you will discover the cultural patterns and phenomena that underline many of the ways you engage with music. Ultimately, I hope this book can be clarifying, a tool for you to appreciate not just the music business but also many of the adjacent communities enveloping it—criticism, education, technology and several other fields—that are equally as important in determining how music is made and how it ends up penetrating the soundscape and our eardrums.You will love reading this book if you love music or are a fan of personal essays and nonfiction storytelling. Moreover, if you are a music business student, a music executive, or another member of the music industry, you can use this book to gauge a young, multicultural perspective on the ecosystem.The Book - Soundstorm: Musings on the Madness of the Modern Music Ecosystem

<div>For the past 17 years I have been working with children teaching them sports, healthy lifestyles, and motivating them to be the best they can be in anything they want to be. My greatest gift is when a teenager tells me they made the right decision because I had an affect on them.  </div>
<div>Right now my goal is to bring down bullying, but in a different way. By empowering the victims AS WELL as the bullies. </div>
<div>As a child I was bullied. I was picked on because I was different. It showed  in all of my expressions. Within the year I was able to beat bullying, and didn’t have to throw one punch or resort to violence to do it either! I found multiple ways to empower myself which not only stopped the bullying but all of a sudden I was friends with the same kids that picked on me. What is the most important part of this is that I learned that bullies themselves have very difficult lives which is part of why they pick on other children. <br/>
</div>
<div>I will be writing a book with my expertise and knowledge that can ultimately empower the victims and bullies, to give them the confidence they need and self-esteem they need to get through any tough time in their lives. I will be writing this book with a Psychotherapist (who I will be introducing in one of the update videos) who will go deep into the minds of these children and what they are experiencing, as well as exercises and tools to help these children accomplish the goals of increasing their life value and self-esteem to where bullies don't bother them anymore and where bullies don't have to put others down to make themselves feel better! This book will help save lives. So I ask you one question... Are you with me?!!</div>

We are looking to raise  £3,500. One of the most challenging tasks in running an indie magazine is the cost and logistics of a worldwide distribution. We want to give a voice to Polish artists and build a platform for experts to report on them. Reaching out to new readers from across the globe is the most exciting part of publishing a print magazine. However, the cost of shipping, logistics and transportation sometimes threaten to overwhelm our budget, and restrict us from crossing the oceans and going further. Your help is vital in making this happen! </p><p>We offer: unique curated content / cutting edge commentary / quality print / fresh thinking / each cover is a unique artwork painted acrylic on PVC/ Illustrations made by acclaimed artists</p><p> </p><p><strong>LYNX STORY</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490980090/oxypnopqabug2amb1sgl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We — Dobromiła and Sylwia — are Editors-in-Chief and founders of Contemporary Lynx Magazine. We are excited to share our project with you, one that we have been working with our team extremely hard on for the past six months. We hope that this campaign will help us finance and distribute the fifth edition of Contemporary Lynx Magazine. We look to raise £3,500.00, which will cover a big part of the costs of distribution of this issue. Come and join us!</p><p>Our friendship started at university where we studied the history of art. Surprised by a lack of information about Polish artists in English and their successes abroad, we set up a blog in 2013. The idea was simple — to spread the news across the world of talented Polish artists who practice internationally, their successes, and to celebrate Polish visual culture. Month after month we have become stronger by gaining the trust of the artistic community, and an expanding reader base. After two years of online reporting we decided to go print! In 2015, we published the first printed issue. Meanwhile, our team has grown from two founders to more than 30 contributors from across the globe, who are based in Beijing, Hong Kong, Poland, Germany, France, UK, Sweden, Spain and the US.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490980118/dqwbfmqdtoph1q0zjyfu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Today, Contemporary Lynx is the only independent, English-language magazine, devoted to visual culture with a strong focus on Polish art. We aim to showcase talented Polish artists while placing them firmly in the global art scene, and at the centre of current trends and global affairs. The magazine is distributed worldwide; across Europe, in the USA and Asia and is available in selected galleries, museums, bookstores and cultural centres, as well as, on our website. The additional distribution includes international art fairs and art events promoted by Polish Cultural Institutes across the globe. </p><p>Contemporary Lynx is the fruit of our friendship, and our team’s hard work and passion for Polish art.

<li>Fascinating interviews with street artists Zbiok and Invader</li>
<li>A signature mix of reporting and essays on street art, urban design, photography in public space, street art and the Internet, and city reports on the artistic scenes of Lisbon and Łódź</li>
<li>All the content in the Magazine is available exclusively offline</li>
<li>Printed on a mix of beautiful offset and glossy papers</li>
<li>164 pages, 2964 copies, each stamped and signed</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>CONTENT</strong></p><p>From protest art to anti-surveillance art, in this issue, we bring engaging reviews on art in the public space, exploring how urban art shapes societies and cityscapes. As Magdalena Abakanowicz once pointed out: <i>Art does not solve problems but makes us aware of their existence. It opens our eyes to see and our brain to imagine.</i> Contemporary art, similarly to philosophy, constantly asks us questions, which are often inconvenient, annoying or occur at an unexpected time and place. It draws us into a conversation, but on its own terms. The most sensitive and at the same time most brutal place in this respect, is the ’street’. It is in this place that artists express their views in the most direct way and communicate with passers-by. We ask what is the public space today, we discuss the relations between street art and the net, and present how artists engage directly in current political events, supporting protests, manifestations or simply discussing the shape of the surrounding reality.</p><p>Contemporary Lynx Magazine is the ultimate foreigner’s guide to contemporary art, design photography and visual culture from Poland.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491219256/gmtedug5inrw0as5sfbm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491219294/egthkwe56khksj5wzb7u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491219309/p8pqvuqkjt1a3pgcqpl1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491219393/uzykosi4zcutzzoaumjr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491219457/phwxq25lxqhtxjdt9ezy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491219368/pwmpd4h0dh2xp8p9bj78.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW WE MADE OUR HAND-PAINTED COVER</strong></p><p>Contemporary Lynx invited street artist Sławek ZBIOK Czajkowski to participate in a project unlike any other before — to hand paint 2,964 magazine covers, which will comprise the fifth print issue of our magazine. At the TRAFO Centre for Contemporary Art in Szczecin, ZBIOK transformed rows of blank white PVC sheets into striking works of colour. Every sheet is part of a larger collective image — a 16 x 11-metre painting titled, ‘The World Is A Mess’, depicting a luminous sea harbour clad in glaring shades of lime green, azure and cobalt blue.

One of the most challenging tasks in running an indie magazine is the cost and logistics of a worldwide distribution. We want to give a voice to Polish artists and build a platform for experts to report on them. Reaching out to new readers from across the globe is the most exciting part of publishing a print magazine. However, the cost of shipping, logistics and transportation sometimes threaten to overwhelm our budget, and restrict us from crossing the oceans and going further. Your help is vital in making this happen! We offer: unique curated content / cutting edge commentary / quality print / fresh thinking / each cover is a unique artwork painted acrylic on PVC/ Illustrations made by acclaimed artists LYNX STORYWe — Dobromiła and Sylwia — are Editors-in-Chief and founders of Contemporary Lynx Magazine. We are excited to share our project with you, one that we have been working with our team extremely hard on for the past six months. We hope that this campaign will help us finance and distribute the fifth edition of Contemporary Lynx Magazine. We look to raise £3,500.00, which will cover a big part of the costs of distribution of this issue. Come and join us!Our friendship started at university where we studied the history of art. Surprised by a lack of information about Polish artists in English and their successes abroad, we set up a blog in 2013. The idea was simple — to spread the news across the world of talented Polish artists who practice internationally, their successes, and to celebrate Polish visual culture. Month after month we have become stronger by gaining the trust of the artistic community, and an expanding reader base. After two years of online reporting we decided to go print! In 2015, we published the first printed issue. Meanwhile, our team has grown from two founders to more than 30 contributors from across the globe, who are based in Beijing, Hong Kong, Poland, Germany, France, UK, Sweden, Spain and the US.Today, Contemporary Lynx is the only independent, English-language magazine, devoted to visual culture with a strong focus on Polish art. We aim to showcase talented Polish artists while placing them firmly in the global art scene, and at the centre of current trends and global affairs. The magazine is distributed worldwide; across Europe, in the USA and Asia and is available in selected galleries, museums, bookstores and cultural centres, as well as, on our website. The additional distribution includes international art fairs and art events promoted by Polish Cultural Institutes across the globe. Contemporary Lynx is the fruit of our friendship, and our team’s hard work and passion for Polish art. Join us in supporting independent arts from Poland — we need your help to make Lynx happen! WHY IS THE FIFTH ISSUE OF CONTEMPORARY LYNX SO SPECIAL?
Each issue has a unique hand-painted cover by Zbiok (check out the video of how he did it)!
Fascinating interviews with street artists Zbiok and Invader
A signature mix of reporting and essays on street art, urban design, photography in public space, street art and the Internet, and city reports on the artistic scenes of Lisbon and Łódź
All the content in the Magazine is available exclusively offline
Printed on a mix of beautiful offset and glossy papers
164 pages, 2964 copies, each stamped and signed
 CONTENTFrom protest art to anti-surveillance art, in this issue, we bring engaging reviews on art in the public space, exploring how urban art shapes societies and cityscapes. As Magdalena Abakanowicz once pointed out: Art does not solve problems but makes us aware of their existence. It opens our eyes to see and our brain to imagine. Contemporary art, similarly to philosophy, constantly asks us questions, which are often inconvenient, annoying or occur at an unexpected time and place. It draws us into a conversation, but on its own terms. The most sensitive and at the same time most brutal place in this respect, is the ’street’. It is in this place that artists express their views in the most direct way and communicate with passers-by. We ask what is the public space today, we discuss the relations between street art and the net, and present how artists engage directly in current political events, supporting protests, manifestations or simply discussing the shape of the surrounding reality.Contemporary Lynx Magazine is the ultimate foreigner’s guide to contemporary art, design photography and visual culture from Poland.   HOW WE MADE OUR HAND-PAINTED COVERContemporary Lynx invited street artist Sławek ZBIOK Czajkowski to participate in a project unlike any other before — to hand paint 2,964 magazine covers, which will comprise the fifth print issue of our magazine. At the TRAFO Centre for Contemporary Art in Szczecin, ZBIOK transformed rows of blank white PVC sheets into striking works of colour. Every sheet is part of a larger collective image — a 16 x 11-metre painting titled, ‘The World Is A Mess’, depicting a luminous sea harbour clad in glaring shades of lime green, azure and cobalt blue. In this way, every magazine cover is its own work of art, an inimitable mark and trace left by the artist himself, unlike the ‘reproduction’ covers that are seen in the traditional format of printing and publishing.  The title ‘The World Is A Mess’ is a quote from one of Donald Trump’s speeches, someone who is clearing the way for a dark wave of conservatism, nationalism, racism and the sinister cult of force to sweep in. — explains the artist Zbiok, adding” I'm interested in the idea of privilege, and the resulting ease of judging others in the context of economics, skin colour, sexual orientation, or place of birth.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Agonía y Esperanza</strong> es una historia llena de sentimiento con un escenario incomparable, como homenaje a la obra <i>Persuasión </i>de Jane Austen en este 2017 que es, a la postre, su bicentenario.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Frédéric Heywood y Anna Wellesley eran dos jóvenes alegres, ingeniosos y con ganas de comerse el mundo cuando se conocieron. Reconociéndose como hechos el uno para el otro, vivieron su amor incondicional durante unos meses de felicidad sin límite. Pero los condicionantes sociales de ella, perteneciente a una familia acaudalada y aristocrática, la llevaron a romper su relación con un simple aspirante a escritor de clase media.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Varios años después, las circunstancias han cambiado. Frédéric se ha convertido en un escritor de éxito y prestigioso. Por su parte, los Wellesley, cuyas empresas han quebrado por efecto de la crisis financiera, se encuentran arruinados y viviendo más de su nombre que de sus escasos ingresos. Al reencontrarse a las puertas de Venecia, donde ambos van a residir durante algún tiempo, Frédéric se debate entre el resentimiento que ha sentido durante todo ese tiempo de separación y un sentimiento que remueve su interior y no sabe interpretar.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Basada en el argumento de la íntima y conmovedora <i>Persuasión</i>, de Jane Austen, y manteniendo ese mismo tono y estilo cuidado y elegante, <strong>Agonía y esperanza </strong>es una historia romántica de elegancia emocional, de madurez anímica y segundas oportunidades.</p>

I know this may not be as important to you as it is to me, but I really need to do this. I need to buy books, fix the van, and cover my expenses. Please donate what you can. $5, $10, $15, whatever. It all helps.<br/>Thanks.</p><p>And now back to our longer pitch...</p><p>I walked away from a successful career as a sound designer on films like <i>My Own Private Idaho</i> and <i>Good Will Hunting</i> to tell my own stories and make my own films. For me it was never about the money it was always about the story.</p><p>I write because I have to. Something burns deep inside me that needs to create. I wrote <i>Road Dog</i> because I had to. I have stories to tell. What’s the good of having a story to tell when there’s no one around to listen?</p><p>I’m going out on tour this fall to promote my book, <i>Road Dog</i>, and I need your help.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">""A man and his dog hit the road and discover America. What more do you need to know? <i>Road Dog</i> joins the annals of great travelogues."" - Don Campbell, Writer, musician, road dog</p><p>I started touring in 2005 when no distributors showed interest in my independent films. I tore a page out of the punk rock handbook, burned a thousand DVD’s (one at a time) and traveled the country in a borrowed pickup truck. The following spring I bought a used van and hit the road with my 120-pound Chocolate Lab, Moses.</p><p>We toured the US twice a year for seven years. Over the years we had some harrowing adventures and met a lot of interesting people. I gave an audio workshop for employees of a porn channel, was asked to leave the Prayer Tower at Oral Roberts University, drove 2400 miles in three days so I wouldn’t miss my daughter’s choir recital, and met a <i>way</i> overzealous drug sniffing border patrol dog outside El Paso, Texas.</p><p>We logged over 200,000 miles as I showed my films at universities, media art centers, independent theaters, even bars.</p><p>Moses passed away in 2009 and for health reasons I stopped touring in 2012.

You have to be driven to do whatever it takes to get your work in front of an audience. And you have to engage with them one on one.  </p><p>I need your help because touring is expensive especially with no publisher behind me. I have to pay for everything, most of it up front. I need to order books, get the van fixed, upgrade my laptop, get a new hard drive and some memory cards, pay for gas, food, lodging, and other expenses while we’re out on the road.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">“Kelley Baker is a storyteller par excellence - on film and now in prose.

I really want to go out on tour this fall to promote Road Dog. Honestly I believe it’s the best thing I’ve done, so far. I am so proud of this book and I want to put it out in front of as many people as possible. I know this may not be as important to you as it is to me, but I really need to do this. I need to buy books, fix the van, and cover my expenses. Please donate what you can. $5, $10, $15, whatever. It all helps.Thanks.And now back to our longer pitch...I walked away from a successful career as a sound designer on films like My Own Private Idaho and Good Will Hunting to tell my own stories and make my own films. For me it was never about the money it was always about the story.I write because I have to. Something burns deep inside me that needs to create. I wrote Road Dog because I had to. I have stories to tell. What’s the good of having a story to tell when there’s no one around to listen?I’m going out on tour this fall to promote my book, Road Dog, and I need your help.""A man and his dog hit the road and discover America. What more do you need to know? Road Dog joins the annals of great travelogues."" - Don Campbell, Writer, musician, road dogI started touring in 2005 when no distributors showed interest in my independent films. I tore a page out of the punk rock handbook, burned a thousand DVD’s (one at a time) and traveled the country in a borrowed pickup truck. The following spring I bought a used van and hit the road with my 120-pound Chocolate Lab, Moses.We toured the US twice a year for seven years. Over the years we had some harrowing adventures and met a lot of interesting people. I gave an audio workshop for employees of a porn channel, was asked to leave the Prayer Tower at Oral Roberts University, drove 2400 miles in three days so I wouldn’t miss my daughter’s choir recital, and met a way overzealous drug sniffing border patrol dog outside El Paso, Texas.We logged over 200,000 miles as I showed my films at universities, media art centers, independent theaters, even bars.Moses passed away in 2009 and for health reasons I stopped touring in 2012. Since then I’ve had two open-heart surgeries and today I feel great.“A much-needed Travels With Charley for today... Road Dog is a cure for the blues, a lot of laughs, and a delightful lesson in being alive.” - - William M. Akers, author, Your Screenplay Sucks!, Mrs. Ravenbach's WayIndependent publishing is like independent filmmaking. You have to be driven to do whatever it takes to get your work in front of an audience. And you have to engage with them one on one.  I need your help because touring is expensive especially with no publisher behind me. I have to pay for everything, most of it up front. I need to order books, get the van fixed, upgrade my laptop, get a new hard drive and some memory cards, pay for gas, food, lodging, and other expenses while we’re out on the road.“Kelley Baker is a storyteller par excellence - on film and now in prose. In Road Dog we have the pleasure of journeying with ""the Angry Filmmaker"" as he careens across the American landscape with his dog Moses. Awesome fun and also quite touching. A love poem to a special canine and to the open road.” – Beth Harrington, Independent FilmmakerIt’s been over six years since I’ve done a full-blown tour.

<p>My name is Chey.  I do not know why I ended up living here or even when I arrived. Nor do I know my age.  My background is also a mystery.  Everyday I compete with others to pick up things that were thrown away on the stinking garbage pile.</p>
<p>Many people run after the garbage truck.  Garbage is our money; I and others run after the money. Some people say that I have done this job even in my previous life. How could they know about my previous life?  I don't even know about my own background now.  I don't even know my parents.</p>
<p>One day, there is an accident.  A monk falls into a fetid water channel with a dead dog in it. The people don't dare to help the monk; they just stand and watch as I save him from the smelly water. The awful odor is easy for me. Still it doesn't mean I don't like the fragrance of flowers.  I know that rotting things attract flies; flowers attract butterflies.  There is no butterfly on the garbage heap.  It has only flies, blue and grey headed flies.</p>
<p>Gold is still gold even when it has fallen into the mud.  The monk has fallen into smelly water; no one dares to approach him since he is not gold. The value of a person is based on the situation.  I help him to his home in the pagoda.....</p>

</div></div>","About this project
Why is it important?
It's important for young emerging Cambodian writers to see their work in print. It validates creativity and the significance of the written word;
It's important for young Cambodians to develop a literature that represents their own experience in modernizing Cambodia.
Background

This project
supports the publication of the only literary journal in Cambodia: The Nou Hach Literary Journal.  After a hiatus of three years, we would like to publish Volume 7, which contains  award winning poetry and short fiction from the 2011 and 2013
literary contests sponsored by the  Nou Hach Literary Association (NHLA)
in Phnom Penh. NHLA is an NGO established in 2002 with the intent to support the development of  younger creative writers in Cambodia and to provide a venue for them to publish.  It also fosters an emerging modern literary tradition for Cambodia, which was disrupted during the Khmer Rouge era.  Since the 1990s writers still struggle to establish a new tradition due to high publication costs, and a unregulated market of pirated books.   Some of our writers associated with the Nou Hach Literary Association have achieved literary fame: Sok Chanphal was recently awarded the SEA WRITE AWARD for Cambodia.   Writers associated with NHLA produce both socially critical and imaginative fiction and poetry.  They are at the cutting edge of developing new literature for the younger generation of college educated Khmer.  A strong literary tradition influences literacy, an area where Cambodia lags behind other Asian countries. 
         We support young Cambodian writers to develop a new literary tradition of their own with free workshops lead by talented American, European, and Australian poets and fiction writers  volunteering their time while we provide the venue. There are no creative writing programs in Cambodian universities.

      Some Highlights in English for Vol. 7



""Strobe Lights""  by Yeng Cheangly (Second Place Award
for Poetry, 2013)
                                Awesome! 
This nightclub in the city
                                     Its strobe
lights  brightly flashing
                                     Light
swirling everywhere
                                     Shimmering
in every color...
                                Colorful
light fills the inside,
                                      Outside,
pitch black darkness.
                                      Hungry lives
walking, exploring
                                      Without the
same clarifying light.

""Starlight""  by Chieh Kim Heang

Steung Mean Chey, my wonderland...The pile of garbage is my property; the property that never drains dry.
My name is Chey.  I do not know why I ended up living here or even when I arrived. Nor do I know my age.  My background is also a mystery.  Everyday I compete with others to pick up things that were thrown away on the stinking garbage pile.
Many people run after the garbage truck.  Garbage is our money; I and others run after the money. Some people say that I have done this job even in my previous life. How could they know about my previous life?  I don't even know about my own background now.  I don't even know my parents.
One day, there is an accident.  A monk falls into a fetid water channel with a dead dog in it. The people don't dare to help the monk; they just stand and watch as I save him from the smelly water. The awful odor is easy for me. Still it doesn't mean I don't like the fragrance of flowers.  I know that rotting things attract flies; flowers attract butterflies.  There is no butterfly on the garbage heap.  It has only flies, blue and grey headed flies.
Gold is still gold even when it has fallen into the mud.  The monk has fallen into smelly water; no one dares to approach him since he is not gold. The value of a person is based on the situation.  I help him to his home in the pagoda.....
      Workshop with poets Yin Luoth and Chin Meas, with editor Akhaing Khem

The Impact
Cambodia lags behind the rest of Asia in the development of a modern literature.  This impacts
literacy in the country since without interesting literature there is not much
incentive to read.  The young writers in Vol. 7 are not only the
most promising creative writers in Cambodia today, they are also associated
with a clarity of Khmer writing and editing.  Being published is the best
incentive for young writers to keep mastering their craft.

<h3>About Me/My Project</h3>
<p>Ever since my freshman year of college, way back in the year 2000, I have been composing poetry on many different kinds of subjects. </p>
<p>Back in 2009, I published a short, inexpensive poetry book of these early poems, just to give out to my family and friends. Since then, my style has changed and matured as I have been composing poems on numerous topics and in several different styles. For a few years, I have been saying that I was going to publish these in another book ""someday"", but was never motivated enough to actually save money or seriously pursue this goal.</p>
<p>Recently, after attending a conference by author Donald Miller, I have been inspired to take action and pursue my dream of truly being a published author. </p>
<p>This book is a collection of free verse poetry on topics such as love and its difficulties and victories, solitude/loneliness, God and his love/grace/power to change lives, and the desire for change/security/significance. </p>
<p>I want to publish this book so I can share the words and the gifts God has given me with the world, to fulfill the calling God has given me. I want the words contained in this book to inspire and encourage others and to show that it is possible, with God's power, to triumph over all of the difficulties and struggles that life brings. I am not doing it to get rich--I don't care at all how much money I make. I just want to get my poetry out there to more of the world, no matter what.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>The money you contribute will cover my costs for publishing my book through CreateSpace (a division of Amazon). The least expensive package I can purchase costs $978, and includes the following:</p>
<p>- Custom cover design for the book</p>
<p>- Custom interior design for the book</p>
<p>- An ISBN and barcode</p>
<p>- Book Selling page on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Amazon.com</a> with free search-inside-the-book feature!</p>
<p>- Listings on <a href=""http://amazon.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon.co.uk</a>, Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it and Amazon.es</p>
<p>- Flexible book pricing and royalties</p>
<p>- Royalties paid monthly</p>
<p>Of the additional funds I am requesting, roughly $100 of it will cover the purchase of 50 author's copies of the book (basically books that I would order from Amazon to sell to people in person). </p>
<p>I would also, ideally, like to raise between $139 and $200 more, to purchase either promotional business cards (to hand out to people I meet  at writers' groups/professional meetings/other social events) or for the promotional text creation service (where a<span> professional copywriter shapes the book's key messages into marketing copy designed to suit a variety of purposes). These are not essentials, but I believe they would greatly enhance the saleability of my book.</span></p>
<p>If I don't meet my complete funding goal, any money I receive will be put in a special savings fund for the book, and I will continue to save my own money to add to it until I reach my goal.</p>

<p>Il Comitato Ventotene nasce dall'iniziativa di giovani universitari e lavoratori per offrire una nuova direzione alla vita culturale e politica del paese. La nostra motivazione arriva dal sogno di un’Europa unita e dall'amore per la libertà.</p>
<p>Stiamo organizzando una conferenza per iniziare una collaborazione fra tutte le persone de associazioni  che si riconoscono nell'Europeismo per diffondere sul territorio le idee che porteranno il continente ad affrontare le grandi sfide poste dal nostro tempo e  parlare di rappresentanza dei millennials nelle istituzioni.</p>
<p>I temi trattati saranno:</p>
<p>•Europeismo ed euroscetticismo: l'importanza di una Europa Unita</p>
<p>•TTIP: Opportunità o minaccia?</p>
<p>•Peso politico e rappresentanza dei Millennials in Italia e nel mondo</p>
<p>Il vostro contributo ci aiuterà a realizzare una conferenza a Milano con la migliore copertura social e un' esperienza più coinvolgente per i presenti. Superato l’obiettivo dei 200 euro concentreremo i fondi nell'organizzazione di eventi simili in tutta Italia, e – perché no? - Europa.</p>
<p>La politica è divisa in due schieramenti: europeisti ed antieuropeisti. Da una parte chi vuole essere libero di vedere avverarsi i propri sogni anche in un altro paese, di muoversi senza barriere in un continente di 500 milioni di persone e di sentirsi importante in un mondo sempre più multipolarizzato. Dall’altra chi vuole regredire alla forma ormai superata degli stati-nazione, che porteranno i paesi europei a sparire dallo scacchiere internazionale entro il 2025.</p>
<p>É la nostra generazione che deve affrontare queste sfide. Avremo l’onere di farci carico dell’enorme mole di debito creato dai nostri padri e il dovere di portare avanti il processo di integrazione europea per ritornare ad avere un peso nel mondo.</p>
<p>Se riusciremo a trovare dei punti in comune che possiamo portare avanti con le associazioni trattate, cominceremo da subito una serie di conferenze sul territorio per far conoscere alle persone i vantaggi di un’Europa unita e le opportunità per noi giovani.</p>

<p>I have been writing and publishing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Zine – Wikipedia"">zines</a> for the last ten years. My main publication has been the zine One Way Ticket, of which I have released 7 issues. What began in 2002 as rants and polemics about punk rock and resistance has morphed into tall tales of the triumphs and tragedies of living an anarchist life: hitch-hiking, chance encounters, precarious jobs, student strikes and free food in all its forms. My most recent offering, One Way Ticket #7, was the chronicle of a year spent in Pittsburgh — renovating a collective house and finding adventure in the most unlikely of places. </p>
<p>My zine has regularly received positive reviews from <a href=""http://www.brokenpencilarchive.tuesdayafternoon.net/view.php?id=3423"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Broken Pencil – zine of the month"">Broken Penci</a>l (two times ""zine of the month""), Maximum Rock 'n Roll, Give Me Back and other independent publications. There is an <a href=""http://papertraildossiers.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/interview-with-julian/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Interview by Paper Trail Distro"">interview with me about writing a zine here.</a> At the 2012 <a href=""http://www.kazookazoo.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Kazoo"">Kazoo Zine &amp; Comic Expo</a> in Guelph, Ontario I received the award for ""best zine."" Issue #7 of my zine had a letter-pressed cover that was printed by me on a hand-fed 100 year old printing press in Guelph, Ontario. I was also interviewed on the University of Guelph's campus radio station CFRU for a show called <a href=""http://booksradio.com/2011/10/20/b4b43/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Books for Breakfast – follow link for show archive"">Books for Breakfast</a> in the fall of 2011.</p>
<p>I have up to now photocopied all my zines myself, as well as cutting, assembling, stapling and folding each copy by hand. In many ways this has been a great joy, but spending 6 hours straight watching paper jam after paper jam no longer seems like the best use of my time. I'm putting forward this campaign to secure funds to reprint issue #7 of my zine and print a new issue that is in its final stages of production. I have set a deadline of mid-august for this next issue to be released at the Portland Zine Symposium. I would like to have these zines printed offset rather than photocopying them myself so that I have more time to work on the writing and editing of the new issue. I will also use funds secured for travel expenses associated with attending the <a href=""http://pdxzines.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Portland Zine Symposium"">Portland Zine Symposium</a> and doing a tour of zine readings around coastal BC and Washington State.</p>
<p>Contributions to this project will help the zine achieve a higher and more consistent printed quality, and allow me to work much more on the writing and designing of it, rather than the details of print produciton. Even with a small donation you can help the zine succeed and help me develop as a writer.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need and What You Get</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why Tell Our Stories?</strong></p>
<p>Zines are a way to tell stories that are left out, marginal and dangerous. Telling my stories and encouraging others to do so is why I keep publishing zines and being a part of the zine community. I have had the chance to read my writing in front of some friendly audiences over the past few years, and I always get a tremendous response. I feel that others are truly inspired to create things, to tell their own stories, or to find another outlet to express whatever can't be expressed within the dominant channels of our society.

<p>2 draft novels, 15ish poems, a couple of blogs, and 5-6 short stories later, I consider myself a writer. An unpublished writer, sure, but a writer nonetheless. </p>

<p>I've tried sitting down and writing butt in chair every day. But I need a fierce goal. I need to know that there will be something tangible at the end of the road. I figured that if I did not have worry about the ""if"" or ""when"" of publishing a novel, I can just focus on writing and editing the novel. </p>
<h2>TELL US MORE ABOUT THE NOVEL!</h2>
<p>Right. So there's this ongoing joke with my friends that started when I began to live in one of the most ""interestingly ghetto"" neighborhoods of Montreal, Côte-des-Neiges. Strange things have happened to me here. Very strange people live here. In fact, I was even compelled to sleep on friends' couches for a little while because the thought of crawling back to my dingy hole was the last thing I wanted to do after a night out. Thus the bum chronicles began! </p>
<p>My friends often tell me I should write about those crazy city-life stories. So I thought I would inspire myself from those experiences and write a Trainspotting-like novel.</p>

<p>That's where you come in! I took a long look at how much it would cost to self-publish and self-advertise my own book. And if I could raise at least $5,000, I'll be off to a really good start while I finish writing my novel and get it ready to be published. I am even going to try to coincide being done with the book at the same time as this fundraising campaign ends. Crazy? Yeah, I guess that's one way to describe how I attack personal projects.</p>
<h3>Here's the rough breakdown:</h3>
<p>Self-Publishing Package 4 000,00 $ <br/>Extra Writing/Editing/Publishing Fees 900,00 $ <br/>Costco boxes of ramen noodles to survive on for at least 3 months 100,00 $ <br/>150-book order to pimp out in the streets like a literate hooker 4 000,00 $ <br/>Amazing Book Launch Party 1 000,00 $<br/><br/>TOTAL 10 000,00 $</p>
<p>I know I set my goal to $5,000, but hopefully together we'll be able to raise even more!</p>
<p><img alt=""The Perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/fwixht.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Perks""/></p>
<p>For sure for sure for sure, anyone who donates gets their name printed on a special thank you page in my book. On the right-hand side, you will find even more interesting perks such as thank you cards, a poem, a short story, and more! Plus, it would be interesting if many of you order the poems or the short stories, because they could be a part of another self-publishing project! The Bum Poems. The Bum Short Stories.</p>
<p>My perks range from $5 - $1000, but every dollar helps.</p>

That's where you come in! I took a long look at how much it would cost to self-publish and self-advertise my own book. And if I could raise at least $5,000, I'll be off to a really good start while I finish writing my novel and get it ready to be published. I am even going to try to coincide being done with the book at the same time as this fundraising campaign ends. Crazy? Yeah, I guess that's one way to describe how I attack personal projects.
Here's the rough breakdown:
Self-Publishing Package 4 000,00 $ Extra Writing/Editing/Publishing Fees 900,00 $ Costco boxes of ramen noodles to survive on for at least 3 months 100,00 $ 150-book order to pimp out in the streets like a literate hooker 4 000,00 $ Amazing Book Launch Party 1 000,00 $TOTAL 10 000,00 $
I know I set my goal to $5,000, but hopefully together we'll be able to raise even more!

For sure for sure for sure, anyone who donates gets their name printed on a special thank you page in my book. On the right-hand side, you will find even more interesting perks such as thank you cards, a poem, a short story, and more! Plus, it would be interesting if many of you order the poems or the short stories, because they could be a part of another self-publishing project! The Bum Poems. The Bum Short Stories.
My perks range from $5 - $1000, but every dollar helps.
CHALLENGE ME!



There are many ways to support my weird writing need:

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Lisa Panepinto's debut poetry collection O<i>n This Borrowed Bike</i> was just published by Three Rooms Press.  This indiegogo project is to raise funds for a book tour this spring and summer.</span></h3>
<h3>The Poems</h3>“Simply complex and universally individual, Lisa Panepinto’s poems encompass politics and the soul, nature and the body, paradox and the mind. Panepinto’s voice is so assured and pure, so confident and directed, that to follow it on its intricate and profound journeys can bring serious joy. Far more ambitious than they might at first appear, influenced by Native American, beat, and experimental poetics alike, these are poems that do not shrink from the poet’s oldest task, the mighty healing work of the shaman.”<br/>—<strong>Annie Finch</strong>, <em>Among the Goddesses: An Epic Libretto in Seven Dreams</em><p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>“Lisa Panepinto’s abstract and lyrical vignettes serve as a wonderful introduction to a fresh new voice, bound to rattle the canon.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>—<strong>Patricia Smith</strong>,<i> </i><em style=""font-style: italic;"">Shoulda Been Jimi Savannah</em></p>
<p>“These minimalist and imagistic poems in Lisa Panepinto’s new collection of poetry are woven with the gossamer of crow dreams and water from endangered rivers. In these pages Justice falls in love with the blues. There’s scuffling and dancing, and it’s all coming down to what happens in the dark. There is enough love for everyone. Lisa Panepinto sings. You’ll want to be here.”</p>

<p>As many of you have heard, we in Brooklyn (and its surroundings) are beginning to solidify the Brooklyn Poetry Summit, which will be taking place the weekend of April 18th of the coming year with more than 20 readers from all over the country with poetics both disparate and in close conversation with one another. We are hoping to be able to bring our readers into town without them incurring financial burden, and to help mitigate the financial stress that so often roadblocks meetings of this sort.</p>
<p>The summit's goal is to provide a site for discourse, reading and listening whilst, of course, making similar provisions for partying with much vigor and refinement.   As we are doing our best to stay away from any institutional support while still being able to bring all these poets to town without financial burden, we need support from everyone, especially to adjust for relative distances and financial concerns of our readers .  So...donate, fast, furious, often, oftener...great ""gifts,"" even better future payoff...think of this as your retirement fund. </p>
