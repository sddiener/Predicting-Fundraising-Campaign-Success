<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>The Coaching Educator tackles the college process BEFORE college applications are submitted so that students apply to the best schools for their family’s budget, their own scholarship chances, and their career dreams.  We have a track record of helping all of our students get into colleges and receive scholarships that set them on the right track without going into debt. Our students received over $1,000,000 in scholarships last year, which we think is pretty cool.</p>
<p>We're really proud of our ULTIMATE student programs, but being human means we only have so many hours in a day to guide a limited number of families!  That's why we are creating online, self-guided programs that smart families can use to navigate the process themselves.</p>

<p><strong>How the 9th Annual Black365 Knowledge Bowl Came to Be...</strong></p>
<p>Growing up I thought that African Americans were destined to be one, or all of the following: athletes, drug dealers, gang members or entertainers.  </p>
<p>At the age of 14 I underwent heart surgery, which ended my dreams of ever becoming a basketball star. With more time on my hands because I was not longer practicing, I began to pick up books on Black history. For the first time I saw myself reflected on the pages of world history. I discovered that Black people were more than just athletes, drug dealers, gang members and entertainers - but architects, engineers, astronauts and more.</p>
<p>Inspired by this information, I became my high school's first-ever African American valedictorian, was accepted to eight universities and received approximately $50,000 in scholarships!</p>
<p>The Black365 Knowledge Bowl was created with the intention of being the SPARK that sparks the mind of tomorrow's great leaders! During the Black365 Knowledge Bowl teams of young people challenge one another, and themselves, as they answer 101 questions in world history. This is a jeopardy-style quiz competition, that is fast paced and rewarding for both the young people and the audience...with a positive lasting impact for everyone involved.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Every participant walks away with scholarship money and prizes:</p>
<p>First place: $250 (for all four team members) = $1,000</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Spectracular!  What's that?</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi there!  We’re Jamie and Ben.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jamie is a chemistry professor at Emory &amp; Henry College in southwestern Virginia.  Ben runs The Wolfbird, an interactive multimedia studio in northwestern North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This whole thing is Jamie’s idea.  A few years ago, she came up with Spectracular! - a card game to help her students learn about spectroscopy as part of the organic chemistry classes she teaches at E&amp;H.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jamie approached Ben to help her create a mobile app game version of the paper card game.  After a few initial exploratory design sessions and conversations with Jamie’s students, Ben kept getting more and more excited about the potential for this project to do so many cool things for learning and assessment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585579162/er5owyr7zgr8eztpp3nk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Based on this potential, Jamie and Ben decided to move forward with a project much broader than originally intended.</p>
<h3>The Problems</h3>
<p><strong>Learning about spectroscopy (and how to use it) is difficult</strong> because it requires memorization, understanding, and practice.  You’ve got to memorize lots of information about values, peaks, structural features, and molecules.</p>
<p>You’ve got to understand how spectroscopy works in order to use it to interpret and predict the effects of chemical features on the peaks of spectra, which basically means learning how to read the images generated by spectroscopy.</p>
<p>To get good at this understanding, interpretation, and prediction, you’ve got to practice.  A LOT.</p>
<p><strong>It’s difficult to teach groups of people about spectroscopy (and how to use it)</strong> because it’s difficult to provide individual guidance for understanding and interpretation of all these elements of spectroscopy if you’re just one person teaching in a classroom.</p>
<p>Basically, if you’ve got a lot of students, there are limits on the amount of attention you can give to each student when they need help, and there never seems like there’s enough time to give the help you’d like to give.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of how we learn about spectroscopy is also very difficult. </strong> </p>
<p>When it comes to the card game that Jamie has created, keeping track of what each of the students is doing with the paper card game during class is basically impossible for one person to do, especially when the teacher is trying to give good feedback to every student playing the game, all at the same time.</p>
<p>So, we’ve identified our first set of problems to tackle while we improve this card game and design a mobile app to go with it.  </p>
<p>The game and the app and everything else we’re building along with them represent our first solutions to these problems.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589810520/qvebcjwl6jrqplgtxczd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Solutions</h3>
<p><strong>To improve learning about spectroscopy,</strong> we’re upgrading the paper card game to make it easier to play, so students can focus on learning together, instead of how to play the game.  We’re adding user guides and additional reference materials to ship with the game.</p>
<p>We’re prototyping the mobile app to give students a way to check their own structure matches during a card game, and to challenge the matches of other students with greater confidence.  We’re also building the app to streamline access to specific reference information based on the cards currently on the table.  The app will help students track all the matches they make in class, so they can review them later as many times as they want, linking to interactive step-wise explanatory animations on demand.</p>
<p>We’re building a web dashboard to help students learn more effectively, by tracking their progress with spectroscopy skills as they play the paper card game and use the mobile app inside and outside of class.</p>
<p><strong>To improve teaching about spectroscopy,</strong> we’re making the card game into a turn-key product package that can be downloaded or shipped to any undergraduate chemistry classroom in the country.  We’re adding an instructor guide system to allow any chemistry professor to implement the paper card game into his or her classroom teaching with confidence—and minimal hassle.</p>
<p>We’re extending the expertise of any chemistry professor to give more effective feedback more often to more of his or her students by combining the usefulness of the mobile app and the web dashboard to coordinate what students already understand with what they’re doing in and out of class.  We want to help teachers understand what their students do and don’t understand, and how they can help their students improve their spectroscopy skills in the most meaningful way, working together and separately using the card game and app.  We’re building the web dashboard as a teaching tool to serve these purposes.</p>
<p><strong>To improve the ways we can assess how people learn about spectroscopy,</strong> we’re hybridizing the paper card game with QR codes, which means we can track a lot more about what students are doing with the card game, not to mention send a lot more data their way (through the mobile app) when they need it.  This means we can track what they are doing with the reference materials embedded in the card data.  In fact, the mobile app is designed to increase the precision of how we can track all sorts of ways students are interacting with spectroscopy content and activities as they practice and improve.</p>
<p>One of the intended uses of the web dashboard is to watch how students manage their own learning progress through the knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with spectroscopy so we can better triangulate how we interpret the way they are interacting with the card game and the mobile app.  Along the same lines, the more precise data collected about students’ repeated interactions with on-demand explanatory animations can be linked to how far along they are in their understanding of spectroscopy and how to use it.</p>
<p>We’re treating the way students play the game and use the mobile app as a series of problems to be solved, which means we can apply problem-based learning and assessment design practices to the way we build the game, app, dashboard, explanatory animations, and reference materials.  We’re taking this approach to coordinate the design of our learning outcomes, assessment models, evaluation rubrics, and data protocols.  This way we can map all the data we’ll be gathering so we can better understand what the patterns of data mean for how students are learning spectroscopy within the context of organic chemistry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Everything we do to improve the way we assess students' learning about spectroscopy is intended to improve the ways students learn—and the ways teachers teach—with the card game, app, dashboard, and animations.</i></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This project has the potential to help college and high school students around the world do a better job learning about spectroscopy and many other aspects of organic chemistry.  It has a chance to revolutionize the way we can use digital apps to bridge the gap of personalized assessment inside and outside the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We need your help to get this hybrid card game concept to prototype so we can continue to seek funding and find a software development company to build the full app.</span></p>

</div></div>","Spectracular!  What's that?
Hi there!  We’re Jamie and Ben.
Jamie is a chemistry professor at Emory & Henry College in southwestern Virginia.  Ben runs The Wolfbird, an interactive multimedia studio in northwestern North Carolina.
This whole thing is Jamie’s idea.  A few years ago, she came up with Spectracular! - a card game to help her students learn about spectroscopy as part of the organic chemistry classes she teaches at E&H.
Jamie approached Ben to help her create a mobile app game version of the paper card game.  After a few initial exploratory design sessions and conversations with Jamie’s students, Ben kept getting more and more excited about the potential for this project to do so many cool things for learning and assessment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Based on this potential, Jamie and Ben decided to move forward with a project much broader than originally intended.
The Problems
Learning about spectroscopy (and how to use it) is difficult because it requires memorization, understanding, and practice.  You’ve got to memorize lots of information about values, peaks, structural features, and molecules.
You’ve got to understand how spectroscopy works in order to use it to interpret and predict the effects of chemical features on the peaks of spectra, which basically means learning how to read the images generated by spectroscopy.
To get good at this understanding, interpretation, and prediction, you’ve got to practice.  A LOT.
It’s difficult to teach groups of people about spectroscopy (and how to use it) because it’s difficult to provide individual guidance for understanding and interpretation of all these elements of spectroscopy if you’re just one person teaching in a classroom.
Basically, if you’ve got a lot of students, there are limits on the amount of attention you can give to each student when they need help, and there never seems like there’s enough time to give the help you’d like to give.
Assessment of how we learn about spectroscopy is also very difficult.  
When it comes to the card game that Jamie has created, keeping track of what each of the students is doing with the paper card game during class is basically impossible for one person to do, especially when the teacher is trying to give good feedback to every student playing the game, all at the same time.
So, we’ve identified our first set of problems to tackle while we improve this card game and design a mobile app to go with it.  
The game and the app and everything else we’re building along with them represent our first solutions to these problems.

The Solutions
To improve learning about spectroscopy, we’re upgrading the paper card game to make it easier to play, so students can focus on learning together, instead of how to play the game.  We’re adding user guides and additional reference materials to ship with the game.
We’re prototyping the mobile app to give students a way to check their own structure matches during a card game, and to challenge the matches of other students with greater confidence.  We’re also building the app to streamline access to specific reference information based on the cards currently on the table.  The app will help students track all the matches they make in class, so they can review them later as many times as they want, linking to interactive step-wise explanatory animations on demand.
We’re building a web dashboard to help students learn more effectively, by tracking their progress with spectroscopy skills as they play the paper card game and use the mobile app inside and outside of class.
To improve teaching about spectroscopy, we’re making the card game into a turn-key product package that can be downloaded or shipped to any undergraduate chemistry classroom in the country.  We’re adding an instructor guide system to allow any chemistry professor to implement the paper card game into his or her classroom teaching with confidence—and minimal hassle.
We’re extending the expertise of any chemistry professor to give more effective feedback more often to more of his or her students by combining the usefulness of the mobile app and the web dashboard to coordinate what students already understand with what they’re doing in and out of class.  We want to help teachers understand what their students do and don’t understand, and how they can help their students improve their spectroscopy skills in the most meaningful way, working together and separately using the card game and app.  We’re building the web dashboard as a teaching tool to serve these purposes.
To improve the ways we can assess how people learn about spectroscopy, we’re hybridizing the paper card game with QR codes, which means we can track a lot more about what students are doing with the card game, not to mention send a lot more data their way (through the mobile app) when they need it.  This means we can track what they are doing with the reference materials embedded in the card data.  In fact, the mobile app is designed to increase the precision of how we can track all sorts of ways students are interacting with spectroscopy content and activities as they practice and improve.
One of the intended uses of the web dashboard is to watch how students manage their own learning progress through the knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with spectroscopy so we can better triangulate how we interpret the way they are interacting with the card game and the mobile app.  Along the same lines, the more precise data collected about students’ repeated interactions with on-demand explanatory animations can be linked to how far along they are in their understanding of spectroscopy and how to use it.
We’re treating the way students play the game and use the mobile app as a series of problems to be solved, which means we can apply problem-based learning and assessment design practices to the way we build the game, app, dashboard, explanatory animations, and reference materials.  We’re taking this approach to coordinate the design of our learning outcomes, assessment models, evaluation rubrics, and data protocols.  This way we can map all the data we’ll be gathering so we can better understand what the patterns of data mean for how students are learning spectroscopy within the context of organic chemistry.
Everything we do to improve the way we assess students' learning about spectroscopy is intended to improve the ways students learn—and the ways teachers teach—with the card game, app, dashboard, and animations.

This project has the potential to help college and high school students around the world do a better job learning about spectroscopy and many other aspects of organic chemistry.  It has a chance to revolutionize the way we can use digital apps to bridge the gap of personalized assessment inside and outside the classroom.
We need your help to get this hybrid card game concept to prototype so we can continue to seek funding and find a software development company to build the full app.
The Big Ask...
For this campaign, we’re raising $20,000.
Based on an educational discount rate $20,000 will give us five months of focused design and production time for the initial deliverables of the Spectracular! prototype, which include:

A polished card game ready for turnkey classroom use (as deck packs and print-on-demand PDF files) including functional QR codes for hybrid experiences
A clickable app prototype on tablets and smartphones
A web dashboard prototype (for managing learning and assessment)
Learning and assessment design (such as learning outcomes, assessment models, rubrics, data protocols, and ancillary materials such as instructor guides and user help files)
Explanatory stepwise diagrammatic animations (storyboarded and produced)
Research Plan  (including hypothesis development, an experimental design roadmap, and a timeline for scalable research implementation with targeted learning audiences)
Development ready design-documentation package for the purpose of soliciting proposals from leading software development firms


Check our website for a more detailed overview about the deliverables for this phase of the Spectracular! project.  We'll also be releasing update posts throughout this campaign.
The overarching goal of this phase of the project (and its deliverables) is to position our team to gather the evidence we need (by piloting the paper card game along with the app and dashboard prototypes) to seek additional funding from foundations and government organizations such as the National Science Foundation.
WHAT IF WE DON'T MAKE IT?
If we don’t reach our goal, whatever funds we do raise will go toward as many months of prototype development as possible.  We will prioritize our deliverables based on any revised budget that may result from this shortcoming.
What's in it for me?

We’ve got some of the typical perks, like t-shirts and coffee mugs, and a nice handwritten thank you letter, but we think some of our perks are really unique!


SPONSOR A STUDENT: This is particularly cool.  You get to ensure that, somewhere in the world, a college student gets to use this card game and app to improve his or her spectroscopy skills.

<p>Organizing such a festival requires a lot of work and dedication. To
bring diversity in the programme we made countless of calls, sent tons of
emails, made many meetings and hours of conversations. There are more than 10 authors from Bulgaria, Europe and the USA, involved there are the best actors from the local theatre scene to bring the texts to life. But it's not only about the readings, we have also concerts, performances, workshops and rich programme for kids. And there is much more to see. But at the very
last moment we got a refusal from one of our main
sponsors. Now we will have to cut most of the festivals events.</p>
<p>Here we come to you - the Indiegogo
community. We turn to each of you - writers and translators, artists
and actors, fans of writing and listening, everyone who is in love with literature - help us to make it happen!

</p>
<p>With your support we’ll be able to keep all the
planned events in the programme. But that’s only on the surface. By giving our authors and artists hope
that their work is worthy you make difference. Uniting with our
festival participants you help them and help us in our efforts to spread the art of
writing and storytelling.</p>

What is even worst - there is a danger to lose our most precious audience - young people who just started visiting the festival's events more often.

<h3><b>За тази кампания и защо сме тук</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Тази кампания е за спасяването на осмия Международен
литературен фестивал в Русе, който нашият екип от Международно Дружество “Елиас
Канети” организира всяка есен. Можете да научите повече за дружеството и
издателската ни къща в нашия сайт, вижте най-долу на тази страница. Предприехме тази
камания за да ви запознаем
с Литературния фестивал и ситуацията,
пред която сме изправени. Фестивалът започна преди години, като малък литературен салон, главно
с литературни четения,
дискусии и скромна публика. Днес Литературенен Салон е вече Международен Литературен
Фестивал, чието осмо издание предстои съвсем скоро. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443001710/lsvdngs6g3zxeziw4v6m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Днешната програма на
фестивала е симбиоза между различни изкуства, малко или много свързани с литературата, а събитията
събират разнообразна публика без ограничения във възрастта - от най-малките до
най-големите. </p>

<br/>През годините, наши гости бяха някои
от най-добрите български и европейски автори, можем да посочим имена като <b>Илия</b> <b>Троянов, Калин Терзийски, Роберт Шиндел, Марк Дегенс, Ирис Ханика, Мартин Рушави, Христине Хубер </b>и много други.<b></b> Някои автори и
техните произведения направиха своя дебют чрез нашата издателска къща. Но това,
което ни прави истински щастливи е, че стъпка
по стъпка, успяхме да привлечем вниманието на най-ценната аудитория - децата.
През последните две издания на фестивала сме свидетели на все по-силен интерес от страна
на млади хора, някои от които пътуват до Русе,
за да видят фестивалните събития. Към тях се отнасяме с особено внимание.<p><strike></strike></p>

<br/>
<p>Организирането на
такъв фестивал изисква много труд и всеотдайност. За да направим разнообразна фестивалната
програмата проведохме безброй разговори, изпратихме тонове имейли, направихме
много срещи и лични разговори. За тазгодишното издание успяхме да поканим над десет автори от България,
Европа и САЩ, ангажирахме най-добрите актьори от местната театрална сцена, които
да дадат живот на представяните текстове. Предвидили сме спектакли, семинари и събития
за деца. Но в последния момент получихме отказ
от един от нашите основни спонсори. Това налага да свалим почти половината
от фестивалните събития. Иронично, но сред тях са главно българските гости и
участия, по причина, че пътуванията на повечето външни участници са уредени
предварително. Настоящият бюджет не ни позволява да заплатим за всички
планирани събития, налага се промяна в програмата, която ще трябва да
вместим в по-малко на брой дни. </p>
<p>Това е причината да
стартираме тази кампания. Обръщаме се към всеки един от вас - писатели и
преводачи, артисти и актьори, ценители на литературата във всичките и форми -
заедно да спасим тазгодишното издание на фестивала! Имаме нужда от всестранна
подкрепа. Ако това е и Ваша кауза - прегледайте предложенията ни в дясно и

<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b>От какво имаме нужда и какво предлагаме в замяна на помощта Ви </b></h3></b></b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Сега ние усилено
работим върху следващото, осмо издание на фестивала. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">За да направим
нещата ясни финансово,
сме разделени бюджета на четири основни части:</span></p>
<p>- транспорт и
настаняване</p>
<p>- хонорари на
участници</p>
<p>- организация на
събития и офис разходи</p>
<p>- създаване и
поддръжка на кампанията (възложили сме това на външен екип) такси и отчисления
от страна на Indiegogo.com, включително разходи по подготовка и транспорт на
пратки, такси за банкови преводи (доколкото сме в състояние да ги предвидим) и
т.н.</p>
<p>Като компенсация за
подкрепата Ви предлагаме интересни продукти и услуги, които са достъпни само и
единствено сега, през периода на кампанията. </p>
<p>Само в периода на тази кампания е възможно да се поръча първото двуезично издание на
нашето издателство - поетичната творба <i><b>Ъгли и овали</b> на Румяна Еберт</i>, където тя разглежда връзката между наука и поезия. Книгата съдържа целия превод, на български и немски език, и ще нейната премиера ще бъде на Литературен Фестивал Русе 2015. Все още е в печат, а Вие имате
шанс да притежавате копие от първия тираж, подписано лично от авторката,
която ще бъде и гост на фестивала. </p>
<p>Имаме и други вълнуващи предложения - за
автори, професионално занимаващи се с литература предлагаме в ограничено количество уникална услуга - професионален превод на Ваш авторски текст. Като издателсво ние работим с високо квалифицирани и признати преводачи, които ще направят за вас превод от/към български и немски, от/към български и английски език. Скоро предстои да добавим френски, италиански и португалски езици, абонирайте се за нашите новини за да научите първи за това. </p>
<p>За да отбележим годината на Елиас Канети (научете повече за това в нашия сайт) предлагаме само тук нашият <b>Специален Пакет</b>, съдържащ две от неговите забележителни творби - <b><i>Слуховидецът</i></b> и <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><i>ЗАПИСКИ 1942 - 1985.

отива при всички писатели, поети, артисти, тези, които създават или работят с
текст, без значение дали са били наши гости в предишните издания на фестивала
или  предстои да бъдат в бъдещите.
Помагайки на създателите,
вие помагате и на техните фенове да поддържат интереса си жив и да разпространяват
изкуството на писането, което прави тази общност все по-голяма и по-силна.
Всичко това помага и на нас, организаторите, да преследваме най-високата си цел
- да обогатяваме постоянно фестивалната програма със събития, които включват
все по-млада аудитория - в това
полагаме особени усилия. Стремим се да инвестираме все повече в културата на
нашите деца и каним и Вас да ни последвате.</p>

<h3><b>Рискове и предизвикателства</b></h3></b></b><p></p>
<p>Ако не упеем да
съберем търсената сума,
ще бъдем принудени да отменим някои от най-интересните събития и вълнуващи
гости. За съжаление повечето от тях са наши, бълграски автори и артисти, с
които финансовите дела се уреждат по-лесно (с оглед на предварително заплащане на разходи по
транспорт и т.н). Разбирате, че най-скъпите проекти ще се наложи да отложим,
вероятно за следващото издание на фестивала през 2016-та г. Това означава, че
нямаме гаранция дали авторите ще са свободни и т.н. Драстично намаления бюджет
със сигурност ще доведе до промяна и разместване в програмата, което ще предизвика
объркване в публиката и особено у медиите. Въпреки всичко, фестивал ще има.
<span><br/></span>Най-лошото е опасността да загубим интереса на най-ценната ни аудитория -
младите хора. В техните очи това ще е стъпка назад в стремежа ни да се
противопоставяме на масовата култура, оставяйки я да поеме кормилото. Ние не
искаме това, вярваме, че и Вие не го искате. </p>
<p>А ако успеем да надхвърлим търсената сума, събраните над нея средства ще отидат за организация на следващия фестивал, имаме много нови идеи, които бихме искали да развием за следващото издание.</p>

желанието си да помогне. Има много начини да допринесете за каузата –
споделяйте тази кампания сред приятели, социалните мрежи ще са изключително

 Our Story 







Before continue reading the main story please note that the festival will be launched while the campaign is still active. We realize the risk of running the event without any guarantee that we will reach our financial goal. Do not let that bother you - we negotiate with our participants ways for
 deferred payment of honorariums and travels. 
It is particularly important to receive strong support in the first days - this will give us confidence and greater security when talking with our guests.
The aim of this campaign is to collect the necessary amount, but not at any price to make payments in advance. We should not lose any of the events of the festival program.


This campaign is about saving the 8th International Literature Festival in Ruse, 
Bulgaria. The festival is organized by International Elias Canetti Society. You can learn more about our organization and publishing house
 on our web site link below. 


This is to present you our Literature 
festival and the unpleasant situation we are facing now, days before the festival start. 


The today's festival started years ago as a small literature salon. We are now approaching its eight edition and it's programme now takes more than a 
week. 




It now includes literature readings and books 
presentations, concerts, performances, workshops and many more. The 
festival incorporates all kind of arts connected in any way to literature.

Trough the years we had some of the best local and European 
authors presenting their works. Amongst them are Iliya Troyanov, Kalin Terziyski, Robert Schindel, Mark Degens, Iris Hanika, Martin Ryšavý, Christine Huber and many more. Trough our publishing house we made it possible for some authors to make their debut on the scene. But what 
makes us really happy - step by step we attracted the attention of the 
most precious audience - the kids. Last two years we are happy to see 
their interest in the festival events growing even stronger. This is 
where we invest most of all - we do care about our children's future as we rely on 
them to become tomorrow's big thinkers and movers.

   

Organizing such a festival requires a lot of work and dedication. To
bring diversity in the programme we made countless of calls, sent tons of
emails, made many meetings and hours of conversations. There are more than 10 authors from Bulgaria, Europe and the USA, involved there are the best actors from the local theatre scene to bring the texts to life. But it's not only about the readings, we have also concerts, performances, workshops and rich programme for kids. And there is much more to see. But at the very
last moment we got a refusal from one of our main
sponsors. Now we will have to cut most of the festivals events.
Here we come to you - the Indiegogo
community. We turn to each of you - writers and translators, artists
and actors, fans of writing and listening, everyone who is in love with literature - help us to make it happen!


With your support we’ll be able to keep all the
planned events in the programme. But that’s only on the surface. By giving our authors and artists hope
that their work is worthy you make difference. Uniting with our
festival participants you help them and help us in our efforts to spread the art of
writing and storytelling.
   What We Need & What You Get

Now we are hard working on the next, eight
edition of the festival. To make financial things clear we divided the budget on four main parts:


- 
transportation and accommodation
-  authors/artists fees
-  events organization & office
expenses
-  campaign development and
support/campaign expenses and taxes, including bank transfer fees etc. 
For all your support we
have worked out some exciting perks you can choose from. It is only here, during the Indiegogo campaign, when you can preorder the latest addition to our book family, just sent to the printing house. Only now you have the chance to have a copy from the first run, signed by Rumiana Ebert, the author herself. She connects science and poetry in
her poetry book Corners and Ovals, which will have its world premiere on the festival. 
For those into professional writing we offer the unique limited quantity perk - translation of your own text. As a Publishing house we work with some of the best highly professional native speaker translators on the market. Thanks to them we now offer high quality translation of your text to/from German and Bulgarian. Other language options are to/from English and Bulgarian, soon we'll be able to offer perks also in French, Italian and Portuguese. Subscribe for our updates to be the first to know when they are available.
To celebrate the Elias Canetti year (learn about this on our web site) we offer very Special Pack consisting of two of his most remarkable works - Earwitness and Notes 1942 - 1985, The Human Province / The Secret Heart of
the Clock, which came out in 2015, thanks to the Elias Canetti publishing house, and will be presented
for the very first time at the Festival. 





These are only some of the rewards we offer for your help, check them all for details. For those wishинг to support the festival in any amount, but would not want to benefit from our products and services, see the bottom of the column.
By choosing a perk you become one of our precious supporters for years to
come, because, if we make it to fulfill the festival's 2015 programme, it will
be much easier do it for the next 2016th. 



The Impact 

Our cause is to prevent mass culture to spread over the real valuables in life. This campaign benefits all
writers, poets, artists and everyone ever working with a written text no matter
if it was attending our festival or we are still haven’t heard about him/her.
This extends to their fans and lovers, makes this community bigger and
stronger. 
Our highest goal is to make the festivals programme richer with
events involving younger audiences – this is where we put our bigger efforts.
We do care about today’s kids becoming tomorrow’s thinkers and movers. This is
where we invest and we invite you to do so/the same.



Risks & Challenges  If we don’t reach our goal we’ll be forced to cancel some of the most interesting events and exciting guests. You understand that the most expensive projects will have to be put on hold, probably for the next year’s edition. This will definitely cause a programme shift which will bring confusion in the audience and especially media. Still, we will produce the festival but it won’t be better than the previous one. What is even worst - there is a danger to lose our most precious audience - young people who just started visiting the festival's events more often. In their eyes this will make us looking like we are giving up, thus letting the mass culture to take over the rudder. We don't want this, we believe you don't want it too.
But if we get really huge support and we exceed the amount requested, the excessive funds will go towards organization of the next festival as there are many new ideas we are keen to offer you.

Преди да продължите да четете основния текст, бихме искали да Ви обърнем внимание, че фестивалът ще стартира докато кампанията е все още активна. Осъзнаваме рискът от това, да стартираме събитието преди да сме сигурни, че ще съберем необходимата сума, но фестивалните дати вече бяха планирани и бе невъзможно да се променят. Нека то­ва не Ви притеснява - ние уреждаме с нашите участници начини за отложено плащане на хонорари и пътувания. 
Особено важно е да получим силна подкрепа още в първите дни - това ще ни даде увереност и по-голяма сигурност в разговорите си с тях. 
Целта на тази кампания е да съберем нужната сума, но не на всяка цена да направим плащанията предварително. Не трябва да губим нито едно от събитията от фестивалната програма.

литературен фестивал в Русе, който нашият екип от Международно Дружество “Елиас

изберете свой начин да се включите. С Ваша помощ ние правим Фестивалът възможен.



От какво имаме нужда и какво предлагаме в замяна на помощта Ви 

Сега ние усилено
работим върху следващото, осмо издание на фестивала. За да направим
нещата ясни финансово,
сме разделени бюджета на четири основни части:
- транспорт и
настаняване
- хонорари на
участници
- организация на
събития и офис разходи
- създаване и
поддръжка на кампанията (възложили сме това на външен екип) такси и отчисления
от страна на Indiegogo.com, включително разходи по подготовка и транспорт на
пратки, такси за банкови преводи (доколкото сме в състояние да ги предвидим) и
т.н.
Като компенсация за
подкрепата Ви предлагаме интересни продукти и услуги, които са достъпни само и
единствено сега, през периода на кампанията. 
Само в периода на тази кампания е възможно да се поръча първото двуезично издание на
нашето издателство - поетичната творба Ъгли и овали на Румяна Еберт, където тя разглежда връзката между наука и поезия. Книгата съдържа целия превод, на български и немски език, и ще нейната премиера ще бъде на Литературен Фестивал Русе 2015. Все още е в печат, а Вие имате
шанс да притежавате копие от първия тираж, подписано лично от авторката,
която ще бъде и гост на фестивала. 
Имаме и други вълнуващи предложения - за
автори, професионално занимаващи се с литература предлагаме в ограничено количество уникална услуга - професионален превод на Ваш авторски текст. Като издателсво ние работим с високо квалифицирани и признати преводачи, които ще направят за вас превод от/към български и немски, от/към български и английски език. Скоро предстои да добавим френски, италиански и португалски езици, абонирайте се за нашите новини за да научите първи за това. 
За да отбележим годината на Елиас Канети (научете повече за това в нашия сайт) предлагаме само тук нашият Специален Пакет, съдържащ две от неговите забележителни творби - Слуховидецът и ЗАПИСКИ 1942 - 1985. Провинцията на човека / Тайното
сърце на часовника, издадена през 2015 г. от издателска къща „Елиас Канети“ и ще бъде представена
за първи път по време на фестивала. 







Това са само някои от начините да изразим благодарността си за помощта, която ни оказвате, Поръчвайки някой от нашите предложения вие на практика инвестирате в бъдещето на Литературен Фестивал Русе. Успеем ли да го реализираме тази година, това ще улесни и гаратира успеха на следващите издания. 
За да изберете своя начин да помогнете разгледайте
колконката в дясно и направете своя избор. За тези, които
желаят да подкрепят фестивала с произволна сума, но не биха искали да се
възползват от продуктите и услугите ни вижте най-долу в колонката.



Смисълът и ползата от вашата помощ


Реалната помощ
отива при всички писатели, поети, артисти, тези, които създават или работят с
текст, без значение дали са били наши гости в предишните издания на фестивала
или  предстои да бъдат в бъдещите.
Помагайки на създателите,
вие помагате и на техните фенове да поддържат интереса си жив и да разпространяват
изкуството на писането, което прави тази общност все по-голяма и по-силна.
Всичко това помага и на нас, организаторите, да преследваме най-високата си цел
- да обогатяваме постоянно фестивалната програма със събития, които включват
все по-млада аудитория - в това
полагаме особени усилия. Стремим се да инвестираме все повече в културата на
нашите деца и каним и Вас да ни последвате.



Рискове и предизвикателства
Ако не упеем да
съберем търсената сума,
ще бъдем принудени да отменим някои от най-интересните събития и вълнуващи
гости. За съжаление повечето от тях са наши, бълграски автори и артисти, с
които финансовите дела се уреждат по-лесно (с оглед на предварително заплащане на разходи по
транспорт и т.н). Разбирате, че най-скъпите проекти ще се наложи да отложим,
вероятно за следващото издание на фестивала през 2016-та г. Това означава, че
нямаме гаранция дали авторите ще са свободни и т.н. Драстично намаления бюджет
със сигурност ще доведе до промяна и разместване в програмата, което ще предизвика
объркване в публиката и особено у медиите. Въпреки всичко, фестивал ще има.
Най-лошото е опасността да загубим интереса на най-ценната ни аудитория -
младите хора. В техните очи това ще е стъпка назад в стремежа ни да се
противопоставяме на масовата култура, оставяйки я да поеме кормилото. Ние не
искаме това, вярваме, че и Вие не го искате. 
А ако успеем да надхвърлим търсената сума, събраните над нея средства ще отидат за организация на следващия фестивал, имаме много нови идеи, които бихме искали да развием за следващото издание.





Други начини да помогнете

Знаем, че не вски би могъл да отдели сума, въпреки
желанието си да помогне. Има много начини да допринесете за каузата –
споделяйте тази кампания сред приятели, социалните мрежи ще са изключително
полезни да разпространите нашите видеа, снимки и материали, които ще
публикуваме през периода на кампанията. Заявете своята позиция и станете посланик
на идеята, ние ще Ви възнаградим за това, абонирайте и следете за новини.
Благодарим за
отделеното време, ако имате въпроси, вижте как може да се свържете с нас в секция “Контакти”.

</div></div>","Hello Everyone! I am part of the TuaRes team. TuaRes endeavors to promote education among girls in Burkina Faso constructing a solid support network for children and their families. 
In this context we are launching our Sunshine Project! for English learning. In French speaking Burkina Faso, knowledge of English will provide girls with an invaluable skill that will significantly increase their future job opportunities. Indeed, the ability to speak English proficiently is rare and sought after.
Learning English will also strengthen girls' confidence and for this reason we speak of The Sunshine Project! It owes its name to our belief that education will brighten the minds and lives of young girls giving them the tools to create a better future. 


Girls' Education in Burkina Faso


In Burkina Faso,
one of the poorest countries in the world, only
42% of girls finish elementary school and female literacy stands at just 33.1%. The reasons are both economic and cultural. Household and family conditions are tough as girls have to perform lengthy daily chores at home during the school week. In addition, many girls must face challenges such as early pregnancies, forced marriage, child abuse and child
labor, health problems, particularly eye sight problems, and limited access to health
care.




The challenges to female education are linked to poverty as well as to attitudes and
practices rooted in patriarchal traditions and social norms. From an early
age, girls are taught that they have different roles and responsibilities from
boys and that their priority is to attend to household duties. Such a
projection of gender-restrictive roles is reinforced by their extended family, their school, their church or mosque, their wider
community and the media. In poor rural communities,
many girls go from being economically dependent on their fathers, to being
economically dependent on their husbands. Even in the case of orphanage, the
girls’ guardians will try to secure a profitable marriage as soon as possible

<p></p>
<p>This campaign is an initiative through which we plan to impact 1000 students. I am a first class graduate of University of Lagos, and a two-time <a href=""http://bncmedia.org/about-the-author/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Best Graduating Student</a>. </p>
<p>I here appeal to you to support my personal social responsibility programme, which is to embark on school outreaches and teach the principles that helped me succeed. We need you to support the distribution of free copies of <a href=""http://bncmedia.org/about-the-book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Secrets of Best Graduating Students</a>. This great book is a joint effort of <a href=""http://bncmedia.org/about-the-book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">11 Best Graduating Students</a> and First Class Students; it is rich in academic excellence strategies. The manner of its presentation is also novel - it contains commentaries, quotes, pictures and social media smileys. That is why it connects very much with its audience from front cover to back page, and from our survey, it would deliver the needed impact.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

What we are giving back to you does not in any way compare with what you are giving for this project, but we know that the hearts of the recipients will bless you.

<h3>The Impact of the Project</h3>
<p>Obviously, from this project, 1000 students will get free copies of The Secrets of Best Graduating Students. But in addition, this project is sure to have a great educational impact; more Nigerians would be better informed about their career choices from a deeper self-awareness, take ownership of their education and be more excellent in their academics.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The risks here is that if we are unable to raise the needed $5,000 sum, the publishing and book launch may be delayed. If we eventually source the balance of the money from a financial institution, we may end up giving out just the number of copies that the funds from this crowdfunding campaign would cover. In other words, we may give less that 1000 copies. But we promise you that every copy you pay for will get to the recipient, and you will get proof for it. We also promise you that we will fulfill our perks to each sponsor, whether or not we reach our goal.<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways We Can Help Each Other</h3>
<p>We will also be pleased if you help us spread the word about this campaign. This platform (indiegogo) has tools to make sharing very easy. Please use them to help us reach more people. </p>
<p>If you’re running a similar campaign in your country, we’d be glad to support you in any way possible. If it is a programme or school outreach, we could handle sessions on academic excellence for you. If you are interested in the book, we can also make it available to you at a discounted rate. Just feel free to let us know how we can be of help, and we’ll see how to work it out.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and anticipated support. You can ask us questions through any of the channels on this page, and we will be glad to respond to them all.</p>

<h2><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Summer isn't fun for everyone.</b></h2>
<div>Across America, kids everywhere, are knee deep into their summer fun. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Thoughts of summer break still bring back wonderful memories for me.  Lazy days hanging with friends and riding bikes around town or swimming at the local pool made memories that will be with me for a lifetime.  Whether playing baseball, fishing or hiding out in our fort in the woods across by day and catching lightening bugs at night there was always something fun to do in our small town.</span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">But particularly exciting for me was the freedom to cook and eat what we wanted while our parents were working.  Whether raiding my mothers pantry to make a batch of chocolate chip cookies or </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">riding our bikes down to the local grocery store to buy something to cook up, food was a big part of our summer break. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>Sadly enough summer isn't so much fun for far too many kids across America. Here in Southern California it is particularly rough.  One would think that living in SoCal, so close to the ocean, that summer would be a blast.  That's just not the case for so many.  Summer is a challenging time for so many parents and their kids.  Without the government subsidized school lunch program far too many parents and kids struggle just to eat.  As a child it is pretty hard to enjoy summer when your stomach is so often empty.</div>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">During the devastating economic recession that began in 2008, I watched a lot of good people lose
their jobs at a time when there were no jobs to be found.  In the process I watched honest hardworking
people struggle just to put a meal on their table and pay
their rent.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Then the unthinkable happened

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I got involved in
a variety of nonprofit programs, including volunteering at the Orange County Rescue
Mission as a regular guest chef.  It was my
work at the mission that reconfirmed my concerns about the significant levels
of food insecurity that exist in Orange County, and I set about to make a
difference and feed the hungry.  It was there that I also realized just how much work is needed in America, to change how we feed and support the poor among us. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Why Bracken's Kitchen</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Surely we can find a better way to feed the hungry and under served in our communities.</b>  How long will we continue to hand out processed, boxed, canned and dry food products that are laden with all the stuff that leads to obesity, diabetes and long term health issues. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The warehouse/food bank model of feeding the poor has served us well for decades but surely we can do better.  </span></p>
<blockquote><b>""A tasty and nutritious meal should not be a luxury available only to the well off in America in 2016,"" </b></blockquote>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I was determined to open a
restaurant to help address the problems and wrote our business plan.  But I quickly realized that hunger in Orange County
has its own set of challenges, not the least of which included a primary concern
of reaching food insecure families and children distributed over a broad geographic
area.  People without resources who are already
stretched thin are unable to travel regularly and over distances, even in
pursuit of the nutritious meals that I wanted to provide.  I came to the conclusion that the answer
could be found in the trendy new rebirth of an age-old business:  mobile food trucks.  If the people could not come to me, I would
bring the food to the them.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>And thus in
March 2013 Bracken’s Kitchen was born</b>. 
It has been almost 2 years since Betsy, our big red food truck showed up
in our driveway thanks to Bruce Hecker of <a href=""http://brucescatering.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Bruce’s Catering</b></a> and she and I have
been very busy ever since.  We travel
throughout Orange County regularly feeding tasty and nutritious meals to those
who need it most. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As a professional
chef I have always believed in the power of food, however, over the past 18
months that has come to have a whole new meaning.  As humans we all share two of the most fundamental

</div></div>","Summer isn't fun for everyone.
Across America, kids everywhere, are knee deep into their summer fun. Thoughts of summer break still bring back wonderful memories for me.  Lazy days hanging with friends and riding bikes around town or swimming at the local pool made memories that will be with me for a lifetime.  Whether playing baseball, fishing or hiding out in our fort in the woods across by day and catching lightening bugs at night there was always something fun to do in our small town.


But particularly exciting for me was the freedom to cook and eat what we wanted while our parents were working.  Whether raiding my mothers pantry to make a batch of chocolate chip cookies or riding our bikes down to the local grocery store to buy something to cook up, food was a big part of our summer break. 

Sadly enough summer isn't so much fun for far too many kids across America. Here in Southern California it is particularly rough.  One would think that living in SoCal, so close to the ocean, that summer would be a blast.  That's just not the case for so many.  Summer is a challenging time for so many parents and their kids.  Without the government subsidized school lunch program far too many parents and kids struggle just to eat.  As a child it is pretty hard to enjoy summer when your stomach is so often empty.


49% of all school aged kids in Orange County are on the free and reduced lunch plan. In LA County the figure is 58%.

1 in 5 kids are hungry in Orange County, a problem that is worsened when the government subsidized school lunch programs are not available during the summer months.

There are nearly 400,000 people at risk for hunger every month in Orange County, a region known for wealth and opulence.


Hunger strikes individuals, families with children, the elderly and the poor.


In a county where housing costs are among the highest in the nation, a full-time job does not guarantee that a family will be able to make ends meet.


Low income people have to make the difficult choices between food and other life necessities such as rent or health care on a regular basis. 


It is the middle of summer and school is out, what are these children eating tonight?

                               
With so much demand this summer you can help us keep Betsy rolling and our ovens full of food for those who need it most.

Meet Betsy & Bill:
Hello, my name is Bill Bracken, a professional chef with more than 35 years of experience in the hospitality industry.  After graduating with honors from the Culinary Institute of America, I began what was to be a long and successful career with a number of acclaimed luxury hotels and restaurants including the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. 
During the devastating economic recession that began in 2008, I watched a lot of good people lose
their jobs at a time when there were no jobs to be found.  In the process I watched honest hardworking
people struggle just to put a meal on their table and pay
their rent.  
Then the unthinkable happened
and in December of 2011 I too lost my job. 
As a man of faith I knew then that I was being called to find a way to leverage my talent
and skills to help those who were struggling.

                                    
I got involved in
a variety of nonprofit programs, including volunteering at the Orange County Rescue
Mission as a regular guest chef.  It was my
work at the mission that reconfirmed my concerns about the significant levels
of food insecurity that exist in Orange County, and I set about to make a
difference and feed the hungry.  It was there that I also realized just how much work is needed in America, to change how we feed and support the poor among us. 

Why Bracken's Kitchen
Surely we can find a better way to feed the hungry and under served in our communities.  How long will we continue to hand out processed, boxed, canned and dry food products that are laden with all the stuff that leads to obesity, diabetes and long term health issues. The warehouse/food bank model of feeding the poor has served us well for decades but surely we can do better.  
""A tasty and nutritious meal should not be a luxury available only to the well off in America in 2016,"" 
I was determined to open a
restaurant to help address the problems and wrote our business plan.  But I quickly realized that hunger in Orange County
has its own set of challenges, not the least of which included a primary concern
of reaching food insecure families and children distributed over a broad geographic
area.  People without resources who are already
stretched thin are unable to travel regularly and over distances, even in
pursuit of the nutritious meals that I wanted to provide.  I came to the conclusion that the answer
could be found in the trendy new rebirth of an age-old business:  mobile food trucks.  If the people could not come to me, I would
bring the food to the them.  
And thus in
March 2013 Bracken’s Kitchen was born. 
It has been almost 2 years since Betsy, our big red food truck showed up
in our driveway thanks to Bruce Hecker of Bruce’s Catering and she and I have
been very busy ever since.  We travel
throughout Orange County regularly feeding tasty and nutritious meals to those
who need it most. 
As a professional
chef I have always believed in the power of food, however, over the past 18
months that has come to have a whole new meaning.  As humans we all share two of the most fundamental
and basic of needs, the need to breath and the need to eat.  The problem is that air is free and food it
not.   It is that very fact that gives food such power.  I have seen how food truly brings people
together in amazing ways.  I believe
there is no better way to intimately get to know a person than by sharing a meal
with them.


Our Culinary Trio
While feeding people is a noble and necessary, we quickly realized that we need to find a way to
have a more lasting impact on a person's life and help break the cycle of
poverty.  And with that our Trio of
Services was born. We have expanded on
our “Food Truck Feeding Program” and recently launched our “Recovered Food
Program” partnering with the “Chefs To End Hunger” initiative introduced by LA
Specialty Produce Company.  They have put
together a very simple yet effective way to allow hotels and restaurants to donate
their high quality left over food items. 
We are honored to work with them taking these left over products and
turning them into more nutritious and tasty meals.
                                             

""No child should ever have to go to bed hungry in America.""  



What's next?

As we move forward we are excited to introduce our culinary training program for at risk youth, especially those who have aged out of the foster system. In offering a foundation of culinary training we will offer young people living in poverty the chance for skilled jobs in our industry and a life outside the grip of poverty.
 You can help...It takes the time, talent and treasures of a lot of caring people to truly make a difference in the lives of those who need us most. We need your help to make that difference.  We are working towards self sufficiency and to that end have launched ""Catering For a Cause"".  It is our way of putting our talents to work not only feeding those in need but ensuring we will be able to do so for years to com.  But we are not there yet and hope that you will help us as we continue to feed the need.  From food supplies, to cleaning and paper supplies as well as gas and oil for Betsy, it all costs money.  We are proud to have achieved an average dinner cost of just under 50 cents.  That's right, just 1 dollar will provide the food for a tasty and nutritious dinner for 2 people. Help Us Feed a Family This Summer We know that the list of wonderful people and organizations asking  for your support is endless.  With over 30 years of experience in leading and running some of the top hotels in Southern California you can rest assured of the experience that Chef Bracken  brings to the table.  
We take the stewardship of your donations very serious and will do our very best to honor your support in how we run our organization.  We do hope you will consider helping us feed the need here in Southern California and eventually beyond. 
If you are not in a position to help us financially there are many other ways you can be of support.  If you are in the local area you can offer your time and talent to help keep us moving.  If not please help us spread the word through this campaign and our social media outlets.  We do hope that you will agree with us that nutritious food, one of the basic necessities of life, should not be a luxury only for the wealthy.

This one does not begin in Silicon Valley. Here's your chance to CONTRIBUTE to the launching of the world's first Digital Ecosystem designed to empower those creative geniuses such as Musicians, Moviemakers, Fashion Designers and Athletes who always seem to be left out of these Digital Revolutions. According to UNESCO's (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) latest Creative Economy Report ""the global market value of the creative economy is approximately US$1.6 trillion"".

Enjoy tremendous $avings with  an opportunity to get 2 major OS platforms (Windows and Android) in one convenient Digital Tablet.This is one of our great Innovation of Things working with our DIGILIB 3D Global Partners.TIMES SQ: The Digital Urban Grand Canyon of Global Creativity.This Digital Dollar Wave starts right here  in Times SQ, NYC, the Digital Urban Grand Canyon of Global Creativity, as the Ball Drops to usher in a brand New Digital Year! What an incredible event as millions of spectators, dwarfed by humongous hills of Digital Advertising Displays click on their mobile devices to capture Manhattan's Multimedia Magic  bursting into fireworks 25 stories above.  Broadcasters from all over the world capture the moment, especially our excited  DIGILIB 3D Broadcaster from  the Swedish Creative Economy. What's the Global Creative Economy? It's the economy emanating from the making, management, marketing and monetization of books, broadcasting, music, photography, TV programs, advertising, visual arts, culinary arts, live entertainment, theater, movies, magazines, greeting cards, newspapers, fashion, tourism, smart phone design, video game design, 3D Printing, apps, wearables and most ""things"" our creative minds can conceive or innovate... such as the Internet of Things. DIGILIB 3D is  the Digital 3D Interactive Library designed to help you and other members of the Global Creative Economy,  MAKE, MANAGE, MARKET and MONETIZE  Creativity or the Digital  Innovation of Things ! In a realistic  simulation of a real life library, DIGILIB 3D uses core Digital Interactive Components such as DIGIBOOKS, DIGIZINES, DIGICARDS, DIGIMUSIC, DIGITV, DIGIMAPS, DIGISPACE  and DIGIMOVIE. DIGIBOOK is the key component of DIGILIB 3D and can be used in all other ""DIGI"" products and services. More on DIGIBOOK later..This tsunami treasure chest of technology does NOT start off  in Silicon Valley, even though we strongly support the move by Facebook's Billionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg to declare 2015  the ""Year of  Books"" as his New Year's resolution. Our Global DIGILIB 3D Team are the best Innovators of Things and have been involved in the ""Decade of the DIGIBOOKS"", to digitally re-engineer and repurpose books, magazines, catalogs, greeting cards, encyclopedias  and newspapers to make them Socially Responsible, Environmentally Friendly, Economically Sustainable and Digitally Interactive (SEED). This Digital Dollar Wave  does not even begin at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2015) in Las Vegas  with its entertaining evangelism of the Internet of Things, even though we have already been a few years into our Innovation Of Things such as the Digital Transformation of Encyclopedias into DIGIPEDIAs.DIGITAL INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA TO MATCH THE MAGIC OF YOUR MIND !It is virtually impossible to contain the excitement of a live event in any form of conventional media, or your ability to create sensational products or services that simply wows people. . But with DIGILIB 3D Innovation of Things, we have been able to build the right cognitive model to allow you to dive into digitally innovative creations such as TIMES SQ DIGIPEDIA  and experience the exhilaration of many of these Times Square monthly events . A DIGIPEDIA is mainly a  collection of DIGIBOOKS.  WHAT IS  A DIGIBOOK Now let's explain what a DIGIBOOK really is in the following video. Take a look at the DIGIBOOK animation above before or after  you look at the video and you will see one of the best examples of the Digital Innovation of Things.Each DIGIBOOK is a simulation of a real book that can be manipulated in 3D space with all degrees of rotation and perspective based on the readers point of view. E-books do not operate in a true 3D space . There are no spines, front edge, top edge,etc like real books. Pages actually turn in all directions and orientations, with the cognitive sound caused by the friction of paper on paper so realistic that the reader treats it like a  real book. But that is where the comparison stops. DIGIBOOKS go way beyond real books and e-Books, combining words, photos, videos, apps, embedded streaming or live video pages (.e.g YouTube and Vimeo), maps. calendars, weather reports,  illustrations, multilingual narrations, closed caption, audio, music, movies, Hollywood style dramatic Foley and Sound Effects, Objects for 3D Printing, Movies, Medical Images such as MRI, Sonograms and X-rays, TV Programs, Games, animations, maps and Business Tables or Graphs, links to other DIGIBOOKS or even to other websites and webpages. It can easily interface with existing social media based on their published API such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google, etc.  See the Video of a DIGIBOOK from  the Times Sq DIGIPEDIA in full action later.   But wait, don't forget the earth we live on. As more and more creative people move into the world's urban areas, the environment becomes even more important. Consequently, when you become a Member of the Digital 3D Interactive Library Network (DIGILIB 3D) you are helping to protect the planet.For example we deliberately innovated Scratch off Cards like  the above Digital Scratch Off Library Membership Cards that do not use paper, foil or plastic; this is about saving trees and avoiding the use of fossil fuels used to make plastic and foil. At the same time the Digital Scratch Off Surface can be used to promote socially responsible causes, advertisements or charitable organizations. What an environmentally friendly way to advertise. As a DIGILIB 3D Member you are helping to fight Global Warming and the disastrous effects of Climate Change and at the same time promoting economic sustainability.. Mother Nature says ""Thank You"" for that ""Scratching Quarter"" representing the 25 cents DIGILIB 3D will contribute to the development of  Renewable Energy and Wireless Access (Batteries, Solar, Wind, Mini-Hydro, Human Energy, WIFI) to make DIGIBOOKS, DIGIZINE, DIGITV, DIGICARDS, DIGIMED (Medical Services), DEAN (Digital Education Advancement Network),DIGIPEDIA's and other Digital Interactive Products available to communities in developing countries. These are communities  with  limitations in conserving their virgin forests and severe problems powering classrooms and computer networks... and even mobile devices..You can even elevate your membership to be a DIGIBOOK PUBLISHER and  participate in the next and greatest generation of socio-economic development called Digital Interactive Social Publishing in the $400 Billion Global Publishing Industry. Using Digital Paper instead of printed paper, we can protect our environment even as we move quickly forward and integrate Social Responsibility, Environmental Friendliness, Economic Sustainability and Digital Innovation (SEED) at the core of Digital Product and Services...A S.E.E.D DIGIBOOK VOLUME OF TIMES SQ DIGIPEDIA IN FULL ACTION.Watch how the Same Opening Video can now be embedded in a Video Page of this DIGIBOOK Volume. It celebrates  the colorful creative climax of a  jam packed year in Times Square with over 300,000 daily pedestrians and 55 million annual visitors  who come from over 200 countries across the Globe. But we do not have to print 55 million copies of Magazines , Books or Brochures, avoiding the destruction of the rainforest just to create paper. Yes, this Digital Dollar Wave is all about YOU and how you can make, manage, market and monetize your Creativity or Innovation of Things in the Global Creative Economy.... but with sensitivities to the social, environmental and economic impact your participation can have. POSITIVE VIBRATIONS ALWAYS ! DIGITALLY TRANSFORMING THE PEOPLE POWERED GLOBAL CREATIVE ECONOMY This $1.6 Trillion Global Creative Economy (GCE) is the largest and most lucrative untapped people powered industry in the world, stretching across communities, cities, countries, continents and cultures. It is ready for DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION.... not DISRUPTION !This is mainly because other key global industries depend heavily on this Global Creative Economy  for their growth, our lifestyle and even our survival, such as: the priceless $5.5 Trillion Global Healthcare Industry, the $4.4 Trillion Global Education Industry,  $6 Trillion Global Travel & Tourism Industry,  the $5 Trillion Telecom Industry and the $1 Trillion Global Consumer Electronics Industry. Therefore if you work in or support any of the following creative industries , you can now MAKE, MANAGE, MARKET and MONETIZE YOUR CREATIVITY with DIGILIB 3D: Digital Media, Publishing, Advertising, Broadcast Media, Print Media, Social Media, Tourism, Education, Game Design, Sports, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Music, Film, Fashion, Photography, Industrial Design, Smart Phone  and Digital Tablet Design,  App Design,  Cultural Activities, Journalism, Toys, Culinary Arts, etcFortunately, you may already be a big part of  this lucrative global industry of innovators who, among other things,  help to produce, promote or profit from any creative combination of the following random examples: art for architecture, ads in apps, books with blogs, cakes and croissants, comics or cartoons,  dance for drama, drones over driveways, energy for education, jokes by  jugglers, jingles for jams, fabrics in fashion, hardware for homes, machines for manufacturing, maps with missions, music in movies, software as a service, sales graphs for sellers, photos by phones, theatre on TV, tourists in Times Square , videos going viral , watches on wrists or X-rays on Expressways.THE INTERNET OF THINGS versus THE INNOVATION OF THINGS The Internet of Things is Device-Driven. The Innovation of Things is People Powered. The Innovators of Things are the ones who create the Internet of Things and know how to apply those things creatively to complement and supplement other Global Industries, including their own Global Creative Industries. .The CES 2015 in Las Vegas was dominated by both large and small companies evangelizing the use of tiny embedded devices with IP addresses that can communicate with other devices over the Internet (e.g. Heart Rate Monitors and Sensors, GPS Drones, Smart Hotel Security Doors). This phenomenon is collectively referred to as the Internet of Things. In the  $1.6 Global Creative Economy,  incredible human minds can mix, match and merge  any combination of two or more elements of the above random examples to create new Innovations through the enhancement of current products and services provided by Creative Industries or invent millions of brand new ones. This is the transformation  we strategically refer as the Innovation of Things. Unfortunately, you may also be among the millions of creative geniuses who have no clue as to how to convert that burning creativity in you into a sustainable livelihood, successful social entrepreneurship or DIGITAL CASH ! But there is hope.DIGILIB 3D: THE NETWORK FOR THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE GLOBAL CREATIVE ECONOMY  To Make, Manage, Market & Monetize Your Creativity
The  Global Creative Economy (GCE) is a utility style economy like Energy, Power and Water  that empowers other multibillion dollar global industries to create jobs and business opportunities across the planet.

THE DIGITAL DOLLAR WAVE: DRIVEN BY THE DIGITAL INNOVATION OF THINGSThis time the  Digital Dollar Wave is driven by the Digital Innovation of Things  gushing out  from this amazing Digital Urban Grand Canyon of Global Creativity: TIMES SQ , NYC.  It's all in out TIMES SQ DIGIPEDIA... so PERK yourself Up !It will show you how to MONETIZE Your Creativity with DIGILIB 3D, the Digital 3D Interactive Library Network for the Innovation of Things.  It does not matter where in this Digital World you want to innovate. Its actually a big advantage to the Global Creative Economy that DIGILIB 3D Innovation of Things starts right here in Times Square, New York... a world within a city.. To paraphrase Frank Sinatra's famous ""New York, New York"" song, If you can digitally MAKE it here, you can digitally MAKE it anywhere. Now it's up to YOU to do it quickly and easily by following our many DIGILIB 3D examples of Digital Interactive  Visual Appliances (DIVA) designed to convert your CREATIVITY to CASH ... but with built-in Social Responsibility , Environmental Friendliness, Economic Sustainability and Digital Interactivity. So start ""spreading the news"".THE BEST EXAMPLES OF GLOBAL CREATIVITY IN THE WORLD The Digital Innovation of Things is based on the timely and tactical application or  customization of information models, examples or patterns to create better and brand new products and services as quickly as possible. From Ball Drop 2014 to Ball Drop 2015, the DIGILIB 3D Production Team took an entire year to capture some of the most exciting digital videos and panoramic photos of entertaining events in this Digital Creative Convergence Zone also known as Times Square, America's #1 Tourist Destination . Times Square is a world within a city with over 55 million visitors a year   and  300,000 pedestrians a day from over 200 countries across the globe. Cultural festivals from China, India, South Korea, Brazil and other parts of the Americas occur regularly to complement daily  National TV Network  morning show productions by VH1 and ABC. A parade  of non-profit promotional events such as Climate Change marches, fight against cancer, summer street fairs, Broadway shows , NASDAQ IPO ceremonies and a host of national sports press events.Now we can use this valuable content  from 1/1/2014 to 1/1/2015 to create living examples of a series of Digitally Innovative  Multimedia Products based on DIGILIB 3D. This includes Digital Interactive Magazines (DIGIZINES), Digital  Interactive Books (DIGIBOOKS),Digital Interactive Encyclopedias (DIGIPEDIA), Digital Interactive Greeting Cards (DIGICARDS) and Digital Interactive TV (e.g.TIMES SQ DIGIPEDIA, TIMES SQ TV and FASHION AVE TV).  BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN CREATIVITY AND TECHNOLOGYNow you can bridge that gap between creativity and technology by using these examples to create digital interactive products so impressive the world will think you spent years at MIT after your PhD at Harvard, followed by a few successful start ups in Silicon Valley  and invested a few million dollars to pull it off.Fortunately for the Global Creative Community, the DIGILIB 3D Global Teams have had decades of experience working professionally in  both the Global Creative Economy as well as in the Global Information Technology Industry and understand the tremendous creative output that can be generated with the meeting of those 2 mindsets. That's what DIGILIB 3D does so very well.. DIGITAL SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYIt is our Digital Social Responsibility  (DSR) to the Creative Community to digitally transform this $1.6 Trillion Global Creative Economy to make it  economically sustainable, environmentally friendly and socially responsible to  empower  new Digital Creative Entrepreneurs, Enterprises and Employees. This is the biggest untapped people powered industry in the world. We want it to be DIGITALLY TRANSFORMED.... NOT DISRUPTED. Too many people at the Bottom of the economic Pyramid (BOP) depend on these creative industries for their livelihood and it would be irresponsible to disrupt their income before elevating them to another level of economic sustainability. We all know what happened to both the Top of the Pyramid Executives of the Recording Music Industry as well those small BOP vendors who  provided so many community sales outlet for both established and unestablished music artists.THE DIGITAL LIBRARY INFORMATION MODEL (LIMO) DIGILIB 3D is based on simple , yet powerful, information management model you and billions of other  people around the world trust and have been using from childhood. Its already embedded in your intellect and memory whether you are ""left brain"" logical or right brain ""creative"". Luckily, this model will stay in your head forever and is actually used as an organizational pattern for  past, present and future knowledge acquisition through lifestyle, academic  and business experiences. We call this the Library Information Model  or the LIMO.  It's the one digital vehicle in which both the creative and non-creative people can ride with  the appreciation, if not understanding, of each other's role, responsibilities, risks and rewards. So why not use what you already have to get what you really want?LIMO: RIDING ON A MODEL OF SUCCESSJust think of the power of this simple LIMO model to change the world. It is the same Library Information Model that creative geniuses like Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs depended on for research and knowledge acquisition before the Internet,  Search Engines , Online Databases, Desktops,  Laptops, Tablets or  Smart Phones to feed their hungry pioneering spirits. Not even a ""CLOUD"" in the Cyber Sky to obscure their nascent digital creativity that will one day change the world. With the type of  design, technical and business information they and their support teams found in public, private, academic and business libraries, they were able to make , manage, market and monetize the early Apple II and the Microsoft Disk Operating System for the IBM PC. So it was this same LIMO or Library Information Model that triggered a technology ripple in the  early 1980's  that has since mushroomed  into wave after wave of innovative consumer digital products and services such as MS Windows, XBOX, Microsoft Surface, Apple MacBook, iPhone, Ipad,iPhones, IOS, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon Kindle, Android, Samsung Galaxy  and many more over the years. LIMO: A FAST COMFORTABLE RIDE BACK TO THE DIGITAL URBAN  FUTURE.That was then. Now it's Back to the Future. Today over 80% of Americans now live in urban areas in cities such as New York City.  So too are urban areas in many countries around the world such as Japan, UK, Brazil and Canada (See report on Global Urbanization by the World Bank later). The oasis of knowledge, facts and information in these urban areas is still the Library: public, private, academic, research, law, business. Same Library Information Model you already understand. DIGILIB 3D: FOR A DYNAMIC NEW DIGITAL URBAN WORLD It is important to note that this latest Creative Digital Dollar Wave is also very URBAN. According to the World Bank over 75% of the respective populations of the USA (81%), UK (82%), Canada (81%), Japan (92%), South Korea (82%), Brazil (85%), Argentina (91%) , Belgium (98%) , Netherlands (89%) , Australia (89%), Mexico (79%), Germany (76%), France (79%) and Spain (79%)  are now living in urban areas (mainly cities, towns and the districts around them). The rest of the world , including China, is now over 53% urban and expanding rapidly  (Source: World Bank).  FROM THE LIMO TO DIGILIB 3D: A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF AN INFORMATION MODEL YOU ALREADY UNDERSTAND AND TRUSTDIGILIB 3D is a realistic digital transformation of that trusted Library Information Model or LIMO. Yes, a Digital Immersive Simulation of the same Library you have been using since High School. DIGILIB 3D  is therefore the best Library Information Model  to handle the constant intellectual inflow and outflow of the Digital Global Creative Economy with multiple levels of local, regional and national customization. Great for Nation Branding  of the Creative Industries for both developed and developing countries.The following diagram shows how DIGILIB 3D can transform the lucrative global industries that depend on contributors from the Global Creative Economy into a formidable Revenue Oriented Digital Interactive Library Network for Everything... by Everyone Anywhere ... at Anytime using a well defined array of innovative Digital Interactive Visual Appliances (DIVA) and applications to MAKE, MANAGE, MARKET and MONETIZE creativity.

Every group brings such a rich multicultural flavor to our creative science pool that we know we can  help morph your creative mind into blockbuster digital products based on our Digital M4 Methodology (MAKE,MANAGE, MARKET, MONETIZE) of rapid development through monetization.We are Creative Scientists  and having spent years bridging the digital gap between technology and  the best in the creative world, from photographers to videographers, journalist to editors, writers to publishers,  musicians to songwriters,  filmmakers to scriptwriters,, TV producers to Advertising Directors, the Digital M4 Methodology is by far the best way to convert your CREATIVITY into CASH. This is because we can provide you with DIGISMART SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) instead of techie's or programmers to  get your project running. This is based on the UN MDG Goal #8, Global Partnerships. THE BEST EX-TEAM TO DIGITALLY TRANSFORM THE GLOBAL CREATIVE ECONOMY BASED ON UN MDG GOALSTo make DIGILIB 3D the most socially responsible, environmentally friendly, culturally diverse and economically sustainable Digital 3D Interactive Multimedia platform in the world, we continue to  put together the best, brightest, bravest, boldest and most beautiful EX-Team on the planet. This includes our EX-CELLENT CORE CREATIVE DIGILIB 3D GLOBAL TEAM and some EX-ceptionally talented EX-corporate friends, family, fans and financial gurus (ex-IBM, ex-Bell Labs, ex-AT&T, ex-Nielsen, ex-Silicon Valley, ex-Hollywood, ex-Broadcast, ex-Wall Street, ex-Fashion Ave , ex-Madison Ave, ex-cetera) who share our beliefs that we can make the world a better place by empowering creative ""right brain"" geniuses like you with the latest Digital 3D Interactive Multimedia Technology.  DIGISMART SME Programs are designed to create new Digital Entrepreneurs and Employees all over the world, especially in urban innercity communities where unbridled creativity abounds... but with no revenue oriented methodology to manage, market and monetize it to the benefit of the creative content owner or custodian. YOUR DIGISMART ADVANTAGE

DIGITAL Scholars Motivated to Achieve using Raw Talent(DIGISMART)

DIGITAL Subject Matter  Application Related Technologist(DIGISMART)


Having spent some of our formative years as technologists or consultants at Multinational IT companies such as IBM, BELL LABS, AT&T, REUTERS, NIELSEN, ADOBE and in Wall Street firms, many of us on the DIGILIB 3D Team know very well how the  high costs or lack of enough affordable experienced technical developers and support has stifled the development of more innovative products and services for global industries which have depended on input and advice from Global  Creative Economy for decades.

DIGILIB 3D 's social empowerment objective is to develop a new generation of ""right-brain"" Digitally SMART (DIGISMART) Entrepreneurs, Employees and Employers from the Global Creative Economy based on their raw talent and experience in related subject matters.. Avoid critical dependence  for expensive computer programmers, techies and geeks who are more Left Brain Logic than Right Brain Random and seldom speak your cool creative language.. 
Need help on developing your project?. Call in a DIGISMART SME or team digitally or physically. They are Subject Matter Experts and will know what you are doing or want to do because that is what they have done or are doing. No technical talk, unless you insist. We even provide a DIGISMART PERK to get you started on your own DIGIBOOK or DIGIZINE project.
This is the first digital ecosystem that comes with Digital Subject Matter Experts in addition to Social Media Experts,  animators, cartoonists, video editors, voice over pecialists, music engineers, writers, advertising experts, marketing and sales experts. So PERK yourself up with a DIGISMART SME Training Workshop right here in fabulous Times Square... or digitally from where you are.. If you want to help to change the world for the better and provide jobs to urban innercity communities, you can kindly PERK up some talented creative genius in the USA, across the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia. This helps to support UN MDG Goal #1 and at the same time bring the power of the Global Creative Economy  to less fortunate communities that can rise up and support each other and their entire state or country. But most importantly, in 2015 and beyond we can all help to execute UN Millennium Development Goals (UN MDG) of Poverty Eradication, Universal Education, Gender Equality, Reduction of Child Mortality, Promotion of Maternal Health,  Prevention of Infectious Diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Ebola, plus the common cold that has morphed into uncommon killer flus even in some parts of the USA), Environmental Sustainability and Global Partnerships.  CREATE SOPHISTICATED DIGITAL PRODUCTS WITH  SIMPLE EX-AMPLESOur DIGILIB 3D EX-Team Members are living up to their core beliefs in the Power of the UN MDG Global Partnerships in Creativity based on the  mantra of the great creative guru Leonardo Da Vinci: ""Simplicity is the ultimate EX-ample of Sophistication"".  DIGILIB 3D is a simple Digital Interactive Simulation or example of a real Library, which in itself is a sophisticated organization of information that is simple to understand because of examples of books, magazines, newspapers, maps, research papers, DVDs, CDs, audio tapes on shelves, book cases, etc..AMAZING INTERACTIVE VIEWING EXPERIENCE OF DIGILIB 3D 
Here comes an increasingly important Innovation of Things that can be used by many industries In our many years of field testing DIGILIB 3D across the globe, one simple Digital Interactive Visual Appliance (DIVA) got WOWs after WOWs from the Creative Community: the DIGILENS, a working simulation  of the conventional magnifying glass used in libraries to read fine print, magnify maps, diagrams or photos. Well we took the creative technology even further  to the final frontier :VIDEO DIGILENS.  

It is amazing what application of real life information consumption tools such as DIGILENS can do to the elevation of interest in any content. To dynamically place magnifying lens over live or recorded video while in motion is a virtually impossible scientific task that not too many video programming tech gurus have figured out, far less build and implement. You don't see it in YouTube, nor Vimeo, Netflix, Hulu, HBO GO,Microsoft Media Player or Google. Not even in Apple Macbook, Ipad or iPhone.

 Think of how many business, scientific, medical, entertainment  and  scholastic applications one can build with DIGILENS, DIGIBOOKS, DIGIGAME and  DIGITV working together with DIGILIB 3D. This is the Global Creative Economy morphing into Digital Creative Science.THE TIMES SQUARE DIGIPEDIA From Ball Drop to Ball Drop, the TIMES SQUARE DIGIPEDIA will be a living history  of the WHO'S WHO, WHERE'S WHERE, WHAT'S WHAT, WHEN'S WHEN  with the HOW and WHY these exciting activities occur in this #1 TOURIST DESTINATION and in the #1 TV MARKET in the USA.... surrounded by ABC, MTV, BET, VH1, NICKELODEON and a host of other Entertainment and Media Studios. PERK YOURSELF UP WITH THE LARGEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE DIGITAL ADVERTISING DISPLAY IN THE WORLDIn November 2014, the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square and some of ""the Multimedia Mavens of Madison Avenue""  installed the largest and most expensive Digital Advertising Display in the world. (24 million pixels covering 8 stories high and 1.25 City Blocks wide on Broadway, rented by Google at around $625,000 weekly). Now this has become one of the biggest Tourist attractions to the 300,000 pedestrians coming through the park daily as Google Maps showed off incredible wide angle vistas of Harlem, Brooklyn, Manhattan  and humongous images of the New York Harbor with the Statue of Liberty in all its glory..BUILDING REVENUE ORIENTED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH DIGILIB 3D With DIGILIB 3D, you dont have to subscribe to the entire DIGIPEDIA, just the volumes you are interested it.

When you are done, just check them back in. Simple. Just like a college library or a public library.PERK YOURSELF UP WITH A DIGILIB LIBRARY CARD:BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM,, BLACK.DIGILIB 3D - A SUPER NETWORK OF DIGITAL INTERACTIVE NETWORKSIts like combining a Multilingual, Multicultural Core with  a Digital Book-Magazine-Newspaper Publishing Network,  a Digital TV Network , a Digital Music Network, a Digital Movie Network, a Digital Community Cinema Network and  a Digital Education Administration Network (DEAN) built on a Digital Commercial, Advertising and Sales Hub(DIGICASH) that makes a true revenue generating ecosystem.  TIMES SQUARE - THE PERFECT DIGITAL STORM FOR DIGILIB 3DTimes Square is the PERFECT DIGITAL STORM that triggers this rapidly growing new DIGITAL DOLLAR WAVE . This is the boiling cauldron of the Creative Convergence Zone that empowers the new Digital Urban World.  This wave will rush down Manhattan's Silicon Alley from Broadway to Fashion Ave straight to wherever you operate in the Global Creative Economy, especially in countries like the USA, UK, Brazil, Japan, Spain, France and Canada where over 75% of the population has moved to urban areas..  The DIGILIB 3D Team also uses this TIMES SQUARE DIGIPEDIA as a hands on training tool in our DIGITAL INTERACTIVE MEDIA EDUCATION (DIME) for those smart and lucky enough to come to our exciting training workshops in Times Square (See the PERKS). You learn quickly and easily by having fun while immersing yourself into Times Square's organized chaos of digital creativity, producing real DIGIBOOKS and DIGIZINES and understanding by example how Digital Interactive TV programs are produced for Times Square Digital TV Network that will also be based on DIGILIB 3D. Meet some great creative people from around the world who also come here for the WOW in learning by doing.Remember you will be operating in the same Times Square plaza where MTV, VH1, NICKELODEON, ABC and many other Entertainment and Media companies from the USA and around the world produce their daily, weekly or monthly programs. In fact, you will be able to see how shows like ABC's Good Morning America is produced if you can wake up early enough after some exciting nights going to Broadway shows or indulging in Times Square Night life. NASDAQ -A WEALTHY NEIGHBOR OUTSIDE THE DIGILIB 3D STUDIO WINDOWThe Digital Dollar Wave flows right through the NASDAQ Stock Exchange with its towering Digital Advertising Display hovering over a multicultural melting pot of 55 million annual tourists and 300,000 pedestrians per day from all over the world.But, most importantly to the Global Creative Economy, the NASDAQ is where some of the top revenue generating companies in the $4 Trillion Global Information Technology Industry, such as APPLE, AMAZON, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, INTEL, ADOBE, EBAY,CISCO and YAHOO, converge with some of the most successful corporations in the $4 Trillion Global Entertainment and Media Industry,  such as COMCAST, DISH, NETFLIX, FOX, GOPRO, VIACOM (MTV, VH1, BET, COMEDY CENTRAL, etc.), to raise trillions of dollars in public capital to convert their creativity to cash. Many of these technology companies started with a vision which was then nurtured in Silicon Valley, but it is the financial power of the NASDAQ in Times Square, the wave maker at the top of  Silicon Alley,  that fuels their fortune. As a PERK for the curious Investment Creativity in you we have included the above Investment and Banking DIGIBOOK as one of the volumes of the TIMES SQ DIGIPEDIA. The Investment and Banking DIGIBOOK shows many of the new NASDAQ listed companies, their executives and main investors as they stand in awe of themselves  in Times Square plaza looking up at their photos and video clips, or company TV commercials on the giant NASDAQ screen on the day of the IPO. PERK YOURSELF UP WITH THE DIGISMART WAY OF CONVERTING YOUR CREATIVITY TO CASHWant to be a champion of the new DIGITAL INTERACTIVE SOCIAL PUBLISHING DOLLAR WAVE?. With DIGILIB 3D, your creative juices can create content that can be expressed in many different revenue generating ways. A DIGILIB 3D Network can contain DIGIBOOKS, DIGIZINES, DIGICARDS, DIGIMUSIC , DIGITV, DIGIMOVIES and a wide array of other Digitally Interactive Products and Services that can be mixed, matched, merged, marketed and monetized. The following DIGIBOOK example contains elements of a DIGIZINE, DIGIMUSIC, DIGICASH DIGITAN (Tourism Advancement Network), DIGICARDS (DANCING) and DIGITV. The Dancing DIGIBOOK is to capture the attention of the Reader as it moves to the groove of the DIGIMUSIC Video. Great for Children Books, Tourism Guides and Cultural Brochures.We currently have over 25 DIGI products and services based on DIGILIB 3D, all of which can communicate with each other. DIGILIB 3Dgoes beyond  Platform, Cloud, Network or Operating System. It is a Digital 3D Ecosystem , a Network of Networks, with a Synaptic Online Universal Language that can generate an infinite number of Digital Interactive Visual Applications (DIVA). E-BOOKS NOT E-NOUGHFrom Industry Research Reports, the E-Book Market is now about $15 Billion and Growing at 17% CAGR  and will try to dominate Global Book Publishing Industry With 27.8% Share by 2019 . However, when compared to the $400 Billion  Global Publishing Industry and the $4 Trillion Entertainment and Media Industry , plus the ubiquitous $4.4 Trillion Global Education Market, the E-Book Market of $15 Billon is miniscule. DIGIBOOKS goes way beyond E-BOOKS because it is part of an integrated Digital Interactive Library Ecosystem consistung of Digital TV, Digital Interactive Music, Movies, Magazines and Digital Interactive Games that can all talk to each other.. All   that content can be dynamically repurpose as TV programs in  a Digital Book or Games in a Page of a Book, without having to re-author the book. In this way DIGIBOOKS can be used at live program Guides for TV Channels or networks. E-Books cannot do that. Yet DIGIBOOKS can read the same EPUB XML files that makes an E-BOOK an EBOOK.  FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WITH DIGITAL INTERACTIVE SOCIAL PUBLISHINGDigital Interactive Social Publishing is a brand new area of publishing. Because you are not bounded by physical media with the inherent limitations that precludes the proliferation of your literary works, a DIGIBOOK, DIGIZINE, DIGIPEDIA, DIGICARD, DIGIMUSIC or DIGIMOVIE publication can be distributed across communities, cities, countries, continent and cultures in various languages and localized styles.

<p>Even if you ""know"" this scale and all the others, this will give you an entirely different perspective on the whole fretboard as well as music theory in general. It will change  how you view and play your instrument. You will become more proficient and connected with the flow.

<p>-<b>You can apply this theory to Guitar, Bass, Mandolin, Ukulele, Banjo, Violin, Cello, and all stringed instruments while wearing a blindfold</b>. You will also be able to apply it to Piano, and all other instruments because of the complete understanding of music theory you will obtain. </p>

<p>- Learn how to connect with a zen like flow and play effortlessly across the entire fretboard </p>
<p>-Much like typing or using a video game controller, you’ll be able to control your every note without looking or thinking. This is what is called “Hand- Ear” coordination and it is one of the many things you will take from this method. </p>

And do not hesitate to share this page, the more we'll be seen, the more chances we have to reach our goal ;)</blockquote>
<div>
<br/><h2>Le Paganisme en France</h2>
<p>Bien que plusieurs traditions païennes soient reconnues à travers l'Europe, la France reste encore frileuse sur ce point.</p>
<p>Pourtant la communauté païenne française est bien présente. En faisant un rapide tour des réseaux sociaux (faute d'outil de statistique plus élaboré), on peut estimer le nombre de pratiquant(e)s païen(ne)s à environ 10 000 personnes. Les traditions les plus représentées étant le Druidisme, l'Asatrù, l'Hellénisme, et la Wicca.</p>
<div>Cependant, être païen(ne) en France, n'est pas chose facile ; ces traditions étant la plupart du temps, méconnues et dépréciées par le grand public, les pratiquant(e)s de ces diverses traditions sont souvent isolé(e)s.</div>
<div>C'est de ce constat qu'est née l'idée du Pagan Café : offrir un lieu de rencontre, d'échange et de découverte tant pour les païen(ne)s que pour les non-païen(ne)s, dans le respect et l'acceptation de l'autre.</div>
<div>
<h2>Le Pagan Café, qu'est ce que c'est ?</h2>
<p>Le Pagan Café sera un lieu de rencontre pour tous les païen(ne)s de toutes traditions ; un lieu pour partager, échanger, discuter, en toute amitié, autour d'une pinte, d'un muffin ou d'une tisane.</p>
<p>Un espace à la fois convivial et chaleureux, qui offre une véritable opportunité pour rencontrer d'autres païen(ne)s et sympathisant(e)s dans une ambiance confortable et relaxante.</p>

</div></div>","L'idée : un café associatif, dédié au paganisme et à ses adeptes, offrant un lieu de rencontre, de partage et d'échanges autour du paganisme, de l'ésotérisme et de la spiritualité.
Welcome to all english speaking visitors ! To see the english version of this project, please click here, you'll find a pdf document with the translation of the folowing presentation. And do not hesitate to share this page, the more we'll be seen, the more chances we have to reach our goal ;)

Le Paganisme en France
Bien que plusieurs traditions païennes soient reconnues à travers l'Europe, la France reste encore frileuse sur ce point.
Pourtant la communauté païenne française est bien présente. En faisant un rapide tour des réseaux sociaux (faute d'outil de statistique plus élaboré), on peut estimer le nombre de pratiquant(e)s païen(ne)s à environ 10 000 personnes. Les traditions les plus représentées étant le Druidisme, l'Asatrù, l'Hellénisme, et la Wicca.
Cependant, être païen(ne) en France, n'est pas chose facile ; ces traditions étant la plupart du temps, méconnues et dépréciées par le grand public, les pratiquant(e)s de ces diverses traditions sont souvent isolé(e)s.
C'est de ce constat qu'est née l'idée du Pagan Café : offrir un lieu de rencontre, d'échange et de découverte tant pour les païen(ne)s que pour les non-païen(ne)s, dans le respect et l'acceptation de l'autre.

Le Pagan Café, qu'est ce que c'est ?
Le Pagan Café sera un lieu de rencontre pour tous les païen(ne)s de toutes traditions ; un lieu pour partager, échanger, discuter, en toute amitié, autour d'une pinte, d'un muffin ou d'une tisane.
Un espace à la fois convivial et chaleureux, qui offre une véritable opportunité pour rencontrer d'autres païen(ne)s et sympathisant(e)s dans une ambiance confortable et relaxante.
Le projet est d’ouvrir le Pagan Café dans le centre de Paris, au quatrième trimestre 2015. Le lieu que nous voulons créer sera beau, il sera contemporain et chaleureux et totalement inédit.
Si le Pagan Café sera, comme son nom l'indique, un lieu de restauration, ce sera en fait, bien plus que ça.
Espace polyvalent, douillet, convivial, mélange entre salon de thé pour vos brunchs, déjeuners et goûters - à base de produits bios et gourmands -  ; bibliothèque avec une sélection d'ouvrages sur l'ésotérisme, l'occultisme, la spiritualité, l'histoire... à bouquiner sur place, au fond d'un canapé moelleux ; boutique, où trouver tous les outils nécessaires à votre pratique - encens, bougies, pierres, plantes... - ; et le soir venu, bar, dans lequel vous pourrez siroter une bière bio ou un vin de fleurs, et vous détendre dans une ambiance chaleureuse.
Le Pagan Café accueillera régulièrement des événements autour du Paganisme, de l'ésotérisme et de la spiritualité : 
- Dîner-débats
- Soirées à thèmes (lors des célébrations païennes par exemple)
- Expositions
- Conférences
...
Bien loin d'être réservé aux païen(ne)s et sympathisants, cet espace un peu hors du temps, sera ouvert à tous et saura, charmer tout le monde :)

Café associatif

La structure existera tout d'abord sous forme d'association, dont les contributeurs à cette campagne, le personnel et bien sûr les fondateurs, feront partie. Si le projet fonctionne, que l'activité devient rentable, la structure se transformera en SCOPARL, un statut coopératif pour une entreprise durable.
Les éventuels bénéfices provenant des activités du Pagan Café seront distribués de la manière suivante :

- 35% pour le développement des activités du Pagan Café
- 65% seront reversés à d'autres associations que nous soutenons et qui rentrent dans les thématiques suivantes : reconnaissance et soutien aux mouvements païens, écologie et environnement, commerce équitable, aide aux personnes en difficulté physique, psychologique ou sociale.
Le but n'est pas l'enrichissement ou entrepreneuriat, mais la création et la pérennité d'un espace d'échange, de partage et de rencontre.

<blockquote><p>“These children need us to solve this well before 2086, they need us to solve this while they are still children, ... <b>and we can!</b>”</p></blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span>Our Solution</span></h1>
<p>We are designing a solution that will enable children to develop skills, learn about the world, and foster their creativity and passions by teaching each other. <b>Technology will be their tool, not their teacher.</b> Curiosity will fuel their discovery of curriculum. And sharing, not software, will be what drives their <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/2015/10/25/self-organised-learning-environments-sole-and-mobile-devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">success</a>. </p>Our highly scalable platform operates both online and offline, on low-cost tablets and can be deployed into challenging remote environments to reach the most chronically under-served children. Together with our <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/ourapproach/#radically-open"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">open philosophy</a>, which allows us to attract the brightest minds, we know we can solve this while these children are still young! <br/><br/><h3><span>What we are doing now: Phase Two</span></h3>
<p><span><span>In Phase two — which this campaign is funding — we’re putting all the pieces together for the core technology infrastructure, continuing to field test in the East African country of Tanzania, and crowdsource culturally appropriate content.</span></span></p>
<p><b>The Platform:<br/></b>We are developing a platform that provides children a curated curriculum for early learning: reading, writing and arithmetic. With an open, flexible architecture that is language and curriculum agnostic, our platform will deliver unique and <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/2015/9/14/global-collaboration-day-join-our-workshops"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crowdsourced content</a> from local educators and publishers.<br/></p>The platform will deliver key and unique features designed to foster the children's creativity and passion and empower self-directed and peer-to-peer learning. It will include the analytics process that will drive each child’s recommendation engine, build the foundations of their open learning map, and the initial explorative game interface that inspires these children to learn. Our full roadmap can be found<a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/2015/8/19/impact-roadmap"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> here</a>.<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Field tests and pilots: </b><br/><span>Our goal for 2016 is to work with a few thousand children, many of them through our pilot program in Tanzania. Dev4X’s Head of Pedagogy, Natalie Denmeade is in charge of that pilot, and her progress can be followed through a series we are posting on our blog and social pages: <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/?category=Tanzania+Phase+two+field"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this link</a></span><a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/?category=Tanzania+Phase+two+field"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>. </p>

These are children who want to improve their lives and their futures, and need your help to have that opportunity.</div>

<h3><b>The Success of Phase One</b></h3>
<p></p>
<span>In Phase One, we researched <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/2015/10/25/self-organised-learning-environments-sole-and-mobile-devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">best approaches</a> and combined off-the-shelf content with a custom launcher app that tracked the progress of students. With this prototype, we tested how children, given no instructions or guidance, would learn to navigate the device and use the software. All of these children overcame the initial technology literacy hurdle and began learning. This culminated in a successful <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/2015/6/19/field-testing-in-east-africa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">field test</a> earlier this year in east Africa where we learned a great deal about the best ways to deliver our approach, culturally relevant content and self directed user interface requirements.

<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p></p>
<p><span><span>Imagine a world where every child has a personally adapted learning platform that can empower them to take control of their learning. A platform that will foster their creativity, ignite their passion, and instill empathy and compassion as they learn with their friends, their community and the world around them. <br/></span></span></p>
<p>What would happen if the <b>250 million illiterate children </b>in the world, learned to read, write? What about if the <b>millions of children who will never go to school</b> could still learn anything they needed to? What would result if more than 74% of those that started school, graduated instead of dropping out? What about if 60% of the global illiterate weren’t women who make <b>family decisions</b> on spending, nutrition and health, or if the world’s poorest girls were on track to achieve universal primary completion <b>before 2086?</b> What if we could increase average educational attainment of a country’s population by one year to increase annual GDP per capital growth from <b>2 to 2.5%?</b> What would result if the world’s youth who live in conflict areas could still learn, foster their creativity, ignite their passion, and instill empathy and compassion then become their nations’ <b>leaders of tomorrow?</b><br/></p>

<p><b>Measuring Success:</b><br/>Defining where we are going and how we will be measuring success is important. One of the ways we are doing so is by developing towards and measuring against specific impacts we want to attain. We have created this impact roadmap infographic to illustrate this. For more detail, you can read further<a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/2015/8/19/impact-roadmap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> here</a>.<br/></p>

</h1>
<p><b>Scaling the impact:</b><br/>This impact does not mean much if it is not easily reproducible and scalable, which is why from the ground up this has been one of the top design guidelines we have implemented. The solution we are developing is designed to be highly scalable and viral in it's growth capacity. Culturally relevant content can be rapidly produced, remixed and translated, allowing it to be deployed into regions current approaches cannot reach.</p>

<p><b>The learning map:</b><br/>In this phase of the project the core implementation of a highly scalable and flexible learning map is being developed. Unlike other similar initiatives we are developing this to be open and available to all, with the goal of providing curriculum and educational specialists a powerful tool test and validate their approaches.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445367373/v2ykxnkzn1zoxa0lon6i.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 616.543px; height: 348px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The learning world interface: </b><br/>In this phase we will also begin building the game layer interface that will engage children and inspire them to explore. An interesting and exciting learning world game layer is a key component that will keep children engaged, learning and continually wanting to come back for more.  </p>

<br/><h1>Questions and Answers<br/>
</h1>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Are you a non-profit? Can I write-off my contribution with my taxes?</b> <br/>Yes, Dev4X INCORPORATED is a registered 501(c)(3) charity (EIN 47-2367984). You will receive tax receipts for your donations through the crowdfunding campaign.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Why are you crowdfunding?</b><br/>We believe the quickest way to tackle this grand challenge is with open collaboration. This crowdfunding campaign is a great way by which we can rally the support of many people from around the world. <span>It is also a way of showcasing our efforts to larger organizations intending to fund this project that there is strong global backing for a radically new and open approach to tackling this challenge.</span> </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What if you raise more money than what is requested here?</b><br/>This campaign is to raise funds for phase two, additional funds will assist us to move into further phases of the project, and accelerate the impact we can achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>How will the money be used, and how can I track the progress?</b><br/>As an open project, we are transparent with our efforts. You can follow our continued progress via our <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website blog</a>, on social media and see the real world impact your donation is making. The funds raised in this campaign will go to developing phase two of the platform and working in East Africa. Over the next year, our aim is to deploy to a few thousand children, many of whom will be reached through our pilot in Tanzania being run by our head of pedagogy, Natalie Denmeade. Her progress can be followed through a series we are posting on our blog and social pages which can be followed through <a href=""http://www.dev4x.com/blog/?category=Tanzania+Phase+two+field"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this link</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why not raise funds from NGO's and Governments?</b><br/>We are raising funds from multiple sources, including NGO's and Governments, however, we are purposefully being very cautious because many of these sources are filled with bureaucracy, inefficiency, politics and in many cases corruption. We are staying true to our mission and concentrating on what's most important, the children. This is also why crowdfunding is such a powerful option. In the short term this strategy makes things more difficult but in the long term it's what's going to allow us to succeed where so many others get stuck in politics, protectionism, short term thinking and pandering to the status quo.</p>
<p><b>How are you different to other initiatives? </b><br/>Some of the key innovations that are setting us apart are: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our radically open approach. Developing an open platform with a sustainable long term strategy in place allows us to both rapidly engage the world's expertise but also sustain it with a self-funding business model. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are building our platform to work both online and offline. Therefore, participation in online collaboration would be offered in both synchronous and asynchronous modes. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our underlying platform foundation is built on highly scalable architecture and utilizes a dynamic open learning map that allows it to be rapidly extended to any curriculum, language or outcome, and adapted to each child. While there are a few such learning maps, most are based on closed-ended, siloed business models that do not allow them to be interoperable or they are focused on specific domains. We are creating an open version that many can contribute to and anyone can use.

</div></div>","Revolutionizing education: self-directed, peer-to-peer learning for 1 billion under-served children around the worldMaybe it’s chronic poverty, maybe it’s hazardous geography. Perhaps conflicts, humanitarian disasters, or gender-stratified societies interfering. Whatever the cause, there are over 50 million children that cannot go to school and hundreds of millions more that cannot get even a basic primary education. Even with all the sustained work of Governments, NGO's and individuals working to resolve this global challenge, UNESCO reports this problem will not be fully addressed until 2086. That means an additional three generations of children may be left behind!
That’s where your donation comes in. With a pledge of just $25, you can help one of these under-served children – many of them young girls – be empowered to take their learning into their own hands.





“These children need us to solve this well before 2086, they need us to solve this while they are still children, ... and we can!”

Our Solution
We are designing a solution that will enable children to develop skills, learn about the world, and foster their creativity and passions by teaching each other. Technology will be their tool, not their teacher. Curiosity will fuel their discovery of curriculum. And sharing, not software, will be what drives their success. Our highly scalable platform operates both online and offline, on low-cost tablets and can be deployed into challenging remote environments to reach the most chronically under-served children. Together with our open philosophy, which allows us to attract the brightest minds, we know we can solve this while these children are still young! What we are doing now: Phase Two
In Phase two — which this campaign is funding — we’re putting all the pieces together for the core technology infrastructure, continuing to field test in the East African country of Tanzania, and crowdsource culturally appropriate content.
The Platform:We are developing a platform that provides children a curated curriculum for early learning: reading, writing and arithmetic. With an open, flexible architecture that is language and curriculum agnostic, our platform will deliver unique and crowdsourced content from local educators and publishers.The platform will deliver key and unique features designed to foster the children's creativity and passion and empower self-directed and peer-to-peer learning. It will include the analytics process that will drive each child’s recommendation engine, build the foundations of their open learning map, and the initial explorative game interface that inspires these children to learn. Our full roadmap can be found here.
Field tests and pilots: Our goal for 2016 is to work with a few thousand children, many of them through our pilot program in Tanzania. Dev4X’s Head of Pedagogy, Natalie Denmeade is in charge of that pilot, and her progress can be followed through a series we are posting on our blog and social pages: this link. 


 
 
 
Phase two funding and features:For phase two of our project we are looking to raise over $25000 from interested global citizens like yourself, and following a successful crowdfunding campaign, have that matched by various philanthropists and foundations. These funds allow us to develop and deploy an innovative and impactful educational platform to some of the most underserved children in Tanzania and elsewhere. These are children who want to improve their lives and their futures, and need your help to have that opportunity.







"" This crowd-funded approach will send a powerful message that there are people all over the world willing to support a radically different approach to solving this grand challenge! ""  - Bodo Hoenen 


The Success of Phase One

In Phase One, we researched best approaches and combined off-the-shelf content with a custom launcher app that tracked the progress of students. With this prototype, we tested how children, given no instructions or guidance, would learn to navigate the device and use the software. All of these children overcame the initial technology literacy hurdle and began learning. This culminated in a successful field test earlier this year in east Africa where we learned a great deal about the best ways to deliver our approach, culturally relevant content and self directed user interface requirements. See more information here.


About Us
We believe we can reach the millions of children who otherwise would not be reached until 2086, within the next 10 years. We can do this through our audacious approach and by embracing the power of community-based open collaboration. 
The Dev4x team is a growing group of over 200 amazing volunteers, advisors and supporters, several PhD’s, neuroscientists, numerous educators, technologists, and designers, with more joining each week. We all believe that the right to have an education should not be limited by poverty, location, or social class and are tierlessly working to make that happen.
See our about us page and an interactive map of our team here.

The Impact

Imagine a world where every child has a personally adapted learning platform that can empower them to take control of their learning. A platform that will foster their creativity, ignite their passion, and instill empathy and compassion as they learn with their friends, their community and the world around them. 
What would happen if the 250 million illiterate children in the world, learned to read, write? What about if the millions of children who will never go to school could still learn anything they needed to? What would result if more than 74% of those that started school, graduated instead of dropping out? What about if 60% of the global illiterate weren’t women who make family decisions on spending, nutrition and health, or if the world’s poorest girls were on track to achieve universal primary completion before 2086? What if we could increase average educational attainment of a country’s population by one year to increase annual GDP per capital growth from 2 to 2.5%? What would result if the world’s youth who live in conflict areas could still learn, foster their creativity, ignite their passion, and instill empathy and compassion then become their nations’ leaders of tomorrow?


Measuring Success:Defining where we are going and how we will be measuring success is important. One of the ways we are doing so is by developing towards and measuring against specific impacts we want to attain. We have created this impact roadmap infographic to illustrate this. For more detail, you can read further here.



Scaling the impact:This impact does not mean much if it is not easily reproducible and scalable, which is why from the ground up this has been one of the top design guidelines we have implemented. The solution we are developing is designed to be highly scalable and viral in it's growth capacity. Culturally relevant content can be rapidly produced, remixed and translated, allowing it to be deployed into regions current approaches cannot reach.




The Technology we are buildingWe have a detailed page dedicated to explaining where we are going in addition to a conceptual prototype, which can be viewed here.  below are the highlights.

The overview:

 
The learning map:In this phase of the project the core implementation of a highly scalable and flexible learning map is being developed. Unlike other similar initiatives we are developing this to be open and available to all, with the goal of providing curriculum and educational specialists a powerful tool test and validate their approaches.


The learning world interface: In this phase we will also begin building the game layer interface that will engage children and inspire them to explore. An interesting and exciting learning world game layer is a key component that will keep children engaged, learning and continually wanting to come back for more.  


The learning world future: To help us down this road we have partnered with Strangeloop games, the amazing team behind the successfully funded ECO game. As part of our work to build a learning world game engine we are working with this team. Parts of the game world will start to take shape in this phase of the project thanks to your generous contributions.

Here are some of the Images from ECO to illustrate the direction we are moving in for the game world through which children will access learning activities and stealth assessments.


 
 
 





Questions and Answers

Are you a non-profit? Can I write-off my contribution with my taxes? Yes, Dev4X INCORPORATED is a registered 501(c)(3) charity (EIN 47-2367984). You will receive tax receipts for your donations through the crowdfunding campaign.
Why are you crowdfunding?We believe the quickest way to tackle this grand challenge is with open collaboration. This crowdfunding campaign is a great way by which we can rally the support of many people from around the world. It is also a way of showcasing our efforts to larger organizations intending to fund this project that there is strong global backing for a radically new and open approach to tackling this challenge. 
What if you raise more money than what is requested here?This campaign is to raise funds for phase two, additional funds will assist us to move into further phases of the project, and accelerate the impact we can achieve.

How will the money be used, and how can I track the progress?As an open project, we are transparent with our efforts. You can follow our continued progress via our website blog, on social media and see the real world impact your donation is making. The funds raised in this campaign will go to developing phase two of the platform and working in East Africa. Over the next year, our aim is to deploy to a few thousand children, many of whom will be reached through our pilot in Tanzania being run by our head of pedagogy, Natalie Denmeade. Her progress can be followed through a series we are posting on our blog and social pages which can be followed through this link. 

Why not raise funds from NGO's and Governments?We are raising funds from multiple sources, including NGO's and Governments, however, we are purposefully being very cautious because many of these sources are filled with bureaucracy, inefficiency, politics and in many cases corruption. We are staying true to our mission and concentrating on what's most important, the children. This is also why crowdfunding is such a powerful option. In the short term this strategy makes things more difficult but in the long term it's what's going to allow us to succeed where so many others get stuck in politics, protectionism, short term thinking and pandering to the status quo.
How are you different to other initiatives? Some of the key innovations that are setting us apart are: 


Our radically open approach. Developing an open platform with a sustainable long term strategy in place allows us to both rapidly engage the world's expertise but also sustain it with a self-funding business model. 
We are building our platform to work both online and offline. Therefore, participation in online collaboration would be offered in both synchronous and asynchronous modes. 
Our underlying platform foundation is built on highly scalable architecture and utilizes a dynamic open learning map that allows it to be rapidly extended to any curriculum, language or outcome, and adapted to each child. While there are a few such learning maps, most are based on closed-ended, siloed business models that do not allow them to be interoperable or they are focused on specific domains. We are creating an open version that many can contribute to and anyone can use. It will provide unmatched opportunity to derive meaningful metrics on each step of the children's learning experience across multiple curriculums and learning paths to find what works best for each individual child. Over time, we see it as the goto curriculum resource for any educator to validate what works. This would be the first time such a powerful resource would be available openly. 

Dev4x innovations include mesh networking, offline mobile AI and Machine learning, Offline mobile learning management and a data structure that is focused on privacy.


How will you keep children engaged?The Dev4x open learning map underlies a quest based learning journey that is designed to keep children engaged, and motivated through gamification. Through the use of mesh networking technology, the platform utilizes social tools to facilitate collaborative learning opportunities even when offline, encouraging the children to teach each other.(You can read more about that on our technology page: under mentorship and social learning)
How is Dev4X currently funded?Our Core team and the over 200 volunteers are currently all non-remunerated. We are currently self-financed and funded to a small degree through individual donations and some grants from foundations like the Shuttleworth Foundation. We are actively raising capital from foundations, high net worth philanthropists, and individuals with the intention to secure funds for the core team and our efforts.

What is the technology vision?In this phase we will be building the underlying infrastructure to support our long-term vision of the project that includes features like Voice recognition, machine learning and AI support to help guide and empower the children.

Nous donnons suite à notre première campagne Indiegogo en Avril qui avait pour but de poser un plancher à notre nouveau Dojo. Mission accomplie ! Merci pour votre soutien ! Aujourd'hui comme annoncé, nous lançons une deuxième campagne pour financer les travaux restants : construire un vestiaire femme, un vestiaire homme, une douche, un deuxième sanitaire et équiper la salle.



We are pursuing our first
Indiegogo campaign (last April), which purpose was to put a wooden
floor in our new Dojo.  Mission acomplished ! Thank you for your
support ! Today, as we advertised, we are launching another
campaign to fund the remaining work : building two locker rooms
(for men and women), a shower block, a second toilet block, and
purchasing furnitures for the main room.


Notre
Projet / Our project
Nous ouvrons un Dojo d'arts martiaux internes à Loos,
près de Lille (Nord de la France). Un Dojo est un lieu pour
""trouver sa propre voie, l'étudier et la pratiquer"". De
manière originale, notre école réunira dans un même centre :


des cours et des
	stages de Kung-Fu Bagua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Qi Gong, Tai Ji Quan et
	Dao Yin pour enfants, jeunes et adultes.


des séances et
	ateliers de Shiatsu (thérapie manuelle et énergétique
	japonaise) 
	


des stages pluridisciplinaires
	(calligraphie chinoise, yoga, etc.) 


une bibliothèque de livres sur
	les arts énergétiques et martiaux 
	


des conférences sur le Shiatsu,
	le Feng Shui, les médecines naturelles, etc. 
	
	

des rencontres autour d'initiatives
	alternatives favorisant le respect de la Nature, de l'être humain
	et de sa santé






We are opening a martial arts Dojo in Loos, near Lille
(north of France). A Dojo is a place to ""find one's own
path, study it and practice it"". In an original way, our school
will combine in the same place :


Classes and workshops about
	Kung-Fu Bagua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Qi Gong, Tai Ji Quan and Dao Yin for children, youngsters and adults.

 
	


Shiatsu sessions and workshop
	(hand and energetic japanese technique)


Multidisciplinary workshops
	(chinese calligraphy, yoga...) 
	


A library of books about energetic
	and martial arts 
	


Conferences about Shiatsu, Feng
	Shui, natural medicines... 
	


Meetings to discuss alternative initiatives about respecting
	human beings, their health, and nature 
	



Notre but / Our goal
""Un esprit sain dans un corps sain"" !

Depuis 10 ans, notre école donne des clés pour
développer un mode de vie plus équilibré et plus harmonieux. C'est
essentiel pour les enfants, les jeunes et aussi pour les adultes dans
la société actuelle !
Nous proposons une pratique de santé et/ou une
pratique martiale. La base est commune : apprendre à habiter
correctement son corps (ancrage, respiration, postures, détente), à
retrouver une vraie souplesse dans le mouvement et à connaître son
énergie pour la canaliser. La pratique permet de se découvrir et de
développer certaines qualités (concentration, calme, confiance en
soi, etc.).



""A healthy mind in a healthy body""

For
10 years now our school has been giving keys to develop a more
balanced and harmonious lifestyle. It is essential for kids,
teenagers and also adults in our society! 

We propose a health practice as well as a martial
one. They have a common basis : to learn to correctly inhabit one's
body (rooting, breathing, postures, relaxation), to recover a real
fluidity in motion and know one's energy to channel it. The practice
allows one to discover oneself and develop some skills
(concentration, calm, self-confidence...)

construire un vestiaire homme et un vestiaire femme

une douche, 

un deuxième sanitaire

 équiper la salle (extincteurs, sac de frappe, etc.) 
	





Ces travaux sont estimés à 10 000

<p></p>
<p>
Erastus wasn’t going to get into his favorite college until he learned how to write a great essay. </p>
<p>He’s the kind of kid top colleges are scrambling for.

He came to Lynn, a struggling city outside of Boston, from Kenya. His father had died when he was twelve; his mother had cancer. And despite these challenges,  Erastus was a great student, had a positive outlook on life, and cared deeply about  people.  </p>
<p>Yes, he’d faced significant challenges. Yes, he’d overcome adversity and developed a positive, empowering attitude in the process. Yes, it was clear he was an intelligent, capable student. </p>
<p>But his essay was a bit of a downer. </p>
<p><b>In telling his story, he fell into several of the many common essay traps that can keep kids from college.
</b></p>
<p>Using what he learned with Essay Mentors, Erastus found a better way to share his story. Ultimately, in <a href=""http://www.essaymentors.com/2015/04/michelangelos-sistine-chapel-saved-life/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the essay he submitted</a>, his love of art, his role in his community, his creativity and his desire to contribute all shine through.</p>
<p>And because of that essay, <b>Erastus had his choice of some of the most selective colleges in the country. </b>He will be a sophomore this fall at Tufts University. </p>
<p><span style=""color: #2D99EA;""><b>We're launching Essay Mentors Online this fall so that every high school student—maybe even yours—can write a great essay. Just like Erastus did.</b></span></p>

<p>For some kids, college is a done deal; for many, many more it’s a stretch. A thoughtful, quality personal essay can be the key to college admissions, merit scholarships, and financial aid. </p>
<p>Over a million kids a year write college essays. Most of those essays don't help; only a handful of fortunate students get effective support or feedback. Erastus got that support through an Essay Mentors pilot program at RAW Art Works..</p>

the Northwest are seeking us out. We’ve led free
workshops in the Seattle area for more than 1,400 students and parents. This year we're doing a pilot project in Norwalk, Connecticut. Forty of their volunteer mentors and teachers are being trained in our process, and 600 seniors will be writing better essays. We’re also partnering with the Issaquah Schools Foundation and other nonprofits to develop
and expand our pilot programs.<br/>

</div></div>","CAMPAIGN UPDATE: Great news! We've raised enough to launch a limited beta version in late October to help this year's seniors with application deadlines in December and January. 

If kids want to get into their first choice college, they need to write really good essays.


That's why we're building Essay Mentors Online.  



Erastus wasn’t going to get into his favorite college until he learned how to write a great essay. 
He’s the kind of kid top colleges are scrambling for.

He came to Lynn, a struggling city outside of Boston, from Kenya. His father had died when he was twelve; his mother had cancer. And despite these challenges,  Erastus was a great student, had a positive outlook on life, and cared deeply about  people.  
Yes, he’d faced significant challenges. Yes, he’d overcome adversity and developed a positive, empowering attitude in the process. Yes, it was clear he was an intelligent, capable student. 
But his essay was a bit of a downer. 
In telling his story, he fell into several of the many common essay traps that can keep kids from college.

Using what he learned with Essay Mentors, Erastus found a better way to share his story. Ultimately, in the essay he submitted, his love of art, his role in his community, his creativity and his desire to contribute all shine through.
And because of that essay, Erastus had his choice of some of the most selective colleges in the country. He will be a sophomore this fall at Tufts University. 
We're launching Essay Mentors Online this fall so that every high school student—maybe even yours—can write a great essay. Just like Erastus did.













For some kids, college is a done deal; for many, many more it’s a stretch. A thoughtful, quality personal essay can be the key to college admissions, merit scholarships, and financial aid. 
Over a million kids a year write college essays. Most of those essays don't help; only a handful of fortunate students get effective support or feedback. Erastus got that support through an Essay Mentors pilot program at RAW Art Works..








Essay Mentors helps students from all walks of life write better college essays, essays that help them compete and get accepted into the colleges where they can thrive. 
Last year we mentored 150 students, but with your help, we'll be able to launch our online program this fall and grow the number of schools and nonprofits we can train in our process. 
 





Essay Mentors Online is a virtual mentor that guides kids through our teen-tested, college acceptance-proven process. For the first time, every  high school student will have the opportunity to compete with their best college essay.   
(Don't know what makes a great college essay? We have plenty of them on our website. They're engaging, entertaining and profound short stories that reveal wonderful aspects of these teenagers.)  


Our goal this year is to help 1,000 high school students write better college essays. And, we'll train 60 teachers and volunteers to support kids in schools and nonprofits.  We're laying the foundation to help more than 100,000 kids in the next 5 years. 




Schools and nonprofit organizations from the Northeast to
the Northwest are seeking us out. We’ve led free
workshops in the Seattle area for more than 1,400 students and parents. This year we're doing a pilot project in Norwalk, Connecticut. Forty of their volunteer mentors and teachers are being trained in our process, and 600 seniors will be writing better essays. We’re also partnering with the Issaquah Schools Foundation and other nonprofits to develop
and expand our pilot programs.



In July we're going back to Lynn, Massachusetts for a third year in a row. We'll lead workshops for students from three nonprofits and will train volunteer mentors to support them through the process. 
 

What We Need
In this first
stage, we need $25,000 to build the beta version of Essay Mentors Online and to conduct mentor
and teacher training in partner locations throughout the country.
When we exceed that
goal, we will extend our reach even farther (and we are poised and ready to go).




Why do we
need this money?
First, we need to build the online application. The content,
the process, our proven system is ready to go, we just need to hire the
programmers to build out the back-end, so we can launch the program this fall
for the hundreds of kids already lining up for it.
The more funds we bring in, the more we can do. Meeting our $25,000 goal will set us up to
expand from 1,000 kids this year to 100,000 in the next 5 years. 



We’re a social purpose corporation, and the purpose in our
charter is to help kids from at-risk, disadvantaged, or under-served populations
get into college. By joining the campaign you’re supporting that mission.
And, we are already working with partners to help us
leverage our resources. Your donation will fund staffing, research, and travel
to work with our partner organizations, building a powerful nationwide network
to bring this work to where the kids need it most.

This is a great way to support your high school student if you have one, and other teenagers if
you don’t. Either way, you’re helping build the future of deserving kids.



Beyond money— we need your help spreading the word
At its heart, Essay Mentors is about students exploring who they are, telling their stories, and having more and better options for college and beyond. 
Ways you can help:

Let high school students or their parents know about Essay Mentors--they'll thank you for it.
Spread the word about this campaign on Facebook.
Share our information with a local high school, non-profit, school foundation or PTA.
Stay connected. Follow Essay Mentors on Facebook and on Twitter to receive information about the college process, writing and more.




Recognizing your generosity. Thank you!

The work we do touches students’ lives in a meaningful way. Every dollar you give touches student's lives. We thank you, and so do the students.

</div><p><b>What issues have we seen?</b></p><p>Education
is the baseline for economic growth and sustainability. It is the backbone of a
growing nation. The establishment of a strong curriculum and the appointment of
highly skilled teachers are keys to the development of the education system.
The problem is that even the best education system only helps if the children
stay in school. To help limit the problem, at least in Marurui, we had to first
understand what was going on. That meant research. What that showed is that
most kids needed an extra incentive to stay in school. A lack of food was often
the issue for them and so the thought was, if we give them food there then they
will stay there too. Based on this research our project last year focused on
getting kids of the street and back into school, using food as an extra incentive.
This resulted in us supporting 15 children through their school year. Of the
original 15, 14 have stayed in the program. One of the children never showed up
for school, but we are doing everything in our power to track him down. For the
time being his place has been taken by another student that required aid. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>What is Muyog doing to change it?</b></p>
<p>In the
first run of the education program (then named feeding program) we had an issue
with parental involvement and parental responsibility. We came to this
realization after the interviews with teachers, parents, and the children as a
part of the evaluation of the program. This has made us understand that
embarking on the issue from the child’s side alone is not enough. We must also
assist the parents. Many parents here have their children at such a young age
that they do not really know how to go about raising them. They do the best
they can but often resort to the same methods as their parents used. This
rarely results in progress. To accommodate the parents we have established parenting
lessons to help them learn how they can better support their children, as well
as developing better communication with the school, their children and Muyog.
We have also brought them on board in the further development of the program
with in depth talks about how the program is structured and where the funding
comes from. The second addition that we have made to the program is the
introduction of a revolving fund. This is an essential development. By offering
a micro financial system we can now assist families to grow economically. This
would enable them to grow out of our program on a sustainable income. Something
that right now none of our families have, as can be seen in the case studies  (these are available upon request). The revolving
fund also has the capability of launching the program from donor dependency to
a self-sustaining system.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What do we need?</b></p>
<p>To give
these families and this program a brighter future we will need your help and
your donations. The goal has been set at 15000 euros. After donating we
encourage you to spread the word and record your own give them a chance shout-out
to help spread the message as widely as possible. (For more insight into the
way the funds will be spent the budget is available upon request). </p>

most kids needed an extra incentive to stay in school. A lack of food was often
the issue for them and so the thought was, if we give them food there then they
will stay there too. Based on this research our project last year focused on
getting kids of the street and back into school, using food as an extra incentive.
This resulted in us supporting 15 children through their school year. Of the
original 15, 14 have stayed in the program. One of the children never showed up
for school, but we are doing everything in our power to track him down. For the
time being his place has been taken by another student that required aid. What is Muyog doing to change it?
In the
first run of the education program (then named feeding program) we had an issue
with parental involvement and parental responsibility. We came to this
realization after the interviews with teachers, parents, and the children as a
part of the evaluation of the program. This has made us understand that
embarking on the issue from the child’s side alone is not enough. We must also
assist the parents. Many parents here have their children at such a young age
that they do not really know how to go about raising them. They do the best
they can but often resort to the same methods as their parents used. This
rarely results in progress. To accommodate the parents we have established parenting
lessons to help them learn how they can better support their children, as well
as developing better communication with the school, their children and Muyog.
We have also brought them on board in the further development of the program
with in depth talks about how the program is structured and where the funding
comes from. The second addition that we have made to the program is the
introduction of a revolving fund. This is an essential development. By offering
a micro financial system we can now assist families to grow economically. This
would enable them to grow out of our program on a sustainable income. Something
that right now none of our families have, as can be seen in the case studies  (these are available upon request). The revolving
fund also has the capability of launching the program from donor dependency to
a self-sustaining system.What do we need?
To give
these families and this program a brighter future we will need your help and
your donations. The goal has been set at 15000 euros. After donating we
encourage you to spread the word and record your own give them a chance shout-out
to help spread the message as widely as possible. (For more insight into the
way the funds will be spent the budget is available upon request).

We are hoping to raise $2500 to fund the following:  Airfare for 1 staff member, 1 mentor, and 1 mentee Hotel room for 3 nights
Food costs for 3 days 
Every little bit helps!! This is a great opportunity for the program to publicize their emerging model of transformational and intergenerational mentorship, and for mentors and mentees to further develop presenting skills and network with others involved in similar work.   

    Other Ways You Can Help And if you can't contribute to this fundraising effort, please consider volunteering for the program, especially if you are/were a young mother. We are always in need of passionate and inspiring individuals to share their experiences with students and discuss how they have faced and overcome various challenges and obstacles.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Arizona Puppet Theater</span></a><i> IMAGINE THIS is a collaborative 2-part annual project with our
neighbor, Kenilworth Elementary School, which takes 14 original stories and
turns them into professional puppet shows! Stories are turned in on October 2nd with performances in November.</i></p>
<p><b>PART I:</b></p>
<p>Children in 2nd - 8th grades put their creative thinking caps on and
write stories about themselves, their communities, aliens, purple sea monsters,
you name it! </p>
<p>Volunteers from the community then select 2 stories from each grade
level to be converted into professional puppet shows at the Great Arizona
Puppet Theater (GAPT). All Kenilworth students can come
and see the shows for FREE!</p>
<p>During the run at the theater more than 500 Kenilworth students experience the theater and the work of their classmates, who are
always recognized publicly for their accomplishments. In addition, the authors
of the selected stories enjoy a special AUTHORS PARTY held on an evening where
friends and family are invited to see the stories enacted, and the
participating children receive certificates, a commemorative book with pictures
of the authors and puppets, and prizes donated by neighborhood businesses. More
than 100 children, family, and friends came out to the 2014 Author's Party!</p>
<p><b>PART II:</b></p>
<p>The second part of this project was developed when Kenilworth students
told us they wanted to learn to make puppets and do shows too. So of course GAPT jumped on board and created YOUNG PUPPETEERS, which
targets 20 children enrolled in the PEER After School Program. Initially, they help make puppets and props for the IMAGINE THIS
production; next they move on to building their own puppets. They then present
puppet shows for other children in the PEER program and their families. YOUNG PUPPETEERS also join us at the special Authors Party with their
families to be recognized for their contributions to the production, and of
course to have plenty of fun! </p>
<p>These robust workshops are led by professional GAPT puppeteers and the
kids get to learn about different styles of puppetry, how puppetry is used and
performed in different cultures, and how to make their own puppets and develop
a show for performance.</p>

</b></h3><p></p>
<p>IMAGINE THIS is one of our favorite projects because it makes the
puppet theater a part of the life of the neighborhood and builds community
relations. Teachers and students smile and wave when we visit Kenilworth or run
into them at the grocery store or neighborhood park. During classroom visits,
the children tell us about their favorite IMAGINE THIS stories from years past
and we love meeting their parents and seeing how proud they are of their
children’s creative accomplishments.</p>
<p>At Kenilworth Elementary School, where 27% of the children are English
Language Learners, there is an emphasis on developing literacy skills. Teachers
tie the IMAGINE THIS program into curriculum and educational standards as it
encourages  writing. For instance, in
fourth grade, children learn to develop a story draft and make changes before
the final version is submitted. Other teachers
emphasize vocabulary development, story sequencing, and other key language
skills.</p>
<p>This is an exceptionally special and unique experience for so many
students. For example, one classroom teacher showed us a handwritten letter
from a shy 2nd grade boy who’d taken the time to
create an invitation to the Authors’Party for his
instructor and school counselor, so they could see his story DINO VILLAGE
enacted. Teachers have told us that the field trip to IMAGINE THIS is their
favorite activity of the year and YOUNG PUPPETEERS from last year are asking
when we are coming back. <b><i>HELP US COME BACK!</i></b><b></b></p>
<p><i>Some facts for the academics out there:</i></p>
<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated evidence connecting student
learning in the arts to academic and social benefits. In <i>Critical Links:

researcher James Catterall reports of at-risk students, “…a tendency for the arts to promote both certain competencies for
children who struggle across the curriculum as well as genuinely grounded
feelings of competence and engagement.” A. Helene Robinson’s recent (2013) research-based article, <i>Arts Integration and the
Success of Disadvantaged Students: A Research Evaluation</i>, suggests that
perceptive thinking skills derived from arts education implementation can
become a strategic component for planning instruction that enhances learning
for Common Core Standards. </p>

The ISOS Center for Social Responsibility is a non profit corporation that works to advance global commitments for a common, more sustainable future. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We first started ISOS with the vision of helping create a more sustainable future through transparency. Education was key to driving the charge.</span> <div>
<p></p>
<p>We've since laid the foundations for reporting in the U.S. by training non-profits, international and federal agencies, small and large corporations alike. To make an even greater impact, we believe it's time to expand that call by facilitating awareness and skills development within a larger community.</p>
<h5><span style=""color: #f82574;""><br/></span></h5>
<h5><span style=""color: #f82574;"">AFRICA</span></h5>
<span style=""line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">With global recognition and strong partnerships in hand, we're packing our tool kits for an adventure of a lifetime. In Spring of 2016, our experts will fly to Ghana and Kenya to deliver extended Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and  CDP Trainings to improve disclosure in the region. In reflecting on our initial moves to raise awareness, tapping into the academic community was essential. We're starting fresh in Africa- and making the trainings accessible to African academics will again, serve as the entry point to those who will essentially, create change.</span>
<p></p>No contribution is too small. Every bit counts! Through this campaign, we aim to provide 10 scholarships in each country. Will you help us achieve our goal?<h5><span style=""color: #f82574;""><br/></span></h5>
<h5><span style=""color: #f82574;"">WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</span></h5>
<p>Here's the breakdown....<br/></p> <ul> <li>By contributing you will build a scholarship pool of $10,000 - waiving the costs of tuition and materials for 20 African academics to attend the certified sustainability reporting trainings in Ghana and Kenya.</li> <li>Influence the lives of participants directly by giving them an opportunity to enhance their skillset in this space, contribute to larger social-economic development in their communities and meet larger international sustainability objectives.<br/>
</li> <li>If we don't reach our goal, we will award scholarships based on funds received....and hope to increase contributions next year!</li>
<li>Contributors will receive an extra 10% off at any of our future in-person or online trainings!</li>
<li>Of course, we'll also let you live vicariously through our adventures. We will regularly share blogs, photos and lessons-learned along the way.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h5><span style=""color: #f82574;""><br/></span></h5><h5><span style=""color: #f82574;"">THE IMPACT</span></h5>
<p>The case for trainings of this kind stem primarily from
international sustainability commitments from U.N. Agencies, implementation
measures mandated by national governments and through standards set by major
global companies. Credibility stemming from conscious, honest and reliable
reporting of environmental, social and governance measures (ESG) according to
global standards can result in secured contracts for goods and services that
are conducted ethically.</p>
We hope to support efforts in Africa by advancing
transparency across global value chains; through impact identification, sound
measurement techniques and stakeholder communication. We are not only striving to enhance resiliency, but to spark innovation in the process as well.
<div><br/></div> <div>
<h5><span style=""color: #f82574;"">RISKS AND CHALLENGES</span></h5>
<p> There's always the risk of jumping to the scene prematurely. When we started pounding the pavement in the U.S. to the sustainability tune, we regularly received the ""you're crazy"" card. Fast forward, 72% of the S&amp;P 500 are now publishing sustainability reports, the government is behind certain measures and the term is part of our general lexicon. <br/></p>
<p>We understand that an effort of this kind will take time and undying determination. We'll have to be creative in our approach and sensitive to local contexts. We'll also have to provide as many tools as possible to reduce the burden of reporting on those who are much more concerned with issues so foreign to most the developed world. We're ready for the challenge and we can't imagine any other group being prepared to take on this role. <br/></p>
<p>We're excited- and humbled by the opportunity. We hope you are too!</p>

<br/></div>","SHORT SUMMARY
The ISOS Center for Social Responsibility is a non profit corporation that works to advance global commitments for a common, more sustainable future. We first started ISOS with the vision of helping create a more sustainable future through transparency. Education was key to driving the charge. 

We've since laid the foundations for reporting in the U.S. by training non-profits, international and federal agencies, small and large corporations alike. To make an even greater impact, we believe it's time to expand that call by facilitating awareness and skills development within a larger community.

AFRICA
With global recognition and strong partnerships in hand, we're packing our tool kits for an adventure of a lifetime. In Spring of 2016, our experts will fly to Ghana and Kenya to deliver extended Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and  CDP Trainings to improve disclosure in the region. In reflecting on our initial moves to raise awareness, tapping into the academic community was essential. We're starting fresh in Africa- and making the trainings accessible to African academics will again, serve as the entry point to those who will essentially, create change.
No contribution is too small. Every bit counts! Through this campaign, we aim to provide 10 scholarships in each country. Will you help us achieve our goal?
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
Here's the breakdown....  By contributing you will build a scholarship pool of $10,000 - waiving the costs of tuition and materials for 20 African academics to attend the certified sustainability reporting trainings in Ghana and Kenya. Influence the lives of participants directly by giving them an opportunity to enhance their skillset in this space, contribute to larger social-economic development in their communities and meet larger international sustainability objectives.
 If we don't reach our goal, we will award scholarships based on funds received....and hope to increase contributions next year!
Contributors will receive an extra 10% off at any of our future in-person or online trainings!
Of course, we'll also let you live vicariously through our adventures. We will regularly share blogs, photos and lessons-learned along the way.


THE IMPACT
The case for trainings of this kind stem primarily from
international sustainability commitments from U.N. Agencies, implementation
measures mandated by national governments and through standards set by major
global companies. Credibility stemming from conscious, honest and reliable
reporting of environmental, social and governance measures (ESG) according to
global standards can result in secured contracts for goods and services that
are conducted ethically.
We hope to support efforts in Africa by advancing
transparency across global value chains; through impact identification, sound
measurement techniques and stakeholder communication. We are not only striving to enhance resiliency, but to spark innovation in the process as well.
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
 There's always the risk of jumping to the scene prematurely. When we started pounding the pavement in the U.S. to the sustainability tune, we regularly received the ""you're crazy"" card. Fast forward, 72% of the S&P 500 are now publishing sustainability reports, the government is behind certain measures and the term is part of our general lexicon. 
We understand that an effort of this kind will take time and undying determination. We'll have to be creative in our approach and sensitive to local contexts. We'll also have to provide as many tools as possible to reduce the burden of reporting on those who are much more concerned with issues so foreign to most the developed world. We're ready for the challenge and we can't imagine any other group being prepared to take on this role. 
We're excited- and humbled by the opportunity. We hope you are too!

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
If you can't contribute right now, you can still support this campaign in one of the following ways:
  
Let us  know if you have subsidiaries or partners on the ground who would be willing to provide guest presentations.
Know of other funding source avenues we can apply to help cover costs for African academics.
Please circulate information about our trainings, offered in partnership with AMC- Africa: 
GHANA // May 2016
KENYA // May 2016
  And that's all there is to it. Don't hesitate to write us with any questions and/or thoughts you might have! info@isoscsr.org

<h3>In-Flight Movie<br/>
</h3> <p><i>Headwinds</i> is a web series in five episodes - a <i>drama</i> about three Hollywood friends creating a <i>sitcom</i> about a startup airline for a major TV network.  Each of them are tired of working on empty shows, and has a dream of creating something special, something of substance.</p>
<p>Of course, other people's ideas often get in the way of their dreams.</p>
<p>As we watch those dreams unravel behind the scenes in the drama, we get to watch the hilarious characters and situations of the sitcom develop in front of the cameras, like the name of their airline.  It's called ""Bagle Air"" because they painted the name ""Eagle Air"" on their one plane, then discovered that name was already taken.  So they just filled in the ends of the ""E"".</p>
<p>Pressure grows in each episode of the drama as day-to-day challenges are faced, and across the entire series as the three friends wait to hear the verdict about their sitcom: <i>will the audience respond to their dream-show, and will the network buy it?<br/></i></p>

<h3>Assembly Line<br/>
</h3>
<p>The Film School provides all the cameras, lights, dollies, and space we need to film most anything.  But the size and shape of <i>Headwinds</i> requires just a little bit more than the usual to produce. <br/></p>
<p>So we're looking for help to buy film equipment we don't have but need for this project. It's called a Steadicam, and will give us the freedom, flexibility,  and network-look necessary for this show.  It's how most of the dramas on TV are shot because it gives a steady look to the picture, but is also a much faster way of shooting.  It's something we need to know and understand if we're going to work in this industry.  </p>
<p>Our goal is $3900, which is the cost of that equipment. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>No student or faculty member is paid for this or any other project we do.  In fact, the faculty donate their time to 
help us learn on these extra-curricular films.<br/></p>
<p>In exchange for your help, we'd like <i>you</i> to be a part of the process -- be an extra on our airliner, name the plane, receive a signed air-sick bag from the cast and crew, or even direct a scene.</p>
<p>You'll have fun, and if you do join us on-set, you'll see exactly how a Hollywood film is made, because our director and his colleagues insist that everything we do is done at the highest level of professionalism, as if we were working on any mega-movie in Hollywood.  That's the work ethic they're instilling in us.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Flight Schedule<br/>
</h3>
<p>Each episode will be shot over a weekend and edited in the following two weeks, then released.  So we'll release a new episode on YouTube and everywhere else every three or four weeks, from October to March or April.  <br/></p>
<p>Even if you can't help us financially, please spread the word about this campaign - and about the premier of <i>Headwinds</i> - through all means possible.  Then watch our Facebook page for news and updates.  </p>
<p>
</p>

¿A quiénes buscamos? Inversionistas de IMPACTO.Un inversionista de impacto promueve iniciativas emprendedoras que junto con la creación de riqueza y empleo se plantean deliberadamente la producción de un beneficio para la sociedad. 

Meta: $5000 El objetivo de la meta es financiar 7ma y 8va Edición del Social Shot Costa Rica,  las cuales se estarán llevando a cabo en Marzo y Septiembre 2016.




 Las recompensas están basadas en conocimiento, con el objetivo de promover emprendimientos de alto valor agregado y potencial de crecimiento, lo cuales los estarán impartiendo actores claves del ecosistema nacional. (Felipe Castro Truque, Alejandro Egea, Melissa Monge, Leandro Camacho, Daniel Carranza, Juan Carlos Arce, Juan Carlos Martí, entre muchos otros más). 
 Todos los fondos recaudados* se utilizarán para las próximas dos ediciones del 2016. *Una vez recaudado el 100% de la meta los fondos extras serán destinados a la creación de un fondo de capital semilla para emprendedores sociales. 
    Impacto Cada dólar genera IMPACTO. El emprendimiento social es una prueba mas de cómo la investigación es una herramienta al servicio del conocimiento y del conocimiento para la acción. Confiamos en que esta innovadora vía de resolver las problemáticas sociales amplíe y profundice en el futuro una extraordinaria importancia estratégica en el desarrollo económico y progreso social de las naciones.   ¿En qué contribuye esta iniciativa al planeta?En un momento de cambio como el actual , de replanteamientos, de pensar en profundidad y sin dramatismo sobre por qué las cosas no han funcionado como esperábamos, constituye una gran oportunidad para que al mismo tiempo que creamos valor económico también generemos valor social.

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">In light of the suffering, disease,
stress, lies, and fear in the world today, we are attempting to create a
new model for humanity to follow, which looks at our feelings as tools for
self-improvement, instead of obstacles to overcome. We are not attempting to
separate ourselves from common society, but rather, illustrate how a new model for
living within it, can provide the confidence, security, and peace that we all seek,
without the stresses that normally come along with it.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">How great would it feel to wake up
on your own time EVERY morning, feeling not only refreshed and well-rested, but
actually excited about taking on your day? What if you could have all the same
utilities you have now, but without spending money on them every month? Can you
imagine eating fresh produce that has ripened on the plant with all of the
flavor and nutrients that nature intended us to have, without ever stepping foot in
a grocery store or even leaving your own home?</p>

**We are currently in the process of incorporating our project as an official non-profit educational facility. Your contributions are tax deductible!**INTRODUCTIONSo far, we have tried to fund this project ourselves, but with recent hard economic times and our family emergency issues of the past year, we are hoping that there are people out there who share our vision of a sustainable and harmonious future, and are willing to help us complete our goals here in upstate NY.OUR MISSIONTo demonstrate how living in harmony with Nature can provide an abundance of health and happiness, and also the same comfort and luxury of our modern era, while eliminating many unnecessary side-effects.


STOP SURVIVING, BEGIN THRIVING
Does being human really require us waking up before dawn to get ready for a job? Have anxiety, fear, stress, and fatigue become a daily part of the ""human condition""? Do disease and old-age go hand-in-hand now? These are some of the many questions we asked ourselves before starting this project; after we had lost many friends and relatives to cancer, diabetes, depression and other horrors, and realized that we too, were on the same path.

After careful study we discovered that a human being’s “needs” are relatively easy to fulfill and the means for them are readily available in Nature all around us - Nature, that we, humans, seem to separate ourselves from. However, there seemed to exist no clear model or road-map to follow for someone looking to reconnect, and thus the project began.

In light of the suffering, disease,
stress, lies, and fear in the world today, we are attempting to create a
new model for humanity to follow, which looks at our feelings as tools for
self-improvement, instead of obstacles to overcome. We are not attempting to
separate ourselves from common society, but rather, illustrate how a new model for
living within it, can provide the confidence, security, and peace that we all seek,
without the stresses that normally come along with it.
How great would it feel to wake up
on your own time EVERY morning, feeling not only refreshed and well-rested, but
actually excited about taking on your day? What if you could have all the same
utilities you have now, but without spending money on them every month? Can you
imagine eating fresh produce that has ripened on the plant with all of the
flavor and nutrients that nature intended us to have, without ever stepping foot in
a grocery store or even leaving your own home?



Progress in technology and forward-thinking has
taken us to a place today, where judicious application of available tools and
technology enables us to achieve the integration with Nature that we are
seeking, and end the struggle to overcome Her at every turn.
WHAT WE'RE DOINGFor the past 4 years my family and I have been working hard to build our new home as well as our living, off-the-grid, self-sustainable, aquaponic, bioenergy, greenhouse facility. Whew, that is a mouthful!My family and I have carefully
researched and employed the most cutting-edge designs developed by NASA
engineers in order to create a facility smart enough to be built for the International Space Station and yet at the same time easily and
efficiently sustain human life.  Above is a photo of the ""Island One"", the very same facility that our bio-energy greenhouse was designed after. Notice the rings of algae and the fragmented parabolic reflector surrounding it; these are the very same tools that we will be employing here in Livingston Manor.The 60 foot diameter greenhouse is designed with room for over 600 organic and aquaponic fruit and vegetable plants, a host of fresh-water organic fish, gourmet mushroom logs, fresh-water organic clams, and hundreds of gallons of fresh organic compost.The large moat on the interior of the greenhouse contains large amounts of organic matter and algae which will not only act as nutrients for plant growth and fish food, but will also be collected in an anaerobic digester and turned into natural gas. This gas will be used to run a generator as well as any natural gas appliances, allowing for near complete self-sufficiency.When our project is complete enough,
we hope to open our doors as an educational facility to teach interested people
about the many different ways we will be utilizing nature to provide as many comforts
for ourselves as we can, such as clean water, sustainable electricity, fresh
organic produce, and much more!This is hopefully the beginning of a global network of self-sustainable, living eco-sanctuaries! The money we are asking for will allow us to realize our vision for the future here on our property, at least for the 2015 warm season. To be completely honest, our dreams and visions are endless and we plan on spending the rest of our lives adding to this sanctuary, so this is a never ending campaign.

PHILOSOPHY
Our goal - Has now become, to integrate ourselves back into the natural life and world that we have denied ourselves of for our entire lives, and to illustrate the freedom, power, and creativity that this lifestyle and philosophy provides.
Why? - To assist our government, as well as the rest of the world, by taking the fear out of the self-sustainable lifestyle and empowering and inspiring people to take their lives into their own hands by creatively using their time to directly better their own lives - when more people become self-sufficient, there will be less stress on governments and the private sectors to provide jobs, and once again high-quality, hand-made products and services will be available to the public.

<p></p>
<h3><b>OUR CORE VALUES</b></h3>
<p><i>Play-based learning</i><br/>We believe that children should be allowed to develop at their own pace and to the fullest of their ability.​ We believe that by having choice in play, they learn and grow in their own unique way.​ This develops important skills that lay the foundations for reading, writing and mathematics, problem-solving and decision-making, social and emotional growth and many other skills needed throughout their lives.</p>
<p><i>Environmental Sustainability</i><br/>We believe that it is our responsibility to care for and protect our environment. We believe that this desire to preserve our natural spaces begins by developing our innate curiosities and nurturing our bodies by spending as much time outside as possible. Our aim is to create a learning environment that captivates little minds without overwhelming or over stimulating them.</p>
<p><i>Parent Involvement</i><br/>We believe that parent involvement in preschool fosters a child’s sense of self-worth and security, and strengthens parenting skills. We value the importance of family and community in our children’s development. As the parents and teacher work together to build trust and confidence in the children, a strong future is gained for your child and our community at large.</p>
<p><i>Community Involvement</i><br/>We believe in the importance of family and active participation in the community. Monthly field trips, family days and activities that include siblings and participation in community events are a few of the ways that we make this part of our program a reality for our children.<br/><br/></p>

<span>WHY FOREST SCHOOL?<br/><div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify; background-color: initial;"">We believe that today's children are spending less time outside and more time indoors engaged in technology-driven activities. </span></div></span>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We believe that as parents and educators, it is our responsibility to steer our children away from this ""nature-deficit-disorder"" (LOUV, 2005). </span></p>Since launching our forest school pilot program in September 2014, enrolment has more than doubled and interest in our school continues to grow. As we enter our second year, we anticipate that our student body will once again grow exponentially when we open the forest to our first Kindergarten class. <br/><br/>

Parent InvolvementWe believe that parent involvement in preschool fosters a child’s sense of self-worth and security, and strengthens parenting skills. We value the importance of family and community in our children’s development. As the parents and teacher work together to build trust and confidence in the children, a strong future is gained for your child and our community at large.
Community InvolvementWe believe in the importance of family and active participation in the community. Monthly field trips, family days and activities that include siblings and participation in community events are a few of the ways that we make this part of our program a reality for our children.

WHY FOREST SCHOOL?We believe that today's children are spending less time outside and more time indoors engaged in technology-driven activities. 

We believe that as parents and educators, it is our responsibility to steer our children away from this ""nature-deficit-disorder"" (LOUV, 2005). Since launching our forest school pilot program in September 2014, enrolment has more than doubled and interest in our school continues to grow. As we enter our second year, we anticipate that our student body will once again grow exponentially when we open the forest to our first Kindergarten class.

HOW YOU CAN HELPFor the past 46 years, Langley Forest School (previously known as Happy Hours Parent Participation Preschool) has been run by a group of dedicated and passionate volunteer parents, with funding stemming almost entirely from the tireless efforts of our families. 

Our 3 part Indiegogo Campaign will help us raise 100% of our $100,000 goal. However, there is still so much more work to do before we reach our final goal allowing us to form a complete Preschool to Grade 7 outdoor school in our community. Campaign 1.0 will bring much needed funds to:

Build small shelters
Hire teachers and staff
Provide relevant teacher and staff training
Establish scholarships
Provide financial assistance to increase our accessibility to all students
Acquire additional resources to meet the demands of student growth


Your donations, from $1 to $25,000, will ensure that our goals are met. Donations of $100 or more will receive a charitable donation receipt for tax purposes.

YOUR FUNDING AT WORK





Marketing (brochures, advertising, promotional booths at Summer markets and festivals)


Teacher and assistant salaries


Administrative wages


Training and professional development


Outdoor rain suits for the children and backup inclement weather clothing


Equipment (tents, outdoor tools, stationery and wilderness First Aid kits)

Today at 74 years of age he is sending 20,000 books back to his home province of Mendoza to create an English Library completely out of recycled books he has gathered from his Catskill Mountain (Upstate New York) home. </p>
<p>By spending nearly his entire savings, and with the support from his relatives the books are now en route to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvear,_Corrientes"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Alvear_Department,_Mendoza"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alvear Argentina.</a> This campaign serves to help him gain capital to buy a property to establish an English Library/Art Center in Alvear Argentina.</p>

<p><b><i>Who put this together?</i></b></p>
<p>Hi,<a href=""www.ottoohle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a><a href=""http://www.ottoohle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Otto Ohle</a>. I am a student studying within the <a href=""https://newmedia.purchase.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Media</a> department at Purchase College.

<p>I am documenting this story, however all donations we receive will go towards making this library possible.</p>
<p>Martin really needs your help. In his words, <i><b>""This is a way to show the world a side of America they don't see in the media"".</b></i> Please help share this project and help influence new ways of creating harmony on earth. </p>
<p><b>The money you contribute completely towards making this Library possible</b>. I am prepared to help and document this story as it unfolds.</p> </div> <div> <h3>WHY WE NEED HELP -<i> </i>
</h3>
<h3><i>THIS PROJECT IS TOO BIG FOR ONE PERSON</i></h3> <p> By hand and by himself Martin loaded a truck  container with 20,000 books which is now on its way to Chile via boat, and then must be transported to Argentina via truck.</p>
<p>His plan now is to travel to Alvear and find a home for these books. He doesn't have much money to put a down payment on a property or rent a building. <b>We are asking for donations in exchange for his artworks and other interactive perks.</b></p>
<p><b>It is outrageous to have such a generous deed to humanity fall on one person. If we as humans work together to support Martin's effort, the story could inspire lives across the globe to make the world a better place.</b><br/></p>

<p></p>

</div></div>","ABOUT THIS PROJECT Artist Martin Munoz came to the United States 40 years ago without knowing a word of English. Today at 74 years of age he is sending 20,000 books back to his home province of Mendoza to create an English Library completely out of recycled books he has gathered from his Catskill Mountain (Upstate New York) home. 
By spending nearly his entire savings, and with the support from his relatives the books are now en route to Alvear Argentina. This campaign serves to help him gain capital to buy a property to establish an English Library/Art Center in Alvear Argentina.

Who put this together?
Hi,  Otto Ohle. I am a student studying within the New Media department at Purchase College. I have been documenting Martin's story as a NYC legend, outsider artist, and his perseverance and struggle to create this library in a documentary photography book and film titled, ""The Llama Man"". 
I am documenting this story, however all donations we receive will go towards making this library possible.
Martin really needs your help. In his words, ""This is a way to show the world a side of America they don't see in the media"". Please help share this project and help influence new ways of creating harmony on earth. 
The money you contribute completely towards making this Library possible. I am prepared to help and document this story as it unfolds.   WHY WE NEED HELP - 

THIS PROJECT IS TOO BIG FOR ONE PERSON  By hand and by himself Martin loaded a truck  container with 20,000 books which is now on its way to Chile via boat, and then must be transported to Argentina via truck.
His plan now is to travel to Alvear and find a home for these books. He doesn't have much money to put a down payment on a property or rent a building. We are asking for donations in exchange for his artworks and other interactive perks.
It is outrageous to have such a generous deed to humanity fall on one person. If we as humans work together to support Martin's effort, the story could inspire lives across the globe to make the world a better place.


WHAT WE WILL USE THE MONEY TOWARDS


$2,000 - Travel and living expenses to document this story as it unfolds.
$5,000-$8,000 - It is unclear how much it will be to have the books transported from the port in Chile to Alvear Argentina. We will need to rent a truck and hire a driver to do this job. 
$15,000  We are asking for startup money to find a home for these books. Funds will be used  towards putting a down payment on a property and buying a structure such as a yurt. 
    The Impact This is a creative and useful way to recycle books. As English is the second language to the world,  this library has the potential to expand possibilities for those in Argentina with access . Martin hopes to work with the community to create an exchange program and  have American students teach English and art classes in the library.
These books all are used books that Martin collected in New York State and City. Martin didn't know any English when he first came to NY, and claims that books are what taught him the language, and helped him become independent in the USA. 
*Together, we can all make a difference, Martin shouldn't have to do it alone.
This story of dedication and perseverance will also be documented in a multimedia book/documentary film entitled ""The Llama Man""
    Risks & Challenges If we don't raise this money, the journey will simply be a lot more difficult to establish a home for these books. 
We are prepared to travel to Argentina and speak to the mayor of Alvear, as well as the Director of Culture of Alvear, other Art Centers, and of course the local people to work with the community to establish and English Library with English and Art classes for the townspeople. 
Martin is also willing to sacrifice his apartment in the city of Mendoza in order to establish a building for the library in the city of Alvear.

<h3>The Bigger Picture<br/>
</h3> <p>Admittedly, we are living in a bit of a golden age for Irish music and dance between an abundance of young energetic musicians and groups from both sides of the Atlantic and the popularity of entertainment juggernauts such as Riverdance, Celtic Thunder, Celtic Women, LOTD and many more it has been a wonderful decade or so to be a fan of Irish music and dance.  Dance classes are full in many locations, curls bouncing and brightly colored dresses twirling, music classes are available in quite a few US metropolitan areas and we are producing world champions.  Everything seems to be going swimmingly so why the need? What's the urgency?</p>
<p>While there has indeed been been a resurgence since the mid 1980's focused on traditional Irish culture here in the US it has mainly been focused on music and step dance and has been centered around the traditional bastions of Irish immigration (Boston, NY, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, etc...).  Step away from the neighborhoods of Crum Lynne, Breezy Point, Pearl River, and Mount Greenwood and it can be difficult if not impossible to find opportunities for lessons and when you do they can be cost prohibitive in today's tight economics.  Also, even in those very Irish-American communities there is an abundance of competition for children's interest and attention.  The cultural traditions need to continually be made relevant for each generation incorporating the ""new and the now"" while remaining true to the spirit, form, traditions and expression of the past.  And it must be accessible and affordable to anyone who has an interest.</p>
<p>There is also so much more to our heritage than just music and dance.  <i>An Ghaeilge, </i>the Irish language, is one of the oldest European languages in existence, it should be taught and preserved here as well as in Ireland.  The sports of Hurling and Gaelic Football are two of the most exciting, energetic and under-appreciated sports in the world and deserving of both a wider audience and active participants!  Our poetry, literature and dramatic arts are some of the finest expressions of the human experience in all its glory, humor, and despair and should continue to be studied, performed and expanded upon by a new generation of voices.  The list goes on and on.<br/></p>

<h3><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Still Standing</i></strong>  - We are a Mozambican platform with interests in Sports, Culture and Publishing. </p>
<p>Focused on training the individual, we believe that a multi-disciplinary teaching is the way to achieve Sustainable Education.</p>
<p>Always in partnership with the Mozambican Committee of Mini-basketball we intend to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Inspire children and youngsters; </li>
<li>Shape conscious citizens;</li>
<li>Propagate knowledge and respect for Nature;</li>
<li>Promote a reading culture; </li>
<li>Through sports (basketball), pass values such as:</li>
</ul>
<ol style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>​Respect;</li>
<li>Character;</li>
<li>Friendship;</li>
<li>Team Work;</li>
<li>Positive Attitude;</li>
<li>Leadership;</li>
<li>Integrity and</li>
<li>Healthy Habits.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Promote respect for Cultural Identity; </li>
<li>Search an inclusive and equitable society.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We have the privilege to actively participate in an important phase of development of the Human Being, on their mental and physical abilities, and their preparation to take responsibilities, and we do it with pride to ensure that we will have built a better Society and a better World for tomorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How do We Operate? </strong></h3>
<p>Mozambique, being an underdeveloped country, cannot seclude itself from high rates of illiteracy.</p>
<p>The main factors for these high rates are children dropping out of school at very early stages to be introduced into the (informal) labour market and thus contribute for the family’s income; high population growth that creates a huge gap between the few existing teachers for a large number of students; poor education quality.</p>
<p>The current education is not restricted to scientific queries, technological and economic development. It is closely related to Values ​​and the way we observe and understand a world in constant change. </p>
<p>Basic education (1st / 7th grade - compulsory education) assumes capital importance because it may be the only time when children come into contact with the ""tools"" that will them live with the current reality.</p>
<p>Hence our focus on the age group from 6-12, by creating a mini-basketball nuclei in primary schools and neighbourhoods (mainly peripheral). </p>
<p>We have allied mini-basketball to the environmental conservation and preservation and diversified activities as a way to provide more stimulus to the children, provide them with minds full of dreams, colours, hope and positive energy. </p>
<p>In October 2015, we had the first activity within a conservation area - Niassa National Reserve - which we baptized as (in Ajaua dialect) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NDahwrfZ_o"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Kuzengwa Kwa Umi"" - (translated to) ""The Joy Of Life""</a>. It is an action model which we intend to implement in remote areas and / or difficult access, in particular in environmental conservation areas.</p>
<p>In Mozambican schools, particularly public, is very unusual to encounter the incorporation of playfulness, the use of libraries and other information tools. </p>
<p>Therefore, it is urgent to reframe the role of the School as the first training agent to create a Model Citizen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why do we need help? </strong></h3>
<p>Mozambique is going through an economic crisis and it tends to worsen. </p>
<p>The economic agents are retracted or closing down operations, and the difficult process of raising sponsorship for these activities has become even more complicated. </p>
<p>Despite all the adversity, we believe that this is the time that the mini-basketball movement should show all of its strength. </p>
<p>It has been 10 years with some achievements gained with great sacrifice. The movement cannot stop. </p>
<p>For the second half of this year (until August 2017) we intend, among many other activities, to extend the ""Joy Of Life"" to the Gorongosa National Park, the village of Mangundze, and consolidate the Niassa experience, where we left equipment for the children to continue practicing.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is to open four new centres with various integrated activities in 4 primary schools in Maputo - an experience that can be our base of action for the coming years. </p>
<p>It is a continuous journey and we know that we cannot continue alone, regardless of our commitment and dedication. </p>
<p>All of the raised funds will be used in the implementation of the activities mentioned below (logistics, staff, materials, etc.). </p>
<p>This is our Dream and our Passion. So we urge you for support, in whichever way possible. </p>

<p>Siku ni Siku - One day at a Time!!!</p>
</div></div>","Who Are We?
Still Standing  - We are a Mozambican platform with interests in Sports, Culture and Publishing. 
Focused on training the individual, we believe that a multi-disciplinary teaching is the way to achieve Sustainable Education.
Always in partnership with the Mozambican Committee of Mini-basketball we intend to: 

Inspire children and youngsters; 
Shape conscious citizens;
Propagate knowledge and respect for Nature;
Promote a reading culture; 
Through sports (basketball), pass values such as:


​Respect;
Character;
Friendship;
Team Work;
Positive Attitude;
Leadership;
Integrity and
Healthy Habits.


Promote respect for Cultural Identity; 
Search an inclusive and equitable society.

 
We have the privilege to actively participate in an important phase of development of the Human Being, on their mental and physical abilities, and their preparation to take responsibilities, and we do it with pride to ensure that we will have built a better Society and a better World for tomorrow.
 
How do We Operate? 
Mozambique, being an underdeveloped country, cannot seclude itself from high rates of illiteracy.
The main factors for these high rates are children dropping out of school at very early stages to be introduced into the (informal) labour market and thus contribute for the family’s income; high population growth that creates a huge gap between the few existing teachers for a large number of students; poor education quality.
The current education is not restricted to scientific queries, technological and economic development. It is closely related to Values ​​and the way we observe and understand a world in constant change. 
Basic education (1st / 7th grade - compulsory education) assumes capital importance because it may be the only time when children come into contact with the ""tools"" that will them live with the current reality.
Hence our focus on the age group from 6-12, by creating a mini-basketball nuclei in primary schools and neighbourhoods (mainly peripheral). 
We have allied mini-basketball to the environmental conservation and preservation and diversified activities as a way to provide more stimulus to the children, provide them with minds full of dreams, colours, hope and positive energy. 
In October 2015, we had the first activity within a conservation area - Niassa National Reserve - which we baptized as (in Ajaua dialect) ""Kuzengwa Kwa Umi"" - (translated to) ""The Joy Of Life"". It is an action model which we intend to implement in remote areas and / or difficult access, in particular in environmental conservation areas.
In Mozambican schools, particularly public, is very unusual to encounter the incorporation of playfulness, the use of libraries and other information tools. 
Therefore, it is urgent to reframe the role of the School as the first training agent to create a Model Citizen.
 
Why do we need help? 
Mozambique is going through an economic crisis and it tends to worsen. 
The economic agents are retracted or closing down operations, and the difficult process of raising sponsorship for these activities has become even more complicated. 
Despite all the adversity, we believe that this is the time that the mini-basketball movement should show all of its strength. 
It has been 10 years with some achievements gained with great sacrifice. The movement cannot stop. 
For the second half of this year (until August 2017) we intend, among many other activities, to extend the ""Joy Of Life"" to the Gorongosa National Park, the village of Mangundze, and consolidate the Niassa experience, where we left equipment for the children to continue practicing.
Our biggest challenge is to open four new centres with various integrated activities in 4 primary schools in Maputo - an experience that can be our base of action for the coming years. 
It is a continuous journey and we know that we cannot continue alone, regardless of our commitment and dedication. 
All of the raised funds will be used in the implementation of the activities mentioned below (logistics, staff, materials, etc.). 
This is our Dream and our Passion. So we urge you for support, in whichever way possible. 
Please do Share our campaign with friends.

</div><h4></h4><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Due to the pressures of the modern world, the cultural
traditions and practices of the Maasai are vanishing. The plight of the Maasai
has also amplified the necessity and urgency to document these precious
traditions. </span><br/></p>
<p>The Maasai are a pastoralist people whose
territory stretches on both sides
of the borders between Kenya and Tanzania. At present, the population
approximates 900.000 people. The Maasai represent one of
the most famous indigenous groups of East Africa. They live nomadically  and semi-nomadically with their herds
of cattle. They are well known for
their hospitality and democratic community which blends a spiritual dimension
and relationship with their environment. As other <i style=""font-weight: normal;"">primary people</i>, they are consciously aware and respectful of the
earth and cosmos and feel responsible for maintaining a balanced world. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Overall
and in spite of modern life's pressures, the Maasai
people have been able to  maintain this traditional pastoralist
approach, and (semi) nomadic cultural identity. However their community is
increasingly forced to situate in one location which is impacting their nomadic
way of living.  As a result, the children
are also attending schools where they are taught in Swahili and English and
Maasai parents no longer have the ability to teach the Maa language and
tradition.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">That is why documenting this vanishing knowledge is so important. The project is also meant to give to the world a more coherent image </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">of the Maasai values and  t</span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">o

<p>Background research for the Oreteti project took place
in Southern Kenya in August of 
2015. A four person team travelled during a whole month though the Maasai
land, from Kajiado to Oloitokitok en from Loita to Maasai Mara, meeting Maasai botanists and elders, gathering photos, taking notes and
conducting  interviews. To date,
this research has been made possible thanks to funding from the French
foundation <i>Fondation Denis Guichard</i>.</p>
<p>Now we need your help to continue our work. Your contributions will support further research, the
production, lay out and  printing
of  an encyclopedia in Maa and English. This encyclopedia will
overview approximately 100 edible, medicinal, veterinary and ceremonial Maasai plants
and trees which support the life of the Maasai people. About 250 color
illustrated pages will be made exclusively available as a result of this
project. We hope to publish it in the spring of 2017. We are very thankful for all contributions!</p><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458227220/kxmr7mj24ekw7vgd2j2i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>

Oreteti is a project which documents critically important Maasai oral traditions and historical botanical uses and customs. 
My name is Lucie Hubert. In 2012 I have met Kenny Matampash ole Meritey, one of the highest and most distinguished representatives of the Maasai people of Kenya. Kenny asked me to participate in a beautiful project: documenting and preserving the Maasai culture  and traditions. Since the Maasai use plants for purposes that touch every aspect of their life, Kenny decided to start his project documenting these plants. We named it Oreteti which is one of the most sacred trees of Maasai land.The uniqueness of this project is that it originates from the Maasai community itself. All Oreteti publication content and data will be dually published in both Maa and English language. An important goal of Oreteti is to preserve the Maasai legacy for future generations as well as providing a contemporary view of the Maasai civilization.  

Due to the pressures of the modern world, the cultural
traditions and practices of the Maasai are vanishing. The plight of the Maasai
has also amplified the necessity and urgency to document these precious
traditions. 
The Maasai are a pastoralist people whose
territory stretches on both sides
of the borders between Kenya and Tanzania. At present, the population
approximates 900.000 people. The Maasai represent one of
the most famous indigenous groups of East Africa. They live nomadically  and semi-nomadically with their herds
of cattle. They are well known for
their hospitality and democratic community which blends a spiritual dimension
and relationship with their environment. As other primary people, they are consciously aware and respectful of the
earth and cosmos and feel responsible for maintaining a balanced world. 
Overall
and in spite of modern life's pressures, the Maasai
people have been able to  maintain this traditional pastoralist
approach, and (semi) nomadic cultural identity. However their community is
increasingly forced to situate in one location which is impacting their nomadic
way of living.  As a result, the children
are also attending schools where they are taught in Swahili and English and
Maasai parents no longer have the ability to teach the Maa language and
tradition.That is why documenting this vanishing knowledge is so important. The project is also meant to give to the world a more coherent image of the Maasai values and  to
transmit  their vision about their relation to nature and cosmos,
and preservation of the natural resources.











Background research for the Oreteti project took place
in Southern Kenya in August of 
2015. A four person team travelled during a whole month though the Maasai
land, from Kajiado to Oloitokitok en from Loita to Maasai Mara, meeting Maasai botanists and elders, gathering photos, taking notes and
conducting  interviews. To date,
this research has been made possible thanks to funding from the French
foundation Fondation Denis Guichard.
Now we need your help to continue our work. Your contributions will support further research, the
production, lay out and  printing
of  an encyclopedia in Maa and English. This encyclopedia will
overview approximately 100 edible, medicinal, veterinary and ceremonial Maasai plants
and trees which support the life of the Maasai people. About 250 color
illustrated pages will be made exclusively available as a result of this
project. We hope to publish it in the spring of 2017. We are very thankful for all contributions!

The goal of our campaign is to help build a
state-of-the-art 3D simulation development lab in Maryland to enable kids who
are interested in programming and digital design to earn industry certifications
& provide scholarships towards interactive STEM-related
careers.
Your contribution will directly help support the funding
needed to fully-operate STEMBright year-round as well as provide necessary materials needed for hardware, software, licenses and professional certifications. This type of educational curriculum, set in a
fun and encouraging environment, is essential to cultivating creative and
innovative skill development in computer science.
With the help of our strategic partners and through the
generosity of individuals like you, STEMBright Studios is prepared to offer
annual internships to young professionals who want to learn how to become the
makers of tomorrow. STEMBright is unique, in that provides a tiered level of professionals who train our college interns. In return, our college interns mentor and teach our middle-high school students. This educational ecosystem allows for STEMBright to directly provide annual scholarships to college students while also providing senior capstone experiences for high school seniors in the form of apprenticeships. STEMBright summer camps and afterschool programs will provide
Maryland's youth the opportunity to directly learn STEM principles
from professionals and become proficient in applying
cutting-edge technologies in 3D modeling, programming, 3D printing, Virtual Reality,
user design, digital art, video game and simulation development.
Help us meet our goal by donating or sharing this
campaign. Together we can help support a cooperative career pathway for
generations of youth to develop into tomorrow's leaders in computer science,
art, and technology.

We are
     Professors, Teachers, College Students, and Industry Professionals
     who are passionate about educating our youth in developing simulations
     & video games. Our team includes programmers and designers who have
     worked in the US Military to AAA video game industry, as well as taught video game
     development inside the classroom. 
Our
     goal is to build STEMBright Studios, an interactive development lab in Sandy
     Spring, Maryland to provide innovative programs that foster the knowledge
     and professional skill development towards careers in simulation,
     business, visual design and digital entertainment.
STEMBright
     Studios provides afterschool programs in interactive development, certification
     training, we host Game Designer's Camp in the summer,
     provide monthly game developer meet-ups, host gallery and
     gaming showcase events, and run STEAM-based competitions.
Students
     will become proficient using professional design tools in Adobe CSS,
     Autodesk, Unity, Unreal, Z Brush and develop virtual reality
     simulations with Oculus Rift.
Our
     staff of certified trained instructors provide the opportunity for
     students to earn industry certifications in Adobe, Autodesk, Unity and many more. 


The Impact of your support
We believe every kid should have access to the tools of
innovation, like 3D printers and design software, regardless of income or
status. Everyone should have the opportunity to experiment, learn, and grow.
Your financial support of this campaign will help us make that a reality for generations for our youth in Maryland. 
Every young person who enters the
simulation development lab will take inspiration and creativity back
to their community and their peers. Programs like this are often kids' first
introduction to design and engineering concepts not regularly taught in school.
We hope to help inspire the next generation of great inventors,
artists, scientists, designers, engineers and makers. Thank you for supporting  such an amazing, unique opportunity to build a collaborative ecosystem here in Maryland.

<p>The Cognitive Initiative</p>
<p>The Cognitive Initiative is a volunteer tutoring program designed by The Benab Foundation, a social enterprise in Guyana. The program focuses on Math, English and critical thinking, working with disadvantaged students. Over its three years of operation it has helped over 250 students from ages 12 to 14. This summer we hope to expand to over 450.  </p>
<p>Every dollar donated gives another child the opportunity to attend the program! Donate today! If you can't you can still play a part by spreading the word about the Cognitive Initiative.</p>
<p>For more information on our program, visit our Facebook page by clicking here or please see a longer description of The Cognitive Initiative and it's history below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Cognitive Initiative</p>
<p><br/>English and Mathematics have consistently proved difficult subject areas for Guyana’s Secondary High Schools, with national pass rates hovering well below 50%. On the other hand, students from the historically most successful schools, such as Queen’s College or the Bishops High School, have had a much more positive experience. Is there any way to link these two groups of students so that this success can be shared?</p>
<p>The Cognitive Initiative does this as it is modeled after a successful Pratham initiative in India, where well-performing students taught their less-fortunate peers. This showed impressive gains in learning for students in the program while, being volunteer driven, costs remained low. Further, as our volunteers are drawn from high schools, we host this program during the summer, when they are free to help.</p>
<p>Our program also provides important implicit benefits as, according to the paper “Arresting the Summer Slide,” by Swarthmore College student Steve McFarlan, it could also address summer learning loss. This phenomenon, where low income students lose learning time over the summer because their higher income peers are comparatively engaged in more useful activities (like summer camps etc.), is responsible for much of the learning difference between both groups, and is relevant because many poorly performing schools in Guyana are populated with low income students. Our summer program thus also serves as a great way to fight this continued learning gap.</p>
<p>There have been three editions of the Cognitive Initiative, improving hundreds of students’ algebra and grammar skills. Our students show sharp improvements in their scores and high knowledge retention rates by the end of the program and as a result we will continue to build out and expand it with each passing year. The Cognitive Initiative is a simple, cost effective program that is making strides toward improving education in Guyana for all.</p>

<div>
<p>Joe followed his heart &amp; dreams and moved to New York where he went on to become a jack of all trades, finding success in fashion design, custom bike building, carpentry, and most notably fine art. A true optimist and visionary, Joe set his mind to something and did it. His positive attitude and mischievous demeanor remained even up to the very end of his life. Joe passed away March 20, 2014 after a 4 year battle with cancer. Joe made the most of his short time on earth.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Justin and I humbly ask for your help to further my yoga studies at Kula Yoga Teacher Training in New York.</p>
<p>I have practiced yoga for well over 10 years - when I first put on a yoga DVD at home and yoga'd along. I didn't really know what was going on, but I certainly enjoyed it! Eventually I managed to gather the courage to attend my first class! And I haven't looked back since!</p>
<p>In a particularly tumultuous time in life I leaned quite heavily on yoga to help navigate my way. One unique teacher saw my struggle and spoke with me about my intense desire to go deeper in my yoga practice and study. Subsequently, I found my way to Ashtanga Yoga -which has opened up my body, mind, spirit and most importantly, my heart - to the powers of yoga.</p>
<p>I have always had a passion for teaching. Through the years I have taught acting and performance - an opportunity to help people find truth and authenticity on stage. In yoga, we explore that same authenticity. By turning inward we examine the vast terrain of our inner selves and expose the good, the bad and the ugly - learning to work with whatever arises with compassion and grace. </p>
<p>In attending this particular training program, I will have the opportunity to study with master teachers - including Nikki Vilella and Alex Auder! Beyond asana (posture) we will receive a thorough training in alignment and adjustments, sanskrit and chanting, and the opportunity to develop our own creative yogic voice.

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","My Story
My name is Justin and I humbly ask for your help to further my yoga studies at Kula Yoga Teacher Training in New York.
I have practiced yoga for well over 10 years - when I first put on a yoga DVD at home and yoga'd along. I didn't really know what was going on, but I certainly enjoyed it! Eventually I managed to gather the courage to attend my first class! And I haven't looked back since!
In a particularly tumultuous time in life I leaned quite heavily on yoga to help navigate my way. One unique teacher saw my struggle and spoke with me about my intense desire to go deeper in my yoga practice and study. Subsequently, I found my way to Ashtanga Yoga -which has opened up my body, mind, spirit and most importantly, my heart - to the powers of yoga.
I have always had a passion for teaching. Through the years I have taught acting and performance - an opportunity to help people find truth and authenticity on stage. In yoga, we explore that same authenticity. By turning inward we examine the vast terrain of our inner selves and expose the good, the bad and the ugly - learning to work with whatever arises with compassion and grace. 
In attending this particular training program, I will have the opportunity to study with master teachers - including Nikki Vilella and Alex Auder! Beyond asana (posture) we will receive a thorough training in alignment and adjustments, sanskrit and chanting, and the opportunity to develop our own creative yogic voice. We will remove ourselves to the beautiful North Fork Yoga Shala on the north tip of Long Island New York to allow ourselves to focus on this important study. It is an intense training program that will go far in augmenting the knowledge I have already gained in my years of personal practice and study.
One big lesson I've learned through the years is that I can't do it all on my own. I bow to you and ask for your help in accomplishing my dream of becoming a certified Yoga Alliance teacher. Any donations received will go towards alleviating the cost of tuition and travel and help me to focus my time and attention on soaking up as much knowledge as I possibly can.

</div></div>","City Wild Camp: Explore the true nature of Philadelphia








City Wild is a unique summer camp experience for
curious kids aged 10–13 that offers off-the-beaten-path
adventures and behind-the-scenes excursions to explore
nature in urban Philadelphia.

Land Health Institute was founded in 2013 to explore the deep connection between the land and the communities that inhabit it. Our philosophy is grounded in the belief that healthy land is at the root of healthy communities. 

By providing urban children with the contact with nature
they so badly need, we want to help kids forge that
important bond and connect with nature for the rest of
their lives. 





What We Need: Scholarship Fund

We want to provide this experience for those who need it most: kids from the heart of Philadelphia who most lack this important contact with nature.

That's why we are looking to build a scholarship fund for spots in City Wild camp and change more lives with the beauty of nature. 

We need your help to provide one full-scholarship and two half-scholarships for each of the four camp sessions. 
Each two-week camp session costs $990 per camper, and for each additional $1000 that we raise beyond our goal, we can provide another camper with a spot.

Our Camp
After a successful two-week run last year, we are excited to offer City Wild through Miquon Day Camp this year to expand into a full 8 week program. Miquon Day Camp has a rich history providing amazing summer experiences to generations of kids. By joining forces we can leverage both of our organizations' love for nature and discovery create a truly unique and unparalleled experience.
During City Wild, kids will explore Philly’s hidden gems, learn about the astounding
natural systems at work within the
city and explore most of the eclectic mix of
neighborhoods that make up Philadelphia over four sessions: Session 1 - Art and Architecture: From Gritty to SublimeSession 2 - Growing Stuff in the City and BeyondSession 3 - Talking Trash: Our Garbage and WasteSession 4 - City Water: Creeks, Rivers and Pipes 
Spots are still available for your own children, so don't hesitate to contact us for more information!

<p>For the past 70 years, the topic of extraterrestrial intelligent beings and UFO's has been controversial, if not ridiculed.  Despite many sightings and events, government, military and media have made a strong attempt to discredit the idea of extraterrestrial ""aliens"".  And in the face of their apparent ""disbelief"" of the topic, the same military and governments have spent huge amounts of money secretly studying these ""ridiculous"" UFO's and aliens. Thanks to freedom of information, and the actions of many with first hand experience, thousands of documents, witness testimony and data have surfaced, making the ridicule posed on ufology by media and governments seem staged and forced, with a very secret intent.</p>
<p>To name a few reasons why this topic is important, and why it must be subjected to rigorous scientific study:</p>
<p>1) Countries are beginning to release highly classified documents proving their governments interest in aliens and UFO's.</p>
<p>2) Hundreds of highly credible witnesses have come forward with testimony that at least some UFO's are verifiable alien technology.  These witnesses</p>
<p>include a former Canadian Defense Minister, numerous astronauts, high ranking US military officials, pilots, ... Well, I could go on and on, but instead</p>
<p>I will provide a few links for those of you interested in learning more:</p>

<p>What our project aims to do, is to use a low orbit satellite, controlled by us individuals, to study potential objects that emit high energy radiation.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll get data readings and pictures of solar-flare caused auroras.  Maybe we'll capture images of some very interesting meteors.  And maybe we'll actually capture a verifiable craft.  All we can do is try, and by doing this our way, we can open-source the data to you, the individuals.</p>

</div>
</div><br/></div>","First, what our Sat is capable of:Electromagnetic Radiation: we have an electro-magnetometer, capable of detecting variations in electromagnetic radiation.Ionized radiation: we have a scintillation counter, that enables us to measure the various radiation in our satellites environment.  This is significant as it enables us to detect high energy particles, radiation, and other phenomenon.Cameras: we will use two cameras with parabolic lenses, giving us a clear 360 degree view around our satellite.Our instruments will allow us to scientifically verify visual anomalies with correlated radiation.  This adds to the burden of proof required for extra-ordinary claims.Our Team:Costs:
We have already raised $30,000 USD previously, and this has paid for the building of our CubeSat and our Launch.
Data will cost $3000+ / month, and we will be in orbit up to three months.  This is why we are raising funds.  Anything raised above our goal will go towards future launches, and this may turn into a yearly mission.We need another $8000 USD Minimum for the 3 month data costs of our CubeSat.Mission Objectives

Now, on disclosure:
For the past 70 years, the topic of extraterrestrial intelligent beings and UFO's has been controversial, if not ridiculed.  Despite many sightings and events, government, military and media have made a strong attempt to discredit the idea of extraterrestrial ""aliens"".  And in the face of their apparent ""disbelief"" of the topic, the same military and governments have spent huge amounts of money secretly studying these ""ridiculous"" UFO's and aliens. Thanks to freedom of information, and the actions of many with first hand experience, thousands of documents, witness testimony and data have surfaced, making the ridicule posed on ufology by media and governments seem staged and forced, with a very secret intent.
To name a few reasons why this topic is important, and why it must be subjected to rigorous scientific study:
1) Countries are beginning to release highly classified documents proving their governments interest in aliens and UFO's.
2) Hundreds of highly credible witnesses have come forward with testimony that at least some UFO's are verifiable alien technology.  These witnesses
include a former Canadian Defense Minister, numerous astronauts, high ranking US military officials, pilots, ... Well, I could go on and on, but instead

What our project aims to do, is to use a low orbit satellite, controlled by us individuals, to study potential objects that emit high energy radiation.
Maybe we'll get data readings and pictures of solar-flare caused auroras.  Maybe we'll capture images of some very interesting meteors.  And maybe we'll actually capture a verifiable craft.  All we can do is try, and by doing this our way, we can open-source the data to you, the individuals.

Implement a program that educates parents on the importance of proper stimulation in infants and toddlers.  A significant portion of a person's intellectual capacity is determined in his/hers first 36 months of life.
Fund a school store at elementary level that will assist students with learning business practices.  From making change, to ordering and managing inventory, marketing, and price determination, our goal is to help students merge real life experiences with basic math skills.
To provide a rewards program to acknowledge and encourage students to come to school, do the right things, make good choices, and provide examples of excellent behavior.  In the typical school environment, a significant portion of time and resources is often directed towards students of high academic and behavioral need.  We want to help recognize students for everything from good grades to proper behavior and attitude.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our focus is on women and LGBTQ+ youth.  We are a group of mostly queer- and female-identifying college students or recent alumni from around the country and located in the DC area. We have chosen to focus on a combination of Life Skill Education and Arts Education because we believe the formal is vital for building a safe and healthy lifestyle, and the latter has been shown to create a strong sense of community and support. This would take the form of 6-9 weeks of classes with customized curricula, culminating in a presentation of the works created and skills learned. Thus, we would shine a spotlight on the issues that matter to our clients, and then shift that spotlight to our clients themselves, providing a platform for them to make their voices heard.
 It is our vision to help build a world in which people of all genders, sexes, and orientations are provided with the opportunities they deserve to build safe, healthy lives and be a part of open and welcoming communities.  What We Need 
 
In this first fundraising campaign, we are looking for the funds we need to run our first programs. This money would go to paying for art supplies, transportation, and other programming expenses. As we are a fully volunteer-staffed organization, we are proud to say that ALL money donated goes directly towards funding our program.     The Impact  
People of marginalized genders, sexes, and orientations are at much higher risks for homelessness, poor education, and mental illness. 
Life Skill Education has been shown to help people create safer, healthier, and more secure lives. It can range from subjects such as financial literacy (which studies show increases income, credit scores, and savings) to sex education (which reduces rates of unwanted pregnancy, abortion, sexual assault, and STIs).
Meanwhile, Arts Education is considered vital by 93% of Americans and has been shown to not only increase a sense of safety and communities among participants, but also to increase graduation rates, school attendance, academic performance, and critical-thinking/problem-solving skills.
We believe that the combination of these two things can help people to not only survive but thrive in a world that can be dangerous and disadvantageous for women and LGBTQ+ youth.
In the coming months, we want to build and develop our program to create something valuable, fun, and helpful with and for our clients.     
Risks & Obstacles  Our team is new to running a nonprofit business. However, we have a variety of resources for great advice and help from qualified professionals, and we intend to move steadily forward, applying all we learn to making the organization better and better.  The Spotlight Project is a relatively untested idea. This makes our journey very exciting, but also contains the risk of the idea failing, in which case we would have to pivot our company's offerings.

My name is Coatlicue
Alvarez, but many of you know me simply as ""Co."" I am currently a
third-year at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Although, my  Filipino-American mother and Mexican father
gave me an unconventional upbringing they also taught me some of the most
important lessons about myself and the world around me. From the day I was
born, they knew they wanted to instill values of courage and strength. They
gave me the powerful name Coatlicue, which in Aztec mythology is the goddess of
Earth.
I was a shy and
quiet kid for the majority of my life. In high school, giving presentations
stressed me out and talking to new people made me nervous. When I went away to
college, I was the only person from my high school and this gave me the
opportunity to challenge myself. I participated more and eventually took on
leadership positions. I participated in UCSB's Kapatirang Pilipino and Pilipino
Cultural Night and took leadership positions my second and third year:

ljude edukovati o poslovanju preko interneta, freelance-u i drugim srodnim

What is union research? Just what it sounds like: labor unions (who represent everyone from graduate students to steam pipe fitters) often employ researchers to help support their campaigns. It's a great job for someone like me, and after five years of teaching I really want to continue doing work that provides a public service. Because I don't have a lot of experience doing research professionally (I've got a lot of unpaid experience from my days as an activist) this program is really essential to helping me get my foot in the door. And because I've been underemployed for the past nine months, I really need help with some of these costs.What's the money for?UPDATE: Flight has been covered!$500 for tuition (I've been given a scholarship, reducing my tuition by half)$216 for dorm housing on-campus (being close to campus is essential given the long hours of the program)$120 for food $150 for miscellaneous costs (airport transportation, checking bags, etc.) I'm seeking to raise $986, or as close as I can get to that amount.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

THE MISSION








THE MEANING

The SES Experience centers on the
economy of sports and how that economy functions from family units and
communities, to small towns and cities across America — and around the globe.
Through the dual lens of athletics and globalization, SES curriculum
illustrates the dynamic between media, science, technology, management, and
globalization, including entertainment, music, fashion, and politics. We have
partnered with educators at GCE Lab School Chicago, accredited school, to bring
our educational mission to life.
THE FIVE PILLARS

The ‘Five Pillars of the Sports
Economy’ is a unifying framework that we invented to organize the vast body of
knowledge and fields of expertise that exist in Sports, consisting of Five
Pillars which are: 


Sports Media - Arts,
     literature, sociology, peace studies, and fashion are fields closely
     related to sports. 

Sports Science -
     This pillar focuses on math, physics, chemistry, and biology studied
     through the lens of sports.

Sports Technology - Design, Computer Science and Engineering involved
     with Sports.

Sports Management - Leadership, Economics and Finance taught in a way
     which will be conducive towards any career, not just sports career.

Sports Athletics -
     The last pillar is the physical performance of sports in both a social and
     a competitive environment.


We are designing our School to blend a rigorous International
Baccalaureate Sports Exercise and Science Program with the Five Pillars to create smart, socially
responsible global citizens. The success of
this campaign will allow us to complete our online curriculum and make it universally
accessible for teachers, students, and all types of learners.   We want the SES approach to be BREAKING THE PAVEMENT a CENTURY from now.

The Farm Project


We would like to expand in the countryside, in the Siaya region (southwest part of Kenya, near Victoria Lake), by building a land farm that would bring resources to sustain Hope Academy School in Kibera.



This farm project is meant to be a way to create a self-sustaining and self-propagating ministry. Firstly, some facilities have to be built there. Next, the plant and animal products resulting from working the land can be directly used as food ingredients for the children and also indirectly as a selling commodity for paying school expenses and fees. When the project matures, a part of the production revenues will be reinvested in the farm to keep it going another cycle.

What We Need:

1.  PURCHASING LAND (5 hectares)          @ 10 000 € (10 700 USD)
2.  FENCING                                                         @ 500 € (535 USD)

Impact


The children are our primary target. They need food, clothing, books, classrooms, and most of all guidance to be able to find meaning and purpose in life. All these aspects are touched by capitalizing on the farm production.
The secondary impact is on the people in the Siaya area. They will know that foreign adults and youths are investing in the education and lives of Kenyan children. This will be an opportunity for the workers to spread the word of God. Also, the people there will have a model for working the land, and creating their own family farms.

Thank you very much for donating. If you are still interested, please use the link below to donate directly to Teach For Nepal. Thank you very much.</b></span></p><p><span><b><a href=""http://nepalrelief.teachfornepal.org/donate-3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://nepalrelief.teachfornepal.org/donate-3/</a><br/></b></span></p><p><span><b><br/></b></span></p><p><span><b>The context:</b></span></p><p>The 7.8 magnitude earthquake and its many aftershocks have already left 7000 people dead, 15000 injured, and half a million people homeless in Nepal.  3.5 million are in need of immediate food and drinking water, and 1.4 million of these will need help for the next three months, according to the UN, just a few weeks before monsoon season.</p><p>The destruction has been massive. Now we must prevent people dying from relatively minor injuries and the spread of disease. Similar events occurred in Haiti, killing over 200,000 people.</p><p>Nepal is in a similar situation; both are third world economies with very poor infrastructure. The difference being that the Nepal earthquake was about 16 times more powerful than Haiti, and the steep mountainous terrain of the Himalayas present a bigger challenge to relief efforts.</p><p>And if a village luckily survived the earthquake, the landslides and avalanches that followed have completed the job of destroying anything that was still standing. Weather is not helping either. Spring in Nepal is characterized by severe thunder and hailstorms and next comes the infamous Monsoon season with torrential downpours lasting for days at a time.</p><p>In this time of need the Nepalese people request your help. Please help save the lives we still can by giving to a local charity using it in areas where it is needed most.</p><br/><p><b>Why is food/shelter very important in the coming months?</b></p><p>The Nepalese monsoon season runs from June to August, during which time it rains continuously for days on a country with no irrigation or infrastructure to cope with the massive landslides that follow.  Half a million people have been made homeless by this earthquake, so they will need shelter that is sufficient; 2 sided tarpaulin tents will simply not be enough to keep them alive and free of disease. </p><br/><p><b>Why are smaller local organizations better at disbursing aid?</b></p><p>While large charitable organizations are good at flying aid to Kathmandu, they usually leave the actual distribution to someone else, normally the national government, which is known to be very inefficient in Nepal.

</div></div>","This campaign has ended. Thank you very much for donating. If you are still interested, please use the link below to donate directly to Teach For Nepal. Thank you very much.http://nepalrelief.teachfornepal.org/donate-3/The context:The 7.8 magnitude earthquake and its many aftershocks have already left 7000 people dead, 15000 injured, and half a million people homeless in Nepal.  3.5 million are in need of immediate food and drinking water, and 1.4 million of these will need help for the next three months, according to the UN, just a few weeks before monsoon season.The destruction has been massive. Now we must prevent people dying from relatively minor injuries and the spread of disease. Similar events occurred in Haiti, killing over 200,000 people.Nepal is in a similar situation; both are third world economies with very poor infrastructure. The difference being that the Nepal earthquake was about 16 times more powerful than Haiti, and the steep mountainous terrain of the Himalayas present a bigger challenge to relief efforts.And if a village luckily survived the earthquake, the landslides and avalanches that followed have completed the job of destroying anything that was still standing. Weather is not helping either. Spring in Nepal is characterized by severe thunder and hailstorms and next comes the infamous Monsoon season with torrential downpours lasting for days at a time.In this time of need the Nepalese people request your help. Please help save the lives we still can by giving to a local charity using it in areas where it is needed most.Why is food/shelter very important in the coming months?The Nepalese monsoon season runs from June to August, during which time it rains continuously for days on a country with no irrigation or infrastructure to cope with the massive landslides that follow.  Half a million people have been made homeless by this earthquake, so they will need shelter that is sufficient; 2 sided tarpaulin tents will simply not be enough to keep them alive and free of disease. Why are smaller local organizations better at disbursing aid?While large charitable organizations are good at flying aid to Kathmandu, they usually leave the actual distribution to someone else, normally the national government, which is known to be very inefficient in Nepal. Local organizations are much better at distributing the aid; they are well networked and familiar with the local terrain. Also, their overhead costs are much lower: salary levels in Nepal are low in general, there is virtually no relocation expense, and no so-called danger premium. Local organizations also have a long term interest to operate in and develop the local community even after the preliminary relief activity. Local charities are in need of fundingBut unfortunately, local charities receive less than 1% of the total pledged support and most of this funding never gets disbursed. They usually have to raise funds locally or through individuals living abroad. If these funds could go to trusted local organizations and directly support local people, the money would go much, much further.Why Teach for Nepal?Teach For Nepal is a trusted local organization that reaches 112 communities and villages in the Sindhupalchowk and Lalitpur districts.

$500 will pay for one round-trip ticket from Haiti to the U.S.
$500 will pay for one year of secondary school education for one of our Haitian girls.
$1000 will pay for one round-trip ticket from Brazil to the U.S.

THE CHANGE YOU WILL HELP SUPPORT
The girls that will participate in these exchanges are bright, motivated, and excited to become agents of change in their own communities.  These girls have been hand selected by their home organizations and Global Girl Project because they have demonstrated leadership skills and a desire to help others that are in need.  Each girl is already thinking about the community project that she wants to implement after the exchange, once she returns home.  Each girl will start a project that will then educate, empower, and motivate other young people in their communities.  And so the cycle will continue as each young person affected will pay it forward.  As well, the students of the local high school in Los Angeles will be greatly affected.  Each student will be exposed to a different culture, a different language and through that exposure, will become more open to and understanding of the differences and similarities throughout the world.
We at the Global Girl Project know that real and long lasting change for a community is most successful when it comes from within that community. 
WHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GO
In order to provide an exchange opportunity such as this to young women from disadvantaged backgrounds we must fund all aspects of this project.  The money you donate will go towards:
 1.  Purchase of round trip plane tickets
      Rio to LA - $1000 per ticket (2 tickets) = $2000
      Port au Prince to LA - $500 per ticket (2 tickets) = $1000
 2.  Purchase of Student visas
      U.S. Visas - $160 per visa (4 visas) = $640
 3.  Purchase of passports for the girls
       Brazilian Passports - $63 (2 passports) = $126
       Haitian Passports - $93 (2 passports) = $186
4.  Help pay for the fee of the Wilderness Adventure camp.  
5.  One year of tuition for Haitian Secondary School - $500 (2 girls) = $1000
6.  Clothing for girls while in LA - $200 (4 girls) = $800
7.  Travel Insurance - $150 (4 girls) = $600
8.  Monthly Stipend for Host Families/two months - $2400 (4 families) = $4800
9.  Weekly Allowance for Participants/Eight weeks - $480 (4 girls) = $1920
10. Entrance Fees to Outings (Museums, etc.) - $250 (4 girls) = $1000",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><a href=""http://www.adamadembele.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adama Dembele</a> is a 33rd generation musician from Ivory Coast, West Africa, who resides in Asheville, NC. On January 12, 2015, the Ivory Coast government demolished his home and many others in Abobo, Ivory Coast, a city of 1.5 million people. The reason given for this demolition was that the ground was eroding and unsafe, a fact that is common in this part of the country with very little infrastructure. But, thousands of people were pushed out of their homes with one week’s notice and given no temporary housing or shelter. Some were forced to leave at gunpoint by the Ivory Coast Army. Many families and children are now living on the streets. Government officials have told people that “they are on a list,” but haven’t said where or when they will rebuild their homes, or even if they will rebuild.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Dembele family residence, including the Djembeso Drum &amp; Dance Education Center, was a place for people of all ages to study drumming, dance, and learn about West African culture. Local Asheville, NC musicians have traveled to study there, including members of <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/zansamusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zansa </a>and <a href=""http://www.toubabkrewe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toubab Krewe</a>, as well as hundreds, if not thousands, of others from around the world. The Dembele household has been a link between Asheville and West Africa for over a decade. The residence had been in the Dembele family for more than 70 years. It was a haven for locals to get off the streets and learn the music and history of their people.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Members of Zansa and other supporters of Asheville’s West African community are speaking out against this human rights violation and raising funds to help the Dembele family continue to grow their musical legacy.

The fact that Adama is a 33rd generation musician means that his family has been passing on their musical heritage and culture for nearly 700 years. Their household, known as Djembeso, which translates to House of Djembe, has been a mecca for musicians throughout West Africa, Europe, the United States, and beyond who have traveled there to study music.

The funds from this campaign will be used solely to provide scholarships to under-privileged students to assist with travel, lodging, and activity costs so that these teens may have the chance to follow their dream of becoming a marine biologist.
Motivating young minds
to be aware of marine conservation issues is an investment in our community’s
environmental future. Help a dream come true and give today.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name is Ursula Brown, and I have created this campaign in order to raise money so that I may be able to travel to New Zealand and earn a qualification as a ski instructor. I am 16 years old and currently undertaking my final year of secondary schooling, and in preparation for my upcoming graduation (26 weeks to go!)

<p>My mum works day and night to give me emotional and financial support in all of my academic and professional endeavours (I am also a qualified Zumba instructor), however without your contribution we will have insufficient funds for me to embark on this adventure.

<div>Although exciting and extremely fun, there are a few risks involved in this trip:</div> <ul>

<p>Sadly, on the evening of April 5<sup>th</sup> 2015,
our Garifuna Temple was set afire and burned to the ground leaving nothing but
ashes. No one knows how it happened, why it happened, or who could do something like this to a sacred structure. This tragedy affects not only our small community but the entire
Garifuna nation.</p>
<p>The Dabuyaba, our temple, is the strongest
manifestation of Garifuna spirituality in our community. It is where we gather
as family, receive spiritual guidance, hold important meetings, and celebrate
life with the Ancestors in sacred ceremonies. Reverence for our Ancestors and
respect for elders are central to holding the Garifuna community together. Our
strong spiritual connection with past generations is symbolized by the
spiritual ceremonies of the chugú and dügü – among others – which are essential
for our continuity and must take place in the Dabuyaba.</p>
<p>These ceremonies include days of healing and intense
sharing with family, extended families, and the Ancestors in the spiritual
world. We have one such ceremony, a dügü, scheduled less than four months away
for the first week of August later this year. Launching this fundraising
campaign, however, symbolizes the revival of our hope and we humbly ask your
help. Your financial contribution will provide the funds we need to rebuild our
Ancestral Temple, and have the sacred building completed in time for the August

</div></div>","Albert Einstein once quoted that 
""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""  
It allows individual growth through self discovery and mastery essential for peak performance while aiding society as a whole in maintaining order and balance in the world. Nowhere is imagination appreciated more than the arts and entertainment industries.
Youth in the Arts-IMAGINE (YITA-IMAGINE) a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Corporation and founded in April 2010 by Sheba Brown is based on the belief that attention to our youth needs to be of the utmost importance and we are committed to meeting those needs through the introduction and development of art education.



Our Story   

I'm SHEBA BROWN the
Founder, President, Executive Director & Program Manager for YITA-IMAGINE.  I'm also the owner of Sheba Productions, Aunnyx Cosmetics and Sheba's Collections.  



I've been professionally working in the fashion, beauty and entertainment industry for over 45 years. I began teaching in the mid 70's in the District of Columbia, New York, Maryland and Virginia with Academie Rachelle Modeling School; the Dept. of Parks and Recreation; Diva Dynasty Performing Arts; Dept. of Employment Services (D.O.E.S.), Sheba Productions; DC Public Schools and other organizations continuously throughout my life.  I offered various arts training to youth including lessons about the dance; modeling; performing arts; beauty industry including hair, makeup & wardrobe (styling, products and tools) for the industry and the various professions associated with those industries such as: importance of interviewing & auditioning, proper management, contracting and negotiation.
In the fall of 2010 I organized a team of professional, talented and celebrity artists.  We began providing introduction and training in all areas of the arts with the first series of Youth In the Arts Day ""IMAGINE"" One Day Boot Camps. 


The camps were hosted for registered participants, students and art professionals at the 4-H Conference Center, The National Center for Children and Families (homeless children and their parents, impoverished families, survivors of domestic violence, and abused and neglected children and adolescents who have been removed from their families) and also, at BDIGI Studios in Wash., DC hosted by iCue Music Group formerly, known as 855 MUSIC GROUP.  
With limited resources available in schools today for arts programming and curriculum, YITA-IMAGINE combines the elements of personal growth and self-development, with artistic expression as a way to build self-esteem, spirit and self-confidence among youth as well as adults by demonstrating all of the positive qualities viewed in the various arts.  The goal is to positively transform youth while providing an excitingly needed platform for showcasing and nurturing young talent.  Throughout the years youth and adults attend YITA-IMAGINE workshops to hone skills and learn new artistic disciplines from professionals in their areas of expertise such as theater, dance, fashion, music, film and stage production. 
    
THEATRE * STAGE * VOCALS * DANCE
  

Please Help Us Achieve Our Goal and keep the smiles on these young faces!!!!


  The Impact
While our current public school system offers fewer choices for our youth to explore their creativity in a regular classroom setting, there is a growing interest in the arts heightened by an explosion of popular media programming with great emphasis on creative endeavors. 

YITA has served approximately 300 youth and over 50 adults
Quality of production of a culminating performance managed and produced by the youth and staff
 Our successful track record has already made an impact on returning youth, school officials, government agencies, organizations and parents. 
Youth demonstrated remarkable improvement in their attitudes, freedom of creative expression, etiquette and classroom attentiveness. Their enthusiasm and performance skills have grown from the time they've entered until the time they've exited as witnessed by evaluations.

<p>We believe that every child should experience the world beyond the classroom as an essential part of learning and personal development and that is why we are making this one of our Key Priorities at Botley C of E Primary School in Hampshire. </p>
<p>The school is a small village school with just over 300 pupils ranging in age from 4 to 12 (school years Reception to Y6). We work together as a school community to ensure success for all our children and that they are fully equipped with the skills they will need to function effectively in the fast changing society in which they will find themselves, enabling them to live a fulfilled and enjoyable adult life.</p>
<p>This crowd funding campaign has been launched by the Friends of Botley School, the PTA (Parent Teacher Association) at the school. As a registered charity, all of our fundraising efforts are pumped straight back in to providing the children with educational resources and activities. There are so many items no longer covered by government budgets for schools that we, as the PTA, donate huge amounts to the school every year to fund school trips, library books, SEN resources, IT, sports equipment and art resources to name a mere few.</p>
<p>The school really feel that by enhancing and improving our outdated outdoor education areas, we can offer our pupils the chance to study outside and bring with it the whole host of excitement and learning that comes with this opportunity. </p>
<p><strong>The plan is this... </strong>to have installed in the school grounds a 6m round Finman Outdoor Classroom with electric supply, along with improvements to the existing sensory garden, access pathways, and the potential to include some school 'allotments' and growing spaces. </p>
<p><strong>Recent studies have highlighted some benefits of outdoor learning for young children:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>higher levels of conversational language.</li>
<li>greater independence.</li>
<li>improved health and sleeping patterns.</li>
<li>greater physical competence and agility.</li>
<li>improved time focus on activities and more concentration.</li>
<li>a greater understanding of nature and the environment.</li>
<li>improved social skills, involvement and initiative.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<div><em> The outdoor environment has massive potential for providing learning opportunities. We are extremely fortunate to be set in large grounds which could be used to enhance our educational provision. We don't want to offer this as a short term thing- we want to invest in a  lasting environment for future pupils too.</em></div>
<div>However, this comes at an estimated cost of £15,000 and by funding this large amount (nearly what we would raise in a whole year!) would take away from other items much needed by the school. We as the PTA have agreed to fund this on principal but do not want this to be at the detriment of the pupils when the end result would be such a benefit.</div>
<p>We are therefore turning to the crowd funding community to appeal to those who would like to donate towards the cost of the construction to benefit a fantastic and successful  semi-rural school, in order to improve education for the pupils. </p>
<p>You will note that we have only put a portion of the amount required as our goal as we don't want to be greedy!

<p><span>Tibetan Village Project scholarship program supports Tibetan college students through one-on-one sponsorship. Yarkyi, a summer camp to be held in Tibet this summer, is an opportunity for these students and their sponsors who wish to travel to Tibet to engage in a meaningful educational and cultural learning experience. In July 2015, seven sponsors from the United States will be traveling to Tibet for two weeks on a Conscious Journeys trip. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">TVP’s scholarship program currently supports 86 Tibetan students through one-on-one sponsorship. Given the dire need and priority to increase access to education for Tibetan youth living on the plateau, TVP’s goal is to increase our sponsored scholarships to 100 over the next three years. </span></p>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><span>We need to raise $5,000 by July 1st to cover students travel costs between their schools and the campsite in Kham, as well as food, lodging and program materials and supplies. Sponsors who are traveling to Tibet cover their own travel expenses, support students with their annual tuition and contribute to the summer camp as much as they can.

</div></div>","Goal: raise $5000 to organize a summer Camp for Tibetan college students in Tibet


“I want to see Tibetans become entrepreneurs, doctors, dentists, teachers, lawyers and be viable competitors in this rapidly changing economic landscape.”                                                        - Tamdin Wangdu, founder of Tibetan Village Project   
Tibetan Village Project scholarship program supports Tibetan college students through one-on-one sponsorship. Yarkyi, a summer camp to be held in Tibet this summer, is an opportunity for these students and their sponsors who wish to travel to Tibet to engage in a meaningful educational and cultural learning experience. In July 2015, seven sponsors from the United States will be traveling to Tibet for two weeks on a Conscious Journeys trip. TVP’s scholarship program currently supports 86 Tibetan students through one-on-one sponsorship. Given the dire need and priority to increase access to education for Tibetan youth living on the plateau, TVP’s goal is to increase our sponsored scholarships to 100 over the next three years. 
What We Need 


We need to raise $5,000 by July 1st to cover students travel costs between their schools and the campsite in Kham, as well as food, lodging and program materials and supplies. Sponsors who are traveling to Tibet cover their own travel expenses, support students with their annual tuition and contribute to the summer camp as much as they can. If we exceed our fundraising goal, funds will be used to cover students medical needs and other out-of-pocket costs that may prevent students from completing their education. 
What You Get

<p>The universe is
full of colors. When we are fortunate enough to appreciate them, we can see
more than 30,000 colors. And we cannot only see them, as we are also guided by
them. They help us communicate and understand the world around us.</p>
<p>Still, we all
know someone that suffers from some kind of visual impairment that prevents him
to make a partial or total apprehension of color. Even if we don't, it's not
hard to imagine how it feels. </p>
<p>Visually impaired people are not only blind people, but also color blind, partially sighted, with cataracts, glaucoma, or low vision. People who deal with obstacles everyday.</p>
<p>Actually, it's
pretty easy to think about the number of simple daily tasks we perform that
require visual sense and color recognition.</p>
<p>Choosing an
outfit, going to school, driving, working, using public transportation, taking
pills or eating. Basically, living.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As kids, we
learn to play with colored cubes, to paint blue skies and white clouds and to
eat all those green vegetables. </p>
<p><b>So, if you are
not able to see colors, how do you do all these basic things?</b> </p>
<p>One of two: you
avoid them, or you are always dependent of someone. Both are frustrating and
demotivating.</p>
<p>Unless you find
a way to exploit what you have. Under normal circumstances, when you are
visually impaired you still can hear, taste, smell and FEEL. </p>
<p><b>We believe that
color is for everyone, that's why we created a change-making code that empowers
the visually impaired to be able to identify colors through the combination of
colors and shapes, which they can FEEL thanks to a relief in the shapes.</b></p>
<p>It's about
inclusion, changing society and bringing quality of life to those who just see the world in a different way. </p>
<p>Using it, we
believe we can improve the visually impaired daily tasks, stop discrimination
and <b>change the paradigm</b>.</p>

</div></div>","The universe is
full of colors. When we are fortunate enough to appreciate them, we can see
more than 30,000 colors. And we cannot only see them, as we are also guided by
them. They help us communicate and understand the world around us.
Still, we all
know someone that suffers from some kind of visual impairment that prevents him
to make a partial or total apprehension of color. Even if we don't, it's not
hard to imagine how it feels. 
Visually impaired people are not only blind people, but also color blind, partially sighted, with cataracts, glaucoma, or low vision. People who deal with obstacles everyday.
Actually, it's
pretty easy to think about the number of simple daily tasks we perform that
require visual sense and color recognition.
Choosing an
outfit, going to school, driving, working, using public transportation, taking
pills or eating. Basically, living.

As kids, we
learn to play with colored cubes, to paint blue skies and white clouds and to
eat all those green vegetables. 
So, if you are
not able to see colors, how do you do all these basic things? 
One of two: you
avoid them, or you are always dependent of someone. Both are frustrating and
demotivating.
Unless you find
a way to exploit what you have. Under normal circumstances, when you are
visually impaired you still can hear, taste, smell and FEEL. 
We believe that
color is for everyone, that's why we created a change-making code that empowers
the visually impaired to be able to identify colors through the combination of
colors and shapes, which they can FEEL thanks to a relief in the shapes.
It's about
inclusion, changing society and bringing quality of life to those who just see the world in a different way. 
Using it, we
believe we can improve the visually impaired daily tasks, stop discrimination
and change the paradigm.




Feelipa Color Code
is a universal and inclusive code that associates colors to globally recognized
geometric shapes that are applied in relief to several surfaces and contexts, so
it can be FELT, when cannot be SEEN. This way, it is approachable to ALL the visually
impaired.
It's logical. We use the
square for red, the triangle for yellow and the circle for blue. 





Black, white
and grey are represented by horizontal lines.


  
Taking
this as the basis, we combine shapes and lines to get other colors and the tints
and shades.


Pretty easy, right? 
For now, there
are 24 different colors but we are thinking about developing a few more.Worldwide,
there are 285 million visually impaired. 39 million are totally blind. The
other 246 million people suffer from visual disorders as color blindness, amblyopia,
glaucoma, cataracts or low vision. 
80% of the
cases of visual impairment can be prevented or cured. We are here to improve
the lives of the remaining 20%.


Feelipa Color
Code than can be applied in all areas.
Stationery, technology, clothing, labels, furniture,
medicine, software, signage, transports, books, toys, food industry, maps or
inks. 






It's a whole
new language. That EVERYONE is able to understand.





We already
tested Feelipa Color Code with an incredible group of visually impaired children
that proved the code is easy to get used to. 
It allows them
to know colors as they play and learn and enables them to paint blue skies, red
apples and yellow shiny suns. Like all children should be able to do.
Since it is a
logical code that uses global concepts, we are sure that, regardless of the
age, people get quickly comfortable with the way colors and shapes get together
to create a universal new language.








We are an ambitious, enthusiastic
and determined team that believes that design is a way to enhance people’s
abilities and bring them together. 
Filipa Nogueira Pires created the
code in 2011 as a result of her research to make color accessible to all
people, particularly to those who have some kind of impairment. 
The investigation was carried in
partnership with the Helen Keller Center (an integration school for students
with visual impairment) where the code was tested with a group of children that
helped adjust and validate it.
We
are now looking to improve the code, not only spreading it around the world so
it can reach everyone, but also looking for new applications, games and ways to
generate more colors and utilities.



Our code is now
a reality that can improve millions of lives all over the world. But for
everyone to get it, we need everybody to share it.
We are
responsible for each other. With your help spreading Feelipa Color Code, we
believe that we can substantially improve the lives of visually impaired
people, making them more independent and self-reliant.
It is up to YOU
to make a difference. We dare to believe that if we all share Feelipa Color
Code, we will make a change in society. 




Feelipa Color
Code is totally FREE to the end user. 






First of all, your sharing is even more important than your money. Our main goal is to spread Feelipa Color Code worldwide, so it can reach as many people as possible. First, we want to implement it on schools, so all visually impaired children can have access to colors, as all the other kids do.
Your contribution will help us develop a teaching methodology for the implementation of Feelipa, not only in the programmatic contents but also in the everyday school life.
The development of the methodology will be carried out in partnership with an educational institution in Lisbon, Portugal — our home town. It will rely on the guidance of educators, teachers, special education assistants and psychologists.
We are aware that the correct implementation of Feelipa and a more enhanced methodology will require learning materials to support it. These materials will be designed as a result of the development of the methodology.
With only $150 you can be one of our Education Ambassadors and help Feelipa Color Code reach a school of your choice. And with only 1 share you are helping someone that is not fortunate enough to see colors as they really are.




We
have lots of great perks for our supporters but we believe the biggest reward
is to be part of a long-term plan to improve millions of lives all around the
world.

<div>Friday 7th was a long, but this time, satisfying day. Through CMG (Christian Mission to Gaza) Pastor Hanna raises money to buy food to take to those most in need.

</tbody></table> The food parcels, worth about £50, are very well received. People who know of families in the worst conditions contact Gaza Baptist Church and they try to help if they can. The families are contacted first to ask if they would like a food parcel. They all say 'yes'. The operation is run by a wonderful man called Atif. He is a Muslim and a good friend of Hanna's. He is a dear, warm human being. I liked him instantly. He was a close friend of Rami, who was martyred for his faith. Hanna calls him 'A man of peace'. So together with a Muslim driver, Hanna and I went with Atif to deliver parcels to 10 families. If you believe the stereotypes of Muslims in the media such an entourage should be impossible in a place like Gaza. But it isn't, because there are people of peace in both Christianity and Islam. And Hanna is happy to work with anyone who wants the best for his people.<br/><br/>The homes we visited were both tragic and wonderful. Every home showed some signs of severe deprivation: leaking roofs (corrugated sheets), rat infestation, broken-down cookers and washing machines, no hot water, little in the way of furnishings. Yet the spirit of the people was unbroken. These are strong, resilient people. Proud people. And there was the children. Thousands of them! About 8 plus in most homes. And they were just terrific. Like children everywhere they play and laugh and want your attention - attention I was happy to give them. I kept getting the blame for us running late because I was playing with the children! </div>

   What We Need & What You Get 
We have a short campaign, as we want to get funds and put them into action during the Easter season.  Our campaign will end on April 26, 2015, the Fourth Sunday of Easter. 

There are two Christian churches in Gaza.  They struggle to help all the poor in their communities, no matter what race, religion or beliefs they hold. - This was the example given to us by Jesus.  
 We will make contact with the two churches and offer to give a donation of 50% of the total Campaign receipts to each one.   
In the unlikely event that we cannot make contact with the two specific churches, we will give all of the money to recognized community organizers with a proven track record, including photo evidence, of working with and providing for the poorest in the community.

Our goal is to raise $12,000.  With Indigogo fees, and the cost of PERKS and money transfers,  we will have at least $11,000 to share between the two Christian churches of Gaza - IF we meet our GOAL.


 The Latin Catholic Church / Holy Family School, and,  the Church of Saint Porphyrius, an Orthodox Christian church.  - $5500 to each.




WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?

In the time of Jesus, there was political turmoil and conflicts in the land, just as there is today.  Jesus message was to help the poor and the needy, the oppressed, the suffering and the sick.  
Jesus did not align himself with the big power brokers of any affiliation; he cared about the poor, the needy, the sick and the oppressed; the people with no power and no voice.

<p>True Learning Cooperative will use guided discovery to deliver a self-paced literature and arts-based curriculum for students in grades K-12.  We will use proven innovative educational methods that work efficiently, and respond to individual needs and differences.<br/></p>
<p>We believe that schools should serve their families, that children should have choices in how they invest their time and be engaged in their learning. </p>
<p>All children want to feel accepted, want to feel safe, want to believe their ideas are valued and be treated as individuals with rights. </p>
<p>Educators should foster mutual trust and positive interactions between students and adults, and seek cooperation from students rather than relying on punitive or fear-based control measures.</p>
<p>Educators should create supportive, self paced, goal-oriented, and challenging learning environments that are flexible in meeting individual needs. </p>
<p>Schools should cultivate resiliency, effective communication, conflict resolution, and identifying and managing emotions.</p>
<p>Schools should encourage healthy diet and exercise, on campus and in the community. TLC will offer and encourage participation in yoga as a means of empowering children to teach themselves and enjoy what they are learning. Yoga also creates natural bonds among students, children, parents and the community at large. Students become teachers, teachers become students and the community joins in the process.</p>
<h4>Guided Discovery Fosters True Learning</h4>
<ul>
<li>Creates a cooperative social learning structure.</li>
<li>Offers the freedom to be creative, innovative and to engage critical thinking.</li>
<li>Initiates challenging investigations.</li>
<li>Facilitates discussions.</li>
<li>Engages students through performance and creative arts.</li>
<li>Allows intensive engagement and learning by reflection.</li>
<li>Encourages students to analyze, interpret, and predict.</li>
<li>Encourages independence, cooperation and productivity.</li>
<li>Encourages students to work at their own pace to accomplish goals.</li>
<li>Boosts intrinsic motivation, essential for true learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to make sure our students get enough physical activity, sleep, dinners with their family, time for friends, explore side interests and enjoy reading for pleasure. We want to encourage children to learn how to maintain some balance in their lives and enjoy a rich and wonderful childhood.</p>
<h4>How We Will Serve Our Families:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We feel homework is anti-family, and ours will consist mostly of reading.</li>
<li>TLC will NOT be subject to state and district required testing, and many other dictates.</li>
<li>TLC will NOT ""teach to the tests"" or be driven by Common Core Standards alone.</li>
<li>Our tiered instruction will allow students to be challenged at their own levels and paces.</li>
<li>Students will pursue art, music, dance, creative writing and drama, as well as traditional subjects.</li>
<li>Our plan will accommodate both gifted and challenged.</li>
<li>We will enjoy a flexible daily schedule. </li>
<li>We will offer flexible vacation options so that families can enjoy time off together. </li>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>How Will TLC Provide a Different Experience?</h4>
<p>TLC will provide a positive learning environment in which children can define who they are and who they want to be.</p>
<p>TLC will work to achieve mutual trust between students and adults.  Student behaviors are affected by the behaviors of the adults around them. </p>
<p>We will seek cooperation from students, rather than relying on control measures. We will affect behavior by addressing student motivations and our own behaviors.</p>
<p>Our education plan will reduce the motivation to cheat. Methods other than rewards and punishments will be utilized as punishment does not motivate improved behavior. </p>
<p>Students will play an active and thoughtful role in shaping our rules of behavior. Children deserve representation and the right to participate in decisions affecting them.</p>
<p>We will work with students on a human level that stimulates intellectual, artistic, and technical originality.  Students will treat others as they want to be treated and will develop appropriate strategies to use when interacting with others.</p>
<p>Children need practice making choices.  Actions have consequences.  Students will be responsible for their behaviors and will reflect on the effects their actions have on others.</p>
<p>The secret to success is the ability to make the right choices.  Listing pros and cons, identifying and evaluating options, and weighing facts carefully are methods that will be introduced and modeled.</p>
<h4>We Will Stand Firm on Tolerance.</h4>
<p>Bullying will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>We will work to increase the self esteem of all students, which will soothe the unheard needs of those who bully.  We will require all students to understand and sign a contract specifying that bullying behavior will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>We believe that by offering a way to bring bullying behavior to a public venue through our People's Court, its power will be lessened.  We will not tolerate berating, will work with students to understand why they have a need to insult and then help them to learn productive behaviors. </p>

<h4>Students Who Learn Differently</h4>
<p>Students with learning challenges will have unique opportunities to focus on who they are and how they learn. We will ensure that all students, especially those with learning challenges, focus on their abilities. </p>
<p>TLC will welcome families who seek alternatives to relying on medications and those who want to work towards discontinuing medication for their child(ren). TLC will provide support, a conducive environment and dietary choices appropriate for children with learning challenges.</p>

<h4>We need funds to make True Learning Cooperative a reality for area families, to show that our plan is a feasible business model that can be replicated and to spawn a revolution in education reform!</h4>
<p>We have our progressive literature and arts based education plan. We have developed plans to convert three office suites into our campus, and continue to evaluate other possibilities in our area. We want our campus to be large enough to to serve 282 students.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>True Learning Cooperative will also be funded by tuition and state scholarships. These funds will pay for teachers' salaries and administration.</b></span><br/></p>
<p>We will also earn revenue by offering yoga classes and healthy beverages and snacks during non-school hours and summer camps to meet the needs and interests of our area's older students.</p>
<h4>Yes, TLC is a For-Profit Venture.  </h4>
<p>We believe that an investor-based for-profit school can succeed and be more innovative than a non-profit school.  We will charge the amount the state pays for scholarships for tuition, and many of our students will be on scholarships. We will supplement tuition with yoga classes, workshops on health and nutrition, and our sales of juices and smoothies. </p>
<p>We are focused on efficiency and logic. As we grow and prosper, so will our educational programming, and the benefits we can provide to the community and its families.</p>
<p><b>JOIN US!  With YOUR SUPPORT, WE will prove our education model raises achievement, and accomplishes our every goal.</b> True Learning Cooperative will illustrate how to create a successful school that serves its students and its families, <i>Today, Tomorrow and Beyond. </i></p>
<h4>THIS IS NOT AN ENTIRELY NEW IDEA! </h4>
<h4>Progressive private schools are changing the educational landscape by advancing the ideas that students should play an active role in shaping their own futures, should have voices and choices, and utilize self-governing.</h4>

</div>","Education can and should prepare our children for the opportunities and challenges of the future. Our children can and should become lifelong readers and have a thirst for learning. 
True Learning Cooperative will use Inquiry-based learning and Mindfulness techniques to activate curiosity and willingness to learn.



True Learning Cooperative will use guided discovery to deliver a self-paced literature and arts-based curriculum for students in grades K-12.  We will use proven innovative educational methods that work efficiently, and respond to individual needs and differences.
We believe that schools should serve their families, that children should have choices in how they invest their time and be engaged in their learning. 
All children want to feel accepted, want to feel safe, want to believe their ideas are valued and be treated as individuals with rights. 
Educators should foster mutual trust and positive interactions between students and adults, and seek cooperation from students rather than relying on punitive or fear-based control measures.
Educators should create supportive, self paced, goal-oriented, and challenging learning environments that are flexible in meeting individual needs. 
Schools should cultivate resiliency, effective communication, conflict resolution, and identifying and managing emotions.
Schools should encourage healthy diet and exercise, on campus and in the community. TLC will offer and encourage participation in yoga as a means of empowering children to teach themselves and enjoy what they are learning. Yoga also creates natural bonds among students, children, parents and the community at large. Students become teachers, teachers become students and the community joins in the process.
Guided Discovery Fosters True Learning

Creates a cooperative social learning structure.
Offers the freedom to be creative, innovative and to engage critical thinking.
Initiates challenging investigations.
Facilitates discussions.
Engages students through performance and creative arts.
Allows intensive engagement and learning by reflection.
Encourages students to analyze, interpret, and predict.
Encourages independence, cooperation and productivity.
Encourages students to work at their own pace to accomplish goals.
Boosts intrinsic motivation, essential for true learning.




We want to make sure our students get enough physical activity, sleep, dinners with their family, time for friends, explore side interests and enjoy reading for pleasure. We want to encourage children to learn how to maintain some balance in their lives and enjoy a rich and wonderful childhood.
How We Will Serve Our Families:

We feel homework is anti-family, and ours will consist mostly of reading.
TLC will NOT be subject to state and district required testing, and many other dictates.
TLC will NOT ""teach to the tests"" or be driven by Common Core Standards alone.
Our tiered instruction will allow students to be challenged at their own levels and paces.
Students will pursue art, music, dance, creative writing and drama, as well as traditional subjects.
Our plan will accommodate both gifted and challenged.
We will enjoy a flexible daily schedule. 
We will offer flexible vacation options so that families can enjoy time off together. 






How Will TLC Provide a Different Experience?
TLC will provide a positive learning environment in which children can define who they are and who they want to be.
TLC will work to achieve mutual trust between students and adults.  Student behaviors are affected by the behaviors of the adults around them. 
We will seek cooperation from students, rather than relying on control measures. We will affect behavior by addressing student motivations and our own behaviors.
Our education plan will reduce the motivation to cheat. Methods other than rewards and punishments will be utilized as punishment does not motivate improved behavior. 
Students will play an active and thoughtful role in shaping our rules of behavior. Children deserve representation and the right to participate in decisions affecting them.
We will work with students on a human level that stimulates intellectual, artistic, and technical originality.  Students will treat others as they want to be treated and will develop appropriate strategies to use when interacting with others.
Children need practice making choices.  Actions have consequences.  Students will be responsible for their behaviors and will reflect on the effects their actions have on others.
The secret to success is the ability to make the right choices.  Listing pros and cons, identifying and evaluating options, and weighing facts carefully are methods that will be introduced and modeled.
We Will Stand Firm on Tolerance.
Bullying will not be tolerated.
We will work to increase the self esteem of all students, which will soothe the unheard needs of those who bully.  We will require all students to understand and sign a contract specifying that bullying behavior will not be tolerated.
We believe that by offering a way to bring bullying behavior to a public venue through our People's Court, its power will be lessened.  We will not tolerate berating, will work with students to understand why they have a need to insult and then help them to learn productive behaviors.

Students Who Learn Differently
Students with learning challenges will have unique opportunities to focus on who they are and how they learn. We will ensure that all students, especially those with learning challenges, focus on their abilities. 
TLC will welcome families who seek alternatives to relying on medications and those who want to work towards discontinuing medication for their child(ren). TLC will provide support, a conducive environment and dietary choices appropriate for children with learning challenges.

TOGETHER,
WE can begin changing lives and our nation's education choices!

We need funds to make True Learning Cooperative a reality for area families, to show that our plan is a feasible business model that can be replicated and to spawn a revolution in education reform!
We have our progressive literature and arts based education plan. We have developed plans to convert three office suites into our campus, and continue to evaluate other possibilities in our area. We want our campus to be large enough to to serve 282 students.


In Florida, charter schools are funded and controlled by the county districts and are restricted by many of the same constraints as public schools. 


Private schools are not accredited or certified by the state. However the states does have standards for the schools receiving scholarships. TLC will accept scholarships and will be in compliance with the state to do so.


Where will your money be invested?
    $50,000     Renovations for Our Campus and First Year of Rent
True Learning Cooperative will also be funded by tuition and state scholarships. These funds will pay for teachers' salaries and administration.
We will also earn revenue by offering yoga classes and healthy beverages and snacks during non-school hours and summer camps to meet the needs and interests of our area's older students.
Yes, TLC is a For-Profit Venture.  
We believe that an investor-based for-profit school can succeed and be more innovative than a non-profit school.  We will charge the amount the state pays for scholarships for tuition, and many of our students will be on scholarships. We will supplement tuition with yoga classes, workshops on health and nutrition, and our sales of juices and smoothies. 
We are focused on efficiency and logic. As we grow and prosper, so will our educational programming, and the benefits we can provide to the community and its families.
JOIN US!  With YOUR SUPPORT, WE will prove our education model raises achievement, and accomplishes our every goal. True Learning Cooperative will illustrate how to create a successful school that serves its students and its families, Today, Tomorrow and Beyond. 
THIS IS NOT AN ENTIRELY NEW IDEA! 
Progressive private schools are changing the educational landscape by advancing the ideas that students should play an active role in shaping their own futures, should have voices and choices, and utilize self-governing.

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hola, mi nombre es Arturo y soy Lic. en Producción de Audio Digital tengo 30 años y soy un chico normal pero con <b>sueños y metas muy grandes</b>, de los cuales uno de los más importantes es crear un lugar donde puedas obtener conocimiento multimedia <b>sin costo alguno</b>, donde puedas entrar y aprender de <b>forma fácil, rápida y sencilla</b> como solo dar play al botón de YouTube. Por esa razón, he creado el canal de ""Illumium Tutoriales"", el cual puedes visitar con toda la confianza dando clic aquí: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZq2oR8BcjLw5ja5c7LtJ-g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Illumium Tutoriales - YouTube Channel</a></span>

</div><div>El canal nace de la necesidad de contenido de <b>fácil acceso</b> y digerible para todos, ya que hay muchos hermanos de habla hispana que no tienen la posibilidad de comprar cursos o pagar universidades, las cuales enseñan estos programas con <b>costos muy elevados</b> o cuando son baratas te los dan de forma mediocre y claro diciendo ""Sigue el nivel Medio"" y luego el ""Nivel Avanzado"" y luego el ""Master"" y .... bueno, ya sabes, cuando menos lo esperas ya has invertido miles de dólares de granito en granito.</div><div>Cansado de este tipo de educación que solo les importa el dinero y no los alumnos fue la razón de la creación de este medio, aquí no importa tu religión, el sexo, edad, la raza o el estatus socio económico, <b>todos son bienvenidos</b>, pero como todo hogar necesita mantenimiento y esa es la razón de la campaña.</div><div>Por cuestiones de la fuerza mayor (cosa del clima) mi computadora fue dañada y ahora no puedo continuar con esta labor que para mi es un placer, me han proporcionado una laptop para poder continuar de forma básica, contestando mensajes en la página de Facebook (<a href=""http://on.fb.me/1psZwTQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://on.fb.me/1psZwTQ</a>) , en YouTube o del grupo (<a href=""http://on.fb.me/1XAv4SV)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://on.fb.me/1XAv4SV)</a> Por lo cual me encuentro recaudando fondos para una nueva PC.</div><div>

Hola, mi nombre es Arturo y soy Lic. en Producción de Audio Digital tengo 30 años y soy un chico normal pero con sueños y metas muy grandes, de los cuales uno de los más importantes es crear un lugar donde puedas obtener conocimiento multimedia sin costo alguno, donde puedas entrar y aprender de forma fácil, rápida y sencilla como solo dar play al botón de YouTube. Por esa razón, he creado el canal de ""Illumium Tutoriales"", el cual puedes visitar con toda la confianza dando clic aquí: Illumium Tutoriales - YouTube Channel



El canal va creciendo poco a poco, justo el 24 de Diciembre éramos 1000 suscriptores, a los cuales llamo ""mis iluminados"", actualmente somos  4,000 y seguimos creciendo, todo con el firme objetivo de que el conocimiento sea libre.
El canal nace de la necesidad de contenido de fácil acceso y digerible para todos, ya que hay muchos hermanos de habla hispana que no tienen la posibilidad de comprar cursos o pagar universidades, las cuales enseñan estos programas con costos muy elevados o cuando son baratas te los dan de forma mediocre y claro diciendo ""Sigue el nivel Medio"" y luego el ""Nivel Avanzado"" y luego el ""Master"" y .... bueno, ya sabes, cuando menos lo esperas ya has invertido miles de dólares de granito en granito.Cansado de este tipo de educación que solo les importa el dinero y no los alumnos fue la razón de la creación de este medio, aquí no importa tu religión, el sexo, edad, la raza o el estatus socio económico, todos son bienvenidos, pero como todo hogar necesita mantenimiento y esa es la razón de la campaña.Por cuestiones de la fuerza mayor (cosa del clima) mi computadora fue dañada y ahora no puedo continuar con esta labor que para mi es un placer, me han proporcionado una laptop para poder continuar de forma básica, contestando mensajes en la página de Facebook (http://on.fb.me/1psZwTQ) , en YouTube o del grupo (http://on.fb.me/1XAv4SV) Por lo cual me encuentro recaudando fondos para una nueva PC.


La magnitud de esto llegará hasta donde mi vida alcance, ya que tengo muchos proyectos a futuro con todos ustedes, como el de fundar una escuela presencial de estudios multimedia para jóvenes, niños y adultos de bajos recursos, uno nunca sabe de donde vendrá el próximo DaVinci, además de crearemos videojuegos gratuitos, un estudio de fotogrametría,  desarrollo de tecnología 3D, organización de convenciones y ¿porqué no? nuestro propio motor de videojuegos,  una consola o entrar al mundo de la impresión 3D biológica.
Suena muy ""guajiro"" dirían mis paisanos Mexicanos, lo sé, pero cada día doy un paso más con la ayuda de mis queridos iluminados que me inspiran a seguir adelante a pesar de las adversidades, ya comenzamos por el lado educativo, sigamos más adelante. 



Para continuar con este proyecto se necesitan cuatro mil billetes de los verdes o dólares, sé que pensarás ""¿WTF! quieres una computadora de la NASA?"" ... básicamente no, pero necesito una PC que pueda permitirme realizar muchas tareas al mismo tiempo como hacer Renderizado mientras grabo los tutoriales, como los que realicé para el MEGACURSO de VRay:


Cuando tenga que hacer varios videos, poder grabar mientras renderizo otro video, que los que saben conocen sobre el tema me darán la razón sobre el tiempo que se tarda en procesar un video y los que no, lo veremos en un curso de PremierPro y AfterEffects, también el  renderizar en VRay mientras renderizo video y grabo lo que está ocurriendo en la pantalla ... eso si está de muerte.
Unreal Engine 4, 3DS Max, Zbrush, Photoshop, Audition, SketchUp, Blender, Marvelous Designer, After Effects, Premier Pro, Substance Suite, Quixel Suite, CorelDRAW, Make Human, World Machine, VRay, Keyshot, Marmoset Toolbag, Propellerhead Reason, FL Studio, SpeedTree, Sculptris, TopoGun y Simplygon.

Claro, si va saliendo más software con todo gusto los invitaré a ir aprendiendo juntos.
En cuestión de programación C++ y BluePrints, tendré el apoyo de un gran amigo, Juan Rodrigo Ayala, que es parte de esta grandiosa familia iluminada, él los guiará cuando llegue el momento de darle vida y acción a nuestros videojuegos y recorridos arquitectónicos.Todo el aprendizaje será en base a un proyecto AAA de un videojuego MMORPG con tecnología de Unreal Engine 4 y FreeToPlay llamado ""KARION: Breaking God's"", este tipo de juegos son muy complejos en cuestión de arquitectura y paisajismo (así que servirá para ArchViz en el subcanal Illumium Arquitectura) y además en programación de IA, animación, partículas, UI/UX, interacción PlayerToPlayer y más elementos que contienen programación (Illumium Videojuegos) en pocas palabras, aprenderás a hacer juegos calidad ""AAA"" desde 0, sin dejar a un lado la música, los SFX y tus propios ¡trailers!En cuestiones de arquitectura, tendré el apoyo de otro gran amigo y colaborador del canal, el Arq. Pablo Villavicencio, el cual estará creando los conceptos y la infraestructura que tendrá el videojuego.
Además de la PC, también se va a adquirir un micrófono para mejorar la calidad del audio de los tutoriales y una web cam para hacerlos más dinámicos, claro, no puede faltar la adquisición de un servicio de hosting y dominio para hacer más formal el canal ya con su propia página web donde sería genial poder aplicar un sistema de aulas virtuales para poder dar clases en vivo.






El obstáculo más grande que puedo encontrar a lo largo del camino, es que no se llegue a la meta y te preguntarás ¿Qué pasará con el dinero recaudado Arturo? 
Si llegara a pasar, tendría que continuar el canal pero con un flujo de trabajo más lento por que se grabaría remotamente y claro, como la PC no es mía, tendría un horario de trabajo reducido para no afectar los tiempos de Juan Rodrigo que ya hizo mucho proporcionándome su computador.
Compraría el micrófono, la web cam y si es posible el sitio web.
Yo confío plenamente en todos, como pueden ver, no es una causa personal, es de todos, que beneficiará no solo a los actuales iluminados si no a los que vienen, ya que mi meta es crear el canal de tutoriales de habla hispana más grande e importante del mundo en cuestiones 3D.
Tengo consiente que no todo es gratis en esta vida, les muestro cuales serán las recompensas a seguir en esta campaña.




De antemano comprendo que muchos de mis iluminados, familiares, amigos y conocidos no pueden aportar por cualquier situación personal, pero aún así pueden colaborar con la causa. 
Hagan ECO con esta campaña, difúndanla en sus redes sociales, en su facebook, en grupos, en su twitter, en instagram, en cualquier lugar que pueda colocarse una publicación, eso es muchísima ayuda, lo cual le dará credibilidad y crecimiendo a éste, el proyecto de todos.
Pueden utilizar las herramientas de IndieGogo para poder compartir esta campaña.

</div><h3><b>My project</b></h3><p>My dream and my goal is to open in Moscow creative workshop studio with showroom to design and sell clothes and accessories of wonderful african wax printed fabric.</p><p>I love creativity and I make some handmade things. That’s why it was easy for me to fall in love with the bright colors of CAPULANA - a cotton wax printed fabric with vibrant colors and various traditional African patterns. And as well with a creativity of Mozambican artists generally. The CAPULANA fabric (type of sarong used by Mozambican women) and all that are made of it inspired me to start designing clothes, accessories and interior decoration of this fabric and to introduce them to the Russian people. What I want is to show and tell Russians about Africa with my creativity and creativity of African artists bringing these vibrant colors with joy of life.</p><p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457904766/awaefkropi8bv3y75rrx.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 408px;height: 272px;background-color: initial;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457906650/gl3vol3igo6tlu7xahbx.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 181.012px;height: 272px;""/></p><br/><h3>My story

Milima. I was born and
raised in Kazakhstan, then my adult years was living in Russia. 3 years ago I
married a Mozambican and came to live in Mozambique. This is a really beautiful
land with a wonderful nature.</p><p></p><p>All pictures are taken

years. Africa is a completely different world for Europeans. Much of the
culture and mentality is totally incomprehensible and even perturbs you. The way of
life is completely different. There is a lot of poverty here and very low
standard of living.</p>
<p>BUT! You know what
struck me here? These are people. Despite all the difficulties and hardships of
life they are cheerful, open, somewhat childishly careless and radiate the joy
of life. They are grateful for that little they have. </p>
<p>The second thing that
struck me is the bright African colors with traditional fabrics called here CAPULANA.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">In Mozambique every
woman has and wears CAPULANA. But not only in Mozambique. It is widely spread
also in other areas of south-eastern Africa. It can eather be used as a wrop-around skirt, dress or become a baby carrier on the back. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">In real exists much more way </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">how it is used.</span></p><p style=""font-style: italic;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457905746/av0ysozi0klvajuss0zn.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;width: 187.887px;height: 145px;background-color: initial;""/> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457906489/kxmiami06lvjnjvq8m32.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;width: 108px;height: 162px;background-color: initial;""/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">  </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457906541/qztlggcekfyb6ksjdung.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;width: 208.05px;height: 146px;background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p></p><p>That's impossible not

<h3><b>What if I won’t raise the full amount</b></h3>
<p>If I won’t raise the full amount? Well .... I will be
grateful for all collected amount. Any amount that I will raise I will use to
buy fabric and sewing equipment. If the funds will not be sufficient for the
opening the studio, I'll sew and sell clothes through internet sites
livemaster.ru and etsy.com with a worldwide delivery. I will also search for shops
to place my clothes for sale. At any case the part of all my profits I will send to communities caring for children and women in Mozambique.</p>

<p>Mozambique is considered one of the
poorest and least developed countries in the world. According to UNICEF (2010),
in 2008/2009, 21.5 million people in Mozambique, 55% of the population live
below the poverty line with about half a US dollar per day. According to the
2010 world development indicators, life expectancy from birth is about 50
years. The mortality of children under five years in Mozambique is the 16th largest
in the world.</p>
<p>According to UNICEF (2010) one of
two Mozambican children suffer from chronic malnutrition and it is responsible
for 15% of infant mortality.</p>
<p>It is estimated there are 1.8
million orphans in Mozambique, of which 510,000 due to AIDS. Despite the
efforts of the Ministry of Health of Mozambique, the situation of AIDS in the
country is extremely serious (about 20% of the population carries the virus).</p>
<p>Access to electricity: 14% of the
population (Ministry of Energy, 2010).</p>
<p>Despite having huge water resources,
yet it has low water supply coverage (43.9%) and the majority of the rural
population still consumes inadequate water.</p>
<p>62.4% without access to health
services (the country occupies position 183 among 191 countries analyzed the
density of physicians)</p>
<p>Unemployment: almost a quarter of
the population is unemployed</p>
<p>Infant mortality: 90 deaths of
children under one year per 1,000 live births (Brazil: 21 Russia: 10 Canada: 5
USA: 7)</p>

93% ...). The population has only 1.2 years of schooling</p>
<p>Proportion of population using
sanitation services: 31% (2006).</p>
<p>The population is still
predominantly rural, with agriculture basically subsistence.</p>
<p>A major problem is the incidence of
HIV. In 2000 it was estimated that 12.2% of the adult population was infected,
reaching 25% in some regions. Thus, there are more than 500 000 children lost
their father, mother or both to AIDS.</p>

My projectMy dream and my goal is to open in Moscow creative workshop studio with showroom to design and sell clothes and accessories of wonderful african wax printed fabric.I love creativity and I make some handmade things. That’s why it was easy for me to fall in love with the bright colors of CAPULANA - a cotton wax printed fabric with vibrant colors and various traditional African patterns. And as well with a creativity of Mozambican artists generally. The CAPULANA fabric (type of sarong used by Mozambican women) and all that are made of it inspired me to start designing clothes, accessories and interior decoration of this fabric and to introduce them to the Russian people. What I want is to show and tell Russians about Africa with my creativity and creativity of African artists bringing these vibrant colors with joy of life.    My story

Hello! My name is Yana
Milima. I was born and
raised in Kazakhstan, then my adult years was living in Russia. 3 years ago I
married a Mozambican and came to live in Mozambique. This is a really beautiful
land with a wonderful nature.All pictures are taken
by meNow I live here for 2
years. Africa is a completely different world for Europeans. Much of the
culture and mentality is totally incomprehensible and even perturbs you. The way of
life is completely different. There is a lot of poverty here and very low
standard of living.
BUT! You know what
struck me here? These are people. Despite all the difficulties and hardships of
life they are cheerful, open, somewhat childishly careless and radiate the joy
of life. They are grateful for that little they have. 
The second thing that
struck me is the bright African colors with traditional fabrics called here CAPULANA.In Mozambique every
woman has and wears CAPULANA. But not only in Mozambique. It is widely spread
also in other areas of south-eastern Africa. It can eather be used as a wrop-around skirt, dress or become a baby carrier on the back. In real exists much more way how it is used.    That's impossible not
to fall in love with these colors.
So CAPULANA inspired
me for this project.

Why i want to open my workshop studio in Moscow? Because it's a great city and a place where live many interesting and advanced people. In addition, I love Moscow. In Moscow there is a
very interesting place. This is a former factory with a huge area which is now
organized as a platform for creative people. You can see about this place here http://flacon.ru
  This will be a great
location for my workshop studio. At first I plan to invite 3 seamstresses who
together with me will sew items in my designs and samples at the workshop. And
also I plan to employ 2 sales representatives. For a start it will be several models of
skirts, women's dresses, children's dresses, trousers, cooking aprons,
decorative pillows, beach bags and sets of tableware. In the future we will
expand our product range. Believe me I have hundreds of ideas for this.
Also with my project I want to contribute in the fight against a poverty in Africa. To do this I want to
deduct a part of the profits in the communities which are engaged in helping children
and women in Mozambique. I have found and selected 4 communities which engaged in helping Mozambican women and children. ..............................................................................................................................................

Everything you buy
from Studio CAPULANA will help feed a hungry child in Africa or help with
scholarship or help with getting professional education for women in Africa.
One more education is a one more future. 
..............................................................................................................................................
What I am going to do
in my workshop studio
The main my passion is skirts. But as well i plan to design many other things of this wonderful fabric like woman dresses, children's dresses, trousers, beach bags, accessories for a house and much more. Here are some samples
of what I plan to design. These are just samples. But my ideas of design you
will be able to see if you help me to achieve my dream.

   
                           
I am happy to accept all your ideas and suggestions on what you'd like to see or have from capulana. Write it in comments please! And any your questions, feedbacks and requests as well. 
I am in love with all African
art. That’s why  in the showroom of my
studio I want to put on a sale great items of talented Mozambican artists which
are simply breathtaking and dazzling. Here are a few examples of such handcrafts
which I love so much:

     

So wonderful, aren’t they? These photos
I took when I visited the fair of handcrafts in Maputo, capital of Mozambique. I
hope you will share my feelings. Russians will be able to get acquainted with
the wonderful art of Africa and buy unusual gifts for themselves and for loved
ones. And talented Mozambican craftsmen will get more money for their work as well.
The impact  
I’m
passionate about my project. This is my dream of
self-expression, creativity, independence, bringing a little more color and joy
to people's lives. 
This
is why your help is so important for me to achieve my dream.
What We Need   
I am raising 20000$ to open the workshop studio with showroom.
With this money I will be able to:
buy a wax fabric for a first
run to fill the showroom, rent a room for a studio for
the first 3 month, buy 3 sewing machines, buy needed trade and sewing
equipment for the studio, buy sewing accessories,
tags, labels, buy the items of African
artists, hire 3 seamstresses and two
sellers, order the signboard for the
studio, pay online stores

to place my clothes for sale. At any case the part of all my profits I will send to communities caring for children and women in Mozambique.
And for those who are still reading
this and want to know more…..I want to tell more about why I want to help women
and children in Mozambique.
Why and to whom I want to help?

</div></div>","Please Help Me
After I attempted to expose bad practice at Individual Solutions SK providing care for vulnerable adults and the elderly, I have been subjected to
continued harassment and abuse that persists today. I even attempted to get the
GMB Trade Union involved so that I could have someone fighting my corner, but
they refused to support me. I turned to
Manchester’s Employment Tribunal, in the hope that
malpractice would be exposed. Key witnesses were prevented from giving evidence
by an extremely hostile judge, who made personal attacks on me. They wouldn’t
even hear a witness who had travelled 200 miles on my behalf. Instead, the
tribunal ruled against me, despite documented evidence in support of my
case. 
Many
whistleblowers are threatened with cost orders, so they are forced to withdraw
their case. I have been ordered to pay £5,000 in costs, but I won’t back down.I have received a recent email from Stockport Council legal team they are taking instructions to enforce the cost judgement.
 You
can read the full story on my website www.olesi.com
Please help me
pay the cost order I believe that the more we stand up and say that we will not
accept this treatment, together we will send a ""strong message"" that
we stand up against bullies and Injustice.
   What's Needed  
Pay Individual
Solutions SK and Stockport Council £5,000 as ordered by the Manchester Tribunal Court
If more money
is raised I will pay court  fees approximately £3,600 and use the remaining money to campaign for a change in the law to protect whistleblowers
like me, adults and vulnerable elderly and hope that by raising awareness of my
case in the press, others will have the courage to fight.   
What You Get

A perk depending on your contribution. As well as Self-achievement
because of your help, change will happen now and other generations will benefit from your bravery. You will be
part of history.

Mi nombre es Christian Jiménez.  Soy productor audiovisual especializado en producción de radio, televisión y espectáculos para niños.  Desde hace más de 20 años fundé el proyecto La Pájara Pinta, con el cual pretendemos llevar alegría a la niñez por medio de la música infantil tradicional y original.

Escogimos y creamos el personaje de La Pájara Pinta porque su mención remite a la niñez y a la música vivida por todas las generaciones actuales.

Nuestro trabajo en Televisión,
Radio y Shows en todo el país, nos ha permitido la cercanía con los docentes y
padres de familia de centros educativos pobres, quienes nos manifiestan la necesidad de espacios lúdicos,
artísticos y culturales.

El proyecto Amigos de La Pájara Pinta pretende llevar de manera gratuita para 50 centros educativos en desventaja social.
 

Nuestros espectáculos propician
momentos de sana convivencia.  Son
válvulas de escape del estrés, las angustias y las tristezas con las que viven
a diario los chiquitines en sus entornos. Vuelven a ser niños y disfrutan como
tales.

Nadie más en Costa Rica está realizando un trabajo como este.  Es necesario llevarlo a cabo.
