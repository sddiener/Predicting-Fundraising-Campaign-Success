Who We Are 
The Millay Colony for the Arts’ artists residency program
and arts center is located in Austerlitz, NY on a seven-acre campus bordered by
the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay's former house and gardens and the beautiful
Harvey Mountain State Forest. 
In our forty-year history, we have hosted more than 2,500
composers, visual artists and writers from all cultures and communities. 
Today’s Millay Colony offers residencies of one month and two weeks as well as Virtual Residencies to 64 artists between April and November each year. Residencies are provided
FREE to select artists each year following a juried selection process. In
addition, we offer a series of related activities including: Workshop Retreats in writing and art on our gorgeous campus; Weekend Workshops on a range of subjects in NYC; and free Master Classes in writing and art at local schools.



Your Participation is ESSENTIAL And We Have So Many Beautiful Ways to Reward You
Without your help we won't be able to offer residencies to these FOUR artists, offering them the time and space to make and refine their art.  In our fast-paced and
tech-heavy world, time is a tremendously vital part of the artistic process—the
time to work that culminates in published or recorded or exhibited work.  At Millay, we make time a priority.  And that means that there will be more poems,
plays, novels, films, operas, songs, paintings, sculptures, etchings etc. that
can come into the world with YOUR help.  
4 ARTISTS + ONE MONTH EACH OF TIME, STUDIO AND LIVING SPACE,
NOURISHMENT, COLLABORATION = MANY NEW ARTISTIC WORKS BROUGHT INTO THIS WORLD IN 2014

<p>Don't just take our word for it! Check out the <b><i>testimonials</i></b> from our happy Users:</p>
<p><i>“So exciting … great results. I really started struggling with cellulite on the backs of my legs and bottom over the past four years. I like being able to feel the pressure points and increased blood flow. I could feel the warmth in fifteen minutes and some tingling when I stood up. I look forward to continued use and improvement of the appearance of my unwanted cellulite! Thank you! ""</i> - Cyndy E., Age 37</p>
<p><i> “I want to now put this on my stomach, the front of my legs, arms … I want it everywhere!  It was comfortable to sit on and I could see a big change.  It would make me more comfortable at the beach, even in the gym, and definitely in the bedroom!  Can you make them in leopard?  If I start using this now (age 20) … imagine how my thighs will look in a year?“ </i>- Alice D.  <br/></p>

You’ve tried creams and procedures, yo-yo diets and fad
exercises to work on your backside, buttocks or bottom ... or as we like to call it, your 'B-Half.
BUTT
have you settled for just hiding your hyde? Cellulite affects over 90% percent of women and 10% of men in the US alone.  It's genetic.  
You're invited - try our SweetCheeks on yours. 

Who We Are and What We're About:


At SweetCheeks Products, Inc., we are committed to developing anti-cellulite products that are effective and complement your daily routine.  If a product requires you to take time out of your day, or spend money again and again, it wasn't invented here.  And if it doesn't help your back shelf, you won't find it on our front shelf!
We've launched our Company in Austin, TX, the Silicon Hills of Technology.  We are changing the landscape from ""software"" to ""thigh-tech"" as our contribution toward Keeping Austin Weird!

The
SweetCheeks advantages: 


Results you'll see about one hour.

No recurring costs ... just buy one!

Convenient to use; sit on this!

No messy creams to apply






So What is it and How Does it Work?



SweetCheeks™ is a patent-pending portable and flexible mat 
that: 


Provides temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite 
Provides a temporary increase in local circulation
Provides temporary relief of minor muscle aches and pains
Provides temporary relief of minor muscle spasms


SweetCheeks achieves these results by leveraging your body weight 
against the textured surface of the mat - creating a therapeutic massage.  Just sit on it!  You'll feel the tingling sensation that lets you know the mat is working.  After 30 minutes, remove the mat.  Notice the impressions of the textured surface, which will begin to fade after 1 hour.





This 
resulting massage improves local circulation, while reducing the 
appearance of cellulite for hours and even into the next day. Wake up, sit again!  Nothing to plug in, no batteries.  This is thigh tech business ... just the power of your body working on your B-Half.  
Photos unretouched and our photographer willing to testify to what she saw, too!





We take what works (massage) and make the impractical, practical!   No time out of your routine and no recurring costs.  
You'll watch the impression from the textured surface fade over the next hour into results as seen above in our After photo.  Results may vary.  

Don't just take our word for it! Check out the testimonials from our happy Users:
“So exciting … great results. I really started struggling with cellulite on the backs of my legs and bottom over the past four years. I like being able to feel the pressure points and increased blood flow. I could feel the warmth in fifteen minutes and some tingling when I stood up. I look forward to continued use and improvement of the appearance of my unwanted cellulite! Thank you! "" - Cyndy E., Age 37
 “I want to now put this on my stomach, the front of my legs, arms … I want it everywhere!  It was comfortable to sit on and I could see a big change.  It would make me more comfortable at the beach, even in the gym, and definitely in the bedroom!  Can you make them in leopard?  If I start using this now (age 20) … imagine how my thighs will look in a year?“ - Alice D.

<p>Quello che m’interessa è osservare e indagare la vita delle persone, la loro condizione umana e sociale, attraverso la cronaca, il cinema, la musica, la letteratura. Mi interessano le distorsioni del comportamento che questi nostri tempi provocano nelle persone, il modo in cui la vita privata e la vita pubblica si scontrano.</p>
<p>Per entrare in contatto con la realtà che mi sta intorno, per raccontarla, mi affido al filo delle emozioni, che sempre rende tutto noi più sensibili, più vicini, uguali agli altri.</p>
<p>Ora, per realizzare il mio nuovo progetto artistico ho bisogno del tuo aiuto.</p>
<p>Il progetto si chiama <strong>Evil Sisters (Perfide Sorelle)</strong>. Si tratta di una video-installazione correlata da una serie fotografica ed è incentrato sui problemi relativi ai conflitti tra donne. Da una parte l’amicizia e la complicità e dall’altra l'invidia, la rivalità.</p>
<p>Le protagoniste di <strong>Evil Sisters (Perfide Sorelle)</strong> saranno due giovani attrici accompagnate da una cinquantina di comparse, tutte donne. Il luogo dove gireremo è la storica sala da ballo torinese Le Roy, aperta ancora oggi, progettata dal grande architetto e artista Carlo Mollino, anche lui di Torino, nel 1959.</p>
<p>Le riprese si realizzeranno in un solo giorno a fine marzo quindi saranno importantissime le fasi preparatorie. Ogni aspetto del lavoro dovrà essere perfettamente funzionante, come fosse una vera e propria performance, perché non ci sarà possibilità di replica. È per questo che sarà necessario ingaggiare un gruppo di professionisti capaci di garantire un’organizzazione veramente efficace del set.</p>
<p>Il tuo contributo sarà determinante per aiutarmi a concretizzare <strong>Evil Sisters</strong>. Un'indagine sul conflitto, il mistero, l’energia inspiegabile che lega una donna a tutte le altre.</p>

Le riprese si realizzeranno in un solo giorno a fine marzo quindi saranno importantissime le fasi preparatorie. Ogni aspetto del lavoro dovrà essere perfettamente funzionante, come fosse una vera e propria performance, perché non ci sarà possibilità di replica. È per questo che sarà necessario ingaggiare un gruppo di professionisti capaci di garantire un’organizzazione veramente efficace del set.
Il tuo contributo sarà determinante per aiutarmi a concretizzare Evil Sisters. Un'indagine sul conflitto, il mistero, l’energia inspiegabile che lega una donna a tutte le altre.
La prima mostra che inaugurerà la video-installazione Evil Sister si terrà a Bari, presso la galleria Muratcentoventidue http://www.muratcentoventidue.com/, a maggio 2013.
Please, support me!
Grazie.

<p><em> “We have committed the last 30 years to the work of TIMOTCA in the  belief that the cause of Peace can be advanced through the Universal Language of Art.</em></p>
<p><em>This Generation’s unprecedented vision of the ‘whole earth’ from space, unparalleled communication technology and the realities of Earth’s fragile ecosystems have combined to create an expanded need for people everywhere to communicate with one another and to explore their inter-connectedness.  The people of the world need a gathering place for the world’s cultures, which will reflect a newly-found global consciousness.</em></p>
<p><em>While International art museums exist around the world, none exhibit the works of more than a few nations, and <strong>none represent all the people of the world</strong>.  TIMOTCA will strive to fill this need with the creation of  the TIMOTCA Centre, a unifying cultural and artistic achievement – a United Nations of the Arts.</em></p>
<p><em>The Art Beyond Borders Exhibitions and The TIMOTCA Centre will reinforce the connection we all share through the creative spirit.

We are anxious to share this amazing story and to offer you the opportunity to participate in a program like no other.


Opening the senses to the breathtaking experience of the connecting spirit  of creativity found everywhere on earth, Art Beyond Borders is a global event working to foster peace and cultural understanding in a world of separateness, violence and strained communications.
Traveling to over 60 countries, TIMOTCA has brought together the world’s greatest artists in an effort to expose that which binds us, creating an unprecedented global exhibition.
Art Beyond Borders is meant to help uplift and enlighten, while exploring our shared humanity as expressed through the creative process found in every country on earth – the common bond uniting the human family…the essence within all of us that has the power to change he world.
To date, over 60 countries and cultures, representing a broad spectrum of political, economic and cultural diversity, have accepted TIMOTCA’s invitation to participate in TIMOTCA and Art Beyond Borders. TIMOTCA will continue to expand Art Beyond Borders until all countries are represented and its message of ""art in pursuit of peace"" is heard around the world.

TIMOTCA’s Art Beyond Borders exhibition of the original paintings, premiered at United Nations Headquarters in New York and UNESCO Headquarters, Paris.

 

Art Beyond Borders, a collection never before achieved in history, is  now making its way across America in colorful canvas art banner format – making it easily accessible to the largest audience possible. An interactive teacher’s guide combining projectable images with reproducible worksheets maximizes the benefits of the exhibition. The guide includes critiquing lessons, artist and country information, art activities and mapping activities, with versions for all student levels. 
  





The current Indiegogo Campaign presents the works of 42 renowned artists officially selected to represent their respective countries… countries of vast political, philosophical and social differences.  It offers an unprecedented collection of art gathered from master artists from Albania to Zimbabwe, all joined together in a singular mission – “art in pursuit of peace.”  

To see the art from each country please visit the “Artists” page at www.timotca.org

Chicago

Orlando
San Francisco
On its way to the United Nations.

Aaron Kelsey, Art Teacher at Madison Consolidated High School, Indiana
""I'm getting students to think about how art is a universal language that breaks language barriers – the art in Art Beyond Borders is from all over    the world - big cultural cross-section. The diversity teaches students about the world.”
 

TIMOTCA is a non-profit 501 (c) (3) educational and charitable corporation founded in 1980.  TIMOTCA’s goal is to foster global peace and cultural understanding through the universal language of art and to build the world’s first global Peace Monument and Cultural Centre presenting the visual   and performing arts of every country, territory and island group of the world and as many cultures as possible.www.timotca.org



 
 “We have committed the last 30 years to the work of TIMOTCA in the  belief that the cause of Peace can be advanced through the Universal Language of Art.
This Generation’s unprecedented vision of the ‘whole earth’ from space, unparalleled communication technology and the realities of Earth’s fragile ecosystems have combined to create an expanded need for people everywhere to communicate with one another and to explore their inter-connectedness.  The people of the world need a gathering place for the world’s cultures, which will reflect a newly-found global consciousness.
While International art museums exist around the world, none exhibit the works of more than a few nations, and none represent all the people of the world.  TIMOTCA will strive to fill this need with the creation of  the TIMOTCA Centre, a unifying cultural and artistic achievement – a United Nations of the Arts.
The Art Beyond Borders Exhibitions and The TIMOTCA Centre will reinforce the connection we all share through the creative spirit. You can become part of a rare moment in history as you join this innovative path toward peace –  a global campaign to make the TIMOTCA vision a reality.""

Vlasta Livi, TIMOTCA Director of International Research

For many years the representatives of TIMOTCA (The International Museum Of Twenty-first Century Arts) have traveled the globe meeting with Heads of State, educators, business leaders, diplomats, artists and cultural representatives, securing country participation and assembling a rare and precious collection of art, which has been organized as the Art Beyond Borders Exhibition. Ultimately, every country in the world will be represented.


 
Whether through travel or dialogue, laughter, diplomacy, music or art, any way we can experience our shared humanity  is a path to peace. The Art Beyond Borders Exhibition is a milestone along that path.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have recently completed a Master of Design in Visual Communication from the University of Derby and have been working freelance as an illustrator for about a year. I  enjoy creating work using a more traditional method of ink, fineliner and charcoal to create atmospheric pieces that convey particualr themes.</p>
<p>This project: <em>the errand...</em> is my first picture book for children and has been created from 2 years of intensive research and creative responses. This book explores themes of fear and separation through visual storytelling. I am keen to push the boundaries of visual communication to create the contrasting sensations of fear and safety in my work through perspective and tone. The work illustrates the emotions of the characters and aids the reader in empathising and engaging with the narrative of the book.</p>
<p>The book follows two siblings in their first journey alone from their family home in a block of flats. They have been sent to the local store and the story illustrates their uncertainty of the outside world and their comfort of having each other during this unfamiliar journey.</p>
<p>This book is designed to be shared by a parent or guardian with a child in order for them to develop the childs first experiences of independence. This books is entirely visual and encourages the readers to individually intepret the theme and tone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>When I completed this project I hand printed and bound one copy of <em>the errand...</em> for display at the university degree show. This copy forms part of my creative portfolio which means that until now I haven't been able to distribute duplicate copies for people to enjoy at home.</p>
<p>My target of £600 will cover the high quality re-printing of of <em>the errand...</em> plus the printing and framing of 10 high quality art prints taken from pages of the book to use as part of an exhibition to raise awareness of the book.</p>
<p>If the total amount of £600 is not reached then I will lower the amount of books or prints that are produced. So every penny that you donate will still help me to fund this venture regardless of whether I reach the target or not.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I have offered a range of contibution amounts and even the smallest donation is greatly appreciated. As well as generating the funds, spreading the word for my project is equally as important so please share this with your friends and family if you think they would be interested in my campaign.</p>
<p>Many thanks for reading,</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Sandra Blair and I'm a wildlife artist.  My career goal for the past 10 years has been to have one of my paintings accepted into Birds in Art, an international competiton at the Woodson Art Museum in Wausau WI.  Birds in Art is one of the most prestigious exhibitions an avian artist could be a part of.  Out of a field of 940 entries submitted by 577 artists from all around the world, only 120 artists were invited to participate.  Imagine my excitement when I recieved the notice that I was one of them!  The image above is of my accepted painting, SUn Catcher, 14 x 18"" acrylic on gessobord.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Woodson Art Museum treats the participating artists in style, providing lodging, meals and transportation for the opening weekend, Sept. 6-9 2012.  All we need to do is get there!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's where your contributioons are greatly needed...let me give you a little more info to help you make your decision.  On June 28, I was hospitalized for a week with two heart attacks and two strokes.  My right arm function was severely compromised along with my left leg and my vision.  Doctors are stumped as to the causes as I have no heart disease or blocked arteries of any kind.  Tests are still ongoing including CT scans and MRIs seraching for an explanation.  Physical and Occupational Therapy have restored a good portion of my arm and leg functions...when I began therapy, I could barely pick up a fork.  Now I'm able to feed myself, write legibly and I've begun retraining myself to draw by doing daily small sketches.  Needless to say, lost wages and medical bills are taking a huge toll on us including the fact that I'm currently unable to resume my job and my husband has been on temporary leave from his job since the end of June  to help me get around and drive me to my therapy and numerous doctor appointments. In short, we're hurting for cash!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It will be very disappointing if I can't attend the opening weekend of Birds in Art...there's no guarantee I'll be accepted into the exhibition again in the future so this may be my only opportunity to experience this incredible opportunity and to meet some of the most respected wildlife artists in the world (including some of my heros)!</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need!</h3>
<p>Air fares are so expensive right now, so my husband and I plan to drive to Wisconsin from Pennsylvania, a distance of 951 miles over 15.5 hours. </p>
<p>Here's how the funding would break down:</p>
<p>Gasoline (round trip) -- $275.00</p>
<p>Hotel for two nights (one night going and one night returning) -- $200</p>
<p>Road food -- $150</p>
<p>Unforseen expenses -- $75.00</p>
<p>As the funding is flexible, I'll receive anything you contribute, no matter how small an amount, which will help greatly toward the trip.</p>
<h3>What you'll receive in return!</h3>
<p>In return you'll receive some great perks depending on your contribuion, including my forever thanks, notecards with images of my paintings, a 2013 calendar of my art and an autographed catalog featuring all the art in Birds in Art 2012.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The impact</h3>
Your contributions will help me participate in a possibly once-in-a-lifetime experience, network with an incredible group of artists and meet some of the greatest wildlife artists in the world.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
Please spread the word to friends and colleagues as every little contribution will help me reach my goal.  Thank you so much!</div></div>","Short Summary

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> </p></div>","In a culture where art is chronically underfunded and undervalued, talented and driven women artists are being forced to choose between their artistic passions and earning a decent wage each and every day.
This needs to stop.
That's Women's Work Arts Network (TWWAN) is committed to supporting women working in all facets of arts and culture in Toronto, and doing everything in our power to help women to earn a living wage from their art. 
But we need your help.
Toronto’s vastly talented community of women artists need a space to support their work. Please join us and help to create a physically and financially accessible space for women to create, display, and acquire assistance with their art. 
We can’t do it without you.
The Space
Our dream space is a two-to-three storey house in the west end of Toronto with yard space and lots of room for us to work, experiment and build community.
Under the auspices of TWWAN, this space will:


House a gallery with the specific mandate of showing new, emerging and established works by women artists;


House an affordable recording studio, operated by Chantelle Japp (http://canadaartsconnect.com/magazine/2012/09/chantelle-japp/) featuring an interactive training program and workshops;


House Trade School Toronto classes and workshops (http://tradeschool.coop/toronto/class)


Provide work space for artists and performers, including sound-proof rehearsal spaces;


Act as an incubator for small business;


Offer affordable meeting, conference, workshop and rental spaces;


Offer cutting edge workshops on technology and the art of business,

and much much more…
 
The Impact
Your contribution to the TWWAN space allows for accessible art and culture in Toronto, with the reassurance that the same principles you apply to your coffee (fair trade) are being applied to our city’s cultural workers; 
provides an opportunity for collectors and enthusiasts to meet and develop relationships with new and emerging artists, eliminating the need for dealers and brokers;
ensures Canadian content and that our artists and performers will gain respect and security, and that women artists will find their places in the Canadian Landscape, allowing them to remain here to produce, teach, help build community and inspire.
By participating in this campaign and helping TWWAN create and provide this supportive space, you will be treating our local artists with the reverence and appreciation that occurs in other parts of the world. 
 
The Need
In order to find and fund this dream space, TWWAN is seeking $8000 in support. Where will that money go? 
start-up:
first and last month’s rent, insurance, utility connections, wifi, phone, etc.
any cosmetic touches to the space such as cleaning, painting and purchases to help hang or present art
studio gear and/or rentals for the recording studio
sound proofing, materials needed for working spaces for artists and our small business incubation spaces. 
If we don’t hit our goal of $8000, TWWAN will continue to support Toronto’s woman artists to the best of our ability, and will not stop working until we see this vision through.
If we overachieve our goal, you can rest assured all funds will go directly to resources, equipment and materials. Instead we will work to secure a large screen television or projector, purchase the materials to create sprung floors, and start a microloans program to help women ignite small business in the city and support artists in their projects. 
 
Other Ways to Help
All kinds of contributions are wonderful acts of kindness and will help.
Please take a moment to share our story by twitter, email, word of mouth or by directing folks to the website at http://thatswomensworkartsnetwork.comand to this indiegogo campaign. 
We are so very grateful for each and every effort to help That’s Women's Work find a home! Thank you.

You learn the hard way, and after the 3 shops I was in ALL eventually closed, I like to think it was time well served. I've spent every spare penny earned not paying bills and supporting my family - investing into the proper tools of the trade, and how they work, as well as countless hours hunched over tables drawing. No matter how many times asked, I have never tattooed on my own, instead preferring to learn under those I've been gracious enough to assist me in my quest . I have performed such tasks as front of shop and house artist, to cleaning and sterilization, waiting on customers to drumming up business, I've done as much as I can all in the hope of that one holy grail - the mentor in ""hands on"" tattooing. Until now. With this offer, I can focus on what I need to learn from a proper teacher, one invested in it with his life.

<p>In 1995, the visually stunning film ""Waterworld""
 was released.  A post apocalyptic film on water, it featured a number 
of great floating vehicles, action sequences, and stunts.  Besides Kevin
 Costner, the star of the film had to be the giant oil tanker turned 
floating fortress, the Exxon Valdez or, as the Smokers called it, ""The Deez"".<br/></p>
<p>For the film, a giant model of the ship was built in the Mojave 
desert.  It was used for various effects and explosions seen in the 
film.  After filming, the 100 foot long, 20 feet wide, 12 foot tall 
carcass of the ""model"" was stored at Edwards 
Air Force Base, where it sat for almost 20 years.  In 2014, it was 
purchased by Post Apocalyptic artist Ron Griffith for use as The Pirates
 of the Arid Seas tribe camp at the yearly post apocalyptic celebration,
 ""Wasteland Weekend"".   Ron and I must get it off Edwards Air Force base in three months, or the entire thing will be sold for scrap, never to be seen again.</p>The plan is to cut the Exxon Valdez into pieces and create a grounded mini-Valdez post apocalyptic trawler that measures 40 feet long by 12 feet wide.  This smaller Valdez will become the Pirates of the Arid Seas camp AND the new Wasteland Weekend Post Apocalyptic Swimsuit Contest venue!  It will also save forever, the stern of the boat with the Exxon Valdez name on it, along with other notable details from the model.<br/><br/>To do the above, we need $4999.00 dollars in funds to make a 2 piece ship with a crack in the middle (like the one picture above).  BUT, if we can raise $2500, we can make an impressive ship wreck with just the stern of the boat and a little bow part!  So whether we are able to raise the full amount, or even half that, we can still save parts of the Valdez and make an impressive post apocalyptic display!  THIS SMALLER SHIP WILL BE A YEARLY PRESENCE AT WASTELAND WEEKEND and other post apocalyptic events!<br/><br/>
<p>By donating to this IndieGoGo event, you will be saving a piece of filmic history, creating an amazing venue for an annual swimsuit contest, and giving yourself and friends an opportunity for VIP treatment with the Pirates of the Arid Seas during the 2015 Wasteland Weekend Event and beyond.<br/></p>
</div><div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This campaign is aimed at preserving pieces of  100' ""model"" of ""The Deez"" built for the compelling action film called ""Waterworld"".   As a contributor, you will be assisting in creating a post-apocalyptic wonder of the world - a grounded trawler in a sea of sand; a new home to a gaggle of ocean-influenced, landlubber pirates aching to get back to the sea during the post apocalyptic festival ""Wasteland Weekend"".  This is a chance to not only save history, but if you are a Wasteland Weekend participant, touch it and party on it.</p>
<p>The builders of this project all have much experience in building.  Ron Griffith is a master fabricator of Post Apocalyptic Cars.  I, Paul Miller, am a Prop Builder and Production Designer in films and TV, and many of our builders are members of Union 44, the film union for carpenters and artists!</p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to save a part of history, and co-exist with it in a post-apocalyptic setting.  Even if you can't attend Wasteland Weekend, there are many perks that cater to those just wanting to contribute and get a feel for the event!  CHECK OUT THE REDUCED PRICED  PERKS!!!!!!!!!<br/></p>

<p>The other challenge will be to make the ship smaller and transportable.  If we do the 2 piece, 80' version, it will be done by mounting the two ship pieces onto two car trailers.   Our goal is to keep key pieces of the Valdez and build it into a 2 piece trailerable trawler.  </p>

The Story 
 
A Gorey Demise Storybook is a project I'm executing for my 2012 Graduate Exhibition work for Simon Fraser University's School for Contemporary Arts. I've taken on hand-illustrating, printing, and binding a 28-page hardcover graphic-arts book that I will only make 12 copies of.
""A Gorey Demise"" is a written piece composed and performed by Curtis Rx and Creature Feature Music. It pays homage to one of the literary influences of the singer-songwriter's projects. A Gorey Demise begs visual representation-  challenge accepted! 
 
The text chronicles, alphabetically, a cast of characters' twisted and grisly deaths.  I will reinterpret the original text into a book that reads like a childrens storybook, but calls out a tension between its primary form and macabre content. I'll be illustrating the text with my own stylized type of characters I affectionately call Kriggles. 
Drawing this kind of quirky, creative content impassions me! The process of turning the work into this small run of high-quality books is what makes the whole project a work of art. 
 
How am I doing this?
I'm creating a series of original colour illustrations by hand in traditional media. The illustrations will be scanned and printed, then bound hardcover by hand. Ultimately, the books will be exhibited within the arts community and to project contributors. Producing a limited number of quality pieces will make each book a special sculptural work of art.
 
What I Need, And Its Impact
This is a not-for-profit project for my Graduate Exhibition piece. It will cost just over $1600 to do this. Your pledge will directly support making this piece, and paying for:

 $370 in Art Supplies: drawing paper, inking pens, and illustrative markers and cartridges 
 $150 in Printing Paper: 100lb text-weight paper cut to size for printing the book pages
 $650  in Printing and Ink costs; printing 30+ different digital files larger-format in small runs is much more expensive than printing 300 copies of a single image.
 $470 Book Binding Materials and Labor Costs & Shipping Costs
 
Raising funds is critical to the execution of this project. As a student I earn limited income from 2 part-time jobs and working the hours to make money to pay for my project will rob me of the time I need to spend illustrating the artwork for the next 2 months. I need to complete the artwork in January to begin printing, and have the work bound in February. March 2012 is my cushion month to tie up loose ends, and the Exhibition is April 2012. Your pledge will enable me to do the part of this project I'm most excited about; bring my ideas alive through illustration, and create a beautiful piece of art.
 
What if everyone's as excited about A Gorey Demise Storybook as I am, and we overfund?
If we exceed the $1600 production cost goal, 2 things will happen; I'll be able to produce an even better quality final product, and I'm committed that if there are funds left after production, I will donate a percentage  to Creature Feature Music's film and performance projects which are themselves in desperate need of funding.

Black Box is a Vending Machine to dispense independent art andliterature.  It is a way for artists to not only sell their work, butto get it out there put on display for all to see.  Everything fromBooks, Zines, DVDâ€™s, CDâ€™s, Cassettes, Toys, Postcards, or anythingcreative that is made by local artists.  All products are noncorporate, independent, local, works.  This is a great opportunityto create community and culture rather than more candy.

The Impact
The idea came one day when I was in a convenience store and realized that everything from the food to the tabloid magazines were all very unfulfilling. I decided to start a vending machine that sells nothing but local and international, independent media, easily accessible to the community.  It is a project that I would like the create into something bigger, something where every big neighborhood or even small town can have one. 

On the side of all machines, students are free to post what ever theywant from art, poems, band fliers, or even if your looking to subleaseyour apartment.  The idea is to create more of a community.  Peoplewill want to hang out around the machine.

<span>As
 someone who has been fan, proponent and originator of independent 
publishing in the past (The Key, STOP &amp; CSNA) I'm very excited to 
announce the launch of my on-line &amp; limited print edition art &amp; 
literary journal VACZINE. VACZINE will feature a varied assortment of 
photography, painting, multi-media art &amp; collage, graffiti, video, short 
stories &amp; broken werd. The extremely talented &amp; visionary art 
direct<span>or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/frank.gargiulo.9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frank Gargiulo</a> will be in charge of the design and visual presentation.</span></span> I will be serving as editor &amp; publisher. Much like my earlier and much celebrated zine STOP, VACZINE is about everything &amp; nothing. No theme yet it all comes together. Open to 
everyone to express anything. All I ask is that you always come correct 
and submit your best work. If you don't believe in it then how can you 
expect anyone else to? VACZINE is an annual publication that celebrates 
and focuses on all kinds of art, writing and visual or aural expression.
 We don't follow. We don't lead. We excel. VACZINE hopes to be a venue for artists to showcase their work in an uncensored &amp; completely open venue. <br/>VACZINE will also be curating upcoming exhibitions at The Leslie Lohman Gay &amp; Lesbian Museum &amp; Gallery that will feature the artists first seen in the magazine. <br/><br/>I am hoping to raise the printing costs for our debut issue so I can avoid the typical route of paid advertising. Instead VACZINE is giving 4 pages of advertising space for free to new designers &amp; galleries that we feel are important to watch &amp; worth supporting. Therefore I am seeking to raise $5000 to pay for the 10 deluxe editions and the remaining softcover editions which will be sold exclusively at The Leslie Lohman Museum as well as through VACZINE.<br/><br/>WALT CESSNA IS A WRITER, PHOTOGRAPHER AND FORMER FASHION DESIGNER WHO STARTED HIS CAREER IN FASHION AS A <i>VOGUE</i>

 someone who has been fan, proponent and originator of independent 
publishing in the past (The Key, STOP & CSNA) I'm very excited to 
announce the launch of my on-line & limited print edition art & 
literary journal VACZINE. VACZINE will feature a varied assortment of 
photography, painting, multi-media art & collage, graffiti, video, short 
stories & broken werd. The extremely talented & visionary art 
director Frank Gargiulo will be in charge of the design and visual presentation. I will be serving as editor & publisher. Much like my earlier and much celebrated zine STOP, VACZINE is about everything & nothing. No theme yet it all comes together. Open to 
everyone to express anything. All I ask is that you always come correct 
and submit your best work. If you don't believe in it then how can you 
expect anyone else to? VACZINE is an annual publication that celebrates 
and focuses on all kinds of art, writing and visual or aural expression.
 We don't follow. We don't lead. We excel. VACZINE hopes to be a venue for artists to showcase their work in an uncensored & completely open venue. VACZINE will also be curating upcoming exhibitions at The Leslie Lohman Gay & Lesbian Museum & Gallery that will feature the artists first seen in the magazine. I am hoping to raise the printing costs for our debut issue so I can avoid the typical route of paid advertising. Instead VACZINE is giving 4 pages of advertising space for free to new designers & galleries that we feel are important to watch & worth supporting. Therefore I am seeking to raise $5000 to pay for the 10 deluxe editions and the remaining softcover editions which will be sold exclusively at The Leslie Lohman Museum as well as through VACZINE.WALT CESSNA IS A WRITER, PHOTOGRAPHER AND FORMER FASHION DESIGNER WHO STARTED HIS CAREER IN FASHION AS A VOGUE

</h3>
<p>My name is Natalia, though I've gone under the alias of 'ZPS' for over a decade. <br/></p>
<p>Art is something that has supported me throughout my life. Through the years it has helped me develop parts of myself I find difficult to put into words. Art is a big part of what makes me grow, and it is really exciting when doing something you love has the potential to  inspire growth in others. <br/></p>
<p>When it comes to art, people often attach expectation of what they want the finished product to look like before they even start. Along the way they unintentionally fall into a 'fear' mindset of 'I can't do this' and doubt their own abilities. My intention with printing this coloring book is to ease the burden. It is very cathartic to relax into a writing instrument and see what comes out onto paper. When you are making a mark you can do no wrong! </p>
<p>When I look at an older piece of my work, I can recall where I was physically and mentally at that period of my life. The collection of pictures in this book came as a result of great flux. There are themes of self love, centering, spirit. There is nudity, there is magic. This book is meant to help an adult connect and explore with their inner child.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need  <br/>
</h3>
<p>There is an astounding number of factors that contribute to printing something. Over the last few weeks I've been collecting quotes and have settled on a company, then gone through options on sizes, paper weight, binding style, etc. Plus there are other costs that will come into play along the way- shipping, duty, etc. Also to take into account the amount of hours that went into making the images and prepping them for printing. Its been my dream for a long time to do this but I am not in a situation that I can invest in this without some help. So with much consideration, these are the goals:</p>
<p>Tier 1: Goal - $777  6x9 inch coloring books, coil bound, 70lb paper</p>
<p>This is the least expensive option. This paper would be good for pencil crayons, but not the best for markers. The pages will be single sided, but might result in some bleed through.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Stretch Goal - $1111 8.5x11 inch coloring books, coil bound, 70lb paper</p>
<p>Bigger coloring books! Same weight of paper and coiled as tier 1 but a better size for all the small details.</p>
<p>Tier 3: Fancy Stretch Goal - $1212  8.5x11 inch coloring books, coil bound, 100lb paper, vertical perforation </p>
<p>When I think of what I would love for this to look like, this is the dream. Thicker stock of paper, larger size and vertical perforation to easily rip pages out and ready to frame.</p>
<p>More money? More books! If the demand is high this gives me freedom to 
print more books, make more art, put money towards different kinds of printing.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Perks</h3>Give stuff get stuuuuuff! <br/>At these donation levels, you can also choose to have these things!

<p>To get a copy of the thing, slapped fresh off the printer, pick this one. The total book size will be determined based off of how much $$ we can pile up. If the magic number is not hit, I will fund the remainder for the lowest cost I can that I am still happy with. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The risk is on myself, and it is one I was afraid to take for a long time. Many of you that know me know that I have been talking about this for a while. The big changes over the last year have been a set back, and even setting up a campaign wasn't without its worries- what if I don't succeed? I am finally in a position where I am ready to take the leap and take a chance on myself and my passion. Any support I can get in that would be a monumental help. <br/><br/>The challenge is that I have the short deadline because I would like to attempt to make these 
in time for the YEG Whyte Avenue Art Walk on July 8-10. I will have a

<h3>MirrorrorriM: The Alchemy of Play</h3>
<p>MirrorrorriM is an art project being pioneered by a group of artists who have come together to create a giant, transportable kaleidoscope that is completely participant operated. This 30' long kaleidoscope is clad in wood and spins in-place on a series of caster wheels. At one end is a viewing chamber for folks to enjoy the show, and on the other end is our own version of the ""object chamber"" where you might find small beads or glass in a regular kaleidoscope, but not MirrorrorriM. Our object chamber is a giant wheel that participants strap their feet into and spin to create a pattern with their body, while behind them a fire wheel adds light and chaos (oh, and some heat). The whole kaleidoscope is participant-operated: it spins when several people work together to push it, and the psychedelic images are created by a real person's body turning in front of a fire wheel. Sound awesome? Read on!   </p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to get enough funding to get our project rolling! As a team, we are completely dedicated to the project and have been putting much love (and money!) into it. With your help we can take our project not only to Burning Man 2016 but also the road to be appreciated everywhere. The intention behind this project is to take it as many places as possible, so everyone can experience transformative, large-scale, interactive, community-driven art.  We have plans to take it to community events, have it installed at art galleries, and take it to schools! MirrorrorriM can be altered depending on the event: we can remove the fire element if it is not desired or we can add additional colour wheels (think Rainbows for Pride or Red and White for Canada Day!).</p>
<h3><strong>So, How Much Money do We Need? </strong></h3>
<p>We've budgeted our project to be about $30,000 and we are hoping the raise half of that with this campaign. If we do not reach the goal of our campaign, the funds will still go directly into the project and we will explore new funding avenues. </p>
<h3><strong>What's The $$ For?</strong></h3>
<p>Materials: Polycarbonate mirrors, wood siding, copper tubing, wheels, lasers (LASERS!), etc. </p>
<p>Transportation: The usual fuel costs AND a 40' trailer to build it on so that we can roll into any city and be instantly ready to delight!</p>
<h3>Perks For You!</h3>
<p>We've got some really amazing perks. We've got t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, and bandannas. We also have some handmade kaleidoscopes and some CNC'd artwork for you to enjoy any time! And there's a chance that we could bring the project to your birthday party (if you live on the west coast of North America). **</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>MirrorrirriM has the potential to make an impact in the areas of art, community, play, and science. The first thing participants will feel when they see a school-bus-sized kaleidoscope before them is a sense of awe and delight, but quickly they move into a space of gathering the folks around them into a team (or community) to get the main tube spinning. Whether we're talking about adults on playa or kids at a science centre, the project encourages communication and teamwork.

<p>One thing bout MirrorrorriM is that you get out of as much as you put into it, so that it may appear as a giant child's toy, it is in fact an alchemic transmutation device inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's genius.

<p>Mostly though, the impact of MirrorrorriM will be delight and awe. Remember when you were a kid and someone gave you a little cardboard tube rolled in coloured paper? Remember how amazed you felt when you peered inside and found an ever-changing world of colour and light? Now, let's fast forward, scale-up, and you'll find that MirrorrorriM is an epic experience that you won't soon forget. </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>We know that not everybody is in a position to donate money (although seriously, even a small sum goes a long way), but that doesn't mean you can't help. Help us spread the word about MirrorrorriM to your friends, family, and colleagues. You never know who might be interested in supporting the project or having MirrorrorriM visit their town. By sharing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or wherever you connect, you help bring us one step closer to sharing MirrorrorriM with more folks! Use the Indiegogo Sharing Tools!</p>
<p>With your help, we can make this project come alive. It will stand triumphantly on playa in Black Rock City, being enjoyed by hoards of Burners all working together to make it operate. After it's debut, we hope to bring the playa-experience to everyone. Akin to how a kaleidoscope uses a triangle of three mirrors to create an entrancing image, MirrorrorriM: The Alchemy of Play utilizes a triangle of Art, Play, and Interactivity to create a whole-body experience.</p>
</div></div>","MirrorrorriM: The Alchemy of Play
MirrorrorriM is an art project being pioneered by a group of artists who have come together to create a giant, transportable kaleidoscope that is completely participant operated. This 30' long kaleidoscope is clad in wood and spins in-place on a series of caster wheels. At one end is a viewing chamber for folks to enjoy the show, and on the other end is our own version of the ""object chamber"" where you might find small beads or glass in a regular kaleidoscope, but not MirrorrorriM. Our object chamber is a giant wheel that participants strap their feet into and spin to create a pattern with their body, while behind them a fire wheel adds light and chaos (oh, and some heat). The whole kaleidoscope is participant-operated: it spins when several people work together to push it, and the psychedelic images are created by a real person's body turning in front of a fire wheel. Sound awesome? Read on!   
The aim of this campaign is to get enough funding to get our project rolling! As a team, we are completely dedicated to the project and have been putting much love (and money!) into it. With your help we can take our project not only to Burning Man 2016 but also the road to be appreciated everywhere. The intention behind this project is to take it as many places as possible, so everyone can experience transformative, large-scale, interactive, community-driven art.  We have plans to take it to community events, have it installed at art galleries, and take it to schools! MirrorrorriM can be altered depending on the event: we can remove the fire element if it is not desired or we can add additional colour wheels (think Rainbows for Pride or Red and White for Canada Day!).
So, How Much Money do We Need? 
We've budgeted our project to be about $30,000 and we are hoping the raise half of that with this campaign. If we do not reach the goal of our campaign, the funds will still go directly into the project and we will explore new funding avenues. 
What's The $$ For?
Materials: Polycarbonate mirrors, wood siding, copper tubing, wheels, lasers (LASERS!), etc. 
Transportation: The usual fuel costs AND a 40' trailer to build it on so that we can roll into any city and be instantly ready to delight!
Perks For You!
We've got some really amazing perks. We've got t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, and bandannas. We also have some handmade kaleidoscopes and some CNC'd artwork for you to enjoy any time! And there's a chance that we could bring the project to your birthday party (if you live on the west coast of North America). **

After a wildly successful 8,000 mile road trip in 2013 visiting
women's safe houses and shelters, the Women’s Wisdom Initiative's Shelter to Shelter  program is ready to hit

This
August Caroline & Juliette will pack up art supplies, take to the road and bring the Traveling Postcards Workshop to refugee support centers whose women’s empowerment programs would

The Impact


How does art help?


Helping women to reconnect to their hearts and to find the strength to speak their truth is where healing and transformation can occur, and is the central focus of our work. We find the creative arts to be an invaluable tool in this process. 

Self-confidence and pride: Each woman is asked to share her voice, her innate wisdom and her resiliency when she makes a postcard; her expression will not only serve as a gift for another survivor, but she will share her voice with a global community of women worldwide. She will be seen and valued.

Freedom: Allowing each workshop participant to be the creator and the decision maker increases her sense of belonging and responsibility. Each time she has the option to choose a shape or color and decide where to place it on her card, she is empowered.

Empowerment: Through simple transformative art-making processes we have discovered that we can easily share what might seem impossible to verbalize and our voices can then become a powerful catalyst for change.







Our creative and global workshop has created over 2500 cards that have been sent among women around the world in over nine countries.


Traveling Postcards creates a non-threatening opportunity for personal connection to humanitarian issues that may seem overwhelming or geographically separate from our own lives. By providing personal connection, we create the possibility for every individual to become socially active in her community in a way that utilizes her best self.

We are currently collecting Traveling Postcards to take with us to give away as a gift of solidarity and support. If you would like to send one on our trip please click here for directions!
There is remarkable power in a woman coming to understand that her abuse is not normal and that, in spite of the violence, she is a survivor and deserves equality and justice. 

Don't forget to spread the word and make some noise about our campaign!

Thank you for your support! More info: http://sheltertoshelter.org/ and at http://womenswisdominitiative.org/.  
""Where, after all, do human rights begin? In small places, close to home — so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Such are the places where every man, woman and child seek equal opportunity, equal dignity, without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere."" ~Eleanor Roosevelt",5.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>THE BIG BABY VIKING - ART PROJECT @ AFRIKABURN 2017</strong></p>
<p>This year we are bringing our baby to come and play at AfrikaBurn 2017. This little baby is entirely made of wood and will be around 6 meters tall. A projection will give our baby a face with moving mouth and his eyes will follow the crowd. Speakers are attached so the baby (or you) can say whatever inappropriate things need to be said at night. For all these nightly disturbances our baby has to burn on Sunday evening! Yes! He shall be burned on our last evening in the desert, combined with some dusty blues on the piano. </p>
<p>Around 60% of the costs are covered and funded by camp Walhalla but we are looking to fund the last 40%. So please help us to get this baby playing at AfrikaBurn 2017!</p>

<p><strong>WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING AT WALHALLA?</strong></p>
<p>What do they serve in heaven?! Yup! Walhalla Beers and Bears! </p>
<p>The teddy bears are on their way to the townships to make many little children happy as a flying unicorn. But first they will come to Walhalla to bring some fluffy love and cover all your cuttle needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore relax and play some funky blues on our Piano and get dressed at the Funky Boutique. Later in the evening please hit the DIY Party Button for a 5 min Poco-Loco-Party! </p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>Walhalla theme camp is a mixed group of around 40 people. Most of us are from The Netherlands but we also have other nationalities joining us. Some are virgin burners and some have been going to BurningMan and AfrikaBurn for over a decade.</p>
<p>Our team captain Ronald Duikersloot is a professional artists based in the Netherlands who works on all kinds of (international) projects. His work and shows can be seen at festivals and events and his free work is to be found in exhibitions and gallery’s.

<p><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong></p>
<p>Every euro, dollar and rand donated will be spent on our little baby. Most of it will be for materials like wood, electronics, etc but also for the transport to Tankwa Karoo. </p>

 9. Storia di UAM e precedenti mostreVisto il successo virale del progetto, Umani a Milano si è costituito in un’associazione senza finalità di lucro, che nello statuto ha, come finalità: “ (…) promuovere e diffondere la cultura del rispetto del territorio e dei diritti della persona. A tal scopo si attiva per raccogliere e promuovere storie personali di persone incontrate sul territorio di Milano e organizzare dibattiti, incontri e performance con la popolazione, iniziative di formazione e informazione pubblica.”Precedenti mostre ed iniziative sul territorioUmani a Milano è uscito dal web molto presto per confrontarsi con la realtà che rappresenta. Lo fa con mostre, installazioni e iniziative autofinanziate, in sedi e di concerto con partner e soggetti più vari.Dal 16 Settembre 2015 al 10 Gennaio 2016 la grande mostra nello spazio pubblico della nuova Darsena di Milano, con il patrocinio del Comune di Milano, il supporto del nostri sostenitori attraverso la campagna di #crowdfunding e la sponsorizzazione di Levi's
Il 27 maggio 2014 UAM presenta un’installazione presso l’Università Commerciale Bocconi, nell’ingresso della nuova sede di via Roetgen. 

Il 22 giugno 2014 UAM ha mostrato le storie che sta raccogliendo a Niguarda, presso il Circolo culturale Cromotaranta, in collaborazione con il Consiglio di Zona 9 e l’Ufficio Iniziative e Rapporti con Associazioni Giovanili del Comune di Milano. 

Tutto comincia nel gennaio 2014 con la mostra di UAM presso il Santeria, spazio espositivo in zona Lambrate. L’evento ha successo e occupa una pagina del Corriere della Sera attirando ulteriori e diverse attenzioni.

a town where <b>there are no official institutes for formal education in arts</b>,
we have developed <b>a network for creative learning</b>; bringing artists

</div></div>","What is BORDES? / ¿Qué es BORDES?

We
are a very diverse group of people who believe in art and culture as means to
develop a plural society. 
BORDES is a nonprofit organization located in San Cristóbal, a small city, on the Venezuelan border with Colombia, in the north of South America.  BORDES is also the name of our annual gathering: festival/conference. 
Somos un diverso grupo de personas quienes creemos en la cultura y el arte como medio para construir una sociedad más plural. 
BORDES es  una organización sin fines de lucro que funciona en San Cristóbal, una pequeña ciudad en la frontera venezolana con Colombia, en el norte de Suramérica. BORDES también es el nombre de nuestro encuentro anual, un festival/seminario en torno a las artes y estudios culturales.



Our goal: cultivating arts and
humanities, in an indifferent or sometimes downright hostile environment, where
everyone speaks only of violence and economic crisis.


Nuestra meta: cultivar las artes y humanidades, en un ambiente indiferente o a veces hostil, donde solo se habla de violencia y de crisis económica.




Art,
humanities and creativity promotion may not be heroic, but we believe that
these small and constant activities result in valuable outcomes that contribute
significantly towards social change, daily building the country and the world
that we want and we know is possible. While others promise salvation of the
country through political or economic measures, we continue working, nonstop,
because we believe in what we do and it is the top priority for us. 
El arte, las humanidades y la promoción cultural puede que no sean heroicas, pero creemos que estas actividades constantes tienen un resultado valioso, y que contribuimos significativamente con el cambio social, construyendo cotidianamente la región y el país que queremos. Mientras otros prometen salvar al país a través de medidas políticas o económicas, nosotros seguimos trabajando sin parar, porque creemos en lo que hacemos y para nosotros es prioridad. 


In
a town where there are no official institutes for formal education in arts,
we have developed a network for creative learning; bringing artists
and scholars, organizing workshops, conferences, seminars, where
artists share their experience with the community. Collaborative
projects have arisen from these encounters, with individuals and
groups who work in other parts of the country or the world. We are
never the same after these exchanges, which deeply enrich
our lives. We want other people to live what we are experiencing;
these continued transforming opportunities. 
En un lugar donde no tenemos
institutos formales de educación en arte, nosotros hemos construido
una red de formación, traemos talleristas, grandes artistas y otros
estudiantes y aficionados, a compartir con nosotros sus experiencias.
Hemos realizado a partir de estos encuentros proyectos conjuntos, con
personas dentro y fuera del país. Y no somos los mismos después de
haber vivido estos intercambios que nos enriquecen. Queremos que
otras personas sigan teniendo esta oportunidad de
transformación.


 


Why support us? / ¿Por
qué apoyar este proyecto?


BORDES
is in danger of extinction.
Previous editions of the BORDES Conference have been accomplished with small financial backing but huge efforts. It has been hard to do, but not impossible.
Now,
Venezuela´s economic crisis is playing against us, and for the
first time we are facing the risk of letting this event disappear.
BORDES está en peligro de extinción. 
En las ediciones anteriores del Seminario hemos logrado realizar un evento de esta magnitud con mucho esfuerzo y poco dinero. Era difícil hacerlo, pero no imposible.
Ahora la situación económica de Venezuela juega en contra de nosotros y por primera vez sentimos que corremos el riesgo de que este evento desaparezca.





Many
people haven't heard of it, but for us, it is important that this
project survives and makes it through not only by seven, but many more editions. We want other people, like us, to fall in love with this
project and what it stands for in our community.
Muchas
personas no lo conocen, pero para nosotros es importante que
sobreviva y se mantenga no solo por siete sino por muchos años más.
Queremos que otras personas, al igual que nosotros, se enamoren de
este proyecto y de lo que representa para nuestra comunidad.

For us, giving up is not an option; this is why we come to you, asking for help, to keep giving opportunities to people who may learn to see beyond crisis and difficulties, and begin to enjoy and learn through art.
Para nosotros, rendirse no es opción; es por eso que acudimos a ustedes para que nos ayuden a seguir dándole una oportunidad a las personas de ver más allá de las dificultades y puedan disfrutar y aprender a través del arte.


Where does the money go? / ¿A dónde va el dinero?
 



The
organization of an international festival where we host conferences,
workshops and different artistic presentations, is very expensive.
La organización de un evento internacional donde tenemos conferencias, talleres y presentaciones artísticas de distintas disciplinas, conlleva muchos gastos.


Since we started this project in 2010, we have always prided ourselves in giving a warm greeting to every guest and attendant. We work to provide food and housing for four days, for approximately 500 people (growing every time). 
Technical assistance includes: 


Sound amplification
Illumination 
Scenography
Paint, strings, nails, glue, etc. 
Video projectors for cinema, video art presentations and lectures.

Creating an artistic catalog, posters and other design material is part of the job.


Desde que empezamos este proyecto en 2010 nos hemos caracterizado por brindarle una cálida atención a todos nuestros invitados y a los participantes. Nos preocupamos por ofrecerles hidratación, alimentación e incluso hospedaje durante cuatro días; todo esto para una cantidad de aproximadamente 500 personas que sigue aumentando cada año. 
La asistencia técnica adecuada incluye: 


Equipos de amplificación de sonido 
Iluminación 
Escenografía para los artistas escénicos 
Pintura, clavos, hilo, madera
Se requieren muchos proyectores y reproductores de video para  cine y video arte, para las conferencias.

El diseño de un catálogo artístico, afiches y otros materiales gráficos es parte de un buen trabajo.

<p>Unfortunately, the festival does not have funds to support the artists presentations.

<p>Projected abstract images, controlled with hand gestures, dance to original music. Advanced technology makes it easy for audience members of all ages and ability levels to create a new version of the visual work, inspired by their own imagination.</p>
<p>Bandwidth is a projection art exhibit displayed on three surfaces -- at the Lumens festival the projections may be as large as the side of a building for outside audiences. The audio component may be reproduced in stereo with a subwoofer if funds are available.</p>
<p>The exhibit blurs the lines of definition between installation, video game and performance as three visual components are each controlled by gesture. One element on each screen automatically dances to specific frequencies in the music, but one element per screen must be user controlled. This makes for an excellent audience participation work as 3 participants per performance are invited to control the size, shape or movement of one of the visual elements to create a unique performance.</p>
<p>As an Integrated Media Artist, with core training as a composer and performer of music, Victoria Gibson created the music and the visual accompaniment. An experienced facilitator, she encourages individuals to work in “Practice mode” to become comfortable with the interaction. Then she starts the music to begin the performance.</p>
<p>Bandwidth was shown in 2010 as a work-in-progress at EMPAC Center, Troy,NY and premiered as part of the Nuit Blanche, 2011 Guelph Jazz Festival, Ontario, Canada. It would be wonderful to share this interactive installation with the people of NY on Staten Island on June 23rd, 2012.</p>

""When Bankers get together for dinner they discuss Art. When artists get together for dinner, they discuss money"" - Oscar Wilde 
November 2009 I destroyed my most recent project (Checkpoint Dreamyourtopia - a border control checkpoint to enter your own Dreams) with chainsaws and sledgehammers in an old swimming pool in Berlin. That day we tore down the walls between Dreams and Reality, exactly twenty years after the Berlin Wall came down. As always, a new Dream is only a Reality away and the Exchanghibition Bank will be the first step in realizing a new Dream!
Do you remember the image of Scrooge Duck diving into his money? Wealth and material accumulation once provided a happy image to children around the world, but have become increasingly dystopian and suspicious
in recent times. Financial crisis has removed the pot of gold awaiting us at
the end of the rainbow.  Even though the fantasy of riches has gotten ever more distasteful, can you still resist a swim in a pool filled with money?                     


And
that will be my new art project: a pool filled with millions of money
bills, bundled in stacks. A closer look at the pool will reveal that the bills in the pool are not real money, but pieces of aesthetically pleasing art. During today's financial crisis, art has been frequently cited as an advantageous alternative asset class and diamond encrusted skulls and Picasso's go for over one hundred million. As the participants will strip down to enter in a pool of artful riches, they'll realize it's strictly forbidden and enforced by security guards to take even one bill back home. 
The
pool itself will be built at the Burning Man festival in Nevada. That festival
is a temporary city (Black Rock City), built in the Nevada desert, based on a gift-economy. In Black Rock City, a city that functions without money, a Fort Knox like vault will hopefully challenge the assumptions and relationships participants have with money, and art.
No real bank will finance this project, so I'll start my own bank; the Exchanghibition Bank, which will hopefully help this dream come true. The Bank itself will be a specially designed exchange booth and will travel to different places. People can buy or rather exchange their money for the specially designed art bills  and a bill with denomination zero might become worth more than a bill 
with a value of a hundred thousand. This way we can start raising some money to fill the pool and at the same time establish an exchange rate for the bills.  This exchange rate will eventually also result in a very interesting total value for all the bills in the pool project, which might propel the installation itself into the multi-million dollar elite league of art. Which means it's a great work of art, right?And of course this bank won't get a bailout from the Government, so we need you!Let's swim in our fantasy while others drown in their reality ! The Money raised with this campaign will make sure the bank booth can be built, banker costumes can be made and money/art bills can be printed, and , NO, no money left over will disappear in greedy bankers' pockets, but will be used to start filling up the pool!Building a huge interactive project in the Nevada desert as an artist from Amsterdam will provide more than the usual challenges.

Let's make the last day an awesome one, and hit the big $10,000! Many thanks to everyone who backs this campaign :D</div><div>
<b>Stretch Goal Updates!</b><br/>
</div><div>May 14, 2015 - WOOHOO!!! We hit $9000 last night! <b>THANK YOU!!!! </b>That means I will be offering a free Livestream class to campaign backers after the deck and book have been sent out. Now--let's see if we can get to $12,000 and get that audio book stretch goal unlocked!</div><div>
<br/><p>April 20, 2015 - Hey, all! So we hit $7,000 (actually $7,030) this morning on the official Tarot of Bones IndieGoGo campaign, <b>just two weeks after it went live</b>--woohoo, and THANK YOU!!!!!! This means that we're now over 140% funded, AND we've reached the first stretch goal, and I will be adding a Happy Squirrel card to the official Tarot of Bones deck. </p>
<p>I'd also like to announce the next two stretch goals:</p>
<p><strong>If this IndieGoGo campaign reaches $9,000 before it ends, once the Tarot of Bones deck and book are out, I will offer a free Livestream class on how to use the Tarot of Bones exclusively for IndieGoGo backers.</strong> For those who can't make it, I will email the video to you afterward, and I will wait a month before I put it up on YouTube for everyone to see. This will happen in the latter half of 2016 (unless for some unknown reason I have to release the deck and book later than Summer 2016). </p>
<p><strong>And if the campaign reaches $12,000 before it ends, I will record an audiobook version of the Tarot of Bones book!</strong> This will be useful not just for people who are better audio learners than readers, but also for people who may have limited vision. I will be recording it at home, so this will not be a pro-level audiobook, but I promise to do the very best that I can with freeware like Audacity. I plan for the audiobook to be released within a year as both a downloadable file and a CD after the hardcopy deck and book are out. All IndieGoGo backers will get the file version of the audiobook for free.</p>
</div><div>13 April , 2015 - Can you believe it?

<p></p>
<div>My name is Lupa; I am an author, artist and amateur naturalist living in Portland, OR. I have been pagan since 1996, and started reading tarot and other divination systems shortly thereafter. In 1998 I began incorporating animal hides and bones and other natural items in my artwork and spirituality, and caring for these sacred remains became central to my life. I've written several books on nature spirituality, among them <i><a href=""http://www.thegreenwolf.com/books/skin-spirits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Use of Animal Parts</a> </i>(Megalithica Books, 2010) and <i><a href=""http://www.thegreenwolf.com/books/plant-and-fungus-totems/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Plant and Fungus Totems: Connect With Spirits of Field, Forest and Garden</a></i> (Llewellyn, 2015). I have been self-employed full-time since 2011 and am the breadwinner of my household, though I make time to go visit my beloved Oregon wilderness which inspires so many of my works.</div>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Now I'm bringing together the threads of my creative career in an ambitious project: <b>The Tarot of Bones</b>. This deck and book set combines the nature-inspired symbolism of animal bones with the tarot's well-loved archetypes to create an unparalleled divination set for the 21st century. For each of the 78 cards I am creating permanent assemblage artworks featuring carefully chosen and legally acquired animal bones and other natural materials reflecting the cards' messages. High-quality photos of these pieces will be used for the card art. The full-length companion book, available both in paperback and ebook form, will explore the symbolism of the cards in detail and my inspiration in creating each.</span></p>
</div>
<p>While I have been professionally published multiple times over, this is an intensely personal project, and I have opted to self-publish the Tarot of Bones. My goal is to have all 78 assemblage pieces completed by the end of 2015, and to publish the deck and book in Summer 2016. I've already made a lot of progress and acquired many of the materials I need to keep going, You can help me achieve my goals with this project by backing me here on IndieGoGo!</p>

The photos shown on this campaign are just to show the work; the photos used for the prints will be the same ones used for the final card art, and therefore the prints will be printed at the same time as the cards so all can be delivered at once in Summer 2016.</span><br/></p>

<br/>
<p><b>Leather Pouch:</b> Leather pouches were one of the first projects I learned to make when I initially started working with hides and bones. You can choose to claim a deck with a leather pouch made just the right size for it. US folks will get one made of deerskin; international folks will get cowhide due to customs restrictions. Pouches will be shipped when the decks are shipped in Summer 2016.</p>

<p><b>Original Tarot of Bones Assemblage Piece:</b> There are three different options for people in the U.S. who want to buy one of the original assemblage pieces used in making the Tarot of Bones. There is an additional option for international buyers to get one of a very limited number of the assemblage pieces that do not include wildlife or plant parts and can therefore be sent out of the U.S. While <b>I will ultimately choose who gets which piece</b>, you are welcome to contact me with your five favorites at the end of 2016 once all the assemblages are completed. Also, as I will be displaying some of these originals at galleries and other art venues in the latter half of 2016, they will not be delivered to their new homes until sometime in 2017. (You will get your deck and book set plus the three prints in Summer 2016.)</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The Tarot of Bones is a very resource-intensive project, both in terms of materials and time invested. </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To date I have already put around $1500 of my own money </b><span style="""">into the skulls, bones and other materials for the 78 permanent assemblage pieces, and will continue to invest funds into materials, printing, shipping and related costs. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">While the money I've already spent has covered a significant amount of what I'll need, I still need to purchase more materials in order to complete the assemblages. The skulls (and in some cases high-quality, handmade skull replicas) are the most expensive components. Most of them are high-quality collectibles, many cannot be found secondhand except on very rare occasion, and some are quite expensive even at wholesale prices. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I've mitigated the costs some by making most of the other materials secondhand, haunting thrift stores and yard sales in Portland and beyond for old cutting boards, half-full tubes of acrylic paint and other salvaged art supplies. I collect a lot of the plant material and other natural materials myself, to include when walking around my Portland neighborhood. I am seeking secondhand skulls and bones from private collections when I'm able, and when I do buy new I often buy directly from the individuals and small businesses who reclaim and clean these bones. However, I'm still making almost eighty individual assemblage pieces--that's a lot of art supplies to bring home!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a flexible-funding campaign, which means that if I do not meet my goal, I still get the money (but IndieGoGo gets to keep a much larger percentage of it, 9% as opposed to 4%, not including Paypal's fees on top of that). <b>Even if I don't raise $5,000, I will continue with the project with the goal of having the deck and book released summer 2016</b>; the successful completion of this campaign will make that much easier. Here's where your contributions will go:</p>
<p>If I raise <b>$2,500</b>, after fees I will be able to purchase the most expensive skulls (real and replica) I still need to obtain. Some of these cost a few hundred dollars, a significant amount of money for me to spend at once. I can get these pricier skulls into my studio and breathe a little more easily about the costs.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If I raise <b>$3,500</b>, after fees I'll be able to buy all the remaining materials I need for the assemblage pieces, which will help me <a href=""http://www.thetarotofbones.com/production-schedule/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stick to my production schedule</a> and possibly beat my deadlines since I'll already have everything I need to make the magic happen! </span><br/></p>
<p>My primary goal of <b>$5,000</b>, after fees,will allow me to purchase the rest of the materials I need. It will also help me to fund other costs for this project, ranging from printing and shipping costs for the deck and book, prints and other perks, and compensating myself for time spent collecting materials, taking photos, writing the book manuscript and online updates, and other time invested in this project. <b>While the IndieGoGo campaign is not my sole source of funding for this project, it will allow me to divert a lot less money from my everyday income and help me compensate for the time that I spent working on the Tarot of Bones.</b> In short, by backing this campaign you'll be keeping a roof over my head while I dedicate myself to this great work.</p>

To that end, I've laid out a timeline for production of the Tarot of Bones:<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>End of 2015</b> – Deadline for completing all 78 assemblage pieces for the Tarot of Bones. I will be working steadily on these throughout 2015; I have to complete 6 1/2 pieces per month to meet this deadline, and I’m going to try to get out ahead of that, particular once festival season starts in summer.</p>
<p><b>January 2016</b> – Send the Tarot of Bones book to an independent editor (I will be self-publishing the book); it will likely go through multiple editing sessions throughout spring.</p>
<p><b>January – April 2016</b> – final photographs of art pieces for card art; final card designs</p>
<p><b>May-June 2016 </b>– Have proofs of the 78 cards and the book ready to send to the printers for approval</p>
<p><b>June-July 2016</b> – Publication and release of the first printing of the Tarot of Bones deck and book</p>
<p>I started making assemblage pieces in mid-January. <b>As of April 7, 2015 I have already completed 20 of the 78 assemblage pieces.</b> When I finish creating an assemblage, I write about it in the manuscript for the Tarot of Bones companion book, which is already over 8,000 words long. So in just four months I've made a tremendous amount of progress. Additionally, as I am 100% self-employed I have more time and schedule flexibility than many creative folks, and I've been able to leverage that well so far. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Time is the scarcest commodity. In addition to working on the Tarot of Bones, I am currently in the editing process for my next book with Llewellyn Worldwide, </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Nature Spirituality From the Ground Up: Connect With Totems in Your Ecosystem</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, due out January 2016, and putting details on another manuscript as of yet unclaimed by any publisher. I vend my art and books at several events throughout the Pacific Northwest and am constantly looking for art shows and galleries to submit my assemblage work to. I maintain two blogs, a very busy Etsy shop, and a healthy social media presence. And I try to go hiking once a week to maintain my sanity.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style="""">All that being said,</span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> this is not a case of <i>if</i> the Tarot of Bones will happen, but <i>when</i>. </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Barring my unlikely disability or demise, it will happen even if I have to pay more out of pocket for the expenses, and even if it comes out later than anticipated.

<br/>
<p>The Tarot of Bones is born out of a creative career spanning nearly two decades, embracing both writing and art, and challenging me to excellence not only in familiar media but in new skills as well. At the end of it, I will be able to offer others a valuable tool in divination as well as a beautiful work of art. </p>Moreover, it's a reminder that we are still a part of the natural world. I chose bones as the primary material for this project because throughout the entirety of the body of a vertebrate animal–human included–the bones are the strongest portions. They provide a scaffolding on which the rest of the animal is built, and they remain long after flesh and sinew have gone away. Likewise, although generations of people come and go, the desire to connect to something greater than one’s self and to engage one’s intuition endures. Through bones we can speak with our evolutionary ancestors; through divination we create patterns that help us make sense of the world around us–and the worlds within.</div>

</div></div>","May 19, 2015 - We're down to the last few hours of this campaign, and we're SO CLOSE to having it 200% funded--my mind is STILL spinning from how quickly we hit 100% just four days after it started. Let's make the last day an awesome one, and hit the big $10,000! Many thanks to everyone who backs this campaign :D
Stretch Goal Updates!
May 14, 2015 - WOOHOO!!! We hit $9000 last night! THANK YOU!!!! That means I will be offering a free Livestream class to campaign backers after the deck and book have been sent out. Now--let's see if we can get to $12,000 and get that audio book stretch goal unlocked!
April 20, 2015 - Hey, all! So we hit $7,000 (actually $7,030) this morning on the official Tarot of Bones IndieGoGo campaign, just two weeks after it went live--woohoo, and THANK YOU!!!!!! This means that we're now over 140% funded, AND we've reached the first stretch goal, and I will be adding a Happy Squirrel card to the official Tarot of Bones deck. 
I'd also like to announce the next two stretch goals:
If this IndieGoGo campaign reaches $9,000 before it ends, once the Tarot of Bones deck and book are out, I will offer a free Livestream class on how to use the Tarot of Bones exclusively for IndieGoGo backers. For those who can't make it, I will email the video to you afterward, and I will wait a month before I put it up on YouTube for everyone to see. This will happen in the latter half of 2016 (unless for some unknown reason I have to release the deck and book later than Summer 2016). 
And if the campaign reaches $12,000 before it ends, I will record an audiobook version of the Tarot of Bones book! This will be useful not just for people who are better audio learners than readers, but also for people who may have limited vision. I will be recording it at home, so this will not be a pro-level audiobook, but I promise to do the very best that I can with freeware like Audacity. I plan for the audiobook to be released within a year as both a downloadable file and a CD after the hardcopy deck and book are out. All IndieGoGo backers will get the file version of the audiobook for free.
13 April , 2015 - Can you believe it? We funded this thing in its first 100 hours!   Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who chipped in, whether by backing the campaign or spreading the word or being moral support through this crazy week. So now that we've got our first $5,000 (and change) what's next? This:
Allow me to announce our first stretch goal: If the Tarot of Bones IndieGoGo campaign gets to $7000 before it ends, I will add a Happy Squirrel card to the official Tarot of Bones deck and book. What's the Happy Squirrel card? It's something of an in-joke among tarot fans, stemming from a 1995 episode of The Simpsons. Here's more of an explanation.

The $5000 already covers my materials for the assemblages, with a little left over to put toward printing/shipping, perk fulfillment and other administrative costsIf we get to $7000, I will have more administrative funding, and I'll make a Happy Squirrel assemblage piece to be included as the 79th card in the deck. We're already at a little over $5700--let's see how fast you can make me have to come up with the next stretch goal!

 

Bringing the Tarot of Bones to Life!

My name is Lupa; I am an author, artist and amateur naturalist living in Portland, OR. I have been pagan since 1996, and started reading tarot and other divination systems shortly thereafter. In 1998 I began incorporating animal hides and bones and other natural items in my artwork and spirituality, and caring for these sacred remains became central to my life. I've written several books on nature spirituality, among them Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Use of Animal Parts (Megalithica Books, 2010) and Plant and Fungus Totems: Connect With Spirits of Field, Forest and Garden (Llewellyn, 2015). I have been self-employed full-time since 2011 and am the breadwinner of my household, though I make time to go visit my beloved Oregon wilderness which inspires so many of my works.



(Note - this is a mockup; final card may look different.)

Now I'm bringing together the threads of my creative career in an ambitious project: The Tarot of Bones. This deck and book set combines the nature-inspired symbolism of animal bones with the tarot's well-loved archetypes to create an unparalleled divination set for the 21st century. For each of the 78 cards I am creating permanent assemblage artworks featuring carefully chosen and legally acquired animal bones and other natural materials reflecting the cards' messages. High-quality photos of these pieces will be used for the card art. The full-length companion book, available both in paperback and ebook form, will explore the symbolism of the cards in detail and my inspiration in creating each.

While I have been professionally published multiple times over, this is an intensely personal project, and I have opted to self-publish the Tarot of Bones. My goal is to have all 78 assemblage pieces completed by the end of 2015, and to publish the deck and book in Summer 2016. I've already made a lot of progress and acquired many of the materials I need to keep going, You can help me achieve my goals with this project by backing me here on IndieGoGo!
Get the Deck, Book, and More!

 So what sorts of goodies can you get by backing this campaign? Here are a few possibilities for you to choose from:



The Tarot of Bones Deck (with the companion paperback or ebook)


Prints of select cards, approximately 8"" x 10"" in size


A hand-sewn (by me!) leather bag to keep your deck in


Original assemblage pieces used in the making of the Tarot of Bones


A one of a kind, custom-made assemblage piece made to your specifications


Copies of my other books, your choice of which one(s)


A special thank you in the Tarot of Bones companion book and on the official website


If you can't decide which one you reallllly want, keep in mind you can claim multiple perks by making bigger and/or multiple contributions--more information here.
Also, please remember that perk amounts include my costs for materials for fulfilling and shipping them, and also account for IndieGoGo and Paypal taking out their fees!
Now for a little more detail on some of these perks:



Prints: I'll be creating prints of three of my favorite cards to date: Justice (above), Magician (the piece shown in the mock-up card above) and the Ace of Pentacles (shown under the Timelines, Risks and Challenges heading below); you'll get your pick of one of these, or a collection of all three. The photos shown on this campaign are just to show the work; the photos used for the prints will be the same ones used for the final card art, and therefore the prints will be printed at the same time as the cards so all can be delivered at once in Summer 2016.



Leather Pouch: Leather pouches were one of the first projects I learned to make when I initially started working with hides and bones. You can choose to claim a deck with a leather pouch made just the right size for it. US folks will get one made of deerskin; international folks will get cowhide due to customs restrictions. Pouches will be shipped when the decks are shipped in Summer 2016.



Original Tarot of Bones Assemblage Piece: There are three different options for people in the U.S. who want to buy one of the original assemblage pieces used in making the Tarot of Bones. There is an additional option for international buyers to get one of a very limited number of the assemblage pieces that do not include wildlife or plant parts and can therefore be sent out of the U.S. While I will ultimately choose who gets which piece, you are welcome to contact me with your five favorites at the end of 2016 once all the assemblages are completed. Also, as I will be displaying some of these originals at galleries and other art venues in the latter half of 2016, they will not be delivered to their new homes until sometime in 2017. (You will get your deck and book set plus the three prints in Summer 2016.)



Note: This is not one of the assemblages for the Tarot of Bones. It's Flora et Fauna II, a piece I did in 2014.
Custom Assemblage Piece: A very limited number of backers can opt to get a custom assemblage piece made by me, in addition to one of the originals from the Tarot of Bones. You can look at my portfolio to get some idea of the work that I do. Please keep in mind that the laws governing your location may limit the materials I'm allowed to work with for your piece; some substitutions, such as resin skulls, may be available. (You will get your deck and book set plus the three prints in Summer 2016.)


Books: I've written and published several books prior to this project. You can choose to bring home one or more of these titles, shipped along with your Tarot of Bones set in Summer 2016:
Fang and Fur, Blood and Bone: A Primal Guide to Animal Magic
DIY Totemism: Your Personal Guide to Animal Totems
Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Uses of Animal Parts
New Paths to Animal Totems: Three Alternative Approaches to Creating Your Own Totemism
Plant and Fungus Totems: Connect With Spirits of Field, Forest and Garden
And you can even preorder my next book, due out January 2016 from Llewellyn Worldwide (your copy will be shipped with your Tarot of Bones set in Summer 2016):
Nature Spirituality From the Ground Up: Connect With Totems in Your Bioregion
Please note that my anthologies are not included in this special offer. 
$howing You the Money

 


The Tarot of Bones is a very resource-intensive project, both in terms of materials and time invested. To date I have already put around $1500 of my own money into the skulls, bones and other materials for the 78 permanent assemblage pieces, and will continue to invest funds into materials, printing, shipping and related costs. 

While the money I've already spent has covered a significant amount of what I'll need, I still need to purchase more materials in order to complete the assemblages. The skulls (and in some cases high-quality, handmade skull replicas) are the most expensive components. Most of them are high-quality collectibles, many cannot be found secondhand except on very rare occasion, and some are quite expensive even at wholesale prices. 
I've mitigated the costs some by making most of the other materials secondhand, haunting thrift stores and yard sales in Portland and beyond for old cutting boards, half-full tubes of acrylic paint and other salvaged art supplies. I collect a lot of the plant material and other natural materials myself, to include when walking around my Portland neighborhood. I am seeking secondhand skulls and bones from private collections when I'm able, and when I do buy new I often buy directly from the individuals and small businesses who reclaim and clean these bones. However, I'm still making almost eighty individual assemblage pieces--that's a lot of art supplies to bring home!

This is a flexible-funding campaign, which means that if I do not meet my goal, I still get the money (but IndieGoGo gets to keep a much larger percentage of it, 9% as opposed to 4%, not including Paypal's fees on top of that). Even if I don't raise $5,000, I will continue with the project with the goal of having the deck and book released summer 2016; the successful completion of this campaign will make that much easier. Here's where your contributions will go:
If I raise $2,500, after fees I will be able to purchase the most expensive skulls (real and replica) I still need to obtain. Some of these cost a few hundred dollars, a significant amount of money for me to spend at once. I can get these pricier skulls into my studio and breathe a little more easily about the costs.
If I raise $3,500, after fees I'll be able to buy all the remaining materials I need for the assemblage pieces, which will help me stick to my production schedule and possibly beat my deadlines since I'll already have everything I need to make the magic happen! 
My primary goal of $5,000, after fees,will allow me to purchase the rest of the materials I need. It will also help me to fund other costs for this project, ranging from printing and shipping costs for the deck and book, prints and other perks, and compensating myself for time spent collecting materials, taking photos, writing the book manuscript and online updates, and other time invested in this project. While the IndieGoGo campaign is not my sole source of funding for this project, it will allow me to divert a lot less money from my everyday income and help me compensate for the time that I spent working on the Tarot of Bones. In short, by backing this campaign you'll be keeping a roof over my head while I dedicate myself to this great work.



While the majority of costs will go to the production of the set, I will be donating a to-be-decided portion of the proceeds to nonprofit organizations that benefit wildlife and their habitats. I am already a regular contributor to several of these organizations, Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and the Nature Conservancy, including making monthly donations to a select few. While the exact amount I give varies from month to month depending on my income and expenses, I do what I can to help these organizations keep up their good work. 
Timeline, Risks and Challenges

 


I've published several books and run a yearly arts festival in Portland (Curious Gallery), so I am well acquainted with deadlines and the importance of meeting them. To that end, I've laid out a timeline for production of the Tarot of Bones:



End of 2015 – Deadline for completing all 78 assemblage pieces for the Tarot of Bones. I will be working steadily on these throughout 2015; I have to complete 6 1/2 pieces per month to meet this deadline, and I’m going to try to get out ahead of that, particular once festival season starts in summer.
January 2016 – Send the Tarot of Bones book to an independent editor (I will be self-publishing the book); it will likely go through multiple editing sessions throughout spring.
January – April 2016 – final photographs of art pieces for card art; final card designs
May-June 2016 – Have proofs of the 78 cards and the book ready to send to the printers for approval
June-July 2016 – Publication and release of the first printing of the Tarot of Bones deck and book
I started making assemblage pieces in mid-January. As of April 7, 2015 I have already completed 20 of the 78 assemblage pieces. When I finish creating an assemblage, I write about it in the manuscript for the Tarot of Bones companion book, which is already over 8,000 words long. So in just four months I've made a tremendous amount of progress. Additionally, as I am 100% self-employed I have more time and schedule flexibility than many creative folks, and I've been able to leverage that well so far. 
Time is the scarcest commodity. In addition to working on the Tarot of Bones, I am currently in the editing process for my next book with Llewellyn Worldwide, Nature Spirituality From the Ground Up: Connect With Totems in Your Ecosystem, due out January 2016, and putting details on another manuscript as of yet unclaimed by any publisher. I vend my art and books at several events throughout the Pacific Northwest and am constantly looking for art shows and galleries to submit my assemblage work to. I maintain two blogs, a very busy Etsy shop, and a healthy social media presence. And I try to go hiking once a week to maintain my sanity.
All that being said, this is not a case of if the Tarot of Bones will happen, but when. Barring my unlikely disability or demise, it will happen even if I have to pay more out of pocket for the expenses, and even if it comes out later than anticipated. Your backing will help me stay on schedule, and is greatly appreciated!
    Why Is This Important? 



The Tarot of Bones is born out of a creative career spanning nearly two decades, embracing both writing and art, and challenging me to excellence not only in familiar media but in new skills as well. At the end of it, I will be able to offer others a valuable tool in divination as well as a beautiful work of art. Moreover, it's a reminder that we are still a part of the natural world. I chose bones as the primary material for this project because throughout the entirety of the body of a vertebrate animal–human included–the bones are the strongest portions. They provide a scaffolding on which the rest of the animal is built, and they remain long after flesh and sinew have gone away. Likewise, although generations of people come and go, the desire to connect to something greater than one’s self and to engage one’s intuition endures. Through bones we can speak with our evolutionary ancestors; through divination we create patterns that help us make sense of the world around us–and the worlds within.


Finally, whether you're able to back this campaign or not, please help spread the word! Use the share tools that IndieGoGo provides. Post a link on Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter and elsewhere. Email people you think would be interested. Contact alternative, art and other media sources who may be interested in covering what I'm working on here (I have a press release available if you need it!) The more people who know about this campaign, the merrier--and the stronger the Tarot of Bones will be!
Thank you to all of you for your help,

<p>The project will be a 10 foot tall hanging steel Pinata that will be suspended from a sturdy steel frame.

<p>My project has been funded by Burning Flipside to the tune of $150.00. That money was granted due to an award for being the most absurd, yet environmentally friendly piece of art submitted for a grant at Burning Flipside. </p>

<p>WeScreen Studio, a new project put together by River Takada of RIVTAK Handmade, to raise funds to purchase the MiScreen- a custom screen maker produced by RISO Japan.  The screen making machine will greatly streamline and provide inclusive tools for future students during creative workshops for all ages. </p>
<ul>
<li>For the past 7 years, River has taught kids and adults a variety of textile skills, including the skills in low-tech screen printing- sharing her love for creative expression and play.  River has found that there are many limitations based on time and ability when it comes to learning a new skill and achieving goals in a workshop.  Students are limited to using the screens and images River has prepped in advance, or hand cutting out their own designs via a stencil.  Stencil cutting is an art form in itself and is very challenging to kids and people with limited hand abilities.  For many years, River has wished to have a machine that could instantly creative custom screens so everyone could play and experiment for the maximum amount of time at a workshop.  Enter the MiScreen- a machine that can transfer a design straight from a computer screen to a mesh screen in moments and get anyone printing!</li>
<li>With your donation, you are investing in future community creativity!   With the funds from this campaign, we will have access to making original screens so each student can express themselves with their experimental prints!  Small businesses will have access to creating an affordable screen, bands will have access to create a screen to print their own merchandise and fund their future projects!  Couples and families can get creative together while planning their weddings, family reunions and birthday parties!  Expecting a big life change - like having a baby- Host a creative party with originally printed invitations, or print things as your party activity.  The creative possibilities are endless.</li>
<li>When we acquire the MiScreen, we will officially open the WE-screen service branch and adding it to the Rivtak.com website, as <u>WeScreen Studio</u>.  This will be a new service to encourage our students beyond a workshop or classroom and hope it will be inclusive and provide an affordable option for creating 2D art for personal or commercial use.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our minimum goal of $3200 is needed to purchase the MiScreen Machine made by RISO, along with the minimum amount of tools needed for small group workshops and the basic supplies to start testing/training and fulfilling perks. </li>
<li>Our stretch goal of $5500 is needed to purchase all the additional tools required to ensure a productive workshop experience, like a designated workshop laptop for the MiScreen software, scanner, drying rack, and an equipment station/cart to transport everything to workshops, along with 6 months rent to our storage unit studio space, set up specially for this project to train and test the new machine and record video tutorials!</li>
<li>Immediate Perks include getting an exclusive coupon code to order your own original design made into a screen in our first year in operation!  As soon as we get the machine, we plan on making screens-to-order so you can print at home!  And since you donated, you'll get to order as many original made-to-order at a premium discount- depending on your donation tier.  Each perk also includes a special digital ""thank you"" and custom prints along with some surprises!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we hope to reach at least our bare minimum needed to invest in the RISO made MiScreen Machine, retailing at $2500.  Everything else on our supply list will be purchased over time with the funds we can save from selling made-to-order screens- which means it might take longer for us to set up a streamlined working space and provide workshops. </li>
<li>If we surpass our stretch goal, You will be investing in our community further by allowing us to provided sponsored (by You!) workshops for communities who want art therapy and community building!  With funds raised beyond our stretch goal, we'll be able to pay for supplies and labor to take our MiScreen into schools and beyond to promote creative expression.</li>
<li>Please share with your community to ensure we meet our goal so we can hurry up and set up shop!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our hope is to bring the MiScreen machine into classrooms.  We will travel once it's safe, but until then, we plan to create instruction videos to show people how to best utilize the machine we will all be investing in.  We hope to inspire creativity, and support local creatives by offering an affordable option for making screens.  Screen printing can be used in so many different ways, from making a profit, to having a craft afternoon with friends and family.</li>
<li>River has taught at institutions and creative hubs like NC Museum of Art, Duke Create, The ArtsCenter of Carrboro, Freeman's Creative, NCSU Craft Center and the Scrap Exchange.</li>
<li>We hope to share the MiScreen resources and provide the complete seamless experince with all the equipment purchased from this fundraiser to make set up and transportation to workshops easier for future instructors.  Setting up for a creative workshop is very laborious with toting in all the things, in our stretch goal we have budgeted for a workshop station on wheels which will house all our basic supplies and tools need for each workshop!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're doing a 'flex' campaign. That means that it isn't an ""all or nothing"" situation. BUT, we still need money and community support and backing to get this project off the ground. $5500 is our place to start, get research and development going, and screens out the door.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we hope to reach at least our bare minimum needed to invest in the RISO made MiScreen Machine, retailing at $2500.  Everything else on our supply list will be purchased over time with the funds we can save from selling made-to-order screens- which means it might take longer for us to set up a streamlined working space and provide workshops. </p>

</div><p>Thank you again of your support and please consider donating to this community project!</p></div>","WeScreen Studio, a new project put together by River Takada of RIVTAK Handmade, to raise funds to purchase the MiScreen- a custom screen maker produced by RISO Japan.  The screen making machine will greatly streamline and provide inclusive tools for future students during creative workshops for all ages. 

For the past 7 years, River has taught kids and adults a variety of textile skills, including the skills in low-tech screen printing- sharing her love for creative expression and play.  River has found that there are many limitations based on time and ability when it comes to learning a new skill and achieving goals in a workshop.  Students are limited to using the screens and images River has prepped in advance, or hand cutting out their own designs via a stencil.  Stencil cutting is an art form in itself and is very challenging to kids and people with limited hand abilities.  For many years, River has wished to have a machine that could instantly creative custom screens so everyone could play and experiment for the maximum amount of time at a workshop.  Enter the MiScreen- a machine that can transfer a design straight from a computer screen to a mesh screen in moments and get anyone printing!
With your donation, you are investing in future community creativity!   With the funds from this campaign, we will have access to making original screens so each student can express themselves with their experimental prints!  Small businesses will have access to creating an affordable screen, bands will have access to create a screen to print their own merchandise and fund their future projects!  Couples and families can get creative together while planning their weddings, family reunions and birthday parties!  Expecting a big life change - like having a baby- Host a creative party with originally printed invitations, or print things as your party activity.  The creative possibilities are endless.
When we acquire the MiScreen, we will officially open the WE-screen service branch and adding it to the Rivtak.com website, as WeScreen Studio.  This will be a new service to encourage our students beyond a workshop or classroom and hope it will be inclusive and provide an affordable option for creating 2D art for personal or commercial use.


What We Need & What You Get

Our minimum goal of $3200 is needed to purchase the MiScreen Machine made by RISO, along with the minimum amount of tools needed for small group workshops and the basic supplies to start testing/training and fulfilling perks. 
Our stretch goal of $5500 is needed to purchase all the additional tools required to ensure a productive workshop experience, like a designated workshop laptop for the MiScreen software, scanner, drying rack, and an equipment station/cart to transport everything to workshops, along with 6 months rent to our storage unit studio space, set up specially for this project to train and test the new machine and record video tutorials!
Immediate Perks include getting an exclusive coupon code to order your own original design made into a screen in our first year in operation!  As soon as we get the machine, we plan on making screens-to-order so you can print at home!  And since you donated, you'll get to order as many original made-to-order at a premium discount- depending on your donation tier.  Each perk also includes a special digital ""thank you"" and custom prints along with some surprises!
If we don't reach our entire goal, we hope to reach at least our bare minimum needed to invest in the RISO made MiScreen Machine, retailing at $2500.  Everything else on our supply list will be purchased over time with the funds we can save from selling made-to-order screens- which means it might take longer for us to set up a streamlined working space and provide workshops. 
If we surpass our stretch goal, You will be investing in our community further by allowing us to provided sponsored (by You!) workshops for communities who want art therapy and community building!  With funds raised beyond our stretch goal, we'll be able to pay for supplies and labor to take our MiScreen into schools and beyond to promote creative expression.
Please share with your community to ensure we meet our goal so we can hurry up and set up shop!


The Impact

Our hope is to bring the MiScreen machine into classrooms.  We will travel once it's safe, but until then, we plan to create instruction videos to show people how to best utilize the machine we will all be investing in.  We hope to inspire creativity, and support local creatives by offering an affordable option for making screens.  Screen printing can be used in so many different ways, from making a profit, to having a craft afternoon with friends and family.
River has taught at institutions and creative hubs like NC Museum of Art, Duke Create, The ArtsCenter of Carrboro, Freeman's Creative, NCSU Craft Center and the Scrap Exchange.
We hope to share the MiScreen resources and provide the complete seamless experince with all the equipment purchased from this fundraiser to make set up and transportation to workshops easier for future instructors.  Setting up for a creative workshop is very laborious with toting in all the things, in our stretch goal we have budgeted for a workshop station on wheels which will house all our basic supplies and tools need for each workshop!

A central thesis of her work is that  language that evolves as a solution to survival pressures in 200,000 BCE becomes an existential threat to humans by 2000 CE. She reveals that a new mind configuration, with multiple and non-linguistic consciousnesses, rooted in the deep history of humans in landscape, makes survival of the anthropocene (for humans and non-humans) possible. </p>

<div><h3>About:</h3></div>
<p>Through The Arctic Circle 2017 residency, I seek to keep making images that engage in an ongoing regional conversation that surrounds the growth and evolution of Maine’s relationship to the North Atlantic and the Arctic. Going forward, I must consider and expand my response to participate in a constantly evolving conversation and in congruence to other new contextual positions. For instance, how do initiatives for the economic development of Maine acknowledge and/or ignore Arctic issues while simultaneously leveraging changes in climate?</p>
<p><strong>ICELANDx207</strong><br/>In 2013, the Icelandic shipping company, Eimskip, moved their North American headquarters to Portland, Maine. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>As an artist, the newly arrived royal blue shipping containers at the International Marine Terminal signified both the growing exchange of goods + services and a hidden cultural + human entanglement that needed to be observed, recorded and shared. In 2015, I received an individual artist project grant from the Maine Arts Commission that allowed me to participate in a nine-day artist residency aboard an Eimskip container ship from Portland, ME to Reykjavík and to discover those elements through a podcast and photography at the liminal space between exchange; at the intersection of art + commerce. This project lives as ICELANDx207 (<a href=""http://icelandx207.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>).</span></p>
<p><b>Going Back (to the sea), To Move Forward</b><br/>The previous work I produced at sea focuses on Maine’s connection to Iceland via Eimskip’s Green Line shipping route and pays close to attention to the humanity found in shipping and at sea. Yet despite that thoughtful effort, the truth of the perspective I’ve provided remains undoubtedly rooted in issues more specific to exchange and commerce. It is but one half of an answer to a much larger question. </p>
<p>In contrast, I imagine the traditional Tall Ship harkens back to a simpler time like reading a book instead of infinitely scrolling up. It’s with this sentiment of respect for natural beauty combined with the research and investigative efforts onboard that I can continue to address both integral components of the same coin.</p>
<p>For the new work produced during this residency, the mutually shared arena of the sea will act as the scientific control in presenting these intersecting yet polarizing concepts through similar but distinct viewpoints. I will experience the underlying source of our current conversations and bring that story’s voice to the table. I am confident it is here I will find the next images I need to make.</p>

<h3>Why Maine? + Experience: </h3>
<p>From <a href=""http://maineandthearctic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maine and The Arctic</a>:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Arctic change will have a direct impact on Maine’s economy, coastline, and natural resources. Until recently, Alaska has been the only U.S. state to have a voice in current Arctic affairs.

</div></div>","About:
Through The Arctic Circle 2017 residency, I seek to keep making images that engage in an ongoing regional conversation that surrounds the growth and evolution of Maine’s relationship to the North Atlantic and the Arctic. Going forward, I must consider and expand my response to participate in a constantly evolving conversation and in congruence to other new contextual positions. For instance, how do initiatives for the economic development of Maine acknowledge and/or ignore Arctic issues while simultaneously leveraging changes in climate?
ICELANDx207In 2013, the Icelandic shipping company, Eimskip, moved their North American headquarters to Portland, Maine. As an artist, the newly arrived royal blue shipping containers at the International Marine Terminal signified both the growing exchange of goods + services and a hidden cultural + human entanglement that needed to be observed, recorded and shared. In 2015, I received an individual artist project grant from the Maine Arts Commission that allowed me to participate in a nine-day artist residency aboard an Eimskip container ship from Portland, ME to Reykjavík and to discover those elements through a podcast and photography at the liminal space between exchange; at the intersection of art + commerce. This project lives as ICELANDx207 (website).
Going Back (to the sea), To Move ForwardThe previous work I produced at sea focuses on Maine’s connection to Iceland via Eimskip’s Green Line shipping route and pays close to attention to the humanity found in shipping and at sea. Yet despite that thoughtful effort, the truth of the perspective I’ve provided remains undoubtedly rooted in issues more specific to exchange and commerce. It is but one half of an answer to a much larger question. 
In contrast, I imagine the traditional Tall Ship harkens back to a simpler time like reading a book instead of infinitely scrolling up. It’s with this sentiment of respect for natural beauty combined with the research and investigative efforts onboard that I can continue to address both integral components of the same coin.
For the new work produced during this residency, the mutually shared arena of the sea will act as the scientific control in presenting these intersecting yet polarizing concepts through similar but distinct viewpoints. I will experience the underlying source of our current conversations and bring that story’s voice to the table. I am confident it is here I will find the next images I need to make.

Why Maine? + Experience: 
From Maine and The Arctic:
Arctic change will have a direct impact on Maine’s economy, coastline, and natural resources. Until recently, Alaska has been the only U.S. state to have a voice in current Arctic affairs. In 2013, the Maine North Atlantic Development Office (MENADO) was formed as an initiative of the Maine International Trade Center to increase trade and investment between Maine and markets of the North Atlantic Region and to develop Maine’s policy in Arctic Affairs.
MENADO was awarded the opportunity to host the Arctic Council Senior Arctic Officials meetings in Portland (October 4-6, 2016).

About four years ago I created an anonymous virtual artist named Bryn Oh with the intention of seeing whether a digital character could be accepted and succeed outside its virtual world and in the land of flesh and blood artists.  Would people scoff at the idea or would it capture their imagination?  Since that time Bryn's work has been shown at  Nuit Blanche,
the World Expo in Shanghai (Madrid Pavilion), with IBM, in movies such as ""My
avatar and me"" and in projects with people such as Cannes winning
director Peter Greenaway (Big Bang) and artist Stelarc.
  Bryn was also a  Web3D
Conference presenter in Paris, France as well as profiled on RAI
TV in Italy and Art21. 
Bryn has had the good fortune to exhibit in various Universities worldwide and has also been added to the syllabus of others. Currently Bryn is the subject of three thesis works and has recently received
a New Media grant from the Canadian government.     The government
grant is to produce a 30 minute machinima
(Bryn Oh is actually even mentioned in this wikipedia definition under 'sound in machinima') and to create an
exhibit in a museum or gallery which would then incorporate Second Life.  In September, Bryn
was written about in Vogue
magazine (Italy) while also exhibiting Second Life artwork at a museum in Rome (Museo
in Commune) .  
     I generally just create narratives that reflect on things in my  life and I have discovered that many people  share an empathy towards these works.  The success of Bryn has been very surprising and rewarding for me.

<h3>Embracing The Future: A BNHA Fanmade Tarot Deck </h3>
<p>Hello! The BNHA Tarot Mod Team are very excited to finally bring forth this wonderful tarot deck created by our extremely wonderful and patient contributors.</p>
<p>This project went through a lot of rough spots, and it's definitely been quite a ride, going through quite the game of hot potato before finally ending up with the current mod team. It was a lot of hard work and now nearly a year later, we finally have preorders open, so thank you for everyone's support and we hope you enjoy the beautiful tarot deck and wonderful merch pieces these amazing artists have lovingly made. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>The BNHA Tarot Project has 60+ contributors, 78 cards and over 20 merch pieces. As such to be able to print everything and fairly compensate all the artists and mods behind this project our goal is $10,000!</p>
<h3><strong>Goal Break Down</strong></h3>
<p>Now 10k sounds like a lot, and it definitely is, so here's why. We want to be able to compensate our contributors fairly with a full bundle so our calculation of the goal was made with that in mind! Taking that into account it would cost a total of $5,000 to be able to do this. </p>
<ul>
<li>$3,500 | Participant Compensation: This is the amount of money necessary to be able to give all contributors a free bundle as thanks for their amazing work!</li>
<li>$1,500 | Participant Shipping: Shipping can be pricey especially when it comes to heavier packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the other 5k goes into a contributor printing. How does that work? I basically calculated how much we would need to sell in order to be able to compensate our contributors.</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,000 | Deck Printing: Due to M.O.Q's deck printing is at a solid price. </li>
<li>$1000-$2000 | Merch Printing: Because it's very difficult to determine the total amount of merch that will be necessary this particular expense is not set in stone and will fluctuate depending on what bundles the customers prefer.</li>
<li>$1000 | Shipping expenses: We also have to take into account shipping expenses for our customers and because it depends on the number of purchases, this particular cost isn't set in stone but can fluctuate.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Hello! The BNHA Tarot Mod Team are very excited to finally bring forth this wonderful tarot deck created by our extremely wonderful and patient contributors.
This project went through a lot of rough spots, and it's definitely been quite a ride, going through quite the game of hot potato before finally ending up with the current mod team. It was a lot of hard work and now nearly a year later, we finally have preorders open, so thank you for everyone's support and we hope you enjoy the beautiful tarot deck and wonderful merch pieces these amazing artists have lovingly made. 

Our Goal
The BNHA Tarot Project has 60+ contributors, 78 cards and over 20 merch pieces. As such to be able to print everything and fairly compensate all the artists and mods behind this project our goal is $10,000!
Goal Break Down
Now 10k sounds like a lot, and it definitely is, so here's why. We want to be able to compensate our contributors fairly with a full bundle so our calculation of the goal was made with that in mind! Taking that into account it would cost a total of $5,000 to be able to do this. 

$3,500 | Participant Compensation: This is the amount of money necessary to be able to give all contributors a free bundle as thanks for their amazing work!
$1,500 | Participant Shipping: Shipping can be pricey especially when it comes to heavier packages.

Now the other 5k goes into a contributor printing. How does that work? I basically calculated how much we would need to sell in order to be able to compensate our contributors.

$2,000 | Deck Printing: Due to M.O.Q's deck printing is at a solid price. 
$1000-$2000 | Merch Printing: Because it's very difficult to determine the total amount of merch that will be necessary this particular expense is not set in stone and will fluctuate depending on what bundles the customers prefer.
$1000 | Shipping expenses: We also have to take into account shipping expenses for our customers and because it depends on the number of purchases, this particular cost isn't set in stone but can fluctuate.


Risks & Challenges
Every project comes with its own risks and challenges. In the BNHA Tarot project, poses the risk of not being fully funded like most projects always pose. Additionally, while we will be doing our best to be as quick and efficient as possible, there always exists the risk of shipping delays due to any issues that may arise with the manufacturers, but rest assured we will keep everyone updated in everything!

I’d like to change that. I want to charge $5 (USD) per accepted work – not submitted, accepted. Trust me, it’s a big deal. The <a href=""http://www.whistlestop-gallery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whistle Stop Gallery</a> also takes no commissions on sales from the web Shows. That’s a big deal too. Like what you’re seeing? Read on!</strong></p><p>My website is all set for the next 10 years! Well, the hosting and the domains are. All I have to do is to write it and run it. That shouldn’t be too hard, right? And it only cost me $1436! Well, that’s not really <u>only</u> to me, no matter how many times the salesperson says it’s a ‘good deal’. Their ‘good deal’ is almost 2 months of expenses to me. This is where you come in. I’d like at least 1436 of you reading this to chip in $1.</p><p><strong>What do you get out of it? You get to finish a sentence.</strong> Not just any sentence… a really special one. Why do you care? Because your name will appear with it, at the bottom of the main website, for at least the next 10 years. Of course, only one will display at a time – otherwise the page would get kind of long. Each will have an opportunity to display in a random fashion. Each sentence will also appear in The Big List (yes, I named it The Big List), which is a list of all the quotes. It’s your chance to be famous… well, sort of. No, I don’t get many visitors right now, but your $1 will help me concentrate on that.</p><p>You never know what the future holds. This one sentence of yours might result in fame and fortune. Probably not, but we can dream, right? Your words <u>will</u> inspire artists – that I can promise. Plus, you get to share your thoughts with everyone who visits my site. As long as I approve them, anyway. I know you’re thinking “riiight, he’s going to post what I have to say.” I really will, as long as it’s family-friendly (c’mon, you know what that is). Not hateful, nasty, racist, obscene… you get the idea. Oh, and I might have to discuss shortening it with you, but only if you write extremely long, run on sentences. We’ll need to work together to eradicate spelling and punctuation errors, too.</p><p>I do have one more rule: I only speak English. I tried to learn another language – it didn’t go smoothly. I doubt I’d get many Latin submissions, though. I have to be able to read what you wrote. You don’t have to write it in English, but what you give me needs to be. It’s also only fair, since the rest of the site is in English too.</p><h3><strong>Here’s the mysterious sentence that I’m sure you have a burning desire to know. Here it comes.</strong></h3><h2>Art is:</h2><p>Yes, that’s it. If you’re serious about it, you’ll have trouble finishing the sentence. If not, you get to dazzle us with your amazing wit. You could even go severely minimalist and put nothing… but I’d rather not get too many of those or it will look like my website is broken.</p><p><strong>Still not sure? Really? Can you name one really great reason you shouldn’t? Didn’t think so. Try it! It’ll be fun! Or serious, or meditative, or comedic, or thoughtful…</strong></p><p>Your words might even appear in a book someday.</p><p>You’ll need to provide me and the Whistle Stop Gallery the right to display the final approved quote for free and forever, as long as it has your name (or whatever name you provided) displayed with it. If a book is ever in the works, you’ll get a request for that specifically.</p><p><strong><i>Really don’t want to be Quoted? Looking for something else? I have other Perks, too!</i></strong></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>What I need</strong></h3><p>I already paid the $1436. It includes 8 domains and web hosting. And by paid I mean <u>paying</u> little bits each month, with interest. You see where I’m heading. I really need that money for other expenses, like taxes.</p><p><strong>My goal is to start offering at least 2 web Shows a year that artists can submit to, starting with a show later this year. And of course to get the rest of the website running smoothly, which is mostly done.</strong></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3><ul>
<li><p>$250 more than my goal: The next Best of Show award becomes $250, instead of $50 like I originally planned. This would be for the Whistle Stop Gallery Winter*16 web Show.</p></li>
<li><p>$1000 more: Winter*16 becomes free for artists. No fees to submit, no fees to be in the show. And I’ll award a $250 Best of Show. How’s that sound?</p></li>
<li><p>$5000 – the next 4 web Shows after Winter*16 get the same treatment!</p></li>
<li><p>$10,000 – 4 more web Shows get the same treatment. This would be incredible!</p></li>
<li><p>$100,000 – Oh my! Didn’t expect that. Is that some kind of record? Uhh… I know! EVERY web Show for the Whistle Stop Gallery becomes free starting with Winter*16, with a $250 Best of Show prize awarded in each!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>""But I don’t LIKE writing!""</strong> If you REALLY can’t come up with anything to say, for $3 I can write a Quote for you, and it becomes yours. You have to pick the subject though. You can choose intellectual, serious, funny, weird, or art-specific. Can’t decide? Too bad. If I’m writing it for you, you at least need to pick. If you’d like to modify the Quote to suit your taste, I can do that too.</p></li>

The panel’s reused plastics make a perfect backing for new primed canvas. It’s your choice, either one, in portrait or landscape format. The panel is paired with a frame and hanging hardware. It also includes an opportunity to display your finished work. Normally I charge shipping for these, but right now there is absolutely no shipping cost. Get one today for only $15!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Web Tour:</strong> Want a tour of the Gallery’s web home? For only $30 you get a tour of the website. After that, I’ll answer up to 50 of your questions about it – as long as you don’t ask me to reveal the security, which I won’t do. Sorry web vandals, no secrets for you. I’ll also give you special early information for a whole year about what’s going on with the site, before the public can see it. That includes new content and upcoming shows. Nosy people take notice!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Like the Quoted logo?</strong> For only $35 you get the graphite idea sketch of the Quoted project logo! It’s signed, too. I’ll mat and frame it, so it’s ready to display!

<li><p><strong>Participate and be named! </strong>For $50 you get to help me test the website. I’ll tell you what I expect – it’s nothing more than using the site and telling me about it in plain language. I’ll thank you personally on the site for your work, and write you a reference letter. You also get to provide a link for me to display, subject to approval. It must be family friendly. No link farms or spam pages either. Applying for a job soon? <i>Note: I can't give you the reference letter until you actually do the testing.</i></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Like artwork? Like free shipping? Like great deals?</strong> Well, here’s one for you! My selling price for 8x10 inch paintings is $135 framed. I have two listed on my personal shop right now for exactly that price, and there’s also a shipping charge. If a few of you will help me out, I’ll paint a new 8x10, frame it, and ship it to you for only $75! You don’t have to pay shipping, and you’re getting it for $60 cheaper!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Art for all seasons.</strong> For $100 get this amazing photo set. I chose these four photos of mine to represent the four seasons. Only two sets were made.

<li><p><strong>The Gallery Tour: </strong>Maybe you really want to see the Gallery in person. <strong>It isn’t open to the public right now, but</strong> for $250<strong> you get to visit the Whistle Stop Gallery’s Granite City home.</strong> Step inside, hear about the history of the building and what I know about the area, and about what I’m trying to do! <strong>You also get to TAKE HOME a piece of the Gallery with you!</strong> The building’s old brick, and some of it is damaged. I save the pieces, which get turned into original paintings by local artists. I’ll give it to you while you’re here. Feel free to take photos if you want, too. You also get a map of downtown points of interest, and a list of city-wide points of interest. <u>THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE YOUR TRAVEL AND LODGING; YOU MUST GET HERE ON YOUR OWN. </u>The Gallery is located in Granite City, Illinois, 62040, USA. I’ll give you the address by email. You MUST work out a time to visit, you cannot just stop by! You may bring one guest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Gallery Tour - remotely:</strong> (also $250) Can’t make it to Granite City, Illinois but still want to see it? I’ll record a video tour for you and send it to you. You can also ask questions after and I’ll send you a video with responses. <strong>You also get a piece of the Gallery with an original painting on it!</strong> I’ll have to ship the art to you, so I have to limit where I can send it. Due to this being a larger contribution, I can do some (but not all) international shipping while just covering the cost.

</ul><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3><p>I’m writing the site myself, so there’s a small chance the randomizer won’t work well at first. It <u>will</u> work, even if I have to use the ugliest code imaginable. But I’m very confident it will work nicely, especially since I finally gave in and agreed to use a database. The Big List is a simple page, so there’s not much that can go wrong there. There’s a tiny possibility that your Quote might end up with a typo, but I’d be more than happy to fix it. I’m really stubborn and persistent, so if it’s between me and the server, the server loses. Seriously, I prepared in advance. The major parts of the new site are already operating. This is a really cool addition to an operating website.</p><p>It’s also hard to get people to visit the website. One of the reasons for this campaign is to use everything I can to get the word out in new and different ways. Hey, you’re looking, right? I’ve got other really great ideas that I can’t concentrate on right now, but your contribution could change that.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Other ways you can help</strong></h3><p><strong>If you absolutely, positively can’t spare a dollar, you could share this campaign with others.</strong> Of course, it doesn’t really help if you tell people not to participate, but I think you already know that. Use the Indiegogo share tools! Visit the Whistle Stop Gallery website, too. Know any artists? Tell them how much you like the Whistle Stop Gallery! Share this with friends and followers, many or few.

Are you new?</u></i></p><p>No. The Whistle Stop Gallery has been around since our first show in 2008. You’ve just never heard of us until now.</p><p><i><u>Is the Whistle Stop Gallery only online?</u></i></p><p>No. There is a physical gallery too, but it’s closed for renovations right now.</p><p><i><u>Is the Whistle Stop Gallery a commercial gallery?</u></i></p><p>Yes it is. It’s a for-profit, but its purpose isn’t to make a profit.</p><p><i><u>Where’s the rest of your staff?</u></i></p><p>When I told people that I could pay them in thanks and warm wishes, they didn’t want the job. Go figure. Seriously, the Whistle Stop Gallery can’t afford staff. I don’t even get paid yet.</p><p><i><u>I see you’re giving away art as perks. Who’s the artist?</u></i></p><p>That would be me. Would you like to offer something too? Contact me and we’ll discuss it.</p><p><i><u>Is whistlestop-gallery.com going to disappear if you aren’t fully funded?</u></i></p><p>No. It’s been around since 2007, and it’s not going anywhere, especially since it’s already paid for.</p><p><i><u>Do I have to be an artist to participate?</u></i></p><p>Definitely not. I’d really like to hear from everyone, artists, art lovers, and even art haters too!</p><p><i><u>How long will it be before my quote appears on the website?</u></i></p><p>Hmmm. Well, I work on the website by hand – with the keyboard. And fingers. So, your quote should show up in the Big List within a week (unless something goes wrong). The randomizer isn’t done yet, but as soon as it is I’ll start loading the quotes in there too. If you’d like updates by email, contact me and let me know. I can let you know when yours is posted too.</p><p>I’ll be keeping offline backups too, so the worst that could happen is that I have to (sigh) retype each one.</p><p>The basics of the new website are already in place.

Check out my other Perks. You can also contact me.</p><p><i><u>My name is too big. What do I do?</u></i></p><p>Wow. Your name is more than 255 characters? I guess I’ll have to modify the randomizer backend. Until then, it will still be in The Big List.</p><p><i><u>My quote is too big. What do I do?</u></i></p><p>That’s a pretty long quote. Let’s review it and I’ll decide if it needs to be shorter, or if the randomizer needs to be modified for longer lengths.</p><p><i><u>Do I have to put my name?</u></i></p><p>You can be anonymous, or only use a first or last name or a nickname if you want. Pen names work too.</p><p><i><u>How can I contact you?</u></i></p><p>You can contact me on this site directly, or via my form on the Whistle Stop Gallery website. You can even mail me a letter – the address is on the Whistle Stop Gallery Site too. If you’re using the Whistle Stop Gallery form, please remember it’s not a secure form, so don’t put bank or credit card stuff in there. If you’re having trouble getting a hold of me, you can reach out to Indiegogo too – they can get in touch as well.</p><p><i><u>How much will it cost to ship my Perk?</u></i></p><p>It doesn’t. I pay the shipping. If it can be shipped to your address, the shipping's free.</p><p><i><u>Why do some of the Perks only ship to the United States?</u></i></p><p>I can offer better Perks that way. Have an idea of how I can ship Perks internationally without outrageous shipping costs? Contact me and tell me about it!</p><p><i><u>Why do you keep capitalizing Show and Shows?</u></i></p><p>It’s a part of the Whistle Stop Gallery website. It’s divided into Shows, Galleries, Projects, and Proposals. And last but not least the main Site, which displays the randomized quotes. That’s why Site is sometimes capitalized too - it’s the Site section of the Whistle Stop Gallery website. Confused yet?</p></div>","Get out your phones and get ready for some paper-flinging fun! It's the Go to the Whistle Stop Gallery... Man... game.Now for the really, really short version.The world needs art. You’re part of the world. You need art. So, you need artists. Artists need to succeed to create the art you need. Help me help artists succeed.Back my campaign. You get cheap cool stuff, artists get cheap cool stuff. Help me get to my goal, and you get free cool stuff. Help me get more than my goal, and both you and artists get free cool stuff.That’s pretty much it.I wish you’d read the long version though. It’s a lot more fun.Follow the Whistle Stop Gallery on Twitter and like us on Facebook!How does this help artists?Entering art shows can get expensive real quick. I’d like to change that. I want to charge $5 (USD) per accepted work – not submitted, accepted. Trust me, it’s a big deal. The Whistle Stop Gallery also takes no commissions on sales from the web Shows. That’s a big deal too. Like what you’re seeing? Read on!My website is all set for the next 10 years! Well, the hosting and the domains are. All I have to do is to write it and run it. That shouldn’t be too hard, right? And it only cost me $1436! Well, that’s not really only to me, no matter how many times the salesperson says it’s a ‘good deal’. Their ‘good deal’ is almost 2 months of expenses to me. This is where you come in. I’d like at least 1436 of you reading this to chip in $1.What do you get out of it? You get to finish a sentence. Not just any sentence… a really special one. Why do you care? Because your name will appear with it, at the bottom of the main website, for at least the next 10 years. Of course, only one will display at a time – otherwise the page would get kind of long. Each will have an opportunity to display in a random fashion. Each sentence will also appear in The Big List (yes, I named it The Big List), which is a list of all the quotes. It’s your chance to be famous… well, sort of. No, I don’t get many visitors right now, but your $1 will help me concentrate on that.You never know what the future holds. This one sentence of yours might result in fame and fortune. Probably not, but we can dream, right? Your words will inspire artists – that I can promise. Plus, you get to share your thoughts with everyone who visits my site. As long as I approve them, anyway. I know you’re thinking “riiight, he’s going to post what I have to say.” I really will, as long as it’s family-friendly (c’mon, you know what that is). Not hateful, nasty, racist, obscene… you get the idea. Oh, and I might have to discuss shortening it with you, but only if you write extremely long, run on sentences. We’ll need to work together to eradicate spelling and punctuation errors, too.I do have one more rule: I only speak English. I tried to learn another language – it didn’t go smoothly. I doubt I’d get many Latin submissions, though. I have to be able to read what you wrote. You don’t have to write it in English, but what you give me needs to be. It’s also only fair, since the rest of the site is in English too.Here’s the mysterious sentence that I’m sure you have a burning desire to know. Here it comes.Art is:Yes, that’s it. If you’re serious about it, you’ll have trouble finishing the sentence. If not, you get to dazzle us with your amazing wit. You could even go severely minimalist and put nothing… but I’d rather not get too many of those or it will look like my website is broken.Still not sure? Really? Can you name one really great reason you shouldn’t? Didn’t think so. Try it! It’ll be fun! Or serious, or meditative, or comedic, or thoughtful…Your words might even appear in a book someday.You’ll need to provide me and the Whistle Stop Gallery the right to display the final approved quote for free and forever, as long as it has your name (or whatever name you provided) displayed with it. If a book is ever in the works, you’ll get a request for that specifically.Really don’t want to be Quoted? Looking for something else? I have other Perks, too! What I needI already paid the $1436. It includes 8 domains and web hosting. And by paid I mean paying little bits each month, with interest. You see where I’m heading. I really need that money for other expenses, like taxes.My goal is to start offering at least 2 web Shows a year that artists can submit to, starting with a show later this year. And of course to get the rest of the website running smoothly, which is mostly done. Stretch Goals
$250 more than my goal: The next Best of Show award becomes $250, instead of $50 like I originally planned. This would be for the Whistle Stop Gallery Winter*16 web Show.
$1000 more: Winter*16 becomes free for artists. No fees to submit, no fees to be in the show. And I’ll award a $250 Best of Show. How’s that sound?
$5000 – the next 4 web Shows after Winter*16 get the same treatment!
$10,000 – 4 more web Shows get the same treatment. This would be incredible!
$100,000 – Oh my! Didn’t expect that. Is that some kind of record? Uhh… I know! EVERY web Show for the Whistle Stop Gallery becomes free starting with Winter*16, with a $250 Best of Show prize awarded in each!
 What you get: Everybody who backs this campaign gets a badge! Show off your support for the arts - back this campaign at any level and you get a nifty badge image.I’m offering another really special gift to all Quoted Project supporters. If I reach my goal, every backer gets an artsy photo taken especially for them. I’ll send each of you a file that you can print, use in and for ‘stuff’, and pretty much anything (other than selling the file to someone else, because you got it for free). I enjoy photography, but don’t get much chance.Give me an excuse to take a few thousand photos! Get this campaign through its goal! 
Quoted. For $1 you get to be Quoted and have it displayed on my website with your name, as I described earlier. Missed it? Go back and read it again – make sure you read the rules.
You want a thank you, too? For $2 you can be Quoted and I’ll post a personal thank you @1938State on Twitter and Facebook.
""But I don’t LIKE writing!"" If you REALLY can’t come up with anything to say, for $3 I can write a Quote for you, and it becomes yours. You have to pick the subject though. You can choose intellectual, serious, funny, weird, or art-specific. Can’t decide? Too bad. If I’m writing it for you, you at least need to pick. If you’d like to modify the Quote to suit your taste, I can do that too.

Enjoy a card now and then? For $5 I’ll draw a card, personalize it, and send it to you. I’m covering the shipping for the card.


Like puzzles? For $10 I’ll create, personalize, and send you a hand drawn card, and I’ll make you one of my fun hand-drawn paper puzzles too! The puzzle comes in the card. I’m covering the shipping.
You’re an artist? Well maybe you’d like a Joseph’s ReMedia™ or Joseph’s ReSurface™ artist’s panel! Artist meet Joseph’s ReMedia(tm) - the gesso-coated Artist’s Panel made of plastics destined for the landfill. You don’t want canvas on a surface, you want a Joseph’s ReSurface(tm). The panel’s reused plastics make a perfect backing for new primed canvas. It’s your choice, either one, in portrait or landscape format. The panel is paired with a frame and hanging hardware. It also includes an opportunity to display your finished work. Normally I charge shipping for these, but right now there is absolutely no shipping cost. Get one today for only $15!
Your Quote deserves more. For just $20 get an original Joseph A. Langley typography design of your Quote. As an added bonus, commercial use is included! That means you can even print it on t-shirts, cards, etc. and sell them! You also get the source file. I’ve added a few examples of my typography work.

Need a little extra security? For $25 get 100 sheets (yes, a hundred sheets) of my ReSecure™ paper. I draw on old catalog pages with marker. I can’t guarantee it will be completely secure, but I can guarantee it’s an improvement over not using any! Each sheet is about 8.25 inches by 10.25 inches. Once again, I’m covering shipping.


The Web Tour: Want a tour of the Gallery’s web home? For only $30 you get a tour of the website. After that, I’ll answer up to 50 of your questions about it – as long as you don’t ask me to reveal the security, which I won’t do. Sorry web vandals, no secrets for you. I’ll also give you special early information for a whole year about what’s going on with the site, before the public can see it. That includes new content and upcoming shows. Nosy people take notice!
Like the Quoted logo? For only $35 you get the graphite idea sketch of the Quoted project logo! It’s signed, too. I’ll mat and frame it, so it’s ready to display! Wouldn’t you like to own the only one? Get it before someone else does! Shipping is included in the $35, by the way.
Participate and be named! For $50 you get to help me test the website. I’ll tell you what I expect – it’s nothing more than using the site and telling me about it in plain language. I’ll thank you personally on the site for your work, and write you a reference letter. You also get to provide a link for me to display, subject to approval. It must be family friendly. No link farms or spam pages either. Applying for a job soon? Note: I can't give you the reference letter until you actually do the testing.
Like artwork? Like free shipping? Like great deals? Well, here’s one for you! My selling price for 8x10 inch paintings is $135 framed. I have two listed on my personal shop right now for exactly that price, and there’s also a shipping charge. If a few of you will help me out, I’ll paint a new 8x10, frame it, and ship it to you for only $75! You don’t have to pay shipping, and you’re getting it for $60 cheaper!
Art for all seasons. For $100 get this amazing photo set. I chose these four photos of mine to represent the four seasons. Only two sets were made. Display them all, or change them each season for your own mini one-work gallery! They’re printed at 8 inches by 10 inches (landscape) on aluminum with rounded corners. Four mounting blocks and a storage box are included! I’ll be covering the shipping.
The Gallery Tour: Maybe you really want to see the Gallery in person. It isn’t open to the public right now, but for $250 you get to visit the Whistle Stop Gallery’s Granite City home. Step inside, hear about the history of the building and what I know about the area, and about what I’m trying to do! You also get to TAKE HOME a piece of the Gallery with you! The building’s old brick, and some of it is damaged. I save the pieces, which get turned into original paintings by local artists. I’ll give it to you while you’re here. Feel free to take photos if you want, too. You also get a map of downtown points of interest, and a list of city-wide points of interest. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE YOUR TRAVEL AND LODGING; YOU MUST GET HERE ON YOUR OWN. The Gallery is located in Granite City, Illinois, 62040, USA. I’ll give you the address by email. You MUST work out a time to visit, you cannot just stop by! You may bring one guest.
The Gallery Tour - remotely: (also $250) Can’t make it to Granite City, Illinois but still want to see it? I’ll record a video tour for you and send it to you. You can also ask questions after and I’ll send you a video with responses. You also get a piece of the Gallery with an original painting on it! I’ll have to ship the art to you, so I have to limit where I can send it. Due to this being a larger contribution, I can do some (but not all) international shipping while just covering the cost. You also get the map and points of interest too, if you make it to Granite City in the future. If you don’t see your home country and want this Perk, contact me and I’ll personally check to see if it’s possible.

<p><b>Communities’ needs
and challenges</b>: The current
challenges have to do with a gross lack of technical knowledge among artisans
relating to fair trade principles. The local artisans are not finding their
share in international handicraft market because their crafts lack technical
capabilities needed to meet up international consumer societies. Lacking
technical education include: 1. economically disadvantaged in their production,
access to market and an online platform to sell their products. Hence lack
proper book keeping skills, have no idea of fair price payment, lack
sensitization on women economic empowerment and gender equity. </p>
<p><b>Impact on the

</p><p><b>Background to the project and exhibition</b></p>
<p>The exhibition will present photo documentation of the annual
art in nature laboratory, Ars Kozara, which takes place in Kozara National
Park, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It will be on display between 21st-27th April 2016 at 5th Base Gallery (23 Heneage Street, London E1 5LJ) and is a
collaboration between Tač.ka and Charlotte Whelan (PhD student, UCL), with the
help of Dominique Russell and Breana Cronk-Moore (MA Museum Studies,
UCL). </p>
<p>Initiated in 2007 by the art collective Tač.ka, who are from the
municipality in which Kozara is located, Ars Kozara invites artists from all
over the Former Yugoslavia and further afield to spend 1-2 weeks living and
working together in the national park to create artworks that engage
technically and conceptually with the space of Kozara. The London exhibition
will present photo and video documentation of the project from 2007-2015.</p>
<p>The exhibition presents a rare opportunity in the UK to see some
of the work that young artists in Bosnia and Herzegovina are doing. Ars Kozara
is not only unique in the Bosnian context but also internationally. As a
project that takes place annually at the same site, it represents a prolonged
engagement with a specific place rather than a one-off intervention that is
common in site-specific projects. The exhibition will demonstrate the evolution
of both the project and Kozara as a site transformed into an open-air gallery.
It also counteracts common misconceptions of what Bosnian art is or should be,
acting as an educational project of sorts for UK audiences.</p>
<p><b>What
we need your support for</b></p>
<p>Although the costs are relatively minimal,
there are costs that as students we can’t afford fully ourselves. Research on and
applications for alternative funding sources have been done, but most did not
fully fit the concept of the exhibition or the project. And some we are still
waiting to hear from. With such small costs to put on the exhibition, crowd
funding is, if we can achieve our goal, a more guaranteed form of funding for
us and in many ways a more positive one. The main goal is to expose as many people as possible to this unique project from Bosnia and Herzegovina, so crowd sourcing allows us to raise funds as well as spread the word. Ars<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Kozara always relies on community involvement and hopefully that collaborative approach can continue in the UK with this exhibition.  </span></p>
<p>The cost of our gallery hire will be £750
and printing the photos and other documentation will be around £400. We would
also very much like to invite Tač.ka members to be present at the exhibition. If this is possible, they will
talk about the project at the opening event and be available for some private
tours over the weekend run. We have found a fund to support the cost of airfare
and visas, but we would need some additional for transport, food and
accommodation costs (estimated £900). Finally we will need to hire audio-visual
equipment for the video works + minor contingency costs (£450). </p>
<p>We would really appreciate any donation you
can give to make this happen. If 1000 people donated only £2 we would be at our
goal. It would be a great opportunity to share this project with a wider
audience and we hope that with your support we can make it happen. </p>

<p></p></div>","Hello, I am David Schor...I have been an Internationally Collected Artist for most of the 35 years of my career as a Fine Artist. Please visit my website at:  Http://www.EmotionsInArt.com/AboutI need your help to find homes for  my animals: Cats, Dogs, Horses,  Wild Animals, and Birds.        About my Animals......    For many years, beginning in 1980, I created drawings of animals in a very distinctive style which is called ""Essential Focus"". Briefly, it consists of  creating a piece of art focusing only on the essentials of the emotion.    These drawings are created  with an extremely fine technical pen in black ink, using either minute dots or tiny lines, in many cases, I colored the eyes to enhance the emotional impact.         I then published the pen and ink drawings as Limited Edition Lithographs, signed and numbered..           These Limited Editions became extremely popular and were collected in over ten countries including the U.S.A. Many editions were completely sold out, others partially sold out and other, newer ones, just begun their journey into homes.        So what happened....?        In the 1990's, the internet, namely my website, connected individuals throughout the world with my art, particularly my original impressionistic paintings.  They responded by commissioning me to go on location to create paintings for them. My clients were from England, Norway, Australia, Germany, Italy, France, Germany. Monte Carlo, and throughout the U.S.A.      ""Crashing Waves in Tahiti""        Not a bad thing,!  But, it definitely took me away from my animals and that style of work. I could not spend any time marketing  them, other than to include them on my website.      So, there my birds, dogs, felines, etc. languished for many years without homes in the cold, impersonal security of my art vault while I have been traveled with my wife, Olga, throughout  France, Italy, Hawaii, and the U.S.A creating paintings.      What is the Project???    I am asking you to give one or more of my animals a home.       You can choose one or more that you want and I will send them to you.  Your donation to the project will enhance your home or office, give my animals a home, and relieve me of a great deal of guilt. You can select the level of your participation. As little as $15 and up to $750.  ... and here's where you come in....
    I want to make sure you understand that your contribution, at whatever level you choose, will be very appreciated. 
 You will have an opportunity to participate, in a very real way, in allowing this important aspect of my body of artistic work to be enjoyed as it was meant to be. Your rewards will arrive no matter what.  I have been a professional Artist for thirty-five years, and have always appreciated each and every client and collector . I'll be taking your support equally seriously. You will also join me on my list of collectors and, if you wish, receive periodic Newsletters concerning my art.     ...so what are the rewards???      Interested in contributing? Fantastic! I love to have you on board, and my animals will love being in your home!   So please choose your  level of contribution and Lithograph(s) or original drawing, click onto the appropriate Perk from the list, and  complete ALL necessary information.    All Perks will be shipped, unframed and unmatted in a USPS  tube, within three weeks, after the campaign ends.      Please contact me if you have any questions at: DoRealArt@Gmail.com           I need your help. Please do                             something right now....   My animals are being held captive in my Art Vault and they need  to have a home in which to be enjoyed.   It hurts me to think of all of that art of mine not doing what they were created to do....make life a bit more enjoyable for people. It really does bother me.  You can help!  Please select a Perk from those listed and click onto that Perk. I will email you to ask which of the Limited Edition Lithographs you would like me to send to you. I will also include a sincerely felt thank you for your help. You are doing a good thing and I appreciate it.         What else can you do?.....        Please forward this information to all of your friends.

Inspired by their interactions with these majestic giants in the wild, the artists will create a series of large-scale public murals on the island to help educate and raise greatly needed awareness within the local and tourist communities for the plight of these animals and the oceans. The murals will also highlight the benefits of ecotourism and long-term sustainability of natural resources. </p><p><b><i>Sea Walls: Murals for Oceans</i></b> is a new approach to ocean conservation, marrying art and activism.

By collaborating with internationally renowned artists, we create large-scale murals that focus attention on pressing environmental issues the oceans are facing.In collaboration with our friends at 1xRUN we are embarking on our biggest Sea Walls project yet. We’ve invited some of today’s biggest names in contemporary street art to join us on our first-ever Sea Walls expedition.The mission of the expedition is to offer these artists the opportunity to swim with and study endangered whale sharks and oceanic manta rays off the coast of the island of Isla Mujeres, Mexico from July 20-28, 2014. Inspired by their interactions with these majestic giants in the wild, the artists will create a series of large-scale public murals on the island to help educate and raise greatly needed awareness within the local and tourist communities for the plight of these animals and the oceans. The murals will also highlight the benefits of ecotourism and long-term sustainability of natural resources. Sea Walls: Murals for Oceans is a new approach to ocean conservation, marrying art and activism. The Sea Walls expedition will make a large impact and gain global media attention – with your help.You can help us reach our project budget of $25,000 USD to cover all project expenses. In return for your support, we are offering you an awesome selection of exciting perks to fit any budget.

Short Summary
My name is Coyoti, I am a community organizer and multimedia artist.
I am asking for the help of my friends, family, and art supporters to help us bring the Blackbird to Burning Man 2014.

The Blackbird was built in 2012.  That amazing summer we brought the bus out to Burning Man and back for the first time. 


Since then we have taken the bus to many festivals, and have made a long trail of amazing memories. This year, the desert is calling us back again.


This year, we need your help.

Cost Breakdown is as follows
$2500 (appx) in Diesel for the Journey West $2637 for maintenance shop costs before we leave$1800 Generator Rental for the Week$400 Diesel Generator Fuel
$7337.00
We are not asking for a free ride, we are just asking with the help of the great burden of cost associated with operating an art car on the playa.
The people riding out on the bus to the burn cover some of the cost but not close to all of the expenses.
None of our personal expenses are included in this breakdown
We want badly to bring the bus back to the playa and share with you. Our time bringing people on art tours and playing music for people are some of the happiest memories of our lives.

Bringing an art car to the playa is a labor of love, we spend a majority of our time working on the car, or in my case driving dead sober at 5 mph while everyone parties on the roof. At the end of the day it is honestly a sacrifice, obligation and responsibility. We love doing it! 
We love this bus and we built it to share it. 
Thank you for your support. 
   What We Need & What You Get  
We need $5000 to assist in buying fuel for the cross country journey, replacing our lighting, and purchasing materials for converting the bus into a stealth jet.  If we do not reach our entire goal, whatever money we raise will be attributed to our fuel cost first, then to lighting and materials.
By donating to our project, we will be most honored to reward you with custom Blackbird gear and special privileges on the playa to enjoy the fruits of the project you helped make a reality  
  

Impact 
The Blackbird is a shining example and representative of the East Coast. 
We are, to our knowledge, the ONLY East Coast Class 1 Sound Car at the burn to make the drive all the way across the country. Having the Blackbird at Burning Man shows to the rest of the country that there ARE incredible things happening on the east coast and that our influence in the national artistic landscape is on the rise. 
  Risks & Challenges 
Our Deadline to leave on August 16th
There is lots to be done in that time We have a schedule and workplan for getting everything done in time and our help would be extremely appreciated in getting us out there. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

what a time capsule is? Well a time capsule is a historic cache of
memorabilia specific to a time, people or place, placed with the intention that

proof. All items included in the time capsule are things gathered along the way

also items as personal notes, drawings ecc. <br/></p><p>You (and only you) will reveceive a
GPS code of where your time capsule is burried. I’m using <a href=""http://www.inreachdelorme.com/product-info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inReach satellite communicator </a>to embed location coordinates. Please take into
consideration that it has an accuracy of +/− 5 meters. This is why I’m going to bury the time capsule near an easy to spot landmark
(like an unusual tree or rock) and you’ll receive also a photo of the landmark.</p><p>
All time capsules are burried in remotely
unpopulated places, but you should still 
be aware that in time it’s possible for someone else to discover your
time capsule. So the sooner you go hunting for your time capsule the greater
the chances your 500 E are well spent.</p><p>Upon request I can e-mail you also pictures of the content, but I think it's more exciting to discover it by yourself.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/345834/files/20140203011931-time_capsule.jpg?1391419171"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>1300 E</b> - <b>all of the above perks :)</b></p><p><br/></p>

To be able to reach Indonesia by September, I need to apply for visas before leaving. In order to smooth the process I’ll use the services of local travel agencies. It smoothes the process, but also increases the expenses.This is an ideal budget. Even if I don't get fully funded, I'm determined to start my journey, once I gather the minimum of 6000 E.Let's revive the art of storytelling!This is a flexible funding campaign.  Most of the perks are deliverable before I start the journey. If for whatever reason I am not able to deliver your perk, your money will be refunded.Whatever the perk you choose, lots of love and an e-mail as proof of my gratitude.2 E - For each perk I will get a tattoo of one line (0,5/0.1"" cm). If all 5000 perks are exhausted than I'll have a 5000 lines tattoo. You are, literally, going to be a line on my skin :). For this special perk I'm going to work with another artist that will come up with the design. 5 E - Your name on the blog
is not enough? What if I write your name also on my  bike flag? Your name will be waving in the
wind across twelve countries10 E - A digital portrait of you/ of one of your friends/
of your pet ecc. done by me. I will need a photo of the subject for this. Being a flexible campaign you will receive your portrait before the campaign ends, no later than 2 weeks after you send me the picture.20 E - Thoughts from another country, maybe another continent, handwritten only for you! Personal Handwritten postcard in English sent from the journey. You can choose the country from where you want your postcard to be sent.30 E - If you want more written words choose the Personal Handwritten letter perk (it may contain little doodles), written in English, just for you. You can choose the country from where you want your letter to be sent.
*,** - travelling on bike can get messy. If for whatever reason I am not able to send you a post card or letter from the country of your choosing, than you'll be notified and you can choose . You will be notified  as soon as possible, via e-mail, after I mail them to you. Each post card/ letter is written especially for you. As proof I'll be posting pictures/ paragraph on the blog (with your previous consent)
.
45 E - Creative CV - Aren't you bored of the typical CV 
written in Word? If you are the creative type but have no skills in any 
graphic design software, then this is the perk for you. Together we'll 
come up with the best sollution for yor CV to trully represent you! 
You'll receive it in the digital format you need.Because it's a 
flexible campaign I'll start working on your CV as soon as we establish 
all the details. Delivery in maximum a month.                                             my own CV as sample50 E - An original sketch from the
trip. It all starts end ends with you! Thanks to you I 'll make the journey and I'll have the chance to doodle. Don't worry. The sketches will be more advanced than a stickman :). 
60 E - Sketchbook
inspired by Homage to the square of Joseph Alber  – 50 pg; square format 5""x5""/ 12x12 cm; Canson paper 90g/m²; shipping included. This
journey is about creativity. It is my journey in the realm of color perception.
Each sketchbook is entirely done by (my) hand: the cover is painted, the  sheets are hand cutted and everything is hand bounded. *
* if you love sketchbooks but you're not really fond of the Homage to square idea, you can choose one of these sketchbooks
70 E - A white t-shirt digitally printed with a doodle of you or a sketch
from the trip; shipping included; Details on fabric and available sizez here. Check what size fits you best.For the family package (1 man, 1 woman, 1 child) contribute 180 E. Wouldn't be nice to get the family package 
with a doodle of the entire family? The more, the merrier! For each 
additional Tshirt you contribute  50 E more.Shipping still included.80 E - Do you have an idea of a drawing but you can't put it on paper? With this perk we'll come up together with your desired illustration. Your custom drawing will be done using digital tools like Photoshop, Illustrator or Sketchbook. You'll receive it in digital format, the sizes you need and agree upon.Because it's a flexible campaign I'll start working on the drawing as soon as we establish all the details. It will be finished in maximum a month.150 E - Original painting for Art Lovers. Only 10 pieces available! Each one unique!Dimensions (Height x Width): 70 x 50 cm/ 27.5″ x 19.6″

Shipping included. The painting will be shipped between two cardboard slices, marked “Fragile shipment”

If you want to see the pictures enlarged please check out the online gallery on my blog.500 E - A time capsule 
Do you know
what a time capsule is? Well a time capsule is a historic cache of
memorabilia specific to a time, people or place, placed with the intention that
it will be opened or accessed at a future date. The container is water
proof. All items included in the time capsule are things gathered along the way
and non rotting, but
also items as personal notes, drawings ecc. You (and only you) will reveceive a
GPS code of where your time capsule is burried. I’m using inReach satellite communicator to embed location coordinates. Please take into
consideration that it has an accuracy of +/− 5 meters. This is why I’m going to bury the time capsule near an easy to spot landmark
(like an unusual tree or rock) and you’ll receive also a photo of the landmark.
All time capsules are burried in remotely
unpopulated places, but you should still 
be aware that in time it’s possible for someone else to discover your
time capsule. So the sooner you go hunting for your time capsule the greater
the chances your 500 E are well spent.Upon request I can e-mail you also pictures of the content, but I think it's more exciting to discover it by yourself.1300 E - all of the above perks :)
Most of the perks will be delivered before I start my journey, some of them even before the campaign ends.I will be traveling solo. Setbacks can arise. The blog will be updated as soons as it is possible.You can not take this kind of journey without even considering you may not get to end it. I'll communicate constantly with someone back home and, if this does happen, your money will be fully refunded for the perks non deliverable.You can also be a supporter by spreading the word about this campaign. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to do so. Any share is greatly appreciated.If you love the campaign but none of the perks catched your attention and interest maybe this other artsy stuff made by me would. All being said hope you'll take this journey with me. If you do have any question left unanswered, please feel free to write me at artsywheels@gmail.com",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>The AURA™
Breathalyzer<i> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">by Ho International Design,
Inc. </span></i>
</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Sleek,
innovative product design delivers a unique fashionable alternative and
transcends stigma.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The AURA™ Breathalyzer is a hand-held breath alcohol screening device
that utilizes electrochemical fuel cell sensor technology to analyze the
oxidation of ethanol within human breath samples. This device is intended to
provide an estimate of a test subject’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC),
based on the analysis of that subject’s breath sample. </span></p>
<h3><i>Unprecedented
style, Inspired by Chic Fashion.</i></h3>
<p>Being constantly exposed to the L.A./Hollywood nightlife
scene, we at Ho International Design Inc. (HIDI) are well aware that <i>image</i> and public<i> perception</i> have historically deterred the public and widespread
use of personal breathalyzers.</p>
<p>TO OVERCOME THIS OBSTACLE, we leveraged our background in <u>fashion</u>
and <u>product design</u> to create a chic, groundbreaking breathalyzer
specifically designed to reshape the world’s perception of responsible
celebration. </p>
<h3><i>Precision.</i></h3>
<p>In developing the 
AURA™, we understood that matching its
breathtaking aesthetics with precise technology was an <b>absolute
must</b>. We firmly believe that the critical decision to operate a vehicle after
alcohol consumption should only be aided by the <b><i>best available technology</i></b> for
the everyday consumer.</p>
<p>As such, every

AURA™ unit integrates FUEL CELL sensor technology. Compared to less expensive <i>semiconductor oxide</i> sensors, fuel cell
sensors are far and beyond the more outstanding technology, and are used in most POLICE<i> hand-held alcohol screening devices</i> and most
COURT-ISSUED <i>vehicle ignition-interlock
systems</i>.</p>

<h1>FUEL CELL
SENSOR TECHNOLOGY

</h1>
<h3>
<i>Learn why </i>YOU<i> should invest in it.</i>
</h3>
<p>All too often, we make the <i>critical</i> mistake of self-determining our
ability to safely operate a vehicle after recent alcohol consumption. While the
current blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit of 0.08% is common knowledge
(within the USA), most of us fail to realize that one’s BAC cannot be accurately
estimated without the aid of a professional breathalyzer. The fact is there are just TOO MANY VARIABLES affecting a person’s
BAC (i.e. age, weight, gender, ethnicity, liver function, amount of food
digested, other drugs/medication) for any of us to know <b><i>with certainty</i></b> 
where we stand at any
moment in time, if we were to only rely on generic BAC Charts from the DMV. Fortunately, the use of fuel cell
breathalyzers helps <i><b>reduce guesswork</b></i> and provides otherwise unattainable information. </p>
<p>While <i>semiconductor oxide</i> sensors have demonstrated the ability to detect
the <i>presence </i>of ethyl alcohol
(“ethanol”) in a person’s body, <i>fuel cell</i> sensors have proven to provide much more accurate estimates of
ethanol within a person’s breath. As such, we believe that <b>settling for second-tier
<i>semiconductor</i> sensor technology is a <i>poor</i> investment</b>. The difference in
accuracy and consistency between the two types of sensors is <i>drastic</i> and could make all the
difference in your future. </p>

<p></p>
<h3><i>Disclaimers</i></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <b>AURA</b>™ Breathalyzer is a hand-held breath alcohol screening device
that utilizes electrochemical fuel cell sensor technology to analyze the
oxidation of ethanol within human breath samples. This device is intended to
provide an estimate of a test subject’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC),
based on the analysis of that subject’s breath sample. </p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT – MUST READ</b></p>
<p>1. While there exists a
direct correlation between alcohol in the breath and alcohol in the blood, this
correlation is imperfect, and varies based on environmental factors (e.g., air
quality, wind, humidity, and temperature) and health conditions of the test
subject. As such, the exact BAC level of a test subject CANNOT be determined by
breath alcohol screening devices, including the <b>AURA</b>™ Breathalyzer. This device is NOT intended to provide the test
subject’s exact BAC level. </p>
<p>2. A BAC reading below 0.08%
from this device does not suggest or imply that the test subject cannot, or
will not, be charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. A
person may be charged with DUI even with BAC levels under 0.08%. The creators
of this device do not condone or support any level of drinking and driving. The
presence of alcohol in the blood impairs judgment, decreases physical or mental
performance, and delays reaction times, which can impair your ability to
respond to an emergency. As such, driving with any alcohol in your blood is
unsafe, and puts you at risk of a DUI. </p>
<p>3. Any act or failure to act
based on a reading from this product shall be at the test subject’s or user’s
own risk. Ho International Design, Inc. (HIDI) assumes no responsibility for
consequences to or of test subjects who use this product and later are shown to
have been under the influence of alcohol or to have had their judgment or any
mental or bodily function impaired by alcohol. HIDI expressly disclaims any
liability for direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
of any nature under any legal theory. HIDI makes no warranties, express or
implied, as to the ability of this product to determine whether, or the extent
to which, a test subject’s mental or physical functioning, or judgment, may be
impaired by alcohol including whether the test subject is intoxicated under any
definition of that word. </p>

<h3><i>Risks and Challenges</i></h3>
<p>We have identified the following risks and challenges, and have
included below our plans to overcome them.</p>CREATING AWARENESS: 
We truly believe we
have an outstanding product. We are confident that someone looking to invest in
a personal breathalyzer for themselves or others will choose ours over the
competition. However, the real challenge is getting people to understand/admit
the benefits of purchasing a personal breathalyzer. Many people unknowingly put
their futures at risk because they don’t have access to the otherwise
unattainable information gained from the use of breathalyzers. We are hopeful
that our innovative product design will increase overall awareness about the
importance of protecting themselves and others via personal breathalyzers in
general.<br/></span></span><br/>EXPERIENCE: Being young entrepreneurs, we understand that people
may challenge our overall experience and our decision to enter the breathalyzer
market. With a background in fashion and design, what do we really know about
the breathalyzer market? Well - we have done our DUE DILIGENCE through 3.5
years of extensive research, and more importantly, we have teamed with a group
of industry-leading experts in the field of fuel cell sensor technology (over
25 years of experience). Through this combination, we are confident in our
collective ability to address shortcomings related to our experience.<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">

<p>PRODUCTION CAPABILITY: <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">AURA</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">™ is already very far along in the production process. We have
arrangements in place with our manufacturers, suppliers, and our assembly team
who are capable and ready for mass production. As soon as we reach our funding
goal, we will be able to give them the ""green light"" to begin our
first production run.</span>
</p>
<p>QUALITY CONTROL: We recognize the importance of quality control in
meeting customer expectations. We have been working very closely with our
manufacturing and assembly teams to identify and propose solutions for product
shortcomings/challenges. If successfully funded, we will be directly involved
with overseeing the manufacturing process to ensure quality control.</p>
<p>USER ERROR/MISUSE: 
We are aware of certain
risks/challenges that we will not be able prevent, such as user error (i.e.
user does not blow forcefully or long enough), product misuse (i.e. users fail
to wait the suggested 15-20 minutes from last sip before use), or failure to
calibrate the <b>AURA</b>™ as needed. To
mitigate these risks, we will include clear instructions and disclaimers in
various areas to reduce user error, prevent product misuse, and communicate the
importance of timely calibration.</p>

<p><b>Q: How does the <b>AURA</b>™ Breathalyzer measure up to the Breathometer (TM), which was just featured on the popular TV show ""Shark Tank""? What are the notable differences?</b></p>
<p>A: Noteworthy<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> strengths of the <b>AURA</b>™ Breathalyzer:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Unrivaled <b>Design</b>: The <b>AURA</b>™ is incredibly sleek, fashionable, professional, and it is an entirely standalone product; it does not require a smartphone for power or function. It is discreet not only because of its small size, but also largely due to its unique ability to assimilate with other electronic devices and fashion accessories. </p>
<p><i>Breathalyzers have never been designed by (or for) those with an eye for luxury and fashion. We believe those who understand and appreciate the value of creative, fashionable design are willing to place a premium on <b>innovation</b>, attention to <b>detail</b>, brand image/<b>lifestyle</b>, and <b>exceptional customer service</b>.</i></p>
<p>2. Superior <b>Technology</b>: The <b>AURA</b>™ integrates law-enforcement grade, electrochemical fuel cell sensor technology. At a pre-order price of $49, it didn't come as a surprise that the Breathometer (TM) uses second tier, low-cost semiconductor technology. The difference in accuracy and consistency is <i>significant</i>. We believe that <b><i>compromise should never be an option when it comes to life-changing decisions.</i></b></p>
<p>3. Less Frequent <b>Calibration</b> &amp; Exceptional <b>Service</b>: The suggested number of uses before calibration is 500 for the <b>AURA</b>™, compared to 250 uses for the Breathometer (TM). Calibration services (excluding shipping costs) are typically significant ($15-25, nearly 50% of the cost of a Breathometer), so you definitely want to minimize the frequency of calibration. </p>
<p><i>For <b>AURA</b>™ owners, when you send in your device for calibration, we will also polish the stainless steel backplate and replace your screen to ensure that your unit comes back looking as sleek and stylish as it was intended to be, at NO additional cost to you.</i></p>
<p>4. Superior <b>Power Source</b>: The <b>AURA</b>™ is <i>rechargeable</i> (via Micro USB) after approximately 100 uses, while the Breathometer (TM) requires AAA batteries, which must be repurchased every 75 uses. </p>
<p>5. Wider <b>Detection Range</b>: The <b>AURA</b>™ detection range extends from 0.000% to 0.300%, compared to 0.00% to 0.20% for the Breathometer (TM).</p>

<b>Q: Why would you need this after trying it 1-2 times? Can't one remember that you're only allowed 1-3 drinks?<br/></b><p></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">A: 1. In a perfect world, everyone would stick to this simple rule: ""If you've had anything to drink at all, simply don't drink and drive."" In the real world, however, people will continue to drink and they will continue to drive. The fact is there are just TOO MANY VARIABLES affecting a person’s BAC (i.e. age, weight, gender, ethnicity, liver function, amount of food digested, other drugs/medication) for any of us to know <b><i>with certainty</i></b> whether we are under/over the limit. Fortunately, the use of fuel cell breathalyzers virtually <i><b>eliminates guesswork</b></i> and allows you to make an <i><b>informed decision</b></i> before getting behind the wheel.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">2. Professional breathalyzers do more than just determine whether you are under/over the 0.08% BAC limit, they provide a precise reading. Users can use that information to learn about how alcohol affects their body, how the aforementioned variables can affect their BAC, how their BAC compares to other people under similar conditions, and more. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">3. Almost everyone knows that driving with a BAC of 0.08% or higher will result in an automatic DUI or DWI. However, most people are surprised to find that, in many states/provinces/countries, you can be arrested for DUI or DWI while under the hard limit of 0.08%, if you are found to be significantly ""impaired"" [you cannot operate a vehicle as safely as if you were sober]. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">4.

OUR STORY
Meet the AURA
team. Learn how you can help.





The AURA™
Breathalyzer by Ho International Design,
Inc. 

Sleek,
innovative product design delivers a unique fashionable alternative and
transcends stigma.
The AURA™ Breathalyzer is a hand-held breath alcohol screening device
that utilizes electrochemical fuel cell sensor technology to analyze the
oxidation of ethanol within human breath samples. This device is intended to
provide an estimate of a test subject’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC),
based on the analysis of that subject’s breath sample. 
Unprecedented
style, Inspired by Chic Fashion.
Being constantly exposed to the L.A./Hollywood nightlife
scene, we at Ho International Design Inc. (HIDI) are well aware that image and public perception have historically deterred the public and widespread
use of personal breathalyzers.
TO OVERCOME THIS OBSTACLE, we leveraged our background in fashion
and product design to create a chic, groundbreaking breathalyzer
specifically designed to reshape the world’s perception of responsible
celebration. 
Precision.
In developing the 
AURA™, we understood that matching its
breathtaking aesthetics with precise technology was an absolute
must. We firmly believe that the critical decision to operate a vehicle after
alcohol consumption should only be aided by the best available technology for
the everyday consumer.
As such, every

AURA™ unit integrates FUEL CELL sensor technology. Compared to less expensive semiconductor oxide sensors, fuel cell
sensors are far and beyond the more outstanding technology, and are used in most POLICE hand-held alcohol screening devices and most
COURT-ISSUED vehicle ignition-interlock
systems.


FUEL CELL
SENSOR TECHNOLOGY



Learn why YOU should invest in it.

All too often, we make the critical mistake of self-determining our
ability to safely operate a vehicle after recent alcohol consumption. While the
current blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit of 0.08% is common knowledge
(within the USA), most of us fail to realize that one’s BAC cannot be accurately
estimated without the aid of a professional breathalyzer. The fact is there are just TOO MANY VARIABLES affecting a person’s
BAC (i.e. age, weight, gender, ethnicity, liver function, amount of food
digested, other drugs/medication) for any of us to know with certainty 
where we stand at any
moment in time, if we were to only rely on generic BAC Charts from the DMV. Fortunately, the use of fuel cell
breathalyzers helps reduce guesswork and provides otherwise unattainable information. 
While semiconductor oxide sensors have demonstrated the ability to detect
the presence of ethyl alcohol
(“ethanol”) in a person’s body, fuel cell sensors have proven to provide much more accurate estimates of
ethanol within a person’s breath. As such, we believe that settling for second-tier
semiconductor sensor technology is a poor investment. The difference in
accuracy and consistency between the two types of sensors is drastic and could make all the
difference in your future.

Disclaimers



The AURA™ Breathalyzer is a hand-held breath alcohol screening device
that utilizes electrochemical fuel cell sensor technology to analyze the
oxidation of ethanol within human breath samples. This device is intended to
provide an estimate of a test subject’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC),
based on the analysis of that subject’s breath sample. 
IMPORTANT – MUST READ
1. While there exists a
direct correlation between alcohol in the breath and alcohol in the blood, this
correlation is imperfect, and varies based on environmental factors (e.g., air
quality, wind, humidity, and temperature) and health conditions of the test
subject. As such, the exact BAC level of a test subject CANNOT be determined by
breath alcohol screening devices, including the AURA™ Breathalyzer. This device is NOT intended to provide the test
subject’s exact BAC level. 
2. A BAC reading below 0.08%
from this device does not suggest or imply that the test subject cannot, or
will not, be charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. A
person may be charged with DUI even with BAC levels under 0.08%. The creators
of this device do not condone or support any level of drinking and driving. The
presence of alcohol in the blood impairs judgment, decreases physical or mental
performance, and delays reaction times, which can impair your ability to
respond to an emergency. As such, driving with any alcohol in your blood is
unsafe, and puts you at risk of a DUI. 
3. Any act or failure to act
based on a reading from this product shall be at the test subject’s or user’s
own risk. Ho International Design, Inc. (HIDI) assumes no responsibility for
consequences to or of test subjects who use this product and later are shown to
have been under the influence of alcohol or to have had their judgment or any
mental or bodily function impaired by alcohol. HIDI expressly disclaims any
liability for direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
of any nature under any legal theory. HIDI makes no warranties, express or
implied, as to the ability of this product to determine whether, or the extent
to which, a test subject’s mental or physical functioning, or judgment, may be
impaired by alcohol including whether the test subject is intoxicated under any
definition of that word. 


About Us
Ho International Design Inc. (HIDI) was founded in 2012 by
Christopher Ho and Christopher Surapol, two young entrepreneurs who share a
vision of changing perception through design. 
Christopher Ho began his higher education at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After a year at UCLA, he transferred to the
globally-recognized Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (FIDM) to
pursue his true passion as a designer and visionary. In addition to an
Associate's degree from FIDM, his background in fashion includes working
closely with world-renowned David Chu (founder of Nautica clothing brand) and
at William Rast (Justin Timberlake's clothing brand). It was at the latter
where he met and learned from Trish Rae, former designer for William Rast and
current denim designer for 7 For All Mankind. Together, Chris and Trish created
the groundbreaking AURA design you see today.
Christopher Surapol completed his Bachelor's degree in Economics
from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and earned his Master's
degree in Accounting from the University of Southern California (USC). He is a
certified public accountant (CPA) and a former employee of Deloitte & Touche
LLP, one of the world's largest ""Big 4"" accounting firms. After
several years of developing his expertise in business and accounting at
Deloitte, he joined HIDI to help turn the AURA idea into a reality.
Risks and Challenges
We have identified the following risks and challenges, and have
included below our plans to overcome them.CREATING AWARENESS: 
We truly believe we
have an outstanding product. We are confident that someone looking to invest in
a personal breathalyzer for themselves or others will choose ours over the
competition. However, the real challenge is getting people to understand/admit
the benefits of purchasing a personal breathalyzer. Many people unknowingly put
their futures at risk because they don’t have access to the otherwise
unattainable information gained from the use of breathalyzers. We are hopeful
that our innovative product design will increase overall awareness about the
importance of protecting themselves and others via personal breathalyzers in
general.EXPERIENCE: Being young entrepreneurs, we understand that people
may challenge our overall experience and our decision to enter the breathalyzer
market. With a background in fashion and design, what do we really know about
the breathalyzer market? Well - we have done our DUE DILIGENCE through 3.5
years of extensive research, and more importantly, we have teamed with a group
of industry-leading experts in the field of fuel cell sensor technology (over
25 years of experience). Through this combination, we are confident in our
collective ability to address shortcomings related to our experience.

PRODUCTION CAPABILITY: The AURA™ is already very far along in the production process. We have
arrangements in place with our manufacturers, suppliers, and our assembly team
who are capable and ready for mass production. As soon as we reach our funding
goal, we will be able to give them the ""green light"" to begin our
first production run.

QUALITY CONTROL: We recognize the importance of quality control in
meeting customer expectations. We have been working very closely with our
manufacturing and assembly teams to identify and propose solutions for product
shortcomings/challenges. If successfully funded, we will be directly involved
with overseeing the manufacturing process to ensure quality control.
USER ERROR/MISUSE: 
We are aware of certain
risks/challenges that we will not be able prevent, such as user error (i.e.
user does not blow forcefully or long enough), product misuse (i.e. users fail
to wait the suggested 15-20 minutes from last sip before use), or failure to
calibrate the AURA™ as needed. To
mitigate these risks, we will include clear instructions and disclaimers in
various areas to reduce user error, prevent product misuse, and communicate the
importance of timely calibration.
Estimated Timeline

October 2013: End of
     funding period. 1st production run begins. 
November 2013: 1st
     production run completed, and assembly
     of 1st production run units begins; 2nd production run begins (if demand
     exists).

A: We suggest that the AURA™ be calibrated after 500 uses, or
once per year, whichever comes first. Like all breathalyzers, accuracy can only
be maintained through timely professional calibration. We will offer this
service for approximately $25, while including complimentary replacement of the
polycarbonate screen and polishing of the stainless steel back plate, so that
your unit comes back looking as sleek and stylish as it was intended. 
Q: Where will I need to ship my AURA unit for recalibration?


A: Before the unit is
delivered, we will provide the proper addresses for our recalibration/service
centers. We plan to finalize the logistics prior to our delivery dates (December). 
Q: Will any OFFICIAL FILTERS be included with each purchase? What will they look like?


A: Yes, we will include 2
complimentary filters (mouthpieces) for each AURA™ unit you order. Additional filters (mouthpieces) will be
available for purchase as accessories.
Q: Are filters necessary or is it a matter of personal preference? Are filters disposable or can they be cleaned and reused?

A: The decision to use a
filter (mouthpiece) generally depends on whether or not you will be sharing the
AURA™ with friends/family. Even
then, it is a matter of personal preference. Some people are more
hygiene-conscious than others, and as such, we have provided a solution. Our
filters can easily be cleaned and reused.

Q: What does the OFFICIAL POUCH look like?
A: Please see the ""Gallery"" tab, where we have added 2 photos of our samples per your request. Note that the final product will look much nicer as the material used will be Suede, as opposed to Velvet (shown for sample purposes only).

4. Superior Power Source: The AURA™ is rechargeable (via Micro USB) after approximately 100 uses, while the Breathometer (TM) requires AAA batteries, which must be repurchased every 75 uses. 
5. Wider Detection Range: The AURA™ detection range extends from 0.000% to 0.300%, compared to 0.00% to 0.20% for the Breathometer (TM).
NOTE: Information regarding Breathometer (TM) was taken directly from their website at http://breathometer.com/tech-specs)

Q: Why would you need this after trying it 1-2 times? Can't one remember that you're only allowed 1-3 drinks?
A: 1. In a perfect world, everyone would stick to this simple rule: ""If you've had anything to drink at all, simply don't drink and drive."" In the real world, however, people will continue to drink and they will continue to drive. The fact is there are just TOO MANY VARIABLES affecting a person’s BAC (i.e. age, weight, gender, ethnicity, liver function, amount of food digested, other drugs/medication) for any of us to know with certainty whether we are under/over the limit. Fortunately, the use of fuel cell breathalyzers virtually eliminates guesswork and allows you to make an informed decision before getting behind the wheel.
2. Professional breathalyzers do more than just determine whether you are under/over the 0.08% BAC limit, they provide a precise reading. Users can use that information to learn about how alcohol affects their body, how the aforementioned variables can affect their BAC, how their BAC compares to other people under similar conditions, and more. 
3. Almost everyone knows that driving with a BAC of 0.08% or higher will result in an automatic DUI or DWI. However, most people are surprised to find that, in many states/provinces/countries, you can be arrested for DUI or DWI while under the hard limit of 0.08%, if you are found to be significantly ""impaired"" [you cannot operate a vehicle as safely as if you were sober]. 
4. There is a reason why the breathalyzer market is valued in the hundreds of millions (USD). For more information, check out: http://wintergreenresearch.com/reports/breath_analyzer.htm
5. We understand our product, along with any breathalyzer, is not a perfect preventative measure to counteract drunk driving. We know that not everyone will agree with our approach and many will think it is ""ineffective"" in terms of % of lives saved per use/sale. However, our founders would like to point out and reiterate the fact that even one life saved is a tremendous and worthwhile success. To us, that is immeasurable. 
Much more than professional breathalyzer, AURA™ provides a fashionable alternative to existing models with the unique ability to remove negative stigma. By changing perception through design, AURA's mission is to promote preventative measures against drunk driving and life-changing DUI offenses.

<h3>Welcome </h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Tammie Bowden and I am a motivated and inspired independent artist looking to expand my medium into the world of design starting with a simple clothing and fabric business of my own.  Nothing too flashy here folks...just a foot in the door towards getting my work seen on fabrics for manchester and bedding and on clothing such as t-shirts, tank tops, hoodies, track pants and tops, caps and underwear .  I have had some interest from some successful designers who already have clothing ranges of their own but I just dont have the funds to come up with the samples that they want to see before they will give me a start and after having raised five children whilst scratching a living from home, I have decided that its my time to shine!!</li>
<li>I have recently begun designing tattoos for people and thought I would expand that into tattoo styled designs for those people who cant quite bring themselves to put a tattoo on their body and like to mix up their artwork.  I am also in the process of designing a couple of character based ranges to cater to the ranges of some of the designers who are already expressing an interest.</li>
<li>The magnitude of this endeavour is perceptual.  To some, what I am wanting to do will be redefining and transcendental as they set their own style.  To others it may just be a passing phase.  For myself and my family however, this will be the start of a long yearned for journey as I launch myself full time into doing something that I am really passionate about and my children get to see that dreams really can come true!!</li>
<li>Once established I hope to be able to offer other struggling artists the opportunity to bring their designing dreams to life also both with me and on their own via scholarships and grants.   </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>I am hoping for $10,000 to enable me to obtain copyrighting, purchase design equipment so that I can continue to produce new and better drawings.  </li>
<li>I also want to be able to purchase a stockpile of my initial range so that I have them ready to send out when people order them as currently I am having to order as I get the numbers which leaves some people waiting too long, potentially affecting customer service.  </li>
<li>I need to have samples made up for designers who have expressed interest in having me design ranges exclusively for them and this means small numbers of each design which costs more to produce but which must be done if I want my work to be considered.  </li>
<li>I then need the funds to be able to post or freight these samples to their destinations.</li>
<li>Finally I need to be able to advertise what I do and what I have to offer and so I need to have a budget for that.</li>
<li>In return for your support I am happy to provide you with clothing and original artworks that are appropriate to your level of pledge or even with a Spiritual Tarot Reading if you are that way inclined as I have been working successfully in that industry for over 15 years and have satisfied clients all over the world.  </li>
<li>If I dont reach my goal I still plan to do all of the things that I have outlined above with whatever monies I do raise and will continue to work towards making my dreams into a reality.  </li>

<li>Pledgers will see my products being advertised and coming out into the market place and if I am able to land a contract with one of the companies I am pitching to then they will be informed about that too.  I will try to keep track of anyone who donates to let them know how things are going and they will belong to a ""club"" that will receive ongoing limited edition products, samples and perks that other people dont get just for having believed in me when all of this was not much more than a dream!!  This is in addition to receiving their perks for donating.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding any kind of an art project is too often an uphill climb and for women especially it is no picnic.  I want all women and girls around the world (not to mention my own daughters and sisters and nieces) to see that these things can be done however and to empower other women my age (almost 44) to keep on following their dreams and showing what they can do even when much of the world at large considers them to be over the hill.  It is not a pipe dream.  I can do it...with your help. :)  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>The Wild Galleries and Festival Show Grounds</h3>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>ABOUT US:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My name is Dale Lessard owner of The Wild Galleries and Festival Show Grounds.  I have been passionately involved in the Arts and Crafts for over 25 Years.  When I first became involved in this business I was a certified Master Framer.  I began to delve into buying, framing and selling the works of many true artists from around the country. Starting with framing in my home, shortly afterwards I began hitting the road at Arts and Craft Festivals all over the country.  I developed several long term relationships with artist and craftsmen from coast to coast and it was an honor to be asked by so many of them to frame and sell their works. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Years later I opened a very successful Art Gallery on Lake Okoboji in North-western Iowa where I continued buying, framing and selling true art.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I longed to return to my home state of Minnesota and decided to search for my dream. In the process of looking for another location to have a boutique styled Art Gallery, I was looking at a storefront in a little town just 30 minutes North of the Minneapolis St.Paul (Twin Cities Metro Area) called Isanti.  The real estate company handling the property was just 3 miles south of town. I went in to negotiate terms on the store-front property and explained my desires to the agent. The agent then mentioned that the very building we were sitting in and the surrounding 12 acres was up for sale.  I had to pinch myself as I looked around at the beautiful 4000 sq ft custom built home that had been transformed into a real estate office... and the surrounding wooded grounds and prairie land was spectacular.  I could see there would be a lot of work in cleaning up the storm fallen trees and overgrowth but I could literally see my dream coming true.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After a a couple of short months, investing a vast majority of my savings, I was now the proud owner of this place.  By December of 2012 I opened the doors to what is now fondly known as ""The Wild Galleries"".  With my history in the arts and crafts world and my involvement in festival shows around the country... the potential of this property and what it can mean to not just me, but to my fellow artists and craftsmen, the local community and surrounding region was within my ability to create.  I have begun the journey of what I have always dreamed of for years...  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">One of the most profound things I learned over the years is the love these people have in pouring out their hearts and souls as they produce magnificent works of art and crafts, and no matter where I would go they were just as dedicated to creating things that people will cherish for life and pass those creations on to their loved ones.  They are truly gifted and talented people who add so much beauty to our culture... it is not an easy life at times, but a rewarding one when they persevere through the hard times.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">There is one thing that I have witnessed and experienced over the years that really upsets me the most... That is something that is being lost and has become a cancer that is eating up many professional artisans.  It is being done at an alarming rate that has affected not only the artists and craftsmen, but also is a complete injustice to the consumer.  Many festivals have been infiltrated by those who think it is okay to take your hard earned dollars by selling you something that is deemed an art or craft product, but really was mass produced and most often made in a foreign country. When art lovers search out to buy genuine arts and crafts, the last thing they want is to be taken advantage of by someone with an ulterior motive and purchase something far less valuable than something that is authentically hand-made and of intrinsic value. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Wild Galleries is not such a place.  We screen every artisan that wants to be a part of what we are doing here before they are offered a presence within the galleries or festivals or both.  Their work must be original, created by their hand and must be of artistic quality and value.  After 25 years in this profession we know what to look for.  We redirect the phony (Buy Sell) artists to sell their wares in flea markets.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The goal of The Wild Galleries and Festival Showgrounds is to bring back to the Arts and Crafts World what is being lost.  We are a place where genuine artist and craftsmen can come to share with our community, our region and to the world, their passionate love of what they produce. A place they can call home.  A place where the art lover can come and find what they are looking for... true arts and crafts.  In the near future, a place where those interested in learning how to create works of art with their own hands, while partaking in educational programs that are under </span>development, such as ceramics, stain-glass, painting, and drawing classes etc... </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>WHAT DO WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH YOUR SUPPORT:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Not only do we have a vision for the Artisans and Consumers, we want this to be a place that is vital to the local and surrounding communities as well. We have begun clearing out the storm-fallen trees and overgrowth within many lanes of towering pines which is only about 40% completed.  Our goal is to remain conscious of the resident wildlife that traverse in and out of the bordering Athens State Wildlife Management Area, in how we continue clearing what is left.  There will be plenty of woodland areas that will remain untouched and conducive to the local deer, small game, birds and waterfowl populations.   Your support will help us to maintain the entire grounds in a ""Park Like"" setting that will make this a ""Premier Arts and Crafts Festival Show Grounds"" and Community happenings place. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are inviting local area schools to bring their performing arts such as dramas,plays, musicals and concerts to our showgrounds stage area during our ""Summer Theaters"". We are also organizing the local and regional farmers to bring their produce to our Thursdays Farmers Market during the harvest seasons.  Another goal of ours is to provide all of the amenities for those desiring to be joined together in marriage.  What an ideal place to host weddings.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>

We received high praises from the leaders of our community with comments such as ""Great Job, we love what you are doing here..!"", and ""Thank you for bringing this kind of place to our community...!"" and ""What a beautiful place you have started here...!""<p></p>
<p>The Athens Township Board also unanimously approved our permits for the Gallery, the Art Festival Show Grounds and our plans for adding on to the Gallery facility, an ""Internet Cafe"" styled Coffee Shop.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>

ABOUT US:
My name is Dale Lessard owner of The Wild Galleries and Festival Show Grounds.  I have been passionately involved in the Arts and Crafts for over 25 Years.  When I first became involved in this business I was a certified Master Framer.  I began to delve into buying, framing and selling the works of many true artists from around the country. Starting with framing in my home, shortly afterwards I began hitting the road at Arts and Craft Festivals all over the country.  I developed several long term relationships with artist and craftsmen from coast to coast and it was an honor to be asked by so many of them to frame and sell their works. Years later I opened a very successful Art Gallery on Lake Okoboji in North-western Iowa where I continued buying, framing and selling true art.
I longed to return to my home state of Minnesota and decided to search for my dream. In the process of looking for another location to have a boutique styled Art Gallery, I was looking at a storefront in a little town just 30 minutes North of the Minneapolis St.Paul (Twin Cities Metro Area) called Isanti.  The real estate company handling the property was just 3 miles south of town. I went in to negotiate terms on the store-front property and explained my desires to the agent. The agent then mentioned that the very building we were sitting in and the surrounding 12 acres was up for sale.  I had to pinch myself as I looked around at the beautiful 4000 sq ft custom built home that had been transformed into a real estate office... and the surrounding wooded grounds and prairie land was spectacular.  I could see there would be a lot of work in cleaning up the storm fallen trees and overgrowth but I could literally see my dream coming true.
After a a couple of short months, investing a vast majority of my savings, I was now the proud owner of this place.  By December of 2012 I opened the doors to what is now fondly known as ""The Wild Galleries"".  With my history in the arts and crafts world and my involvement in festival shows around the country... the potential of this property and what it can mean to not just me, but to my fellow artists and craftsmen, the local community and surrounding region was within my ability to create.  I have begun the journey of what I have always dreamed of for years...  

WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE:
One of the most profound things I learned over the years is the love these people have in pouring out their hearts and souls as they produce magnificent works of art and crafts, and no matter where I would go they were just as dedicated to creating things that people will cherish for life and pass those creations on to their loved ones.  They are truly gifted and talented people who add so much beauty to our culture... it is not an easy life at times, but a rewarding one when they persevere through the hard times.
There is one thing that I have witnessed and experienced over the years that really upsets me the most... That is something that is being lost and has become a cancer that is eating up many professional artisans.  It is being done at an alarming rate that has affected not only the artists and craftsmen, but also is a complete injustice to the consumer.  Many festivals have been infiltrated by those who think it is okay to take your hard earned dollars by selling you something that is deemed an art or craft product, but really was mass produced and most often made in a foreign country. When art lovers search out to buy genuine arts and crafts, the last thing they want is to be taken advantage of by someone with an ulterior motive and purchase something far less valuable than something that is authentically hand-made and of intrinsic value. 
The Wild Galleries is not such a place.  We screen every artisan that wants to be a part of what we are doing here before they are offered a presence within the galleries or festivals or both.  Their work must be original, created by their hand and must be of artistic quality and value.  After 25 years in this profession we know what to look for.  We redirect the phony (Buy Sell) artists to sell their wares in flea markets.
The goal of The Wild Galleries and Festival Showgrounds is to bring back to the Arts and Crafts World what is being lost.  We are a place where genuine artist and craftsmen can come to share with our community, our region and to the world, their passionate love of what they produce. A place they can call home.  A place where the art lover can come and find what they are looking for... true arts and crafts.  In the near future, a place where those interested in learning how to create works of art with their own hands, while partaking in educational programs that are under development, such as ceramics, stain-glass, painting, and drawing classes etc... 

WHAT DO WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH YOUR SUPPORT:
Not only do we have a vision for the Artisans and Consumers, we want this to be a place that is vital to the local and surrounding communities as well. We have begun clearing out the storm-fallen trees and overgrowth within many lanes of towering pines which is only about 40% completed.  Our goal is to remain conscious of the resident wildlife that traverse in and out of the bordering Athens State Wildlife Management Area, in how we continue clearing what is left.  There will be plenty of woodland areas that will remain untouched and conducive to the local deer, small game, birds and waterfowl populations.   Your support will help us to maintain the entire grounds in a ""Park Like"" setting that will make this a ""Premier Arts and Crafts Festival Show Grounds"" and Community happenings place. 
We are inviting local area schools to bring their performing arts such as dramas,plays, musicals and concerts to our showgrounds stage area during our ""Summer Theaters"". We are also organizing the local and regional farmers to bring their produce to our Thursdays Farmers Market during the harvest seasons.  Another goal of ours is to provide all of the amenities for those desiring to be joined together in marriage.  What an ideal place to host weddings.


Current Community Support:

Several members of the the Athens Township Board have personally toured the Wild Galleries and attended the 3 Art Festivals held our first year in business. We received high praises from the leaders of our community with comments such as ""Great Job, we love what you are doing here..!"", and ""Thank you for bringing this kind of place to our community...!"" and ""What a beautiful place you have started here...!""
The Athens Township Board also unanimously approved our permits for the Gallery, the Art Festival Show Grounds and our plans for adding on to the Gallery facility, an ""Internet Cafe"" styled Coffee Shop.

<h3>From Sea to See</h3>
<p>Not-for-profit organization Terra Nova Art Foundation is raising money to mount an exhibition of the work of Newfoundland artists Peter Wilkins and Will Gill at the most celebrated international art exhibition in the world: The 2013 Venice Biennale. We were overjoyed to receive word in late February that our application to exhibit work was successful. Since then we have been working hard to raise money and figure out the myriad of logistical details to make this happen. It has been a wild two months.</p>
<p>Newfoundland, Canada is one of the most magical places in the world – an island in the North Atlantic home to a wonderfully distinct people, a vast wilderness and the most easterly point of land in all of North America. The ocean brings us icebergs in the spring and humpback whales in the summer. Imagine. It is an inspiring place to make art. Making an art career here has its challenges however due mainly to the small population base, that’s why we are looking beyond our borders to allow our artists to share what they do with the world and at the same time allowing our artists to see what is happening in artistic communities elsewhere. This is how your support will make a huge difference to that end: Will and Peters work will be exposed to the hundreds of curators, collectors, writers and art professionals that attend this event every two years. They will have a chance to meet some of the most recognized artists practicing in the world today. Artists from at least 89 countries participate in the Biennale and attendance figures routinely top 400,000 over the 5 month course of the exhibition.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence. The exhibition opens on the Grand Canal on May 29th, 2013 and runs until early November.</p>
<p>Will Gill is a multi disciplinary artist who works in sculpture, painting, photography and video. His work can be viewed at <a href=""http://www.williamgill.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.williamgill.ca</a></p>
<p>Peter Wilkins is an artist who works primarily in photography and video. His work can be viewed at <a href=""http://www.wilkins.ws"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wilkins.ws</a></p>
<p>The Terra Nova Art Foundation is a registered not-for-profit organization based in St John's Newfoundland. It was formed in 2012 with the sole purpose of showcasing Newfoundland and Labrador artists on the international stage. More about the foundation can be found at <a href=""http://www.tnaf.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tnaf.ca</a></p>
<h3>What are our costs?</h3>
<p>This is an ambitious project but we feel it is hugely important and we are deeply committed to it. The cost of mounting an exhibition in one of the worlds most expensive cities is daunting to say the least. The cost of renting our gallery space for a 5 month period on the Grand Canal (Galleria Ca’ Rezzonico) and the considerable cost of the entrance and marketing fee to The Venice Biennale Organizers will exceed 100,000 Canadian Dollars. Over and above that there is the cost of crating and shipping the work to Italy, staffing the gallery for a 5 month period, printing a small brochure, costs of the opening reception, flights and accommodations for the curators of the exhibition and the artists. There are potentially more unforeseen costs. No matter which way you look at it, its super expensive, but we know it is a project that we will be reaping the rewards from for many years to come.</p>
<p>We have managed to raise approximately two thirds of our costs. One of our challenges has been that the Terra Nova Art Foundation does not yet have charitable status. We are currently not-for-profit status. That has hindered donations somewhat because we cannot issue charitable tax receipts. But in a short period we have still managed to raise a good deal of money mainly through private donations and small grants. WE ARE ALMOST THERE! Your help will make the difference down the stretch!</p>
<p>Your donation will help towards the most sizeable expense we have : the rental of the gallery space. Any money raised over and above the goal of the campaign will help to offset the out-of-pocket expenses that the artists will incur like their flights, accommodations and shipping of work.</p>
<p>All funds (partial or full) that are generated from this campaign will go directly to The Terra Nova Art Foundation with the sole purpose of exhibiting Will and Peters work at The Venice Biennale.</p>
<p>Please have a look at some of the awesome perks up for offer. <strong>In the gallery section you will find images of the photographic works for the 125$, 250$ and 1000$ categories.</strong></p>

<br/><br/>Ecstasy of a Cripple Part II: WE ARE THE CURE</p></strong></h2>
<p align=""LEFT""><strong>""WE ARE THE CURE""</strong> is the second collaboration between model/poet/mystic Jocelyn Woods and photographer/artist Thomas Dodd. We will be creating a series of images that promote the dynamic empowerment of authentic self-expression, in its capacity to catalyze a cure that reveals incorruptible wholeness.</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">""Anaïs Nin meets Teresa of Avila.""</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">--Fiona Daly, psychotherapist and Tantric facilitator</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">""Jocelyn Woods is a Mystical Erotic Visionary. Once you have glimpsed her rapturous art and divine poetry, you will be changed forever!""</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">--Kama Keshish, erotic revolutionary</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">""This looks as if it belongs in the Sistine Chapel...""</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">-- Kim Waldrep Evon, artist</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Jocelyn Woods is 27 year-old a model/poet/mystic from Cambridge, Vermont, born with a severe, rare and atypical neuromuscular disease. Unable to stand or walk, she is ignited with a ceaseless passion to share her unusual ""ecstasy"" with her brothers and sisters. Thomas Dodd is an Atlanta-based artist/photographer who creates painterly photographs in the traditions of the Old Masters, often portraying the bardic juxtaposition of life and death. Jocelyn and Thomas began their convergence in 2012, releasing Part I of <em>Ecstasy of a Cripple: the Resurrection of Passion</em>, a series of images geared towards shattering limiting paradigms surrounding disability, sexuality and immortality. <em>Part II: WE ARE THE CURE </em>shall reunite them this summer of 2013.</p>
<h2 align=""LEFT""><strong>Ecstasy and Incorruptibility: the Love Affair</strong></h2>
<p> <img alt='""Ecstasy of a Cripple"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd' class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://img3.etsystatic.com/014/0/7941941/il_fullxfull.438697867_4ucs.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title='""Ecstasy of a Cripple"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd'/></p>
<p><em>""Ecstasy of a Cripple"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT"">While her experiences of ecstatic union with the divine have been compared to Saint Teresa of Avila, Jocelyn says that ""Unhindered by the heavy chains of belief systems which deny and condemn the body as a corrupt condition of sin allows one to enter a rapture beyond the iconic saintly portrayals eulogized in history. To realize the body and soul are but inseparable components, facilitates the alchemical recipe of resurrected immortal flesh. Resurrection is not the product of conditions, but the removal of belief that imposes the conditions of decay and strife, rendering us re-membered of our natural state. It is a passionate love affair, both intensely ferocious--untamed, even feral--and the silence of a peace that passeth understanding, which characterizes incorruptible matter.""</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Jocelyn's proposition of immortality may seem preposterously outlandish, a hysterical fancy of offset wits, yet it is this very ""mad lucidity"" that Jocelyn says facilitates the breakthrough from linear mind to effortless genius. Deeply inspired by the leading mystic of the world, Almine, whom Jocelyn describes as ""a teacher whom is not the Other, but speaks as though from within my infinite self in a way that I cannot help but overwhelmingly recognize as the Voice of the Mother,"" she studies the esoteric science behind immortal mastery, and along with her fellow students, is a living example of the miracles thereof. With such testimonies ranging from food and breath being ""optional, but not required to survive"" to transcriptions from ancient Lemurian, Atlantean and other records, Almine and her students frequently report raptures that go beyond ordinary comprehension.</p>
<p align=""LEFT""><img alt='""Ascension"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd' class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://img1.etsystatic.com/011/0/7941941/il_fullxfull.438700213_psmy.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title='""Ascension"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd'/></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>""Ascension"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Yet it is not in anecdotal reports or research alone that Jocelyn bases her firey summoning to her brothers and sisters, but from actual experiences facilitated--ironically enough--by exploration of her neuromuscular disease. In a recent interview with David Bollt, CEO of ModelSociety.com, she says:</p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em><strong>To hang suspended between life and death</strong> can at first be interpreted as a sensation of indescribable heaviness and tension. I have been hung there multiple times, in suffering illnesses, and felt as though I was the burden of flesh hungrily craved by two opposite starving worlds.</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>Yet it became apparent to me that the dilemma of choosing between the land of the dead or the land of the living only remains a crisis so long as we presuppose the law that only one can be chosen of the two.</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>In reality they are but mirroring dreams. Upon which shall we shine the flashlight of awareness? It was in beholding the unreality of both dreams that I made the lucid decision to combine two disintegrated parts into remembered wholeness: only then could neither side of the mirror claim me as currency. In the resolution of soul and body one becomes a resurrected being. Upon convalescence from a dangerous respiratory infection I found that the body is most malleable when it is healing. Furthermore, in releasing identification with either the soul or body as disintegrate and tyrannical isolated segments (inaccurate bifurcation causing distortion and externalization), it is remembered as an incorruptible, fluidly renewing field, contrary to the belief that matter is immutable solidity.</em></p>
<h3 align=""LEFT""><em>It was the sensation of this fluidity that inspired me to begin using the body as an artistic medium in itself. When I model, I feel the body shape-shifting to express the emotive attitude or state of consciousness. The body is an absolutely limitless, living work of art that embodies the disrobed self-recognition of divine perfection.</em></h3>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>Billions of dollars are ushered into pharmaceutical research, and relatively minuscule attention is invested into enhancing the quality of life of those living with diseases. <strong>The message encoded in the manifestation of disease can never be heard this way. Disease is merely an unsung song. Full expression restores incorruptibility.</strong> Soul has virtually gone bankrupt in disenfranchised suppression, selling out to the belief systems that promulgate and peddle the artificial reality of perceived solidity and fatalism. At the benefit of a </em><em>contrived segregation (yielding the illusion of control), soul and body are antagonistically opposed game pawns and Passion has lain dead. Pornography is the result of the core disempowerment of humankind caused by suppression of authentic sexuality. The images for this series were inspired to catalyze </em>Ecstasy of a Cripple Part I: the Resurrection of Passion<em>, the joining of seemingly diametrically opposed poles in fertile embrace.

Ecstasy of a Cripple Part II: WE ARE THE CURE
""WE ARE THE CURE"" is the second collaboration between model/poet/mystic Jocelyn Woods and photographer/artist Thomas Dodd. We will be creating a series of images that promote the dynamic empowerment of authentic self-expression, in its capacity to catalyze a cure that reveals incorruptible wholeness.
""Anaïs Nin meets Teresa of Avila.""
--Fiona Daly, psychotherapist and Tantric facilitator
""Jocelyn Woods is a Mystical Erotic Visionary. Once you have glimpsed her rapturous art and divine poetry, you will be changed forever!""
--Kama Keshish, erotic revolutionary
""This looks as if it belongs in the Sistine Chapel...""
-- Kim Waldrep Evon, artist
Jocelyn Woods is 27 year-old a model/poet/mystic from Cambridge, Vermont, born with a severe, rare and atypical neuromuscular disease. Unable to stand or walk, she is ignited with a ceaseless passion to share her unusual ""ecstasy"" with her brothers and sisters. Thomas Dodd is an Atlanta-based artist/photographer who creates painterly photographs in the traditions of the Old Masters, often portraying the bardic juxtaposition of life and death. Jocelyn and Thomas began their convergence in 2012, releasing Part I of Ecstasy of a Cripple: the Resurrection of Passion, a series of images geared towards shattering limiting paradigms surrounding disability, sexuality and immortality. Part II: WE ARE THE CURE shall reunite them this summer of 2013.
Ecstasy and Incorruptibility: the Love Affair
 
""Ecstasy of a Cripple"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd
While her experiences of ecstatic union with the divine have been compared to Saint Teresa of Avila, Jocelyn says that ""Unhindered by the heavy chains of belief systems which deny and condemn the body as a corrupt condition of sin allows one to enter a rapture beyond the iconic saintly portrayals eulogized in history. To realize the body and soul are but inseparable components, facilitates the alchemical recipe of resurrected immortal flesh. Resurrection is not the product of conditions, but the removal of belief that imposes the conditions of decay and strife, rendering us re-membered of our natural state. It is a passionate love affair, both intensely ferocious--untamed, even feral--and the silence of a peace that passeth understanding, which characterizes incorruptible matter.""
Jocelyn's proposition of immortality may seem preposterously outlandish, a hysterical fancy of offset wits, yet it is this very ""mad lucidity"" that Jocelyn says facilitates the breakthrough from linear mind to effortless genius. Deeply inspired by the leading mystic of the world, Almine, whom Jocelyn describes as ""a teacher whom is not the Other, but speaks as though from within my infinite self in a way that I cannot help but overwhelmingly recognize as the Voice of the Mother,"" she studies the esoteric science behind immortal mastery, and along with her fellow students, is a living example of the miracles thereof. With such testimonies ranging from food and breath being ""optional, but not required to survive"" to transcriptions from ancient Lemurian, Atlantean and other records, Almine and her students frequently report raptures that go beyond ordinary comprehension.

""Ascension"" © 2013 Thomas Dodd
Yet it is not in anecdotal reports or research alone that Jocelyn bases her firey summoning to her brothers and sisters, but from actual experiences facilitated--ironically enough--by exploration of her neuromuscular disease. In a recent interview with David Bollt, CEO of ModelSociety.com, she says:
To hang suspended between life and death can at first be interpreted as a sensation of indescribable heaviness and tension. I have been hung there multiple times, in suffering illnesses, and felt as though I was the burden of flesh hungrily craved by two opposite starving worlds.
Yet it became apparent to me that the dilemma of choosing between the land of the dead or the land of the living only remains a crisis so long as we presuppose the law that only one can be chosen of the two.
In reality they are but mirroring dreams. Upon which shall we shine the flashlight of awareness? It was in beholding the unreality of both dreams that I made the lucid decision to combine two disintegrated parts into remembered wholeness: only then could neither side of the mirror claim me as currency. In the resolution of soul and body one becomes a resurrected being. Upon convalescence from a dangerous respiratory infection I found that the body is most malleable when it is healing. Furthermore, in releasing identification with either the soul or body as disintegrate and tyrannical isolated segments (inaccurate bifurcation causing distortion and externalization), it is remembered as an incorruptible, fluidly renewing field, contrary to the belief that matter is immutable solidity.
It was the sensation of this fluidity that inspired me to begin using the body as an artistic medium in itself. When I model, I feel the body shape-shifting to express the emotive attitude or state of consciousness. The body is an absolutely limitless, living work of art that embodies the disrobed self-recognition of divine perfection.
Billions of dollars are ushered into pharmaceutical research, and relatively minuscule attention is invested into enhancing the quality of life of those living with diseases. The message encoded in the manifestation of disease can never be heard this way. Disease is merely an unsung song. Full expression restores incorruptibility. Soul has virtually gone bankrupt in disenfranchised suppression, selling out to the belief systems that promulgate and peddle the artificial reality of perceived solidity and fatalism. At the benefit of a contrived segregation (yielding the illusion of control), soul and body are antagonistically opposed game pawns and Passion has lain dead. Pornography is the result of the core disempowerment of humankind caused by suppression of authentic sexuality. The images for this series were inspired to catalyze Ecstasy of a Cripple Part I: the Resurrection of Passion, the joining of seemingly diametrically opposed poles in fertile embrace. It is the healing of a core schism. We are the cure we have been waiting for.
Art of the God Hormone
""It is in this spaceless space unfettered by the rationale of thinking we know this or that to be an unmovable truth that effortless genius interprets and broadcasts Infinite Intent, revealing our bodies to be fluid, self-regenerative vehicles capable of producing the God Hormone, whose central purpose is the reception and transmission of divine inspiration,"" which Jocelyn says is the ""plenipotentiary, ever-new yet eternal self-unveiling."" It is this which takes the central theme of all Jocelyn's art and poetry. In Bollt’s interview, she says, ""Beauty is apocalypse. To loose all identity and feel the parts sucked through you like a cosmic-blowing liquid-honey-orgasm. Perplexion is the goop that bardic wonderment is made of. I want to be so enchanted by Art that I loose my mind. All linear constructs dissolve. It is the penultimate orgasm and yet it has no end. It is eternal unveiling. Apokolipsis ad infinitum.""

What’s Next and How You Can Help
Ecstasy of a Cripple Part II: WE ARE THE CURE promises to be yet more daring, venturing into unchartered territories of multi-layered erotic-apocalypse, through an extensive series of images trespassing beyond the confines of the matrix. Scheduled to shoot in July 2013, Thomas and Jocelyn will also begin working experimental Short Films which shall feature the dramatic performance of Jocelyn’s poetry, often composed in non-ordinary states of consciousness through a type of automatic writing.

<p>I'm a dancer and choreographer living and working in San Francisco, California and Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>Recently I've been awarded a prestigious scholarship for a 5-week residency this July-August called danceWEB, and it's at the biggest contemporary dance festival in the world: <a href=""http://www.impulstanz.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Impulstanz</a> - Vienna International Dance Festival. So you get an idea of how excited I am, out of over 1,000 applicants from 77 different countries, only about 60 slots were given. !  =)</p>
<p>The programme allows me to live with the other danceWEBbers for 5-weeks in Vienna, and I get to take all the workshops and classes, recieve individual mentorship from the super cool choreographer Ivo Dimchev, see all performances for free, and mostly network with other international artists. </p>
<p>This is the best platform in the world for me to grow both career-wise and artistically...to be influenced by leading people in the field and for me to influence others...and also get/do more work!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Raising the Money!</h3>
<p>danceWEB covers 2/3 of the programme costs, and I need to raise the other 1/3 plus travel expenses and per diem so I can eat well and get a beer once in a while. </p>
<p>This means I need to raise $4300 or almost 3300 euro. (In euros this breaks down to 2150 for 1/3 of the programme costs, 225 for travel from Berlin to Vienna, and approximately 25/day x 37 days). </p>
<p>As a small way to say thank you, I've posted a few perks on the right. (and I hear they have some nice postcards in Vienna... ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution helps me at a critical point in my development and career as an artist, and I'll be feeling your support directly throughout the festival residency. </p>
<p>I've dedicated my life to creating art/dance/performance because i believe that this is the best use of the gifts I've been given. I strive endlessly to fulfill their highest potentials for myself, the environment, those people around me, and to contribute to the future. Call it a calling or vocation or sense of duty, I believe that performing and making performance can change the world, and you would be supporting my humble efforts towards this. </p>
<p>You can find more information about my work on my website (which is still being worked on) at <a href=""http://jorgedehoyos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jorgedehoyos.com</a></p>
<p>You can also browse the Gallery Tab above to look at videos of some of my work!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Additional Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>$10 still goes a looong way if you can't really give so much more. I've donated during times of being broke, and it still felt like a good practice in detachment and generosity...but if a spritual pitch isn't enough, how about a big PLEASE?</p>
<p>But seriously, another way to support would be to pass this along and ask a friend or family member to consider donating. Most people are glad to help if they know it's going to a good cause...you could tell them that they're supporting the arts and/or a good friend who has an amazing opportunity presented to him. </p>
<p>Using the Indiegogo ""share tools"" is huge and it's also easy to send an email or re-post on facebook. This would be a huge help!</p>

The programme allows me to live with the other danceWEBbers for 5-weeks in Vienna, and I get to take all the workshops and classes, recieve individual mentorship from the super cool choreographer Ivo Dimchev, see all performances for free, and mostly network with other international artists. 
This is the best platform in the world for me to grow both career-wise and artistically...to be influenced by leading people in the field and for me to influence others...and also get/do more work!
 
Raising the Money!
danceWEB covers 2/3 of the programme costs, and I need to raise the other 1/3 plus travel expenses and per diem so I can eat well and get a beer once in a while. 
This means I need to raise $4300 or almost 3300 euro. (In euros this breaks down to 2150 for 1/3 of the programme costs, 225 for travel from Berlin to Vienna, and approximately 25/day x 37 days). 
As a small way to say thank you, I've posted a few perks on the right. (and I hear they have some nice postcards in Vienna... ;)
 
The Impact
Your contribution helps me at a critical point in my development and career as an artist, and I'll be feeling your support directly throughout the festival residency. 
I've dedicated my life to creating art/dance/performance because i believe that this is the best use of the gifts I've been given. I strive endlessly to fulfill their highest potentials for myself, the environment, those people around me, and to contribute to the future. Call it a calling or vocation or sense of duty, I believe that performing and making performance can change the world, and you would be supporting my humble efforts towards this. 
You can find more information about my work on my website (which is still being worked on) at http://jorgedehoyos.com
You can also browse the Gallery Tab above to look at videos of some of my work!
 
Additional Ways You Can Help
$10 still goes a looong way if you can't really give so much more. I've donated during times of being broke, and it still felt like a good practice in detachment and generosity...but if a spritual pitch isn't enough, how about a big PLEASE?
But seriously, another way to support would be to pass this along and ask a friend or family member to consider donating. Most people are glad to help if they know it's going to a good cause...you could tell them that they're supporting the arts and/or a good friend who has an amazing opportunity presented to him. 
Using the Indiegogo ""share tools"" is huge and it's also easy to send an email or re-post on facebook. This would be a huge help!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>So good...</h3>
<p></p>
<div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"">2011 has been so good for Fusebox we almost don't want it to end. The 2011 festival was the largest to date with over 25,000 people enjoying 36 events featuring hundreds of local, national and international artists. We added two full time staffers, and a fall season of programming that included a series of <i>Digestible Feats</i> events, <i>Haircuts by Children</i>, and a <i>Holiday Stroll</i>.</div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;""><br/></div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"">Here's the deal, we know that 2011 will come to an end, and we are ok with that because we are super excited about what Fusebox has planned for 2012.</div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;""><br/></div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"">
<b>BUT</b>, we do not want to let 2011 come to an end with out making one last appeal for your financial support. Tis the season for end-of-year-giving, and we know that you must be reading dozens of these appeals. So our request is that you remember Fusebox when making your end of year charitable gifts, and think of us when looking for some last minute gifts for the contemporary-hybrid-art-lover in your life.</div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;""><br/></div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>to the point...</h3>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"">Your donation (of any size) helps make sure we can savor the flavor of 2011 a little longer and end the year on a solid financial footing. We will parlay our succes from 2011 into 2012 ensuring that this time next year we are saying, ""Twenty-eleven who? Twenty-twelve is where its at!""</div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;""><br/></div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>what we need + what you get...</h3>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"">Gifts of any size are helpful. Just $12.65 pays a monthly phone bill - and a gift of $500 would help commission a new music performance for the 2012 festival. Gifts of all sizes are helpful and appreciated!   </div>
<div style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;""><br/></div>

</div></div>","So good...


2011 has been so good for Fusebox we almost don't want it to end. The 2011 festival was the largest to date with over 25,000 people enjoying 36 events featuring hundreds of local, national and international artists. We added two full time staffers, and a fall season of programming that included a series of Digestible Feats events, Haircuts by Children, and a Holiday Stroll.

Here's the deal, we know that 2011 will come to an end, and we are ok with that because we are super excited about what Fusebox has planned for 2012.


BUT, we do not want to let 2011 come to an end with out making one last appeal for your financial support. Tis the season for end-of-year-giving, and we know that you must be reading dozens of these appeals. So our request is that you remember Fusebox when making your end of year charitable gifts, and think of us when looking for some last minute gifts for the contemporary-hybrid-art-lover in your life.



to the point...
Your donation (of any size) helps make sure we can savor the flavor of 2011 a little longer and end the year on a solid financial footing. We will parlay our succes from 2011 into 2012 ensuring that this time next year we are saying, ""Twenty-eleven who? Twenty-twelve is where its at!""



what we need + what you get...
Gifts of any size are helpful. Just $12.65 pays a monthly phone bill - and a gift of $500 would help commission a new music performance for the 2012 festival. Gifts of all sizes are helpful and appreciated!   

We have some perks to help spark your imagination including t-shirts and highly discounted festival passes. Our only regret is that we cant ship these perks to you before the holidays. But we will get them to you in early January. Promise.

Many heart-felt thanks for your support this year (and next),

to simply describe my sister, to explain all the wonderful things she has done
in this world, and the people she has touched. She was truly an angel - she
lived to brighten people's days. </p>
<p>Healey
passed on June 7th, 2014. She set  goals before her bone marrow
transplant. She realized she was an artist at heart, and through her writing
and artwork she wanted to leave an imprint on the world. </p>
<p>She
would always talk about publishing once she got healthy. She never got a
chance, so I am making this account to give her that chance, to spread her art
as her legacy. </p>
<p>We
found a short story that Healey wrote a little over a year ago. It is a
beautiful tale of a girl finding her independence and inner light and becoming
a woman. When I read it after she passed, my heart swelled. One day I thought,
I want to read this story to my kids. I just knew I had to get this story
illustrated and published. </p>
<p>I
am creating this IndieGogo account to raise money to get this story illustrated
and published. And once we get this published, maybe we can work to compile her
other words and art, put them all on paper, and give it to the world. </p>
<p>If
you would like to get a little preview of Healey's words, you are welcome to read
her blog. </p>
<p><a href=""http://deepthoughtsbyhealey.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://deepthoughtsbyhealey.wordpress.com/</a></p><p></p> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We
are looking to create a 32-page children's book with 12 illustrations. </p>
<p>I
am new to the self-publishing world. The biggest initial cost will be to find
someone who can channel Healey's vision onto paper. It will be a difficult
task. Finding the right illustrator is important, and could cost
$2,000-$4,000. </p>
<p>We
will also need help in editing and layout, and I expect that to cost about
$500-$1000. </p>
<p>Any
leftover money will go towards future publications of Healey's artwork and
writing. </p>

Because Indiegogo takes a
higher percentage of the money if we do not meet our goal, I am setting my
expectations low. Please don't hesitate to donate more because the goal has
been met. This project can cost up to $7,000, and any future project may cost
as much.<p></p>

<b>FIVE HOURS OF AUDIO COMEDY!<br/><br/>I'm making an audio comedy science fiction series and would really love your support. <em> I'm looking for people who want to see <b>Flashback</b> happen and who want to hear the majority of the episodes NOW!</em><br/></b><br/><b>BACKSTORY</b><br/><br/>When I was persuaded to set up the patreon account nearly seven months ago it was because I was desperate to find the time to finish a project that has been ""on the go"" now for over four years. Actually, it all goes all the way back to something I did in 2000, when <strong>FLASHBACK</strong> started out as an experimental art video pilot. Originally conceived of by myself and video artist <strong>Michael Balser</strong>, the video pilot was directed by me and completely funded by both Michael and myself. Unfortunately at 
the time, viewers misinterpreted the collection of example scenes we'd filmed as an entire 
episode plot line, which of course, didn’t really make sense and, as it was 
so disjointed, professional interest in taking the project any further 
dwindled. However, years later many people constantly asked after the show, what had happened to it and was I ever thinking of trying to do something like it again? I guess it was because, even after the way things went, 
their imaginations for something like this had at least been fired up.<br/><br/>Over
 a decade later, I decided to bring the story and its characters back to life - but keep it as cheap as possible and so, the idea of an audio series was born. In the UK, where I now live, audio series on CD and download are really big business. People love them and there are a number of companies out there making audio content for the CD/download consumer or directly for the radio. So, I 
chose to embark on a journey to write ten new half hour episodes and, as a tribute to the spirit of what Michael and I started back then, I tried to include
 as much of Michael’s sense of humour in these new scripts as possible - we lost Michael in  2002, but he has never left my creative side. 
While many of the original actors from the pilot video returned to recreate 
their characters for audio, some were unable to do so because of other 
commitments, and a few characters were completely redeveloped to reflect
 what they were originally intended to be, should a longer series have 
resulted from the pilot. The large ensemble cast consists of Canadians<strong> JoAnne Garries, <a href=""http://suethomasdvd.com/th_gallery/tara-samuel/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tara Samuel</a>, Elfriede Erzen, Patrick Conner, Ryan Kelly, <a href=""http://www.vivmoore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Viv Moore</a>, Randall Lanthier,</strong> and <strong>David Tomlinson</strong>. They, along with a fabulous guest cast, have been joined by British talent: the writer/director/actor <strong><a href=""http://www.nigelfairs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nigel Fairs</a></strong> and the incomparable, multi-talented <strong><a href=""http://www.sarah-douglas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sarah Douglas</a></strong> <em>- who is best known in the science fiction world as the wonderfully nasty <strong>Ursa in the Superman films, Queen Taramis in Conan the Destroyer</strong> and so much more.<br/><br/>So,
 that was in 2011. I was like a one-man production company. I had written the material, invested in recording equipment, travelled back to Canada to record the actors in their own homes, travelled back to Britain to record cast here, and then bought audio software and started on the edits. All the work was being undertaken by me, on my dime, in whatever spare time I had, and in my initial enthusiasm, I had managed to finish about two and a half episodes when news came to me of the very sad death of one of my lead actors and friend, Patrick Conner. The project languished as a result, mainly because I couldn't bring myself to hear his voice - so upbeat in the out-takes, so fun to be around in recording and so genuinely giving as an actor and human being. So nothing happened on Flashback for some time. It was starting to look like a mountain that I'd never be able to climb, and the longer I left it, the taller and taller it seemed to be getting.<br/><br/>So to the beginning of 2014, and after talking with my friend Elfriede, who is also in the series, I began once again to edit. Elfriede told me that it would be a huge gift to the world and the people who knew Patrick to hear him perform one last time, in a little gem they didn't even know he had worked on. I had to agree with her, and now listening to his voice fills me with happy memories. But I suddenly found that time to work on edits had become almost non-existent because I was spending all of my work days on other people's projects in order to pay the bills. But since I had already invested a lot of money of my own into the project and needed to see it through to completion, another friend of mine suggested I sign up with Patreon.com and through gaining ""patrons"" of the arts, I'd get a sort of small salary every month - for every episode that I put out. It sounded like a great idea to force me to edit and mix the episodes, to then get a little income from them that could start to recoup my, and another friend's financial investment, and in effect, start selling the project to the public. So I signed up to Patreon, then promptly spent nearly £150 on advertising on my Facebook Flashback page and my personal page, and the Flashback blog and anywhere else I could, to get people interested in parting with $9 US for the ENTIRE ten episode series, (in nine monthly installments of course).<br/><br/><b>THE DISAPPOINTMENT</b><br/><br/>I thought for sure people would sign up to support the project. I even offered the first episode completely free and not part of the monthly contribution. The handful of people that did sign up are, and have been extremely good to me, but I think I was very depressed by the overall poor response. Lots of people I didn't even know, from places like Russia, Mexico, Japan, Germany, the US and Poland constantly liked the paid-for Facebook ads, the Facebook page itself and the free episode download or other ""free"" downloads such as previews of upcoming eps, interviews or other behind-the-scenes items. Every new episode got more and more Facebook likes (I had over six hundred likes off one advert alone) and attention, but sadly no one new signed up to Patreon. It is a little disheartening to think that possibly they felt that contributing $1 US per month (which worked out to less than £0.60) for nine months was either too much of an effort, or out of their price range. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, a lot of the lovely actors who were in the series sent me sweet messages saying that they would gladly contribute, but I turned them down. That was not what I was after. Besides, I was hoping that by finishing the series, I'd be able to eventually send money THEIR way - they all worked on <b>Flashback</b> for the price of lattes and donuts, after all! I think too that I was very disappointed on behalf of my actors - the Facebook campaign provided a lot of links to the actors' webpages and Facebook profiles, and I was shocked to see not one of the actors' friends or contacts had actually signed up to hear them in this new project.<br/><br/>So, I started to wonder what the overall problem might be. One person said that people in North America aren't really interested in audio projects and since many of the actors are from Canada, North Americans wouldn't buy into it and potential UK supporters or those from other countries wouldn't understand or empathise with the accents. Another friend told me it was all in how I advertised and that I really should promote the low, low cost of the series - given how a five-hour long audio here in the UK would likely retail for £25 - £40 for downloads alone. It was all becoming more and more complicated for me when all I wanted was for it to become much simpler! And I found myself adhering to the deal I made my patrons on the patreon site - I promised to put out one episode a month and, even despite not having a lot of free time, I've managed to do just that. I'm now up to seven episodes online, and I'm pretty proud of that accomplishment. The mountain seems a little smaller now, but there are three really big installments to come - the dramatic ending to the whole series still left to edit, score and mix over the coming Christmas season.<br/><br/><b>THE INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN</b><br/><br/>I have given thought to this Indiegogo campaign and felt that I should be honest with the emotional ups and downs I've experienced over the last few months with the Patreon campaign. I did start to wonder though - was the lack of response from people because the work isn't a tangible event like a play or screening, or a solid object, like a painting or a book, but something  internet-bound and practically virtual? Was that perhaps dissuading potential supporters?<br/><br/>This year alone I have responded to requests on-line through Facebook and email, to support no less than four artistic projects and one social campaign for funding.

Also, some people didn't really want the audio series because they don't listen to drama on audio, but still wanted to support me. In the end they just didn't bother because of the way the site operates. I get that. So, I'm taking yet another friend's advice and offering up the project on Indiegogo - to raise that last bit of capital to help me... well, first to recoup some of the ever-increasing amount of money that has already been put out by me, and next to afford the up-coming licensing fees for original music tracks, web hosting fees, etc. Plus, I really would like to get the series pressed as a box set of CDs and pitch the whole thing to radio stations in Canada, the UK and elsewhere and all that takes cash to do it. I know this is my project and I know that I am ultimately responsible for it, but it is also my art and it involves a dozen more artists in the creative process who are all waiting for it to come out, for it to be finished, celebrated and enjoyed.

</div></div>","FIVE HOURS OF AUDIO COMEDY!I'm making an audio comedy science fiction series and would really love your support.  I'm looking for people who want to see Flashback happen and who want to hear the majority of the episodes NOW!BACKSTORYWhen I was persuaded to set up the patreon account nearly seven months ago it was because I was desperate to find the time to finish a project that has been ""on the go"" now for over four years. Actually, it all goes all the way back to something I did in 2000, when FLASHBACK started out as an experimental art video pilot. Originally conceived of by myself and video artist Michael Balser, the video pilot was directed by me and completely funded by both Michael and myself. Unfortunately at 
the time, viewers misinterpreted the collection of example scenes we'd filmed as an entire 
episode plot line, which of course, didn’t really make sense and, as it was 
so disjointed, professional interest in taking the project any further 
dwindled. However, years later many people constantly asked after the show, what had happened to it and was I ever thinking of trying to do something like it again? I guess it was because, even after the way things went, 
their imaginations for something like this had at least been fired up.Over
 a decade later, I decided to bring the story and its characters back to life - but keep it as cheap as possible and so, the idea of an audio series was born. In the UK, where I now live, audio series on CD and download are really big business. People love them and there are a number of companies out there making audio content for the CD/download consumer or directly for the radio. So, I 
chose to embark on a journey to write ten new half hour episodes and, as a tribute to the spirit of what Michael and I started back then, I tried to include
 as much of Michael’s sense of humour in these new scripts as possible - we lost Michael in  2002, but he has never left my creative side. 
While many of the original actors from the pilot video returned to recreate 
their characters for audio, some were unable to do so because of other 
commitments, and a few characters were completely redeveloped to reflect
 what they were originally intended to be, should a longer series have 
resulted from the pilot. The large ensemble cast consists of Canadians JoAnne Garries, Tara Samuel, Elfriede Erzen, Patrick Conner, Ryan Kelly, Viv Moore, Randall Lanthier, and David Tomlinson. They, along with a fabulous guest cast, have been joined by British talent: the writer/director/actor Nigel Fairs and the incomparable, multi-talented Sarah Douglas - who is best known in the science fiction world as the wonderfully nasty Ursa in the Superman films, Queen Taramis in Conan the Destroyer and so much more.So,
 that was in 2011. I was like a one-man production company. I had written the material, invested in recording equipment, travelled back to Canada to record the actors in their own homes, travelled back to Britain to record cast here, and then bought audio software and started on the edits. All the work was being undertaken by me, on my dime, in whatever spare time I had, and in my initial enthusiasm, I had managed to finish about two and a half episodes when news came to me of the very sad death of one of my lead actors and friend, Patrick Conner. The project languished as a result, mainly because I couldn't bring myself to hear his voice - so upbeat in the out-takes, so fun to be around in recording and so genuinely giving as an actor and human being. So nothing happened on Flashback for some time. It was starting to look like a mountain that I'd never be able to climb, and the longer I left it, the taller and taller it seemed to be getting.So to the beginning of 2014, and after talking with my friend Elfriede, who is also in the series, I began once again to edit. Elfriede told me that it would be a huge gift to the world and the people who knew Patrick to hear him perform one last time, in a little gem they didn't even know he had worked on. I had to agree with her, and now listening to his voice fills me with happy memories. But I suddenly found that time to work on edits had become almost non-existent because I was spending all of my work days on other people's projects in order to pay the bills. But since I had already invested a lot of money of my own into the project and needed to see it through to completion, another friend of mine suggested I sign up with Patreon.com and through gaining ""patrons"" of the arts, I'd get a sort of small salary every month - for every episode that I put out. It sounded like a great idea to force me to edit and mix the episodes, to then get a little income from them that could start to recoup my, and another friend's financial investment, and in effect, start selling the project to the public. So I signed up to Patreon, then promptly spent nearly £150 on advertising on my Facebook Flashback page and my personal page, and the Flashback blog and anywhere else I could, to get people interested in parting with $9 US for the ENTIRE ten episode series, (in nine monthly installments of course).THE DISAPPOINTMENTI thought for sure people would sign up to support the project. I even offered the first episode completely free and not part of the monthly contribution. The handful of people that did sign up are, and have been extremely good to me, but I think I was very depressed by the overall poor response. Lots of people I didn't even know, from places like Russia, Mexico, Japan, Germany, the US and Poland constantly liked the paid-for Facebook ads, the Facebook page itself and the free episode download or other ""free"" downloads such as previews of upcoming eps, interviews or other behind-the-scenes items. Every new episode got more and more Facebook likes (I had over six hundred likes off one advert alone) and attention, but sadly no one new signed up to Patreon. It is a little disheartening to think that possibly they felt that contributing $1 US per month (which worked out to less than £0.60) for nine months was either too much of an effort, or out of their price range. Surprisingly, a lot of the lovely actors who were in the series sent me sweet messages saying that they would gladly contribute, but I turned them down. That was not what I was after. Besides, I was hoping that by finishing the series, I'd be able to eventually send money THEIR way - they all worked on Flashback for the price of lattes and donuts, after all! I think too that I was very disappointed on behalf of my actors - the Facebook campaign provided a lot of links to the actors' webpages and Facebook profiles, and I was shocked to see not one of the actors' friends or contacts had actually signed up to hear them in this new project.So, I started to wonder what the overall problem might be.

<h3>WE""RE DOING IT AGAIN!!</h3>
<p>We had our first Draw-mania! last month and it was a fantastic success, so much so that we just have to offer another, and maybe keep it going on a monthly basis, at least through the summer. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Is It?</h3>
<p>The New York art scene has been aching for a new Draw-a-thon for quite a while now. You know, get a bunch of the best figurative (nude) models, a room full of artists armed with their favorite drawing materials, and this time, add a little spice to the mix: A great DJ, some amazing drink specials, and for a twist, intersperse the figure models with Downtown's newest and most cutting-edge comedians. It'll be a fantastic evening for artists and their friends! If you're an artist who's been trying to introduce friends to what you do, or you're looking for a unique first-date experience with someone daring and creative, this is the event for you! (OK-- some of your friends aren't as cool as you about the nude models...There's a separate bar area. Problem solved!)</p>
<p>For the latest info on the event, check out our website: <a href=""http://www.draw-mania.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.draw-mania.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.draw-mania.com</a></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Besides being a great, offbeat party experience, this event is also a serious resource for figurative artists and at the same time a terrific way for people with little or no experience to jump into the pool in a fun, non-judgmental environment. Figurative art is very much a living tradition, but it's also one that doesn't always get the attenuation it deserves. It may be the single most relaxing and meditative of all art-activities, but it's also one of the most exciting and one that really develops a person's drawing skills and visual perception faster and stronger than anything else.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This maybe the most modest campaign on indiegogo! We're doing everything to keep the cost down, and in fact, for the price of a single session at a regular class with a single model, we offer an assortment of top models, music and other great entertainment in an uber-cool East Village location. Nearly all of the revenue from ticket sales goes to the expenses of running the event and paying the models. We've structured the event to be self-supporting, but a little seed money to cover setup and opeerating costs will help us get a running start. We're asking the lowest amount indiegogo allows! <br/><br/>In exchange for your support, you get tickets at a discounted price (or honorable mention on our website if you're not able to attend), and at the higher level, a terrific t-shirt as well!!</p>
<p>  </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>DRAW! If you do already, encourage others. If you, try it-- you'll love it. And don't be afraid to push your boundaries--that's where figure drawing comes in. Dare, to enjoy it and have fun with it. Scientists believe it can increase the efficiency of your brain and keep your mind sharp and young at any age. And come to a Draw-mania event!</p>

<strong> </strong>Why do I want to go to the <a href=""http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/#http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harbourfront Centre</a>?</h3>
<p>A residency will offer me much needed time to experiment and research my <a href=""http://www.nadinesaylor.com/Installations.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“water works” series</a>. Through the development of this work, I will create large installations and consequently a public art portfolio. Currently, I am working on an installation <a href=""http://www.nadinesaylor.com/Castings.html#1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called “Portals of the Past”</a> through which I replicate the void of keyholes by using cast glass.<strong><br/></strong>Images of “women in waiting” are sandblasted on their surface. The mixture of the keyhole form and female body transforms the object into a form of “peep-hole,” in which the viewer is positioned as a secret voyeur of an unaware object of study. I am also interested in the rise and fall of industry in our world. The portals, (keyholes, windows, and doors) are reference to architecture. I am interested in sharing the beauty that is imbued in old architecture, as they are also ladies “in- waiting” of their inherrent future.</p>
<p> I am looking towards this residency as THE ideal opportunity to launch my artistic career in a new direction, work on those ideas that have been at the tip of my fingers and to build a business that will sustain myself for the future. I am excited by the possibility for exchange of ideas with the numerous artists in the community in the Craft Department at <strong><a href=""http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/#http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harbourfront Centre</a></strong>, Sheridan College and the Greater Toronto Area arts community.</p>
<p> Furthermore, this opportunity will provide me with an international network and the opportunity to work alongside of other artists making a living and sustaining their futures as artists. I intend to exhibit the work produced during this period in national and international galleries and museums and am presenting lectures and workshops to the members of the art community in 2013, as well as to the wider public, upon the completion of my residency.<strong>     </strong></p>

The mixture of the keyhole form and female body transforms the object into a form of “peep-hole,” in which the viewer is positioned as a secret voyeur of an unaware object of study. I am also interested in the rise and fall of industry in our world. The portals, (keyholes, windows, and doors) are reference to architecture. I am interested in sharing the beauty that is imbued in old architecture, as they are also ladies “in- waiting” of their inherrent future.
 I am looking towards this residency as THE ideal opportunity to launch my artistic career in a new direction, work on those ideas that have been at the tip of my fingers and to build a business that will sustain myself for the future. I am excited by the possibility for exchange of ideas with the numerous artists in the community in the Craft Department at Harbourfront Centre, Sheridan College and the Greater Toronto Area arts community.
 Furthermore, this opportunity will provide me with an international network and the opportunity to work alongside of other artists making a living and sustaining their futures as artists. I intend to exhibit the work produced during this period in national and international galleries and museums and am presenting lectures and workshops to the members of the art community in 2013, as well as to the wider public, upon the completion of my residency.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>I had a vision one night on the Playa last year after an encounter with several random groups. I had a 8 person art car and alot of people I taxied around said they could not get on the other big art cars. Well this kinda stinks because I had the same thing happen my first year on the Playa too. This vision involves a bus, tons of lumber, metal, welding, paint, and a all to make a LARGE CARGO area called a flight deck. NOT JUST DANCING and MUSIC EITHER I want to see </span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">maybe a fire conclave ride aboard one night doing shows then maybe one night be a slumber party with chill music, PJs and pillows all over the deck. Open your mind and give me input as to what is imaginable what is possible here. Hell I could even host the first plane landing on a carrier in the BRC ever. Well RC flying of course. Skydiver target area (maybe if someone arranged for it). The ideas are endless and with the communities help, and funding, it can be what YOU want it to be used for...like a bacon cook off at the trash fence on Friday at Sunset. But I SOOO want to just build it. What it is used for is up to the ones on the deck at the time.<br/>Please help with the ideas, the donations, and the funds and we will see you in on the Playa 2013-)'(-</span></p>

<p>I’m James. I make interactive art &amp; contraptions rooted in the juxtaposition between nature, man &amp; machine. So it’s no surprise that my latest interactive sculpture ""Sessilanoid: A Sum of All Parts"" is a cocktail of barnacles, stormtroopers and the aurora borealis. At 10 feet high x 40 feet long and featuring elaborate programmed color patterns, Sessilanoid premiered in Los Angeles at Gallery 825/LAAA.org. The positive attention it received made it eligible to participate in Art Basel 2013! Click on the image below to see the video:</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS ART BASEL?</strong></p>
<p>To paraphrase wikipedia, Art Basel “marks the summer reunion of the international art world, hosted by the city of Basel, which has been a cultural capital for centuries. The artworks exhibited attract more than 60,000 artists, collectors, gallerists, museum directors, curators, and art enthusiasts.” I still have to pinch myself to believe that years of pursuing my artistic inclinations has brought this epic opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>GETTING THERE</strong></p>
<p>With this amazing opportunity comes great costs that I have yet to manifest. $6500.00 covers airfare, lodging and shipment of Sessilanoid, as well as components needed to control the lighting. If by chance I exceed my goal, the funds will be put into getting the sculpture back home, (yup, just focusing on getting it there right now) and getting it ready for Art Basel Miami, which it was also selected for!</p>
<p><strong>OFFERINGS &amp; CONTRIBUTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Additionally (and/or alternatively) to financial contributions, there are many ways to help. A few are:</p>
<p>• Blogs &amp; Social Networks: If this sculpture inspires you in any way, please spread the word! <br/> • Friend me on facebook.com/artcontraptions or Follow me on twitter.com/artcontraptions and spark a conversation. I am excited to hear your thoughts and feedback regarding Sessilanoid.<br/> • Know of any other social media networks I should get hip to?

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Since starting Omit Limitation it has always been our goal to get a space. Creative talks in our local coffee shops could only suffice for so long. The brand is growing and we want to continue to challenge ourselves. Our team of creatives constantly seek ways to improve the brand on the soul reason that we wouldn't be Omit Limitation if we remained stagnant and we are aware of the growing pains.</p>
<h4>Time Management &amp; Financial Costs</h4>
<p>The Gallery is slated to open for Mid April 2016. We have a lot of work to get done to get it up to shape.We have planned a rigorous schedule to effectively and efficiently check off tasks and are being mindful of the financial pressure that renovations can weigh. Your support will help us take the financial burden off our shoulders and allow us to create a space at a higher level for the community. </p>
<p>Admitting these obstacles are a reality our team understands that anything worth having is worth the risks, It's just a part of the game when it comes to creating art. Building the gallery and creative space is a maturing process for all of us and we are excited to have a space that can enable other creatives to create within.</p>

Obtaining our own space is the next step forward for our initiative to continue to cultivate, raise community and evoke a creative consciousness in our atmosphere. You can find out more about our various events on our Omit Limitation website here.



Risks & Challenges Since starting Omit Limitation it has always been our goal to get a space. Creative talks in our local coffee shops could only suffice for so long. The brand is growing and we want to continue to challenge ourselves. Our team of creatives constantly seek ways to improve the brand on the soul reason that we wouldn't be Omit Limitation if we remained stagnant and we are aware of the growing pains.
Time Management & Financial Costs
The Gallery is slated to open for Mid April 2016. We have a lot of work to get done to get it up to shape.We have planned a rigorous schedule to effectively and efficiently check off tasks and are being mindful of the financial pressure that renovations can weigh. Your support will help us take the financial burden off our shoulders and allow us to create a space at a higher level for the community. 
Admitting these obstacles are a reality our team understands that anything worth having is worth the risks, It's just a part of the game when it comes to creating art. Building the gallery and creative space is a maturing process for all of us and we are excited to have a space that can enable other creatives to create within.



Other Ways You Can Help We're looking to raise 3,000 (CAD) If you don't have the money to spare doesn't mean you can't help us make an impact. Help us spread the word by sharing this campaign using social media, indiegogo sharing tools, word of mouth anything helps to make the dream work.

<h3>Help MudFire's Volunteers get to NCECA 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>MudFire is an open access ceramic studio in Decatur GA. Our instructor base is comprised of volunteers working in exchange for 24/7 access to our studio. Most of our volunteers are post BFA or students needing access to wheels, kilns, clay and glazes. Daphne and I provide mentor-ship and guidance but we wanted to do more for this particularly motivated and special group of volunteers. We are personally donating artwork, time, and studio perks to this campaign to help these volunteers get to NCECA 2017 in Portland.</li>
<li>As artists ourselves, we know how cost prohibitive setting up a studio or traveling to a conference can be for less established artists. Crucial networking, residency and job opportunities, and show connections can be made during NCECA. Also, Portland's galleries and museums will participate, giving our volunteers the opportunity to see artists working in ceramics from around the world. Additionally, speakers, presenters, and demonstrators will be discussing their techniques for surface decoration, 3D printing for clay, ceramic printing technologies, and more! The chance to see and interact with those on the forefront of the makers movement and technology in ceramics will be invaluable to MudFire both in the experience of our volunteers and how new techniques will come back and be incorporated in our home studio.</li>
<li>Giving to this campaign will give these artists a chance to experience all that NCECA has to offer and in exchange they will give you an item handcrafted by them, here in our studio.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Help Fund and Get a Handcrafted Ceramic Item</h3>
<ul>
<li>Conference attendance costs an average of $300 per person, flights will be close to $400 per person, plus housing expenses of $300 per person. With a group this size covering these expenses will not be possible without help from others.</li>
<li>In exchange for your generous gift, MudFire's artists have created handmade objects ranging from pins, ornaments, and magnets to cups, mugs, robots, and vases. There is something here for everyone at every price range. MudFire will also be donating studio perks and Deanna and Daphne are personally making artworks as well.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal on Indiegogo - our volunteers are also participating in holiday shows and sales to self-fund the rest of their trip to NCECA. Any raised funds will be distributed and used toward our NCECA goal.</li>

<p><b>Who
we are:</b></p>
<p><b>Studio 8</b></p>
<p>Studio 8 is an independent art and dance
collective and we run our own community-based performing arts space in Amman,
Jordan. It was founded by two brothers, Anas and Abdul Hadi Nahleh for their
love of dance. There was nowhere for them to practice when they began because
dance in Jordan is often limited to those who can pay for it, so they learned
to dance in the street. The Nahleh brothers are now accomplished and renowned
breakdancers, have been running their own studio for two years, and want to
give the local community the space to create and practice that they didn’t have
as young dancers. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442590558/khrzndfszm4jjuknq3mk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>It is our belief, and we have seen this
proven over the years, that the performing arts give people an outlet for self-expression,
self-discovery, and healing. They also encourage creative and critical
thinking. Many of our students are youth who cannot otherwise afford arts and
dance training, have no access to the arts at school or at home. We have
students from all different walks of life, including refugees to Jordan from
surrounding countries. What our students
have in common is their talent and dedication. <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442590593/mpcsrdxzdqu496m8opje.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our mission is to maintain our studio as
a safe space for new ideas and art forms out of reach from commercial,
corporate and cultural constraints. 

<p></p>
<p><b>For the last two years we have:</b></p>
<p><b>Performed </b>at street art events such as Big Fat Street Jam, Fire
Jam, Baladk, and the launch of FADA317 graffiti space.</p>
<p><b>Provided </b>unique and interesting dance classes such as West
African Dance with drumming, Indian Dance, Dabkeh, Break Dance, Popping, Hip
Hop, Belly Dance and Salsa.</p>
<p><b>Facilitated </b>our very own Laughter Yoga sessions andpublic
dance workshops in interesting locations such as Sakeyat Addarawesh cultural café,
7Hills Skatepark, Darat Al Funun and the streets of Amman. </p>
<p><b>Initiated</b> the very first comprehensive circus practice in
Amman, working with fire spinning, stilts, wheel spinning, and more. </p>
<p><b>Created</b> “The Making Of” series of workshops which were hosted
in Darat Al Funun and included creative writing, dance and poetry, dance drawing,
dance and live music, dance and space, and digital storytelling. These were
available free of charge to the general public. </p>
<p><b>Arranged </b>the only Beatbox workshops available in Amman, whose
participants go on to compete for the national King of the Beat and Beatbox
Unlimited competitions. These competitions are often the first time these young
artists have the opportunity to be on stage. </p>
<p><b>Produced</b> an environmental and contemporary art exhibition
in Amman city centre. </p>

should back this campaign?</b></p>
<p>We
have worked hard these past two years to build a strong artistic and dancing
community. Now we need your help. We can build an even better Studio 8
community if we have a place to ourselves because we will not be limited by
noise complaints. At the moment, we are being evicted by our current landlord.
This is our second eviction in two years. This is happening in spite of our
honesty and up front approach when we sign our rent contracts with landlords
and in spite of our efforts to select locations which are soundproofed and
commercial areas. The only reason is the intolerance of art, music and dance.
Your support will give us more flexibility when looking for an adequate and
nice space. And most
importantly, it will greatly contribute to the creative and artistic
effervescence of Amman!<span>  </span></p>
<p>We
have big ideas for our space. We are not worried about students and attendance
or activities. We are OVERFLOWING with ideas. We plan to hold big community
dance classes for everyone! We want to host cultural events! We want to host
events with film and food! We want a communion of ideas and dreams. We want artists
to feel comfortable using the space as a collaborative hub and simply make
amazing ART. It is our dream to host an artist residency to bring artists from
all over the world and to give free community classes in Amman. With your help
all of this is possible. You help us get our space together, and we’ll take
care of the rest and bring you ART, DANCE and FUN! </p>
<p><b>Where your
is money going</b></p>
<p>Although our classes and programmes are popular, the
challenge we are currently facing is our landlord and neighborhood’s hostility
to dance. We do not have the funds to get a new space right now, and we have
been barred from hosting arts events in our current space. Your donations will
give us that margin to find the right space for our community. </p>

Who
we are:
Studio 8
Studio 8 is an independent art and dance
collective and we run our own community-based performing arts space in Amman,
Jordan. It was founded by two brothers, Anas and Abdul Hadi Nahleh for their
love of dance. There was nowhere for them to practice when they began because
dance in Jordan is often limited to those who can pay for it, so they learned
to dance in the street. The Nahleh brothers are now accomplished and renowned
breakdancers, have been running their own studio for two years, and want to
give the local community the space to create and practice that they didn’t have
as young dancers. It is our belief, and we have seen this
proven over the years, that the performing arts give people an outlet for self-expression,
self-discovery, and healing. They also encourage creative and critical
thinking. Many of our students are youth who cannot otherwise afford arts and
dance training, have no access to the arts at school or at home. We have
students from all different walks of life, including refugees to Jordan from
surrounding countries. What our students
have in common is their talent and dedication. Our mission is to maintain our studio as
a safe space for new ideas and art forms out of reach from commercial,
corporate and cultural constraints. 


For the last two years we have:
Performed at street art events such as Big Fat Street Jam, Fire
Jam, Baladk, and the launch of FADA317 graffiti space.
Provided unique and interesting dance classes such as West
African Dance with drumming, Indian Dance, Dabkeh, Break Dance, Popping, Hip
Hop, Belly Dance and Salsa.
Facilitated our very own Laughter Yoga sessions andpublic
dance workshops in interesting locations such as Sakeyat Addarawesh cultural café,
7Hills Skatepark, Darat Al Funun and the streets of Amman. 
Initiated the very first comprehensive circus practice in
Amman, working with fire spinning, stilts, wheel spinning, and more. 
Created “The Making Of” series of workshops which were hosted
in Darat Al Funun and included creative writing, dance and poetry, dance drawing,
dance and live music, dance and space, and digital storytelling. These were
available free of charge to the general public. 
Arranged the only Beatbox workshops available in Amman, whose
participants go on to compete for the national King of the Beat and Beatbox
Unlimited competitions. These competitions are often the first time these young
artists have the opportunity to be on stage. 
Produced an environmental and contemporary art exhibition
in Amman city centre.

<h3>About Manfred and Julia</h3>
<p>Julia and Manfred are senior Arts Management majors. Both extremely passionate about self-confidence, diversity, and loving yourself, creating a magazine to promote self-love was the obvious choice for these artists.</p>
<p>While Julia uses fashion to express that one can be in love with themselves inside and out, Manfred is taking his love for diversity, social justice, and his passion for all aspects of art, to bring a unique twist to the traditional lifestyle magazine. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Ge<strong>t</strong>
</h3>
<p>Daily Moda will cost $1,000 to get up and running. </p>
<p>We've already purchased our domain in order to run Daily Moda online.</p>
<p>Writing is a lot of work, and takes a special skill set, interest, and can be time-consuming. We'd love to compensate our writers in any way that we can, meaning we'd be using a small portion of all donations received to help out our hardworking writers.</p>
<p>About $400 will be allotted towards online ads, such as Facebook and Instagram ads, as well as ads on other websites and popular blogs with high traffic. This will help drive traffic to our site, and help get our message of diversity and self-love out there.    </p>
<p>If we are not able to reach our goal, the money will still be put to good use, printing a spring catalog being our first priority, and compensating writers being the next. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Confidence is something so many of us struggle with, or have struggled with, and Daily Moda wants people to feel that they are indeed beautiful in their own skin. Daily Moda wants its readers to know that there is beauty in being different, in being an artist, and in being exactly who you are.</p>
<p>Daily Moda also provides a creative outlet for people to be heard and appreciated, especially for those whose voices have not been heard as loudly as others. In a world filled with injustice, Daily Moda serves as a safe space and sanctuary for YOU. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Marketing a new fashion and lifestyle magazine is a great challenge. There is a lot of effort and time that goes into social media marketing, which will be our main form of communication for this online publication. Being a two-man band, our biggest challenge will be splitting up creating the magazine, running a business, and being marketers all at the same time. However, we are extremely confident that with your help, Daily Moda will succeed, and YOUR voices will be heard far and wide. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Manfred and Julia greatly appreciate all of your time and would be eternally thankful if you could share this page, follow us, and spread the word about Daily Moda and the campaign. The message we wish to send is not exclusive to us two; it's the same message of love and acceptance that we all want to spread. Please don't stress if you are unable to donate; there are other ways to contribute which are absolutely FREE! Simply staying engaged in our content by subscribing to dailymodamagazine.com, and following us on our social media, shows your support and gives your featured peers an audience. You can also contribute by letting your friends and family know what Daily Moda is all about!</p>
<p>And remember, we've only got 60 days in total to reach our goal, so let's make this happen!</p>

<br/><br/><h4>Our Project</h4>
<p><i><em></em>Moving Targets</i> parallels the 2014 centenary of the
extinction of the passenger pigeon with the coerced migrations of our mothers’
families. One hundred years ago, in the wake of the pogroms, Ann’s mother and
Steffi’s grandfather fled the Ukraine to begin new lives in North America.
Within a decade of their arrival, the uniquely American passenger pigeon was
hunted to extinction. </p>
<p>The highways, trains, ships and telegraphs
that made it possible for millions of Jews to flee across land and sea made it
equally possible for a hungry American population to track and plunder
passenger pigeon nesting sites. To make sense of the contradictions of these concurrent
narratives, we look at where these two worlds overlap, and ask why some
communities, whether human or animal, have been targeted for extinction.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Heya!
I'm Joe. or JWMHP.
I'm an ex-Barista, now Woodworker, Mixtaper, and aspiring Poet. And sometimes I'm a gentleman. 
What I'd like to do is take a break from the Feast and Famine of (sub)Contracting and sit here at my desk and write down all the Highly Incredible things that i think about when the saws are blazing.
Since 1999 or so, (and moreso throughout hospital stays during 2000), I've been picking away at poems and letters trying to find my voice. I think that in the last couple years, I've found it. I have some things I need to get off my chest (they're not 'Moobs', they're ""Mreasts"" and they're badges of wisdom).
It's been a long journey, 60lbs (and counting), a metric tonne of Ballentine's empties, some mean things uttered loudly in the night, and lots of little gifts spread around Vancouver.
...I think what I have to say, if I can say it correctly, has some value. I've no illusion that it's anything new, mind you... just... uniquely me.
So Here it Goes:
I'm Adopted. Among a handful of other really mind-bending Experiences and Transgressions, (both positive and negative), having a pair of unbelievably solid Parents for 36 years doesn't necessarily guarantee that One True feeling of Wholeness.
I joked to a couple friends last Weekend, that I wanted to Make just enough Viable Art to become visible enough that My Birth Mother might Find Me... My Real Mom prepared all the papers Years ago on my behalf, and Being the complacent, patient procrastinator I Am, I never did fill out those papers let alone send them off. Frankly Some Ghost from 36 Years ago hasn't until now, been worth the $100 it costs to register your name in an active search Database...
Anyway. Enough about that for now.
I have a touch of the OCD and compulsively make what the Kids call 'Mixtapes' to process through my thoughts and feelings whenever I feel it necessary. I've been making one every day since July 1st, having been given the gift of pure Joy by a few folks from a Vancouver Arts Magazine called SadMag... More than a little appropriate if you read on...
Now It's August 4th, and I have just completed the Outline to the Creative Non-Fiction novel you, if you choose to do so, will be helping to finance for my goal of a December completion so (you guessed it) When I engineer a way to get both my Mom and my Dad in this year's ""secret"" Santa draw... I won't have to waste the $75 dollar value ceiling, and instead I can invest in some paraphernalia to maybe try and quit smoking for Real. Again...
Your help with some cashish would maybe tie up the remainder of my personal therapy, cover some bills, and allow me to make-good on several IOUs i have with friends.

<p>INTERNATIONAL DANCE 4 POSITIVITY-LIVING BREATHING COLOR WHEEL-(HUMAN COLOR WHEEL)</p>
<p>My name is Patricia AIshah.  I want to THANK YOU for taking a few minutes to check out my art project. </p>
<p>I am asking you today to support my project financially and share your support with like minded friends who see the value in creating an INTERNATIONAL pARTICIPATORY work of art with a message of POSITIVITY for all to share.  Whether you have $5.00 or 500.00 to donate, please consider joining my efforts.</p>
<p>The concept is very simple.  To create a giant Living Breathing Color Wheel Dance 4 Positivity by giving away 111 beautiful Silk Veils to <em>perfectly great strangers</em> from all over the world at 11:11 AM in the Black Rock Desert of NV. </p>
<p>With an attendance of over 50,000 people from all 7 continents, I am certain to have an overabundance of eager pARTicipants to BE THE ART !!!  These veils will be gifted to all the pARTicipants with the idea that they will take them out to the world and SHARE the experience, spreading the POSITIVITY around the world.</p>
<p>MISSION STATEMENT:    </p>
<ul>
<li>Through dancing with intention, put the term POSITIVITY into the forefront of our consciousness</li>
<li>To create a HUMAN COLOR WHEEL, a Living Breathing Work of art where both the art and the artists are made from everyday people, people who may have never thought of themselves as an artist or performer</li>
<li>Create a more positive outlook within the hearts and souls of individuals</li>
<li>Encourage these individuals to travel &amp; share this positivity with the intention of expanding the experience above and beyond our local communities into an ever growing spiral that will eventually encompass all of Earth and bathe our limitless Universe in a more positive light.</li>
</ul>
I am budgeting $23.00 each for 111 veils.  This will cover my cost and for the veils, the incientives AND incomes taxes I will need to pay as this is not yet set up as a non profit.
<p>If you donate a minimum of $25.00 or more we will send you a hand signed limited edition postcard COMPLETE with playa dust from the playa at Burning Man.  (I am especially thinking of all of you who cannot make it the the Burn this year.)</p>
<p>For your $50.00 Donation you will receive an authentic International Dance 4 Positivity – Living Breathing Color Wheel Veil, and the limited editon postcard</p>
<p>For $250.00 or more you will receive your very own set of 6 International Dance 4 Positivity – Living Breathing Color Wheel Veils, and the limited edition postcard so you can start your very own color wheel right at home </p>
<p>So please donate what you can… &amp; PLEASE SHARE this project with all your friends and family.  With your help and generous donations we will certainly share the  POSITIVITY not only at Burning Man but world wide.</p>
<p>And if by chance we do not make our goal we still have the event.  We will use the money to purchase as many veils as we can and send our as far an wide as possible.</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME, ENERGY and GENOUS DONATIONS!  You are helping to make a lot of dreams come true!</p>

<p>Quick Note:100% of your funds backing, will go towards product 
purchase on my online clothing store launch as an option for you(please 
save your receipts)! </p>
<p>I believe in empowering women with 
reawakening their divine goddess through the artistic talent i express 
through my loving clothing designs. I believe in sharing my artistic 
expression of love, so I can hug women through my clothing. When you 
wear my goddess wear, im really hugging you. If your a man, thank me for
 beautifying your view all around the world. :-)</p>
<p>My story began as
 an artist. I joined a community of spiritual festivals where creativity
 was booming, like burning man, lightning in a bottle and coachella. 
From there i took my artistic creativity and started designing through 
the medium of clothing. As I awakened my higher self, i had a desire of 
awakening the divine femenin goddes through dressing women, with my 
loving divine creative wear. To the divine feminine of the world, i want
 to say, i love you, your reawakening of the divine goddess is important
 to me, your joy your beauty your fun in wearing my divine diva goddess 
clothing, is what I live for and its my mission in this lifetime, so 
enjoy, and thank you for your support, woman or man! Thank you!</p>
<p>More
 about me: North Hollywood, is where i live. I was born in the Dominican
 Republic, im latina, i speak spanish and english. Mother is dominican,

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Quick Note:100% of your funds backing, will go towards product 
purchase on my online clothing store launch as an option for you(please 
save your receipts)! 
I believe in empowering women with 
reawakening their divine goddess through the artistic talent i express 
through my loving clothing designs. I believe in sharing my artistic 
expression of love, so I can hug women through my clothing. When you 
wear my goddess wear, im really hugging you. If your a man, thank me for
 beautifying your view all around the world. :-)
My story began as
 an artist. I joined a community of spiritual festivals where creativity
 was booming, like burning man, lightning in a bottle and coachella. 
From there i took my artistic creativity and started designing through 
the medium of clothing. As I awakened my higher self, i had a desire of 
awakening the divine femenin goddes through dressing women, with my 
loving divine creative wear. To the divine feminine of the world, i want
 to say, i love you, your reawakening of the divine goddess is important
 to me, your joy your beauty your fun in wearing my divine diva goddess 
clothing, is what I live for and its my mission in this lifetime, so 
enjoy, and thank you for your support, woman or man! Thank you!

<p>Thanks so much for checking out my project. The concept is very simple and comes from my love to create nice motion graphics. The idea is to create different logo animations for different people. It is applicable for both people and companies, as simple as that. Each contributor will receive a unique, custom made and professionally animated motion graphic of their logo. It could be a personal logo or a logo of their business, presentation, band, brand, blog, etc. Pretty much anything (nothing obscene or inappropriate though).<br/>Then, all the animations will be brought together in one big showreel. The scale of the project could be pretty huge, depending on the number of contributors.</p>

<p>Upon successful funding transfer, I'll reach out to each contributor in order to get detailed information about their logo and company or idea behind the logo. Please note the perk levels carefully. Let’s face it, $125 is really, really cheap for motion graphics. The animation will be 5- 10 seconds long and revisions based on contributor’s feedback won’t be included in those lower levels of funding. There are higher levels with more options. However, I am absolutely committed to design unique and quality animations that serve the needs of the contributors. I will not produce anything that I wouldn't be proud of as an artist. If you have any questions about the animation process, just let me know.<br/>I want to let everyone know that the time spent on each individual animation may be limited and it varies between 1- 4 days, depending on the perk level.<br/>In order to make everything clear I will contact every contributor and establish a deadline for their animation. However, creating high quality animations in a limited amount of time probably won't be easy, but I'm excited to push my inspiration and creativity to new limits.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With your help, the <strong>Independent Media Arts Alliance</strong> (IMAA) will launch an<strong> inaugural National Media Arts Prize </strong>in June 2014 that will recognize Canadian independent media artists.</p>
<p>We are looking to establish a prize similar to those existing in other arts sectors.  Arts prizes national in scope exist for litterature, visual arts, music, theatre, but there are no prizes that honour the independent media arts exclusively. These cash awards are valued anywhere from 10K – 50K.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Independent Media Art? </strong></h3>
<p>The term media arts applies to all forms of time-related or interactive art works that are created by the recording of sounds, visual images, or use new technologies. These art works are creative expressions and encompass the fields of film, audio, video and computer, digital, electronic art. </p>
<p>It’s exhibited everywhere from art galleries to movie theatres, on the web, in public space and even on cell phones. As technology progresses artists are eager to use new tools to reflect the world around them. Even Salvador Dali who is best known as a surrealist painter experimented in film in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In the 1960’s, video technology was introduced and since then media art has grown to include digital and electronic media. Independent means that the artist initiates and is the driving force behind the work and maintains complete creative control over the work. Media art is all around us.</p>
<p>Independent media artists deliver thought-provoking works, and are continuously challenging our underlying perceptions. Media Artists dedicate their lives to the field; by choosing to maintain <strong>complete creative control</strong> over their work they make sacrifices, pool resources from a number of sources including their own financial contributions to realize their productions.</p>
<p>As it stands, this critical aspect of the creative process is so crucial as we live in an increasingly commercialized world dominated by mainstream media. Independent media artists contribute to the democratic process by giving voice to individuals within a diverse society. By supporting independent media artists and recognizing their valuable contribution to our everyday lives, we further diversity of vision in artistic expression, technology and social consciousness.</p>
<p>It is important that the winner is selected by a jury of peers, given the nature of independent media art, we feel that a committee of fellow media artists and professionals in the field will be the best people to assess the quality of achievement in terms of creativity, innovation and impact within the sector. </p>
<p>The IMAA is a member-driven non-profit organization with charitable status working to advance and strengthen the media arts sector in Canada. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our objective is to raise a minimum of<strong> 20 000$</strong> to launch this inaugural prize.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to award a mid-career artist with a significant cash prize to acknowledge their contributions to the sector and to the cultural community.  Funds raised through this initiative will also be used to promote the artist and the prize by creating a video, purchasing ad space, publishing press releases, and covering travel expenses for the winning artist to attend the National Media Arts Conference taking place in June 2014 where they will be presented with the prize at an award ceremony.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we can offer some perks to <strong>KiloByte</strong><strong> Sponsors, <strong>MegaByte</strong> Sponsors, <strong>GigaByte</strong> Sponsors, TeraByte Sponsors, <strong>PetaByte</strong> Sponsors,</strong> <strong>ExaByte <strong>Sponsors</strong></strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>ZettaByte Sponsors</strong>.</p>
<p>If you, or your company wishes to fund the full prize and in an ongoing way, then we could even name the prize after you! In that case, it is best to contact the IMAA directly to develop the prize and the benefits together: (514) 522-8240 <a href=""http://www.imaa.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.imaa.ca</a></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>By establishing a prize like this, we put the spotlight on media artists and their contribution to Canadian society and culture. This prize will encourage many young artists to enter into this dynamic field and empower individuals and communities. We hope to introduce this art form to a larger audience and engage people in this exciting field. Ultimately, we hope to increase visibility of media artists in Canada and abroad, put Canada on the international map for the amazing media art that is being produced here.  Our goal is to strengthen the media arts in Canada and everywhere in the world!</p>
<p>With your help, we want to continue supporting the talented and integral media artists of our nation, but we need the support of the larger community to get this project off the ground!</p>

Short Summary
With your help, the Independent Media Arts Alliance (IMAA) will launch an inaugural National Media Arts Prize in June 2014 that will recognize Canadian independent media artists.
We are looking to establish a prize similar to those existing in other arts sectors.  Arts prizes national in scope exist for litterature, visual arts, music, theatre, but there are no prizes that honour the independent media arts exclusively. These cash awards are valued anywhere from 10K – 50K.
What is Independent Media Art? 
The term media arts applies to all forms of time-related or interactive art works that are created by the recording of sounds, visual images, or use new technologies. These art works are creative expressions and encompass the fields of film, audio, video and computer, digital, electronic art. 
It’s exhibited everywhere from art galleries to movie theatres, on the web, in public space and even on cell phones. As technology progresses artists are eager to use new tools to reflect the world around them. Even Salvador Dali who is best known as a surrealist painter experimented in film in the early part of the 20th century. In the 1960’s, video technology was introduced and since then media art has grown to include digital and electronic media. Independent means that the artist initiates and is the driving force behind the work and maintains complete creative control over the work. Media art is all around us.
Independent media artists deliver thought-provoking works, and are continuously challenging our underlying perceptions. Media Artists dedicate their lives to the field; by choosing to maintain complete creative control over their work they make sacrifices, pool resources from a number of sources including their own financial contributions to realize their productions.
As it stands, this critical aspect of the creative process is so crucial as we live in an increasingly commercialized world dominated by mainstream media. Independent media artists contribute to the democratic process by giving voice to individuals within a diverse society. By supporting independent media artists and recognizing their valuable contribution to our everyday lives, we further diversity of vision in artistic expression, technology and social consciousness.
It is important that the winner is selected by a jury of peers, given the nature of independent media art, we feel that a committee of fellow media artists and professionals in the field will be the best people to assess the quality of achievement in terms of creativity, innovation and impact within the sector. 
The IMAA is a member-driven non-profit organization with charitable status working to advance and strengthen the media arts sector in Canada. 
What We Need & What You Get


Our objective is to raise a minimum of 20 000$ to launch this inaugural prize.
The ultimate goal is to award a mid-career artist with a significant cash prize to acknowledge their contributions to the sector and to the cultural community.  Funds raised through this initiative will also be used to promote the artist and the prize by creating a video, purchasing ad space, publishing press releases, and covering travel expenses for the winning artist to attend the National Media Arts Conference taking place in June 2014 where they will be presented with the prize at an award ceremony.
In exchange for your support, we can offer some perks to KiloByte Sponsors, MegaByte Sponsors, GigaByte Sponsors, TeraByte Sponsors, PetaByte Sponsors, ExaByte Sponsors and ZettaByte Sponsors.
If you, or your company wishes to fund the full prize and in an ongoing way, then we could even name the prize after you! In that case, it is best to contact the IMAA directly to develop the prize and the benefits together: (514) 522-8240 www.imaa.ca
The Impact


By establishing a prize like this, we put the spotlight on media artists and their contribution to Canadian society and culture. This prize will encourage many young artists to enter into this dynamic field and empower individuals and communities. We hope to introduce this art form to a larger audience and engage people in this exciting field. Ultimately, we hope to increase visibility of media artists in Canada and abroad, put Canada on the international map for the amazing media art that is being produced here.  Our goal is to strengthen the media arts in Canada and everywhere in the world!
With your help, we want to continue supporting the talented and integral media artists of our nation, but we need the support of the larger community to get this project off the ground!

Résumé
Avec votre aide, l'Alliance des arts médiatiques indépendants (AAMI) souhaite inaugurer le prix des arts médiatiques en juin 2014 qui reconnaîtra les artistes canadiens en arts médiatiques.
Nous cherchons à établir un prix similaire à ceux existant dans les autres secteurs culturels. Les prix en arts de portée nationale existent pour les arts d'écriture, arts visuels, pour la musique, le théâtre, mais il n'existe pas de prix qui rende hommage aux arts médiatiques exclusivement. Ces récompenses sont généralement évaluées autour de 10K - 50K.
Que représentent les arts médiatiques indépendants ?
Le terme arts médiatiques s'applique à toutes les formes d'œuvres d'art liées au temps ou intéractives qui sont créés par l'enregistrement de sons, d'images visuelles, ou par l’utilisation de nouvelles technologies. Ces œuvres d'art sont des expressions créatives qui englobent les domaines du cinéma, de l’audio, de la vidéo et de l’informatique, du numérique, de l'art électronique. 
Exposé partout, des galeries d'art aux salles de cinéma, sur le web, dans l'espace public et même sur les téléphones cellulaires. En même temps que la technologie progresse les artistes sont prêts à utiliser de nouveaux outils afin de refléter le monde qui les entoure. Même Salvador Dali qui est surtout connu comme peintre surréaliste a expérimenté avec le film au début du 20e siècle. Dans les années 1960, la technologie vidéo a été introduite et, depuis, l'art des médias a augmenté pour inclure les médias numériques et électroniques. Indépendant signifie que l'artiste initie et est la force motrice derrière l'œuvre, il maintient un contrôle créatif complet sur son travail. L'art médiatique est tout autour de nous.
Les artistes indépendants en arts médiatiques consacrent leur vie à leur art en continuellement remettant en question nos perceptions sous-jacentes. Les artistes en arts médiatiques consacrent leur vie à ce champ; en choisissant de maintenir un contrôle créatif complet sur leur travail ils font des sacrifices, puisent des ressources à partir d'un certain nombre de sources, y compris en utilisant leurs propres contributions financières pour réaliser leurs productions.
Tel qu'il est, cet aspect critique du processus de création est si importante car nous vivons dans un monde de plus en plus commercialisé dominée par les médias traditionnels. Les artistes indépendants contribuent au processus démocratique en donnant la parole à des individus au sein d'une société diversifiée. En soutenant les artistes indépendants et en reconnaissant leur précieuse contribution à notre vie quotidienne, nous créons de la diversité au sein de l'expression artistique, de la technologie et de la conscience sociale.
Il est important que le lauréat soit choisi par un jury de pairs, compte tenu de la nature des arts médiatiques indépendants, nous pensons qu'un comité d'artistes et de professionnels du milieu seront les mieux placés pour évaluer la qualité des réalisations en termes de créativité, d'innovation et d'impact pour le secteur.L'AAMI est une organisation à but non lucrative dirigée par ses membres qui s'emploie à promouvoir et à renforcer le secteur des arts médiatiques au Canada.
Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez
 Notre objectif est de recueillir un minimum de 20 000 $ pour développer ce prix.L'objectif final est d'attribuer à un artiste en milieu de carrière une bourse importante pour reconnaître sa contribution au secteur et à la communauté culturelle. Les fonds recueillis grâce à cette initiative serviront également à promouvoir l'artiste et le prix en créant une vidéo, l'achat d'espace publicitaire, la publication de communiqués de presse, et couvrira les frais de voyage de l'artiste lauréat pour assister et être présenté lors de l'inauguration de ce prix à la conférence nationale des arts médiatiques qui aura lieu en juin 2014. 
En échange de votre soutien, nous pouvons vous offrir certains avantages qui seront attribués aux sponsors KiloByte, MegaByte, GigaByte, TeraByte, PetaByte, ExaByte and ZettaByte.
Si vous, ou votre entreprise souhaitez financer le prix dans son ensemble et de façon continue, nous pouvons nommer le prix en fonction de vos besoins ! Dans ce cas, il est préférable de contacter directement l'AAMI pour développer le prix et les prestations : (514) 522-8240 www.imaa.ca
L’impact
En établissant un prix comme celui-ci, nous avons mis l'accent sur les artistes médiatiques et à leurs contributions envers la société canadienne et sa culture. Ce prix encourage de nombreux jeunes artistes à entrer dans ce domaine dynamique et à l'autonomisation des individus et des communautés. Nous espérons faire découvrir cette forme d'art à un public plus large et engager les audiences dans ce domaine passionnant. En fin de compte, nous espérons accroître la visibilité des artistes en arts médiatiques au Canada et à l'étranger, positionner le Canada sur la scène internationale de l'art médiatique qui se produit ici. Notre objectif est de renforcer les arts médiatiques au Canada et partout dans le monde ! Avec votre aide, nous voulons continuer à soutenir les artistes talentueux de notre nation, nous avons besoin du soutien d'une communauté pour réaliser ce projet !

<p><b>The Story Behind the Stories</b></p>
<p>Hello.  I am creating
a show that is a blend of storytelling and visual art.  A show that not only entertains and brings
people together but also values the art and act of creation by paying the
artists who make it happen.  Three
tellers – <a href=""http://kaleidoscopecoffee.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">myself</a>, <a href=""http://www.timereneta.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tim Ereneta</a>, and <a href=""http://leahlamb.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.pamfaro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pam Faro</a> – will regale you with daring and
thrilling tales of gods, heroes, adventure, and delight.  Magician <a href=""http://www.mysteriumshow.com/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keith Boudreau</a> will dazzle, amaze and befuddle.  Simultaneously, local Berkeley artist <a href=""http://www.salmaarastu.com/home.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Salma Arastu</a> will draw
<a href=""http://www.salmaarastustudio.com/Drawings_1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">illustrations</a> as she listens to the stories, in a spontaneous act of creativity
and a coming together of storytelling and visual art.  Wednesday, September 25<sup>th</sup> – mark
your calendars for awesomeness!</p>
<p>This show is the first of many and is one step on a larger
path towards the creation of a storytelling coffee shop: <a href=""http://kaleidoscopecoffee.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kaleidoscope – coffee that tells a story</a>.  I’ve worked in and
been in love with coffee for nearly ten years, reveling in the way coffee
brings people together and in the joy of a high-quality, lovingly-made cup of
deliciousness.  About a year and half
ago, I discovered storytelling, and I fell in love again.  At the time, Kaleidoscope Coffee was my small
coffee roasting company in Phoenix,
which I rebranded to bring together my two loves: <a href=""http://kaleidoscopecoffee.com/251/coffee-and-stories-a-magical-combination/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">coffee and stories</a>.  Roughly seven month ago, I relocated from Phoenix to El
  Cerrito, here in the SF Bay Area, and thus began my
journey towards opening a coffee shop that will feature and support
storytelling, music and visual art.</p>
<p>Even though I do not yet have my own space, while I work
towards that, I can promote art and storytelling in the community while also
building an audience for future events – events that pay the artists involved.  This event does that.  Your support makes it possible.</p>
<p><b>Making it Happen – funding for the arts</b></p>
<p>As a backer, your money goes directly to paying the artists
and covering the costs of production.  The
target goal of $700 covers all expenses and pays each artist a nominal
fee.  Roughly half goes to covering the
costs associated with providing the rewards to you the backer.  The remainder goes directly to paying the
artists.  If I do not reach the goal, I
will myself contribute the necessary funds so that I can provide them at least
minimal compensation not only for their time during the show but also for the
numerous hours of research and preparation that goes into telling a quality
story at a professional level.</p>
<p>The exciting idea of exceeding the target goal of $700 has
far reaching implications! <a href=""http://www.thevillageshopsandgalleries.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Village Shops and Gallery</a>, a local art gallery in El Ceritto, has generously donated
their space in support of this event. Additional
funds would allow me to provide them with a monetary Thank You in keeping with
my mission of a holistic support of the arts and local business. Exceeding the target goal of $700 means that I
can pay the artists a more fair amount as well as pay myself.  I am one the storytellers for this event and
have invested hours of my own time to organize it.  Nonetheless, I feel self-conscious asking for
funds to pay myself as well.  One of my
primary goals, both personally and professionally, is to provide a space where
art is truly valued.  So.  Here I am. Asking for your help. </p>
<p>You now have the opportunity to participate in this groundbreaking,
unique event – creating community, hanging out with your friends, hearing some
stimulating and entertaining stories, and seeing some great art, both
spontaneously created and already on display within the gallery!  Woot!</p>
<p><b>Rewards!!<span>  Yay!</span></b></p>
<p>Most of the rewards are fairly straight-forward, but here’s
a few words about some of the details.</p>
<p><b>Thanks! – </b>If I
could give you a real hug, I totally would, but I want you to know: super-duper
thanks! From the bottom of my heart!  And
I want the world to know too, so I’m gonna tell them on my handy-dandy
Kaleidoscope Facebook Page.  The excitement
doesn’t end there – I’ll also mention you on my Kaleidoscope website after the
show!</p>
<p><b>A Larger Community</b>
– If you live in the area, this is your ticket into the show!  If you don't, I sure wish you could be here in person, but you can still be part of the
show.  I’ll send you a url so that you
can watch the show live from the comfort of your own home.  Invite some friends, make some popcorn, and
enjoy!  The campaign ends September 24<sup>th</sup>,
and the show is September 26<sup>th</sup> at 7:30 – “doors” at 7.  This gives a couple days for you to receive
the instructions and ask questions so that it can all go smoothly!</p>
<p><b>An Ongoing Connection</b>
– Relive the memories after watching the show. 
A few days after the show, I’ll send you a link so that you can
digitally download an audio recording and listen to the stories anytime you
want!</p>
<p><b>The Pick-Me-Up</b>
and <b>The All-Nighter</b> – Many of you
have missed my freshly roasted coffee since I relocated from Phoenix
to El Cerrito.  This is for you and anyone else looking for
some really good coffee in the morning.  I’m
not roasting anymore, so since I moved out here, I’ve been hunting around,
trying different local roasters, and let me tell you: there’s a lot of good
ones!  Highwire Coffee does an excellent
job with their roasts – balanced and with a lot of variety in their
selections.  If you sign up for either of
these rewards, I will make sure you receive at least two different kinds of
coffee so that you can experience this goodness and diversity yourself!</p>
<p><b>Art in the Moment</b>
– Prints of the illustrations created during the show will be high-quality
11x14 giclée prints.  After the show, I
will send out surveys with images of the illustrations so that you can choose
which one you would like to receive as a print. 
To receive additional prints, add $50 to your contribution.</p>
<p><b>Big Thanks! </b>To you and everyone!  Thanks for exploring this fun idea with
me.  Thanks for contributing what you are
able.  If you are unable to contribute
monetarily, you can still be a big help by spreading the word among your

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Two weeks from now the the 2012 Individual World Poetry Slam launches in Fayetteville Arkansas. The top 70 poets on planet earth will be meeting on the field of battle to determine who is the next world champion of poetry. Our girl, Steph Holmbo is one of the poets qualified to compete and we need to get her to the dance. Travel to a smaller metropolitan city like Fayetteville is prohibitively expensive. Smaller airports mean higher airfare costs. She will be representing The Intangible Slam of NYC (one of only three poets competing to represent Gotham). This is a MAJOR, MAJOR accomplishment and an enormous oppurtunity for Steph. We NEED to leap into action and throw our support behind her to make sure nothing stops her from getting to Arkansas and delivering a full on HADOUKEN to the rest of the planet's poetry superstars. Hotels, airfare, food, etc. She needs you. We need you. PLEASE HELP</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>- Steph has soared through the ranks of the NYC poetry scene, and yet has twice already been waitlisted or bumped from competing in the last two major tournaments. It has been a labor of love for Steph to keep her chin up through all of this. And now we arrive at the next crucial moment. Help a young artist make her dreams come true. Someone good, kind, and talented who DESERVES this.</p>
<p>- Steph spent the last year donating her time freely to the NYU Slam Team (who just won their first national title). She is one of the most generous and loving young humans you are ever likely to meet. She gives of herself every day she wakes up.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With performing arts education being virtually eliminated from schools today it is more important than ever before to have a program like Hollywood Launch Portland. <em><strong>Hollywood launch Portland students not only learn the performing arts, we teach core values and how to keep your integrity as an artist.</strong></em></p>
<p>Today in there are nearly<em><strong> 12,000 children attending schools that do not have art, dance, drama, or music instruction.</strong></em> The rate of decline for arts education is shockingly steep. Arts and music instruction has been cut by half in many schools, while larger school districts have dropped all arts instruction. <em><strong>Hollywood Launch Portland is filling that gap! </strong></em></p>
<p>Hollywood Launch Portland has a scholarship fund for students that would traditionally get their education in their local school. Our scholarship recipients are extremely talented students that cannot afford the program. We believe that money should never be a factor when it comes to performing arts education. Currently <strong>90%</strong> <em><strong>of Hollywood Launch Portland students are on scholarship, there is a huge need for quality training and funds.</strong></em></p>
<p>We have already given out over 12,000 in scholarships since September. We had to turn people away because we had no more funds available. This was very difficult for us to do knowing the talent that they have and the lack of instruction in the schools.  It is our goal to raise a minimum of 15,000 but we know even at 15,000 we will still have to turn students away. The bottom line the more money we raise, fewer students will have to be turned away.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
With performing arts education being virtually eliminated from schools today it is more important than ever before to have a program like Hollywood Launch Portland. Hollywood launch Portland students not only learn the performing arts, we teach core values and how to keep your integrity as an artist.
Today in there are nearly 12,000 children attending schools that do not have art, dance, drama, or music instruction. The rate of decline for arts education is shockingly steep. Arts and music instruction has been cut by half in many schools, while larger school districts have dropped all arts instruction. Hollywood Launch Portland is filling that gap! 
Hollywood Launch Portland has a scholarship fund for students that would traditionally get their education in their local school. Our scholarship recipients are extremely talented students that cannot afford the program. We believe that money should never be a factor when it comes to performing arts education. Currently 90% of Hollywood Launch Portland students are on scholarship, there is a huge need for quality training and funds.
We have already given out over 12,000 in scholarships since September. We had to turn people away because we had no more funds available. This was very difficult for us to do knowing the talent that they have and the lack of instruction in the schools.  It is our goal to raise a minimum of 15,000 but we know even at 15,000 we will still have to turn students away. The bottom line the more money we raise, fewer students will have to be turned away.


 
Please help us spread the word about Hollywood Launch Portland.....because we all enjoy the arts!!

<p>Hi! I'm Matt Cummings, an artist from Canada. For the last decade or so, I've been drawing pictures for money. Usually big, fancy, flashy explosions and pretty skies but also cute characters and comics.</p>
<p>Last year, I had a lot of fun practicing my portrait/caricature skills via commissions in a cute style. They proved to be pretty popular and, to date, I've completed over 300 of 'em!</p>
<p>But now I want to expand that number! I want to see how many different people I can draw. So many smiling faces! How could I go wrong (:</p>

<p>The beauty of this project is in its simplicity - The second I get your donation/reference photo, I add you to the list and you get a portrait! There isn't even any waiting until after the campaign is over. I'll start drawing and delivering them as I get 'em!</p>
<p><strong>Instructions: email me at matt @ eiffelart.ca with the subject INDIEGOGO and include as many reference photos as you like! Make sure to let me know which email address you paid with (:</strong></p>
<p>You'll recieve a high-resolution (7.2 inches squared at 300dpi) file which you can print out and hang or use on any number of websites or WHATEVER YOU LIKE. It's your face! Use it!</p>
<p>I'm offering a couple different types of portraits, too! You can get a single person portrait (great for gifts!), you can get a 2-person portrait (great for printing out and hangin' on the wall!) (ALSO, since I've been asked, you can totally have your pets in there, too!!)</p>

Story 


Hello
there, my name is Jamie Bizness. 


I
am an artist and one part of a collective comprised of myself and
Rylsee from Switzerland, who I have been collaborating with for the
past year. He has recently returned to his home (Geneva) in hopes of
also raising enough money to attend a show that we have both been
invited to in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 


It
will take place in a major gallery and we have been asked to have a

up of 24 pieces.  Four large acrylic on wood panel 48” x 36”,
eighteen ink on paper illustrations, framed and two  56"" x 48”

I

down there because it was such short notice. I’m not sure I will be
able to raise enough funds on my own, so I am asking for help from

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>First, if you have not listened to the audio/video, I ask that you do before you read this. That is part of my life story. I was raped by my parents from the age of 9-13. Then I was put in the foster system, and raped by one of my foster parents. From that I went into a relationship at the age of 17 years old. I stayed in this relationship, marring this man, for 13 years. In these 13 years, I experienced mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual abuse. This video has reached almost 1000 people, and has helped many walk away from such situations. One such person, was able to get her and her 3 daughters away, and move to another state. Then, she was able to start a Domestic Violence organization there. This is just a small part of my story. My desire now, is, to do a tour of the East Coast, going into any and every door I can get into, with my message of hope, to offer help, and hope to those that feel helpless, and hopeless. Many of these women, go to work, and appear normal every day. Then go home, to fight for their, and even sometimes, their children's and families lives.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My campaign, is a campaign of hope. The lives it will impact, or touch, is way beyond anything I can type on a computer screen. If, a simple audio/video, can stir fathers up to protect their children more, cause mothers to have enough strength to leave DV situations, cause men to say they will not allow their loved ones to be abused any more. What more could hearing it in person do? I refuse to believe, that people will look at this campaign and NOT help me with it. So, I will not even be touching on that base. Through going into open mics, poetry shows, women's groups, and any and every door I can get in, there will be an awesome impact of hope and encouragement...............We are in the middle of designing special t-shirts, and other tools of encouragement to leave with these women. A survivor's kit may be the best way to describe it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I need as much funding as possible, I am believing for at least 10,000. I know that sounds like a lot, but, a Domestic Violence shelter can not pay for me to come speak to their women. A rape crisis center may not be able to pay for me to come speak. I want this first tour to be on the East Coast. I plan on going to no less than 10 states. I also am in need of supplies. I don't want to say something all flowery to these women then leave them hanging. Oh just another person coming through to share their story. I have a mini book ready to go to the printers called ""The Midnight Hour"". This mini book will hold just a few of my inspirational poems, and encouraging words. It will be the size to fit in a back pocket. It is for when they are in their ""Midnight Hour"" and just need that little connection. I do not want to sell these to these women, I want to GIVE them to them...........No matter how much funding I get, I will go on tour. I may not be able to help as many women/men as I want to, but I will help as many as I can.</div>

</div></div>","Our Story

First, if you have not listened to the audio/video, I ask that you do before you read this. That is part of my life story. I was raped by my parents from the age of 9-13. Then I was put in the foster system, and raped by one of my foster parents. From that I went into a relationship at the age of 17 years old. I stayed in this relationship, marring this man, for 13 years. In these 13 years, I experienced mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual abuse. This video has reached almost 1000 people, and has helped many walk away from such situations. One such person, was able to get her and her 3 daughters away, and move to another state. Then, she was able to start a Domestic Violence organization there. This is just a small part of my story. My desire now, is, to do a tour of the East Coast, going into any and every door I can get into, with my message of hope, to offer help, and hope to those that feel helpless, and hopeless. Many of these women, go to work, and appear normal every day. Then go home, to fight for their, and even sometimes, their children's and families lives.


The Impact
My campaign, is a campaign of hope. The lives it will impact, or touch, is way beyond anything I can type on a computer screen. If, a simple audio/video, can stir fathers up to protect their children more, cause mothers to have enough strength to leave DV situations, cause men to say they will not allow their loved ones to be abused any more. What more could hearing it in person do? I refuse to believe, that people will look at this campaign and NOT help me with it. So, I will not even be touching on that base. Through going into open mics, poetry shows, women's groups, and any and every door I can get in, there will be an awesome impact of hope and encouragement...............We are in the middle of designing special t-shirts, and other tools of encouragement to leave with these women. A survivor's kit may be the best way to describe it. 

What We Need & What You Get

I need as much funding as possible, I am believing for at least 10,000. I know that sounds like a lot, but, a Domestic Violence shelter can not pay for me to come speak to their women. A rape crisis center may not be able to pay for me to come speak. I want this first tour to be on the East Coast. I plan on going to no less than 10 states. I also am in need of supplies. I don't want to say something all flowery to these women then leave them hanging. Oh just another person coming through to share their story. I have a mini book ready to go to the printers called ""The Midnight Hour"". This mini book will hold just a few of my inspirational poems, and encouraging words. It will be the size to fit in a back pocket. It is for when they are in their ""Midnight Hour"" and just need that little connection. I do not want to sell these to these women, I want to GIVE them to them...........No matter how much funding I get, I will go on tour. I may not be able to help as many women/men as I want to, but I will help as many as I can.


Funds collected will go towards the following:*Audio Recording, Production and Duplication Costs*Travel and Accommodations while on Tour*Tour and CD Promotional Materials 
*Survivor's Kit (items included will be released soon)
*Publication of books for use on the tour
*Making of T-shirts
*Dinner for me and one ""DV or Rape victim"" per City visited

monotonous existence. Then one morning he awakens in an abandoned 
alleyway; covered in blood and completely naked. After a narrow escape 
from authorities he is captured and imprisoned by a mysterious group who
 seem to possess unusual powers. Suddenly life is anything but boring. 
While learning to develop and utilize mind blowing, incredible abilities
 he is plunged into an unbelievable but very real adventure with evil 
incarnate. Like a great puzzle, pieces of a grand design begin to fit 
and Michael must accept truth and dismiss fiction as he discovers an 
ancient prophecy that threatens all life on this planet and how this 
threat directly relates to him. He must understand that he has a part to
 play in the events that have already been set in motion in the first 
installment of this ultimate theme of good versus evil.</b></p><h3>About Me</h3><p>I am Stephen Alexander, the author of the 
bestselling title: The Book Of Neophyte: The Awakening. The 445 page 
long novel was launched in the fall of 2011 and since then had climbed 
it's way to #2 best selling saga on the biggest e-book site in the 
world. I have had significant exposure in the media including newspaper 
and radio interviews; most notable with the Legendary Fearless Fred of 
102.1 The Edge during prime time with over 1.4 million listeners. Some are posted below so feel free to watch/listen. I am a go-getter, a self-published author; an honest, reliable, friendly true believer that maintains faith that humanity has the will to see itself through anything! I'm a college graduate, painter, sketcher, super-geek, paranormalist, paranoid, truth-seeking, riddle-solving maniac with a thirst for knowledge and a good taste in beer! I've been around the block, through the ringer and in and out of sanity. I never debate a fact unless I'm positive I can win and when I step up to the plate I bring everything I got! I fight tooth and nail for what's right regardless of how long the detour might be or how high the obstacles are. I work hard, I play hard. I don't do drugs but I love to dance. I have many friends and few enemies. I am an Author, an artist, a musician, a teacher, a survivor, a lover and a fighter...And I have one hell of an epic story to tell!!!!!<br/></p><h2><b>Goals</b></h2><p>The purpose of this campaign is to have the The Awakening completely re-edited, re-designed and relaunched. Despite the success of this first installment of an 8-10 part saga, the proofreading and editing wasn't exactly up to standards and I would very much like to have it revamped before it's sequel is released in the summer of 2014. Depending on the success of this campaign I will also be attending Fan Expo/Comic-con this summer to promote the new installment and hopefully a summer book tour as well. <br/></p><p>The success of this campaign will allow for more product and a truly professional outlook on the series; resulting in wider exposure, expansion of the fan base and the professional edge that the series truly deserves. Most importantly in gives you (the investors) the chance to come along with me on what is promising to be one hell of a ride. A ride that will be fully documented along the way!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356741/files/20140208002917-_2_spot.jpg?1391848157"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/356742/files/20140208003038-1493114_464564536988548_1539858407_n.jpg?1391848238"" src="""" style=""width: 567.703px; height: 521px;""/></p><p>If you come to see me in person, Simply mention that you are a pledge on Indiegogo (whether you pledged this project or others) and receive free goodies!

</h3><p>-<b>Proofreading and Editing:</b> A costly process, luckily the editor and proofreader has great faith in my work and has agreed to complete the revamp for a mere $2000. A small fraction of what it usually costs.<br/></p><p>-<b>Promotional Material:</b> Posters, backdrop &amp; table wrap(I already have my originals but would like to update if possible), bookmarks, in-slits, costumes and a few props will cost roughly $3000 (this is the cheapest quote I could get without sacrificing quality)</p><p>-<b>Advertising:</b> A Full scale book launch can cost tens of thousands and up, Through a few connections I was able to secure a local Advertising campaign quote for $2150. This will include Google, Facebook etc...(the basics) Local media print and ads. Depending on success of this campaign, funds will allow for announcements anticipating book signing events in any cities in which I pass through. The more successful the Campaign, the more advertising I can build.<br/></p><p>-<b>Books!:</b> Copies of the book for distribution approx. $2500-$3000 depending on how many hardcovers are required for perks. <br/></p><p>-<b>2014 Book Tour:</b> This will take roughly 4-6 weeks on the road. Any additional funds will pay for travel expenses. (Gas, motels etc...) <br/></p><p>-<b>Book Trailer: </b>This Will require very little as I have made arrangements with a local colleges film students to take on the projects and most decent actors/actresses will work just to add to their portfolio. Mostly props and rental equipment will needed $200-$500.<br/></p><p>-<b>Perks:</b> Filling quotas to deliver the perks you deserve!

Extensive study into subjects that many fear to tread such as Demonology, Spirituality, Religion, Politics, Love, History and so many more. I have many e-mail pertaining to reports of paranormal activity, restoring of faith,  nightmares, even visions believe it or not...seems to vary depending on the reader. This installment is called the Awakening for a very specific reason. Readers will go along with the main character in an unforgettable journey that will awaken the mind, body and soul and allows us to safely question what we have been taught as a society. Concepts that will expand the way we see the living plane and far beyond the afterlife and time itself. What approaches the world we know is a an evolution of spirituality; something humanity truly needs right now.</p><p>This will be my second attempt to back this project. Currently engaged in The Kickstarter program but it seems that people are more interested in video games than anything that may touch your heart or take you through an infinity of possibilities. I know for a fact that print isn't dead so I thought maybe try a more sophisticated crowd. The first launch was fully funded out of my own pocket; a debt that took years to pay off. Hopefully this time around I won't have to do this on my own ;)</p><p>Traditional publishing is an option but because of the books controversial topis (...and there are and will be many) I have been told that I have to dumb down or remove what publishers seem to think the world isn't ready for. I call bullsh#t! I think the world needs something fresh, honest, raw and unyielding for a change. But hey, you be the judge.</p><p><b>If you cannot afford to give much, I am more than willing to send you a copy of the original e-book; free of charge.

two
separate sexes?’ I probe, hoping that she can shine some light on the 
subject. ‘To understand, you must see the Holy Trinity for what it is. 
People often
confuse the three entities as a singular being. Like any form of order 
and
affection, the Holy Trinity is actually a family. The father being the 
final
word and the firm hand of discipline; the Holy Spirit being the mother 
figure,
the compassion and affection that only a mother can give; and of course 
the
son. He is the Neophyte of the three; the constantly learning being of 
hope and
knowledge. A hybrid of both discipline and compassion, yet born as a 
human.It really is quite moving when you
think about it. These ideals are set upon humanity naturally yet so many
 look
down upon women because of it.’ </p><p>‘What do you mean?’ I ask. ‘Well, the Vatican
has a real problem with women. They made sure to take out any reference of the
Holy Spirit as a female entity. By doing so it began a long and enduring battle
for women seeking any kind of equal rights.’ The sound of her voice is rather

monotonous existence. Then one morning he awakens in an abandoned 
alleyway; covered in blood and completely naked. After a narrow escape 
from authorities he is captured and imprisoned by a mysterious group who
 seem to possess unusual powers. Suddenly life is anything but boring. 
While learning to develop and utilize mind blowing, incredible abilities
 he is plunged into an unbelievable but very real adventure with evil 
incarnate. Like a great puzzle, pieces of a grand design begin to fit 
and Michael must accept truth and dismiss fiction as he discovers an 
ancient prophecy that threatens all life on this planet and how this 
threat directly relates to him. He must understand that he has a part to
 play in the events that have already been set in motion in the first 
installment of this ultimate theme of good versus evil.About MeI am Stephen Alexander, the author of the 
bestselling title: The Book Of Neophyte: The Awakening. The 445 page 
long novel was launched in the fall of 2011 and since then had climbed 
it's way to #2 best selling saga on the biggest e-book site in the 
world. I have had significant exposure in the media including newspaper 
and radio interviews; most notable with the Legendary Fearless Fred of 
102.1 The Edge during prime time with over 1.4 million listeners. Some are posted below so feel free to watch/listen. I am a go-getter, a self-published author; an honest, reliable, friendly true believer that maintains faith that humanity has the will to see itself through anything! I'm a college graduate, painter, sketcher, super-geek, paranormalist, paranoid, truth-seeking, riddle-solving maniac with a thirst for knowledge and a good taste in beer! I've been around the block, through the ringer and in and out of sanity. I never debate a fact unless I'm positive I can win and when I step up to the plate I bring everything I got! I fight tooth and nail for what's right regardless of how long the detour might be or how high the obstacles are. I work hard, I play hard. I don't do drugs but I love to dance. I have many friends and few enemies. I am an Author, an artist, a musician, a teacher, a survivor, a lover and a fighter...And I have one hell of an epic story to tell!!!!!GoalsThe purpose of this campaign is to have the The Awakening completely re-edited, re-designed and relaunched. Despite the success of this first installment of an 8-10 part saga, the proofreading and editing wasn't exactly up to standards and I would very much like to have it revamped before it's sequel is released in the summer of 2014. Depending on the success of this campaign I will also be attending Fan Expo/Comic-con this summer to promote the new installment and hopefully a summer book tour as well. The success of this campaign will allow for more product and a truly professional outlook on the series; resulting in wider exposure, expansion of the fan base and the professional edge that the series truly deserves. Most importantly in gives you (the investors) the chance to come along with me on what is promising to be one hell of a ride. A ride that will be fully documented along the way!If you come to see me in person, Simply mention that you are a pledge on Indiegogo (whether you pledged this project or others) and receive free goodies! No questions asked.Expenses 
-Proofreading and Editing: A costly process, luckily the editor and proofreader has great faith in my work and has agreed to complete the revamp for a mere $2000. A small fraction of what it usually costs.-Promotional Material: Posters, backdrop & table wrap(I already have my originals but would like to update if possible), bookmarks, in-slits, costumes and a few props will cost roughly $3000 (this is the cheapest quote I could get without sacrificing quality)-Advertising: A Full scale book launch can cost tens of thousands and up, Through a few connections I was able to secure a local Advertising campaign quote for $2150. This will include Google, Facebook etc...(the basics) Local media print and ads. Depending on success of this campaign, funds will allow for announcements anticipating book signing events in any cities in which I pass through. The more successful the Campaign, the more advertising I can build.-Books!: Copies of the book for distribution approx. $2500-$3000 depending on how many hardcovers are required for perks. -2014 Book Tour: This will take roughly 4-6 weeks on the road. Any additional funds will pay for travel expenses. (Gas, motels etc...) -Book Trailer: This Will require very little as I have made arrangements with a local colleges film students to take on the projects and most decent actors/actresses will work just to add to their portfolio. Mostly props and rental equipment will needed $200-$500.-Perks: Filling quotas to deliver the perks you deserve! The best quality with the most gratitude for your generous contribution.

Bookmarks (4of 12)The ImpactThis Book will be but the falling stone of a following avalanche; The result of over 4 years of hard work and decades of research. Extensive study into subjects that many fear to tread such as Demonology, Spirituality, Religion, Politics, Love, History and so many more. I have many e-mail pertaining to reports of paranormal activity, restoring of faith,  nightmares, even visions believe it or not...seems to vary depending on the reader. This installment is called the Awakening for a very specific reason. Readers will go along with the main character in an unforgettable journey that will awaken the mind, body and soul and allows us to safely question what we have been taught as a society. Concepts that will expand the way we see the living plane and far beyond the afterlife and time itself. What approaches the world we know is a an evolution of spirituality; something humanity truly needs right now.This will be my second attempt to back this project. Currently engaged in The Kickstarter program but it seems that people are more interested in video games than anything that may touch your heart or take you through an infinity of possibilities. I know for a fact that print isn't dead so I thought maybe try a more sophisticated crowd. The first launch was fully funded out of my own pocket; a debt that took years to pay off. Hopefully this time around I won't have to do this on my own ;)Traditional publishing is an option but because of the books controversial topis (...and there are and will be many) I have been told that I have to dumb down or remove what publishers seem to think the world isn't ready for. I call bullsh#t! I think the world needs something fresh, honest, raw and unyielding for a change. But hey, you be the judge.If you cannot afford to give much, I am more than willing to send you a copy of the original e-book; free of charge. Simply like my Facebook page and send me a message titled ""gimme gimme"" along with an e-mail address (I refuse to spam! You have my word.) and the copy is yours to enjoy ($9.99 value) until the closing of the project period. My gift to you in hope that you will spread the word and make some noise about the campaign and The Book of Neophyte series! The choice to wait for the revamp is entirely yours :) and don't forget to use the Indiegogo Share tools!!!Conceptual Art (1 of hundreds)Sample: Chapter 7, Page 77. ‘Why did Samael refer to God as 
two
separate sexes?’ I probe, hoping that she can shine some light on the 
subject. ‘To understand, you must see the Holy Trinity for what it is. 
People often
confuse the three entities as a singular being. Like any form of order 
and
affection, the Holy Trinity is actually a family. The father being the 
final
word and the firm hand of discipline; the Holy Spirit being the mother 
figure,
the compassion and affection that only a mother can give; and of course 
the
son. He is the Neophyte of the three; the constantly learning being of 
hope and
knowledge. A hybrid of both discipline and compassion, yet born as a 
human.It really is quite moving when you
think about it. These ideals are set upon humanity naturally yet so many
 look
down upon women because of it.’ ‘What do you mean?’ I ask. ‘Well, the Vatican
has a real problem with women. They made sure to take out any reference of the
Holy Spirit as a female entity. By doing so it began a long and enduring battle
for women seeking any kind of equal rights.’ The sound of her voice is rather
soothing and as I take her explanation with a grain of salt, the sense of
strong womanhood is felt within her sentences. She continues as we slowly move
along a vast expansive hallway lined with exquisite paintings and statues. ‘The
chauvinistic men who rewrote the scriptures absolutely refused to believe that
a woman could possibly have a hand in their own creation. This is what sculpted
generations after generations of male chauvinism amongst men. Imagine a world
where we’re all treated as equals. It’s really only the tip of the iceberg. God
gives us a gift that would ensure peace on earth and men find a way to use it
as a means of control. Their hypocrisy truly has no bounds. Women play a much
broader part in the guidance and overall being of human development than most
people give us credit for. Take the order of the average family to its roots
and how the individuals who are part of that family unit really feel and you
will find that nurturing will usually come naturally to the mother figure and
discipline with the father figure. Men need that assurance of control over the
entire unit for some strange reason. Personally I see it as a flaw rather than
a blessing, simply because it’s carried too far.’ ‘So you’re saying that
control over the family is something that is given to the male because that’s
what we need to function within the family unit?’ ‘It’s nothing personal and
the position is there regardless of gender.’ Okay, now I’m confused. ‘Michael; in
every relationship whether it be gay or straight, there is always one who wears
the pants and one who is more nurturing and compassionate. Fatherhood and
motherhood is a position in the unit regardless of gender.’

‘Speaking of gifts, something has
been bugging me. How is it that you can do the things that you do?’ She
stumbles on her words before she answers, possibly unsure how to explain it.
‘We..., I.... Okay; you’ve heard of psychic abilities?’ I’m confused. A comical
vision of Samael hovering over a crystal ball makes me chuckle slightly.
‘Psychics? Like gypsies or something?’ I try to relate. ‘Well, it’s based on
that principal,’ she responds. ‘Every being is capable of such abilities;
unfortunately, we have all been programmed to dismiss anything that may be even
the slightest bit extraordinary. Society exiles those who are different; which
is fine by me. They laugh at us because we are different. We laugh at them,
because they are all the same. We must learn to accept that we are the same in
many ways but as human beings we are of wondrous variety. If mankind ever
embraced this, they would find a personal power that is as unique as their
fingerprints.’

excel in the extraordinary and as a Neophyte, you will learn what this world
really is and embrace your natural talents. No tricks, illusions or lies to
blind you from your destiny.’",7.0,2,"1 Campaign
