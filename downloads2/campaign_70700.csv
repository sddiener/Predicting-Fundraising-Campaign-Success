</p><p>We
are excited to introduce the Trim-Daddy, an innovative new handheld electric
trimmer that revolutionizes the process of trimming.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As
more and more states legalize the production of cannabis, the competition is
heating up and prices are going down. The growers that make it in this industry
are finding more and more ways to cut costs, and one of a grower's biggest
costs in time and money is the process of trimming.</p>
<p>For
years we've all been spending our valuable hours trimming with traditional
scissors or paying up to $200 per pound for someone else to trim, which is a
huge drain on time and money.</p>
<p>The
Trim-Daddy is specifically designed for trimming your buds with speed and
accuracy, giving your growing operation the efficiency it needs to stay
competitive. Our consumer tests resulted in an average trimming time of 1.5
hours per pound, which is 5 times faster than traditional scissors. At that
speed, and with our Indiegogo campaign's price of $99, the Trim-Daddy pays for
itself on the first day.</p>
<p>With
the tremendous savings and accuracy that the Trim-Daddy gives growers and
trimmers, the question isn't if you need to have it, but when you'll give your
operation the proper tools it deserves.</p>

saw-type blades found with other electric trimmers, our blades are designed to
snip only what you intend to snip and keep your bud beautiful.</p>
<p>Our
blades work just like scissors except a lot faster and nearly effortless for
your hands. They are made of high carbon stainless steel for longevity of use,
and are easily removed for cleaning.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456772859/qg77ez30kihrcq6mhdzg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>2. Patent pending Robust Motor</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
Robust Motor is the heart of the Trim-Daddy. We have specially designed and
engineered this Patent-Pending Brushless Motor to last over 10,000 hours at
full speed, while the brush motors found in most other trimmers last only 2,000
hours. This will allow you to use the Trim-Daddy for years without having any
heart problems.</p>
<p>The
powerful 25,000 RPM motor, longevity of use, and overall efficiency of the
Robust Motor allows it to maintain a strong performance through even the
toughest and stickiest of trim jobs. You can choose between two speed options
that allow you to stay in control of power.</p>
<p>We
combine a specific variety of metals to craft the motor such in a way that
reacts perfectly to our unique treatment process. This allows for the motor to
be immaculately smooth on a microscopic level, enabling years of use without
overheating. It has been tested to produce more power with less energy for
optimal efficiency. Our brushless motor technology has also been designed to
not exceed a temperature of 137 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing you to work for
hours without overheating.</p>
<p>The
Robust Motor is currently patent pending and is found exclusively in the
Trim-Daddy.</p>

<p>The

Trimming is a pain, but doesn’t have to be. The
Trim-Daddy revolutionizes the process of trimming by using advanced technology
to do most of the work for you. It helps you do the work faster, thickens your
wallet, and saves your hands for times you need them most.


The
Trim-Daddy is currently in production and will be complete and sent to your
home in March 2016. We have invested $100,000 into our first round of
production and another $50,000 this past half year for our warehouse rent and
other overhead costs. Rest assured that our company is fully operational and
ready to deliver a Trim-Daddy with your pledge of only $99.
The
Trim-Daddy will be available in hydroponics retail stores across the nation
upon its release date in March. We decided to launch this Indiegogo campaign to
get a head start with our product release and to reward our early supporters
with a Trim-Daddy at half its retail cost for helping us doing so.
Pledge
for yours today and get one for just 99 bucks. Get ahead of the game and order
yours today!


$99 on Indiegogo, $199 retail. Don’t wait! 
The Trim-Daddy in these photos is a
3D printed version we have for testing. The actual Trim-Daddy will have the
same look but will also have a nice bubbled Trim-Daddy logo on its side.

Sharing is caring

Risks
and challenges

The
product is currently in production, and so far everything has gone as planned.
The only potential obstacles is a slight delay in manufacturing, which can
happen with any product even with a promise from the production end. To avoid this, we have set preliminary agreements with our manufactures to
complete the the product by a certain date. We even gave an extra 2 week leeway
for any unexpected delays.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

About ME:

My name is Simon Roy orinally from Laval, QC, Canada.
Ph.D in Animal Physiology (endocrinology option)
B.Sc in Biotechnology
Passionate about all types of sciences for as long as I can remember.
Always wanted to contribute to 'changing the world' but didn't know how...
Founded Civic Bioscience Limitée on Sept 15th, 2015 from A to Z, without any funding, with a mission of providing Good Citizenship to the field of Life Science Research.


About Civic Bio (www.civicbio.com):

We (I) started off the company a year ago by doing distribution of life science research reagents that are intended to be used for research only.
Our goal is to find the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) that make products/kits for big companies so that we can provide lower cost to customers by NOT doing private labelling.
We wish to expand and provide services.


Origins of the Project:




 Biology scientists (cancer, reproduction , agriculture, etc. ) are facing day-to-day problems .
Solving their problems themself, often by trying out new reagents, is costly and it slows scientific discoveries.

Last February, we offered a group of scientist to help them solve a problem of DNA
amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We solved their problem quickly while they could continue research on non-problematic parts of their research. Since then, we solved a dozen of similar probems (read about it here: PCR Success Stories).
Thus, we realized that :



the need was
present in several research laboratories;

it makes researchers happy when we find answers to their problems;
they save valuable time and money;
we made more sales by providing our technical help.


The Main Project you will be financing:

So far we have solved basic low-throughput problems but science being what it is requires higher throughput and diverse equipment to perform biological experiments.

We wish to be able to solve scientist problems of other nature (for exemple: quantitative measurement of nucleic acid expression levels) which require more technologically advanced equipment,
High technology means higher amounts of reagents wasted by researchers at the moment, which also means we will be saving them that much money (coming from our taxes!)
Provide this service for FREE - Good Citizenship - we will get enough from the sales afterwards.

Why this project is important:

Life Science research is majorly funded by the taxes we, the citizens, pay everyday. Saving Research money = more research, more cures, better food, better pest control or alternatively more investments in other areas.

Change the World - by setting a new way to do business in the life science research field.
Better than a donation - you will really help ACCELERATE scientific discoveries.




What we NEED and what you GET

What we have (equipment):
miniPCR DNA Discovery system by Amplyus (founded on Kickstarter)


Works great!
Low cost, but low throughput, basic PCR instrument enabling us to perform only 8 reaction at a time. Similar machines in research labs can do 96 to 384 reactions, have temperature gradients and many other options.

We need :


Quantitative PCR thermocycler (10 000 to 20 000$ with accessories) to be able to perform advanced measurements of nucleic acid expression in a high-throughput fasion.


Benchtop Laboratory Refrigerated Centrifuge and Rotors (approx. 10 000$ with rotor and shipping). It's basic equipment that will allow us to perform nucleic acid and other sample extraction and purification.

Consumable plasticware and reagents (5000$)
Extra 5000$ for IndieGogo perks, shipping fees and other fees.

Where the money will go if we don't reach our target:

If not entirely funded, we will use the money to purchase the basic minimum equipment strting by the centrifuge and we will downgrade the PCR machine to a regular 96-well thermocycler without quantitative measurement function. The equipment will still be used to help scientists with their challenges.

I’m 5’1’’, I have short hair, and I’m a tax preparer who started her own company called, The Tax Corner. I wasn’t always into the business side or taxes or accounting, I was more into fitness and athletics. As I entered my final year in high school, I was introduced to taxes and accounting heavily, when I took a class on these subjects. In school, I was very successful with each form I completed. <em>Taxes were, simple </em>in my opinion. Once I graduated, I went to college for my bachelor in business. With a nearly 4.0 GPA, business seemed easy as well. It wasn’t until my grandmother needed help on her taxes that I did a complete 180 spin, and decided I had to reach out to the community; who knew how many were out there just like my grandmother! My grandmother didn’t want to go wait for four hours in a gym to get her taxes done for free, she just wished she could have them done quicker. Standing to long made her uncomfortable, and she’d have to stand for at least an hour before a seat opened up, and once a seat was open she planned on waiting another three hours. When she was discussing this with me, I was overcome with a feeling of remorse, I felt like I should have known this, or I should be able to do something for her… and I did. I told my grandmother to give me her current tax season material and her last year tax season material and I would file them for her. Of course within an hour and a half I was finished, and I called my grandmother and told her whenever she wants to come sign and I would be available. With this, my fire was lit. I was kicked into gear to start a company so that people who are just like my grandmother can file their taxes for free. I went to work; taking classes, getting certified, researching, finding out prices and to my surprise, filing taxes is not cheap. So I changed my focus from only the elderly to everyone. With this in mind I knew I would need more money than I had in the bank to cover all my startup costs, thus this campaign was born.<br/></p><p><strong>Importance of the campaign/what it is funding: </strong>This campaign is personal for me. It’s so important to help the community, especially during the tax season. People don’t quite understand taxes and it’s our jobs as tax professionals to help them get an understanding, not drive them bankrupt until their income taxes come in. I was very uncomfortable with the information I found about prices that big companies and sole proprietors-like me-charge people so much. I decided that, I would not come up with a price, instead I’d do it for free. I’d prepare taxes for free and give my community a break, hoping to someday expand to place my free offices everywhere. With this campaign I am asking for help raising $15,000. With this $15,000 I will be able to cover the costs for the following;<br/></p><ul>
<li>Computer (desktop)<br/>
</li>
<li>Fax/Printer<br/>
</li>
<li>Scanner<br/>
</li>
<li>Tax Software<br/>
</li>
<li>Cover website and email fees<br/>
</li>
<li>Cover ads in the newspaper and online fees<br/>
</li>
<li>Marketing materials<br/>
</li>
<li>Phone line and installing fees<br/>
</li>
<li>Office materials, etc<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>This list is a few of the bigger fees I am hoping to tackle with this campaign. Your donations will make an outstanding impact, not only on The Tax Corner, however on the Buffalo community. It will make tax season a little simpler for all. I hope to raise the entire amount, however if I am not able to raise this, I will use whatever donations I receive on these startup costs. Each donation counts, and no matter the amount, each donation will be used for my business. As well as anyone who can’t donate, putting the word out not only about my campaign, but about my business would be just as good as any donation!<br/></p><p>       <strong>How this campign is valuable to you:</strong>  This project is not only of value to me and the Buffalo community, but it will be of value to you. When you donate, your proceeds are the difference between someone over paying for their taxes to be filed and someone filing for free with me. You are helping me make difference to the people who pay their last dime to get their taxes filed and have to wait until their income tax checks come in before they can pay another bill, put food on the table, pay for their child’s lunch. This campaign is a big responsibility and with your help, you are helping me open a valuable door to the community. With your help, I can avoid all risks of no customers. I can advertise and give out marketing materials to bring people in and secure a clientele. With your help, this tax season can be the season that will bring families a little closer, make pockets a little fatter, put a little extra joy in the homes of all. I’m not hoping to serve only the low income community, but to serve, everyone, everywhere! We all deserve a break. If you’re ever in the Buffalo area during tax season, come visit us and see how your donation has made a difference! Thank you for your donation.<br/></p><p>Sincerely,<br/></p><p>The Tax Corner: Taxes made simple<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","Background: Hi, my name is Angie Garris.

Taxes were, simple in my opinion. Once I graduated, I went to college for my bachelor in business. With a nearly 4.0 GPA, business seemed easy as well. It wasn’t until my grandmother needed help on her taxes that I did a complete 180 spin, and decided I had to reach out to the community; who knew how many were out there just like my grandmother! My grandmother didn’t want to go wait for four hours in a gym to get her taxes done for free, she just wished she could have them done quicker. Standing to long made her uncomfortable, and she’d have to stand for at least an hour before a seat opened up, and once a seat was open she planned on waiting another three hours. When she was discussing this with me, I was overcome with a feeling of remorse, I felt like I should have known this, or I should be able to do something for her… and I did. I told my grandmother to give me her current tax season material and her last year tax season material and I would file them for her. Of course within an hour and a half I was finished, and I called my grandmother and told her whenever she wants to come sign and I would be available. With this, my fire was lit. I was kicked into gear to start a company so that people who are just like my grandmother can file their taxes for free. I went to work; taking classes, getting certified, researching, finding out prices and to my surprise, filing taxes is not cheap. So I changed my focus from only the elderly to everyone. With this in mind I knew I would need more money than I had in the bank to cover all my startup costs, thus this campaign was born.Importance of the campaign/what it is funding: This campaign is personal for me. It’s so important to help the community, especially during the tax season. People don’t quite understand taxes and it’s our jobs as tax professionals to help them get an understanding, not drive them bankrupt until their income taxes come in. I was very uncomfortable with the information I found about prices that big companies and sole proprietors-like me-charge people so much. I decided that, I would not come up with a price, instead I’d do it for free. I’d prepare taxes for free and give my community a break, hoping to someday expand to place my free offices everywhere. With this campaign I am asking for help raising $15,000. With this $15,000 I will be able to cover the costs for the following;
Computer (desktop)

Fax/Printer

Scanner

Tax Software

Cover website and email fees

Cover ads in the newspaper and online fees

Marketing materials

Phone line and installing fees

Office materials, etc

This list is a few of the bigger fees I am hoping to tackle with this campaign. Your donations will make an outstanding impact, not only on The Tax Corner, however on the Buffalo community. It will make tax season a little simpler for all. I hope to raise the entire amount, however if I am not able to raise this, I will use whatever donations I receive on these startup costs. Each donation counts, and no matter the amount, each donation will be used for my business. As well as anyone who can’t donate, putting the word out not only about my campaign, but about my business would be just as good as any donation!       How this campign is valuable to you:  This project is not only of value to me and the Buffalo community, but it will be of value to you. When you donate, your proceeds are the difference between someone over paying for their taxes to be filed and someone filing for free with me. You are helping me make difference to the people who pay their last dime to get their taxes filed and have to wait until their income tax checks come in before they can pay another bill, put food on the table, pay for their child’s lunch. This campaign is a big responsibility and with your help, you are helping me open a valuable door to the community. With your help, I can avoid all risks of no customers. I can advertise and give out marketing materials to bring people in and secure a clientele. With your help, this tax season can be the season that will bring families a little closer, make pockets a little fatter, put a little extra joy in the homes of all. I’m not hoping to serve only the low income community, but to serve, everyone, everywhere! We all deserve a break. If you’re ever in the Buffalo area during tax season, come visit us and see how your donation has made a difference! Thank you for your donation.Sincerely,The Tax Corner: Taxes made simple",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

not work out well. The virus continued destroying life, young and old.</span><br/></p>

served as advisers in the barangay. The eldest of them called the elders to a
meeting. One of them believed that the epidemic was a punishment from heaven. One
could imagine that deaths occurred every now and then. The group agreed to ask
and pray to God through the Patron Saint Senior San Vicente Ferrer. On the

Chapel

San Vicente Chapel is a humble establishment devoted to
their deep-rooted faith and a love for the Christian religion. For the
villagers within the community, San Vicente Chapel is the core of the community's
strength and a place to worship the love for God and their savior Jesus Christ. The chapel is overseen by Father Cruf F. Climaco, St. Anthony of Padua Parish, Anahawan, Southern Leyte.Inside the existing San Vicente ChapelThe local parishioners whom attend San Vicente commit much of their lives and
time to promoting community growth and development through hard work, social
unity and educating future generations the importance of handing down necessary
family and community traditions critical to their survival as a people. It is because
of San Vicente Chapel that many local parishioners are afforded opportunities
they would not otherwise have had. We would now like to request your generous
help in making sure this community could continue to grow and develop.Community BackgroundThe remote village of San Vicente is one of 14 Barangays
within Anahawan; a province of Sothern Leyte located in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippine
Islands and considered the second least populated region of the Philippines. Much
of the surrounding areas of San Vicente experiences yearly rainfalls of over 60
inches on average lending to devastating landslides and extreme flooding. The community
of San Vicente itself depends exclusively upon self-sustaining efforts and the sharing
of those efforts with others within the community. Farming and fishing are an
important way of life and help provide needed food for the local villagers. The
entire community lives off what they can trade, grow, sow and catch. Fisherman
generally begin fishing at 3 am and continue their efforts until sundown every
day. While some of the fish is consumed as a food, it is also traded for other
goods and services within the community. Farming mainly consists of growing
small amounts of rice and vegetables (known as the vegi 7). Another essential
farm crop includes coconut, which is one of the most important crops of the
region. In addition to crops, farming of animals such as pigs, chickens and caribou
are also important resources for sustaining the community. The people
of San Vicente understand the importance of sharing and giving to the
community to promote continued growth and development.A Community's StoryThis story was related by Flaviano Butalon, the oldest man
in the barangay during the early part of the 19th century.
Long time ago, barangay San Vicente, a place best suited to
farming and fishing, was peaceful and orderly. The people were hardworking and
the lifestyle was simple and happy. One day, the barrio (now barangay) was
greatly disturbed by the dangerous and contagious disease Cholera; a terrible
epidemic which caused deaths every day.
During that time, no medical doctors could be found but
quack doctors. Herbal medicines and oracion (Latin prayers whispered to the
patients. Some used their saliva as medicines spitted at the center of the head
during said orations. Unfortunately, those herbal medicines and orations did
not work out well. The virus continued destroying life, young and old.
The elders are very much respected by the people. They
served as advisers in the barangay. The eldest of them called the elders to a
meeting. One of them believed that the epidemic was a punishment from heaven. One
could imagine that deaths occurred every now and then. The group agreed to ask
and pray to God through the Patron Saint Senior San Vicente Ferrer. On the
shoulders of four men, hearty and serious procession (praying and singing on
the way) was done around the barangay in ocho ocho form.
After several procession, untoward deaths stopped. From then
on, the people made the prayers, novena and procession every Friday evening at
6pm. The said old chapel is located where the barangay hall is situated today.The succeeding generations have relied on the heavenly
assistance of Sr. San Vicente Ferrer. Those who migrated to other places come
home to attend prayers, novena and procession. During the fiesta of Sr. San
Vicente Ferrer, others send their donations for the chapel as a sign of
gratitude for the countless blessings and graces received through the intercession
of our beloved Patron Sr. San Vicente Ferrer.

Why We Started This Campaign
This campaign emerged out of a desire to help people I didn't even know. Until recent, I had never heard of San Vicente, nevertheless there was a community of Christians working hard to complete renovations of their chapel. Through a friend, I had heard that the entire community was trying to complete their chapel and only needed a small amount of materials to complete the outside. 








As you can see by the pictures, San Vicente Chapel is in need of valued and appreciated materials to finish the outside shell of the structure and protect their very sacred alter from the coming rains (average days of rainfall each year are 160). 
Although they have all the needed labor, which is being volunteered by the community, as well as local tradesman are, the materials to finish the chapel are not able to be purchased because of the low income status of the community. 
Without the needed materials, the efforts of the community can not progress toward their goal of having a new chapel to maintain their strong community bond, which is held together by their Christian faith. 

What the Money Will Be Used For
The donations collected through the global community will be used to purchase materials needed to finish the outside. Those materials include:



Outside Shell Materials - $3500.00 approx.


Roofing Materials - $2500.00 approx.


Reaching a goal of $6000.00 will be a true blessing and greatly appreciated by people whom understand the importance of sharing and giving to promote community growth. 

How You Can Help?


Please give what you can - every dollar will make a
difference and even if you can't contribute financially, you can help share
our story with your family and friends via Facebook, Twitter and other social
media. We want to reach as many people as we can in the global community.
We truly thank you for whatever you may be able to do.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Bay Area hardships of finding housing--problematic for artists, activists; tiny home community in urban setting, solutions...

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p></p><p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p><p>Hi, I'm Adrian, I moved from New York to S. Florida five years ago. As a hobby and a way to make new friends, I started running unique and creative group events in S. Florida to get out of the bored rut. After a while it took on a life of its own. Once I started our first few events and saw how much fun it was bringing strangers together, it fueled my obsession of doing this on a much broader scale. It brings me great joy when members rave about how much fun they had, or how they met a new friend at one of our events. See testimonials below. This funding will help me start a massive marketing campaign. Thus allowing for many new members in your area and expanding into several new cities. Look for us in your city soon.</p><p>You can see pictures and types of events at <a href=""http://www.meetmethereevents.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MeetMeThereEvents.com</a></p><p>Before moving I owned an event planning business in NYC for over 18 years. Having worked for clients who were planning such important private events, I became highly skilled in being detailed oriented, diligent, resourceful and creative. After exiting the private party world, I went on to become a Licensed Realtor for RE/MAX. But, they say, ""Do what you love and you'll love what you do"". Well, I love running this group and want to do it full time. I've never had so much fun in my life creating fun for other people.</p><p>Your contributions are actually not for me. They are for the members. As they are the recipients of this service. Life is filled with work, families, stress, bills and plenty of adult seriousness. Members need our group as an outlet to express their inner kid and to have more laughter and enjoyment in their lives. Because we do these as group events, they benefit by meeting many new friends that they wouldn't normally meet in their daily lives.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>$25,000 is what it would take to get it started. I have been out of pocket for all costs associated with running this group. However, I have devised a very affordable member fee that helps in the cost of running the group. It's extremely affordable with no pressure to participate if they can't. Unlike a similar group who charges over 100 times what we do. Plus, they limit the membership to a year. Once our members pay very affordable annual fee.</p><p>A small portion would be for legal fees. Incorporation fees, liability agreement, a few web page enhancements etc.. The Majority, approximately $20,000, would be used to run radio spots for approximately 8 - 10 months consistently. It would not be spent all at once. Between, $1,500 and $2,000 a month would be spent on this marketing. This would allow for consistency and more importantly, letting me see the conversion rate after 90 days. The marketing will drive traffic to our web site and increase membership.</p><p>If the goal is not met, I will still use the funds in the same manner and begin marketing. I will work hard as continuing to raise the balance from angels and out of pocket myself.</p><p>One perk offered to any contributor would be a complimentary membership.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Not only do we plan events for our members but, we post information about charities, community events and encourage them to get involved. From time to time we actually plan an outing that brings our members to a charity event such as when we did the ""Walk for MS"", or ""beach cleanup"". Part of my plan is to be able to grow the membership and have recurring community events that we can actively participate in on a regular basis. Part of our blog is dedicated to allowing members to post information about charitable events or non profits. This gives them an outlet to share with other members. My goal is to be a bigger part of the community.</p><p>My success is the fact that I have planned over 200 events and brought many new friendships to life. Your contribution will allow people who are looking for more social interaction, the ability to do so more frequently without costing and arm and a leg. Plainly put, I am a people person. I work hard at fulfilling my members needs and wants and put them first before mine.

As a hobby and a way to make new friends, I started running unique and creative group events in S. Florida to get out of the bored rut. After a while it took on a life of its own. Once I started our first few events and saw how much fun it was bringing strangers together, it fueled my obsession of doing this on a much broader scale. It brings me great joy when members rave about how much fun they had, or how they met a new friend at one of our events. See testimonials below. This funding will help me start a massive marketing campaign. Thus allowing for many new members in your area and expanding into several new cities. Look for us in your city soon.You can see pictures and types of events at www.MeetMeThereEvents.comBefore moving I owned an event planning business in NYC for over 18 years. Having worked for clients who were planning such important private events, I became highly skilled in being detailed oriented, diligent, resourceful and creative. After exiting the private party world, I went on to become a Licensed Realtor for RE/MAX. But, they say, ""Do what you love and you'll love what you do"". Well, I love running this group and want to do it full time. I've never had so much fun in my life creating fun for other people.Your contributions are actually not for me. They are for the members. As they are the recipients of this service. Life is filled with work, families, stress, bills and plenty of adult seriousness. Members need our group as an outlet to express their inner kid and to have more laughter and enjoyment in their lives. Because we do these as group events, they benefit by meeting many new friends that they wouldn't normally meet in their daily lives.What We Need & What You Get$25,000 is what it would take to get it started. I have been out of pocket for all costs associated with running this group. However, I have devised a very affordable member fee that helps in the cost of running the group. It's extremely affordable with no pressure to participate if they can't. Unlike a similar group who charges over 100 times what we do. Plus, they limit the membership to a year. Once our members pay very affordable annual fee.A small portion would be for legal fees. Incorporation fees, liability agreement, a few web page enhancements etc.. The Majority, approximately $20,000, would be used to run radio spots for approximately 8 - 10 months consistently. It would not be spent all at once. Between, $1,500 and $2,000 a month would be spent on this marketing. This would allow for consistency and more importantly, letting me see the conversion rate after 90 days. The marketing will drive traffic to our web site and increase membership.If the goal is not met, I will still use the funds in the same manner and begin marketing. I will work hard as continuing to raise the balance from angels and out of pocket myself.One perk offered to any contributor would be a complimentary membership.The ImpactNot only do we plan events for our members but, we post information about charities, community events and encourage them to get involved. From time to time we actually plan an outing that brings our members to a charity event such as when we did the ""Walk for MS"", or ""beach cleanup"". Part of my plan is to be able to grow the membership and have recurring community events that we can actively participate in on a regular basis. Part of our blog is dedicated to allowing members to post information about charitable events or non profits. This gives them an outlet to share with other members. My goal is to be a bigger part of the community.My success is the fact that I have planned over 200 events and brought many new friendships to life. Your contribution will allow people who are looking for more social interaction, the ability to do so more frequently without costing and arm and a leg. Plainly put, I am a people person. I work hard at fulfilling my members needs and wants and put them first before mine. I have dozens of unsolicited testimonials from members who have said such great things about how I planned and executed our events.Here are some unsolicited testimonials from real members•This was my first meet me there event with this group. Everyone was really fun and made me feel right at home. Great group.   -Scott•Had a great time. Well organized. Nice people.  -Kate•Yeaaaaaa!

<p> Dumela bo-mma le bo-rra! (That means “Hello ladies and gentlemen” in Setswana, the language spoken here in Botswana). My name is Tori, and I am an American college student studying abroad. I am part of the CIEE Arts and Sciences Program in Gaborone, Botswana. Currently, I am doing an internship at Kagisano Society Women’s Shelter. This is a shelter working to end gender-based (domestic) violence. It provides counselling among other services, as well as temporary shelter for women and children who have left abusive partners/homes. </p>
<p>My campaign is working to economically empower women who have suffered gender-based violence. The funds that we raise will go towards helping these women get job skills/training and/or education courses so they can be financially independent. </p>
<p>This is a particularly pressing issue because when women do not have means to provide for themselves financially after they leave their abusive partners, who tend to be the breadwinners, they may go back to the partners or turn to other ways to support themselves that aren't sustainable. Some even turn to such means as prostitution, putting themselves and their health at risk. With economic stability, these women will be able to provide for themselves and their children and live a fulfilling life free from gender-based violence. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>My goal is to raise $3,000 US dollars, which in Pula (the currency in Botswana) is 29,612.10 Pula. </p>
<p>The money that you donate will be transmitted directly into the Kagisano Society Women's Shelter's bank account. The money will be allocated to clients on a case by case basis, to pay for things like job training programs and business sessions. </p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our goal of raising $3,000 US dollars (or 29,612.10 Pula), the money we do raise will still go to Kagisano.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This project is important because essentially, economic independence is freedom. Women who earn their own living no longer have to go back to an abusive partner for money, which would most likely continue the cycle of violence. Furthermore, the self-confidence gained in beginning a career would help these women feel fulfilled and proud. Think about the first time you got a job; the pride and joy you felt is the same way these women can feel. Not only are they finally free from economic dependence/oppression, they are also free from abuse.</p>
<p>Donating to this campaign would allow women at the shelter to be able to pursue economic endeavors such as;</p>
<p>-attend job training courses in various fields </p>
<p>-attend courses at local technical colleges </p>
<p>-attend sessions on starting and/or maintaining a business, and then actually having the funds to start the business (typically selling items such as food, clothes, etc.)</p>
<p>-attend agricultural programs (learning to grow crops)</p>
<p>-learn to sew/tailor, and create and sell clothes</p>
<p>These are just some of the options the clients would have; the shelter needs money, however, to pay the fees for these programs and sessions. </p>
<p>I personally work with clients at the shelter every week, and I am inspired hearing about what they would like to do after they leave the shelter. These women have dreams, whether it be running a cafe or a daycare center or a clothing shop, and they refuse to let the violence in their past stop them from seeing a brighter future ahead. That is why I am asking for these donations; I would like to help them see brighter days.   </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>When donating to any project/organization, one often wonders where the money is actually going. I completely understand, because I wonder that myself. But this campaign is legitimate; the money will be going to Kagisano Society Women's Shelter. As an intern there, I know the organization well. I trust it to use the funds for the purpose of helping their shelter clients move on to a sustainable life. </p>

<p><strong>MY Story:</strong></p><p>This video is only a basic prototype set of units for testing the concepts of the transmitting and the repeat processes.

2009, Terry Tedford discovered a need for a device that can improve the
communication within motorcycle riding groups and with improved communication,
improve safety. Through a series of events that were witnessed while out on
rides, it became clear that a need exists but there is no solution. T.L.
Tedford Enterprises, Inc. has developed that solution through Motorcycle Group
Alert™. Motorcycle Group Alert™ is a patent pending touchscreen electronic device,
which once mounted on the handlebars of every bike in the group, will allow
every group member to visually receive warnings and alerts. This is superior to
any current method, but not intrusive. T.L. Tedford Enterprises, Inc. contends
that motorcyclists do not want to chat with one another, but they do want to
know when there is a pothole up ahead, and they don’t want to be left behind
when they break down unexpectedly. This is the function of Motorcycle Group
Alert™. Safety is the objective.</p>

</p><h2><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Opportunity and the Strategy</a></h2>
<p></p>

As
mentioned above, the opportunity with Motorcycle Group Alert™ is to fulfill a need
in safety that exists in the group motorcycle riding market. Since information
flows through groups, often at an incredibly quick pace, T.L. Tedford
Enterprises, Inc. will use this phenomenon to its advantage. Once the value of
the product is recognized by a few individuals in a group, the excitement will
spread to other members of the group. Additionally, many riders ride with more
than one group. This provides opportunity for cross-group seeding of the idea.
Motorcyclists love recommendations from other riders. This phenomenon will not
be difficult to propagate.

<p>Motorcyclists congregate many times each
year at or as a group at major motorcycle rallies. These present T.L. Tedford Enterprises, Inc.
an opportunity to educate bikers about the product, and demonstrate the benefits
as well. Since initial sales of Motorcycle Group Alert™ will be online via a
well-known motorcycle accessory website, the exposure will be international
immediately. Through marketing campaigns aligned with this website, and other
online presences, knowledge of the product will be disseminated. At the bike
rallies customers will have an opportunity to put their hands on the product
and run it through its paces. They will also have an opportunity to purchase
the unit at the rally. </p><p>
</p><p>Trade shows are historically a good venue for
information dissemination. T.L. Tedford Enterprises, Inc. will take advantage
of numerous opportunities to attend such shows. With good educational materials
onsite, this will provide excellent exposure of Motorcycle Group Alert™.</p>

</p><h2><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Target Market and Projections</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The
target market is all motorcyclists that participate in group rides. As of 2010
this segment made up 15 percent of the total motorcycle riding market with a
historical trend of 6.6 percent annual increase. Projecting the numbers along
the trend line provides an estimate of 1.4 million riders in our segment (9.3
million in the total motorcycle market) in 2012. With rising fuel cost and
consumers’ drive to improve their fuel economy, the trend on the total market
is expected to continue its annual increase of 6.6 percent. We find, however,
the target market will not increase at the same rate because there is no
affirmable correlation between purchasing a motorcycle for fuel efficiency and
riding in group rides. But, some new market entrants are likely to enter our
target market as they adopt their new lifestyle of riding on two wheels. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Competitive Advantages</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The
competitive advantage of Motorcycle Group Alert™ is the focus and improvement
on safety. There are many motorcycle accessories available to consumers, and
there are many accessories that claim they improve safety. However, none use an
active communication process employed by our product. This is not a
communication device for leisure communications, such as a VHF headset, or cell
phone. This is an alert device that provides user defined safety alerts to
everyone in a group. Bikers do not want to be intrusively interrupted from
their communion with the open road. They do, however, want to know when there
is trouble ahead, or a member of the group is having trouble behind. Motorcycle
Group Alert™ is not intrusive – it is safety!</p>

<p><span><b>Here's the Scoop...</b></span></p>
<p><span>""</span><span>Our popular culture reinforces the idea that </span><span>dealing with pet waste is a pain in the butt, no pun intended</span><span>. We're out to change that fallacious idea one pickup</span><span> at a time! Help us establish our</span><span> program to serve people in need</span><span> of some pet </span><span>waste assistance</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Let's face it, picking up dog waste is cumbersome. To many American's it's the worst thing about having a dog, that will all change with the development of our ""PoopSter app"" Within a few clicks</span><span> on</span><span> your Android or IOS device</span><span>, you'll be on the way to a cleaner yard for your four legged friends and family.</span></p>
<p><span><b>More about the Project</b></span></p>
<p><span>We are a veteran owned a</span><span>nd</span><span> operated business start-up in Michigan. We provide </span><span>pet</span><span> waste removal </span><span>service </span><span>currently too Macomb, </span><span>St.Clair</span><span>, Sanilac and parts of Oakland county</span><span>.</span><span>We are hoping to expand this year </span><span>with your help and launch our  PoopSter app to go N</span><span>ationwide. </span><span>For as long as the dog has been </span><span>man's</span><span> best friend, dog waste has posed a menace to man's nose and foot. Now science has revealed a more unsavory truth: </span><span>It's an environmental pollutant</span><span>.</span><span>– This fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution.</span><span>  This is where we started to envision </span><span>“</span><span>PoopSter</span><span>”</span><span> and all the possible benefits we could bring to people</span><span> and </span><span>their</span><span> pets:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span></span></p>
<p> Stormwater carries pet waste and other pollutants directly into waterways.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><p><span>Animal waste may contain harmful organisms such as Giardia, Salmonella and E. coli that can be transmitted to humans and other animals by ingesting contaminated water.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Roundworms and hookworms deposited by infected animals can live in the soil for long periods of time and be transmitted to other animals and humans.</span></p></li>
</ul>
</div><p></p><ul>
<li><p><span>It’s the law! Many urban and suburban areas require you to pick up after your pet. Even if there is no restriction, cleaning up after your pet is always the right thing to do.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>No one likes to step in pet waste and spread it into homes, cars and businesses.</span></p></li>
</ul><div>
<p></p>
<p><span>When reviewing these benefits and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a business that needs to be </span><span>re-invented</span><span>.</span><span>  This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us the leader in </span><span>our</span><span> industry. Our mission is to take care of every customer and staff member with the upmost respect and care</span><span> while providing an efficient, on demand poo pickup and removal service.</span><span>  We feel this will </span><span>differentiate us from other services in our industry. Our client's will never have to worry about cleaning up after fido again!</span></p>
<p><span><b>About Us</b></span></p>
<p><span>Our company is passionate with creating a</span><span>n</span><span> unmatched </span><span>pet</span><span> waste removal company that is customer service driven and extremely sanitary</span><span>. </span><span>Unfortunately, we have noticed</span><span> when companies design new </span><span>concepts</span><span> they contain preliminary flaws but our goal is to stay dedicated to quality because we know your </span><span>health and cleanliness</span><span> is at stake! We have engineered a unique method and user-friendly results that is second to none. Not only that, but they are more affordable so do not have to worry about it being price prohibitive. Help us make this a reality and let’s get </span><span>the poop removed</span><span> for less!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>How You Can Help</b></span></p>
<p><span>For us to bring the </span><span>“</span><span>PoopSter</span><span> app</span><span>”</span><span> to life, we need your support!</span></p>
<p><span>Your generous funding will help us get things started in order to </span><span>move us forward with </span><span>our </span><span>concept</span><span>. It will assist us with the cost </span><span>app</span><span> development, m</span><span>arketing </span><span>and production</span><span> of locations</span><span>. </span><span>  We will also use our funding to test our concept </span><span>in multi</span><span>pu</span><span>le area's this S</span><span>ummer as part of our pilot beta</span><span>. We are in the process of choosing two or three cities for our R&amp;D and test lauch.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>“</span><span>PoopSte</span><span>r</span><span> Project</span><span>”</span><span> needs pledging but above all it needs your attention and interest! If you love this </span><span>idea</span><span> as much as we do then please take a moment to click on one of our social media buttons (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube at the bottom of the page). Help us spread the word and get things started!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>How We'll Use the Funds</b></span></p>
<p><span>We need about </span><span>$65,000 </span><span>in order to </span><span>get things started. About half of this amount is going towards app development. The other half is going towards many things </span><span>includ</span><span>ing </span><span>marketing</span><span>, materials, labor and related expenses for </span><span>start-up</span><span> growth</span><span>. </span></p>
<p><b>A vision for our future</b>:</p>
<p>Hopefully we can grow and develop other ways to help out and here is something we are thinking about: <b>Being Green. </b>In our near future we would like to work with a renewable energy company and recycle the waste. Poo is a great way to create Methane. Methane can be used in many different renewable energy projects:)</p>

""Our popular culture reinforces the idea that dealing with pet waste is a pain in the butt, no pun intended. We're out to change that fallacious idea one pickup at a time! Help us establish our program to serve people in need of some pet waste assistance.
Let's face it, picking up dog waste is cumbersome. To many American's it's the worst thing about having a dog, that will all change with the development of our ""PoopSter app"" Within a few clicks on your Android or IOS device, you'll be on the way to a cleaner yard for your four legged friends and family.
More about the Project
We are a veteran owned and operated business start-up in Michigan. We provide pet waste removal service currently too Macomb, St.Clair, Sanilac and parts of Oakland county.We are hoping to expand this year with your help and launch our  PoopSter app to go Nationwide. For as long as the dog has been man's best friend, dog waste has posed a menace to man's nose and foot. Now science has revealed a more unsavory truth: It's an environmental pollutant.– This fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution.  This is where we started to envision “PoopSter” and all the possible benefits we could bring to people and their pets:



 Stormwater carries pet waste and other pollutants directly into waterways.


Animal waste may contain harmful organisms such as Giardia, Salmonella and E. coli that can be transmitted to humans and other animals by ingesting contaminated water.
Roundworms and hookworms deposited by infected animals can live in the soil for long periods of time and be transmitted to other animals and humans.


It’s the law! Many urban and suburban areas require you to pick up after your pet. Even if there is no restriction, cleaning up after your pet is always the right thing to do.
No one likes to step in pet waste and spread it into homes, cars and businesses.


When reviewing these benefits and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a business that needs to be re-invented.  This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us the leader in our industry. Our mission is to take care of every customer and staff member with the upmost respect and care while providing an efficient, on demand poo pickup and removal service.  We feel this will differentiate us from other services in our industry. Our client's will never have to worry about cleaning up after fido again!
About Us
Our company is passionate with creating an unmatched pet waste removal company that is customer service driven and extremely sanitary. Unfortunately, we have noticed when companies design new concepts they contain preliminary flaws but our goal is to stay dedicated to quality because we know your health and cleanliness is at stake! We have engineered a unique method and user-friendly results that is second to none. Not only that, but they are more affordable so do not have to worry about it being price prohibitive. Help us make this a reality and let’s get the poop removed for less!

How You Can Help
For us to bring the “PoopSter app” to life, we need your support!
Your generous funding will help us get things started in order to move us forward with our concept. It will assist us with the cost app development, marketing and production of locations.   We will also use our funding to test our concept in multipule area's this Summer as part of our pilot beta. We are in the process of choosing two or three cities for our R&D and test lauch.
The “PoopSter Project” needs pledging but above all it needs your attention and interest! If you love this idea as much as we do then please take a moment to click on one of our social media buttons (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube at the bottom of the page). Help us spread the word and get things started!

How We'll Use the Funds
We need about $65,000 in order to get things started. About half of this amount is going towards app development. The other half is going towards many things including marketing, materials, labor and related expenses for start-up growth. 
A vision for our future:
Hopefully we can grow and develop other ways to help out and here is something we are thinking about: Being Green. In our near future we would like to work with a renewable energy company and recycle the waste. Poo is a great way to create Methane. Methane can be used in many different renewable energy projects:)

Final Thank You and Links

Together with management, we planned a bar night with promotions to generate attendance and tampon/pad donations. One package of tampons or products got you free cover.

It was an aging dairy farm that had seen better days.  On the farm there is a huge hay barn. Underneath all the dirt and 100 years of dust, I could see a barn that wanted to shine again.  Thus began a journey I couldn't have imagined.  From our first Halloween party with 200 people, to friends birthday parties and eventually my daughter's wedding, the idea was born to make this a place for others in the community to enjoy too.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1419773/files/20150427135628-two_pic_barn.jpg?1430168188"" src="""" style=""""/></p>It was my daughter's wedding that triggered the ongoing 
transformation of the barn. Since that day 3 years ago, friends and friends of friends have gotten 
married in this special space. I have hosted graduation parties, farm to
 table fundraisers, school barn dances,movie shoots and many
 birthday parties, the most poignant being an 80th celebration for a man 
who grew up on the farm but hadn't been back in 60 years (See the whole story of why, in my history section below).<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1419764/files/20150427135320-tri_pic_2.jpg?1430168000"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>As a result of those events, the barns fame started to have a life of its own. People telling 
people about their experiences here. Friends kept telling me I should 
start a business because it was such a fantastic space and people loved 
it so much. At first I was hesitant, but then I saw that by doing that, 
it would create an income for me right here at home, and believe me, 
when you're a single mother and managing  120 acres and raising a 
daughter you need to be here!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1419734/files/20150427134355-two_pic_2.jpg?1430167435"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I decided to go for it! I thought 
it would be pretty easy(how naive I was), and starting talking to the 
County about what I need to do to get permitted. The more I discussed 
with them what I was trying to
 achieve the more levels and hoops I had to jump through. After 3 years 
of incredibly baffling, frustrating, and sometimes exhilarating 
(when I'd pass another level of their requirements) I now have an 
approved Conditional 
Use Permit with Whatcom County Building and Codes.  Which means I can 
now apply for my building permits.The costs have gone from a projected $35,000 which I could handle, to $70,000 at which I was gritting my teeth 
and not sleeping, but still able to do, to $120,000 which is where I need
 help!

I  wondered to myself,why am I still
 moving forward with this project? One of the main reasons is that I get 
phone calls, and people coming down my driveway looking for 'that barn 
where my friend got married' all the time. I show them the barn 
and they get all ooh and aahhh. I've never encountered anyone who 
doesn't appreciate the barn.  It seems to be one of those field of 
dreams situations….build it and they will come. From my experience our 
community really loves this old barn and our farm. I feel motivated 
knowing that.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F45224298&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F45224298&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F314402780_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1366002/files/20150408100658-how_far_header.jpg?1428512818"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We've already spent a lot of time and our own money to revive the barn,  Check out the pictures below to see some of the work that's been done.   <br/></p><div>

In order to bring the barn up to code we've had to hire a lot of professionals to make sure its all done right and satisfy the county.  We've brought in a structural engineer, architect, fire flow engineer, archeologist, critical area/wetlands specialist, fish and wildlife Dept. and the army corps of engineers,  not to mention all the contractors to do the work!  A lot of money has already been spent, we just need a little more to finish the job.

<br/><p>The remaining two big pieces to get this project done are the fire line and the sprinkler system. We've already had the engineers out here, we've got the plans drawn up, we've got bids on the work and people ready to go, we just need the money to make it happen.  </p>
<p>Once your donations have been received we will be able to move forward quickly and get the barn ready to host events.  We are so excited to see the community get behind this project and help us bring the barn up to code so it can be a space for great gatherings.</p>

It was an aging dairy farm that had seen better days. Some work had been done on the farm before I moved in but there was still a long way to go. Imagine truck loads of old farm equipment, tires, junk, out buildings that hadn't been painted in 30 years or more, over grown black berries, broken fences.….but under all that mess was this farm that wanted to shine again. Especially a big fantastic hay barn. Since we weren't going to be storing hay for 100 head of cattle, I could see what a wonderful space it would be for family and friends to play in. As soon as I got settled in my house, I started cleaning it out(manure!) and cleaning(80 years of dust and spider webs). The cleaner it got I started thinking how cool it would be to have a summer bedroom up in the loft. You know..vintage furniture against beautiful old barn boards.  I love to collect cool old treasure so I rounded up what I thought would be awesome for an exotic sleeping space.  It looks like a movie set and it's a fantastic place to sleep. You feel like you are in some kind of fairy tale!<br/><br/>
<p>Next we started having grand scale Halloween parties. The kind people talk about for days. The kind where you say 'that was the best Halloween party I've ever been to'. For our first party my friends Deb and Claudia and I made an 18ft flying goddess with the body of a mermaid and long fabrics streamers for wings. We hung her so she would fly over the party. She was a sight to behold floating over our heads. Having big parties gives you the opportunity to think up amazing things to create! The party was a big success with over 200 people attending….</p>
<p>What happened next really sealed the fate of the barn. My daughter came to me and said she wanted to get married at the farm. Of course I said, thinking how wonderful!… and also thinking oh boy, here comes another round of cleaning- like 45ft up to the top ridge line with an articulating lift and pressure washing down a 100 years of dirt kind of cleaning! That was such an intense experience because by this time I had a lot of furniture in the barn and had to keep moving it all around with tarps for 3 days so it wouldn't get wet. And wet the barn did get! Ugh!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">One day while discussing the details of how the wedding would go we started talking  about music for her  celebration. She mentioned a 9 piece funk band…hhmmm I said, thats going to require a dance floor.  Her fiancé stepped up and enlisted the help of his step father and best friend and voila, 700 sq ft of surface gravel was removed and a dance floor was born. This act triggered the ongoing transformation of the barn. Friends and friends of friends have gotten married in this special space. I have hosted graduation parties, farm to table fundraisers, </span>school barn dances,movie shoots and<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> many birthday parties,the most poignant being an 80th celebration for a man who grew up on the farm but hadn't been back in 60 years due his brothers wife who didn't like anybody, ( she was a mail order bride from Switzerland btw).

It is a wonderful place for people to relax, have fun, create beautiful memories and spend time with their families and friends. I enjoy knowing that this historic barn that holds all the special days for people will move into the future and be around for another 100 years. I hope you will consider supporting me so I can continue to support our community.

<p></p> I've given a lot of thought to the 'perk' system. I prefer thinking about as giving back. How I can I give back to you for helping me finish my vision. In thinking about this I knew I wanted to make some things with my own hands, to give back in a meaningful way. I am a former clothing designer so I knew I could create some gorgeous skirts. Check them out, I call them my sweater skirts. They are kind of a uniform of mine. A beautiful skirt and a wool sweater and boots. It's easy to make a fancy skirt more casual that way. I also made velvet pillowcases. I love sleeping on these and have for years. They can go right through the washer and dryer! Instead of ordering bulk tote bags made who knows where, I upcycled some canvas and made my own! I love photography and chose 8 images from this last year to make notecards out of. Isn't it nice to get a card in the mail? I'll also work my tail off hosting events for you! And last but not least ,I had 3 different friends offer up perks  too. An overnight in an airbnb, handmade linen totes, and an intention setting felted wool pouch making workshop. I hope something will catch eye in my offerings.

<p>In any new adventure there are always risks and challenges. As I explained above, I have already faced numerous challenges and have worked my way through them. I have no doubt  there will be more and knowing that the community is supporting my project  I will get through them as well.</p>

</div></div>","I moved to Two Sisters farm six years ago. It was an aging dairy farm that had seen better days.  On the farm there is a huge hay barn. Underneath all the dirt and 100 years of dust, I could see a barn that wanted to shine again.  Thus began a journey I couldn't have imagined.  From our first Halloween party with 200 people, to friends birthday parties and eventually my daughter's wedding, the idea was born to make this a place for others in the community to enjoy too.It was my daughter's wedding that triggered the ongoing 
transformation of the barn. Since that day 3 years ago, friends and friends of friends have gotten 
married in this special space. I have hosted graduation parties, farm to
 table fundraisers, school barn dances,movie shoots and many
 birthday parties, the most poignant being an 80th celebration for a man 
who grew up on the farm but hadn't been back in 60 years (See the whole story of why, in my history section below).As a result of those events, the barns fame started to have a life of its own. People telling 
people about their experiences here. Friends kept telling me I should 
start a business because it was such a fantastic space and people loved 
it so much. At first I was hesitant, but then I saw that by doing that, 
it would create an income for me right here at home, and believe me, 
when you're a single mother and managing  120 acres and raising a 
daughter you need to be here!I decided to go for it! I thought 
it would be pretty easy(how naive I was), and starting talking to the 
County about what I need to do to get permitted. The more I discussed 
with them what I was trying to
 achieve the more levels and hoops I had to jump through. After 3 years 
of incredibly baffling, frustrating, and sometimes exhilarating 
(when I'd pass another level of their requirements) I now have an 
approved Conditional 
Use Permit with Whatcom County Building and Codes.  Which means I can 
now apply for my building permits.The costs have gone from a projected $35,000 which I could handle, to $70,000 at which I was gritting my teeth 
and not sleeping, but still able to do, to $120,000 which is where I need
 help!

I almost bailed a few times as the costs mounted but something kept pushing me on. I  wondered to myself,why am I still
 moving forward with this project? One of the main reasons is that I get 
phone calls, and people coming down my driveway looking for 'that barn 
where my friend got married' all the time. I show them the barn 
and they get all ooh and aahhh. I've never encountered anyone who 
doesn't appreciate the barn.  It seems to be one of those field of 
dreams situations….build it and they will come. From my experience our 
community really loves this old barn and our farm. I feel motivated 
knowing that.We've already spent a lot of time and our own money to revive the barn,  Check out the pictures below to see some of the work that's been done.   







In order to bring the barn up to code we've had to hire a lot of professionals to make sure its all done right and satisfy the county.  We've brought in a structural engineer, architect, fire flow engineer, archeologist, critical area/wetlands specialist, fish and wildlife Dept. and the army corps of engineers,  not to mention all the contractors to do the work!  A lot of money has already been spent, we just need a little more to finish the job.



The remaining two big pieces to get this project done are the fire line and the sprinkler system. We've already had the engineers out here, we've got the plans drawn up, we've got bids on the work and people ready to go, we just need the money to make it happen.  
Once your donations have been received we will be able to move forward quickly and get the barn ready to host events.  We are so excited to see the community get behind this project and help us bring the barn up to code so it can be a space for great gatherings.

What We Need</b><br/>
We need your help! 
Because of recent changes in the reimbursements from insurance companies and medicaid under the Affordable Care Act , their hands are tied with very little cash flow right at a time when women need their high-touch, low-tech care even more! <br/>
Inadequate prenatal care is associated with poor birth outcomes. Recognizing
barriers to care is necessary to improve results.  In a study in
Sacramento, CA published in PubMed,  women reported the inability to find
a provider willing to accept them as the single largest barrier to obtaining
care, cited by 64% of women overall and 96% of those who tried but were unable
to obtain care. The difficulty finding any providers willing to take them
indicates that these women need the special services that Trillium Waterbirth
Center provides to ensure adequate care during pregnancy.  Making
midwifery care available to the critically low-income area of southern Oregon
and allowing women to get care in their own homes is the solution to reducing
poor birth outcomes.  Trillium serves over a hundred families every
year, we can’t loose this resource in the community!</p>

<p><b>What our Friends Have to Say:</b></p>
<p>Amy Botillier, Medford,OR</p>
<p>""Choosing the midwifery care model during my pregnancy this last year was hands down the best healthcare choice I have ever made for myself. Our nation, and sadly our state greatly undervalue the fantastic quality of care that midwives offer. It is unfortunate that we are moving backward rather than progressing, and I want to see it change.""</p>
<p>Angelina and Simon, Scott Valley, CA</p>
<p>""We can't thank you enough for all the love, kindness, and support you have shown us through my pregnancy, labor, delivery, and postpartum.  Having our children in our life is magical and with your help I was able to welcome them into this world peacefully.  Thank you for being part of our lives during this wonderful, beautiful time.""</p>
<p>Julie Villegas, Grants Pass,OR</p>
<p>""I am pregnant OHP woman who had a child by OB and by a midwife. It was as different as night and day! The midwife really assisted me through my entire pregnancy and labor, my OB literally came in right as the baby was born to congratulate me. I feel midwifery is the best for the mom and child!"" </p>
<p>Sarah DeLong, Ashland,OR</p>
<p>“OBs are surgeons and as such are trained in how to treat high risk births. They have very little experience with normal births during their internships and residencies. Midwives have to attend hundreds of births before being licensed and allowed to practice on their own. A midwife is the best and safest choice for most pregnant women.”</p>
<p>Amanda Matney, Grants Pass,OR</p>
<p>""I had my son with a midwife and it was the most amazing experience. I felt safe and cared for unlike the hospital setting with doctors that are on a time schedule. Being comfortable with them helped make my labor be stress free, thus reducing complications. People should have a choice in where they birth their babies, even if they are on OHP. ""</p>
<p>Tess Castellano, Talent,OR</p>
<p>""I'm a mother who believes in options, and the most comfortable way is having the freedom to choose how I decide to being my children into this world. I want to be able to have the ability to move and birth as I deem fit to my family. I don't want my only option to be your typical experience, on ‘your back with drugs’ birth. My husband and I sit firmly in middle class. We can't afford a lot, but we're comfortable. Midwifery has provided us with a cheaper, more natural experience and we feel no one has the right to tell us how we have to give birth, pushing us into debt for the next 10 years. It also seems to make sense saving hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly for our state budget!""</p>
<p>Shara Baack,Medford,OR</p>
<p>""Women deserve the right to choose where and how their babies are born. It is time that we stop seeing birth as a problem that has to be dealt with and see it for the natural, beautiful entry of a child into the world, and a normal beautiful process for the mother, as opposed to a issue to be dealt with.""</p>

</div></div>","WE ARE: Friends of Trillium! ARE YOU?
Trillium Waterbirth Center is struggling to make ends meet as the Oregon Health Plan continues to delay approval of healthy low-risk women. In fact Trillium midwives have delivered multiple babies in the last 2 months whose mothers still haven’t been approved despite being healthy and low risk. Help us bridge the gap between very reduced and often no reimbursement at all from OHP, so they can continue to offer the choice for holistic prenatal care to the community, regardless of income level. Help us in the fight in freedom of medical care. Freedom to birth in a more supportive and peaceful environment.

‘Friends of Trillium’ is a non-profit organization started and run by the Southern Oregon Birth Advocacy Council. SOBAC is an outreach advocacy group lead by consumers in southern Oregon and works to protect families in the childbearing year by empowering them to explore their choices for care, ensuring all choices are available for all families (regardless of income level) and striving to create bridges to integrate different care models within this community, so that safety is the top priority in any care location. Friends of Trillium are a group of mamas and papas who have utilized the services of the Trillium Waterbirth Center during their pregnancy, birth, or postpartum recovery. They are a passionatly supportive group of families who understand how valuable it is to have access to the model of care they find most comfortable and the right to choose it for themselves. They hope that this option will become part of the mainstream medical word, a normal choice that is openly and widely available to ALL women in ALL communities. That the choice be put into the hands of the people, not having our medical options dictated for us by our insurance companies or the medicaid payer system.

<p>After being diagnosed with a rare, progressive lung disease called LAM, Melanee Grondahl decided to start a mobile-coffee business called Feather Coffee that gives twenty five cents per cup of coffee to three revolving charities, one always being a rare disease organization. She eventually wants to franchise the business so more funds can be raised. All donations from this campaign will go towards purchasing the first Feather Coffee trailer.</p>
<p><b>What Problem Can You Help Feather Coffee Solve?-</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Melanee is one amongst an estimated 300 million people worldwide who are affected by a rare disease. The rare disease community relies on grassroots fundraising efforts. However, without a foundation to represent a disease or a large pool of people with the disease who are raising funds, finding a cure is almost impossible. An annual race or golf tournament isn't enough. A clinical drug trial can cost more than $100 million. According Forbes, the </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">average drug developed for the market by a major pharmaceutical company costs at least $4 billion. The </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Kakkis EveryLife Foundation reports that </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">95% of rare diseases have not one single FDA approved drug treatment. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The rare disease community desperately needs a large-scale, consistent way to raise money.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is the Cause Brewing Model?</b>-Feather Coffee might start small, but the cause-brewing model has the potential to grow into a large-scale business that can raise big funds. What is the Cause-Brewing Model? The cause-brewing model is simple, and it is all about giving back.</p>

<p>Twenty-five cents per cup of coffee is donated to three revolving charities. One of these charities is always a rare disease organization. Feather Coffee’s products also support a cause. For example, we've chosen to brew Three Avocados Coffee, a non-profit that gives 100% of its proceeds to water projects in Uganda and education projects in Nicaragua.<br/></p>
<p><b>What Impact Can Your Donation Make?</b> All donations from this campaign will go towards purchasing the first Feather Coffee trailer. We will then use the trailer to further develop and hone the cause-brewing business model. With the crowd-funding success and proof of a profitable business, we will seek investors and franchise the business.</p>

Fifty-five percent of consumers worldwide say that when quality and price are equal, the most important factor influencing brand choice is purpose. Feather Coffee's cause-brewing model is an example of what today's consumers are asking for. Consumers already spend billions of dollars on specialty coffee, but they would be more likely to spend those dollars on a cup of Feather Coffee because it has a purpose.  Every cup of our coffee contains not just one but multiple ways a person can give back.</span></p>

<div>The Feather Coffee team is strong. We consist of experts in communication, marketing, film, design, and fundraising.

<div>There is a saying: ""When you want to succeed as much as you want to breathe, then you will be successful."" For Melanee and the Feather Coffee team, this couldn't be truer.

<p>The Highline Bears Baseball Organization is a new expansion
team in the Pacific International League. The Pacific International League
(PIL) was founded in 1992, the league is considered by many to be the premier
Summer Collegiate Baseball league in the Northwest. Sanctioned by the National
Baseball Congress (NBC), most PIL players are NCAA eligible and are unpaid in
order to maintain their eligibility. The PIL is different from many other
summer collegiate baseball leagues in that the league also allows former
professionals and college graduates to participate.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>In the 1950's, 60's and 70's White Center Stadium (now
Steve Cox Memorial Park) was the home of men's semi-professional baseball and
professional fast pitch softball teams. Several hundred adults, kids and
families would fill the stands and sit along the side fences watching a high
level of baseball under the lights on Friday and Saturday nights. The stadium
hosted former professional baseball players, college athletes with dreams of
making it to the big's and men's fast pitch teams like Pay n' Pak and the King
&amp; His Court.</p>
<p>After the original wood stadium burnt down in the late
1970's baseball slowly faded from the Highline area. Today the park has been
remodeled, dedicated to fallen community leader &amp; police officer Steve Cox
and is home to little leaguers, high school &amp; men's senior leagues but the
stand are far from full. The once packed, community centered stadium rarely
sees a high level of competitive baseball. The stands of the stadium can still
hold over a thousand spectators but haven't seen that type of crowds in
decades. The Highline Bears hope to bring a high level of baseball back to the
Highline &amp; White Center area.</p>
<p>All contributions made through our IndieGoGo campaign will help fund the teams expenses. We are a sponsorship and donation based organization and we need you help. All contributions will be used for; field rentals, umpire fees, tournament fees, player uniforms, baseball equipment and travel expenses.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Highline Bears have a budget of $50,000 that we need to fill by the middle of May. Most other teams that run like ours will run on a budget of $80,000-$150,000. We have limited our travel trips and expenses by having staff members volunteer their time during our first season. Our plan to fill this budget is by attracting local small businesses to sponsor, doing multiple small fund raisers and using our IndieGoGo campaign where we hope to raise at least $20,000.</p>
<p><b>Perks Of Contributing:</b></p>
<p>We offer a lot of different perks we offer in return for you contribution to our organization. They include:</p>
<p>-A Personalized Thank You Tweet</p>

<p>-Personalized Thank You Team Photo</p>
<p>-Team T-shirts</p>

<p>-Being an Honorary Coach</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have a lot of challenges we have already over come. Being a new team and launching our team as late as December this has been a huge project. </p>
<p>We first had to find players to fill our roster. Most summer teams start recruiting their players in September and have their roster filled by December.

<p>Our next challenge was getting access to the stadium, which is managed by our local county parks department.

<div>Yes advertisements, like you might know most websites serve ads to keep an income to keep the systems running. So yes also we are gonna be serving ads.

Also every ad gets checked by a moderator if it's not too flashy (everyone hates those pesky flashy ads) and get checked if they are SFW or not. (NSFW ads can be enabled in your settings.)</div>

Short Summary

Furify is our take on a `social` network for furries. We love the ideas and sites that are already out there, but they're focused on one aspect. Let that be art, events, streaming or interaction with fellow furs. What we would love to see is one intuitive platform that provides all of these features!


Why
 So we from Furify are tired of using different kinds of media that are either not very furry-friendly or user-friendly. Example: I want to create a public event for furries? How do I easily do that? Personally I haven't found a great alternative. You either have to create a separate `furry account` on social media that actually prohibits you to do so. Or you have to put it up to 16 forums and maintain all of them.
Or another example: That time that I wanna upload a piece of art I commissioned, my experience with this is horrible. I believe that this should be intuitive and straightforward, but with most art focused websites it can even be quite difficult to do.   
What We Need   More developers: Web, iOS, Android and Windows Phone. More server hardware as popularity increases. You!... Yes what are we without you? We need your input and ideas to make Furify even greater!    


What You Get

A smooth and intuitive website.
Performance that is more like today's standards.
A more social experience. Find your friends with ease, no more guessing usernames.
Keep up to date with statuses and updates from your friends and favourite artists.
App: what is a network without an app? Nothing so we're providing one of course with all the functionalities you would expect!
Auctions: easily create an auction for your YCH, Fursuit or other art/craft piece. Simple, intuitive and manageable.
Events: simple but yet extensive event management for all your public and private events.
Art: your art is of course much more important than your regular selfies, so it deserves its own place with different privacy options. Because maybe you do want your art to be publicly visible and your photos just for your friends.
Art Theft Protection: a lot of furries struggle with art theft everyday, we wanna try to help out as much as we can by analyzing every image that gets uploaded and give the original owner the options to block or receive an notification on a re-upload.
Privacy: we don't want your private information so we don't ask for it. No firstname or lastname just your nickname so your friends can find you.
Security: also we love security so we provide multiple options for Two-Factor-Authentication (OTP, email verification code or approve authentication through the app) and provide you with an advanced session-management. And we also hate eavesdropping so we only use strong encryption ciphers.
Openness we want to keep you informed on what we are doing, and provide pages that shows the statuses of ours servers and services.
A platform that is designed to grow, we can extend, add and upgrade servers without any downtime.
   
Risks & Challenges Of course starting a new thing never comes without any risks, because without a user base a community is nothing. Our challenge is to provide you with the tools to create and sustain a great community!
    
Other Ways You Can Help Even if you haven't any spare money that doesn't mean you can't help! You can help us get our words out there. A like, share, retweet and/or follow can also be of great help!

<p>Our goal is to help communities affected by Ebola in Sierra Leone by implementing a program that trains community members to innovatively use resources they have on hand . We will begin in Kenema, a providence outside the capital of Freetown, and one of the worst-hit areas of the country. </p>
<p>In order to successfully implement our project, we have been collaborating with Shed Jah, the head of <a href=""http://www.wwoofsl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WWOOF Sierra Leone</a> and <a href=""http://www.villageearth.org/global-affiliates/village-care-initiatives-sierra-leone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Village Care Initiatives</a>, who has performed similar ventures in the country.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Where does the money go?</h3> <p>All of the money raised by this campaign will go directly towards the project.

<li>Bushels of rice: 10,000 leones each, or $2</li>

The rest will be used to carry out the project once in country. </div>
<div>We believe that campaigns like this should have a lasting impact not just on their communities but also on the donors. Therefore, all of our perks are centered around engaging you, the donors, after the campaign is over. We are offering perks including email and video updates. For the highest level donors, we will put your name on our to-be-designed website on the donor page. </div> </div> <div> <h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>For those directly affected by Ebola, whether from experiencing the disease in their communities or from losing a loved one, this is a very difficult time. Having a steady source of income that comes from a project implemented by their community, for their community, will take a large weight off their shoulders. Because our project is entirely rooted in the ideas and resources of the community, it will be self-sustaining and long-term. Our goal is to ensure that communities do not need to rely on outside assistance and have the ability to improve their own situations. </p>

been a registered charity in Swaziland since 2006. Working alongside our
volunteer travel projects our mission is to improve the quality of life of
people in need through education and skill development. Swaziland is a unique
landlocked culturally vibrant nation, though suffers from the highest HIV
prevalence in the world, and extremely high statistics of gender-based violence. This harsh reality leaves
thousands of orphaned and vulnerable children &amp; families to fight for the opportunity to attend school, and improve their quality of life. Our
programs are holistic in helping communities by helping children grow up in a child friendly caring environment. This is attained through our child sponsorship  and education program, our
play and sport development initiatives, and our Build-A-Future program.<br/></p>
<p>Our Build-A-Future program
is the foundation for our programs to help break the cycle of poverty in our communities, and disease ridden nation. Working primarily out of six Neighbourhood Care
Points; a place where pre-school aged children have the opportunity to attend
informal schooling, receive a meal, and be given the opportunity to play
and be given care from our voluntary community teachers. <br/></p><p>Our NCP structures
are the building block for creating a holistic safe community care point. It
also here through our NCP’s that our 300 sponsored children know where to find
continued support outside of the classroom.<br/></p>
<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>Our Build-A-Future Campaign
is currently seeking funds to help improve the infrastructure of our NCP’s and
our sponsored children’s homes. Building classrooms, storerooms,
kitchens, toilets and playgrounds, as well as cultivating gardens are just a
few of our main priorities. Our NCP’s are designed to be safe spaces for our children thus we
need to continue to make them an inviting home for those that don’t receive the
care every child deserves at home. </p>
<p>The campaign was started out of need to continue to develop our NCP’s. Nearly 40-60
children are fostered at each NCP on a daily basis thus having welcoming classrooms, clean and safe play
structures, hygienic toilets, community kitchens and the capacity to cultivate
gardens and have clean drinking water, relies heavily on funds raised through
donations. The implementation of these structures is carried out with our local
builder, voluntary community members, and international volunteers. As our
slogan suggests, “We build for the community, with the community, at the
community level.” Thus our actual building tools and techniques don’t use fancy
machinery, rather labor intensive local building methods. We have countless voluntary community members to help build the infrastructure, it is only a matter of having the funds to purchase the material.<br/></p>
<p><b>Build-A-Future Campaign</b></p>
<p>Our current campaign is
aiming to raise $10,000. A classroom for example costs $500; to cultivate six
gardens with enough water for maintenance it will cost $3,000. Furthermore,
constructing kitchens, storerooms (to store music and sports equipment, books
and tools), and playgrounds per NCP will quickly tally to $1000 per NCP. While
the amount being raised will contribute to only building material, plumbing and
water tanks, our Foundation will continue to source other means to employ our staff,
and contribute to vehicle hire and so on. If we don’t raise $10,000 the
accumulated funds will still benefit our NCP’s and communities, as we
will prioritize the needs of each NCP.</p>
<p>The All Out Africa
Foundation prides itself in being highly transparent which can be attested to
the invaluable support past volunteers and donors have given. In the last year,
nearly 90% of our Build-A-Future program was sustained through direct donations
to the Foundation. </p>
<p>If you are currently not
able to help financially, you can always contribute by following us through
social media, save for a volunteer experience or share our Foundation
initiatives with your family and friends through the accessible tools available
on Indiegogo. </p>

<p>In April of 2011 Teresa Coles formed a group of hiking photographers who spend time hiking together and shooting photographs around Southern California. She began to post some of her photos to her Facebook page each week. She received emails from people she knew who were in treatments for various illnesses saying that they enjoyed seeing the photos as this was their only chance to see the outdoors due to the effects of the treatments. Teresa realized that not only the patients but their care givers as well could benefit from being able to experience nature through viewing photographs.</p>
<p>Teresa created Shutterheart Stories as a collaborative effort of volunteer photographers to provide a way for patients, family members and caregivers to experience nature in times when they are unable to be outside. We create and provide photo story books made available on our website for patients and their care givers to access during times of treatment or recovery for encouragement and to reduce stress or feelings of isolation.</p>

<p>Stamped STL is a new and exciting company created to help you explore St. Louis. We started Stamped STL because of our passion for all things St. Louis. The irony is that neither of the owners were raised within the city limits. However, they both quickly fell in love with the city's charm. Through their own unique experiences, Jonathan and Katharine have discovered that the unique character of each burrow that keeps St. Louis alive throughout each season and brings the city various forms of color and character. Whether you grew up in New York City or Small Town, USA, St. Louis has a home for you, and Stamped STL wants to help you find your own favorites.</p>
<p>We are currently working to develop a series of publications and blog posts which are designed to help you discover some of the City's greatest treasures. The publications will motivate you to explore St. Louis through the use of monetary savings. Each location that we suggest has generously offered to give the owner of the Stamped STL publication a discount. Furthermore, each business that we highlight or suggest is locally owned. We love St. Louis, and we want to help foster awareness for revitalization of the local St. Louis economy and the preservation of its distinctive urban communities.

Originally, he grew up in a small town just south of the MetroEast. </p>
<p>His two fondest childhood memories involve listening to the Cardinals on the radio while sitting on the porch with his father and the bet that was made with his parents during the half time show of SuperBowl XXXIV (Rams vs Titans). If the Rams pulled off the win, they would all immediately roll down the snow covered hill in the backyard in their PJs.</p>
<p>His parents, a coal miner and a beautician, stressed the importance of education, drive, and hard work. These are the attributes that he brings to Stamped STL. Beyond that he also brings a passion for Saint Louis and the organizations, people, and events that make it a great place to live.

<h3>The Rogue Story</h3> <p>Rogue Remedies is a little company that I started at the end of 2015 to provide  100% natural and non-toxic solutions to everyday challenges  that can affect your quality of life, like difficulty in getting to sleep ....or bugs (we have not gotten to bed bugs yet - but it's on our list).</p>

<p>Rogue Remedies believes there can be solutions that are toxin-free, and are sustainable.    If the solution comes in a nice package - all the better.   Your bug spray should be something that compliments your daily life.</p>
<br/>
<h3>The Tick Mix</h3>
<div> In the Eastern Townships of Quebec Canada, we are seeing more and more ticks.  Because of global warming - they are now surviving our winters and they are carrying Lyme disease.  This is a big worry because Lyme disease is not easy to detect and often misdiagnosed. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our doctors and hospitals have not been quick to diagnose or treat for Lyme disease or the potential of it and so the only good solution was to find a way to keep the ticks from biting (because who wants to stay indoors when you're in the country).   I wanted to find a solution that was  100% natural and toxin free so one can use it everyday and feel good about themselves and the environment.... and thus the The Tick Mix was born. </div>

</h3> </div> <div> <h3>Why donate?</h3> <p>You've probably noticed that humanity has strayed pretty far up poop creek without a paddle. Wars rage. Greed abounds. The Earth moans. Manuscript Across America is my effort to at least get a paddle back in our hands and start rowing back towards the clean rivers from whence we came. But I can't do it alone. In fact, the entire premise of the project is collaboration: <i>working together to brainstorm for better</i>. While traveling across the country will no doubt be an enriching experience for me personally, it will also present a wide range of challenges - both anticipated and unforeseen. First and foremost, the journey of more than 10,000 driving miles will cost money. Food, gas and occasional accommodations (we'll sleep in my van whenever possible!) will be the biggest expenses. Funding the filming, editing and production of the documentary will also come at a significant cost. Finally, incidentals like van maintenance and event admission fees will also be a part of the budget. When you donate $100 or more, you're guaranteed to receive a DVD copy of the official Manuscript Across America documentary <i>and  </i>the satisfaction of knowing that you helped give America a good, healthy kick in the butt - in the right direction of course.   </p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Spread the Word</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">Thank you! Your contributions and support are the driving force behind Manuscript Across America. I believe that there is hope for humanity, but I also know that if we don't all take a close look at our relationships with each other and the planet, our future is bleak.

Manuscript Across America will bring together the wisdom from a full spectrum of backgrounds, enabling us to examine the essence of who we are at a specific point in time and begin taking steps towards more harmonious tomorrows.  
   Why donate? You've probably noticed that humanity has strayed pretty far up poop creek without a paddle. Wars rage. Greed abounds. The Earth moans. Manuscript Across America is my effort to at least get a paddle back in our hands and start rowing back towards the clean rivers from whence we came. But I can't do it alone. In fact, the entire premise of the project is collaboration: working together to brainstorm for better. While traveling across the country will no doubt be an enriching experience for me personally, it will also present a wide range of challenges - both anticipated and unforeseen. First and foremost, the journey of more than 10,000 driving miles will cost money. Food, gas and occasional accommodations (we'll sleep in my van whenever possible!) will be the biggest expenses. Funding the filming, editing and production of the documentary will also come at a significant cost. Finally, incidentals like van maintenance and event admission fees will also be a part of the budget. When you donate $100 or more, you're guaranteed to receive a DVD copy of the official Manuscript Across America documentary and  the satisfaction of knowing that you helped give America a good, healthy kick in the butt - in the right direction of course.      Spread the Word
Thank you! Your contributions and support are the driving force behind Manuscript Across America. I believe that there is hope for humanity, but I also know that if we don't all take a close look at our relationships with each other and the planet, our future is bleak. If you are unable to make a financial donation, you can still be of great assistance by spreading the word. Tell your friends and family about Manuscript Across America and help promote the project by using the Indiegogo share tools and social media.

<p style=""line-height: 19.5pt;"">My name is Sven Henrik Häseker
and this project is my response to the need for a multipurpose ICT and Social
Networking platform to assist with the biggest refugee crisis seen in Europe
and surrounding countries since the end of World War II.  In putting together
this project I have combined extensive business client support and project
management experience with the twin personal experiences of a migrant
background and extensive engagement on integration policy issues. When last
year the ""refugee crisis"" struck Europe, I got in touch with friends,
colleagues and partner companies and we thought hard about how we could
help. We developed a concept for a collaborative social media community to
bring together the needs of refugees, volunteers, agencies and administrative
authorities in working together to cope with the situation. So far we have
invested around $70,000 in the project, e.g. for developing a messaging app for
refugees and volunteers to communicate with each other. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 19.5pt;background-color: initial;"">In between we worked with five

European Border Regions (AEBR)</b> – the oldest NGO in the area of

our proposal, highlighting the benefits it can bring to all stakeholders who
are currently struggling to respond to the needs of Refugees. </p>
<p style=""line-height: 19.5pt;"">The Platform we want to build
will allow for easier co-ordination of efforts between different players on the
ground across Europe, and it will make it possible to address the social
isolation experienced by so many refugees, particularly those in reception
accommodation, as a result of little or no contact with the local
community.  This platform will allow for civil society in any area to link
with and support refugees locally. It is our contribution to providing a means
to respond more quickly and more effectively to the needs of Refugees, avoiding
long delays.  A few months is a long time in the life of a young child,
and a long time in the life of adults and children who need shelter, stability,
access to basic healthcare, support for recovery from trauma and a chance to
get on with rebuilding their lives. This is our offering.  Will you join

<p>Fabrika will be the first coworking space in the city of Sombor, Serbia. We are raising funds to open it. Our founder team is Serge Bajic, an MBA graduate &amp; ecommerce consultant, and Tanja, a graduate of Dutch language and literature. </p><p>The 105sqm (1130sqf) space is located in the centre of Sombor, a 700 year old city in northern Serbia. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">It was
started by two local nomads, Serge and Tanja. Their resolve came from the love for their city, its
heritage, culture, and desire to reestablish it as a regional center for
innovation, creativity and social progress. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is a social enterprise which will invest all its profits in local teams delivering projects of great social value - from music festivals to human rights</span></p>

<p><br/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Why?</b></span></p>
<p>Apart from the obvious need for a coworking space, Serge and Tanja are strongly driven to see Sombor thrive and prosper. Our city was once a regional center of culture, art, and independent thought. But as the industrial market shifted to technology and services, economy of the Balkan region suffered, and a lot of people moved out of Sombor, looking for fortunes in bigger cities. This trend needs to be stopped. With recent emergence of location independent lifestyle, we recognized that we have an opportunity to steer the city back on track, by providing services and infrastructure for digital nomads. Our members will be making impact by simply working from Fabrika.</p>

</table></div>","It's laid back, affordable, it's good food and good people. Here goes the story.Fabrika Coworking SpaceWhat?
Fabrika will be the first coworking space in the city of Sombor, Serbia. We are raising funds to open it. Our founder team is Serge Bajic, an MBA graduate & ecommerce consultant, and Tanja, a graduate of Dutch language and literature. The 105sqm (1130sqf) space is located in the centre of Sombor, a 700 year old city in northern Serbia. It was
started by two local nomads, Serge and Tanja. Their resolve came from the love for their city, its
heritage, culture, and desire to reestablish it as a regional center for
innovation, creativity and social progress. It is a social enterprise which will invest all its profits in local teams delivering projects of great social value - from music festivals to human rights
""From the first time I heard about this project, I was excited.  It had all the right elements: a strong social slant to the business; a cool team behind it and an unwavering commitment by the team to build the project up one community member at a time!  I know first hand the transformative power an innovation space can have on a small creative town and am really excited to see it be.""- Steve Munroe, Hubud, Contributed $100
Why?
Apart from the obvious need for a coworking space, Serge and Tanja are strongly driven to see Sombor thrive and prosper. Our city was once a regional center of culture, art, and independent thought. But as the industrial market shifted to technology and services, economy of the Balkan region suffered, and a lot of people moved out of Sombor, looking for fortunes in bigger cities. This trend needs to be stopped. With recent emergence of location independent lifestyle, we recognized that we have an opportunity to steer the city back on track, by providing services and infrastructure for digital nomads. Our members will be making impact by simply working from Fabrika.
""My favorite thing about the coworking movement is that it's happening all over the world in so many different ways. It just speaks to the fact that no matter what language, culture or ethnicity, there is a human instinct to share space and ideas; and a growing desire to do so. The ability to contribute and participate in a community is what makes us better dreamers, thinkers and doers."" - Mike LaRosa, Coworkoholic, Contributed $250""What I love about Fabrika is that it’s all about bringing the community together and celebrating the town they are proud to be part of - and coworking spaces are a perfect platform for that. I look forward to seeing Sombor thrive through this initiative, supported by a great team with business sustainability and the heart of community in mind.""- Stephanie Arrowsmith, Vennture, Contributed $100

Wait, where again is it… ?Most of you will think that Sombor, Serbia is in Russia. Sorry to disappoint. It’s this whole other place, roughly between Greece and Hungary. Vienna, Austria, is 5 hours away by car, and you can reach Budapest in just under 3. The city is a home to 50,000 people, a sits next to Danube river, on the tristate border of Serbia, Hungary, and Croatia.Photo by Ispánovics JózsefWho can I expect to meet there?
We are just bootstrapping our community, but from what it seems, you will be working among freelance designers, developers, journalists and architects. So, you probably shouldn’t expect to find funding for your next startup project here, but you should expect skill building events and workshops across various interesting disciplines. Not to mention you will get to interact with local teams doing projects that are shaking up this sleepy town and turning it upside down – they will be using the same coworking space as you!Ok, so, IF I decide to come live and work in Sombor, how would that look like?First things first – getting shit doneISP contract packages in Sombor start at 30Mbps and go up to 150Mbps. All decent cafes and restaurants offer stable WiFi, but if you find yourself needing more, Sombor is covered by HSPA+ (3G) mobile signal, and 1GB of data costs $4 with one of the local operators.When I’m in town, I do my work at a local bar with very comfy sofas (lap-top). Apart from that, there are few other couch-style bars, and a number of standard cafes with chairs and desks.Cafe De Sol, canal-side property popular during warm part of the yearCommunity and vibeSitting on a border of Serbia, Hungary and Croatia, and historically being a part of four kingdoms and two republics, diversity is a part of Sombor’s DNA.

Our experience in the Balkans will forever serves as a counterpoint to the modern city culture of achievement and competitiveness."" - Charine Tan, SingaporeComing to Sombor, you will become a part of community that doesn’t want to spend their days chasing riches, but enjoys simple pleasures of life instead. Intrigued by foreigners, Somborians will quickly draw you into their lifestyle of coffees all day, late evening hangouts, and obligatory breakaways to nearby weekend settlements for all day beer and bbq.
Cost of livingThere’s no other way to say it- Sombor is shamelessly cheap. Self-catering 1-bedroom apartment in city center will cost you USD 250 a month, and if you prefer shorter stay, AirBnB listings average at $35 for one night, with longer stay discounts available.

The country is now on its path to joining EU and is in debt and ruled by IMF like all other proper democracies out there. UK government says that “most visits to Serbia are trouble-free”, and Numbeo Safety Index says Serbia is roughly as safe as Australia and Sweden.

Daily activities & infrastructure
This is where things get really fun. Despite being a laid-back place, Sombor’s got you covered on your daily chores. Supermarkets are abundant with local and imported goods, daily farmer’s market will fill your need for groceries, and bicycle is the most popular method of getting around. If it starts to rain – a metered taxi will get you to the edge of the city and back for as little as $3. For the sportsy ones out there, there’s a total of three gyms in the city, more than 10 tennis fields and countless street basketball courts. You can decide to do your morning jogging on the city’s own racetrack, or simply stretch at the local yoga studio. Need someone to clean up the place while you’re out? Maids start at $2 an hour.
Unique things to do
Given its unique geo-political location, Sombor area developed its own culture and traditions. We’re talking folklore dances, traditional handcrafts, canal fishing, farm dining and accommodation, local cuisine workshops, biking tours, eating smoked trout on a canalside restaurant while enjoying local lute players. All the stuff is there, it’s what you make of it.

As for weather, Serbia has continental climate, which means four distinct seasons. Things start to blossom in early March, and April and May are buzzing with life. Starting in June, temperatures go above 30 degs, and stay like that until mid September, when Autumn creeps in, in all its golden glory. November is when Serbia’s own digital nomads start migrating to Asia, apart those few fond of rain and cold winds. December usually brings the first snow, which marks the beginning of winter.

Don’t worry, we got you covered. As fellow travellers, we understand what it means to find yourself in a new, exotic place where you can’t tell heads or tails. Whatever you need, be that help with finding a cheap place to stay, a dentist, a new pair of socks, or just someone to talk to after a busy day, we’re here for you. And that's a promise.

</div></div>","-The Future of Honey is Here-


If you're here
that means you probably love honey, same as we do. However putting honey in your drinks could get very messy, or even annoying sometimes. That's
why most people use other sweeteners for their
drinks, rather than honey. Our goal is to
make honey more convienent for the everyday use, that's
the main reason we invented Globee. 





What is Globee?
Globee is the world's first artisan honey sphere, coated with a thin gelatin layer, created to sweeten
your drinks, and also to make life a little easier.
Our Mission
Did you ever get sticky, and everything messy around you after using honey to sweeten your drinks? We know how frustrating this can be, that's why our team reimagined the honey sweetener experience.
We are raising
50,000$ to bring Globee to life. We think it's an awesome, innovative product,
and we stand behind it 100%! Your
support will allow us to initiate tooling, and manufacturing, so we can make
Globee available to you!




This unique
design was inspired by nature, we have spent several months to create the
finest holding case for our honey spheres and we got it... It looks just like a
honeycomb structure!
Worker bees seal their comb cells for protecting
honey with wax, to prevent absorption of moisture from the air.
We are using the same principle, but with different
materials.
In order to ensure the quality of the nineteen honey spheres, we
cover their capsules with a golden alu foil. That way to protect them from harmful external effects
like; light, sunray, air, and humidity.


Why use Globee? 
No more stickiness.Quick to use.Rich honey taste.Healthier than other sweeteners.
Each capsule is also easy to separate.
It's ideal for every home kitchen, or if you're on the go, just grab a few capsules and take them with you!

Globee Fits Into Your Coffee Capsule Holders!

<p>It
started with an idea. Wouldn't it be cool to start something that mattered?  The
idea we have been working on is a Tie of the Month Club.  After lots of research
and a couple trips abroad we have come up with a great plan and hope you will
agree. </p>
<p>Instead
of sourcing the ties from established manufacturers overseas, we decided to do
something different.  In January we started our own facility in Bacolod, Philippines.  We hired over 20 employees with experience levels from beginners to previous shop owners.  We then brought in trainers to teach them how to produce the highest quality ties possible. </p>
<p><b>Our Model</b></p>
<p>In
keeping with our goal of starting something that matters we decided to go with
a model that could accomplish just that.  Similar to many other successful
startups that came before us we wanted to be socially responsible. </p>
<p>The first thing we do is use 10% of all revenue(not just profit) for local health and education projects in the community where we manufacture our ties.  In addition we will donate 20% of revenue to different chartiteable organizations.  For the Indiegogo campaign, backers
will be able to choose from a list of causes they want the contribution from
their purchase to go towards.</p>
<p>Another
focus is our TFC family. We strive to create a productive and fun atmosphere at
our facility. Many of our workers even help with our events we host for
local children. At the time of our campaign we have provided over 1700
meals for local children in need.</p>
<p>In
order to lessen our environmental impact, we source local recycled materials for our packaging.</p>
<p><b>Our Product</b></p>
<p>We
think we have created a very unique product. Each tie is hand made and signed
on the back by the skillful seamstress who made it. Also included will be a set of color coordinated cuff links and matching handkerchief. All of this
for only $25 for one time purchases or $20 per month for Tie of the Month Club members.  You can presently review our website <a href=""http://www.tiesforchange.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tiesforchange.com</a> to see many of our current prototypes.

<p><b>The Harvey Prince Story</b></p> <p></p>
<p>Harvey Prince was founded in 2007 on the desire to revolutionize the beauty industry by creating high quality, eco-conscious fragrances and body products that are completely cruelty free, vegan, and safe to use for pregnant mamas—all while leaving your wallets full!</p>
<p><i>It Began With a Rebellious Idea:</i></p>
<p>Harvey Prince was founded by two brothers who sought to create the perfect perfume as a Mother’s Day gift for their inspirational mother. In doing so, they realized something incredible: boutique-quality scents should not be overpriced, intimidating, and filled with toxic chemicals. The brothers crafted a fragrance that captured her effortless beauty and radiant aura. The result: <a href=""https://www.harveyprince.com/product/ageless-1-7-oz-edt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ageless</a>, the first of our signature fragrances to disrupt the industry’s usual cosmetics-counter fare.</p>
<p>In 2015, Harvey Prince was reborn as Harvey Prince Organics, recommitted to creating the best cruelty free, vegan, and gluten free fragrances and body products.  We currently sell nearly 30 different fragrances in our online store and are continually expanding our bath, hair, and body lines, with our latest Keravegan Hair Masque and Original Fango Mud Therapy.</p>
<p>By bringing honest, pure products directly to you on our website and eliminating overpriced middlemen such as department stores and duty free shops with huge markups, we obtain the best essential oils and finest natural ingredients from all over the world, providing superior quality luxury products to our customers at a fraction of the price. We proudly design and craft all of our products in the U.S.A.</p> </div> <div> <h3>
</h3>
<p><b>FAQs</b></p> <p> </p>
<p><i>Where will The Story of Perfume ship?</i></p>
<p>We ship our subscription boxes all around the world.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>What will be in each month’s box?</i></p>
<p>Each box contains two private blend mini roller fragrances exclusive to subscribers of The Story of Perfume. In addition to these mini rollers, The Story of Perfume also contains two samples of our most popular perfumes for women, as well as two samples from our best-selling line of bath, body and hair products.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>How much does The Story of Perfume cost?</i></p>
<p>The Story of Perfume is $22 per month when you purchase a one-, three-, or six- month subscription. When you purchase a year-long subscription at $220, it’s the equivalent of getting 2 months of boxes free! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>What is the total value of the products in The Story of Perfume?</i></p>
<p>With two exclusive 7ml mini roller fragrances valued at $30 each, plus two 15-30ml samples from our best-selling bath, hair and body line, AND two 2ml samples of our most popular perfumes for women, each box contains approximately $70 worth of products for only $22 monthly!   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Is there any cost to sign up?</i></p>
<p>No! There is no cost to sign up, and users can order one month at a time instead of opting in for a longer subscription. That way, you can stop receiving The Story of Perfume boxes whenever you’d like, so there’s no obligation!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>How is The Story of Perfume different from other subscription boxes?</i></p>
<p>Unlike many other subscription beauty boxes, our products are 100% cruelty free, vegan and gluten free. Every Harvey Prince product is made in the USA with the finest natural ingredients and best essential oils. We also offer higher valued products in our boxes, since each month’s box contains two full-sized mini roller fragrances. </p> </div> <div> <h3>
</h3>
<p><b>Risks/Challenges</b></p> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Wearing perfume is perhaps one of the most intimate and personal products a woman will apply on her body. A customer may wonder to herself, how can I be sure I’ll like a fragrance if I’ve never smelled it before? </p>
<p>Whether you consider yourself a perfumista or a novice to the fragrance world, each Story of Perfume box allows you to try at a minimum four different fragrances every month: two private blend, generously sized mini rollers and two samples of our most popular perfumes. All categories of perfume notes are typically covered in each Harvey Prince fragrance for complete olfactory bliss! From citrus to florals, gourmand to wood notes, and many, many more, you’re virtually guaranteed to find a Harvey Prince fragrance that strikes your fancy and becomes your signature scent with The Story of Perfume box. The Story of Perfume box not only gives you diverse luxury fragrance options each month, it also is more affordable and less risky than buying a single perfume from a mass retailer online without having smelled it first! </p><p>

Harvey Prince was founded in 2007 on the desire to revolutionize the beauty industry by creating high quality, eco-conscious fragrances and body products that are completely cruelty free, vegan, and safe to use for pregnant mamas—all while leaving your wallets full!
It Began With a Rebellious Idea:
Harvey Prince was founded by two brothers who sought to create the perfect perfume as a Mother’s Day gift for their inspirational mother. In doing so, they realized something incredible: boutique-quality scents should not be overpriced, intimidating, and filled with toxic chemicals. The brothers crafted a fragrance that captured her effortless beauty and radiant aura. The result: Ageless, the first of our signature fragrances to disrupt the industry’s usual cosmetics-counter fare.
In 2015, Harvey Prince was reborn as Harvey Prince Organics, recommitted to creating the best cruelty free, vegan, and gluten free fragrances and body products.  We currently sell nearly 30 different fragrances in our online store and are continually expanding our bath, hair, and body lines, with our latest Keravegan Hair Masque and Original Fango Mud Therapy.
By bringing honest, pure products directly to you on our website and eliminating overpriced middlemen such as department stores and duty free shops with huge markups, we obtain the best essential oils and finest natural ingredients from all over the world, providing superior quality luxury products to our customers at a fraction of the price. We proudly design and craft all of our products in the U.S.A.   

FAQs  
Where will The Story of Perfume ship?
We ship our subscription boxes all around the world.


What will be in each month’s box?
Each box contains two private blend mini roller fragrances exclusive to subscribers of The Story of Perfume. In addition to these mini rollers, The Story of Perfume also contains two samples of our most popular perfumes for women, as well as two samples from our best-selling line of bath, body and hair products.


How much does The Story of Perfume cost?
The Story of Perfume is $22 per month when you purchase a one-, three-, or six- month subscription. When you purchase a year-long subscription at $220, it’s the equivalent of getting 2 months of boxes free! 


What is the total value of the products in The Story of Perfume?
With two exclusive 7ml mini roller fragrances valued at $30 each, plus two 15-30ml samples from our best-selling bath, hair and body line, AND two 2ml samples of our most popular perfumes for women, each box contains approximately $70 worth of products for only $22 monthly!   


Is there any cost to sign up?
No! There is no cost to sign up, and users can order one month at a time instead of opting in for a longer subscription. That way, you can stop receiving The Story of Perfume boxes whenever you’d like, so there’s no obligation!


How is The Story of Perfume different from other subscription boxes?
Unlike many other subscription beauty boxes, our products are 100% cruelty free, vegan and gluten free. Every Harvey Prince product is made in the USA with the finest natural ingredients and best essential oils. We also offer higher valued products in our boxes, since each month’s box contains two full-sized mini roller fragrances.    

Risks/Challenges 

Wearing perfume is perhaps one of the most intimate and personal products a woman will apply on her body. A customer may wonder to herself, how can I be sure I’ll like a fragrance if I’ve never smelled it before? 
Whether you consider yourself a perfumista or a novice to the fragrance world, each Story of Perfume box allows you to try at a minimum four different fragrances every month: two private blend, generously sized mini rollers and two samples of our most popular perfumes. All categories of perfume notes are typically covered in each Harvey Prince fragrance for complete olfactory bliss! From citrus to florals, gourmand to wood notes, and many, many more, you’re virtually guaranteed to find a Harvey Prince fragrance that strikes your fancy and becomes your signature scent with The Story of Perfume box. The Story of Perfume box not only gives you diverse luxury fragrance options each month, it also is more affordable and less risky than buying a single perfume from a mass retailer online without having smelled it first! 
How Can You Help?
We understand that not everyone will be able to make a financial contribution to The Story of Perfume, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Share our story on social media and get the word out about the new subscription beauty box that’s changing the fragrance industry, one sweet spritz at a time!

<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What is the biggest challenge to achieving this?</b></i><br/></p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.enablewomen.com/faqs.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gender gap</a>.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;""><strong><i>Is there still a gender gap? </i></strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are still substantial discrepancies between conditions for women and men - the gender gap. Sometimes referred to as the gender divide.<br/><br/>Globally, now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women earn up to 36% less than men (Australia: 18%, US 17.9%) (<a href=""http://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/global-wage-report/2014/lang--en/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UN ILO</a>, <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/gender/data/employment/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OECD</a>)</li>
<li>Women only control a quarter of the world’s wealth (<a href=""https://www.bcg.com/documents/file56704.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boston Consulting Group</a>)</li>
<li>Worldwide, women make up 22% of government (<a href=""http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNWomen</a>)</li>
<li>22% of senior management roles are held by women (<a href=""http://www.grantthornton.global/globalassets/1.-member-firms/global/insights/ibr-charts/ibr2015_wib_report_final.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GTIBR</a>)</li>
<li>31 million girls worldwide are still denied a primary education (<a href=""http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002266/226662e.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNESCO</a>)</li>
<li>Women account for two thirds of the world’s illiterate people. (<a href=""http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002266/226662e.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNESCO</a>)<a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there was no gender gap the world would be a far safer, richer, and healthier place.  Humanity’s progress depends on it. (<a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">McKinsey Global Institute 2015</a>)</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;""><i><b>How can the gender gap be closed?</b></i></p>
<p>By women accessing three important tools to close the gender gap – technology, know how and finance. <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(McKinsey Global Institute 2015)</a></p>
<p><b><i>What does Enable Women enable women to do?</i></b></p>

These are the core offerings from Enable Women to enable women to overcome the gender gap and prosper.</p>
<p><b><i>Who is in the Enable Women Team?</i></b></p>

Our Vision
We have decided to be an unusual business with a social mission to help women to be more successful by giving them tools to help them on this often tough journey.
Our vision is to provide unique, cutting-edge technology, know how and finance to enable women to achieve success on their own terms.  Together, we will reduce the gender gap and make the world a better and fairer place for all.
Hear more about this from our Chairman, Cynthia de Lorenzi:
What is the biggest challenge to achieving this?
The gender gap.
Is there still a gender gap? 
Yes, there are still substantial discrepancies between conditions for women and men - the gender gap. Sometimes referred to as the gender divide.Globally, now:

Women earn up to 36% less than men (Australia: 18%, US 17.9%) (UN ILO, OECD)
Women only control a quarter of the world’s wealth (Boston Consulting Group)
Worldwide, women make up 22% of government (UNWomen)
22% of senior management roles are held by women (GTIBR)
31 million girls worldwide are still denied a primary education (UNESCO)
Women account for two thirds of the world’s illiterate people. (UNESCO)


If there was no gender gap the world would be a far safer, richer, and healthier place.  Humanity’s progress depends on it. (McKinsey Global Institute 2015)
How can the gender gap be closed?
By women accessing three important tools to close the gender gap – technology, know how and finance. (McKinsey Global Institute 2015)
What does Enable Women enable women to do?
Enable Women enables women to access tools for them to enhance their opportunities and successes and make the world a better and fairer place for all.  Enabling them to be effective and equal to men. These are the core offerings from Enable Women to enable women to overcome the gender gap and prosper.
Who is in the Enable Women Team?

We are a team of enthusiastic egalitarians, each with quite different skill sets that we apply to our mission to enable women to access tools for them to enhance their opportunities and successes and make the world a better and fairer place for all.
It's all about fairness for all.

<p><br/></p><p>Why did we invent a table utensil ??    Because there was nothing available to squeeze the lemon into a glass with dignity and clean hands.  ...And wait ...then there was the issue with the seed.  Do I have to say more ? </p><p>A “citrus squeezer” is not exactly “high tech” one might think, but I’ve often wondered why no one has invented an utensil that would eliminate having to make finger contact with sliced lemons / limes? For one, having to squeeze the juice with your fingers promotes contamination, and the desire to get up from your table and go wash your hands, all over the sake of simply wanting some lemon / lime juice in your drink or on your food (great for oysters as well!) .</p>
<p>Having searched the world over for something I could use to squeeze my lemon at the table, or buffet while eliminating falling seeds and messy fingers, and with confidence of not squirting anyone else with the juice. This left me wondering… The utensils I did find were both difficult to use, heavy and cumbersome to clean, basically not the specifics of what I had in mind, which is; </p>
<p>Simple use (one hand)…Easy to clean…Inexpensive and durable. So, since I am called a 'problem solver', and don’t give up easily (just my nature) It had to be done!  And I did it with the help of a small, but smart group of engineers, using the best materials on earth and the smartest “squeezing” technique accommodating citrus slices of all kind. A wonderful, convenient, colorful, high quality, dishwasher safe, handy citrus squeezer! For convenience in restaurants, bars, catering, home kitchens, and also makes a unique marketing tool that can be personalized with your logo.   </p><p>I short words </p><p><b>""It can be used by anyone, everywhere with ease and convenience""</b>                                                                           </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463495333/DSCF6895_atj5zc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 242.49132947976878px;height: 182px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463495182/DSCF6891_nrmxjy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 237.18435754189943px;height: 174px;""/></p><div><b><i>Here is how it works and been used efficiently and with style. </i></b></div><div>

<p>.<b style=""font-size: 36px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our <b>“LEMON HEART”</b> is ready for mass production now and after extensive testing, but we need your help to afford the tooling and pay for the production here in the USA, this is what it is all about for me, knowing it’s typical that these kinds of goods are manufactured in CHINA and it’s not an option I’m willing to consider.  I am done with low quality products, and want it built in the USA !  </p><p><b>We can do it better in the USA.  </b></p>
<p>We have used a Polymer which is used in Spacecraft and for medical Equipment  (FDA approved) which is so tough that you can drive your car over it (we did) and it will not break. You can freeze it and use it without issues or you can leave it on your dashboard in the Florida sun and it will not be harmed. </p>
<p>I have invested a substatial amount of my own money to develop, design and test the <b>LEMON HEART</b> to make it perfect and of help for everyone using it.  </p><p>We are going the INDIEGOGO way because we need a fast market penetration to avoid  copy cats from China using low quality Polymers resulting in disappointing products and damage the <b>Lemon Heart</b> experience.  We want it to be an <b>All American Product</b>, now, and in the future. </p><p>For that  we need a multi cavity tool and good media representation, this being an estimated cost; </p>
<p>- Tooling and initiation cost $47,000</p>
<p>- Targeted Marketing cost $30,000 </p><p>everything is ready to go we just have to be able to pay for it with your help.</p>
<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>The “LEMON HEART” can be used as designed for squeezing lemon &amp; lime slices or wedges as offered in any restaurant today without touching the fruit, without dropping the seed, and without a mess therefore eliminating the need of a plethora of napkins.  It has other uses as well, that we have discovered… like tea bags, picking up oysters on the half shell (after you’ve used it to squeeze some lemon onto your oyster), and also use as a tong for small finger food, imagination is limitless.  </p><h4>

Why did we invent a table utensil ??    Because there was nothing available to squeeze the lemon into a glass with dignity and clean hands.  ...And wait ...then there was the issue with the seed.  Do I have to say more ? A “citrus squeezer” is not exactly “high tech” one might think, but I’ve often wondered why no one has invented an utensil that would eliminate having to make finger contact with sliced lemons / limes? For one, having to squeeze the juice with your fingers promotes contamination, and the desire to get up from your table and go wash your hands, all over the sake of simply wanting some lemon / lime juice in your drink or on your food (great for oysters as well!) .
Having searched the world over for something I could use to squeeze my lemon at the table, or buffet while eliminating falling seeds and messy fingers, and with confidence of not squirting anyone else with the juice. This left me wondering… The utensils I did find were both difficult to use, heavy and cumbersome to clean, basically not the specifics of what I had in mind, which is; 
Simple use (one hand)…Easy to clean…Inexpensive and durable. So, since I am called a 'problem solver', and don’t give up easily (just my nature) It had to be done!  And I did it with the help of a small, but smart group of engineers, using the best materials on earth and the smartest “squeezing” technique accommodating citrus slices of all kind. A wonderful, convenient, colorful, high quality, dishwasher safe, handy citrus squeezer! For convenience in restaurants, bars, catering, home kitchens, and also makes a unique marketing tool that can be personalized with your logo.   I short words ""It can be used by anyone, everywhere with ease and convenience""                                                                            Here is how it works and been used efficiently and with style. 


.What We Need & What You Get
Our “LEMON HEART” is ready for mass production now and after extensive testing, but we need your help to afford the tooling and pay for the production here in the USA, this is what it is all about for me, knowing it’s typical that these kinds of goods are manufactured in CHINA and it’s not an option I’m willing to consider.  I am done with low quality products, and want it built in the USA !  We can do it better in the USA.  
We have used a Polymer which is used in Spacecraft and for medical Equipment  (FDA approved) which is so tough that you can drive your car over it (we did) and it will not break. You can freeze it and use it without issues or you can leave it on your dashboard in the Florida sun and it will not be harmed. 
I have invested a substatial amount of my own money to develop, design and test the LEMON HEART to make it perfect and of help for everyone using it.  We are going the INDIEGOGO way because we need a fast market penetration to avoid  copy cats from China using low quality Polymers resulting in disappointing products and damage the Lemon Heart experience.  We want it to be an All American Product, now, and in the future. For that  we need a multi cavity tool and good media representation, this being an estimated cost; 
- Tooling and initiation cost $47,000
- Targeted Marketing cost $30,000 everything is ready to go we just have to be able to pay for it with your help.
The Impact
The “LEMON HEART” can be used as designed for squeezing lemon & lime slices or wedges as offered in any restaurant today without touching the fruit, without dropping the seed, and without a mess therefore eliminating the need of a plethora of napkins.  It has other uses as well, that we have discovered… like tea bags, picking up oysters on the half shell (after you’ve used it to squeeze some lemon onto your oyster), and also use as a tong for small finger food, imagination is limitless.  
           Lemons are healthy              
Risks & Challenges
There is no risk for you not getting what we promise. 
The “Lemon Heart” is currently in limited production.  However, our current single cavity tool is producing at a very slow pace in our test facility. We have a “Patent Pending” and “LEMON HEART” is a Trademark.
Our goal is to make our citrus squeezer here in the USA, with high quality materials and product integrity and have this utensil available to everyone as soon as possible so we can ensure it to be an All American Product with opportunity to expand into other countries with confidence and the financial strength needed to do so.        We need YOUR  help.                 Pick   > Rotate  > Squeeze                                                                             ENJOY
Other Ways You Can Help To Make This World A Better Place… 
It would make a difference to help spread the news about the LEMON HEART and its conveniences, since every citrus lover would appreciate! Take a look at the video (www.lemonhearts.com) and enjoy the fun music of the Lemon Squeezer Band, if you love it, please share it!

Although I had friends who had experienced first hand this dreadful disease, I never realized just how bad it impacts ones life. It wasn't easy for me to watch my Father deteriorate over time. It also wasn't easy for me to know that although he was physically healthy for his age, a stressful life had only accelerated and worsened his condition. Since his recent passing I've vowed to do my part to raise awareness on preventing and reducing the impact of this disease. A key part of this awareness is supporting an overall healthy lifestyle. Not physically healthy but an overall balance which includes your body, mind and soul.<br/>

My name is Stathy, founder of the Detach™ brand. 3 years ago when my Father was diagnosed with Alzheimers it was a very sad day for myself and my family. Although I had friends who had experienced first hand this dreadful disease, I never realized just how bad it impacts ones life. It wasn't easy for me to watch my Father deteriorate over time. It also wasn't easy for me to know that although he was physically healthy for his age, a stressful life had only accelerated and worsened his condition. Since his recent passing I've vowed to do my part to raise awareness on preventing and reducing the impact of this disease. A key part of this awareness is supporting an overall healthy lifestyle. Not physically healthy but an overall balance which includes your body, mind and soul.
This campaign will raise funds to increase awareness of Alzheimers and preventative measures, directly sponsor local events on June 20th (The Longest Day) and directly contribute to the Alzheimers Association.
What is    ?
Detach™ at the core is a drive for a more healthy and sustainable lifestyle. It is not just about being physically healthy but being healthy in your heart, mind, body and soul with no-compromises! The Detach™ brand will start with an all organic beverage line with functional benefits for a wide variety of athletic endeavors. A portion of all profits from the beverage brand will be donated to charity.

Today, your contribution will help bootstrap our campaign against Alzheimers. A part of this campaign will include athleisure (clothing) products representing your desire to also support Alzheimers awareness and a more healthy lifestyle. In addition, Detach will sponsor several events in the upcoming year related to Alzheimers and a healthy lifestyle. On ""The Longest Day"", the Alzheimers awareness day we will sponsor several events in the local Bay Area advocating life, health and the fight against Alzheimers.


So you know your support for this campaign goes directly to helping a great movement and supporting key charitable events as well.
What We Need & What You Get

 The $15k goal is an amount to be used to create an athleisure line that will help raise awareness against Alzheimers and support key events over the next year.
More specifically the funds will be used to:

Exclusive and early access perks for you! --> Custom Alzheimers awareness athleisure wear.
Sponsoring events on June 20th, The Longest Day to raise awareness and fight Alzheimers.
Local events sponsoring Alzheimers awareness and healthy living.
Direct contribution to Alzheimers Association to help research a cure and improve life dealing with Alzheimers.
Early access to Detach™ product, subscription discounts and using your purchases to support ongoing contributions to charities.
 





  The Impact 

Fight Alzheimers.

Fight causes and accelerators of Alzheimers.

Promote preventative measures to Alzheimers and negative effects of it.
Be a better human :)

<p>My name is Ian Lausell, I live in the beautiful town of Cayutaville, NY.  At the age of 15 I had the opportunity to travel to the south of France with my father in search of our family roots.  We were in a rural area where goose and duck products were plentiful.  My initial hesitation at eating something new was wiped away by my first taste of Foie Gras, then the confit of goose leg and thigh blew my mind again, I immediately had a new favorite meat.  We also ate potatoes fried in goose fat which put our french fries to shame.  I returned with a newfound love of geese and the products made from them.  In 2008 I took a design course with Finger Lakes Permaculture and later purchased 16 acres of forest and field in Cayutaville.  I worked food related jobs from farm to market to kitchen to table.  When I learned about Pateria de Sousa in Spain and their ability to produce the finest Foie without force-feeding, all the pieces finally fit together.  I can't wait to bring these delicious products to you and share the experience of gourmet goose products in the Finger Lakes. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Finger Lakes Foie.  
We aim to produce the finest 
goose products from happy geese, using Permaculture strategies and principles on a diversified farm.The Finger Lakes Foie Mission
To produce the best goose products, through the most humane means.  
To keep alive the tradition of raising and eating geese.
To produce high quality Foie Gras without force-feeding using Permaculture principles and strategies. 
To nurture healthy and happy geese as part of a resilient and diversified farm, producing geese, pigs, fruits, nuts, and more.  
To create a happy and healthy work environment for myself and my employees.
To create living-wage jobs.
To encourage local production of quality meats.
To complement the already established food and wine industry in the Finger Lakes.
To establish a new local industry that can grow to include many farms raising geese to be sold under the Finger Lakes Foie brand.
                Our ProductsPasture raised goose meat and traditional goose products, including:
Foie Gras 
Confit of Foie Gras 
Confit of goose leg/thigh 
Pâtés
Breasts 
Sausage
Whole Geese

Our Method


The most ethical way of producing Foie, is also the most ecologically sound, and delicious.  

We use no antibiotics or hormones in our feed, no pesticides or herbicides in our pasture.  Our geese are provided with ample pasture, protection from predators, locally sourced grain, and clean water.  Geese eat mostly grasses and clover, making them ideally suited to pasture.  Slow-growing geese are harvested in summer.


When the weather gets cold, they begin eating heavily, fattening themselves before harvest.   Over time our fruit and nut trees will mature, reducing the need for grain in the fall and enhancing the quality of our goose products.  Pigs are rotated through the pastures before the geese, creating lush pastures, an ideal environment for geese.  The combination of geese and pigs rotating on pasture builds topsoil and fertility year after year.    
Roaming Root's pigs at Lausell Farms 
Pigs were rotated through part of the pasture in 2014 with very positive results.  The picture below shows what the ground looked like before pigs did their work and after.

The Impact
Increased access to gourmet goose products produced in the U.S.A.
Your contributions encourage the shift to sustainable local 
economies and ethical farming practices.  
You'll help create jobs, and increase access to ethical and 
environmentally conscious food grown near you.  

Long Term Vision



Finger Lakes Foie will supply fine goose products to consumers in New York State.  Our fruit and nut plantings will grow in the year's to come, increasing sustainability, product quality, and profits, while transforming the landscape into mixed orchard and pasture.  The topsoil will accumulate every year as the pigs and geese do their work.  As our pasture and methods improve Foie production will increase.  When sales reach a high enough level we'll build a usda approved processing facility allowing for expansion to new pastures and more living-wage jobs in the community.



What We Need







$25,000 to establish infrastructure and fund the first season.


Funding will go towards a predator-proof goose shelter that can house 300 geese, movable electric fencing system, goslings, a solar water pump sytem, water storage tanks, feed, vital tools, slaughtering and processing equipment and processing labor cost. Contact me if you want to contribute used equipment or materials. I have a full list of needed items. 

Your contributions will go towards the production of healthy, high quality poultry, produced from pampered geese raised in an environment that they thrive in.  Your contributions increase the food security of the Finger Lakes by producing food locally.  
With full funding to raise 150 geese, it is a sustainable business that can use it's earnings to grow next year.  The land can support 400+ geese, but 100 was the best place to start as it has enough scale to sustain itself,  and allows us to get started, refine our techniques and expand to 300+ geese next year.
Exceeding our goal will allow for increased fruit and nut tree planting and a permanent structure for processing and storage.
If I don't meet my goal, I can scale back and grow from there.

Other Ways You Can Help








Volunteer, meet the geese and learn about the process.
Contributing equipment, materials, or labor.
Eat goose for the holidays.
Get the word out, tell your friends, tell your neighbors.
Use the Indiegogo share tools.


Risks and Challenges



Predator pressure is a concern, there are coyotes in the area.



A well constructed goose shelter will protect the geese while they sleep.
Electric fencing deters predators day and night.
Large flock and bird size intimidates smaller predators like foxes.
Extra protection from birds of prey with net covered area for young goslings.

We need to develop a certified recipe for the confit products


Cornell and Syracuse University both offer many helpful resources to help small producers like Finger Lakes Foie.


At present, we cannot sell across state lines.  




For now I can sell to hotels, restaurants, institutions, and individuals in NYS under the small poultry producers exemption.


In the future we will add a small usda approved processing facility and meat locker onsite, allowing for interstate sales, faster processing, a second flock at another location, more living-wage jobs, and providing poultry processing access and meat storage to the small producers in the area.

<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> As recent transplants from Reading, PA aka ""Pretzel Capitol of the World""  the search was on for a true Philly style soft pretzel here in the Old Pueblo. Sad to say between the mediocre frozen pretzels, like those at sporting events and on some food carts, and the dreaded mall pretzel, we didn't find what our tastebuds were accustomed to and craving. So, what to do? ""Bake your own she said!""</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> After a year and a half of improving upon the old recipe we have nailed it. Our authentic Philly soft pretzels are baked right here in Tucson by a Pennsylvania Dutch baker using only the finest 100% natural ingredients and the traditional German Natronlauge method which produces the signature golden tan crispy shell and a soft chewy inside with a barley malt/caramel finish topped with pretzel salt. There is no butter, sugar, eggs or HFCS in our vegan pretzels.  Currently we sell at local farmers </span>markets<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and with a constant increase of a loyal customer base this has caused us to outgrow our home based business.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> With over 900 food trucks in Tucson, and not a one selling ""fresh </span>baked from scratch right out of the oven""<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> hand rolled &amp; twisted soft pretzels, we have concluded </span>that <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">there is a desire for our healthy treat during </span>this<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> revolution. We will bake our </span>authentic Philly pretzels right on the spot for any event, fundraiser, corporate outing or private party. Our menu will include fresh premium meat sandwiches on our healthy pretzel buns and hopefully in the near future, home-brewed PA Dutch Root Beer! Also keep an eye out for our ""Crabby Pretzel"" -a soft pretzel topped with crab meat with a secret spice recipe finished with pepper jack cheese.  ""Tucson Twist"" -soft pretzel served with our signature dipping sauces consisting of real cheddar cheese sauce, and a variety of mustards. And our ""Hot Knots!"" -just the knots baked with Hatch Chile Peppers and chopped garlic.<br/></p>
<p> Watching the faces of the little ones as they taste their first real soft pretzel is truly satisfying. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our memories of growing up in a town without a pretzel shortage is a good one and we hope to make the memories of you and your children </span>pleasant<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> ones for a long time to come!</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> With your contribution you will be helping more people experience the wholehearted, good old world </span>tradition of the artisan bread that is the soft pretzel. </p>
<p> Please visit our website to learn more about us and why you would want to help fund our food trailer/truck. <a href=""http://www.oldpueblopretzels.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.oldpueblopretzels.com</a> </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p> Truck and/or trailer with equipment. As can be expected by our unique business of baking fresh on site there is a nonexistent supply of food trucks which meet our baking specifications. We do not have the need for deep fryers or other related appliances found on most trucks, also most layouts will call for a total remodel. We feel this is a waste of money and would like to start from the ground up. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have a reputable dealer of new/used equipment and will utilize their service as much as possible. We hope to purchase a 8.5'x14' dual axel trailer or 14' box truck. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Our kitchen will consist of a dough mixer &amp; pretzel warmers which we currently own. Propane oven and tanks for baking. Gas burner for dipping solution of pretzels. Full hood over cooking area with Ansul fire </span>extinguishers.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Snack oven for </span>melting cheese on sandwiches. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Electric hot dog roller. Sandwich making station. </span>Refrigeration and freezer unit. Rooftop AC/Heating unit. Bakers rack and proofing boards. Stainless steel three bay sink with hand washing basin along with fresh and gray water tanks. Hot water on demand with a 110v pump. Stainless steel prep and serving areas.  RV generator. All appropriate lighting/electrical outlets with 50 amp panel and life line. City water connection fresh water spigot. 4x6' Concession window with drop down serving tray. Cabinets where needed. Awning to keep customers shaded on our hot days. Full graphic logo wrap. </p>
<p> If we meet our goal with funding all monies will go towards the designing of trailer/truck and to health department inspections and permits. If we do not meet our goal we will make improvements to our home based bakery (new oven) and continue with possibly a smaller cart in hopes to still have a great start to continue on towards our goal of a trailer/truck.</p>
<ul> </ul>
</div>      <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We know our pretzels! </p>
<p> Old Pueblo Pretzels can't express enough our passion for soft pretzels along with a healthy lifestyle. Bread is and always will be a staple in most everyones diet. We just happen to have a different recipe to offer those who have grown tired of the norm here in the desert. On the East Coast we eat pretzels like others eat bagels and donuts for breakfast, so much so that we love to eat them anytime of the day or night. We love our pretzels and we know you will come to love them as much as we do! There's nothing like a fresh baked hot soft pretzel.</p>
<p> Our loyal growing customer base can attest to the authenticity of our Philly pretzels. And now you can help spread the word here in Tucson as we offer people a delicious choice when it comes time to healthy snacks.</p>
<ul> </ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary

 As recent transplants from Reading, PA aka ""Pretzel Capitol of the World""  the search was on for a true Philly style soft pretzel here in the Old Pueblo. Sad to say between the mediocre frozen pretzels, like those at sporting events and on some food carts, and the dreaded mall pretzel, we didn't find what our tastebuds were accustomed to and craving. So, what to do? ""Bake your own she said!""
 After a year and a half of improving upon the old recipe we have nailed it. Our authentic Philly soft pretzels are baked right here in Tucson by a Pennsylvania Dutch baker using only the finest 100% natural ingredients and the traditional German Natronlauge method which produces the signature golden tan crispy shell and a soft chewy inside with a barley malt/caramel finish topped with pretzel salt. There is no butter, sugar, eggs or HFCS in our vegan pretzels.  Currently we sell at local farmers markets and with a constant increase of a loyal customer base this has caused us to outgrow our home based business.
 With over 900 food trucks in Tucson, and not a one selling ""fresh baked from scratch right out of the oven"" hand rolled & twisted soft pretzels, we have concluded that there is a desire for our healthy treat during this revolution. We will bake our authentic Philly pretzels right on the spot for any event, fundraiser, corporate outing or private party. Our menu will include fresh premium meat sandwiches on our healthy pretzel buns and hopefully in the near future, home-brewed PA Dutch Root Beer! Also keep an eye out for our ""Crabby Pretzel"" -a soft pretzel topped with crab meat with a secret spice recipe finished with pepper jack cheese.  ""Tucson Twist"" -soft pretzel served with our signature dipping sauces consisting of real cheddar cheese sauce, and a variety of mustards. And our ""Hot Knots!"" -just the knots baked with Hatch Chile Peppers and chopped garlic.
 Watching the faces of the little ones as they taste their first real soft pretzel is truly satisfying. Our memories of growing up in a town without a pretzel shortage is a good one and we hope to make the memories of you and your children pleasant ones for a long time to come!
 With your contribution you will be helping more people experience the wholehearted, good old world tradition of the artisan bread that is the soft pretzel. 
 Please visit our website to learn more about us and why you would want to help fund our food trailer/truck. www.oldpueblopretzels.com    What We Need & What You Get  Truck and/or trailer with equipment. As can be expected by our unique business of baking fresh on site there is a nonexistent supply of food trucks which meet our baking specifications. We do not have the need for deep fryers or other related appliances found on most trucks, also most layouts will call for a total remodel. We feel this is a waste of money and would like to start from the ground up. We have a reputable dealer of new/used equipment and will utilize their service as much as possible. We hope to purchase a 8.5'x14' dual axel trailer or 14' box truck. 
 Our kitchen will consist of a dough mixer & pretzel warmers which we currently own. Propane oven and tanks for baking. Gas burner for dipping solution of pretzels. Full hood over cooking area with Ansul fire extinguishers. Snack oven for melting cheese on sandwiches. Electric hot dog roller. Sandwich making station. Refrigeration and freezer unit. Rooftop AC/Heating unit. Bakers rack and proofing boards. Stainless steel three bay sink with hand washing basin along with fresh and gray water tanks. Hot water on demand with a 110v pump. Stainless steel prep and serving areas.  RV generator. All appropriate lighting/electrical outlets with 50 amp panel and life line. City water connection fresh water spigot. 4x6' Concession window with drop down serving tray. Cabinets where needed. Awning to keep customers shaded on our hot days. Full graphic logo wrap. 
 If we meet our goal with funding all monies will go towards the designing of trailer/truck and to health department inspections and permits. If we do not meet our goal we will make improvements to our home based bakery (new oven) and continue with possibly a smaller cart in hopes to still have a great start to continue on towards our goal of a trailer/truck.
 
       The Impact We know our pretzels! 
 Old Pueblo Pretzels can't express enough our passion for soft pretzels along with a healthy lifestyle. Bread is and always will be a staple in most everyones diet. We just happen to have a different recipe to offer those who have grown tired of the norm here in the desert. On the East Coast we eat pretzels like others eat bagels and donuts for breakfast, so much so that we love to eat them anytime of the day or night. We love our pretzels and we know you will come to love them as much as we do! There's nothing like a fresh baked hot soft pretzel.
 Our loyal growing customer base can attest to the authenticity of our Philly pretzels. And now you can help spread the word here in Tucson as we offer people a delicious choice when it comes time to healthy snacks.
 
  Risks & Challenges The obvious challenges are the hoops you're made to jump through by the local city government but all of our research and experience along with our attorney should make this an easy process. Coming from a family full of restaurant and other business owners we have complete faith in our endeavor. 
 All perks will be settled after a 15 day waiting period at the end of the campaign so we can bake accordingly. Any ""William Penn Perks"" will be settled after we take delivery of the trailer.

</h3><p><b>Help a Creative Community
in Cobargo NSW to Grow!</b></p>

Cobargo in Danger of Abandonment?<p></p>
<p>Over the past hundred years or so, small towns in
rural Australia have been victims of the same advances in transportation,
technology and agricultural methods that have brought growth and prosperity to
population centres and large farms. As the small farms and graziers suffered,
so did the people in the towns and villages who supported them. 
           </p>
<p>In years past, the far south coast NSW village of Cobargo
was a thriving place. Farmers, graziers and their families came to town to buy
necessities, to see a blacksmith about repairs, to attend church services or to
send off a letter from the new Post Office.<span> 
Their children attended the local public school. Dairy products from the
town's buttery made their way to Sydney. Local foresters harvested black wattle
bark for tanneries up the coast to Sydney and all the way down to
Melbourne.             
                   
                     
     </span></p>
<p>However, time and progress changed things, and
Cobargo at the start of the 21st Century was not the thriving and bustling
little town that it had been at the beginning of the previous century.  From
the 1980s, extensive periods of drought and the efforts of successive
governments to overhaul and modernise the dairy, fishing and forestry industries
have combined to test our collective community mettle - economically, socially
and philosophically. Like many Bega
Valley towns scarred by the contraction in these industries, Cobargo's cultural
identity was battered; its social and economic fabric was sorely tried.<span>  </span></p>
<p>To address the community outcry, governments
trumpeted and liberally prescribed Tourism as a panacea for all towns and
villages similarly affected by industry realignment and residents were
encouraged to reinvent themselves, their livelihoods and their place in order
to benefit by tapping into this lucrative income stream.<span>  </span></p>
<p>But, despite the village's rural charms and the
villagers' best efforts, convincing the many tourists who pass through Cobargo,
on their way to popular holiday destinations like Bermagui, Tathra, Merimbula,
Pambula and Eden, to stop and spend time in the village was difficult.</p>
<p></p><p><strong>Cobargo Creators and the Cobargo Creators Centre to the Rescue!</strong></p><p></p>
<p>What to do? Well
. . . one local, Suzy McKinnon, had an idea. And, if it worked, it might have enough
of a positive impact to improve the well-being of the townsfolk and secure the
very future of Cobargo itself!</p>
<p>Suzi thought it would be wonderful to create a community
association based on creativity, with the first project to be a gallery (in one
of the vacant storefronts in town) to showcase the amazing creative skills and
talents of townsfolk and other nearby residents. A successful gallery would attract tourists and
other passing traffic and provide additional income for local
participants.  Of course, the merit of Suzy's idea would be for naught
unless the creators in the local area embraced
the endeavour.</p>
<p>And many did. There was Suzy, of course, who
brought her skills as an innovator and long term experience as a community
organiser, along with paintings, textiles, cards and more; Anne Wilson brought
her experience with Transition Towns as well as restored furniture and
jewellery; Sarah Gardiner brought her writing skills, local knowledge and cows
and Richard Lambert brought his administrative nous and stunning
photographs.<span>  </span></p><p><span>With the nucleus of a management committee in

Cobargo (in short, The Cobargo Creators) was born and a new creative vigour
came to the town and neighbouring areas.

</p><p>In the three years since, the Cobargo Creators
membership base has grown from the dozen or so founding members to over 100 creators
who regularly show (and sell!) their creations in the various spaces known
collectively as the Cobargo Creators Centre. In the Centre, the showcase space
- Black Wattle Gallery – and Wares Gifts
are chock full of amazing artworks and handcrafted
household treasures made by its members. </p>
<p>The Association supports young artists with the Sapling
Gallery space, also part of the Centre, facilitates a calendar of workshops
with various renowned local creators and hosts; rolling 'Feature Artist' exhibitions in the
gallery for all interested members and supports all creative ventures in the
region by providing information, advice and a communication network As well as an exhibition and display space the Centre is a community space and is available to be used for
other purposes, such as performances, poetry readings, launches etc., by

</div></div>","Short Summary


I, am the Hon. Neville ORiley Livingston OJ, CD pka Bunny Wailer. I am the founding and surviving member of THE WAILERS, also consisting of the Late Hon. Robert Nesta 'Bob' Marley O.M. and the Hon. Winston Hubert McIntosh O.M. pka Peter Tosh.

The historic 'Ganja Bill' was passed into Law in Jamaica , April 15th, 2015. The Rastafari Community has been campaigning for many decades for the recognition of our culture, belief and faith.  This means also the recognition of the Rastafari Sacrament globally, this to include the ceremonial and spiritual medicinal and therapeutic use of Ganja.


THE TIME IS RIGHT - As social awareness of our faith and the Rastafari culture as a whole has advanced, so has the global understanding of the use of Ganja as part of our Sacrament.
THE WAILERS have established Rastafari and Ganja as a Sacrament and are Ambassadors for Legalization Nationally and Internationally.

 The effort is starting to produce results, and we are almost there.  However there are some serious final hurdles legal hurdles to achieve Equal Rights & Justice as we were equally warned by American President Barack Obama who made a historic visit to Jamaica on April 7th, 2015, that we have to protect our socio-economic rights from Big Business.With the passage of the Ganja Bill in Jamaica historically recognizing our Sacramental Rights in national law, we are now in a position to take the next steps nationally and internationally.

Before the Rastafari Faith is effectively whipped out by opportunistic Ganja Business Interests, it is essential to achieve socio-economic justice for Rastafari all over the World.  The 'Legalize It!' Campaign starts from the Jamaican people who have been persecuted for over 100 Years for defending the Human Rights of their culture and beliefs, as the perfect place to set the standard.Earlier in my life, I served 18 months imprisonment in 1967 for being in THE WAILERS rehearsal yard in Trench Town, now a heritage site, where Ganja is regularly used in creating the music and messages of Rastafari Faith.  I was still forced to serve this sentence, even though the case was withdrawn for lack of evidence of my involvement.  I was sentenced by prejudiced individuals and not the Law.  This has to be corrected!  I was only able to confirm what I knew as I later toured as Bunny Wailer and challenged by Custom authorities and all of this for practicing my faith and this great Reggae Music.  With the Ganja Bill passage there is a 'Public Smoking' Cigarette Law that has been imposed on Ganja Smokers that has created a new form of criminalization.Throughout the Rastafari Reggae world I am often asked by people, what they can do to help the 'Legalize It!' cause.  I, nor Peter Tosh's label, Intel Diplo Enterprises, have ever asked for help, as the time was never as right as it is now.  Now Is The Time!
Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin Enterprises and one of the Global Leaders leading the charge for Global Change in Drug Policy at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session in 2016, has spoken of the seminal role Peter Tosh played in his life and his current positions. http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/cannabis-regulation-in-jamaica-and-alaska#LegalizeIt
'The Voice Of The People' supported by those who have been inspired personally and economically by and through Reggae Music for the past 50 Years is now needed to help in the funding of this campaign.    
For Jamaica this can only be achieved through global public support for proper Policy development in Jamaica where a history of abuse of Rastafari has resulted in deep engrained prejudices and where the Commercial branding deals are already capitalizing on the sacrifice of all the Rastafari Community.  All for just personal gain without returning anything to the Community, plainly being in contradiction with the Faith they used to gain value.  The Rastafari Sacramental Rights In The 'Ganja Bill' does not give any Economic Rights to the Rastafari Faith!   What We Need & What You Get I, Bunny Wailer, have personally funded and supported Legalize It! Ganja Campaigns in Jamaica since the first Ganja March in the world in 1996 up to the latest Ganja March and Rally in Trench Town on April 20th, 2014 in Kingston and will be staging the first Global Ganja March in Jamaica on May 2nd, 2015. The Peter Tosh Estate has collaborated with GreenPeace and Amnesty International to support Legalize It Campaigns globally.  This is your chance to join us all in this massively important task to save all aspects of Rastafarian culture.
Such is the injustice suffered and continuing prejudice to date, that we have to move mountains, as such the level of the funding request is important.  Being the first to take part in raising funds, is your chance to participate directly and impact this matter, for which I and all the Rastafari Community all over the World will thank you in advance.
Establishing the Rastafari Right is a national and international effort that requires exceptional legal representation, intellectual property registration, national and international community company registration, public education and community mobilization.
HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED
All the money received will be dedicated to servicing the Rastafari Community and principally in securing all the relevant steps 
1.  WAILERS ONE LOVE 'Legalize It!"" Campaign For The Protection Of Rastafari Culture And Rights In Ganja and Reggae.   Print, Media, Event Campaign From Trench Town To 5 other Major Urban and Rural Centers throughout Jamaica and through to the Jamaica Diaspora Communities in Miami, New York, Atlanta, London and the legalized states of Washington DC, Colorado, California, Toronto, to gain a people based national and international support for fair and proper regulatory framework in Jamaica. 
2. Securing Identified Lawyers, Strategy Consultants and a  Cultural Valuation Expert and provide for their work and accommodation here in Jamaica to shape a policy and business model that recognizes, strategizes, protects and monetizes Rastafari cultural and international brand value acknowledged as being in the billions.

The Rastafari Authenticity and Branding is a known value that is trading globally through festivals, lifestyle brands, tourism and alike.  It has become valuable based on its survival mechanisms against insurmountable odds and has become conversant with the new 'Green Economy' and 'Climate Change' standards of the Millennarian Consumer.  
Legalization of Ganja In Jamaica, properly designed intellectual property rights, can usher in  new social and economic policies around the world particularly in countries like South Africa and Brazil.

</div></div>","THE VISIONHello, my name is Bernd Zikulnig. I'm a 33 year old pilot, a former professional soldier, and I'm the founder of peacebucks - free money!One day I thought: ""If money is the reason for war, it is the solution for peace.""This was the exact moment when the idea of peacebucks was born.Did you know that most wars are primarily conducted, or not conducted, because of financial interests of multi-billion dollar corporations? In contrast to that, the individual human life is nothing worth anymore. We're creating a new global currency that will narrow the gap between the financial elite and the world's population - we don't need war for economic growth, we need peacebucks.



""One world, one currency, one peace!""
WHAT IS PEACEBUCKS
It's a new online currency (PBS) using an independent payment system for money transfer through the internet worldwide. Use it to pay online or via mobile. It's easy, it's fast, it's safe! Even more, it's a vision of free money, basic income and peace. It's a unique game changer.



""Technically, it's similar to PayPal, but with its own currency."" 



BETTER THAN FOR FREE

With the concept of peacebucks, electronic money (PBS) is generated by every private user automatically, every month. The more that people register, the more capital is generated worldwide. Because of that, companies will join and accept it too; in turn, a new currency is born. In addition, PBS can be bought directly through every account. 


ADVANTAGES

peacebucks combines a free market economy with basic human rights. On the one hand, it's additional free capital for private individuals; while on the other hand, it acts a new sales option for companies. It's a digital complementary currency providing additional value for society.





""The value of money exists only in the imagination of people. I personally prefer carrots."" (Luna, peacebucks Marketing and PR dwarf rabbit)



CONVERSION RATEAn algorithm for global currency translation reduces the risk of speculative transactions and ensures a high stability of money. In addition, PBS cannot be changed back to other currencies - PBS stay PBS.PEACEBUCKS RATE = (USD RATE + EUR RATE) ÷ 2


PRIVATE ACCOUNTSHave you ever dreamed of earning free money or that money grew on trees?Let your dreams come true, join peacebucks as private user.

Your benefits
Free account


300 PBS monthly
Paying with and sending PBS is free
Receiving PBS only costs a few PBS







BUSINESS ACCOUNTS


Support the idea of free money, basic income and peace by accepting it for your business. The account is for free as well. The only difference to private accounts is that business accounts will not be credited with PBS for free.
Join peacebucks to generate an additional turnover, to acquire new clients, and to brand your company as global peace player. By the way, you will also make the world a better place.

FUNDING & MORE




 Programming a state-of-the-art online payment software, using its own currency, is neither easy nor cheap. Funds are required to develop and improve the software according to the highest technology standards and to host it on a high security server farm. 


""Help us to get started, support the vision of of free money, basic income and peace. ""




RISKS & CHALLENGES  Damn it, it would be easier to mention things that are not risky and challenging for this project. Let's keep it simple; this project is absolute crazy.
The probability that my startup will become a multi-million dollar company that is able to affect world peace is indeed not the highest. But damn, I like the idea and I will try my best.



It is very likely that I will take the 300 USD that my grandmother is investing, together with the rest of the generated funds here, probably additional 30 dollar, and buy a few beers and invite my friends over to a party. ;-)


No, seriously. As long as we cannot go online with a fully functional page, it is very difficult to convince people to join peacebucks. Only a huge number of users will attract companies, which will allow concept to start working. To break this cycle, it is important to develop a state of the art peacebucks page as soon as possible. That's why I'm here.

<p>Bookstores are all about cultivating stories. They are the heartbeat of a community, and they reflect the interests, passions, needs and desires of the communities that house them. Thank-you for taking the time to explore my pitch page. My name is Melissa Bourdon-King, and I will be opening <i>Once Upon a Bookstore</i> in the heart of Kelowna's Pandosy Village in July of 2019. As you read a little about me and my vision, it is my sincerest hope you will discover your own desire to be part of the continuing story of <i>Once Upon a Bookstore</i>.</p>
<h2>A window into my story</h2>
<p>I have been a bookseller for more than twelve years. My passion for the industry began in a high-school classroom in Toronto when, in a mandatory career class, I was asked to think about my dream job. At 15, I hadn't ever really thought about what kind of job I was interested in, but I did know where I loved to be-- Mabel's Fables Children's Bookstore in Toronto. Since the age of 3 my mom had taken me there to find fantastic reads, and it was still the best place to browse around, chat with the amazing staff, and find that next magical something. Sitting in that classroom I thought, ""Who wouldn't want to work at a bookstore? I'll pretend to apply there!"" Except the application became real. With the help of my mom, I wrote a cover letter, sent in my resume and was hired! I could not have been more thrilled, nor could I have known that working there would shape my identity and set my course: a lifelong passion for books.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe what it is about bookselling that is so intoxicating, but I will tell you that for the two years I wasn't working in a bookstore, I longed for the familiar satisfaction of knowing I'd put the perfect book into someone's hands. When I worked at Mabel's Fables, I planned events, I met authors, I read to children, I played 'can you help me find the book whose title I can't remember?' with customers. I used my creative brain, my management brain, and my community outreach brain. Bookstores house stories, and stories have the power to change lives, and even if they don't dramatically alter someone's path, reading books shapes people. Do you remember some of your favourite books as a child? I do, and they are titles that continue to hold an important place in my memory because I was forever altered by reading them. People remember their favourite books, especially books that moved them as children, and they speak about them with a reverence that is hypnotic.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2018, I was doing a lot of self-reflection, and I decided to take a leap of faith and attend the Paz and Associates Bookseller Bootcamp in Florida (<a href=""http://pazbookbiz.com/owning-a-bookstore-the-workshop-retreat/).%C2%A0Attending"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://pazbookbiz.com/owning-a-bookstore-the-wo...</a> the conference really opened the floodgates for my creative brain. I was surrounded by like-minded, passionate individuals, and their camaraderie fuelled me. The name and a logo idea for the bookstore popped into my mind, and from there, the ideas just kept coming. I thought about all the community endeavors I wanted to cultivate and support, from bookclubs and private shopping nights, to school bookfairs and parent night fundraisers.  I want to create a safe and welcoming space for local community groups (moms, dads, bookclubs, etc). I would like to provide meeting space to community organizations, like Girl Guides of Canada, and host family-friendly events like board game nights and art classes. </p>
<p>Deciding to open my own children's bookstore has at times been a scary and daunting prospect. For every exciting idea that I get fired up about, there is usually a financial or administrative hurdle that needs to be overcome. Despite the wealth of experience I have in the industry, I know that the entrepreneurial route is filled with unexpected challenges and obstacles. Yet I consider myself privileged to know that following this path is my passion, and that knowing this is my passion is a gift. Regardless of the challenges, this is something I am doing because I have to-- because it is who I am.</p>

<h3>
<i>Once Upon a Bookstore's </i>Story</h3>
<p>In order to open <i>Once Upon a Bookstore, </i> a total investment of about $140,000 is needed, and more than $70,000 of this cost will be filling the store with inventory- books, toys, games, puzzles, art, etc. The remainder of that money has gone/will go to construction costs, renovating, purchasing furniture and fixtures, legal fees, city and building permits, hardware, software, insurance costs, and prepaid expenses like having a telephone and internet service. </p>
<p>While finances and financial management are an important part of any healthy business, costs are not what <i>Once Upon a Bookstore </i>is about. My vision for this bookstore is about filling a hole I see in our community, and using my passion and expertise to meet that need. Kelowna is home to more than 24,000 children, and that number more than doubles when considering the Okanagan region. As a parent myself, I volunteer my time on the Parent Advisory Council for my daughter's school and also serve with Girl Guides of Canada. I take my daughter to swimming lessons at Parkinson Rec, and to dance classes around the city. I see how many families there are and I want to foster their ability to be part of something they consider theirs--a store guided by their needs.</p>
<p>Bookstores are a place to buy books, of course, but they can also be so much more. <i>Once Upon a Bookstore </i>will be such a place-- an event space for the community. It will connect local, Canadian and international authors and illustrators with Okanagan readers. It will unite new moms and dads with classes, support systems and safe spaces. It will welcome families of all shapes, sizes, varieties and cultures to feel safe and find their stories on our shelves. It will encourage creativity in all forms through workshops, classes, and discussion groups. It will listen to new ideas and be a base point to launch those new ideas, for young and old. It will give back to the local community through supporting literacy efforts, school groups, and community-minded organizations. In short, <i>Once Upon a Bookstore </i>will grow and evolve based on what its community--<strong>you--</strong>needs it to be.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here is how your dollars will help contribute to <i>Once Upon a Bookstore's </i>story:</p>
<ul><li>First of all- THE PERKS! The perks are for you! They are an acknowledgement of your part in our story. We have so many exciting offerings: stickers, bookmarks, magnets, tote bags, recommendation shelves, subscription services, bookstore birthday and cocktail parties! My personal favourite perk is asking you to 'Be My Book Valentine'. Many hours were spent thinking about what perks would best represent my gratitude for your support, and which ones would be the most fun to experience.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>This project is not just for me, it is for <strong>our community, </strong>our children, our families, our friends. This campaign is about bringing together booklovers, and having them contribute, so what they love being available in a store. So many beloved children's books have shaped people's lives, I want to hear those stories and be able to share those stories with everyone who walks through the door, or who discovers us online. <i>Once Upon a Bookstore</i> is going to be warm and welcoming, where families always feel accepted, and where parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends can ask for help finding the perfect book and know they are receiving expert advice from a passionate individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Bookstores are the heartbeat of local communities. We provide safe spaces and nurture the local market- from hosting events, to promoting local and Canadian authors and illustrators, to being a safe space for the community to meet, whether bookclubs, mom groups, classes for parents and babies, discussion groups, or art classes. These are just a few of the ideas I have to bring together families in Kelowna.</p></li>
<li><p>For over twelve wonderful years, I worked for, and then managed an independent children's bookstore in Toronto. Some of my favourite memories are hosting author events, both in store and in school classrooms, and watching the magic of an author interacting with a child. It is this magic that I hope to bring to the more-than-24,000 Okanagan school children</p></li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Even if this goal is not fully funded, every penny raised will go towards making sure the store is full of stories, so that I can continue to focus on supporting the community and building relationships that will help us all thrive.</li></ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Let's be honest, there are a lot of risks, and many significant challenges in opening any bookstore, let alone a children's bookstore. Amazon's deep discounting and large warehouses are probably at the forefront of people's minds as being the biggest challenge bookstores face. But there are some really important things online retailing just cannot provide: the most important one being personal service. Check out the link below:</p>

<p>Personal service and community-building are the foundations upon which I will build <i>Once Upon a Bookstore</i>. I love children's books, and my endless enthusiasm extends not only to the books themselves, but also to the authors, illustrators and publishers who bring stories to life. <i>Once Upon a Bookstore</i> will play an important role in contributing to the ecosystem of the bookloving community, and we have the strength, resilience, expertise and grace to tackle any challenge that comes our way. Should we feel unsure in the face of a new challenge, we can turn to our bookselling colleagues, whose community always offers each other help and support.</p>

<p><b>A little about Us</b></p>
<p>I'm Walter Jahncke and I'm Michele and these are
our children - Walter, Barton, Milton, Amelie and Ren.
Together we began operating the Historic Northside Café on the town square of
Winterset, Iowa nearly four years ago, and now we are opening a brewery.<br/>
</p>
<p><span>Our adventure began nearly 8 years ago, when, with no
job or real plan we just up and moved - 5 home schooled kids, mom, dad, faith
that God would care for us and a dream of a simpler life in the country. We
left the city and moved to an acreage about 30 miles southwest of Des Moines in
Madison County. We had no idea what would happen next.<br/>
<i>No adventure would be complete without a little adversity. By late 2011, with
our savings depleted and no clear prospects for a good income in Madison
County, we were running out of options. When an opportunity presented itself -
we took another leap of faith. The Historic Northside Café was available for
sale, right on the square of downtown Winterset. We put up our house as
collateral, and took over operations in March of 2012.</i></span></p><i>
</i><p><b><span></span></b></p><b>
</b><p><b><i><span>Where
are we now?</span></i></b></p>
<p>It has not been easy resurrecting a small town café in
middle America. The community needed time to get to know us. The building needed
a lot more upgrades than we could possibly accomplish all at once. Growth was
slower than we had hoped. But as we approach our fourth year of steady growth
at the Northside, things have never looked better and we are embracing a new
opportunity - opening our own brewery - Middle River Brewing Co.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">                                                                       </span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454474956/kaxsznr6128ro3uvcjdy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 230.14678899082568px;height: 333px;""/></p>
<p>There’s a lot to do when pulling together a
brewery, and like the café this needs a lot of upgrades to bring it to code and
keep its historic value. We've knocked out almost every wall and taken it down
to the original local hardwood frame and our equipment has been delivered. The
paper work is coming together and we're starting to hunt for as many
locally sourced ingredients as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Where
are we headed?</i></b></p>
<p>Once open we will be brewing on an electric 3-barrel
brew system. Our beer and soft drinks will be available to drink in the café / tap room,
to take with you in growlers or limited release 750 ml bottles, and sold
in kegs to local festivals, bars and restaurants. </p>
<p><b><i>Why
do we need your help?</i></b></p>
<p>Opening your own business in a historic
building is always expensive and a brewery is no exception. This Indiegogo
campaign will help cover expenses of meeting code upgrades, acquiring native
materials to keep the building authentic, and finally add a solar powered system.
We have never been a family to ask for charity, but a little help from you
buying a T-shirt, or beer for life will go a long way toward making the brewery
your favorite place to hang out and have a beer and a meal.</p>
<p><b><i>What
will your money be going toward?</i></b></p>
<p>Any money raised through crowdfunding will be
split into three areas:</p>
<p>First, acquiring native materials (local
milled rough sawn wood, and locally quarried rock) for the build out of the brewery.
 Our goal is to use 100% local
craftsmen and businesses to support our small town economy.</p>
<p>Second, we will be spending any crowd funding
money on adding a solar system to reduce our energy footprint by 40%.</p>
<p>Third, to cover the cost of any code upgrades
needed for staying in compliance with the historic status of the building and
the square, i.e. a new fire suppression system (man are those expensive!!).</p><p> Across America small
towns are dying, and many of their iconic small town businesses are dying with
them. The Northside Café has been operating for more than 140 years, and the
town square is a Historic Commercial District on the National Historic
Register. We want to make sure Middle River Brewing handles our construction
with the same respect we have endeavored with the Café.</p>
<p>Anything we raise beyond our goals will go
toward an awesome preview party.</p>
<p><b><i>How
can you help?</i></b></p>
<p>First, you can get the word out about Middle
River Brewing on social media. Share the link to our Indiegogo page on your
Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other social media sites.</p>
<p>Second, you can help us reach our pledge goal.
Indiegogo works by allowing supporters to pledge money in return for awesome
tiered perks. When our campaign is complete pledgers
are charged the amount they pledged and perks are distributed.</p>

</div></div>","Here
in Iowa we know how things grow. We know about roots, and just like plants,
people have roots.  Historic people and places help keep us rooted, connected,
and strong -  
Middle
River Brewing Co. is a microbrewery built above the 140 yr old historic Northside
Café. Set to open this summer on the town square in Winterset,
Iowa. 
We are known
for: ·  Covered Bridges
of Madison County
· 
Birthplace of John Wayne
· 
Birthplace of the Delicious
apple
· 
George Washington Carver
· 
And Monuments Man George
L. Stout
We will produce two year-round flagship beers
and one flagship soft drink (non-alcoholic) : a traditional Bohemian Pilsner, a
traditional American stout, and a historic sarsaparilla. These will be joined
by rotating seasonal brews, limited release beers, Iowa native guest beers and
tasting room-only experimental beers.
A little about Us
I'm Walter Jahncke and I'm Michele and these are
our children - Walter, Barton, Milton, Amelie and Ren.
Together we began operating the Historic Northside Café on the town square of
Winterset, Iowa nearly four years ago, and now we are opening a brewery.

Our adventure began nearly 8 years ago, when, with no
job or real plan we just up and moved - 5 home schooled kids, mom, dad, faith
that God would care for us and a dream of a simpler life in the country. We
left the city and moved to an acreage about 30 miles southwest of Des Moines in
Madison County. We had no idea what would happen next.
No adventure would be complete without a little adversity. By late 2011, with
our savings depleted and no clear prospects for a good income in Madison
County, we were running out of options. When an opportunity presented itself -
we took another leap of faith. The Historic Northside Café was available for
sale, right on the square of downtown Winterset. We put up our house as
collateral, and took over operations in March of 2012.

Where
are we now?
It has not been easy resurrecting a small town café in
middle America. The community needed time to get to know us. The building needed
a lot more upgrades than we could possibly accomplish all at once. Growth was
slower than we had hoped. But as we approach our fourth year of steady growth
at the Northside, things have never looked better and we are embracing a new
opportunity - opening our own brewery - Middle River Brewing Co.                                                                       
There’s a lot to do when pulling together a
brewery, and like the café this needs a lot of upgrades to bring it to code and
keep its historic value. We've knocked out almost every wall and taken it down
to the original local hardwood frame and our equipment has been delivered. The
paper work is coming together and we're starting to hunt for as many
locally sourced ingredients as possible.

Where
are we headed?
Once open we will be brewing on an electric 3-barrel
brew system. Our beer and soft drinks will be available to drink in the café / tap room,
to take with you in growlers or limited release 750 ml bottles, and sold
in kegs to local festivals, bars and restaurants. 
Why
do we need your help?
Opening your own business in a historic
building is always expensive and a brewery is no exception. This Indiegogo
campaign will help cover expenses of meeting code upgrades, acquiring native
materials to keep the building authentic, and finally add a solar powered system.
We have never been a family to ask for charity, but a little help from you
buying a T-shirt, or beer for life will go a long way toward making the brewery
your favorite place to hang out and have a beer and a meal.
What
will your money be going toward?
Any money raised through crowdfunding will be
split into three areas:
First, acquiring native materials (local
milled rough sawn wood, and locally quarried rock) for the build out of the brewery.
 Our goal is to use 100% local
craftsmen and businesses to support our small town economy.
Second, we will be spending any crowd funding
money on adding a solar system to reduce our energy footprint by 40%.
Third, to cover the cost of any code upgrades
needed for staying in compliance with the historic status of the building and
the square, i.e. a new fire suppression system (man are those expensive!!). Across America small
towns are dying, and many of their iconic small town businesses are dying with
them. The Northside Café has been operating for more than 140 years, and the
town square is a Historic Commercial District on the National Historic
Register. We want to make sure Middle River Brewing handles our construction
with the same respect we have endeavored with the Café.
Anything we raise beyond our goals will go
toward an awesome preview party.
How
can you help?
First, you can get the word out about Middle
River Brewing on social media. Share the link to our Indiegogo page on your
Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other social media sites.

of Madison county has so much to offer.

</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but autism has probably touched the life of somebody
you know. Better yet, imagine receiving an autism diagnosis for your child.
What would you do? Who would you turn to for help and support? What about when they grow up; who will hire them?  How will they receive the skills needed to reach their full potential?  Early
identification, intensive therapy and transition services typically help these children and their
families overcome the educational challenges presented by autism, but this has
proven an overwhelming task for our autism resource providers in Northeast Florida to
undertake alone.</p>
<p>That’s where the Making Strides For Autism Parent Resource Center and Autism Youth Project come in.  Families are faced with fear, uncertainty,
and in many cases the feeling of being completely alone. <strong>We need YOUR
help to give parents of children with autism the parent to parent support they
need through support, training and advocacy programs. As well as assessing youth with autism's strengths and transition those strengths into a career which will allow them to live as independently as possible. <br/></strong></p>
<p><br/><strong></strong></p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a mother of a son
on the autism spectrum, I asked myself recently what is that I can do that will
help fellow autism parents the most as they start their autism journey. What do
we need the most that is not offered in Northeast Florida.<span>  The help that came to mind was <b><i>parent
resource center and autism outreach program</i></b>.  A Parent Resource Center to get them the support,
training and advocacy that will help </span>their children reach their
full potential, successfully transition into life and sustain employment. </p>
<p>That
thought inspired Carrence Bass, the mother of a
child with autism and Christian McNeill, a dedicated autism advocate, to start the
Making Strides For Autism parent resource center,<span>  Since inception, I’ve had </span>one heart-felt wish – may families have an easier time than I
did obtaining the services and support needed to raise their children.</p>
<p>Over
the last four years I’ve worked with parents, Autism Speaks, providers and currently the City of Jacksonville and UF CARD. So I am dedicated and passionate about 1) Opening
the Making Strides For Autism parent resource center 2) removing the stigma of
autism and 3) getting kids help early, when it can do the most good.</p>
<p>That’s
why I need your support. Because the autism parents in Northeast Florida need
our support.<span>  People need to know that
the special gifts which come with Autism are an asset—not a burden—to society.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Campaign<br/>
</h3>
<p><span><span>Making Strides For Autism need your support to make the Making Strides For Autism parent resource center a reality. This center will be the first Northeast Florida Autism Community Parent Resource Center. Our center will assist families who have children with autism.  Our vision is that all ASD families will have universal access to information, training, support, and advocacy skills to help their children reach their full potential.  We will open our center and outreach program in January 2017.  <span><span>Making Strides For Autism has applied for our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status with the IRS.  All donations made while in our pending status are tax deductible. </span></span>We're currently  working hard to build lasting and cohesive community and national partnerships  that will assist the ASD families in Northeast Florida.  </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Making Strides For Autism has been invited to be 1 of 35 One Spark creator applicants to participate in The Spark Walk Idea Market at the Jacksonville Landing. An opportunity for us to gain exposure and crowdfund to launch the upcoming parent resource center.  We hope to raise all of the money for our campaign but we believe that this initiative will also help to raise awareness about Making Strides for Autism and the need to help parents of children with autism spectrum disorders living in Northeast Florida. Please support us by sharing our cause on social media, on your websites, with friends, family and employers and by donating on Indiegogo. No amount is too small. From small steps to making strides; every donation helps!</span></span></p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Need</b></p>
<p>Making Strides For Autism has a special niche, and—in its two
divisions—meets a critical need.</p>
<p>One in 68 children is diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorders.  (1 in 48 are boys and 1 in
189 are girls). Out of these 56% won’t graduate from high school.  Due to the lack of social and/or life skills 85%
will be unemployed.  This cost taxpayers
236 Billion a year.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile due to the sometimes demanding needs, this also
causes high attrition rates, unproductive work hours and a lack of secondary
education participation from parents with children who have ASD.</p>
<p>But
statistics doesn’t get to the heart of what we do…</p>
<p><b>The Mission</b></p>
<p>Making
Strides For Autism <span>is dedicated to helping parents
become better prepared to meet the needs of their children with support,
training, and advocacy.<span>  We go above and
beyond to provide the tools and resource connections</span></span> needed to assist their children to
lead successful and productive lives.<span>  Our Autism Outreach program will assist
children and adults with ASD from age 8 through 26, with the essential items
they need to thrive, transition into adulthood, gain and sustain employment and
succeed in life.  Starting with fun year round
inclusion activities based on their strengths and skill sets that we cultivate
to help them transition into sustainable employment. Our services and programs are
provided free of charge or at very low cost by engaging and connecting a
coalition of Northeast Florida community partners to create a village to raise
children on the spectrum and help parents and adults on the spectrum.  Making Strides For Autism’s goal is to supplement
current projects and/or programs already established in the community and
initiate and/or create innovative new initiatives to fulfill the unmet needs in
the autism community.</span></p>

Donor support of the autism center will go directly toward providing the
necessary personnel and resources to open the Making Strides For Autism Community Parent Resource Center and Autism Outreach Program for Northeast Florida. This fundraising effort is designed to meet the initial start-up
costs, for personnel, our parent resource website. This is the first of our crowdfunding campaigns.  Our long-term goal is to be self-supporting or break even in
subsequent years. <span><span>This campaign will consist of
donations to our crowdfunding campaign, corporate donations,
selling Making Strides For Autism retail merchandise and grassroots community events. </span></span><p><span><span></span></span><span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span></p><p><b>The Model</b></p>

Once our center is opened Making Strides For Autism will be funded through merchandise
sales, grants, grassroots community drives and corporate donations. Making
Strides For Autism employs parents and/or family members with children on the
autism spectrum and people with autism spectrum disorders.<span>  Making Strides For Autism will offer a New
Autism Friendly Certification that is a joint project collaborated UF Health
Center For Autism &amp; Related Disabilities for businesses in Northeast
Florida.  This certification will provide
in-depth training on being an autism friendly business for patrons, employees that
have children on the spectrum and employing people with autism.  <br/></span><p></p>
<p><span><span><span>Businesses that complete this certification will
be able to use the</span></span></span><span><span>
<span>Making Strides For Autism Logo on their websites, social
media and marketing material to signify they are an autism friendly business to
the community.  These businesses will
also be listed on our resource database website that we will launch in January
2017 that families and people with ASD can do customized searches to locate
resources if they are not able to come into our center.  Services and programs are facilitated through
our professionally trained staff and contractors and our collaborative network
of social service agencies and school partners.</span></span></span></p>

<p></p></div>","A Little Background





You may not realize it, but autism has probably touched the life of somebody
you know. Better yet, imagine receiving an autism diagnosis for your child.
What would you do? Who would you turn to for help and support? What about when they grow up; who will hire them?  How will they receive the skills needed to reach their full potential?  Early
identification, intensive therapy and transition services typically help these children and their
families overcome the educational challenges presented by autism, but this has
proven an overwhelming task for our autism resource providers in Northeast Florida to
undertake alone.
That’s where the Making Strides For Autism Parent Resource Center and Autism Youth Project come in.  Families are faced with fear, uncertainty,
and in many cases the feeling of being completely alone. We need YOUR
help to give parents of children with autism the parent to parent support they
need through support, training and advocacy programs. As well as assessing youth with autism's strengths and transition those strengths into a career which will allow them to live as independently as possible. 

Our Story


As a mother of a son
on the autism spectrum, I asked myself recently what is that I can do that will
help fellow autism parents the most as they start their autism journey. What do
we need the most that is not offered in Northeast Florida.  The help that came to mind was parent
resource center and autism outreach program.  A Parent Resource Center to get them the support,
training and advocacy that will help their children reach their
full potential, successfully transition into life and sustain employment. 
That
thought inspired Carrence Bass, the mother of a
child with autism and Christian McNeill, a dedicated autism advocate, to start the
Making Strides For Autism parent resource center,  Since inception, I’ve had one heart-felt wish – may families have an easier time than I
did obtaining the services and support needed to raise their children.
Over
the last four years I’ve worked with parents, Autism Speaks, providers and currently the City of Jacksonville and UF CARD. So I am dedicated and passionate about 1) Opening
the Making Strides For Autism parent resource center 2) removing the stigma of
autism and 3) getting kids help early, when it can do the most good.
That’s
why I need your support. Because the autism parents in Northeast Florida need
our support.  People need to know that
the special gifts which come with Autism are an asset—not a burden—to society.


Our Campaign

Making Strides For Autism need your support to make the Making Strides For Autism parent resource center a reality. This center will be the first Northeast Florida Autism Community Parent Resource Center. Our center will assist families who have children with autism.  Our vision is that all ASD families will have universal access to information, training, support, and advocacy skills to help their children reach their full potential.  We will open our center and outreach program in January 2017.  Making Strides For Autism has applied for our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status with the IRS.  All donations made while in our pending status are tax deductible. We're currently  working hard to build lasting and cohesive community and national partnerships  that will assist the ASD families in Northeast Florida.  
Making Strides For Autism has been invited to be 1 of 35 One Spark creator applicants to participate in The Spark Walk Idea Market at the Jacksonville Landing. An opportunity for us to gain exposure and crowdfund to launch the upcoming parent resource center.  We hope to raise all of the money for our campaign but we believe that this initiative will also help to raise awareness about Making Strides for Autism and the need to help parents of children with autism spectrum disorders living in Northeast Florida. Please support us by sharing our cause on social media, on your websites, with friends, family and employers and by donating on Indiegogo. No amount is too small. From small steps to making strides; every donation helps!

   What We Need & What You Get



The Need
Making Strides For Autism has a special niche, and—in its two
divisions—meets a critical need.
One in 68 children is diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorders.  (1 in 48 are boys and 1 in
189 are girls). Out of these 56% won’t graduate from high school.  Due to the lack of social and/or life skills 85%
will be unemployed.  This cost taxpayers
236 Billion a year.  
Meanwhile due to the sometimes demanding needs, this also
causes high attrition rates, unproductive work hours and a lack of secondary
education participation from parents with children who have ASD.
But
statistics doesn’t get to the heart of what we do…
The Mission
Making
Strides For Autism is dedicated to helping parents
become better prepared to meet the needs of their children with support,
training, and advocacy.  We go above and
beyond to provide the tools and resource connections needed to assist their children to
lead successful and productive lives.  Our Autism Outreach program will assist
children and adults with ASD from age 8 through 26, with the essential items
they need to thrive, transition into adulthood, gain and sustain employment and
succeed in life.  Starting with fun year round
inclusion activities based on their strengths and skill sets that we cultivate
to help them transition into sustainable employment. Our services and programs are
provided free of charge or at very low cost by engaging and connecting a
coalition of Northeast Florida community partners to create a village to raise
children on the spectrum and help parents and adults on the spectrum.  Making Strides For Autism’s goal is to supplement
current projects and/or programs already established in the community and
initiate and/or create innovative new initiatives to fulfill the unmet needs in
the autism community.

Donor support of the autism center will go directly toward providing the
necessary personnel and resources to open the Making Strides For Autism Community Parent Resource Center and Autism Outreach Program for Northeast Florida. This fundraising effort is designed to meet the initial start-up
costs, for personnel, our parent resource website. This is the first of our crowdfunding campaigns.  Our long-term goal is to be self-supporting or break even in
subsequent years. This campaign will consist of
donations to our crowdfunding campaign, corporate donations,
selling Making Strides For Autism retail merchandise and grassroots community events. 
The Model

Once our center is opened Making Strides For Autism will be funded through merchandise
sales, grants, grassroots community drives and corporate donations. Making
Strides For Autism employs parents and/or family members with children on the
autism spectrum and people with autism spectrum disorders.  Making Strides For Autism will offer a New
Autism Friendly Certification that is a joint project collaborated UF Health
Center For Autism & Related Disabilities for businesses in Northeast
Florida.  This certification will provide
in-depth training on being an autism friendly business for patrons, employees that
have children on the spectrum and employing people with autism.  
Businesses that complete this certification will
be able to use the
Making Strides For Autism Logo on their websites, social
media and marketing material to signify they are an autism friendly business to
the community.  These businesses will
also be listed on our resource database website that we will launch in January
2017 that families and people with ASD can do customized searches to locate
resources if they are not able to come into our center.  Services and programs are facilitated through
our professionally trained staff and contractors and our collaborative network
of social service agencies and school partners.
More On Our Campaign
We’ll
need to reach $50,000 to commission phase one. Please help us in being
a champion for our cause by donating, liking, sharing, and spreading the word so
that we can help to make it a little easier for our families facing autism journeys.  But
that’s not where we want to stop!

Wooden furniture, wooden doors, windows and other wood interior designs are commonplace in almost every home and office. The natural ambiance of wood products makes it a premier choice.

<li>Wood is a truly renewable resource that is grown by the sun. In sustainable   forests if forests are cut down to harvest wood new trees are planted to   renew the resource for the long term</li>
<li>Wood is a durable material that can last for generations</li>
<li>Wood enhances our surroundings by bringing warmth, spirituality, and connection to mother nature into our living spaces</li>
<li>Wood is versatile enabling us to maintain traditional looks, or create modern   sleek designs with our products.</li>
</ul><p>Life cycle analysis and scientific studies have shown that using renewable resources such as wood helps the environment over the long term when compared to other materials, and compared to wood that is not sourced from sustainably managed forests.</p><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473155101/ovqdcpbximfylymfdi1j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h4>Frequently Asked Questions:</h4><p><b>How do I wash the cup?

Our StoryWe are a small team of 4 people and our dream project has passed the conceptual stage. We've designed, developed, engineered, and rigorously tested a batch of all our products, sucessfully over the period of 2 years. This has been a ton of work, costly, and time consuming, but now that it's all completed, we are sure, we can deliver top quality products on time.  Why Use Sustainable Wood?We have a love affair with wood. Wooden furniture, wooden doors, windows and other wood interior designs are commonplace in almost every home and office. The natural ambiance of wood products makes it a premier choice. From the time of the Aboriginal people till today.There are several reasons why wood remains the natural choice.
Wood is a truly renewable resource that is grown by the sun. In sustainable   forests if forests are cut down to harvest wood new trees are planted to   renew the resource for the long term
Wood is a durable material that can last for generations
Wood enhances our surroundings by bringing warmth, spirituality, and connection to mother nature into our living spaces
Wood is versatile enabling us to maintain traditional looks, or create modern   sleek designs with our products.
Life cycle analysis and scientific studies have shown that using renewable resources such as wood helps the environment over the long term when compared to other materials, and compared to wood that is not sourced from sustainably managed forests.  Frequently Asked Questions:How do I wash the cup? Wouldn’t water affect the wood?Your barrel mug is completely sealed and requires no special care. Wash it by hand with mild soap and warm water. Do not let your mugsoak in water.NEVER PUT YOUR MUG IN THE DISHWASHER OR MICROWAVE OVEN!Is it safe to drink out of it?Yes, it is safe to drink out of the barrel mugs. Each mug has passed our health and safety standards. It has a water-based food safe coating that makes the mug completely resistant to anything that you can survive drinking.How durable is it? How long will it last?Each mug is handcrafted from European White Oak which is known for its durability and strength. Show the mug some love and care and it will be your companion for life.When and how do I choose my mug shape, stainless steel cup and engraving?Indiegogo does not allow you to select your mug shape and specifications upfront, but you will receive an email within a week of your order that will allow you to pick your shape (with or without the stainless steel cup) and your engraving (from our bank of designs or a personalised one). How do I send my logo for engraving?Within a week of your order we will send you an email asking you to select your barrel mug and its specification. Select the engraving option in the survey and send us your design or logo in an email to @woodtrim in these vector formats(.ai, .eps .cdr) We also have a large bank of design to choose from in case you can’t make up your mind on a design.Can I sell your product?Of course you can, drop us and email at support@woodtrim.in and we’re sure we can work something out.Cheers!",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><u><strong>Short Summary</strong></u></p>
<p>Hi! Hopefully you’ve already watched our campaign video so we can skip past the “I’m Annie” and “I’m Luke” part. But in all honesty, we want to give you a little insight into who we are and what we’re up to:</p> <p>Both born and raised in Columbus OH, each with a little time elsewhere (Chicago and Houston, respectively), we have spent a combined 30 years working in the food/beverage/hospitality industry. We have served Columbus at some of the top establishments, been a part of countless restaurant and bar openings, and trained bartenders and servers across the city. We have proudly come to the realization that this is our path and our profession, and we had better start working for ourselves!</p> <p>So what is Law Bird? In short it’s our dream for both ourselves and the hungry (thirsty) and passionate consumers here in Columbus. We’ve been joking that we are opening our dream bar that we’ll never get to visit, and while that’s partly true, it’s not for us, it’s for YOU. We are working to create an exceptional space for our guests to come try new things, find unique favorites, and genuinely enjoy the curated selection of wine, cocktails, and small plates we have put together.</p> <p>Why are we doing an Indiegogo Campaign? For us, this is the difference between being truly able to execute our vision and having to make unwanted quality based sacrifices. Like we said in the video: “It’s not necessarily about the finer things, but the right things”. So we’re not talking about picking $18/sf tile (although it was gorgeous!) but more along the lines of bringing all the details together and creating a cohesive and beautiful experience for you.</p> <p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>We are here to raise $30,000. Some of that money is going to go to a little bit of everything: the padding and upholstery on the back of the bench seats, barstools, the actual bar itself. We are working to do this the right way, and in some areas that means doing a lot ourselves (making the table tops, painting the space), but there are definitely things we are leaving to the professionals (you know like plumbing, electrical, building walls). But it is also going to pay for changes required by the city. We've already been handed one $10k To-Do list from the City of Columbus and because we want to have more than 40 of you in the bar at a time, and we want to be able to use our basement for storage, we forked it all over. All in all, there are things we know will happen, that we have planned for. It's the unknown that we don't know about!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What’s in it for you? Well, while we are working to make the space incredible for everyone, we want to make sure that we offer some EXTRA amazing perks for those of you who help make it happen. Yes, this includes swag, but more importantly we wanted to offer personally curated experiences as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of our mottos is that we serve people, not cocktails, and what this means to us is that we are here to serve  YOU, not just whatever we’re putting in a glass for you. Want to learn more about any beverage related topic (fermentation 101, what is mezcal?, what is this new “orange wine” category?, what makes Japanese whisky so special?) - then pick the “Up Close &amp; Personal” perk and we will work create a two hour master class for you and three friends on the topic of your choosing. We want to get to know you better, so that we may serve you better.</p> <p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>Why this and why here? Columbus is primed for new and exciting concepts made FOR Columbus residents BY Columbus residents. We are truly excited to be a part of the South High strip of the Brewery District, adding to the incredible other local businesses there that we LOVE (Antiques On High, Ambrose &amp; Eve, Smoked On High, Daily Growler, ect). We know that Law Bird will round out the offering in the area, wholly complimenting the other businesses, as well as help to create a new destination district within Columbus. </p>
<p>Why wine, cocktails, and snacks? Because we're crazy about them and we're pretty sure you are too! In short, these are the things that we love and we believe that we can offer an experience unlike any that exists in Columbus.<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>We know that not everyone has the ability to donate, and that’s ok! What we do ask is that you share your excitement, our story, our video, and our campaign.

Hi! Hopefully you’ve already watched our campaign video so we can skip past the “I’m Annie” and “I’m Luke” part. But in all honesty, we want to give you a little insight into who we are and what we’re up to: Both born and raised in Columbus OH, each with a little time elsewhere (Chicago and Houston, respectively), we have spent a combined 30 years working in the food/beverage/hospitality industry. We have served Columbus at some of the top establishments, been a part of countless restaurant and bar openings, and trained bartenders and servers across the city. We have proudly come to the realization that this is our path and our profession, and we had better start working for ourselves! So what is Law Bird? In short it’s our dream for both ourselves and the hungry (thirsty) and passionate consumers here in Columbus. We’ve been joking that we are opening our dream bar that we’ll never get to visit, and while that’s partly true, it’s not for us, it’s for YOU. We are working to create an exceptional space for our guests to come try new things, find unique favorites, and genuinely enjoy the curated selection of wine, cocktails, and small plates we have put together. Why are we doing an Indiegogo Campaign? For us, this is the difference between being truly able to execute our vision and having to make unwanted quality based sacrifices. Like we said in the video: “It’s not necessarily about the finer things, but the right things”. So we’re not talking about picking $18/sf tile (although it was gorgeous!) but more along the lines of bringing all the details together and creating a cohesive and beautiful experience for you. What We Need & What You Get
We are here to raise $30,000. Some of that money is going to go to a little bit of everything: the padding and upholstery on the back of the bench seats, barstools, the actual bar itself. We are working to do this the right way, and in some areas that means doing a lot ourselves (making the table tops, painting the space), but there are definitely things we are leaving to the professionals (you know like plumbing, electrical, building walls). But it is also going to pay for changes required by the city. We've already been handed one $10k To-Do list from the City of Columbus and because we want to have more than 40 of you in the bar at a time, and we want to be able to use our basement for storage, we forked it all over. All in all, there are things we know will happen, that we have planned for. It's the unknown that we don't know about!
 
What’s in it for you? Well, while we are working to make the space incredible for everyone, we want to make sure that we offer some EXTRA amazing perks for those of you who help make it happen. Yes, this includes swag, but more importantly we wanted to offer personally curated experiences as well.
 
One of our mottos is that we serve people, not cocktails, and what this means to us is that we are here to serve  YOU, not just whatever we’re putting in a glass for you. Want to learn more about any beverage related topic (fermentation 101, what is mezcal?, what is this new “orange wine” category?, what makes Japanese whisky so special?) - then pick the “Up Close & Personal” perk and we will work create a two hour master class for you and three friends on the topic of your choosing. We want to get to know you better, so that we may serve you better. The Impact
Why this and why here? Columbus is primed for new and exciting concepts made FOR Columbus residents BY Columbus residents. We are truly excited to be a part of the South High strip of the Brewery District, adding to the incredible other local businesses there that we LOVE (Antiques On High, Ambrose & Eve, Smoked On High, Daily Growler, ect). We know that Law Bird will round out the offering in the area, wholly complimenting the other businesses, as well as help to create a new destination district within Columbus. 
Why wine, cocktails, and snacks? Because we're crazy about them and we're pretty sure you are too! In short, these are the things that we love and we believe that we can offer an experience unlike any that exists in Columbus. 
Other Ways You Can Help
We know that not everyone has the ability to donate, and that’s ok! What we do ask is that you share your excitement, our story, our video, and our campaign. Help us spread the word, which will only help spread the love too! Also, if you’re not already, follow along on Instagram @LawBirdBar for all sorts of updates and sneak peeks!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our cabin is 90% finished and nearly ready for guest to enjoy our private little paradise. However, there are a few things we need your help and support with so we're offering pre-bookings in order to keep the ball rolling and open our doors sooner for you guys!</p>
<p>We will be offering pre-booking subject to availability. <strong>Please contact us first via instagram</strong> and let us know which dates you require before proceeding with any contributions.</p>
<h3><strong>About US</strong></h3>
<p>Just a <strong>2 min </strong>walk from the glistening Enchanted River and within a <strong>10 minute</strong> walk of the famous Cambugahay Falls, our cabin offers a naturally-built bamboo retreat for those looking for something unique.</p>
<p>With no immediate neighbors, the cabin provides a relaxed, rustic and utterly private space to enjoy the mindfulness of the stunning surroundings, while offering convenient access to some of Siquijor’s most beautiful attractions and some of the island’s best kept secrets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wifi ✔</p>
<p>Hot water ✔</p>
<p>Private landscape garden ✔</p>
<p>Outdoor cinema✔</p>
<p>Fire/BBQ Pit ✔</p>
<p>Indoor cooking facilities ✔</p>

<p>King size bed ✔</p>
<p>Garden lounging areas ✔</p>
<p>Jungle shower✔</p>
<p>Neighboring Enchanted river ✔</p>
<p>Recycling facilities  ✔</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The cabin is in a small valley and you have to walk down a small hill to reach the entrance. <strong>The entrance itself is about 70m from the road with a 25m decline to get down to the house.  </strong>For most people this won't be an issue but we would like to mention it for those who may be physically unfit or elderly may prefer somewhere with easier access. </p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>During your stay you will be met by our local host, who will show you the property. The host lives nearby if any problems arise but please remember we're not a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Neighbourhood </strong></p>
<p>Situated in the hillside just 1km north of Lazi town centre, guests can relax in the landscape garden, prepare fresh seafood or vegan food from the local vegetable market or use the rope-swing at the nearby enchanted river.  </p>
<p>It is a short <strong>3 minute </strong>scooter ride to the local town. Where you can find all the amenities you need. A <strong>10-15 minute</strong> riverside walk will lead you to one of the island’s most beautiful attractions, Cambugahay Falls with its cool mountain spring water and turquoise-coloured pools.</p>
<p>Lazi itself is a quaint little town, largely unaffected by tourism. Home to the national heritage site ✞ San Isidro Church and Convent ✞ along with some interesting local architecture, Lazi has heaps of character and photo opportunities. Bakeries and the local wet market sell fresh bread and local produce daily, while cute little cafes offer up freshly brewed coffee, shakes and local dishes along with some western comfort foods too.</p>
<p>For the more adventurous traveler, underwater caves, hidden pools, rice paddies and local farming communities are abundantly dotted around the surrounding area and while some are signposted others, you'll have to discover yourself - ideal for those who like to explore.</p>
<p><strong>Getting around </strong></p>
<p>While staying at the cabin, we recommend that our guests consider renting a scooter to get around the surrounding valleys and coastal roads. </p>
<p>Outside of Lazi itself, a 20 minute ride east will take you to some of the island’s most hidden beaches, mahogany forests and the super photogenic Salagdoong cliff diving spot.</p>
<p>30-40 minutes west, meanwhile, will lead you to the beachfront town of San Juan for white sandy beaches and great fresh, local eats.</p>
<p><strong>Getting here</strong></p>
<p>For international travelers we recommend that you fly into Dumaguete airport (which involves a transit in Manila) and then get the fast craft to Siquijor island.</p>
<p>To get from the airport to the ferry you can either take a taxi or a tricycle which takes about 10 mins (fair should be 150-200PHP). There are numourous ferries that run between Dumaguete &amp; Siquijor but please let us know what time your flight arrives so we can advise.</p>
<p>Once on the island, renting a scooter is easy and by far the best way to get around.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our house is complete with electric, running water and most importantly, a good internet connection! Here's what we have left to complete</p>
<ul>
<li>Our garden is 70% finished but we need to finish the fence and add some finishing touches</li>
<li>Our cinema areas has a screen (and projector) but no sand and seating just yet. </li>
<li>We need to make a bed and add homely elements to our sleeping space.</li>
<li>Our kitchen is done but needs all those final finishing touches</li>
<li>Our entrance is accessible but we're making a path for a scooter and need to add lights. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your contribution and pre-bookings we can help to complete our goals and open our doors to you wonderfully adventurous people. We've worked so hard on making something special and we need your help to make our dreams come to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Our challenges are small and mostly to do with time . We would love to see our space occupied and with so much interest online would like to offer potential guest a way of pre-booking in exchange for a little helping hand in the funding department.</p>
<p>Realistically, we believe that we can open doors on the the 8th of February </p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>As of 03/16/2020, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors ordered the temporary closure of all restaurants and bars until 03/31/20. In considering the risks involved for our staff and their families, we have decided not to open for takeout or deliveries.<br/><br/>Our intention at Tahona Mezcaleria is to be a place of communion around one of the most misunderstood spirits. In the past year and a half since opening, we have become a staple of the Old Town community and have been blessed with amazing support from San Diegans. <br/><br/>None of what we have accomplished at Tahona would have been possible without the hard work of our employees. Our team's motto is to make everyone feel at home when they walk through our doors. Tahona's mission to educate and empower mezcal producers would not be possible without the daily commitment towards excellence by every single one of our team members.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, this abrupt restaurant closure places our entire staff in a hard situation. We are not sure how much time will pass before we can reopen, and in the meantime there is no alternative work for which they can apply.<br/><br/>This is why we are starting this campaign to raise funds to support our team. We're in this together and with your support, we will prevail!</p>
<p><strong>Here's how you can support us during these tough times:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Buy one of our designer T’s:</strong> we’ve partnered with a local business to produce these t-shirts on demand based on your purchase, thus supporting them in the process. We will donate 100% of the proceeds of t-shirt sales to our staff.</p>
<p>- <strong>Purchase a pre-sale of a Mezcal &amp; Tacos tasting experience:</strong> upon the re-opening of Tahona Mezcaleria, you will be able to call to book your spot to enjoy this incredible experience! Again, 100% of proceeds from the sale of these tasting experiences will be donated to our staff.</p>
<p>We hope to see all of you very soon to cheer to our health and a better future!</p>

<br/>What is KIAA about?</h2><p>KIAA should be your first port of call if you find yourself asking the following questions:</p><ul>
<li>I want to host a sushi making party. Where do I start?</li>
<li>Where can I get sushi quality fish and seafood?</li>

We will look at what is required to get us there in the next section.</p><h2>
<br/>Rewards!</h2><p>Before we dive into the nitty gritty, let's take a look at some of the exciting perks that we have planned for you.</p><p><i><strong>For you to impress</strong></i></p><p>We will be offering various cookery classes from a fermentation workshop and knife training, to full on sushi preparation and Japanese cooking. We aim to give you everything you need to know to reproduce the results at home. Impress your guests with your new found skills!</p><p><i><strong>For you to indulge</strong></i></p><p>Also on offer are a few special treats from the Umezushi restaurant itself, including meals, seafood feast, and an one off special kaiseki menu. They are for pure indulgence.</p><p><i><strong>For the exclusivity</strong></i></p><p>There is a small number of very special perks that we offer in this campaign, including standing reservation at Umezushi and VIP cards. They really show off your obsession in us.</p><p>You can find further details in the perks section (on the right hand side, we believe?) of this campaign. Everything will be explained in detail there!</p><p> </p><h2>Finance</h2><p>This is the slightly scary section - finance! The KIAA project involves building up a 110m^2 empty shell unit and filling it with equipment and stock. The estimated cost of the project is in the region of £110,000. We have secured funding of £50,000 from Umezushi itself, friends, and other investors, and this funding will allow us to complete the building work. We are hoping to raise the missing £60,000 (net) from this campaign, which will allow us to purchase cooking and refrigeration equipment. The detailed plan is in the appendix part of this campaign.</p><p> </p><h2>How Will This Campaign Help?</h2><p>As we already mentioned earlier, this campaign is to help us purchasing the equipment required for KIAA. This new equipment have four goals:</p><ul>
<li>Increase production capacity.</li>
<li>Improve quality.</li>
<li>Improve consistency.</li>
<li>Even better food safety.</li>
</ul><p>The campaigned amount will allow us to produce and store everything at the optimal level that we planned to do. Each contribution will take us a step closer to that. You will find a list of equipment that we intend to purchase in Appendix II.</p><p>Below is just a short video about the building work.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzyx-JNVqDA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>Any project and investment comes with risks, known or unknown. We have identified three major risks of our project below.</p><p><i><strong>Delays!!!</strong></i></p><p>It seems that most building works are done in a different universe. An universe that time runs at different (slower) speed. During our planning, we try to bring it back down to earth and give everything a reasonable target with a good contingency. We will also pay extra attention in supervising the building work. The site is just opposite to Umezushi, so we have no excuse...</p><p><i><strong>What if we don't meet our campaign target?</strong></i></p><p>This is a genuine concern for us. Firstly, we will probably have a serious conversation with ourselves in front of the mirror. We have never done crowdfunding before and anything could happen. Although, we are optimistic about our target, we need to be realistic. We have plan B, and plan C in place incase we cannot reach our target in one step. We have an incremental implementation of our plan. The keystone of the project is the completion of the initial building work, which we have planned, budgeted, and funded. We will adjust our service and product offering according to what equipment we are able to purchase based on the final contribution.</p><p><i><strong>What if KIAA does not take off?</strong></i></p><p>This is actually one problem that we worry about the least. After some furious clicking on the calculator, we worked out that the running cost of KIAA can already be covered by Umezushi. What it means is that even if we have no customers in KIAA, we will still be able to offer better quality food prepared in a safer environment and larger capacity, just with less profit. So, the 12 strong at Umezushi have all agreed to eat less during their lunch break to make up for the difference!</p><p>As for the unknown risks? well... we will just cross our fingers and hope for the best and see what lemon the world throws at us.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Nothing takes your fancy but the altruistic you is screaming to come out? Get in touch! We love new ideas and any help we can get is greatly appreciated! </p><p> </p><h2>Appendix I - The Building Plan</h2><p>The current site is a shell unit with a toilet and kitchenette and the plan is to put in these features:</p><ul>
<li>mezzanine floor for offices and staff room</li>
<li>chilled wine cellar</li>
<li>cold prep kitchen</li>
<li>hot prep kitchen</li>
<li>store front</li>

It is very straight forward, like a matchbox inside a tunnel. How hard can it be?</p><p> </p><h2>Appendix II - Equipment List</h2><p>Below is a list of equipment that we plan to install in KIAA:</p><ul>
<li>-65C walk in freezer</li>
<li>walk in fridge</li>
<li>high power blast freezer</li>
<li>thawing chamber</li>
<li>filleting sink station</li>

We have secured funding of £50,000 from Umezushi itself, friends, and other investors, and this funding will allow us to complete the building work. We are hoping to raise the missing £60,000 (net) from this campaign, which will allow us to purchase cooking and refrigeration equipment. The detailed plan is in the appendix part of this campaign. How Will This Campaign Help?As we already mentioned earlier, this campaign is to help us purchasing the equipment required for KIAA. This new equipment have four goals:
Increase production capacity.
Improve quality.
Improve consistency.
Even better food safety.
The campaigned amount will allow us to produce and store everything at the optimal level that we planned to do. Each contribution will take us a step closer to that. You will find a list of equipment that we intend to purchase in Appendix II.Below is just a short video about the building work.Risks & ChallengesAny project and investment comes with risks, known or unknown. We have identified three major risks of our project below.Delays!!!It seems that most building works are done in a different universe. An universe that time runs at different (slower) speed. During our planning, we try to bring it back down to earth and give everything a reasonable target with a good contingency. We will also pay extra attention in supervising the building work. The site is just opposite to Umezushi, so we have no excuse...What if we don't meet our campaign target?This is a genuine concern for us. Firstly, we will probably have a serious conversation with ourselves in front of the mirror. We have never done crowdfunding before and anything could happen. Although, we are optimistic about our target, we need to be realistic. We have plan B, and plan C in place incase we cannot reach our target in one step. We have an incremental implementation of our plan. The keystone of the project is the completion of the initial building work, which we have planned, budgeted, and funded. We will adjust our service and product offering according to what equipment we are able to purchase based on the final contribution.What if KIAA does not take off?This is actually one problem that we worry about the least. After some furious clicking on the calculator, we worked out that the running cost of KIAA can already be covered by Umezushi. What it means is that even if we have no customers in KIAA, we will still be able to offer better quality food prepared in a safer environment and larger capacity, just with less profit. So, the 12 strong at Umezushi have all agreed to eat less during their lunch break to make up for the difference!As for the unknown risks? well... we will just cross our fingers and hope for the best and see what lemon the world throws at us. Other Ways You Can HelpNothing takes your fancy but the altruistic you is screaming to come out? Get in touch! We love new ideas and any help we can get is greatly appreciated!  Appendix I - The Building PlanThe current site is a shell unit with a toilet and kitchenette and the plan is to put in these features:
mezzanine floor for offices and staff room
chilled wine cellar
cold prep kitchen
hot prep kitchen
store front
You can find the plan at this LINK. It is very straight forward, like a matchbox inside a tunnel. How hard can it be? Appendix II - Equipment ListBelow is a list of equipment that we plan to install in KIAA:

<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>Members of the <strong>International Churches of Christ (ICOC)</strong> community travel all around the world for many reasons. Often times a barrier to traveling is the high cost of overnight accommodations.</p>
<p>Members attempt to find other members in sister churches around the world to coordinate overnight housing. They desire to <strong>connect</strong> with other Christians for <strong>mutual encouragement</strong> and to <strong>save </strong>a few dollars along the way. This <strong>pursuit can be challenging when</strong>:  </p>
<ul>
<li>They don't know anyone personally where they are going</li>
<li>Members they knew in the city have since moved away </li>
<li>They feel awkward contacting local ministry leaders listed on the church's website to see if a host can be found</li>
<li>The list can go on and on...</li>
</ul>
<p>The very <strong>fiber </strong>of the ICOC community is <strong>love</strong>, <strong>relationships</strong>, and <strong>hospitality</strong>. For years, disciples in the church have demonstrated their love by hosting others as an expression of Christian faith. They have seen a need and answered the call, with open doors and open hearts.  They have freely shared with others out of what has been given to them.  </p>

I'm opening a bike shop in the Historic La Buena building on 22nd St and S 4th Ave which will also be the home of Monsoon Chocolate, a gourmet chocolate maker that will also serve food and coffee. This area is in the beginning stages of revitalization and a prime location for a bike shop. Less than two miles from downtown with views of A-Mountain. There's Starr Pass resort and the Tucson Mountain Park on the west with miles and miles of mountain bike trails and El Tour De Tucson starts just up the street and passes by the shop. I have extensive knowledge with all makes and models, high end, low end and everything in between and experience managing and sale. I have also made dealer agreements with Ellsworth Handcrafted Bicycles, Voodoo Cycles and State Bicycles, I'll be offering professional bike repair, bikes sales, parts, accessories and much more. I take pride in my work and make it a point to always keep learning. I'm a Shimano certified technician and a member of the Professional Bicycle Mechanics Association (PBMA) and have been an on-site mechanic for Outside Magazine's annual bike test. I've been ready to open my own bike shop for a very long time and the time is now. I'm really reaching for the American dream here, building something out of nothing.

<p>We are a tight-knit family company with family-centric ideals.  The impact that media has on culture, especially on developing youth, inspired my amazing mother, Alicia Hamilton (also known as Lady A) to create a place to share positive, informative, and inspirational media with like minded families and friends. My mother has a background in communications and technology, and has been serving in ministry alongside her husband Pastor Alexander Hamilton over twenty years.  Over time, the issues that were occurring in the community became more global in scope.  So, Lady A started building a platform to reach the world with messages of love, peace, truth and wisdom.  </p>

<p>My mother is very salient to how media is influencing culture in my generation. Upon my visit home from Argentina where I was studying Psychology and Spanish, my mother convinced me to stay and partner with her to bring a new age spin to her vision. With my charismatic personality and strategic intellect and her wisdom and experience, together we are hoping to build and strengthen the network. With your support we can spread our message to more like minded individuals and achieve our goals of creating a positive and conscious media platform to positively affect social change.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475628949/almwg6rbwezjbms8e4qg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Citizen journalists and citizen producers are rising in numbers and telling the stories that are relative to their communities. Universal Citizens is a gathering place for bringing purposeful programming to uplift and educate communities while also entertaining them.</p> <p>We believe that we can be the change we want to see in the world and the Universal Citizens Media Network platform is a means to make that contribution through media.  This is why your help is incredibly important to us. The paradigm shift is happening now and we seek to be part of the movement that gives strength to the individual and empowers community.</p> <p>We know that media has the power to control the masses. Due to concerns of the strong impact that negative media has on culture, The Universal Citizens Media Network was created to provide an option for families to get programs with purposeful, conscientious themes. We are just beginning to see how violence, degradation, and the oppression portrayed in media have affected this generation.  The Universal Citizens Media family of contributors has all chosen to bring media that empowers, heals, and educates without the degrading and destructive images that have been placed in front of developing youth.</p>
<p>The advent of IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) technology has leveled the playing field in the media distribution game by providing a cost effective means for sharing media on a larger scale.  Small companies like ours are now on the playing field, and becoming serious competitors reaching mass audiences that were cost prohibitive prior to the Internet of things.  Audiences are also unplugging from traditional and more costly broadcast solutions like cable television.  IPTV provides options for audiences to get media that is less expensive, more engaging, interactive, over many devices, on demand and flexible for today’s busy lifestyles.  Television is not going away, but the market is being diluted by more options than ever before and advertisers are shifting spending to the IPTV digital networks thanks to trendsetting providers like; Google, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon, etc.   </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475626567/eq1uvupghi1a6affdj1g.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","Universal Citizens Media Network is a free streaming platform where you can have your voice heard on your own mobile channel and terrestrial broadcast station. 
Universal Citizens has a studio where you can film, edit, and take your video content to the next level. Whether you want the services of a camera crew to follow you around, edit your videos, or film you in the studio, we can help you create the kind of high quality content you want to match the quality of your message. Our studios are based in Orange County, California and with your support, we hope to expand our studios across the state and across the country to provide this premium service. 
Universal Citizens has the resources to place you in front of your target audience. Like Youtube, your content will be broadcasted and accessed on the internet. With Universal Citizens, your presence doesn’t end there. Our premium service would allow all of your video, audio recordings, music videos, documentaries, and other contents to be seen by more than just an internet audience. Alongside our online broadcasting, our 24/7 television broadcast places your content in front of our large niche audiences. 
Your voice is your legacy. Universal Citizens Media wants you to benefit from your message. We give the content creators the lion's share of the profits generated from the banner ads, promotional materials, and sponsorship revenue generated on our platform. 
The UC Media Network streams purposeful conscious media worldwide while providing services for creatives that seek resources to make professional high quality videos. Content streamed on our platform is contributed by a grassroots community of Indie Artists, Citizen Journalists, & Producers that want to make a positive impact on culture & social change. With your support, funding will fortify our position to create a platform where subscribers & content creators can have their voices heard.
 
We are a tight-knit family company with family-centric ideals.  The impact that media has on culture, especially on developing youth, inspired my amazing mother, Alicia Hamilton (also known as Lady A) to create a place to share positive, informative, and inspirational media with like minded families and friends. My mother has a background in communications and technology, and has been serving in ministry alongside her husband Pastor Alexander Hamilton over twenty years.  Over time, the issues that were occurring in the community became more global in scope.  So, Lady A started building a platform to reach the world with messages of love, peace, truth and wisdom.  
 

My mother is very salient to how media is influencing culture in my generation. Upon my visit home from Argentina where I was studying Psychology and Spanish, my mother convinced me to stay and partner with her to bring a new age spin to her vision. With my charismatic personality and strategic intellect and her wisdom and experience, together we are hoping to build and strengthen the network. With your support we can spread our message to more like minded individuals and achieve our goals of creating a positive and conscious media platform to positively affect social change. 
Citizen journalists and citizen producers are rising in numbers and telling the stories that are relative to their communities. Universal Citizens is a gathering place for bringing purposeful programming to uplift and educate communities while also entertaining them. We believe that we can be the change we want to see in the world and the Universal Citizens Media Network platform is a means to make that contribution through media.  This is why your help is incredibly important to us. The paradigm shift is happening now and we seek to be part of the movement that gives strength to the individual and empowers community. We know that media has the power to control the masses. Due to concerns of the strong impact that negative media has on culture, The Universal Citizens Media Network was created to provide an option for families to get programs with purposeful, conscientious themes. We are just beginning to see how violence, degradation, and the oppression portrayed in media have affected this generation.  The Universal Citizens Media family of contributors has all chosen to bring media that empowers, heals, and educates without the degrading and destructive images that have been placed in front of developing youth.
The advent of IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) technology has leveled the playing field in the media distribution game by providing a cost effective means for sharing media on a larger scale.  Small companies like ours are now on the playing field, and becoming serious competitors reaching mass audiences that were cost prohibitive prior to the Internet of things.  Audiences are also unplugging from traditional and more costly broadcast solutions like cable television.  IPTV provides options for audiences to get media that is less expensive, more engaging, interactive, over many devices, on demand and flexible for today’s busy lifestyles.  Television is not going away, but the market is being diluted by more options than ever before and advertisers are shifting spending to the IPTV digital networks thanks to trendsetting providers like; Google, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon, etc.    
We’ve been hard at work making this possible and have created several established websites (trn.tv and ucit.tv) and channels. Our mission is to consolidate them into one convenient umbrella site where you can steam and create content. We want you to hear your voice and the messages of others, in ways that vary from comedy, drama, faith-based, informative content and more. Watch and enjoy the positive content that we have on Universal Citizens Media. This website will be called UCmedia.net and will be available soon. 
Lady A often says, ""technology is the rocket ship but content is the fuel.” This rocket ship is in place, but we need to enhance the hardware and fuel to get to where we want to go. This will enable us to do the following: 

Create jobs: Our goal is to provide job opportunities for students and community members that will become our next producers, editors, technicians, engineers, channel managers, interns, and video crew members to help make every production successful!

Present New Types of Programs: We will bring many new programs to share including; DIY (Do It Yourself) segments, films from independent artist, documentaries, talk shows, scripted shows, music videos and compositions. These programs will feature all different themes and concepts, including topics most media sources purposely withhold.

Impacting the Community: Together we will make a positive impact on the world with media that is informative, entertaining, and fun. Below is a segment from one of upcoming shows, "" UC Now.""

 Our media platform is set; however we seek to deliver our programs with excellence. Our campaign goal of $50k is the initial phase one funding that will go toward shoring up the Universal Citizens Media Network platform for anticipated growth.  Funding will be distributed as noted in the graph below; equipment, hardware, software, team support, content licensing, initial promotions, and our studio lease. We will continue to embellish and improve our media and broadcast quality.  Every dollar we receive will help us to improve our capabilities.   
We value and appreciate all contributions to our efforts and have created some cool perks that we hope you will enjoy. Our goal is to acknowledge every contributor that decides to become a part of our movement forward!

Earlier this year we found the perfect farm in Glen Huon, on the banks of the beautiful Huon River, and now I need your help to create the best dairy farm in Australia and turn the dream into a reality.</p><p>The Huon Valley was once a vibrant dairy region and was once home to dozens of small dairies. Sadly, today, they are all gone – unable to compete against the huge low-cost dairy farms that are now the standard in Australia. This dairy farm (the first to open in the Huon Valley in over half a century) will prove that small-scale, quality dairy farming can be viable in this country.</p><p>As a small business, this is a huge step for us, but a vital one. Your support will go toward directly towards buying the cows and building the dairy – the two major costs in establishing the farm.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why we need your help &amp; What’s in it for you.</strong></p><p>In order to make this dream a reality, we need your support to first buy the cows ($110,000) and then build the dairy ($380,000).</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Cows</strong></p><p>To produce enough milk, we need to purchase 55 milking cows. But not just any cows – we want to use old breeds of cows, like Brown Swiss and Australian Dairy Shorthorn. These are breeds that are considered commercially unviable these days but were once both prized for producing excellent quality milk for cheesemaking. We have found the cows (from two different farms in Victoria) but need to purchase them and transport them to Tasmania early next year. The cows are going to cost approximately $2000 a head.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Dairy</strong></p><p>The dairy had been designed and drawn up. A great deal of thought has gone into this building. Most dairies are designed for the comfort of humans as much as cows. They are also designed to be very labour-efficient (to save money). Big commercial dairies are massive operations that milk hundreds of cows automatically. Our dairy will be very different. We want our cows to get lots of human contact and get milked in a milking parlour that is quiet and not stressful. Because we are cheesemakers and not selling milk into the commodity market, we will be able to put the welfare of our animals before anything else: happy, healthy cows = great cheese. This dairy will be built from scratch and will come in around $380,000.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why is this farm important?</strong></p><p>It is widely agreed that the dairy industry has some major issues. Farmers are now at the mercy of global markets and pricing. Dairy farms are getting bigger and bigger and now resemble milk factories more than farms. In order to stay afloat in this environment, farmers are forced to apply more and more pressure to their animals and land. Some struggle to stay afloat and are forced to leave the industry.</p><p>Our farm will be very different, because it will operate outside of the regular dairy industry. It will be small and organic. It will use old breeds that are no longer considered viable but were once prized for the quality of their milk. It will put animal welfare ahead of profitability and sustainability ahead of efficiency. We are committed to raising our calves, not slaughtering them as is the common industry practice with bobby calves. The breeds we have chosen are excellent dual-purpose breeds and will be raised on the property for rose veal and beef, which will then be offered back to our customers to purchase.</p><p>Since 2003, Bruny Island Cheese Co has pushed the boundaries and helped raise the standard for artisan cheese in Australia. When I first started the business, I was told that I had a choice: I could make a difference, or I could be successful. Well, I reckon we have done both. We were the first producer of unpasteurised milk cheese, despite being told it would never happen, and we reinvented the way cheese is sold in Australia through our Cheese Club. We are now an award winning successful small business, located on an island off the south coast of Tasmania, and every day we try and make a difference to the way cheese is made, sold and eaten in Australia.</p><p>Now we want to set a new standard in dairy farming. And we want you to be a part of it.</p><p>Being part of this project means you will be supporting positive change in the dairy industry and being part of a viable, sustainable alternative.  You can become part of our ‘Farm Family’ community and not only receive some great rewards for your support but also regular updates from the farm and opportunities to get involved in it.</p><p>Once the dairy is up and running we will start work on building a new cheesery on the farm. This new cheesery will be dedicated to only making raw milk (unpasteurised) cheeses – making it the only place of its kind in Australia. This will allow us to expand our raw milk cheese production and to have a platform where we can develop our cheeses even more.</p><p><strong>Together, we can do this. </strong></p><p>Bruny Island Cheese Co is a team of passionate, determined people. Here are some of the key people that will be involved in this project:</p><p><strong>Nick Haddow</strong>: Managing Director the founder of the business.

A native of Scotland, Jane now calls Bruny Island home and has been part of the business for the past three years. Jane has worked as a vet, organic vigneron, farmer and small business owner.</p><p><strong>Halsey Swetzoff</strong>: Production Manager. Halsey is our amazing head cheesemaker.
