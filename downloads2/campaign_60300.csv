<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/604192/files/20140525233540-examiner.jpg?1401086140"" src="""" style=""width: 153.75px; height: 41px;""/></p>
<p><b>Gymtrack</b> is a wearable device aimed to gamify exercise. The device is designed to be worn around the ankle, it monitors your physical activity and then it sends all data via Bluetooth to your laptop, tablet or smartphone. The software will translate that data into actions on a 3D video game that you play while you exercise!</p>
<p><b>Gymtrack offers a new way to experience exercise. </b>Other wearable devices related to fitness only track your physical activity, but you're still left with the fact that exercise can be a boring activity for most people. Without a motivation, it can be hard working out at the gym. </p>
<p>What are the benefits of using Gymtrack (some of the features)?</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy an augmented reality experience at the gym and keeps you motivated working out.</li>
<li>Track your activity in real time, and see relevant information from your workout such as speed, distance traveled, and estimated calories burned. </li>
<li>Set different goals (i.e lose some weight in a certain time period) and the software will guide you through different levels of difficulty so you can reach your goal in the desired time. </li>
<li>Train for a race (whether it's running, cycling, rowing or any other activity) by competing against the computer and beat it to make sure you can keep up depending on the level of difficulty you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p><b>Gymtrack is designed to worn around the ankle</b>. You put the device inside the band, tighten the strap around your ankle, turn it on, and connect to your computer, tablet or smartphone with Bluetooth! After connecting to your device, you will be able to start enjoying a fun workout session with an augmented reality interface that will monitor your physical activity in real time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The software consists of an app that you can run on your IOS, Android or Windows device. It's totally free! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Travel in a virtual world while you exercise</h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Whether you are cycling on a stationary bike, jogging on a treadmill or using any other fitness machine, you will always have a different game and virtual world to play in to make the workout session more enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Some of the most notable features of Gymtrack:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Compete against the computer, against other users online and even compete with yourself to beat your own record!</li>
<li>Choose among different virtual worlds and different game modes depending on the workout you want to do.</li>
<li>Track your progress in real time or in different time lapses (daily, weekly,  and monthly) so you can see your progress over time.</li>
<li>Incorporate social media to share your progress and physical activity with your friends and family. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Some future upgrades: </b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Play different type of games to keep you motivated while working out. For instance, want to escape from zombies while you run? Or you need to make sure you deliver all of the city's newspapers while you ride a bike? These are some of the concepts that we are currently working on to implement into our video game.</li>
<li>Interface other type of sensors to the Gymtrack such as a heart rate monitor. </li>
<li>Use the Gymtrack in different parts of the body (such as the wrist, and arms) to play different games for other types of exercises (i.e push-ups).</li>
<li>Use Gymtrack to play any other game you want and not just the exclusive games for the gymtrack. Want to play call of duty while you run? You will be able to do that!</li>
<li>Open API. Develop your own apps/games for the Gymtrack.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why do we need your support?</h3>
<p>We have a finished working prototype. Now we need to refine our prototype and get it ready for mass production. Our current prototype's case was produced with 3D printing technology, and the band was handcrafted. The final product, however, will be manufactured in a factory including the band and its case. In short, we need the money to refine our prototype, develop the software that will run on Android, IOS, and Windows, and do some major upgrades to our prototype such as making the device slightly smaller.</p>

</div></div>","Finally, a wearable device that makes exercise fun and enjoyable!Gymtrack was exposed at the Maker Faire in the Bay Area on May 2014!Featured on:



Gymtrack is a wearable device aimed to gamify exercise. The device is designed to be worn around the ankle, it monitors your physical activity and then it sends all data via Bluetooth to your laptop, tablet or smartphone. The software will translate that data into actions on a 3D video game that you play while you exercise!
Gymtrack offers a new way to experience exercise. Other wearable devices related to fitness only track your physical activity, but you're still left with the fact that exercise can be a boring activity for most people. Without a motivation, it can be hard working out at the gym. 
What are the benefits of using Gymtrack (some of the features)?

Enjoy an augmented reality experience at the gym and keeps you motivated working out.
Track your activity in real time, and see relevant information from your workout such as speed, distance traveled, and estimated calories burned. 
Set different goals (i.e lose some weight in a certain time period) and the software will guide you through different levels of difficulty so you can reach your goal in the desired time. 
Train for a race (whether it's running, cycling, rowing or any other activity) by competing against the computer and beat it to make sure you can keep up depending on the level of difficulty you choose.


How it works
Gymtrack is designed to worn around the ankle. You put the device inside the band, tighten the strap around your ankle, turn it on, and connect to your computer, tablet or smartphone with Bluetooth! After connecting to your device, you will be able to start enjoying a fun workout session with an augmented reality interface that will monitor your physical activity in real time.

The software consists of an app that you can run on your IOS, Android or Windows device. It's totally free! 


Travel in a virtual world while you exercise

Whether you are cycling on a stationary bike, jogging on a treadmill or using any other fitness machine, you will always have a different game and virtual world to play in to make the workout session more enjoyable.

Stationary bike




Treadmill



Rowing Machine



Elliptical



Features
Some of the most notable features of Gymtrack:


Compete against the computer, against other users online and even compete with yourself to beat your own record!
Choose among different virtual worlds and different game modes depending on the workout you want to do.
Track your progress in real time or in different time lapses (daily, weekly,  and monthly) so you can see your progress over time.
Incorporate social media to share your progress and physical activity with your friends and family. 

Some future upgrades: 




Play different type of games to keep you motivated while working out. For instance, want to escape from zombies while you run? Or you need to make sure you deliver all of the city's newspapers while you ride a bike? These are some of the concepts that we are currently working on to implement into our video game.
Interface other type of sensors to the Gymtrack such as a heart rate monitor. 
Use the Gymtrack in different parts of the body (such as the wrist, and arms) to play different games for other types of exercises (i.e push-ups).
Use Gymtrack to play any other game you want and not just the exclusive games for the gymtrack. Want to play call of duty while you run? You will be able to do that!
Open API. Develop your own apps/games for the Gymtrack.


Why do we need your support?
We have a finished working prototype. Now we need to refine our prototype and get it ready for mass production. Our current prototype's case was produced with 3D printing technology, and the band was handcrafted. The final product, however, will be manufactured in a factory including the band and its case. In short, we need the money to refine our prototype, develop the software that will run on Android, IOS, and Windows, and do some major upgrades to our prototype such as making the device slightly smaller.
Perks
Some of the perks that we are offering to our supporters!

- $15 Get one of the bands! Just tell us the color you'd prefer and we will send one to you!




- $25 Your Gymtrack T-shirt!

- $29 Your Gymtrack polo shirt!



- $120 Early stage prototype! Be one the first ones to try out the prototype! You will receive a band with the color of your choice, and a fully working Gymtrack.

<h1>BEACON by LumaGlo: </h1>
<div>The BEACON by LumaGlo is an wearable, smart, bluetooth-controlled LED lighting system that provides intense visibility from every angle. It's custom iOS and Android app allows you to choose 16 million colors to gain the attention needed for your situation. The dynamic patterns allow you to create intense visibility from several blocks away and helps to prevent the light from being overpowered by street lamps and headlights. The intensity of the light is spectacular and can be seen from hundreds of feet away. </div>
<div>We took it one step further by integrating a wearable brake light for cyclists. The built-in accelerometer can sense when speeds are reduced and will begin flashing RED to alert drivers around them. </div>
<div>
<p></p>But wait, there's more! The smart phone connection sends visual notifications from your phone to your lights--stay plugged in even while you're on-the-go! </div>

<h1>Why would I use endless colors and patterns? </h1>
<div>Great question. While we don't think anyone will use all 16 million colors (I wonder how that long would take?). It's incredibly awesome that you have the ability to choose every color under the sun! This really is the <i>ultimate</i> device for self expression. <p></p>
<p>But more importantly, you can use your full controllability and customization to <b>increase safety</b>. Here are some examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>Flashing red pattern in an emergency situation</li>
<li>Brighter, flashier patterns in city rush hour traffic. White and red lights are easily overpowered by street lights. Use Blue and yellow to really stand out! </li>
<li>Maybe you're on a run in a rural area. A solid color may be all you need. </li>
<li>Crossing a busy street? Try the orbit pattern. It's animated and will draw attention. </li>
<li>Sending your kids to school? You probably don't want to take any chances. Try a multi-colored chase patterns. It's bright, colorful and animated.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How is it powered?  </h1>
<p>Every belt contains a compact  micro USB rechargeable battery. </p>
<p><b>How long will the battery last before it needs charged? </b>The short answer to this is between 2-10 hours. Different colors and patterns consume different amounts of power. For example, solid colors require more power and flashing patterns require less. Also, full white consumes the most power, whereas colors consume less. </p>
<p>Maybe you need it to be more intense so it can be seen broad during daylight, but in the dark you can reduce the brightness down to as low as 10% to conserve power yet still be seen. Want to be more visible? Crank it up to 100% and you'll stop traffic! </p>
<p>Charging is simple and fast! Just plug in the micro USB and let it do its magic! </p>

<h1>Our Development Process:</h1>
<p>In November 2013, we launched our first kickstarter campaign--Freedom Lighting--which was a modular, wall or battery powered, Bluetooth controlled, LED strip. We gained valuable insight into which traits of the product concept were popular--a ""wearable"" LED strip.  </p>
<p>Next we consulted with a wide variety of people: runners, cyclist, business mentors, designers and anyone else interested, for their feedback on what would make for a compelling product. The consensus was to use ""Dual Mode"" Bluetooth for control and a relatively large battery to provide a long duration of visibility. Dual mode Bluetooth support offers compatibility will virtually ALL smart phones and a battery capacity of over 1000 mAh would power the LED strip for over 2 hours. Having these two primary design goals clarified, we began designing form factor and the LED strip controller.  </p>

<p>As for the project aesthetic, we determined a belt form factor would provide the best means to house the LED strip and we determined that a strong fabric belt with a large buckle would provide robust protection, but would remain light enough to not burden the user. We experimented with various colors and form factors, ultimately settling on black with a white sleeve for the LED strip so as not to reduce the light output.  </p>
<p>Finally, we needed to design the controller. We opted to place the battery inside the controller enclosure to tightly integrate the microprocessor and power supply and reduce the form factor. This also means the only exposed connector is a micro USB for charging the battery. The final result is a sleek, lightweight design.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>We spent 18 months designing and developing this product and have strategically planned each manufacturing phase of the LumaGlo BEACON. We are confident we have the infrastructure in place and can fully execute. However, as with all new product inventions of this scale, there are inherent risks and challenges involved. This is primarily because we rely heavily on outside sources to execute their plans as efficiently as we expect. We have 20+ years developing hi-tech consumer products for our employers--this brings us confidence in our abilities to solve problems, move beyond setbacks and build alternate plans in our infrastructure to keep things moving forward with integrity.</p>
<p>With that being said, we are excited to share this journey with you and look forward to SAVING LIVES!</p>
<p>-Jill, Randy, Russ &amp; Ward <br/>Co-founders</p>
</div><h3><br/></h3></div>","Every 2 minutes, a pedestrian/cyclist is killed. Millions more are injured every year--many left permanently disabled. Traditional forward-facing headlights and red tail lights on bicycles are inadequate and ineffective.They are dull, overpowered by street lights and headlamps, easily covered by backpacks or clothing, blend in with the environment--and in most cases can't be seen from angles. Reflective clothing requires headlights to be shown directly on the subject to be seen and arm bands only provide visibility on one side of the body. We knew something needed to be done. So we created a solution....
The BEACON is the solution. 




BEACON by LumaGlo: 
The BEACON by LumaGlo is an wearable, smart, bluetooth-controlled LED lighting system that provides intense visibility from every angle. It's custom iOS and Android app allows you to choose 16 million colors to gain the attention needed for your situation. The dynamic patterns allow you to create intense visibility from several blocks away and helps to prevent the light from being overpowered by street lamps and headlights. The intensity of the light is spectacular and can be seen from hundreds of feet away. 
We took it one step further by integrating a wearable brake light for cyclists. The built-in accelerometer can sense when speeds are reduced and will begin flashing RED to alert drivers around them. 

But wait, there's more! The smart phone connection sends visual notifications from your phone to your lights--stay plugged in even while you're on-the-go! 

""It's the only product invented that integrates safety with wearable technology."" 



Accelerometer-based brake light!
Yes, you read that right! This is the ultimate safety device for cyclists. The lights will begin flashing an intense red pattern when you come to a stop. When you pick up speed it will automatically revert back to the previous pattern. 

*motorcyclists check with your state traffic laws regarding use of multi-colored LED's on roadways. 





VISUAL NOTIFICATIONS:
Stay connected even when you're on-the-go. The lights will notify you when you get a message, text, phone call, etc.  








Millions of colors!

True. Millions. This is the ultimate device for self expression! The custom Android & iOS app allows you to choose up to 16 MILLION colors for each  LED node. Set the color to match your mood!





Dynamic & animated patterns!  
Choose a pattern that gets attention for your situation. Every single LED node is individually controllable. Yes. Every single one. 
This allows you to choose vibrant, eye-catching patterns to gain added visibility. 

 
Why would I use endless colors and patterns? 
Great question. While we don't think anyone will use all 16 million colors (I wonder how that long would take?). It's incredibly awesome that you have the ability to choose every color under the sun! This really is the ultimate device for self expression. 
But more importantly, you can use your full controllability and customization to increase safety. Here are some examples: 

Flashing red pattern in an emergency situation
Brighter, flashier patterns in city rush hour traffic. White and red lights are easily overpowered by street lights. Use Blue and yellow to really stand out! 
Maybe you're on a run in a rural area. A solid color may be all you need. 
Crossing a busy street? Try the orbit pattern. It's animated and will draw attention. 
Sending your kids to school? You probably don't want to take any chances. Try a multi-colored chase patterns. It's bright, colorful and animated.

And millions of other ways to grab attention. 






How is BEACON different than other LED belts? 
We've spent 1.5 years perfecting the design to create a device that saves lives while offering useful and meaningful features. See for yourself! 





How is it powered?  
Every belt contains a compact  micro USB rechargeable battery. 
How long will the battery last before it needs charged? The short answer to this is between 2-10 hours. Different colors and patterns consume different amounts of power. For example, solid colors require more power and flashing patterns require less. Also, full white consumes the most power, whereas colors consume less. 
Maybe you need it to be more intense so it can be seen broad during daylight, but in the dark you can reduce the brightness down to as low as 10% to conserve power yet still be seen. Want to be more visible? Crank it up to 100% and you'll stop traffic! 
Charging is simple and fast! Just plug in the micro USB and let it do its magic! 


SIZING: 


Every belt is adjustable. In the photo above, the adjustable section is pure black and does not contain LED's. It is tucked behind the belt for photo purposes only. **note: on average, 2/3 of each belt is lit, the remaining 1/3 allows for adjustability so that every person gets the perfect fit!

Adult sizes: Choose from 3 sizes: fits waists 28-40"" (approx 2/3 lit)
Sash style: Adjustable from 50-60"" (approx 2/3 lit)

<p>We are a group of Duke University students, student-athletes, volunteers, and professors that are devoted to working with the local Durham, NC latino community. Our passion for community development has led to the foundation of Soccer Sin Fronteras (Soccer Without Limits), a non-profit after school program that aims to develop high school students' leadership and academic achievement through soccer.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We conceived the idea of starting a free-to-play soccer league
for local latino high school students in the summer of 2014 while enrolled in a
12-week long Intensive Spanish Language Program. This program was taught by
Professor Liliana Paredes, who is well connected in the local Latino community
and possesses a passion for service. Because of this passion, the program
incorporated diverse Latino cultural education and involvement in the Durham
community. At the end of the program Professor Paredes then recruited her former Duke students, many
of whom are student-athletes, to set up Soccer Sin Fronteras! After a long semester of
logistical preparation, we are finally ready to launch. All we need is your
support!</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>The goal is that the league will serve as a beneficial and productive way for students to spend their free time after school. Initially we wanted to start a program that just involved playing sports to have fun, but after a brief discussion our team decided to also incorporate leadership and academic achievement workshops. This way the program keeps kids active, while also developing their character and helping them achieve their goals. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>Why we need your support</h3>
<p>Starting a soccer program has been much more expensive than our team originally thought. It may not seem like an expensive endeavor, but the costs certainly add up. However, if we reach our goal of $4,000, all of this year's expenses will be covered. </p>

<li>Renting Vans for Travel<br/>
</li>
<li>Registration Fees</li>
<li>Equipment</li>
<li>Storage</li>
</ul>Specifically, our team needs to reserve fields for practices, scrimmages, and games. Many participants do not have access to transportation, therefore we will need to provide additional transportation in order to be a competitive organization beyond the Durham community. To do this, registering for tournaments and official club titles can be surprisingly expensive. Lastly, any good team needs good gear and somewhere to put it!</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>We are in the process of making Soccer Sin Fronteras an officially recognized student group, which will allow us to apply for Duke student group funding and be able to recruit new members. Professor Paredes is also incorporating Soccer Sin Fronteras into her upcoming classes, therefore involving more Spanish-speaking students that are passionate for service. Professor Hidalgo, associate director of Soccer Sin Fronteras, is also pitching administrators and recruiting students for a Soccer Sin Fronteras class next semester. We are confident that we will overcome any challenges set forth and will persevere in making Soccer Sin Fronteras a sustainable and successful after school program!</p>

</div></div>","Amazing Air Conditioner is the personal and portable air conditioner with an energy bill of less than 3 cents a month. This personalized air conditioner was designed to focus its cooling effect on the area around the user thereby using a minimal amount of energy compared to traditional air conditioners or electric fans. 



Amazing Air Conditioner only requires an electrical power consumption of 1.5W and therefore can run on a micro 5 pin charger. That is nearly 1/30th the power consumption of an electric fan and 1/1000th the power consumption of even a basic air conditioner. 
This microscopic level of power consumption makes Amazing Air Conditioner incredibly cost-effective. Less energy consumption means more money saved on your energy bill. Even if used 8 hours a day for a whole month, the energy used by Amazing Air Conditioner will only cost you 3 cents. 












Amazing Air Conditioner is a personal air conditioner. Designed with a flexible neck, cool air flow can be directed to a targeted area. Unlike wasteful standard air conditioners that flow through the whole room, often to cool a single person, Amazing Air Conditioner offers personalized cooling.  




Amazing Air Conditioner is light weight so you can take it with you from room to room. Powered by a micro 5-pin charger, you can even run Amazing Air Conditioner with a portable cell phone charger. Use Amazing Air Conditioner indoors or outdoors for clean and fresh air wherever you go .








TIP: When you sleep, direct Amazing Air Conditioner's airflow beneath your blanket for a cool and comfortable rest. Standard air conditioners, if left on all night, can make you catch a cold or dry out your skin. Beyond that, if kept on for prolonged periods of time, you'll face a scary energy bill. Avoid the annoying ritual of waking up to turn off the air conditioner in the middle of the night with Amazing Air Conditioner.


Amazing Air Conditioner also has an LED light in its neck to act as an energy efficient night light. Get fresh air and add ambiance with Amazing Air Conditioner's soft glowing light. 



We often don't think about it but electricity is derived from natural resources including natural gas and coal. These resources are limited and therefore it is important to conserve electricity not just for money concerns but also for environmental reasons.  



Amazing Air Conditioner is capable of incredibly low power usage because it doesn't just derive its cooling power from electricity but also from ice! By using the natural cold of ice, Amazing Air Conditioner is the most eco-friendly air conditioner in the world. When equipped with a frozen ice chamber, Amazing Air Conditioner can keep you cool for up to 8 hours. With three chambers, you can stay cool all day long! Personal, portable and environmentally friendly Amazing Air Conditioner is the only A.C. you need to fight the heat. 








With its simple one-touch button, Amazing Air Conditioner can be turned OFF, increase air flow strength, and switch to air purifier mode.  












It is important to consider the air we breathe. Over exposure to the cold blast of a standard air conditioner can cause colds and respiratory diseases. When not cleaned properly, Air conditioners build up bacteria and germs that are re-circulated through out the room. Especially for children, the elderly, and those with conditions such as asthma, standard air conditioners can pose a health risk.   
Unlike standard air conditioners, Amazing Air Conditioner also acts as an air purifier to remove harmful airborne particles as small as 0.3 um. With its wound filter design, Amazing Air Conditioner has an expansive surface area to catch countless pollutants with no need for frequent replacement. Just clean the filter once a month with water. Amazing Air Conditioner has been proven to filter airborne particles and chemicals including: Micro-dust, CO2, Gas Fumes, Pollen, Mold, Viruses, Allergens, Germs, Bacteria, Formaldehyde, Toluene and Benzene.




Amazing Grace was founded on the principle of service to both humanity and the world. We believe that products are a reflection of the developers that create them. In Amazing Air Conditioner, we were inspired by Earth Hour where the world joins together to turn off the lights in order to combat climate change. We thought how could we offer a positive change to the world? For three years we developed Amazing Air Conditioner in the hope that it can create a small but meaningful push in the fight to conserve electricity.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

He is one of 30,000+ people in the US currently trying to survive ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ""Lou Gehrig's Disease""). Since his diagnosis, ALS has taken a very heavy toll on him and his family; <a href=""http://www.friends4eric.org/aboutme"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a toll that is personal, financial, and emotional</a>. Even though Eric gradually became quadriplegic, losing all personal independence, and is now being kept alive only through the use of a mechanical ventilator, his mind has stayed sharp.<br/><br/>Instead of giving up, Eric decided to fight ALS. Though he is past his last natural breath, he took control of his situation. Through the use of a computer system which tracks the movement of his right eye (very similar to the technology used by another well known ALS patient - Stephen Hawking), he used the Internet to train himself in neuroscience then built a coalition of fellow patient activists and biotech entrepreneurs. Along with partners Ryan Bethencourt, Andrew Gengos, and Joseph Jackson, Eric founded SciOpen Research Group. SRG is a non-profit biotech with the sole purpose of developing J147 and other therapeutics for ALS, an orphan disease which has historically been neglected.<br/><br/>Eric and the SRG team created this crowdfunding campaign to fund the histopathology (microscopic tissue examination) lab work needed to better analyze the results of our already-ongoing study at the Salk Institute. Through this work, which will be published in a public Open-Access journal, SRG can bring J147 closer to the clinic for ALS patients.<p><b><i><u><font color=""009999"" size=""5"">This is SciOpen Research Group</font></u></i></b><br/><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F4x4efcbRRWg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4x4efcbRRWg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4x4efcbRRWg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p><b><i><u><font color=""009999"" size=""5"">6000 Americans Die From ALS Every Year</font></u></i></b><br/><br/>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (aka ALS or ""Lou Gehrig's Disease"") is the most horrible neurodegenerative condition possible. It strikes in the prime of life, robbing the person of movement while keeping the mind sharp and all too aware of the prison of their increasingly-inert bodies. Because 90% of those afflicted die within two to five years of diagnosis, the number of patients living at any single moment is relatively low. Therefore, big pharmaceutical companies have deemed it unprofitable and research to bring treatments into the clinic has lagged. Lag equals lost lives.<br/><br/>Because ALS frequently hits in the prime of life, it creates a severe economic drag in terms of lost productivity. This extends beyond the patient to the family, <a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_22102247/cost-dying-at-home-caregivers-face-challenges-sacrifice"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bankrupting savings and destroying careers as they try to care for their loved one.</a><br/><br/>With the explosion in technology, advanced scientific tools are now available to citizen scientists. This has led to the formation of ""hacker"" biolabs and the emergence of a movement called ""guerrilla biotech"". SciOpen Research Group is the first fully operational guerrilla biotech. We are dedicated to doing the difficult science that for-profit pharmaceutical companies find too ""risky"".

He is one of 30,000+ people in the US currently trying to survive ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ""Lou Gehrig's Disease""). Since his diagnosis, ALS has taken a very heavy toll on him and his family; a toll that is personal, financial, and emotional. Even though Eric gradually became quadriplegic, losing all personal independence, and is now being kept alive only through the use of a mechanical ventilator, his mind has stayed sharp.Instead of giving up, Eric decided to fight ALS. Though he is past his last natural breath, he took control of his situation. Through the use of a computer system which tracks the movement of his right eye (very similar to the technology used by another well known ALS patient - Stephen Hawking), he used the Internet to train himself in neuroscience then built a coalition of fellow patient activists and biotech entrepreneurs. Along with partners Ryan Bethencourt, Andrew Gengos, and Joseph Jackson, Eric founded SciOpen Research Group. SRG is a non-profit biotech with the sole purpose of developing J147 and other therapeutics for ALS, an orphan disease which has historically been neglected.Eric and the SRG team created this crowdfunding campaign to fund the histopathology (microscopic tissue examination) lab work needed to better analyze the results of our already-ongoing study at the Salk Institute. Through this work, which will be published in a public Open-Access journal, SRG can bring J147 closer to the clinic for ALS patients.This is SciOpen Research Group6000 Americans Die From ALS Every YearAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (aka ALS or ""Lou Gehrig's Disease"") is the most horrible neurodegenerative condition possible. It strikes in the prime of life, robbing the person of movement while keeping the mind sharp and all too aware of the prison of their increasingly-inert bodies. Because 90% of those afflicted die within two to five years of diagnosis, the number of patients living at any single moment is relatively low. Therefore, big pharmaceutical companies have deemed it unprofitable and research to bring treatments into the clinic has lagged. Lag equals lost lives.Because ALS frequently hits in the prime of life, it creates a severe economic drag in terms of lost productivity. This extends beyond the patient to the family, bankrupting savings and destroying careers as they try to care for their loved one.With the explosion in technology, advanced scientific tools are now available to citizen scientists. This has led to the formation of ""hacker"" biolabs and the emergence of a movement called ""guerrilla biotech"". SciOpen Research Group is the first fully operational guerrilla biotech. We are dedicated to doing the difficult science that for-profit pharmaceutical companies find too ""risky"". We can do novel and creative scientific experiments necessary to bring basic research discoveries, bridging the ""Valley of Death"" between lab bench to patient bedside. And we make the results of our work available to the public, not hidden behind paywalls.There is of course risk. This is science. The SOD1 ALS mouse testing is currently ongoing and there is no guarantee that J147 will succeed in significantly prolonging the lives of those mice.

Résumé
Nous avons beson de votre aide pour boucler nos frais de voyage et de production d'un zine sur l'attention somatique au travail sur ordinateur.

Anne Goldenberg est une artiste chercheuse qui aime l'univers hacker sous un jour poétique et féministe. Karine Rathle est une danseuse et éducatrice somatique qui s'intéresse au bien-être dans toute sorte de condition. Nous travaillons depuis un an sur les rapports d'intimités de créativité et de libertés vis-à-vis de l'informatique et sur l'attention à soi dans le travail sur ordinateur.

 

En juin, nous partons pour Hobart, en Australie, pour participer au festival NAF:TMC


(Networked Art Forms: Tactical Magick Faerie Circuits) ou Tactical Magick pour les intimes. Ce fantastique festival rassemblera des artistes, des théoricien.ne,s, des techno-chamans, des fées électriques et d'autres magicien.ne.s qui viendront du monde entier pour partager leurs imaginaires, leurs secrets et leurs explorations dans le domaine des arts médiatiques, de l'art réseau et de la performance multimédia. Il est présenté par le hackerspace feministe Miss Desponia. 

 

Nous allons donner une performance  (White Magic | Black Magic), qui confronte le sentiment de pouvoir dans  les univers Macintosh et Linux, une des réalisation du projet ERSE qui s'intéresse à l'Esthétique Relationnelle des Systémes d'Exploitation. 

 

Nous avons aussi été invitées à profiter d'une résidence à la galerie Constance ARI pendant 10 jours pour donner des ateliers d'Attent!on Som(T)ac(t)ics.  


Ces ateliers s'inscrivent dans le projet Working Still-Still Working, une recherche création qui s'intéresse aux problèmes de l'immobilité et de la durée du travail sur ordinateur.


Attent!on Som(T)ac(t)ics vise à réfléchir aux dimensions assujetisantes du travail sur ordinateur et à construire un corpus de propositions poétiques d'émancipation somatiques : 


Un confessionnal somatique amène tout d'abord les participant.e.s à raconter, décrire ou subjuguer leurs routines relationnelles avec leur ordinateurs. 


Illes sont ensuite conduit.es à explorer des avenues d’émancipation par des exercices et des improvisations somatiques.

Finalement, les participant.e.s seront convié.e.s à réaliser des propositions tactiques et poétiques d'émancipation somatique pour travail à l'ordinateur.


Les résultats des ateliers seront présentés sous la forme d'une installation à la fin du festival NAF:TMFC. Nous produirons aussi un zine bilingue français et anglais qui sera distribué à notre retour d'Australie, dans différents centres d'artistes, médialab et autres lieux de travail intéréssés par ces formes d'émancipation...et à vous, si vous nous soutenez.


 


Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez
Nous avons besoin de votre soutien pour entrer dans nos frais de voyage et de production.
Le billet coute 2100 dollars chacune environ.
Jusqu'alors, nous avons réussi à financer 65 % de nos frais de transport (avec une bourse de  LOJIQ et une autre du Conseil des Arts du Canada). Il nous manquerait en gros 700x2, soit 1400 dollars. 
 
Nous partons fin mai, et pour un mois. Nous serons logées par les amies là-bas, mais aurons besoin de manger, boire quelques cafés, et d'acheter un peu de matériel pour la tenue des ateliers et la constitution des zines. Pour cela nous avons besoin d'un autre petit 1000 dollars au moins. D'ou cette demande de soutien, 2500, pour qu'on ne se ruinent pas (plus) en route :-).
 


L'impact
Notre participation à ce festival, la tenue des ateliers et l'exposition subséquente consistuent un moment majeur pour l'avancée du projet ERSE et WorkingStill/StillWorking. 
Dans un premier temps, les ateliers alimenteront le site WorkingStill/StillWorking et constituera le contenu du zine.
 
Une présentation publique des résultats de l'atelier et une distribution du zine aura lieu à l'automne 2013 au Lab NT2, à Montréal (Un très chouette laboratoire de littérature numérique qui soutient techniquement ce projet).
 

A long terme, les ateliers Attent!on Som(T)ac(t)ics contribueront à nourrir une plateforme multimédia d'émancipation collective pour le bien-être au travail sur ordinateur. L'utopie en bout de ligne étant de nous soutenir, poétiquement et somatiquement, dans notre quotidien de travail à l'ordinateur. Est-ce que cela vous fait aussi rêver ?




D'autres façons d'aider
Si vous ne voulez pas utiliser le web pour déposer de l'argent, nous pouvons nous arranger. Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement, vous pouvez aider autrement.

Passez le mot et faites de la publicité autour de ce projet.
Aidez-nous a confectionner le zine.
Donnez-nous des psst de financements.
Envoyez-nous de bonnes idées.


Merci à vous 
on espère que cela vous inspire comme cela nous enthousiasme...
au plaisir,
 
Som(t)a(t)icquement votre, 
Anne et Karine

Summary
 

We need you help to finance a trip and  the production fees for a zine on somatic education on computer mediated work.
 

Anne Goldenberg is an artist researcher who loves the hacker world with a feminist and poetic touch. Karine Rathle  is a dancer and somatic educator interested in well-being for all kinds of conditions. We have been working together for more then a year now on the intimite relation of creativity and liberty of technology and the well-being of the body and mind when working on computers. 

 

 In June, we are going to Hobart in Australia for the  NAF:TMC ( Networked Art Forms: Tactical Magick Faerie Circuits) festival or Tactile Magic for friends. 

The amazing festival brings together artists, theorist, techno-chamans and other magiciens from around the world to share their creativity, their secrets and explorations in the fields of mediatic arts, network art and multimedia performance. It is presented by the feminist hackerspace Miss Desponia.
 
We  will be performing at the begining of the festival (White Magic Black  Magic) a piece that confrontes the power struggle between the universes of Macintosh and Linux, a further exploration under the ERSE project  (acronim from the french title : Esthétique Relationnelle des Systémes  d'Exploitation)
 

We have also been invited for a residency at Constance ARI for 10 days to give Attent!on Som(T)ac(t)ics workshops.

These workshops are part of  the Working Still-Still Working, a research and developpement project  looking through a poetic lense at the implication of immobility and at  the length of time spent in front of a computer. 

Attent!on Som(T)ac(t)icsaims to reflect upon the wider dimension of working with computers and  exploring emancipatory propositions through somatic explorations and  liberating exercises. 

 


First the participants will  have the freedom to explore a somatic confessional where they will  brought to tell us their tales, write or subjugate their relational  routines with their personal computer.




Then the participants are guided to explore creative emancipatory avenues through techno-humanist improvised suggestions. 




Finally, the participants will be conveyed to create tactic and poetic propositions of somatic emancipation for computer work. 


 
The results of the workshops  will be presented through an installation at the end of the festival  NAF:TMFC and a bilingual Zine will be distributed at our return of  Australia in different artist centers, medialabs and other venues  interested in these forms of emancipation... and to you if you support  our project. 
 
 

Impact
 
Our  participation at this festival, through workshops, performances and an  exhibition, constitutes a major advancement for the project ERSE and WorkingStill | StillWorking. In the first instance the workshops will feed the website of WorkingStill/StillWorking and will constitute the content of the Zine. 
Another public presentation has been scheduled in Automn 2013 at Lab NT2, UQAM, Montreal. 

In the long term, the workshops  Attent!on Som(T)ac(t)ics will contribute to build a collective multimedia emancipatory plateform for the well-being of computer work. The ultimate utopia is that we would be self-supported poetically and somatically while working daily on computers. Does that make you dream as well?



What we need and what you get

We need your support to help with the cost of travelling and production. The plane tickets cost 2100 CAN$ each, and for now we are financed at 65% of our transport fees through LOJIC and the Canada Council for the Arts. We are still missing 700X2 for the plane tickets and since we are leaving for a month, although we will be living with friends there, we still need to eat and buy some material for the workshops and the creation of the Zines. Roughly another 1000 CAN$, which explains this support request of 2500 CAN$. This will help us not get ruined in the process of this amazing project :-)
 
 


Other ways to help us
If you don't want to use the web to deposit money, we can make arrangements. If you can't contribute financially, you can help us in other ways.

Spread the word and make some publicity around this project.
Help us build the Zine.
Give us hints on how to finance it.
Send us good ideas.


 
Thank you so so much! 
We hope that this inspires you as much as us!

<h3>Hello.... my name is Kate and I'm the mother of Jake, 8 years old and Brook, 19 months. Brook has been diagnosed with a rare, neurological disorder. She was born perfectly healthy until the age of 6 months.... she then lost the ability to do anything. She has never spoken, she has never walked, she is fed 100% by a feeding tube... she has no purposeful hand use, she can't bare any weight on her legs, she can't hold her own head up due to severe hypotonia and, just two weeks ago, we were informed that she has lost her sight due to a storage disorder that has destroyed both optic nerves and both retina's. Brook was diagnosed with Tay-Sachs Disease on July 23rd, 2012. This is fatal. Most children do not live past the age of 4 years old.</h3>
<h3>This campaign is very important to our family for many reasons but the most important reason is to keep Brook as comfortable as possible while she is with us. Part of this horrible disease is atrophy of the muscles. They become stiff and eventually, unable to be moved at all. This is already happening to Brook and we need to keep her as comfortable as possible.... we only have one bathroom in our house and the tub is very small. I am hoping to raise enough fund to re-construct our downstairs bathroom into a full bath with a whirlpool rub that has a chair lift attached. </h3>
<h3>
<br/>I attached a picture of Brook when she was still able to sit in her bumbo chair and take a bath in the sink. She is in pure BLISS in this picture. Water changes her... it helps her.... it relieves the pain she has in her muscles and it's become almost impossible to bath her in our small bathtub.</h3>
<h3>The funds from this campaign will go towards the contractor, the electrician and the plumber as well as all of the materials needed. She will also need a special chair lift to put her in and take her out of the tub.</h3>
<h3>My goal is to raise enough money to complete this project and perhaps have additional funds to take my son, with Brook, on a trip. Jake, my 8 year old, does not yet know that what Brook has is fatal and she, most likely, will not live past the age of 4 years old. I want to be able to have a memory that we can all remember together before she is taken from us. Until then, my goal is to keep her as happy and as comfortable as possible.</h3>
<h3>I can't tell you how much any donation will mean to us and to learm more about Tay-Sachs Disease, please go to: <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>

I always knew I didn't fit in this body, and in my late teens, I started transitioning. I've been on testosterone for 5.5 years now. <div><br/></div><div>One of the most important changes I needed to make for myself was chest surgery, a double mastectomy with contouring. It would give me a masculine chest and is not the same as a mastectomy. 

It's commonly referred to as Top Surgery. <span><br/></span>
<span><br/></span>April 1st, Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness announced that MSI would fund SRS, sexual reassignment surgeries. On their list of procedures covered, mastectomies are listed but contouring is NOT covered. They do not fund this necessary part of the procedure because they don't understand that it isn't just the flatness that matters in the end, it's the fact that I want to identify with that piece of my body. It's the difference between doing it for other people's comfort, so they aren't confused about my gender and doing it for me, so I can enjoy my life.
<span><br/></span>
<span><br/></span>You may have come across my name in the news a few times in the past few years. I had a hysterectomy in 2010 and was forced to leave the hospital just 24 hours after the hysto began. Adding insult to injury, MSI claimed that the hysto was part of my transition and they would not pay for it, or the hospital care, despite the fact that it was a medically necessary surgery.
<span><br/></span>Since then I've been working with a great lawyer on the Human Rights case I filed against MSI. I won the Raymond Taavel Media Award from Nova Scotia Rainbow Action Project in 2012. I played a part in the amending of Nova Scotia's Human Rights Act to include protections for gender expression and gender identity. In the last few months, I started a non profit organization, Nova Scotia Trans* Justice. It has great Directors who all care as much as i do about leveling the playing field for Trans folks in NS. <span><br/></span>
<span><br/></span>12000$ is a lot of money and for the longest time I didn't want to ask for help. I figured this was my cross to bear and everyone else has their own problems to deal with. But I haven't come close to that on my own. <span><br/></span>
No, I'm not working at the moment. The unemployment rate in Pictou County is sky high and I also have a criminal record which makes it even harder to find work. I pled Guilty to Production of Cannabis in 2013. I was growing pot to try to make enough money to get Top Surgery. I didn't know what I was doing, I hated it, I hate plants in general. By the time i was arrested in February of last year, i had been at it for 8 months or so and had hardly made enough money to feed myself and my two cats. We spent a month with no running water. Most of the plants died. They'd be fine when they got there and die before they made anyone money. <span><br/></span>

Desperation makes us do things we wouldn't normally do. Like indoor gardening. If the province funded SRS I wouldn't have a criminal record today.
<span><br/></span>
<span><br/></span>If I don't reach my goal, there are other options. The quote I have is for The Landings Surgical Centre in Halifax, but there are other surgeons outside of NS that do this procedure often enough that they charge less for it. </div><div>Please check back for new perks and update!</div><div>
<p>Every little bit helps! Thank you so much!</p>

I've been on testosterone for 5.5 years now. One of the most important changes I needed to make for myself was chest surgery, a double mastectomy with contouring. It would give me a masculine chest and is not the same as a mastectomy. 

It's commonly referred to as Top Surgery. 
April 1st, Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness announced that MSI would fund SRS, sexual reassignment surgeries. On their list of procedures covered, mastectomies are listed but contouring is NOT covered. They do not fund this necessary part of the procedure because they don't understand that it isn't just the flatness that matters in the end, it's the fact that I want to identify with that piece of my body. It's the difference between doing it for other people's comfort, so they aren't confused about my gender and doing it for me, so I can enjoy my life.

You may have come across my name in the news a few times in the past few years. I had a hysterectomy in 2010 and was forced to leave the hospital just 24 hours after the hysto began. Adding insult to injury, MSI claimed that the hysto was part of my transition and they would not pay for it, or the hospital care, despite the fact that it was a medically necessary surgery.
Since then I've been working with a great lawyer on the Human Rights case I filed against MSI. I won the Raymond Taavel Media Award from Nova Scotia Rainbow Action Project in 2012. I played a part in the amending of Nova Scotia's Human Rights Act to include protections for gender expression and gender identity. In the last few months, I started a non profit organization, Nova Scotia Trans* Justice. It has great Directors who all care as much as i do about leveling the playing field for Trans folks in NS. 
12000$ is a lot of money and for the longest time I didn't want to ask for help. I figured this was my cross to bear and everyone else has their own problems to deal with. But I haven't come close to that on my own. 
No, I'm not working at the moment. The unemployment rate in Pictou County is sky high and I also have a criminal record which makes it even harder to find work. I pled Guilty to Production of Cannabis in 2013. I was growing pot to try to make enough money to get Top Surgery. I didn't know what I was doing, I hated it, I hate plants in general. By the time i was arrested in February of last year, i had been at it for 8 months or so and had hardly made enough money to feed myself and my two cats. We spent a month with no running water. Most of the plants died. They'd be fine when they got there and die before they made anyone money. 

Desperation makes us do things we wouldn't normally do. Like indoor gardening. If the province funded SRS I wouldn't have a criminal record today.

If I don't reach my goal, there are other options. The quote I have is for The Landings Surgical Centre in Halifax, but there are other surgeons outside of NS that do this procedure often enough that they charge less for it. Please check back for new perks and update!
Every little bit helps! Thank you so much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Here's the deal:</h3>
<p>Life is stressful. Emma, Katya, and Morgan are here to help. As three girls experiencing the pressures of high school, we know our peers need something to destress and we have the skills to make it.</p> <p>We wanted to find a way to support our classmates before big presentations or difficult tests when we couldn’t physically be there. Talking with everyone from friends with social anxiety to friends who fidget, we developed Unwind, a product to help put pauses in your day and allow you to recenter yourself. With a vibrating, pulse-like rhythm, you can alleviate built-up anxiousness and sync your breathing to a brightening and dimming light.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Prototype</h3>
<p>Currently, our prototype contains a circuit board, induction charging coil, and battery inside of a soft silicone shell with an additional induction charging pad. The object is openable via an acrylic ring in the center so the electronics are accessible. As we move towards manufacturing, we are looking to size down the electronics by fabricating our own circuit board. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Moving forward, we need your help to begin manufacturing. With your generous contributions, we will start production using injection silicone molding combined with a custom circuit board. We will likely need $5,000 for injection molding, $3,000 for materials, and $2,000 for the overall assembly. And what better way to thank you for your support than branded tchotchkes! In our ‘perks’ section you will see everything from stickers to t-shirts that show our gratitude for investing both money and faith in Unwind.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>From fifth graders with restless hands to businesspeople preparing for an important meeting, Unwind can comfort any age on any stage. Although Unwind was originally designed to alleviate social anxiety, its calming nature serves to combat many common stressors of daily life.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge in the manufacturing and production process is that we have never done it before. But that isn’t going to stop us. With an awesome network of resources, we are confident that we can find our way to a well-designed, well-produced, and well-received final product. However, that might take a little more time than your average startup given we have a full 8-class course load to complete alongside managing this project. But don’t worry, once you get to know us, you will know we can do it.</p>

As we are gearing up for tooling and mass production, there is a small window of time between now and placing our final PO. We want to bring Transrover to the INDIEGOGO community so more golfer can benefit from this great invention. Additional funding raised from this campaign will help us place a larger PO which, in turn, will lower the unit costs. It will be a huge boost for us. We will be able to order additional units for our awaiting wholesalers and retailers. We hope to have your support and join our incredible journey. <strong>Indiegogo Special Discounts</strong> are offered to all backers.

</div></div>","With this very quesion, I set out to reinvent the ultimate bag from the ground up...with collapsible wheels and a pushbar, of course.My name is Thinh Tran from Elk Grove, California. And I invented the Transrover. My search for the elusive solution began on March 2010. It soon became my obsession. I worked on it every chance I got. Usually late at night...in my garage or backyard, hacking out concepts and prototypes with whatever random scraps I could get my hands on. Finally, after nearly 9 years of inventing and perfecting, my vision for Transrover has been realized. We are all set for mass production. I hope you enjoy learning about this incredible product as much as I did inventing it. More importantly, I hope to have your support as a backer and join me on my journey to bring Transrover to life. We are excited to be on Indiegogo. To all of you who believe in Transrover, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support. As we are gearing up for tooling and mass production, there is a small window of time between now and placing our final PO. We want to bring Transrover to the INDIEGOGO community so more golfer can benefit from this great invention. Additional funding raised from this campaign will help us place a larger PO which, in turn, will lower the unit costs. It will be a huge boost for us. We will be able to order additional units for our awaiting wholesalers and retailers. We hope to have your support and join our incredible journey. Indiegogo Special Discounts are offered to all backers. Be one of the very first to own a Transrover at these introductory rates. The next time you see a Transrover out on the course, take pride knowing you lent a helping hand in bringing it to life!

<p><span>ÓGRA  Peat Products are an innovative skincare solution formulated using natural peat. This powerhouse product contains dynamic phyto power evolved over thousands of years.</span><br/></p>
<p>The effectiveness of peat lies in its ability to help activate the skin’s natural regeneration process boosting the skin’s appearance resulting in skin that looks radiant and young and feels incredibly smooth to the touch. In addition the peat has superior anti- oxidant and moisturising properties helping maintain the health and youthfulness of the skin.  </p>
<p>Peat is nature's most powerful preserving product which has evolved over millennia with more than 1000 herbs, plants, grasses and flowers having decomposed into the waters forming a nutritious mud compound. Peat is one of the most powerful &amp; potent substances, containing a multitude of minerals, phyto nutrients and phyto chemicals. These are the driving force behind it's preserving abilities. Of particular importance are the virtually unknown humic &amp; fulvic acids. These are natural acids that penetrate the skin &amp; influence the enzymatic activity of the body.</p>

ÓGRA  Peat Products are an innovative skincare solution formulated using natural peat. This powerhouse product contains dynamic phyto power evolved over thousands of years.
The effectiveness of peat lies in its ability to help activate the skin’s natural regeneration process boosting the skin’s appearance resulting in skin that looks radiant and young and feels incredibly smooth to the touch. In addition the peat has superior anti- oxidant and moisturising properties helping maintain the health and youthfulness of the skin.  
Peat is nature's most powerful preserving product which has evolved over millennia with more than 1000 herbs, plants, grasses and flowers having decomposed into the waters forming a nutritious mud compound. Peat is one of the most powerful & potent substances, containing a multitude of minerals, phyto nutrients and phyto chemicals. These are the driving force behind it's preserving abilities. Of particular importance are the virtually unknown humic & fulvic acids. These are natural acids that penetrate the skin & influence the enzymatic activity of the body.

<p>We are a multi-disciplinary team creating a viable, professional internet basketball league that is owned by regular (non-rich) people. The experience will be similar to the billion-dollar ownership experience in that our owners will draft, pay, trade, cut and merchandise their players.</p>
<p>With the internet as our sole source of audience, we lose the need for in-person attendance and related expenses such as security, parking, increased insurance. And, we make pro sports team ownership affordable; we create a new class of professional athletes; we make jobs; we offer league-wide profit sharing so advertising dollars flow back to our owner-partners. Owners can have fun and have the potential to make money if they manage their team in the right way.</p>
<p>We almost sold this idea to a venture capitalist for $500,000 but the terms were terrible for us. Crowdfunding gives us the best chance to do it right.</p>
<p><strong>                                   What We Need the Money For</strong></p>
<p>Once up and running, our team-owner fees will cover most of our operating costs, including paying players, building construction. Our goal of a league with 4,000 owners per team with 15 teams and total fees of $125 per person builds an operating fund of $7.5 million. Ongoing advertising partnerships and fees are projected to cover additional costs.</p>
<p>We are asking for $25,000 as a downpayment to buy land on which we will build our league-specific building. The asking price is $90,000 and we will make the payments and raise the remaining funds to complete our building within a year. The site is located near Chicago, which has a high population of young men and women who play basketball, and it is easily accessible by all forms of transportation.</p>
<p>Our website is in the avanced design phase; our marketing/sales is further along than that. We have met with Fortune 500 clients to show them how their ad dollars would be effectively spent with us. Our missing link is a building specifically for this league and sport.</p>
<p>If we fall short of our goal, this money will go to either a cheaper tract of land or into marketing the idea with more angelic investors that will keep the idea in its current form.</p>

<p>My story:</p>
<p>I was born in Taipei,
Taiwan and moved to New Zealand with my family at the age of four. I grew up in
New Zealand and started playing golf around 10 years old. <br/>
In 2009, I traveled to the United States to play golf tournaments. One of which was
the Under Armour College Combines where I won both the stroke play event and
skills challenge. This international exposure proved rewarding. I was offered a
full four year golf scholarship to attend Pepperdine University and compete in
NCAA Division I college golf beginning the following year in August 2010.
Before I left for the states I competed for the New Zealand Junior Team in the
Trans Tasman Cup where we were victorious over Australia for the first time in
27 years. It has been a great four years playing for a top ranked NCAA Division
I University where I had the chance to travel to many different states and meet
people from all walks of life.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/970376/files/20141029211453-wccteam.jpg?1414642493"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>GAME is designed to be easy. Really easy. With the GAME product, you receive a GYG device and a set of club tags, one for each club in your bag. </p>
<p>Setup is simple—pop a tag onto each of your clubs and you are ready to go. When you're ready to play, put the GYG device on your belt and hit the course. Whenever you take a shot you just ""tag"" the club against the GYG on your hip and go.</p>
<p>With that, your game is completely recorded. Every shot. Seamlessly.</p>
<p>The GYG device is loaded with a combination of the latest sensor technology—GPS, NFC, compass, accelerometer, and a gyrometer—to capture all the important data in your game. Data is then uploaded via low power wireless or USB to the GAME platform.</p>

His surgery is scheduled for December 2012; the operation and recovery is going to drain the family, and I am hoping to help them raise enough money to get by in this tough time. Byron is from Ecuador where healthcare is limited and has to be completely funded by the patient. Although they have been told that the 17mm tumor is benign, it needs to be removed immediately to prevent gastrointestinal problems and eliminate future cancer worries.<br/><br/>From 2003-2004, I spent 4 months living in Ecuador with Byron and his family. They graciously hosted me, independent of a program, and without expecting anything in return. The head of the house (Byron's mother-in-law) is a certified nurse who works tirelessly for $100 a month, standard wages in Ecuador. This operation is expensive and will cause severe hardship for Byron and his family.</p>
<p>Byron runs an electronics store with his wife and 2 children. Byron's brother-in-law is a fisherman - he lives up stairs with his wife, his 3 children and his mother-in-law. The entire Macias family lives in one household, and they are bonding together to raise money for this operation. Let's bond together in support of the Macias family and help them meet the goal of $1500 to pay for this operation. Even a $5 contribution makes a world of difference in Ecuador. Please help me repay this family for all that they have done for me, and all the kindness they have offered others. For all the people who have been greeted with open arms while traveling abroad, now is the time to pay it back.</p></div>","I am running this campaign to help my good friend Byron Macias fund a medical procedure to have a colon tumor removed.

They graciously hosted me, independent of a program, and without expecting anything in return. The head of the house (Byron's mother-in-law) is a certified nurse who works tirelessly for $100 a month, standard wages in Ecuador. This operation is expensive and will cause severe hardship for Byron and his family.
Byron runs an electronics store with his wife and 2 children. Byron's brother-in-law is a fisherman - he lives up stairs with his wife, his 3 children and his mother-in-law. The entire Macias family lives in one household, and they are bonding together to raise money for this operation. Let's bond together in support of the Macias family and help them meet the goal of $1500 to pay for this operation. Even a $5 contribution makes a world of difference in Ecuador. Please help me repay this family for all that they have done for me, and all the kindness they have offered others. For all the people who have been greeted with open arms while traveling abroad, now is the time to pay it back.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

my professional career as a ski instructor. While working as a professional in
the ski industry, I strived to share my passion and love for the sport with all
those who surrounded me. By showing my clients that the “fun meter” must
always remain high, I feel like I helped them instill this same love and passion
that I have.  I had a lot of inspiring mentors throughout my career, and I
am motivated to be a positive role model to others the same way my mentors were
to me.  I strive to share my love for the great outdoors and my love for
skiing to my clients and co-workers.  I also try to share my
knowledge of how to transfer the skills from these sports to other areas in
their lives.  I make every effort to be a positive role model, showing the
public and coworkers that being a ski instructor is a valid professional
career.  I try to be a positive role model, leading by example by

which is known to be one of the hardest 100 mile endurance rides in the county. I also have dreams and plans to compete in many multi day
rides. </p>

<li>Hi my name is Ryan and I am an activist and have been to quite a few protests and recognize that the most effective protests are the ones where people that want to come can.</li>
<li>I constantly see and talk to people who wish they could come and have their voices be heard but financially are not able. I got the idea to get a transportation team started when I saw how effective it was used for the NATO protests in Chicago in May of 2012 where the Nurses Union paid for charter buses to help people who wanted to come but were financially unable to come. They were able to come and express themselves and in the United States the ability to stand up for what you believe in shouldn't be just for those with money.</li>
<li>Your donation no matter how big or small will be incredibly appreciated and unbelievably helpful to those willing to go and stand up against a government that no longer has the best interest of the people in mind. Instead they are funded and run by corporations with unlimited money and power. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; How it Helps</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking for enough money to fund some charter buses from a few major cities and assist some fellow trusted activists who are carpooling from less concentrated states and cities.</li>
<li>You will be able to follow the progress and and updates from our twitter @MMMtransSQUAD or contact us through email at MMMtransportSQUAD@gmail.com</li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal and cannot fund all the buses we want to then the money will go to funding as many as we can and/or helping as many people get to DC as we can as well as media costs.

We will tweet pics and shout outs with what your funds are going to. You will be kept in the loop every step of the way via twitter so rest assured your money will be put to good use.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>After seeing the effectiveness of transport coordination at the NATO summit and from contributors to the OCCUPY movement which led to occupiers being able to attend the DNC and RNC conventions we see it as essential to coordinate transport to give the maximum amount of people the chance to exercise their first amendment right as possible.</li>
<li>If we do not exercise our right to address our grievances with our government we will loose it.</li>

<h3>Help me get back to Haiti!</h3>
My name is Dawn Garzon and I am a pediatric nurse practitioner,. I made medical mission to Haiti in 2101 (two months after the earthquake) and fall of 2011. While there I help care for the children of Haiti. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, yet her people are full of hope and joy. I travel with a non-profit group called Mission Haiti. When there, our team of doctors, nurses and pharmacists sees hundreds of people over a one week period and provides medical care and medication for people who would otherwise have no access to healthcare. Due to personal reasons, I have been unable to visit Haiti since October, 2011. I will return in October of 2013.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope to riase $2100 to fund my daughter's (who is 16) and my return trip to Jubilee Haiti this Fall. Children often respond the best to other young people, so having my daughter at my side has the potential to pu many of these little ones at ease. I am committed to returning even if I don't make my fundraising goals. I will fund our own airfare and travel. The funds requested here cover the cost of our medical supplies, travel and lodging in Haiti, and employment of Haitian support staff. The cost of the trip is $1300 per person plus airfare, and additional supplies.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Each time I have visited Haiti, our team averaged 100+ patients each day. We provide medical care, medications and we bring reading glasses if we can get them. These are beautiful children and thier families have limited access to healthcare. Many have never seen a medical professional in thier life. Many children we see have extreme skin infections and intestinal parasites. Others have breathign problems, or acute infections that are commonplace in the US but can cause severe outcomes when antibiotics and ""routine"" are not readily available.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't help now, I ask for your prayers and positive thoughts. Pray for the team, but more importantly, pray for the people of Haiti. My life is more rich and more grounded becuase fo the people I know in Haiti. I am humbeled and honored to serve such a joyful population.</div></div>","Help me get back to Haiti!

<p><strong>About Hairy Jayne</strong></p>
<p>Hello! I'm a hairdresser who makes her own <strong>natural</strong> hair care range. My name is Jayne but I'm not actually hairy.</p>
<p>I've dealt with many a head of hair over about 12 years, tending to tresses of all shapes and sizes. I began experimenting with making natural hand made products after taking a few short courses in soap, candle and perfume making, and then realising I was becoming sensitive to an ingredient in black hair dye.</p>
<p>I brew, mix and package the products all by hand in my studio in Brixton – not in a factory – and the illustrated labels that embellish the bottles are also designed and created by me. (Once upon a time I was a graphic designer).</p>
<p>As well as being natural, the products have a certain nostalgic feel. All the ingredients have been chosen for their hair-friendly qualities. The shampoos are sulfate free as these are milder for dry scalps – perfect for sensitive souls – and the mildness is also colour protecting. Ingredients such as parabens and sulfates (SLS), which have been linked to allergies and skin irritations, have been left out just to be on the safe side. Production is eco-conscious, and all bottles and packaging can be easily recycled.</p>
<p>The range has been kept deliberately simple and is designed to be used in any combination with a choice of three unique, natural fragrances.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are two shampoos, three conditioners and three hair perfumes. I hope to develop and launch more products in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because so far I have managed to fund all of the research, development and prototyping myself – but have now hit a few new bigger obstacles at this stage of the game.</p>
<p>There are changes to the <strong>cosmetic legislation</strong> framework in Europe which will be fully implemented by July 2013, so all of my formulations need to be <strong>retested</strong> by an approved cosmetic chemist before then for the products to be legally sold. </p>
<p>As the labels will need to be changed and re-printed, this is the perfect time for me to address a few issues with the packaging of the products. After testing the waters and listening to customer suggestions and focus groups, I have come up with some <strong>new designs</strong> which look much smarter and more suitable for gracing the shelves of salons and shops!</p>
<p><strong>What Hairy Jayne needs </strong></p>
<p>So my costs are:</p>
<p>retesting     1200<br/><br/>relabelling   700</p>
<p>bulk buying   800</p>
<p>(bottles &amp; ingredients)</p>
<p>branding     500</p>
<p>= £3200</p>
<p>If you can help me raise this funding, you'll get a 'perk' in return! </p>
<p>If the goal isn't reached, all money is refunded. And sadly I go back to the drawing board!</p>
<p><strong>What are Perks?</strong></p>
<p>As well as the chance to buy Hairy Jayne products in shops, have happy hair that you love and that loves you back and get a HUGE thank you from me – your contributions will earn perks or <strong>rewards</strong>. They're listed in the panel on the right.</p>
<p>If the perks aren't quite up your street, they make <strong>excellent gifts</strong> for someone else. The PAGEBOY and QUIFF can be sent overseas, so if you're not in the UK I'd recommend those. All contributions from within the UK will include shipping for the perks.</p>
<p>If you like you can just contribute to the campaign without the perks, knowing that you've helped an independent British enterprise get off the ground.</p>
<p>Any contributions to this growing obsession of mine would make me so unbelievably <strong>happy</strong> and leave me feeling so incredibly <strong>grateful</strong> forever and ever. Anyone who has spoken with me at all in the past year or so will tell you how much work I've put in to this product range and how much this all means to me! (It's pretty much all I ever talk about). My aim is to create a brand of good quality natural hair care which is professional but not overly expensive. More like everyday luxury – and you can get yourself a piece of that!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you just stretch to contributing, that doesn’t mean you can’t help out!</p>
<p>Please get the word out and make some noise if you can. <strong>Tweet, share and forward</strong> to as many people as you wish, especially if the video amuses you. Thanks so much! </p>

As well as being natural, the products have a certain nostalgic feel. All the ingredients have been chosen for their hair-friendly qualities. The shampoos are sulfate free as these are milder for dry scalps – perfect for sensitive souls – and the mildness is also colour protecting. Ingredients such as parabens and sulfates (SLS), which have been linked to allergies and skin irritations, have been left out just to be on the safe side. Production is eco-conscious, and all bottles and packaging can be easily recycled.
The range has been kept deliberately simple and is designed to be used in any combination with a choice of three unique, natural fragrances.
At the moment, there are two shampoos, three conditioners and three hair perfumes. I hope to develop and launch more products in the future.
Why am I doing this?
This campaign is important to me because so far I have managed to fund all of the research, development and prototyping myself – but have now hit a few new bigger obstacles at this stage of the game.
There are changes to the cosmetic legislation framework in Europe which will be fully implemented by July 2013, so all of my formulations need to be retested by an approved cosmetic chemist before then for the products to be legally sold. 
As the labels will need to be changed and re-printed, this is the perfect time for me to address a few issues with the packaging of the products. After testing the waters and listening to customer suggestions and focus groups, I have come up with some new designs which look much smarter and more suitable for gracing the shelves of salons and shops!
What Hairy Jayne needs 
So my costs are:
retesting     1200relabelling   700
bulk buying   800
(bottles & ingredients)
branding     500
= £3200
If you can help me raise this funding, you'll get a 'perk' in return! 
If the goal isn't reached, all money is refunded. And sadly I go back to the drawing board!
What are Perks?
As well as the chance to buy Hairy Jayne products in shops, have happy hair that you love and that loves you back and get a HUGE thank you from me – your contributions will earn perks or rewards. They're listed in the panel on the right.
If the perks aren't quite up your street, they make excellent gifts for someone else. The PAGEBOY and QUIFF can be sent overseas, so if you're not in the UK I'd recommend those. All contributions from within the UK will include shipping for the perks.
If you like you can just contribute to the campaign without the perks, knowing that you've helped an independent British enterprise get off the ground.
Any contributions to this growing obsession of mine would make me so unbelievably happy and leave me feeling so incredibly grateful forever and ever. Anyone who has spoken with me at all in the past year or so will tell you how much work I've put in to this product range and how much this all means to me! (It's pretty much all I ever talk about). My aim is to create a brand of good quality natural hair care which is professional but not overly expensive. More like everyday luxury – and you can get yourself a piece of that!

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Kayode Ariran ( AKA ""Kay Bizzy"" - as he is known to his friends because he is always busy ), is a key figure in his local community.  </p>
<p>It was a youngster asking him ""so what have you given back to your community"" that really made Kayode think, and then decide that he would make ""giving back"" to the community that shaped him, his main objective in life..... </p>
<p>.....So he started a movement and called it: The <strong>Give Back Family.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Give Back Family </strong></p>
<p>Kayode intends to make ""Giving Back"" the new buzz word, and intends to spread the world via the <strong><a href=""http://www.givebackfamily.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Give Back Family"">Give Back Family</a></strong> website.</p>
<p>Being an ex gang member and coming so close to choosing the wrong path in life, with the odds stacked against him,  Kayode managed to somehow turn his life around. He now aims to do all that he can to help to ensure that the local youth learn from his mistakes instead of making their own.</p>
<p>Kayode's background means that local youngsters, and even current gang members can identify with him and where he has come from - much better than they could a ""pencil pushing"" guy in a suit!</p>
<p>Still being a key figure in his local community, kayode also takes the time to give back by talking to and mentoring current young gang members and trying to help them to distance themselves from gangs and a life of crime.</p>
<p>The initials of the <strong>Give Back Family</strong> ( GBF ) also stand as an acronym for the Great Brixton Fc.</p>
<h3>The Parachute Jump </h3>
<p>On the 18th of August 2013, Kayode Ariran will travel to Reading in the United Kingdom to take part in a sponsored Parachute jump. The jump aims to raise funds for 3 main purposes:</p>
<p>1. Children in foster care.</p>
<p>2. For the <strong>Give Back Family Foundation</strong> ( Founded by Kayode Ariran )</p>
<p>3. Start Great Brixton FC ( football club for the youth and local residents of Brixton )</p>
<p>The total target for funds to raise is a modest £40,000. Although of course this will not be enough to acheive all of our objectives, it will be enough to at least get the ball rolling, and make a make a substancial donation to his charity. </p>
<h3>Why funds are required</h3>
<p>Fnding received from this campaign will be split between Kays chosen charity and his community projects.</p>
<p>The allocation of funds will be as follows:</p>

<p>Carmen was involved in a head-on collision on Airport Road in Martinsburg, WV at 8pm on Wednesday, May 16, 2012. Her injuries were so severe that she was airlifted to the trauma center at Inova Fairfax Hospital for children, 2 hours away.</p>
<p>Carmen arrived at the hospital with a fractured cheek bone, a fractured spine, and severe internal abdominal injuries. She was rushed into emergency surgery, and also received a blood transfusion due to the extent of internal bleeding. Over the next four weeks, she underwent six abdominal surgeries to remove damaged intestines and repair a badly damaged pancreas.  During that same time period she had one spinal surgery, at which time additional damage was discovered.  In addition to the broken bones, she had two badly damaged ligaments and spinal fluid was discovered to be leaking. She was moved from Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) about a week after her arrival, only to be rushed back to PICU a day later, with doctors working frantically to keep her alive as her body was unable to fight off the infection that had set in. The additional surgery that was needed had to wait until her fragile little body was up to it. When she became stable enough, they removed additional sections of her intestines severely damaged from the infection, and she remained on a ventilator for several days. She began physical therapy during her third week, and was able to walk short distances with a walker when she was released from the hospital on Thursday, June 14<sup>th</sup>. However, on June 18<sup>th</sup>, her home health care nurse advised Carmen’s mother that she believed the incision on her back had become infected. This meant a trip back to Inova Fairfax Hospital for Children, where Carmen underwent the second surgery on her back, making a total of 8 surgeries. At the time of starting this campaign, Carmen remains at the hospital.  Cultures have determined that the infection is a staph infection.  She had a PICC line inserted and has begun I.V antibiotic treatment, but cannot be released until they have determined that the level being administered is strong enough to treat the infection, while not too strong, which would cause additional problems.</p>
<p> Because of the severe internal injuries, numerous surgeries and subsequent infection, Carmen was unable to eat for the first three weeks of her hospital stay.  The badly damaged pancreas resulted in a severe case of pancreatitis, which still persists, causing her great pain after only a couple of bites of anything.  The surgery for the internal injuries delayed any surgery on her spinal injury, which required that she wear a neck collar until she could receive the spinal surgery.  The additional damage found when she finally had her spinal surgery required a “patch” to repair the area where the spinal fluid was leaking and required that she lay flat on her back for two weeks to allow the patch to heal and hold.  When she was finally able to wear the back brace she was fitted for, it proved to be a very painful ordeal.  Now, the infection that has developed in her back (which has reached the bones), will delay her physical therapy further and require that she remain on bed rest for several more weeks.</p>
<p>Through all of this, Carmen has remained in good spirits and the only time she has really complained or cried was when she had to wear the back brace, which we have learned actually contributed to the spread of the infection, and was causing intense pain on her incision.  She has been a source of inspiration to all who have come in contact with her.</p>
<p>During this entire time, Carmen’s mother, Niki, has not left Carmen’s side any longer than it takes her to shower and grab a bit to eat.  This has caused a great financial burden to their family, as their largest source of income has come to an abrupt halt.  In addition, the hospital is two hours away, which has increased the expenses (gas and meals) so that Carmen’s step-father can continue to work, yet visit as often as possible.  Carmen also has a little sister, 3-year old Calissa, who Carmen misses greatly. </p>
<p>As the day approached for Carmen to be released from the hospital initially, family and friends worked frantically to move the household from a two-story rental home to a single-level home, required for Carmen’s mobility in her wheelchair and walker.  This, too, has placed an additional financial burden on the family.</p>
<p>We are hoping to help Carmen and her family receive the financial assistance they need during this very difficult time.  The money raised will be used for many purposes – Carmen’s enormous medical bills, her extended therapy and medical care which will require a home healthcare nurse and physical therapist, travel expenses back and forth to Fairfax for follow up visits, household expenses (utilities, groceries, gas, etc.) which have all increased as the family’s income has decreased.</p>
<p>Please help us raise funds to assist Carmen and her family throughout her road to recovery. A donation in any amount, no matter how big or how small, would be greatly appreciated! Please help spread the word! We are sincerely grateful for your support!!!</p>

Impact is what we're all about. People haven't made things in Detroit in years and we're going to change that. Also, food is happiness and can make people smile. Smiles are what change attitudes. Attitudes can move mountains or even revive cities.
I've been part of large marketing and PR campaigns with Fortune 500 companies that can help me steer the course of thie project correctly. Finding the right partners will be key to success and I have the network to do that.

I am a Michigan boy trying to do something awesome right here at home. Give me a hand will ya?

<h3>Last month we raised almost $4000 for Naing Lin Oo to have heart surgery in Burma. Now we're asking for help with post-surgery recovery, which is every bit as critical. </h3>
<ul>
<li>Please note, the amount requested is the minimum of what we need. Should we reach our goal we will keep accepting donations for Naing Lin Oo's continuing medical care, which will surely be needed in the future!</li>
</ul>
<p class=""_mce_tagged_br"">My name is Karen Zusman and last month i launched a campaign to help me raise funds for a boy in Burma who i became friends with last Fall. Naing Lin Oo is a villager from the ancient, sacred city of Bagan. He was born with a heart defect that required a procedure called a VSD. Without the procedure he would probably not make it past his 20th birthday.</p>
<p>The good news is that we raised the money and organized the surgery for him! The surgery was performed on February 20, from 9am-2 pm and it was considered a success. While we are thrilled and relieved to say the least, we are not out of the woods yet. <strong>Which is why i am asking once again for help.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we underestimated the amount of money we needed because in Burma there is no fixed price and patients are at the mercy of the doctors, staff and government as Yangon General, where the surgery was performed, is a state-run hospital. Poor conditions and unconventional payment structures to say the least.</p>
<p>The money we raised went to doctor's visits, blood, x-rays, an expensive and invasive assessment in Mandalay prior to surgery to confirm surgery was still an option, transportation from yangon to mandalay to get this assessment and back to yangon for the confirmation and procedure itself. once the payment for the actual surgery was needed we were several hundred dollars short. Luckily a friend in Burma fronted the money. We need to reimburse her and we need to pay for reccovery ($700 in each case).</p>
<p><strong>Currently, Naing Lin Oo is in intensive care unit.</strong> The campaign photo was taken 2 days after surgery and as you can see, the conditions in ICU are not what you would expect. He has no mattress, no blanket, not a proper pillow, and only a cloth cushion to rest over his chest to prevent infection. But most importantly, the hospital in general is a very risky place to recover.</p>
<p><strong>Naing Lin Oo's immunity is severly compromised from the surgery and we need to secure a safe, clean place near the hospital for him and his parents to stay in for the next few weeks while he recovers.</strong> We also need to pay for subsequent medical follow-up treatment, including doctor's visits and medicines and anything else he should need during this time. </p>
<p><strong>Please donate whatever you can no matter how small.</strong> it all adds up. Thanks to your generosity we were able to secure heart surgery for Naing Lin Oo. He is a very brave boy to have gone through that and we can't turn our back on him now! </p>

<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>My name is Karen Zusman and I'm a multi-media journalist and for many years I have been covering issues related to the people of Burma (<a href=""http://www.pleasedontsaymyname.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.pleasedontsaymyname.org</a>).</p>
<p>Recently I returned to Burma to see for myself what changes were underway since Aung San Suu Kyi was elected to parliament. During my stay, I met a lovely man named Kyaw Myint and his family in Bagan, the ancient, sacred city. I spent the day riding in his horsecart accompanied by his 13-year old son, Naing Lin Oo. And this is the reason why I'm writing to you.</p>
<p><strong>Naing Lin needs heart surgery.</strong> He has a condition that essentially means one of the valves of his heart does not close properly and as a result he coughs up blood and on occasion, blood fills his lungs. This condition will get worse as he grows older. And surgery will also be more difficult and dangerous for him with each passing year. Now is the time for Naing Lin to have his procedure. </p>
<p>I promised Naing Lin's father i would do what i could to make sure they can keep their appointment for surgery on Februrary 7. I will be sending the money directly to the hospital--Yangon General--in Burma. I have friends in Yangon who will check on Naing Lin after the surgery, and I will be visiting later in the year to check on him as well. </p>
<p>We need $3500 in total to cover all immediate costs associated with the surgery. About half that amount funds the procedure itself and the other half will be used to buy 9 bottles of blood and all the necessary medicines--in Burma, patients must pay for these things themselves--as well as pay for a shared room with 3 other patients for Naing Lin and his father for one month after the surgery. Because conditions in Burma are difficult, it is absolutely necessary that Naing Lin stay in hospital care for this time to ensure a healthy recovery.</p>
<p>The procedure will be performed in the Cardiac unit by a team that includes one Burmese surgeon and one visiting foreign surgeon--we were told this doctor will be from either Korea or New Zealand. </p>
<p>If the money does not reach the hospital by the day before the surgery, Naing Lin will lose his spot and have to wait another year--providing they can raise the money. This has already happened to them once. I do not want this boy to be turned away a second time! </p>
<p>Any amount over our goal will be saved in a fund to support further medical care for Naing Lin post-surgery.</p>
<p>I have chosen the Indigogo account that allows me to keep whatever I raise minus 9% should we not reach our goal. If we reach our goal, I will be charged only 4%. </p>
<p>I have already raised !,000 from a few lovely friends and now I am reaching out to a wider circle of friends and friends of friends. Or anyone with a heart for Burma. </p>
<p>Many of you who know me know i am connected with a few other, larger projects related to Burma and Burmese refugees. But this one touches me greatly because it is so readily do-able and will have such a great impact on one very special boy who i had the joy of getting to know during my time in Bagan. </p>
<p>Any amount will help us reach our goal. It all adds up! But if you are able to give a bit more I have organized a few gifts of appreciation in the ""perks"" section. And if you live in the NYC area, i will be hosting a private house concert with legendary jazz guitarist, Gene Bertoncini, jazz guitar virtuoso Paul Meyers, and tabla extraordinaire Bill Buchen. This party will be a benefit to raise money for the surgery and post-surgery as well. Since it is in my home, space is quite limited, but if you are interested in joining us for a night of exquisite music one evening toward the end of January, please read about it in the ""perks"" section. </p>
<p>I know times are hard and it seems whenever we check email someone is asking us for something. If you are not able to help monetarily but feel so moved, please pass this campaign link on to a friend who may be interested and able to help one of the most lovely boys in the world. We thank you. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Johns Hopkins Quidditch team was formed the spring of 2010. Since then we've become a campus-wide presence, competing in and hosting multiple tournaments.

<h3>Lucas' Story</h3>
<p>Lucas Hiram Massman was born 6 weeks prematurely on July 21, 2011. Lucas' mother, Teresa Veltkamp, died the next day due to a brain aneurysm. Lucas' father Jake is now caring for his newborn son without his partner who so very much wanted a child. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Teresa and Jake married a year ago, but have known each other almost their whole lives. They dated for several years when they were younger and then separated, but remained very close. As life moved on for both for both of them, they realized that they were made for each other. They began to plan a wedding and a family and life was just as it should have been. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Seven months into Teresa's pregnancy things took a terrible turn. Now Teresa has left us and Jake will have to learn how to balance they joy of Lucas with the sadness of losing Teresa. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Anyone who knows Jake and Teresa can tell you that they are two of the kindest, most loving people you would ever meet. Lots of people say that about lots of people...but it's true for them. The two of them have shown time and time again that they are people of incredible character and integrity. They have amassed an incredible amount of goodwill individually and together. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A fund has been set up at a Montana local bank for Lucas and Jake to help with the incredible costs of hospital care for both Teresa and Lucas, as well as Jake's need to be with Lucas, Teresa's funeral and estate as well as the Veltkamp-Massman family relying now on only one income. This Indiegogo site is intended to make it as easy as possible for people who wish to do so to help support Jake and Lucas as they get on their feet. Anyone with a credit card or a paypal account or a checkbook can use Indiegogo to donate. Indiegogo take a small percentage to administrate but more than 90% of the funds raised go directly to Jake and Lucas. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>UPDATE for LUCAS:</p>
<p>Lucas is still in the NICU as of 8/2/11 but is doing very well and should be able to be moved to the regular nursery in the hospital soon. Jake is there for Lucas' feedings and the two are bonding beautifully. Jake and Lucas are blessed with an incredibly strong support system of family and friends and there is no shortage of vistors and well-wishers for both of them. </p>

</div></div>","Lucas' Story
Lucas Hiram Massman was born 6 weeks prematurely on July 21, 2011. Lucas' mother, Teresa Veltkamp, died the next day due to a brain aneurysm. Lucas' father Jake is now caring for his newborn son without his partner who so very much wanted a child. 

Teresa and Jake married a year ago, but have known each other almost their whole lives. They dated for several years when they were younger and then separated, but remained very close. As life moved on for both for both of them, they realized that they were made for each other. They began to plan a wedding and a family and life was just as it should have been. 

Seven months into Teresa's pregnancy things took a terrible turn. Now Teresa has left us and Jake will have to learn how to balance they joy of Lucas with the sadness of losing Teresa. 

Anyone who knows Jake and Teresa can tell you that they are two of the kindest, most loving people you would ever meet. Lots of people say that about lots of people...but it's true for them. The two of them have shown time and time again that they are people of incredible character and integrity. They have amassed an incredible amount of goodwill individually and together. 

A fund has been set up at a Montana local bank for Lucas and Jake to help with the incredible costs of hospital care for both Teresa and Lucas, as well as Jake's need to be with Lucas, Teresa's funeral and estate as well as the Veltkamp-Massman family relying now on only one income. This Indiegogo site is intended to make it as easy as possible for people who wish to do so to help support Jake and Lucas as they get on their feet. Anyone with a credit card or a paypal account or a checkbook can use Indiegogo to donate. Indiegogo take a small percentage to administrate but more than 90% of the funds raised go directly to Jake and Lucas. 

UPDATE for LUCAS:
Lucas is still in the NICU as of 8/2/11 but is doing very well and should be able to be moved to the regular nursery in the hospital soon. Jake is there for Lucas' feedings and the two are bonding beautifully. Jake and Lucas are blessed with an incredibly strong support system of family and friends and there is no shortage of vistors and well-wishers for both of them.

Thank you,

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Laura Richard. Im a mother of three children ages 11, 8 and 4. Im also a wife to my husband Chris of 12yrs. Our story begins when I was 15 years old. I found out I had a rare bone problem in each of my feet called Tarsal Colition. Basically 3 main bones in my feet were fused together, this happens in utero. However I had surgery to correct this dis order. Since then the surgery was successful in my right, but not for my left. I've been having serial castings done to help ease the pain. Now 15 years later, I was told I need another surgery in my left foot to help with pain and correct the new problem. The surgery is called a Triple Arthrodesis. It consist of many screws and bone staples. However we have one set back. I do not have insurance. My husband makes too much money for any state help. I was denied Private/Independant insurance due to a pre exsisting condition and my height to weight proportion was too bad. My husband's work insurance will insure me but that makes our monthly payment jump from 120.00 every two weeks to 665.00 every two weeks. Unfortunately that is just way too much money to have taken out. We fall into the ""middle"" class catergory, just the way it is I suppose.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I do not receive this surgery, I will continue to be in major pain. As it is I can not play with my kids, grocery shop or even stand to do the dinner dishes without being in massive pain. Without correction my knee, hip and back will also continue to deteriorate. There is a high chance from my ankle down could be amputated. Im only 30yrs old and want to be there more for my kids. I already feel like im lacking. They always want to do this or that and I just can't, no matter how hard I push myself. Im tired of my kids having to see their Mommy in pain. It also takes a toll on personal health as well as a marriage.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need 3500.00 dollars to use as the down payment to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, CA. They agreed to make payment arrangements with me after that down payment. They will not even schedule the surgery until they receive that money. You will be making a dream come true for me and a big weight off of my family shoulders. A chance for a family to be a family again.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If times are hard for you as they are for me, no need to worry you can always share this on facebook, myspace or any other site you are on. You can even email to friends and family. I/we thank you for any help. Thank you for your time and help.</p>

<p> Now it’s time to activate my name on the transplant list.  My primary insurance is Medicare and my secondary insurance Is AVMED.   I have been on Mayo’s transplant list for eight years.  The major holdback in activating my name is that Mayo transplant unit wants me to have money saved up in the bank for medications and emergencies. The minimum amount of money needed is $10,000, this money I do not have.</p>
<p>The transplant social worker asked me to have a close relative to come and take care of me for three months after the operation.  Both my sisters are sicker than I am, and my brother has Parkinson’s disease.  There has been a couple who I have been friends with for fifteen years who are willing to move in for the three months of care.  She was a registered nurse and would take care of my food and medications while her husband would take care of the house repairs, lawn, and car repairs. </p>
<p>My hopes are to get the transplant, get my strength back, and get my color back.  As the economy comes back, I will be coming back too.</p>

<p> </p></div>","My name is Charlene Montague.  I am an adult disabled retiree of the state of Florida.  Three days a week, I have hemo-dialysis at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.  In 2002 I had a kidney transplant but it failed two years later.  Since I was the only parent to my young son, I waited for him to graduate high school before again activating my name on the transplant list.  He graduated high school this year and has a scholarship to college.  I feel I did right by him.
 Now it’s time to activate my name on the transplant list.  My primary insurance is Medicare and my secondary insurance Is AVMED.   I have been on Mayo’s transplant list for eight years.  The major holdback in activating my name is that Mayo transplant unit wants me to have money saved up in the bank for medications and emergencies. The minimum amount of money needed is $10,000, this money I do not have.
The transplant social worker asked me to have a close relative to come and take care of me for three months after the operation.  Both my sisters are sicker than I am, and my brother has Parkinson’s disease.  There has been a couple who I have been friends with for fifteen years who are willing to move in for the three months of care.  She was a registered nurse and would take care of my food and medications while her husband would take care of the house repairs, lawn, and car repairs. 
My hopes are to get the transplant, get my strength back, and get my color back.  As the economy comes back, I will be coming back too.
Enough money may not be raised before the time this listing runs out, but every generous donation will help.  My address is 2934 Stonehurst Rd W, Jacksonville, Florida 32277.  Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I first met Asha, Nitin’s mother, when visiting my father in
India twenty years ago. She was working in the building where my father lives
and was always positive and smiling. </p>
<p>Asha lives with her two sons in one room in south Mumbai.
She works for several different families, twelve hours a day, seven days a
week, rushing from one building to another, preparing meals, cleaning floors,
washing clothes and ironing. Even when suffering from a fever or, once, from a
knee so badly swollen she could hardly walk, still she kept working and
smiling. </p>
<p>‘I want a better life for my sons,’ she told me.  Unable to read and write herself, she has
managed to pay for both her sons to attend private schools and then get them
into one of the oldest and most reputable colleges in Mumbai. </p>
<p>Asha earns about Rs.20,000 (£200) a month. She hoards every
penny to pay for her sons’ education, and with no social benefits, free health
care or pension to look forward to, saves a little for her old age.  She
buys gold, a bangle here, a bangle there, the age old insurance policy of the
poor.<br/></p><p>No one with such a mother could fail to be inspired by her
selflessness and as soon as he was old enough, Nitin, her older boy, got a job
in a gym to help out with his college fees. After studying long hours and
getting an excellent degree in Economics, Nitin landed a job in a bank. When he
told Asha, whose health was suffering from her relentless hard labour, he said,
‘Now you no longer need to work so hard. Now you can rest.’ </p>
<p>Shortly after starting work Nitin began to have pains in his
chest. Four months later, after extensive tests, including several very
expensive scans and a biopsy, he was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma. He is
23. </p>
<p>Asha cried as she told me, ‘Poor boy, I never let him rest.
I was always saying, “You must work, you must study.” He never had a chance to
enjoy himself. And what was it all for? Now I say to Deepak (her younger son
who is also in college), don’t work so hard, enjoy yourself.’</p>
<p><b>What Nitin Needs</b></p>
<p>The doctors say Nitin has a 95% chance of recovery provided
he can have the prescribed treatment of eighteen sessions of chemotherapy. But
each session averages around Rs. 20,000 (£200). Nitin has undergone six so far and has
had a severe reaction to them, losing his hair, feeling extreme nausea and
being unable to eat, despite Asha buying and cooking special food for him. The
doctors have said a port in his chest to feed the chemo directly to the cancer
site would cost Rs 50,000 (£500), which Asha cannot afford. The hospital has
also said that he should be kept in hospital in a separate room after each
chemo session as his immune system is so weak he is prone to infection, but
Asha cannot afford to pay for a room so Nitin has to return to their one room in
a crowded tenement. </p>
<p>Asha has already used all her savings and has now sold her
gold jewellery, her last defence against destitution. Money has run out for
Nitin’s remaining treatment.</p>
<p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>I have donated £1300, which is all I can afford at the
moment. </p>
<p>The additional sum of money that Asha needs to find to cover
Nitin’s treatment, the port into his chest and the recovery room – is about Rs
350,000 rupees. An enormous sum in India, well beyond the reach of all but the
wealthy, in English money it is equivalent to £3500 - not a lot to save
someone’s life. </p>
<p>If you can afford and you are moved to give something to
help Asha and Nitin, even a small amount - £5 or £10 - can go a long way in
India. It would pay for several taxi trips to hospital or special food that he
can stomach when nauseous to help him keep his strength up. It would also allow
Asha to spend more time looking after him, instead of being out working all
day. You can adjust the default amount (set by Indiegogo) in the box by deleting and typing in your own amount. <br/></p>
<p>£3500 is the minimum that Nitin needs. All money raised will go to cover the full cost of his treatment. Any extra money
raised will go towards further treatment if required, or to help others in
India in a similar position.</p>
<p>Please help if you can. If you can’t afford to donate,

</p><p><b>What
is the The 360° Approach?</b></p>
<p>The 360° Approach is a boutique personal training and fitness
studio focusing on total body wellness. 
360°
takes a personalized approach to working with individuals and small groups,
designing wellness plans that address fitness, nutrition and self-care.  360° also works in schools and churches to create
wellness programs that build self-esteem and awaken self-awareness. </p>
<p><b>Who
is The 360° Approach?</b></p>
<p>In
2013 Chan Little started The 360° Approach as a way to support individuals in achieving
optimal health – no matter where they were on their journey.<span>  Since its inception, The </span>360° Approach has developed a diverse
clientele of professionals, athletes, students and retirees, providing clients
with personalized fitness plans and nutrition coaching.<span>  With </span>more than 15 years of
experience in health and wellness, Chan is a veteran of the U.S Air Force. In
2007 she joined the wellness team of the Durham YMCA and later became the
Director of Wellness, serving a membership base of more than 12,000. In her role as Director of
Wellness, she supported more
than 60 part time group fitness instructors and personal trainers; coordinated
more than 100 classes per week and managed community wellness programs that
addressed obesity and chronic illness through nutrition, fitness and self-care.
Under Chan’s leadership, The
360°
Approach offers diverse
group fitness classes, small group training, personal training and nutrition
counseling by an equally diverse community of certified personal trainers and
health professionals.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Why
<strong>360°</strong>?</b></p>
<p>Each year,
millions of people die from preventable deaths. A recent study showed that about
half of all deaths in the United States were due mostly to preventable
behaviors. Some of the leading causes included cardiovascular disease, chronic
respiratory disease and diabetes. This same study estimates that over 400,000
people die each year in the United States due to poor diet and a sedentary
lifestyle.</p>
<p>The 360° Approach recognizes the need for
change and understands that optimal health is only achieved with self-awareness,
support and proper balance. 360° supports individuals and communities through education, health promotion and
support of non-clinical life choices, such as, eating nutritious meals and
exercising daily, which both prevent disease and create a sense of overall
well-being. </p>
<p><b>What
we need?</b></p>
<p>For the past year, The 360° Approach has been operating
without a place to truly call home. As our community continues to grow, so does
the need for a dedicated studio space, conducive to creating and serving a diverse
community of people.  The 360° Approach will be designed as a boutique
studio, located in the heart of downtown Durham.  360° will offer an urban flare in a plush environment, with quality instructors,
innovative training approaches and lively music. </p>
<p>Our goal of
$37,959 has been properly calculated and will be used to renovate, equip, and
furnish our space in Downtown Durham. </p>
<p><b>How
you can help?</b></p>
<p>We believe there
are a lot of people out there like us, who want to impact our community in a meaningful
way. When we improve our quality of life and support others in doing so, we contribute
to a healthier community in which we can all work and live. Make your best donation
to the cause and we’ll offer you some pretty impressive perks in return.<span>  THEN… tell all your friends about our project
and how you’re helping to make Durham a healthier place to live by posting on
Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. 
We can’t do this without you!  If you’re
excited about what we’re doing in our community, please tell someone!</span>Thanks

<p><strong>Pelvic Liberation</strong></p>
<p>Cultivating Awareness for a Happy Healthy Pelvis</p>
<p>Self-Inquiry, Pelvic Floor YogaTM and Whole Body Breathing</p>
<p>Using yoga, breathing techniques, self inquiry and a big dash of humor, Leslie brings a thoughtful, thorough and therapeutic focus to a subject that can be difficult and overwhelming.  </p>
<p>This book was written as a call to normalize the conversation about pelvic health and improve women’s knowledge and awareness of their pelvis.  Leslie’s hope is to shine light on a subject shrouded in darkness and misunderstanding and illuminate the beauty and magic of this rich place. She also asks the reader to consider cultural and historical effects on women’s health in general.  </p>
<p>To this end, my book includes detailed explanations of key yoga postures and breathing practices designed to awaken and heal the female pelvis. A system that she calls Pelvic Floor YogaTM  After nearly five years, the book is almost complete. The writing, content development, editing, artwork and cover design, unique illustrations and yoga asana renderings (take a peek at a few of them in the gallery) are finished.  Ahead is design layout, final proofreading and printing. Publication date is just around the corner: November 2017.</p>
<p>Become a backer of this campaign and you will be first in line to get your hands on this book! You can help make this happen, and I need and value your support.</p>
<p>Already, the Pelvic Liberation message has reached thousands of women and professionals. Trainings are in demand around the world, and Pelvic Floor YogaTM online education has been viewed in 20 countries. This book is eagerly awaited by those who are already part of the “Pelvic Liberation”.</p>
<p>Every woman, yoga instructor and women’s health professional will benefit from the compelling blend to heal through recognition of personal history, body posture, healthy breathing, and strengthening, stabilizing, stretching and releasing yoga postures.  </p>
<p>Self-publishing ensures creative control and a collaborative process between author, editors, content director, illustrator, photographer and designer. The complex and elegant design and unique illustrations are considerable and requires attention to detail by a skilled designer who really embraces the vision. You will be pleased with the look and feel of this book; what a joy it is to see it come to life in the way I envisioned.</p>
<p> Leslie Howard has been a student and teacher of yoga and breathing practices for over twenty years and has logged over 3500 hours of study on the subject.  In 2004 she experienced debilitating pelvic pain and began her investigation into self healing.  Her journey caused reflections on the hows and the whys of her pain and her yoga practice provided many of the answers.  This book outlines her findings of the cultural, medical and societal contributors to women’s pelvic health and offers yoga and breathing techniques to alleviate many of the most common issues.  She was contacted by University of California, San Francisco in 2012 to design a yoga study for incontinence with acclaimed yoga teacher, Judith Lasater that resulted in a 70% decrease in symptoms in six weeks.  In 2013, another study Yoga for Pelvic Pain at UCSF merited a 42% decrease in pelvic pain in six weeks.  She teaches workshops and teacher trainings for therapeutic application of yoga for pelvic floor disorders worldwide.  Her primary yoga teachers have been Ramanand Patel, Manouso Manos and Patricia Walden.  She is a certified yoga therapist with the International Association of Yoga Therapists and a continuing education provider for Yoga Alliance.</p>

Standard Hydro off the ground. We believe in a new way of doing agriculture and
changing the status quo to improve people’s lives. But before we can do any of
that we need to raise the initial funds to build another shade house and start

<p></p>For years, St. Kitts has faced problems with economic diversification, adaptation to climate change and food security.

GVS's first members, Josefina, suffered from an eye problem that left her
almost completely blind. Unable to get the treatment she desperately needed in
her home country of Mexico, she traveled to the United States and found the
surgery she required. Unfortunately her eye problems did not end there, and she
soon found her vision in trouble once again. </span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">When
she walked into Grameen VidaSana for the first time, she was looking for
a mammogram. What she found instead was a complete and comprehensive
primary care program that would ultimately provide her with free eyeglasses,
help with managing her diabetes, and a mammogram referral at no additional cost. </span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Today,
after only two months, Josefina has changed her life drastically for the
better. She now takes the stairs at every chance, eats much healthier, visits
the program regularly for both doctor visits and to utilize the community space
(making her lunch in the practice's kitchen since her current job has no
facilities), and is even inspiring her health coaches to make changes in their
own habits. Although she was originally reluctant to join the program, as she
did not understand the need for regular check-ins since she wasn't sick every
day, she is now one of GVS's biggest advocates.</span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Amazingly,
Grameen VidaSana has changed her life in another way as well: on one of her
regular visits to the practice, she ran into the brother she had not seen in
almost 15 years, since they were separated during their migration process to
the United States - his wife was visiting GVS for her own appointment!</span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Josefina
is so grateful to all of the GVS staff and supporters, calling them
""angels."" By providing this type of care to women who do not have
access to it, we are improving the lives of so many.<br/><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>What We Need</b></span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">While
GVS is able to offer our members a comprehensive enhanced primary care program,
as well as referrals to numerous specialty care providers, we do not yet have
the capacity to offer coverage for catastrophic care. Medical bills are one of
the leading causes of bankruptcy in the US today, affecting around 2 million
people both with and without insurance annually. Therefore, we are asking
for your help to create a philanthropic fund that will cover the costs of
serious emergency care for our members.  Thank you for supporting the

efforts to integrate into American society. Health is a core contributor to
this integration process, driving economic productivity, wellbeing and family
development. Yet due to their documentation status, millions of women are
excluded from health insurance, severely limiting their access to health
resources. At Grameen PrimaCare we believe this is unacceptable and are
addressing this need through an alternative model.
Our mission is
to provide underserved women from low-income immigrant communities with a
high-quality, affordable primary care and health promotion program, empowering
them to lead healthier lives. 
Our pilot
program, Grameen VidaSana (GVS), was launched in Jackson Heights, Queens, in
September 2014. VidaSana, which means “healthy life” in Spanish, is our
ultimate goal for our members. Through this program, we provide access to a
bilingual, female primary care team, a wellness center, and a combination of
discounted health services, including specialty care and prescriptions. In
addition, GVS offers group based health promotion workshops that
cover such topics as women's health, nutrition, parenting, diabetes, weight
control, domestic violence and much more. Through providing a safe space for
group discussion and information exchange, we are creating a climate for
increased health agency and action. 


Our Impact
By offering access to high quality primary care, health education, and support,
we aim to build health literacy, self-efficacy and empower our members to improve
their health and wellbeing.We will also inform the
broader health and social innovation systems on what is needed to make our
health system truly inclusive.
Josefina's StoryOne of
GVS's first members, Josefina, suffered from an eye problem that left her
almost completely blind. Unable to get the treatment she desperately needed in
her home country of Mexico, she traveled to the United States and found the
surgery she required. Unfortunately her eye problems did not end there, and she
soon found her vision in trouble once again. When
she walked into Grameen VidaSana for the first time, she was looking for
a mammogram. What she found instead was a complete and comprehensive
primary care program that would ultimately provide her with free eyeglasses,
help with managing her diabetes, and a mammogram referral at no additional cost. Today,
after only two months, Josefina has changed her life drastically for the
better. She now takes the stairs at every chance, eats much healthier, visits
the program regularly for both doctor visits and to utilize the community space
(making her lunch in the practice's kitchen since her current job has no
facilities), and is even inspiring her health coaches to make changes in their
own habits. Although she was originally reluctant to join the program, as she
did not understand the need for regular check-ins since she wasn't sick every
day, she is now one of GVS's biggest advocates.Amazingly,
Grameen VidaSana has changed her life in another way as well: on one of her
regular visits to the practice, she ran into the brother she had not seen in
almost 15 years, since they were separated during their migration process to
the United States - his wife was visiting GVS for her own appointment!Josefina
is so grateful to all of the GVS staff and supporters, calling them
""angels."" By providing this type of care to women who do not have
access to it, we are improving the lives of so many.What We NeedWhile
GVS is able to offer our members a comprehensive enhanced primary care program,
as well as referrals to numerous specialty care providers, we do not yet have
the capacity to offer coverage for catastrophic care. Medical bills are one of
the leading causes of bankruptcy in the US today, affecting around 2 million
people both with and without insurance annually. Therefore, we are asking
for your help to create a philanthropic fund that will cover the costs of
serious emergency care for our members.  Thank you for supporting the
women of Grameen VidaSana!Other Ways You Can Help

 Frankly, it works like a blood pressure machine. However, in contrast, it measures your brain waves’ power, not your blood pressure level.You can use our application to train your brain, play a game and many other provided tasks, only using your thoughts. For example, you can focus a candle on a screen to improve the visibility; the more you focus it, the more it lights up.   Our application guides you to improve your brain waves’ power in concentration, relaxation and memory. We interpret it into easy readable figures and various types of graphs. The application will record your result. The next day or the next time you return to training, you can force your brain to get a higher score.Continuous training as such will make your brain function better and improve its concentration, relaxation and memory. 
Concentration:
Guide your focus several tasks on the screen to increase your concentration power, which will improve your brain functions over time. The research claims that the benefits are: Ability to think quickly, Feeling excited, Goal-oriented, Peak-performance, Highest levels of focus, Positive thoughts, Increased IQ and writing speed.​ 
Relaxation:
This eases your mind using several methods and will reflect your relaxation score. Training like this from time to time will improve your peace of  mind. The research claims that the benefits are: Deep Relaxation of the Body and Mind, Higher Levels of Creativity, Improved Problem-Solving Abilities, Improved Mood and Stability of Emotions.​ 
Memory:
Your memory will be trained using several methods such as the picture matching game, whereas we will show your memory score concurrently. Training like this from time to time will make your brain function better and enhance your memory. The research claims that the benefits are: New found binding mechanism among all parts of the brain and improving perception and memory. This training in brain waves’ power will propel your brain to be in a more healthy state. Reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s and any other brain disease.Old fashion methods used in hospitals to improve brain function like playing a card game or reading the 3D image, will be done on the paper and measure your result with big and messy EEG machine later. With BRAIN+, you will know the result of your brain improvement immediately by the BRAIN+ tablet screen. Thanks to this neurofeedback technology, you can force your brain to improve in real-time using BRAIN+.Also, you can train your brain with any other normal life method like meditation and so on. However, by the end of the day, you will be able to measure your brain’s power improvement with BRAIN+. Make your brain training more fun and meaningful by tracking it.Last but not least, you will get Windows10 tablet for work, leisure or for use when away from the training session! Our goal is to guide you to have a better brain and a better life.BRAIN+ does not need 3rd party devices like a mobile phone or PC.

Our state of the art technology will guide you to achieving a better brain and a better life.
And Yes! You get the Windows10 tablet for work, leisure or for use when away from the training session!
We are experts in what we do. We know how sensitive the EEG signal is. Sensors have to stick firmly on the scalp to read brain waves. We noticed some other products elsewhere, strangely placing sensors on thick  hair or on the back of the ears. Hair interrupts the EEG signal so instead, we place sensors in the best position as in our research paper. We even know how the body movement interferes with the EEG signal so our application will guide you for the best outcome.As the brain signal researchers, we proudly make real EEG device, the perfect BRAIN+ for you. BRAIN+ is more than just the EEG headband to read your brain waves. Our state-of-the-art EEG headband and smart algorithm system can improve your concentration, relaxation and memory.After much research, we found the correlation between several states of mind (Concentration, Relaxation, Memory, etc.) and brain waves. We also conducted a research on how to improve those states of mind.From this knowhow, we can extract your brain waves, monitor their power and guide you to have improved brain power with our special algorithm. For the best calibration, we took a trip to little Tibet - Leh Ladahk, the land of lama, iconic of the meditation master.We collect the data and do the comprehensive research to ensure that our device works just great for you. There are many main points out there regarding brain problems in this World. Let BRAIN+ be one factor that helps reduce these problems. Continuously using our application will bring you the better brain. Also, we could raise awareness for people to be more caring about their brain.  Build from the scratch.Put our heart in every detail.Authentically designed for your best experience 
Our state-of-the-art patent pending system extracts brain waves into a readable format.
Our smart algorithm makes a perfect correlation between brain waves and state of mind.

Our cutting edge circuit is carefully built to deliver the best signal with low noises.

Our EEG sensor from the US sensor maker company funded by NASA and US Navy, make our product even better. We have a special dry electrode -> Say goodbye to the wet gel on your scalp.

<p>My
name is John Guchua I am 28 years old, I was born and brought up in one of the
informal settlement (slums) of Nairobi Mukuru Viwandani or ‘Lunga Lunga’. I went
to school at Saint Elizabeth primary school. Due to my parents financial constraints
they were not able to take me to high school. This made me stay at home and
help them in their daily chores. Luckily, after 3 months, I was introduced by a
friend to a free Art School (Mukuru Arts and Craft). Here I was empowered
through learning art skills, both practical and theoretical. Luckily I was able
to make sales from the arts I produced. Through this journey of art I was able
to pay and join high school. It was both successful and a challenge too, as being
an artist it needs a lot of patience, commitment and love of art, when coming
to art sales you might stay for months without making any sale. Due to these
challenges I lost a lot of friends in judicial and mob killings as some of them
had become involved in crime and wanted to make ends meet for their family, some
were impatient and dropped out from the artistic world, while others involved themselves
in drug abuse. Only a few made it to be artists and to use it as a career. 

</p>
<p><span>I
started volunteering while I was in high school giving back to my community by
teaching and sharing art not only practically but also as a tool for expression
and therapy. I was signed into a dance school (Sarakasi and Safari park troupe
dance) where I learned the mediums of all genres of Dance and Theatre, implementing
them to my community.

</span></p>
<p><span> I was invited to join a yoga session at
one of yoga centers in Nairobi, Africa yoga project   where they offer free community
yoga class. I was inspired by its flow, the therapeutic healing and
transformation it had in mind body and soul, towards me, as I thought yoga
was only physical. I promised myself to learn it and share its vibes to my
community and to the people who are not able to pay yoga classes. I did my yoga
teacher training, and got certified as a Baptiste and Kundalini Yoga teacher, and
also as an art therapist and choreographer. I have been teaching community
outreaches, private and group classes, corporate and NGOs, spreading the love
of yoga and art therapy awareness. I am the founder of YOGARTEC company (yoga
and art technology) and co-founder of creative yoga millennium.i also work with africa yoga project and yoga teachers for africa(kundalini yoga under Yogi Bhajan teachings).</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>The aim and goals for this project is
to use yoga and art as a tool for transformation empowerment, healing and awakening,
reaching to all aspects <b>society,</b> people from different backgrounds e.g. children,
youths, adults and marginalized, people living with HIV/AIDs, physically and
mentally challenged, and for those living in trauma and stigma.</b></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>All
these classes to be done in a creative and fun way, I have had a lot of success
and challenges at the same time in yoga and art classes. The purpose of this fundraising
is to raise 1200 Dollars to purchase a 3-D video mapping projector and 3d
software. The project will overcome challenges and bring impact in yoga and art
classes, below are some of the challenges that will be covered show how the
projector and the software will be used.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">WORKSHOPS AND TRAINING (YOGA AND ART)</span></p>
<p>-Students will
learn and get empowered in anatomical structure, to understand how muscles,
bones and body function before joining yoga practice on the mat through
projection.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
My
name is John Guchua I am 28 years old, I was born and brought up in one of the
informal settlement (slums) of Nairobi Mukuru Viwandani or ‘Lunga Lunga’. I went
to school at Saint Elizabeth primary school. Due to my parents financial constraints
they were not able to take me to high school. This made me stay at home and
help them in their daily chores. Luckily, after 3 months, I was introduced by a
friend to a free Art School (Mukuru Arts and Craft). Here I was empowered
through learning art skills, both practical and theoretical. Luckily I was able
to make sales from the arts I produced. Through this journey of art I was able
to pay and join high school. It was both successful and a challenge too, as being
an artist it needs a lot of patience, commitment and love of art, when coming
to art sales you might stay for months without making any sale. Due to these
challenges I lost a lot of friends in judicial and mob killings as some of them
had become involved in crime and wanted to make ends meet for their family, some
were impatient and dropped out from the artistic world, while others involved themselves
in drug abuse. Only a few made it to be artists and to use it as a career. 


I
started volunteering while I was in high school giving back to my community by
teaching and sharing art not only practically but also as a tool for expression
and therapy. I was signed into a dance school (Sarakasi and Safari park troupe
dance) where I learned the mediums of all genres of Dance and Theatre, implementing
them to my community.


 I was invited to join a yoga session at
one of yoga centers in Nairobi, Africa yoga project   where they offer free community
yoga class. I was inspired by its flow, the therapeutic healing and
transformation it had in mind body and soul, towards me, as I thought yoga
was only physical. I promised myself to learn it and share its vibes to my
community and to the people who are not able to pay yoga classes. I did my yoga
teacher training, and got certified as a Baptiste and Kundalini Yoga teacher, and
also as an art therapist and choreographer. I have been teaching community
outreaches, private and group classes, corporate and NGOs, spreading the love
of yoga and art therapy awareness. I am the founder of YOGARTEC company (yoga
and art technology) and co-founder of creative yoga millennium.i also work with africa yoga project and yoga teachers for africa(kundalini yoga under Yogi Bhajan teachings).

The Impact

The aim and goals for this project is
to use yoga and art as a tool for transformation empowerment, healing and awakening,
reaching to all aspects society, people from different backgrounds e.g. children,
youths, adults and marginalized, people living with HIV/AIDs, physically and
mentally challenged, and for those living in trauma and stigma.
   What We Need & What You Get 

All
these classes to be done in a creative and fun way, I have had a lot of success

SCUBAJET accepts the challenge and brings <strong>some of the most popular aquatic activities to the next level. </strong>The water sports gear allows to make decisions based on individual needs or habits by combining motor power and paddling.  <strong>Comparable to an e-bike, it turns your aquatic equipment into fast, comfortable and reliable devices.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480673336/nufc4g5evkiqkblblmuw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Stand up paddling (SUP)</strong> is one of the fastest-growing water sports nowadays. Within a few seconds and requiring no tools SCUBAJET turns every stock board into a powerful e-SUP-board. On top of that, SCUBAJET can be used for other water sports, like <strong>canoeing, dinghies and even for snorkeling and diving.</strong></p><p>While conventional <strong>diving scooters</strong> are often big and bulky and weight between 10 and 25 kg (22 to 55 lbs.), the SCUBAJET has a streamlined appearance with only 3 kg (6.6 lbs.) including the Dive Adapter. Additionally underwater scooters are most often unwieldy, whereas the SCUBAJET allows to <strong>decide even during the dive whether to be used or not</strong>. If the SCUBAJET is not needed at the moment, it can simply be fixed to the buoyancy compensator – without any compromises. <strong>This simple solution is unique, there's nothing like it on the market. </strong></p><p>The SCUBAJET is constructed for max. pressure of 6 bar/87psi. We use a special shaft seal that can handle this amount of pressure. The theoretical depth limit based on the pressure is max. 50m/196ft. We give a warranty up to 45m/147ft.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480673435/rxulle5ah1ga2ewu9oaz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480673545/gihnnka29swoyb5bimjb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480673580/z2pmmugsqvmaa1zgqiut.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480673597/oi5uom5qyqlmzqrrqt24.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480673627/re4sh2tlgzchtfvqkawp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>One of the big advantages is the innovative adapter system that provides various possibilities to use SCUBAJET on any imaginable water sports equipment. <strong>No technical skills are needed at any point.</strong> The plug&amp;play system and the water resistant remote control make it easy to start, stop and select different speeds while using it on the water.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480673686/shpswrtexj1objna5uye.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>adapter systems and SCUBAJET</p><p> </p><p>Take your existing board or equipment and extend it with SCUBAJET easily.

She grew up in Italy near Lake Constance and pursued her water hobbies ever since. Three years ago, her daughter was born and she was confronted with reconciling family life and her beloved hobby. She didn't want to give up water sports but she felt insecure about taking her daughter on the SUP board. ""What if there is a thunderstorm coming up?"", was one of the thoughts fostering her tentativeness. In addition, she wanted to take the whole family to the water without buying a motorboat to enjoy the beautiful summer in Carinthia.</p><p>Out of these thoughts the idea of creating a flexible motor for water sports emerged.

SCUBAJET accepts the challenge and brings some of the most popular aquatic activities to the next level. The water sports gear allows to make decisions based on individual needs or habits by combining motor power and paddling.  Comparable to an e-bike, it turns your aquatic equipment into fast, comfortable and reliable devices.Stand up paddling (SUP) is one of the fastest-growing water sports nowadays. Within a few seconds and requiring no tools SCUBAJET turns every stock board into a powerful e-SUP-board. On top of that, SCUBAJET can be used for other water sports, like canoeing, dinghies and even for snorkeling and diving.While conventional diving scooters are often big and bulky and weight between 10 and 25 kg (22 to 55 lbs.), the SCUBAJET has a streamlined appearance with only 3 kg (6.6 lbs.) including the Dive Adapter. Additionally underwater scooters are most often unwieldy, whereas the SCUBAJET allows to decide even during the dive whether to be used or not. If the SCUBAJET is not needed at the moment, it can simply be fixed to the buoyancy compensator – without any compromises. This simple solution is unique, there's nothing like it on the market. The SCUBAJET is constructed for max. pressure of 6 bar/87psi. We use a special shaft seal that can handle this amount of pressure. The theoretical depth limit based on the pressure is max. 50m/196ft. We give a warranty up to 45m/147ft.One of the big advantages is the innovative adapter system that provides various possibilities to use SCUBAJET on any imaginable water sports equipment. No technical skills are needed at any point. The plug&play system and the water resistant remote control make it easy to start, stop and select different speeds while using it on the water.adapter systems and SCUBAJET Take your existing board or equipment and extend it with SCUBAJET easily. Select the appropiate adpater and you are ready to go in a few seconds. We provide adapters for SUP, kanu, dinghi boats and dive. Many of the adapters use standardized finplugs for maximum convenience. By now we support and provide adapters for more than 20 different manufactures and many of them use standardized finplugs. So it's easy for us to provide compatible adapters. 

 
  


 




 



 

 
 One of these Finbox Adapter is included with every SCUBAJET: - Future Fin System- O'Fish'l Fin System- LokBox Fin System- ProBox Fin System- US Finbox System- Sevylor Fin System- FCS II Fin System Special Adapter (available as pledges) - Dive Adapter (speed and motor activation can be controlled directly on the adapter)- Dinghi Adapter (will be delivered with a trim function and pivot up/down)- Kayacat Adapter (can be pivot up/down – for sailing for example)- Universal Adapter Boats/Kayak/Kanu (Tilt/Trim, steering with original rudder or with the Scubajet Adapter, self-supporting swivel arm, adapater will be fixed with 4 screws)Until now we support the following manufactures. We continuously extend the list. If you can't find the right adapter, please inform us about the desired manufacturer and we'll get in touch to put it on our adapter request list.manufacturers Upcoming Adapter in the next months:- Hobie Adapter that fits into the MirageDrive box- ONAK Adapter- Universal Adapter for SUP- Universal Adapter for KANU/KAYAKS- DIY Adapter Templates Our electric motor allows you to go further to find your perfect spot to enjoy. You are able to stay on the water longer and tackle bigger trips with your water buddies. SCUBAJET brings you back to the shore safely and is made for active people and sports enthusiasts as well as families. the handy dive adapterSCUBAJET on SUP-board with kids in a dinghi on the waterperfect for snorkelingSCUBAJET offers various engine mappings for scuba diving (slow speed and long battery lifetime), power mode (short high speed sprints), SUP (paddling support or surfing without paddle) or freehand. Measuring only 58 cm (~22 inch) length and a diameter of 7,2cm (~2,8 inch) and weighing just 3kg (~6,6 lbs), SCUBAJET is easy to transport and fits in every backpack.You can control the SCUBAJET easily with the included remote control. Three buttons control all the functions, for increasing/decreasing speed, as well as to spot the engine. The auto-shut off system stops the engine immediately if you fall into the water and it will also be used for initial power on SCUBAJET over magnetic switch. SCUBAJET is also safe for kids as well since we use jet-power instead of regular propeller motors.  Due to the latest safety and security regulations for batteries, there is a limit of two spare batteries per person for the larger lithium ion batteries (up to 160 wh per battery). But as we know traveling is particulary important of many water sports fans, it was very important to us to meet your expectations and so we now provide a travel battery pack that consists of 2x160 wh batteries, that is allowed on airplanes! We have tested and implemented a bunch of great features like the SmartPower Technology. It offers long battery time up to 240 minutes with the internal battery and up to 720 minutes with the external battery pack. The external battery pack will be available with beginning of 2017.   Every SCUBAJET has a high tech LED light in the front with 500 Lumen.It's not only super practical while staying on the water during your canoe-, dinghi- or SUP trip for underwater lighting, its also possible to use the lamp without the engine unit. The lamp alone is also proofed for a depth of 45m.And that's not all! If you need more Lumen for diving as example you will be able to upgrade the lamp to 1.500 Lumen or add it as accessory. 
 
 

 





 

During the entire development process, SCUBAJET was used by a lot of different people to get their opinion and as much feedback as possible. We've started to create a jet-engine for different applications two years ago and we already started the serial production, so it's a great opportunity for you to get the best price ever for the SCUBAJET.  Scope of delivery: SCUBAJET, charger, remote control, finbox adapterAfter we receive your order you can choose between different adapters for SUP (FCS II Fin System, Future Fin System, O'Fish'l Fin System, LokBox Fin System, ProBox Fin Systems, US Finbox System) or kanu (Sevylor, universal adapter). Patrizia has always been a sporting ace and a real water lover. She grew up in Italy near Lake Constance and pursued her water hobbies ever since. Three years ago, her daughter was born and she was confronted with reconciling family life and her beloved hobby. She didn't want to give up water sports but she felt insecure about taking her daughter on the SUP board. ""What if there is a thunderstorm coming up?"", was one of the thoughts fostering her tentativeness. In addition, she wanted to take the whole family to the water without buying a motorboat to enjoy the beautiful summer in Carinthia.Out of these thoughts the idea of creating a flexible motor for water sports emerged. Consequently, her boyfriend Armin and his father Gert developed the SCUBAJET. Nowadays, Patrizia enjoys standing on her SUP board together with her daughter to escape the crowds at Lake Wörth's beaches.Patrizia has a strong background in marketing in the sea freight industry.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi my name is Marvin Columbus and I am the creator of <i><strong>""Box Runners""</strong></i>! My passions are boxing, community, and kids! In 2006 I created an amateur boxing program for high school aged kids called,  ""K.O. High Boxing"" where local and regional high schools could compete against each other. The program was an absolute success which lasted 10  years and was an absolute hit within the schools, community and boxing world.  More than 1,000 kids were able to successfully raise their GPA's and graduate high school through my mentoring and athletic boxing program. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>K.O. High Boxing events grew to become the most successful amateur boxing show in California every year! K.O. High Boxing would draw in some of the the largest audiences, as well as many of the top celebrities in the world, such as Justin Bieber, Samuel L. Jackson, and the entire Muhammad Ali family and many more who were also huge fans of these unbelievably gifted kids!  </p>
<p>Within this past year, I just petitioned and received my professional promoters license in order to promote our first professional boxing show on October 15th, 2017.  Where we will announce and debut our Box Runners shoe.</p>
<p>The success of this crowdfunding campaign is extremely important to me as it will initiate the MASS PRODUCTION of Box Runners!  I have been working on this shoe for 4 years now.  I have done all of the ""foot work"" myself, from investing all of my money into the design, patent pending, and travel  across the world to find just the right manufacturer. This is the only cross-training shoe of its kind! Never before has a shoe like this existed! A boxing shoe where you can both train in the ring and run the street, track or treadmill, while still having full support along with superior design qualities. This shoe alone will change the game of boxing, combat sports, and running.</p>
<p> I am extremely passionate about helping and mentoring our youth, particularly our Inner-City kids. Time and time again, I noticed that many kids could not afford to pay upwards of $100 - $150 for a good pair of boxing shoes and another $100 or so, for a good pair of running shoes. They would just have to pick one pair and make them work for both sports. There would be many times where the kids would have to spar, in running shoes; shoes that were too heavy for their feet and/or run in boxing shoes; shoes that didn't have support for feet or ankles for that part of the training. Often times these young athletes would roll their ankles as a result of not having proper footwear and ankle support. </p>
<p> I started wondering why there wasn't a boxing shoe that allowed you to cross-train?  I mean think about it, how many boxers do you know that also run?! It's practically the mainstay of a boxers training! So I did my research.  As it turns out, the reason there hadn't been a cross-training boxing shoe was simply due to fear of design flaws. Many manufacturers said,  ""the shoes would be to heavy, they wouldn't last, and would simply fall apart due to the strenuous training, wear and tear that a boxer imparts on shoes in the ring alone not to mention the added stress, wear and tear of running on the street or track.""  In 2013 , I decided to I pull my own design team together to find an affordable solution! Together, we  reverse engineered many different types of both running and boxing shoes. We were able to find and fix the flaws with a one of a kind design that had never been conceived of or done before. I then applied for and received the patent and invested all of my money into creating the prototypes hence BOX RUNNERS!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What can Box Runners prevent that a regular boxing shoe can't? </strong></p>
<p>For those who aren't familiar with boxing or combat sports training, the ankle is surrounded by soft tissue and many different ligaments and muscles which help give it not only it's range of motion but, also strength.  One minor mishap could ruin an athletes career as, these ligaments and muscles are very slow and tedious to heal.  A lot of fighters tend to typically have ankle and knee issues simply due to lack of support or from rolling their ankles numerous times during regular training seasons and athletic careers.  Although the standard  boxing shoe is light and flexible, it's usage is typically limited to the ring/gym. Box Runners allow fighters to ""sit on their punches"" - it gives them more balance, and is designed specifically to guard the ankle and shin allowing the foot a full range of motion yet fully stable and secure at the same time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Shall Receive:</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to raise $50,000 and all funds will go STRICTLY towards MASS PRODUCTION. I've done all of the ""foot work"" myself! I have completed all of the design and legal work up to this point, now the last step is simply manufacturing in MASS PRODUCTION.</p>
<p>Even if the full $50,000 goal isn't reached, what ever money is donated will still go strictly towards mass production. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution towards this campaign  would would significantly help in playing a HUGE roll into helping manifest my dream for OUR kids and future athletes!  I've done all that I can to get these shoes up and ""running""! I've trekked across the world from Canada to Pakistan, to finally finding the right manufacturing company for Box Runners in China. The company I have found is absolutely amazing, they were not only able to bring my vision to reality, but also implemented high quality material for these shoes to have greater durability and longevity.</p>
<p>I know that Box Runners will play a huge part in changing the standard of training safely and adding so much value to boxing and combat sports in general.  Box Runners represent FREEDOM to the cross-training athlete.  Each and every athlete that has trained in a pair of Box Runners, has told me that they feel ""Free"", they don't feel like there are any limitations to what they can do. Most importantly, no longer do they worry about the cost or space of juggling so many pair of shoes in one bag! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p> For those who can't donate financially however love our shoe, it's ok!! Spreading the word is just as effective and is still greatly appreciated!! Simply sharing on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook can make just as much of an impact. Thank you very much for even taking the time to share my vision, I hope the body of work I've presented to you proves how serious I am about this incredible shoe  and how passionate I am about completing this mission. The athletic arena needs Box Runners! </p>

campaign. Through the generosity of so many good people I raised more than half
of what I need. But there is still the remaining amount so I can complete the
treatments. Hopefully this will be the last time-frame that I will be asking
for help. For those of you that already gave God bless you and I’m not asking for
more from you, but if you know anyone that hasn’t given and might want to
please pass this on to them. Once again thanks. Things are going great.
Treatments are going great. I’m walking more and more and soon I will be back
on my feet again and a whole lot of prayers will have been answered.  </p><p>My Story:</p>My name is Walter Olkewicz and I've had the good fortune to be an actor for the past 40 years. I've done some 50 movies and over a 100 TV shows. That ended about 15 years ago with my first knee surgery. Infections cropped up over and over again to the tune of, to date, 19 surgeries and my living in a wheel chair the past ten years. Recently I was introduced to a doctor from Mexico who'd had great results with the treatment of infections. The shots I was given have been working and according to my surgeon the infections have been subsiding. The prayers of friends and family were finally answered. <p></p><p>The only problem is the injections and the care I've needed to continue- none of this is covered by insurance. I've depleted all of my savings and I simply can not afford to continue without help. Before this treatment started my doctor spoke of the very real possibility of having my leg amputated. Needless to say, this scared the bejesus out of me. After so many surgeries and this most welcome recent success, I simply can not even imagine not continuing. </p><p></p><p>Please Help!</p><p></p><p>  **** I'd like at this point to thank all who have helped. As most of you know this is the 2nd half of a campaign that started a couple of months ago. Although I only reached a bit less than 40% of my goal (explaining the need for this campaign), I have begun the treatments and have increased their frequency 200%!! The results are miraculous! Talk of amputation is at this point off the table. Though still a possibility it has gone from a 50/50 chance to less than a 5% chance. I can breathe easier. But now I need to complete the program which will reach into about a 6 month total. The shots both eradicate the infection AND (the more important part right now) build the cells and revive a leg that hasn't been used much in the past 12-15 years. Two months ago it was like trying to walk on a wet noodle. As my leg builds strength (currently at bread stick status), it will eventually- with a shipload of hard work- return to most of the strength I had in the leg 20 years ago.  Part of my ""Goal"" calculations include work with a physical trainer. Luckily some of that IS covered by insurance. Insurance covers 8 times per 3-month period, I need work with a trainer 5+ times a week.Not an easy path, but one I can dedicate myself to. Thanks to all of you.</p><p></p><p>Over the first 30 years of my blessed career I was known for helping people (In the ten years that I ran my theater- The Jewel Box- over half of my students were there on ""Scholarships"" because they simply could not afford to come to class otherwise). I have coached fellow actors, people on the set, pretty much anybody I was lucky enough to work with for free, just trying to give back some of the good fortune I'd been lucky enough to receive. </p><p></p><p>Now I find it time to ask for help. </p><p></p><p>The estimated cost of these injections, the travel involved with obtaining them, and the personal care I need in the time until I am walking and ""on my feet"" again is about fifty thousand dollars (that figure might seem high until you consider that the hospital and doctor bills that were covered by insurance is nearly half a million)</p><p></p><p>True ""Hope"" is finally in my heart again. And being the creative animal that I am thoughts for a new theater keep me awake at night. I will make it happen!

If not my prayers are with you for wherever your generosity might flow.</p></div>","Note to my 3rd campaign:Well I hope you are not getting tired of me and this
campaign. Through the generosity of so many good people I raised more than half
of what I need. But there is still the remaining amount so I can complete the
treatments. Hopefully this will be the last time-frame that I will be asking
for help. For those of you that already gave God bless you and I’m not asking for
more from you, but if you know anyone that hasn’t given and might want to
please pass this on to them. Once again thanks. Things are going great.
Treatments are going great. I’m walking more and more and soon I will be back
on my feet again and a whole lot of prayers will have been answered.  My Story:My name is Walter Olkewicz and I've had the good fortune to be an actor for the past 40 years. I've done some 50 movies and over a 100 TV shows. That ended about 15 years ago with my first knee surgery. Infections cropped up over and over again to the tune of, to date, 19 surgeries and my living in a wheel chair the past ten years. Recently I was introduced to a doctor from Mexico who'd had great results with the treatment of infections. The shots I was given have been working and according to my surgeon the infections have been subsiding. The prayers of friends and family were finally answered. The only problem is the injections and the care I've needed to continue- none of this is covered by insurance. I've depleted all of my savings and I simply can not afford to continue without help. Before this treatment started my doctor spoke of the very real possibility of having my leg amputated. Needless to say, this scared the bejesus out of me. After so many surgeries and this most welcome recent success, I simply can not even imagine not continuing. Please Help!  **** I'd like at this point to thank all who have helped. As most of you know this is the 2nd half of a campaign that started a couple of months ago. Although I only reached a bit less than 40% of my goal (explaining the need for this campaign), I have begun the treatments and have increased their frequency 200%!! The results are miraculous! Talk of amputation is at this point off the table. Though still a possibility it has gone from a 50/50 chance to less than a 5% chance. I can breathe easier. But now I need to complete the program which will reach into about a 6 month total. The shots both eradicate the infection AND (the more important part right now) build the cells and revive a leg that hasn't been used much in the past 12-15 years. Two months ago it was like trying to walk on a wet noodle. As my leg builds strength (currently at bread stick status), it will eventually- with a shipload of hard work- return to most of the strength I had in the leg 20 years ago.  Part of my ""Goal"" calculations include work with a physical trainer. Luckily some of that IS covered by insurance. Insurance covers 8 times per 3-month period, I need work with a trainer 5+ times a week.Not an easy path, but one I can dedicate myself to. Thanks to all of you.Over the first 30 years of my blessed career I was known for helping people (In the ten years that I ran my theater- The Jewel Box- over half of my students were there on ""Scholarships"" because they simply could not afford to come to class otherwise). I have coached fellow actors, people on the set, pretty much anybody I was lucky enough to work with for free, just trying to give back some of the good fortune I'd been lucky enough to receive. Now I find it time to ask for help. The estimated cost of these injections, the travel involved with obtaining them, and the personal care I need in the time until I am walking and ""on my feet"" again is about fifty thousand dollars (that figure might seem high until you consider that the hospital and doctor bills that were covered by insurance is nearly half a million)True ""Hope"" is finally in my heart again. And being the creative animal that I am thoughts for a new theater keep me awake at night. I will make it happen! You can't imagine how frustrating something like persistent knee infections can be in blocking this dream. It would be like Picasso not being able to paint because he is in court fighting overdue traffic tickets. Okay, it's not exactly the same but you get the idea. Over the past few years I have had lots of hospital time to read and study the great spiritual thinkers. I've come to understand that my ideas for an uplifting, inspiring theater are a direct result of me connecting with my Divine Purpose. I don't want that to sound egotistical or ""highfalutin"", you see each of us has a Divine Purpose. I've just been lucky enough to finally understand mine.  So anyone generous enough to contribute, I will gladly include you in our opening audience at ""Up On Stage"", my new theater. Sooo....Anybody who contributes $25  gets an autographed picture of me from whatever work of mine they most like (or a copy of my knee X-rays if you are goofy enough for that to be more appealing to you). I apologize for the levity, but I learned a while ago that if I can't laugh at all this I am in real trouble. For $50 dollars you will get four tickets to my first weeks opening - copies of my knee X-rays will be distributed at the door. And for a $100 dollars or more you will get an autograph picture, four tickets to opening week, and my son will come over and mow your lawn.  Okay he is probably too busy to do that. If you call me I'll give you my advice on how to make your lawn greener by using paper machete mulch. Thank you very much for even reading this request.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why a Milk Bank in Yorkton?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Many mothers in our region are eager and willing to donate breast milk, but as of right now, there is no local depot for collection. By establishing The Milk Drop right here in Yorkton, we can dramatically increase the amount of milk that mothers in our region can donate. </p>
<p>The Milk Drop will be located at Yorkton Regional Health Centre in the Sunrise Health Region and will collect donations of breast milk from Yorkton and area mothers. The donated milk will be sent to The Calgary Mothers’ Milk Bank for processing, testing, pasteurization and distribution by prescription. </p>
<h3>Who Benefits</h3>
<div>Babies of course! Particularly babies who are premature or who are at a high risk for gastrointestinal issues. Breastmilk is one of the most effective, and cost effective, ways of caring for these little ones in need. <p></p>
<p>Our donors are also not just women who have an excessive milk supply. Some women who donate have suffered the devastating loss their own child. When their bodies cruelly produce milk with no baby to feed, these women selflessly choose to pump and donate milk to help other parents' babies in need. </p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to raise at least $3,000 to bring a milk depot here to Yorkton. So far, thanks to the generosity of our community, we've raised just over $1,000. </p>
<p>We're setting our campaign goal here for $2,500 to raise enough money to purchase the freezer we need for the depot. We are aiming to raise some extra funds to purchase the processed milk back for babies in need in the Sunrise Health Region.</p>
<p><i>Funds raised will go through the The Health Foundation and will be eligible for a tax receipt.</i></p>

<p>Enlaps is designed to achieve infinite timelapse with long term time lapse setting. </p>
<p>Simply install it, adjust the solar panel to absord maximum sunlight, and Enlaps Tikee will take care of itself. By deploying a smart algorithm, Enlaps Tikee will decide what to do to keep shooting as long as possible. Basically it will prioritize shooting against wireless communication in case of critical battery level. </p>
<p> Without sun power, but with a full battery charge, the device can provide 10 min interval of continuous shooting during one full week. </p>

</div></div>","Have you ever seen great time lapse photography ? These videos where you can see a long event in a few seconds like a blooming flower, a stadium filled with people in a matter of seconds, a construction project built from the ground to the sky or the sun rising, the clouds passing overhead and the sun setting over a panoramic vista.  Enlaps is a unique, complete, plug-and-play time lapse solution, from initial photography to sharing over the web. Infinite battery energy, no memory card limit, for a professional quality result. For professionals photographers, photography lovers, or for fun.




Today, the three main concerns when shooting long periodic events are battery, storage and processing. Our product, Enlaps Tikee effectively  removes all three constraints.

Energy is provided by an integrated adjustable photovoltaïc solar cell, leading to long term timelapse capability. 
Once captured, photos are wirelessly transmitted to the cloud, so you never run out of storage space. 
Time lapses are automatically processed and can be directly edited or shared.
















Enlaps offers a user friendly web application, reachable with any browser, on your laptop, tablet or smartphone. Easy setup and automatic timelapse creation for anybody, as well as powerful features for advanced users. 























Field of view sample :

Tikee field of view







Your are already a timelapser, so you can also :
 - Download a set of pictures and edit it with your favorite software
- Download your timelapse video directly, to insert it in a movie project
- Upload your existing timelapses to the web app





Enlaps is designed to achieve infinite timelapse with long term time lapse setting. 
Simply install it, adjust the solar panel to absord maximum sunlight, and Enlaps Tikee will take care of itself. By deploying a smart algorithm, Enlaps Tikee will decide what to do to keep shooting as long as possible. Basically it will prioritize shooting against wireless communication in case of critical battery level. 
 Without sun power, but with a full battery charge, the device can provide 10 min interval of continuous shooting during one full week. 



After a real work of brainstorming, hundred of sketchs and a dozen of 3D prototypes, Tikee was born. We designed our smart timelapse camera with a sleek aesthetic to keep it simple and user friendly, as our complete solution. 



In November 2015 , Enlaps was awarded with it timelapse solution at the CES Innovation Awards.
In December 2015, Tikee was awarded at Spark Design Awards from San Francisco in the product category.",36.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Farah and I love kids. It took me 2 years to conceive my daughter Safiyyah. It was the greatest joy of my life and I had the most perfect pregnancy and delivery anyone can ask for. It were the incidents that followed that was devastating! Much to everyone's surprise, my daughter got menegitis after birth and due to A LOT of mistakes made by doctors as well, she consequently had severe brain damage after the bacteria ate her brain tissues. She just turned 3 on the 8th of April and she has global developmental delay, vision impairment (has vision to an extent) and cerebal palsy. She doesn't sit, or walk on her own, and doesn't talk. It's really difficult to carry her around as she is on the chubby end and weighs more than 40lbs. Looking at her you could never tell anything is wrong because she was a typical healthy child at birth without any abnormalities, but once you spend a little time with her you will start wondering why she's not doing A LOT or ANY of the things her age children would be doing :(. It kills me to not have to go through milestones with her and there is a constant thought of what if something I could have done differently or been more aware of what the doctors were doing. But now were keeping all that behind us and just focusing and putting all our energy on Safiyyah's well being...but we need help..<br/><br/>I want to raise a campaign for Safiyyah as we see so much potential in her. She was given just minutes to live and she has come so far with doctors in awe. She truly is a fighter! Her only medicine is intense therapy; vision therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and most important of them all-physiotherapy. Unfortunately, everything is so expensive. We as parents feel that with intense therapy sessions, she will soon enough be able to sit, stand, and walk on her own.</p>
<p>With contributors that may be able to fund money for her, it will substancially help us in giving Safiyyah the maximum support in achieving all the daily and basic functions of a normal human being, and I really hope that can happen sooner than later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We wanted enough money to give Safiyyah therapy sessions every single day because her brain needs constant repition for it to remember the function and start giving out signals on it's own. Each therapy costs a minimum of $125-150.00 for 45mins-1hour. We don't want to start the intense daily sessions until we get enough money raised, because we don't want to have to stop halfway because of insufficient money, as everything upto then would just go to waste.</p>
<p>We've also heard from fellow parents who are going through similar situations with their child, tell us about a therapy session in Chili where it is a 5-week course of intense physiotherapy directly with the person who invented CME therapy (Ramon Cuevas) and it costs around $15, 000.00. Therefore, this is the reason for our goal amount because we would really appreciate and love it if we could try this out for Safiyyah also, as we've heard very remarkable outcomes!!!</p>
<p>If not in Chili we are lucky enough to have the next best right here in Downtown, Toronto. So in order to have at least 6 months, twice daily, 5 times a week we need $300/day, $1,500/week and $6,000/month! All this is only possible with funds raised!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Each person who contributes anything will have a huge impact for my little girl Safiyyah. Hopefully with everyone's help and prayer, she will be able to become more independant and function like any other child her age. I feel she is ""on her mark, get set, ready...and the GO"" is just waiting to be given by her brain. Once she starts doing so, all of that reward goes back to every individual that helped her in any way in this process, and that's just priceless! How many people can tell others that they hepled a child to walk?! It never lets you take anything even as simple as being able to look at someone and smile for granted.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>If folks could get the word out and make some noise about this campaign that is still very rewarding!!!</p>
<p>(You can even use the Indiegogo share tools!)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>PLEASE HELP MY LITTLE ANGEL, SAFIYYAH!! May you all who consider this campaign have the best of everything in life...God Bless!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please visit our Facebook Group ""Prayers for Aaron"" at the following link:</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>First and foremost, we want to say thank you for taking the time to read about our very loving son. Our names are Linnea and Richard Harding. We are a GOD loving Christian family with four children. I am disabled with four bulging discs and compression on my sciatic nerve along with other medical issues. I've been trying to get on disability now for two years. My husband, Richard, works as much overtime as he can to support our family. We are always trying to make ends meet from week to week.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday evening, March 20, our 20 year old son, Aaron Hardy, was hit by a car as he was crossing the road here in Cocoa, FL. The vehicle hit him so hard that it threw him several feet in the air and knocked his shoes off. He was airlifted by medical chopper to <span class=""userContent""><span class=""text_exposed_show""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HealthFirstHolmesRegional?group_id=0"" id=""js_15"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Health First Holmes Regional Medical Center</a> in Melbourne, FL.</span></span> After CT scans, it was determined he had multiple skull fractures and a broken pelvis. He has Intra-Cranial Pressure on the brain, which they have finally been able to reduce to 14 from 38. They are keeping him heavily sedated. He will not be able to work for at least two years if he is ever able to work again. We are just waiting to see if there has been any brain damage and what kind of rehabilitation and exactly how long the process will be.</p>
<p>The doctors have said he will probably be in the hospital for a few months and then many months of rehabilitation. The medical bills will be astronomical and he has no medical insurance. The driver of the car also had no car insurance to cover an incident such as this.</p>
<p>Any and all contributions will be greatly appreciated. As I have said, this is going to be a long process with astronomical medical expenses.</p>
<p>And last night, his girlfriend tells me she may be pregnant. He has no idea that he may be a father.</p>
<p>We also have a Facebook page called Prayers For Aaron. Please join the group and keep him in your prayers. He will survive physically and financially with your prayers. <strong>Thank You!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>In all honesty, he will need more than $100,000 to cover all of his medical expenses and rehabilitation. But, we are setting our goal on here for just $25,000 to hopefully reach that goal and have a lower fee since we will need every dollar possible to go towards his expenses. Every contribution will be helpful no matter how small.</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach the $25,000 goal, every penny of it will be for his medical bills and rehab.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help my son get the best medical care and rehabilitation he can afford. It would show him that there are still very good and helpful people in this World. Even if they do not know you, they are willing to Pay It Forward to help out another human being.</p>
<p>I have never had to try and raise money like this. It breaks my heart that I must ask for this type of assistance, but I love my son very much and would do anything for him. He is my warrior. I will also try to raise money locally, but I thought this may be the best exposure to more loving individuals with an open heart. Thank you again for any contribution you are able and willing to give. <strong>GOD BLESS YOU!</strong></p>

<p>Dear Friends, Family &amp; Community,<br/><br/>This November, I have the high hopes of participating in a trip to Nicaragua with <a href=""http://www.ndimed.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Natural Doctors International"">Natural Doctors International</a>. The purpose of this trip for me personally is to gain clinical herbal medicine skills in a clinic where they use herbal and natural remedies as primary care. This is a very unique and special opportunity for me to deepen skills that are very hard to gain in the United States. In addition, I will have the opportunity to study medical Spanish at <a href=""http://www.escuelahorizonte.edu.ni/programa.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Escuela Horizonte"">Escuela Horizonte</a>, and be able to offer healing services to a wider community upon my return.<br/><br/>I will be able to spend time with leading U.S. herbalists and licensed naturopathic doctors and gain hands on experience using skills needed in a clinical setting including: interview, physical exam, differential diagnosis, and preparation and administration of integrative treatments, which may include herbal medicine, nutritional supplements, homeopathy, acupuncture, massage and bodywork, flower essence therapy, counseling, and pharmaceutical medicine. I will also have the opportunity to review patient cases in daily round table discussions, attend special classes on relevent topics, and learn more about global health.<br/><br/>The cost of the trip supports the continued work of Natural Doctors International in the clinic in Omtepe, which is an extremely medically under-served island. The remaining cost of the trip goes toward payment for medical Spanish classes as well as the families providing homestays and airfare. I will also be delivering donated medical supplies and herbal medicines that I have gathered upon my arrival.</p>
Please consider donating to make this dream a reality for me and to support the continued and much needed work of Natural Doctors International.<br/><p><br/>Many Thanks in Advance to All of You!<br/><br/>Love,<br/>Ricky</p>

washrooms and a spacious waiting area for patients. A staff nurse will be
available three days a week with a conservative estimate of 60 patients seen
each day.</p>
<p>Not only will the clinic provide a source of income for

treatment of patients. This is a

<p>While all major construction is complete and the building

would ensure adequate water for the clinic. A septic system would allow the
washrooms and sinks in the exam rooms to be used properly. And two exam rooms
still lack cabinets and beds.</p>
<p>The cost to complete these remaining projects is $5,000.

<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
<p>My project is designed to bring joy and laughter to cancer patients as well as to create awareness.</p>
<p>My name is Michelle, a wife and mother of two lovely children.  I have spent the last year fighting an aggressive life threatening cancer and thankfully I am now almost done my nightmare journey.  I have been so supported by my friends and my community that it has left me with an incredible desire to give back.  </p>
<p>My project is a three-part project.</p>
The First Part:</div>
<div>Is a book called ""The Cancer Warrior Handbook"".  This is a funny, real, down to earth handbook on how to live through chemo, radiation etc.   This is not another nutritional guide or health guide on how to live with cancer.  No WAY!  There is enough of that out there.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Second Part:</div>

<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Michelle and team.</p></div>","What is this all about?
My project is designed to bring joy and laughter to cancer patients as well as to create awareness.
My name is Michelle, a wife and mother of two lovely children.  I have spent the last year fighting an aggressive life threatening cancer and thankfully I am now almost done my nightmare journey.  I have been so supported by my friends and my community that it has left me with an incredible desire to give back.  
My project is a three-part project.
The First Part:
Is a book called ""The Cancer Warrior Handbook"".  This is a funny, real, down to earth handbook on how to live through chemo, radiation etc.   This is not another nutritional guide or health guide on how to live with cancer.  No WAY!  There is enough of that out there.  
 
The Second Part:
Currently being produced by Gadbois Photography, a documentary that will shine some light on the beauty that can lie within each one of us.
 
The Third Part:
Our ""Warrior Bags"", these are lovely gift baskets created to help newly diagnosed cancer patients pamper themselves and bring a little joy back into their lives.  Specially designed by Michelle, herself a Cancer Warrior, these goodie baskets contain facial lotions, lap blankets, hand crafted soap, washcloths, lip balm, a toothbrush, bracelet, a sugar free lollipop, a copy of ""The Cancer Warrior Handbook"", a delicious treat, etc.  These bags will be sent out to cancer patients free of charge.

<h3>Imagine How You Can Change the Future of Medicine! </h3>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if you could look up your medical records as easily and securely as you would look up your checking account balance online?  Wouldn't it be useful, for example, to be able to print your child's immunization records on demand, even if the information came from different providers or different facilities?  Wouldn't it be incredible to receive real-time notifications when new test or lab results are posted to your medical record? </p>
<p><strong><em>And wouldn't it be mind-blowing to be able to access every medical document, produced by every provider, at every medical facility you've ever visited and be able to retain control over that information forever?</em></strong></p>
<p>This project is the culmination of years of effort in bringing together the right people, developing the technological infrastructure and strategic partnerships, as well as defining the medical and legal framework to make this happen.</p>
<p>It is our hope that you will see the importance of this project and the significance of the role you can play in transforming the medical landscape of tomorrow.</p>
<p>As you read and learn about the ""My Medical Records"" Project, you will learn about the various elements necessary to bring together your records in one place. You will also learn how a Health Security Number is a prerequisite to bringing these records together. Your contributions will go directly to funding an open-sourced software portal which we will build using the proprietary technology we've already developed. By implementing this software solution, we will open the door to a whole new way of looking at medical records.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Reality of Patient-Centered Care</h3>
<p>The biggest obstacle with healthcare record integration is the absence of a ""Unique Patient Identifier"" (also known as a UPI). Without it, it is almost impossible to bring all of our records together from different providers and different facilities. A Unique Patient Identifier can be a medical record number, for example. It identifies you to your health care provider. Part of the problem, is that everybody uses a different Unique Patient Identifier to identify you.</p>
<p>Privacy advocates balk at the idea of having the government or any single group maintain a database of Unique Patient Identifiers. Our approach is uniquely different. We use a method of producing UPIs which does not involve databases. Only you and your providers know your UPI. Also, the data stored under the UPI is protected, so even if your UPI is lost or stolen, your health records are still protected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Introducing Your Health Security Number</h3>
<p>Our portal will provide you with your Health Security Number is without relying on on serialized numbers (i.e., numbers in a sequence), randomized numbers (which cannot be reproduced if lost or stolen) or numbers stored in a centralized database. When your Health Security Number is produced, it will only be known to you and your providers who know you.  Your Health Security Number will uniquely identify you to all of your providers including your doctors, dentists, pharmacists and other health care professionals.</p>

<h3>A True Grass-Roots Movement</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We have worked closely with regional, state and national leadership to develop a wide grass-roots effort to make patient-centered records a reality.  Over the past decade, we've listened to patients, doctors, and hospitals about their needs and their desire for improved access to records.  We've developed strategic partnerships with a number of companies and entrepreneurs.  We've received a number of accolades and endorsements from politicians and decision-makers.</p>

<h3>But aren't all doctors going electronic anyway?</h3>
<p>The short answer is ""some are, and some are not."" Despite attempts by lawmakers to promote wide adoption of electronic records, only some doctors and hospitals have already transitioned to electronic health records system, while others are in the process of transitioning, and some have vowed to fight such a transition.And just because a facility is electronic, it does not mean that you will have personal access to your records or access to records maintained at other sites.In a survey of 2,758 physicians published in the New England Journal of Medicine, only four percent of respondents had a robust, fully integrated electronic records system (NEJM: 359:50-60, July 2008). Today’s health care is being delivered by some providers who embrace branded electronic records that are poorly integrated as well as those who continue to resist the electronification of records altogether. It is the lack of coordination between these groups that remains one of the biggest barriers to unification of records. </p>

<h3>Don't I have access to my records anyway?</h3>
<p>Absolutely, yes.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guarantees patients access to their records.  A number of obstacles remain, however.  For example, providers often will charge ""administrative fees"" each and every time records are produced.  The records are usually limited to one facility or provider, and not truly integrated.  Furthermore, the data is seldom presented electronically, in a manner accessible by today's smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>Our proposal goes well beyond simple access to records. It provides you with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure access to our open-sourced software portal (developed with your generous contribution) to generate your own unique personal Health Security Number;</li>
<li>A physical card imprinted with your unique Health Security Number;</li>
<li>Your secure cloud-space, reserved for your personal health records;</li>
<li>Migration of all legacy records (paper &amp; electronic) from any number of sources to your cloud-space;</li>
<li>Access to our ""fax-to-cloud"" functionality and other bridging solutions to keep your records perpetually up-to-date;</li>
<li>Access to software enabling private, secure access to your records using your Mac, PC, smartphone, or tablet, and;</li>
<li>Electronic notification to you when someone views or changes anything in your cloud-space.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why is this a ""good"" thing?</h3>
<p>Our Health Security Number and approach to medical records is beneficial in so many ways. Let's discuss just few of them.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction of Medical Errors</strong></p>
<p>Having easier access to you own records gives you a better chance of catching medical errors in your chart. Although existing laws insure that patients have the right to ask for their records, very few patients actually exercise the right because of the paperwork and fees associated with a records release. Our vision, is that eventually you'll be able to see your provider, receive a text notification that your records have been updated, and be able to review the note for that encounter as soon as its generated. This unprecedented level of transparency will reduce errors associated with erroneous charting, by empowering patients through easier and seamless access to their own records.</p>
<p><strong>Elimination of Redundant Testing</strong></p>
<p>Patients are often time seen by providers at different sites for the same problem. Consider, for example, a patient who is seen in the ER for abdominal pain, and a day later, follows-up with her primary care provider. Coordination of care is made more difficult by the fact that the second provider doesn't have access to the lab information from the earlier visit. In order to minimize delays, providers will often repeat the testing. This is done because it is often a faster way of getting the information as compared to signing the release, faxing it over, and waiting for the reply. Duplicate testing is an incredible waste on health care resources. Our vision is for a future where an empowered patient can use their Health Security Number to access labs and tests from any site of service and share it with anybody they wish.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Current laws require providers to safeguard your health records, but how would you know if an unauthorized person was looking into your chart? With paper charts, you would never know. Patients must take it on faith that the many people with access to their record, often times including ancillary personnel such as janitors, cleaning staff, etc., will not abuse those rights. And if someone breaches that confidence, no one will know. The situation with electronic records is not much better. Although an audit trail is often created, patients are rarely notified of access to their records. We believe that we can build an infrastructure where patients using a Health Security Number can get notified when their cloud-based record is accessed and they can decide whether that access is appropriate or not.</p>
<p>In regards to data security, if a provider takes your office chart to the hospital, and it unknowingly falls out of his briefcase and onto the ground, your records become immediately accessible to the first person who picks it up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your Health Security Number falls out of your pocket and is picked up by the same stranger, he would find that your encrypted health records are protected by your login and password.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging the Divide</strong></p>
<p>The Health Security Number serves as a bridge to unify records between paper-based providers and providers using branded electronic records. One of the biggest barriers to adoption of more robust systems, is the cost incurred by the provider or facility. We are committed to showing providers how they can use our innovative platform to transition to a paper-free office at no cost to them. We need your voice and support to help get this word out.</p>
<p>What is the Purpose of Crowd-Funding?</p>
<p>The purpose of this crowd funding initiative is to raise sufficient funds to build an open-source software solution to operate a web portal for patient access.</p>
<p>Clients will ultimately be able to obtain their Health Security Number on demand using our proprietary technology, use the portal as a pathway to accessing records, and use our ""fax-to-cloud"" functionality to keep the information perpetually up-to-date.</p>
<p>We will create all of the software and bridging solutions necessary to accomplish these tasks.</p>
<p>This software authoring effort will require additional funding in excess of what is customary for normal software development and deployment. This is partly because of the safeguards and regulatory constraints governing the privacy of medical records. A significant amount of IT support will be necessary during the initial program launch, during the migration of legacy records, and during the continuous update process after records integration.</p>
<h3>Who is Medical Informatics?</h3>
<p>We are doctors, professors, and business leaders who have come together to forge a new paradigm in medical record-keeping.  But more importantly, we are also patients and consumers of health care ourselves.  We want better transparency and improved access to records, because we, too, are patients from time-to-time.</p>

We are grateful to our strategic corporate partners without whose hard work and effort, we would not be able to realize this dream.</p>
<p>We are also grateful to you, the Indiegogo community, for giving us this opportunity to showcase this project. Thank you for your support!<br/></p></span></span></span></span></div>","Imagine How You Can Change the Future of Medicine! 
Wouldn't it be great if you could look up your medical records as easily and securely as you would look up your checking account balance online?  Wouldn't it be useful, for example, to be able to print your child's immunization records on demand, even if the information came from different providers or different facilities?  Wouldn't it be incredible to receive real-time notifications when new test or lab results are posted to your medical record? 
And wouldn't it be mind-blowing to be able to access every medical document, produced by every provider, at every medical facility you've ever visited and be able to retain control over that information forever?
This project is the culmination of years of effort in bringing together the right people, developing the technological infrastructure and strategic partnerships, as well as defining the medical and legal framework to make this happen.
It is our hope that you will see the importance of this project and the significance of the role you can play in transforming the medical landscape of tomorrow.
As you read and learn about the ""My Medical Records"" Project, you will learn about the various elements necessary to bring together your records in one place. You will also learn how a Health Security Number is a prerequisite to bringing these records together. Your contributions will go directly to funding an open-sourced software portal which we will build using the proprietary technology we've already developed. By implementing this software solution, we will open the door to a whole new way of looking at medical records.



The Reality of Patient-Centered Care
The biggest obstacle with healthcare record integration is the absence of a ""Unique Patient Identifier"" (also known as a UPI). Without it, it is almost impossible to bring all of our records together from different providers and different facilities. A Unique Patient Identifier can be a medical record number, for example. It identifies you to your health care provider. Part of the problem, is that everybody uses a different Unique Patient Identifier to identify you.
Privacy advocates balk at the idea of having the government or any single group maintain a database of Unique Patient Identifiers. Our approach is uniquely different. We use a method of producing UPIs which does not involve databases. Only you and your providers know your UPI. Also, the data stored under the UPI is protected, so even if your UPI is lost or stolen, your health records are still protected.



Introducing Your Health Security Number
Our portal will provide you with your Health Security Number is without relying on on serialized numbers (i.e., numbers in a sequence), randomized numbers (which cannot be reproduced if lost or stolen) or numbers stored in a centralized database. When your Health Security Number is produced, it will only be known to you and your providers who know you.  Your Health Security Number will uniquely identify you to all of your providers including your doctors, dentists, pharmacists and other health care professionals.

<p>The filter on your heater and A/C helps keep your air clean in your house, but when it gets clogged, it causes your system to work harder than it has to, and less effectively at that. The Department of Energy says that a clean filter can reduce your HVAC energy consumption 5-15%. As the filter gets more clogged, you end up spending more and more on energy, and your air quality diminishes.</p>
<p>Most filters are sold with a suggested change date, but there’s two main problems with that: first, every house is different, so those suggestions might be right for some people and completely off for others, and in between for everyone else. Several factors determine how quickly your filter will become ineffective including the number of family members, pets, carpet, filter location, susceptibility to allergens, and home location just to name a few. Second, we sometimes forget when we installed a filter, or when the suggested date comes along to change them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139351/files/20131017153348-90days.JPG?1382049228"" src="""" style=""""/> </b></p>

<p></p>What results is extra stress on your HVAC (shortening its life), extra energy used (costing you money), and compromised indoor air quality. While some HVAC thermostats tell occupants when to change filters, those suggestions are based more on run time than on actual need, meaning you may change filters too frequently or too infrequently...as we said, all houses are different, so why not get the right answer, the one based on data?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/188055/files/20131110100014-ks9.JPG?1384106414"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>The Birth of FilterWatch</b></p><p>After getting fed up with $800 electricity bills, I realized that I had no real way to tell when the filters on my A/C needed changing. This has lead us here with FilterWatch, a simple device that measures how clogged your air filter is and alerts you when its time to be changed. FilterWatch monitors the airflow going into your filter. Slow airflow means less filtering and longer run times! When the airflow gets to be too slow, an alarm on the FilterWatch will go off. Simple and effective, and the benefits are huge!</p><p><b>Check this out</b></p><p>If your filter is clogged 20%, your HVAC runs 20% longer. So if your HVAC was running 5 hours a day with a new filter, its now running 6 hours a day. A typical HVAC unit will use 3kW in an hour. So figure that extra 1 hour will cost you $.30 if your service provider charges you $.1/kWh. That doesn't sound like a lot but...</p><ul>
<li>if you ran it that way for 30 days, that's $9 (for 1 extra hour every 24hrs). Over a year, it would amount to ~$100 if you’re consistently running your HVAC with a somewhat clogged filter. If your avg. price/kWh is $.15, that's $13.5 per month, or over $150 per year. In Hawaii, where electricity is about $0.35/kWh, you’re talking ~$350 per year!</li>
<li>if you have 2 HVAC units, double those figures.</li>
<li>if your system runs 15hrs/day in your peak season, triple them!</li>

<h1><em><strong>The Air that You Breathe</strong></em></h1>
<p>Indoor dust, mites, pollen, and dander are major triggers of asthma and other respiratory aliments. One of the best methods of limiting these allergens in your home, is to trap them in your HVAC filter.  As your air filters get clogged with these allergens, they become less and less effective. Lower air flow through the filter and poor seating due to flexing of the filter are just a couple reasons they become less effective at trapping particles.</p>
<p>Check out these asthma prevention methods on WebMD, making sure your filter is clean is right up there near the top and is certainly one of the least costly items to implement.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/prevention-home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">asthma prevention methods</a><br/></p>
<p>Are your HEPA filters protecting your family? They might be for a while, but they get clogged as well and their effectiveness is quickly reduced as the airflow is reduced by clogging. Many people install HEPA filters in systems that are marginally designed and the added filtering reduces the air speed to a point that many allergens are too heavy to be picked up by the filter system. The energy costs sky-rocket because the system runs longer. FilterWatch can help you decide what filter might be best for your system.</p>

<p><strong><em>When is the RIGHT TIME to change your air filters?</em></strong></p>
<p>Some people like to change their air filters every 30 days and why wouldn't you when the label on the air filter says ""30 day filter""?</p>
<p>Some people like to look through the return vent to see if the filter is dirty or 'bending'.</p>
<p>What if your air  filter is already 25% clogged after 30 days or when you look at it? Worse yet, what if you forget to check your filter for a couple extra weeks?</p>
<p>If  your air filter should be changed at 30 days because it is already 25% clogged and you wait until 60 days, You are likely wasting a minimum of $25 on your energy bill for that extra 30 days! (See chart below)</p>
<p>This link will take you to the study by Old Dominion University that shows the added cost of electricity each month given a 23% clogged air filter. It's over $13 per month with just 5 hrs of running per day at $.1 per kWh! A 20% increase over the cost of running with a clean air filter. A summer here in AZ and your system is probably running 12-16 hours a day! You can see that during our peak, its imperative to keep a clean filter.</p>

and pre-order your FilterWatch today!




The filter on your heater and A/C helps keep your air clean in your house, but when it gets clogged, it causes your system to work harder than it has to, and less effectively at that. The Department of Energy says that a clean filter can reduce your HVAC energy consumption 5-15%. As the filter gets more clogged, you end up spending more and more on energy, and your air quality diminishes.
Most filters are sold with a suggested change date, but there’s two main problems with that: first, every house is different, so those suggestions might be right for some people and completely off for others, and in between for everyone else. Several factors determine how quickly your filter will become ineffective including the number of family members, pets, carpet, filter location, susceptibility to allergens, and home location just to name a few. Second, we sometimes forget when we installed a filter, or when the suggested date comes along to change them.  

 

What results is extra stress on your HVAC (shortening its life), extra energy used (costing you money), and compromised indoor air quality. While some HVAC thermostats tell occupants when to change filters, those suggestions are based more on run time than on actual need, meaning you may change filters too frequently or too infrequently...as we said, all houses are different, so why not get the right answer, the one based on data?The Birth of FilterWatchAfter getting fed up with $800 electricity bills, I realized that I had no real way to tell when the filters on my A/C needed changing. This has lead us here with FilterWatch, a simple device that measures how clogged your air filter is and alerts you when its time to be changed. FilterWatch monitors the airflow going into your filter. Slow airflow means less filtering and longer run times! When the airflow gets to be too slow, an alarm on the FilterWatch will go off. Simple and effective, and the benefits are huge!Check this outIf your filter is clogged 20%, your HVAC runs 20% longer. So if your HVAC was running 5 hours a day with a new filter, its now running 6 hours a day. A typical HVAC unit will use 3kW in an hour. So figure that extra 1 hour will cost you $.30 if your service provider charges you $.1/kWh. That doesn't sound like a lot but...
if you ran it that way for 30 days, that's $9 (for 1 extra hour every 24hrs). Over a year, it would amount to ~$100 if you’re consistently running your HVAC with a somewhat clogged filter. If your avg. price/kWh is $.15, that's $13.5 per month, or over $150 per year. In Hawaii, where electricity is about $0.35/kWh, you’re talking ~$350 per year!
if you have 2 HVAC units, double those figures.
if your system runs 15hrs/day in your peak season, triple them!
Turns out while developing the prototypes, I learned my filters are 30-35% clogged after 20 days. So that $9 we started with, might actually be $15 depending on your own home’s individual usage. FilterWatch will pinpoint the best time for you to change your filter based on your situation. 
HVAC units can use anywhere between 2 and 5 kW depending on the size. We used 3 in our numbers above.
footnote: If you believe the numbers we used are high, check out your average electricity rate HERE.Just attach FilterWatch to a vent in your house (return vent is best), press the start button and wait for FilterWatch to alert you when your filter needs changing.I'm going to save a boat load of money and we expect a lot of you will as well whether its cooling in the summer or heating in the winter.Most of us will spend over 90% of our lives indoors and over 50% of that will be in our own homes. 

This makes our HVAC system(s) an integral part of our LIVES!
For most of us,  our HVAC system is the primary method for filtering the air that we breathe AND it is the #1 source of energy usage in our homes. With something so important in our lives, it makes sense that we should pay extra attention to make sure that it is working as efficiently as possible.

</div></div>","Short Summary My dad - Paul Emmanuel passed away in the ICU at Mt. Hope hospital on October 28th, 2014 in Trinidad. He had surgery on October 10th to remove a ruptured gallbladder at St. Clair Medical. His lungs became infected and he was rushed to the ICU at St. Clair on October 12th. His medical costs rose everyday.  
My name is Francesco Emmanuel - his son. My family lives in Trinidad. We have always been a very close-knit family. Losing our father was the hardest thing we've ever had to go through, especially as he suffered for almost three weeks. Every day we hoped he would be getting better, but instead his lungs never recovered, we had to move him from St. Clair to MT. Hope on October 22nd because the costs were way beyond our reach. He developed a secondary infection and went into cardiac arrest on October 27th, he slowly slipped away till his passing on October 28th, 2014. We have had a wonderful life with our father and we just cannot believe he's gone.

What we need
  
Currently, his medical bill is TTS273,000 (he was admitted Oct 9th, 2014), with the ICU costing approximately TTS20,000 - 25,000/day. We had no idea what the cost was until we got an interim bill the next day.  We're were desperately hoping he would be transferred to another ward by end of week, but instead we had to wait almost a week to get a bed in a public ICU, because his condition never really improved.  If we don't get the funds we will look into other fundraising options - family, friends, bank loans, concerts. 

What You GetI am a musician, and am working on a new solo record, which will be out early 2015. You can find out all about me at www.cescoemmanuel.com. I will gladly give my new album (and ALL my previous music) for free to anyone who contributes to this campaign.

IT IS</b></p>
<p>During my time as a chemistry student pursuing a
college degree, I saw first-hand how many students relied on energy drinks to
sustain them through their study sessions or keep them awake during work.  Energy beverages provided necessary energy,
but at the cost of huge amounts of sugar and a nasty tasting, toxic-looking
liquid.  Of course, sugarless versions
were available, but many of these just tasted even nastier!</p>
<p>Students in high school and college as well as
professionals in the working world rely on energy products in order to compete or even just to stay concurrent.  It is the sad truth that many students even
turn to illegally obtained prescription ADHD medications or other drugs to just
try to maintain their focus and motivation to get them through their day or
class.  There had to be an alternative
that didn’t require huge amounts of sugar, toxic tasting liquids, or illegal
drugs.  The concept of VimGum was born.</p>
<p>VimGum combines the potency of a leading 12 oz.
energy drink along with memory and cognitive enhancing nootropic “smart drugs”
(don’t worry, they are the legal kind) in the convenience and enjoyment of a
single piece of chewing gum. </p>
<p>VimGum contains a potent proprietary formula which
energizes, motivates, and enhances for several hours.  Now if you are thinking that VimGum is just a
caffeinated gum, you are dead wrong. 
VimGum contains powerful ingredients that will provide stimulation and
focus even to the person who has developed a tall tolerance to caffeine since the primary ingredients are not caffeine, although caffeine is also part of VimGum.  The unique formula is comprised of several
unique ingredients which work synergistically in vivo to produce a dynamic and
focused increase in energy, concentration, and drive.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But VimGum doesn’t stop there.  Unlike other energy products, VimGum also
contains a proprietary nootropic blend. 
For those of you who are unfamiliar, nootropics are substances which
increase mental acuity, memory, and problem-solving.  While a standard energy drink may be able to
keep you awake a little longer for your study session, VimGum will actually
help you learn faster and more comprehensively. 
Skeptical?  After just one piece,
you soon won’t be.</span><br/></p>
<p>We have established that VimGum is not your typical
energy product.  In addition to suiting
itself to academic study and professional work ability, VimGum also provides
physical stimulation that makes it useful for every athlete and for every work
out.  The stimulation and energy provided
mean that you are able to train harder, faster, longer, and with more vitality
than would otherwise be possible.  In
fact, VimGum contains a powerful blend of natural herbal extracts and modern
age chemistry that creates a powerful thermogenic effect that increases resting
metabolism so that even if you are doing nothing more than sitting at your desk
or lying on the couch, your resting metabolism will be increased over its
baseline so that your caloric expenditure will be higher.  What exactly does that mean?  Basically your metabolism will increase so
that fats are more readily broken down, cellular energy is more readily available,
and thus more energy is available to your body and mind.</p>
<p>So what exactly is in VimGum?  The individual ingredients include various
natural stimulants including caffeine, nootropics, vitamins, and thermogenic
substances; but the true “magic” is in the synergistic effect that the
substances produce in the human body when combined, allowing for an extremely
potent effect from such a small amount of material in a single piece of chewing
gum, especially when compared with the huge amounts of toxins and nasty
chemicals present in so many energy drinks. 
VimGum is based on extensive biochemical and nutrition research in order
to provide an energizing experience unlike any other.  Below is a description of the major active ingredients:</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>WHAT'S IN IT</b></p><p>-- B vitamins:  these are natural energy boosters which increase the body's metabolism of carbohydrates and fats to increase available energy levels*</p><p>-- Synephrine:  an extract of bitter orange, this chemical stimulates resting metabolism so that more energy is available.  This has dual effects; first, it enhances weight loss by increasing energy expenditure even when you are not exercising or exerting yourself, and second it provides additional available energy to your body and mind*</p><p>-- Yohimbine: extract of yohimbe, this powerful natural chemical is both a powerful stimulant and a mild aphrodisiac*</p><p>-- L-Theanine:  this nootropic chemical enhances working memory, improves learning curve, and smooths any jitters that exist from other stimulants*</p><p>-- Caffeine Anhydrous: caffeine works synergistically with the other natural energy chemicals to provide superior energy, but without the usual excessive jitteriness of other caffeine products and with an overall higher potency*</p><p>-- Huperzine A:  this powerful chemical increases mental acuity as well short-term memory*</p><p>-- Vinpocetine:  a powerful memory and cognitive enhancer, this compound provides clear benefits for any study or work session*</p><p>-- Ginseng:  a natural chinese herb, this plant contains natural, healthy stimulants and focus-enhancing compounds*</p><p>-- Noopept:  this incredibly powerful nootropic acts on the acetylcholine system of the brain, increasing long-term memory with regular use so that you can retain more information and for longer periods*</p><p>-- CDP Choline:  providing essential choline to the brain, CDP Choline replenishes the brain's supply of acetylcholine precursor which in turn allows the brain to encode memories more efficiently*</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHO
WE ARE</b></p>
<p>My name is Ricky, and I am currently a biochemistry and
physics double major at Florida State University.  After seeing just how much of a need there
was for energy drink alternatives besides illegal ADHD pills or speed, I came
up with the idea of developing a new energizing formula that was compact and
efficient, but would also provide incredible stimulation and focus to the
student, professional, or athlete.  After 16 months of research, development, and friends who put up with me while I made
them chew piece after piece, VimGum finally has a tasty yet powerful
composition which I want to now be able to share with the world.  Unfortunately, I am still a college student
working my way through school and cannot afford to move this project forward
anymore without help.  That’s where
you come in.</p>

Your donation to this campaign will help buy the air conditioner needed by Jane who has lung disease or will help her pay the larger electricity bill. 
Your donation will pay for new tires so Jim can drive to his part time job.
Your donation will buy a bus ticket so Sara can attend her mother's funeral in Madison.
Your donation will pay for the new refrigerator that Andy needs.
Your donation will help with the down payments needed so Amy can live in her own apartment.
What you get when you make a donation to the Jolly Ruby Fund is a unique hand crafted gift made by me.  We want to raise $10,000 and we know we can do it one donation at a time.  For a $500 donation, you'll receive an original lap-sized throw quilt, custom made for you.  For a $250 donation, I will send you a set of 4 placemats. With a $100 donation, you'll get a beautiful table runner.  For a $50 donation, you'll receive a 12"" table mat, and for a $25 donation, you'll receive a cute hand-made quilted pot holder.  More importantly, you'll receive the satisfaction of knowing that you have made a great difference in someones life.Every dollar in the Jolly Ruby Fund is spent on the unmet financial need of a person with a disability--there are no overhead costs with Jolly Ruby.  We want to raise $10,000 in the next 60 days.  If  we fall short of that goal, we'll still use your donation to help out as best as we can.  Even if you can't make a donation at this time, it would be great if you would share this information with others so we can reach as many people as possible in this campaign. And, of course, you can shop at my Etsy store, Jolly Ruby, any time of the year.  You'll get a beautiful quilted item for your home as well as contributing to the Jolly Ruby Fund.We have 60 days to reach our goal of $10,000. Please make your contribution now!  Thank you so much. Barb",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

and Love everyone. My name is Isis Brantley and I’m a Dallas native. For 25
years I’ve been a pillar of strength and fortitude in my community. My passion
is healing through the hair.  I’m known as the Matriarch and pioneer of
Natural Hair care and African Braiding in the State of Texas.  I have been
instrumental in changing unfair laws related to African Braiding rights and
Economic liberty.  I’m the Owner and Founder of The Institute of Ancestral
Braiding the only Natural Hair/ African Braiding School in Texas. Our purpose
is to train the next generation of African Braiders. </p>
<p>Since
1980, The Institute of Ancestral Braiding has positioned itself as a leader in
natural hair care and adornment advice, services, and products. This is a
cultural foundation created in the interest of women, men and children, across
the globe who are suffering with damaged hair, scalps, and low self esteem
because of these conditions. </p><p>Unlike our competitors we take a completely natural and holistic approach to healing one's head. We do not use over processed chemicals in any of our services and we take the time and care to make sure that all of the services we provide are genuinely advantageous for the customer, not solely for our profit.  <br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryMdWdKERcY?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p><b><i>Uniqueness/Distinction</i></b></p>

decides to change the negative thinking patterns about self image they will

their natural kinky hair instead of placing chemicals in it and damaging it in
order to obtain a commercial standard of beauty.</p>

<p>Good day Naturallyisis ...Omg! I just rushed to youtube after my
daughter showed me her hair in globs in the shower. She just happened to tell
me today...however I guess it started just 2 or 3 days after she decided to get
a wave noveau. I just tried to contact the stylist and salon she went to and I
received a voicemail. I left a message just stating my number and for a call
back. My daughter doesn't want me going there upset but I know for my daughter
to even tell me and show me the hair...there is(was) a problem but it's so much
hair! I'm afraid it's all going to be out within a matter of days or weeks if
it's coming out in clumps like this. Omg! She was so happy...her hair had grown
in it's natural state so long that she was so happy to get perm(wave noveau) to
celebrate the length. Please help me/my daughter. I know this traumatic for her
and for me. She tries to be tough but I know this is seriously effected her
. </p>
<p>I put the glob of hair in a ziplock bag and will be adding any
more hair that falls out in the meantime. Is there a lawsuit against loreal or
carson soft sheen? Please help? I'm still awaiting a call from the stylist to
find out if she used the brand products mentioned in your video with the other
woman who suffered from this unforturnate situation.</p>
<p>I advised my daughter to email you and she just said 'Mom there's
nothing anyone can do' and stop telling everyone. I yelled back to the room to
her minutes ago----I'm not telling everyone ..I'm looking for answers ...it's
your hair and this lady from what I see in the video is someone who knows
what's going on in the industry of Black hair products/damage etc.,</p>
<p>Mzchastang@yahoo.com is her email but I will again try to get her
to email you and watch the video..she's just baracaded herself in her room now
and I think I feel her pain worse than she. Probably nothing we(she) can do as
far as the hair stylist who applied the perm? Please contact me please at
 your soonest. Much regards peace respect love &amp; blessings </p>
