<h3>Help Us Help Kids Make God Their Target!</h3> <p>We have designed a series of Bible based journals for children ages 4-10.  Our mission is to help kids discover that following God's purpose is their target, and His Word is their guide. </p> <ul> <li>Hi!  My name is Karen, and am the proud mama of 3 kids, 10, 8 &amp; 20 months, and I've been blessed to call Isaac my man for the last 15 years.  I am the founder of a women's entrepreneur ministry called Pursuit Community, and the owner of an online journal shop called Intentional Home that helps women spend more time in God's Word, and bring organization, and intention to their days.  And now, I guess I can add children's journal maker to my list of things to juggle :) </li>
<li>Last year, shortly after we got our first shipment of women's journals, my children started asking me why it was only for grown up girls, and when they could have a journal made for them.   This sparked some interesting conversations which led to them sketching out what their journal pages would look like.  Eventually this game landed on the screen of my computer, with two excited kids by my side as we started making their sketches come to life.</li>
<li>The events of that afternoon led to a conversation with my friend Jordanne to see if she could add some fun to these pages with her gorgeous illustrations.  After tons of brainstorming, research, dreaming, and designing with our family and friends, the very first Archer's Adventure Journal was born.   At first we only did a summer journal, but after we got it printed, we fell even more in love with it.   We got to see first hand how it helped children build habits of spending time with God daily.  The journals made it fun to get in God's Word, and taught them how the Bible actually applied to their lives.   </li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Mountaintop Adventure</h3> <p>Here is the FUN part!  These Journals have truly created a Mountaintop experience for our family.  We have worked so hard over the past year designing, brainstorming, developing and now producing these journals.   The joy we've been able to see on children's faces as they used the summer journals, and the encouraging testimonies we've heard from parents &amp; teachers have us shouting from the roof as if we just climbed a HUGE mountain.  Because, well, we sort of did!</p> <ul> <li>After my children asked me for a journal of their own, I searched endlessly for something like this only to come up empty handed.  To our knowledge, Archer's Adventure Journal is the first Bible Based Guided Journal specifically designed for kids.  And THAT is something to get excited about!</li>
<li>As parents of 3 little ones, we know the importance of teaching them routines, and helping them cultivate good habits that will carry them throughout their lives and prayerfully lead them into responsible adulthood.  The very best thing we can teach our children is how to spend time with God, hear His voice, read His Word and apply it to their lives.  We truly believe that having a daily check-in tool like Archer's Adventure Journal where they are guided through His Word, and given prompts for further conversation will help them grow in their own faith, and become stronger and more confident in their relationship with Jesus.</li> <li>Isaac and I were both raised by Mother's who dedicated their lives to elementary education.  With over 75 years of teaching between the two of them, our sweet Mama's became sounding boards, developers, advisors, and our biggest cheerleaders on the planet.  They helped us create a unique book for children that was not only adorable and fun, but also structured, purposeful</li> <li>We utilized common core strategies to help children relate God's Word to their everyday life in a structured, predictable, and engaging way.  The journal gives children a chance to read, write, draw, and get in touch with their feelings.  And as a great bonus, it gives children the opportunity to write their very own book to be proud of.</li>
<li>A wonderful side-effect that we never anticipated was how the pages of these journals turned into windows into our children's hearts.  The things they have written, and the questions that they have asked since using the journals have been the greatest gift.  We've had the most incredible conversations, and learned so much about how to love them well, and support them best where they are at.   As a mama, I am seriously so thankful that I have this tool now.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The ""out on a limb"" Adventure...</h3> <p> It's true, we want to ensure that Archer makes it's way into the hands of hundreds of children across the country no matter what.</p> <ul> <li>This spring we released a 13 week Summer Edition of the Archer Adventure Journal.  The journals sold out in 4 days and we quickly had a waiting list of several hundred people that wanted to get in line for the School Year Journal.</li>
<li>When we looked into production, that is when we hit our first obstacle.  Because we were adding about 300 pages to the journal, AND making it hard cover, the costs went up dramatically.  It started to become very apparent that we either wouldn't be able to make the journal, or if we did, they would be VERY expensive, and out of reach for many families.  With our target being to retail the journals for less than $25, we knew we had to figure out something.  As it turns out, if you make a very large order, the cost drops dramatically, but that also comes with a huge risk and an expense that we simply can't afford. </li> <li>We want to continue seeing Archer help children grow in their relationship with the Lord.  We want to see kids understanding the Bible in new ways, and learning how it applies to their everyday lives.  But we need your help.   Every bit of the money that we are able to raise through this campaign will go towards production costs for the journals, and will simultaneously help lower the retail price of the books for families and schools.  </li> </ul>

</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">According to statistics reported by ABC News, nearly 30% of students are either bullies or victims of bullying, and 160,000 kids stay home from school every day because of fear of bullying.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>“One in six American schoolchildren report being bullied verbally, physically and online, two to three times a month or more, many for more than a year.<br/>That’s a fact.</p>
<p>Remember that bullying is symptomatic of a much deeper wound. If we allow it to continue to fester, the symptoms will only increase in severity. They will not go away. By failing to intervene, we forgo an opportunity to stem a tide that will, in time, wash ashore with a force more powerful and more violent than previously possible.”</p>

According to statistics reported by ABC News, nearly 30% of students are either bullies or victims of bullying, and 160,000 kids stay home from school every day because of fear of bullying.

“One in six American schoolchildren report being bullied verbally, physically and online, two to three times a month or more, many for more than a year.That’s a fact.
Remember that bullying is symptomatic of a much deeper wound. If we allow it to continue to fester, the symptoms will only increase in severity. They will not go away. By failing to intervene, we forgo an opportunity to stem a tide that will, in time, wash ashore with a force more powerful and more violent than previously possible.”
Joaquin Phoenix, ActorUSA Today Column, 8/12/2012


We offer a unique feature for positive social support to children affected by bullying.  Lets stop or at least minimize this tragedy together.

<p>The time is now. If we do nothing, these unwarranted parole
denials will continue to translate into extended years of incarceration, with
a crippling impact that is felt far beyond prison walls:  </p>
<p>1. 
<b>Children
and Families:</b> Nearly 80,000 children in New York State have at
least one parent in prison; most live in low-income communities of color. As
the separation due to incarceration is unreasonably lengthened, these children experience
a sense of loss that—because of stigma and the lack of compassion—is often more
crippling than other causes of parental loss. They become more likely to have health
problems, both physical and mental, and sometimes exhibit aggressive, antisocial
behavior that leads to jail. Families struggle to stay connected to
incarcerated loved ones, but visits typically require long hours of travel and
money that’s in short supply. Collect calls can be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>2. 
<b>The Community:</b>
As certain communities in New York continue to experience unreasonable parole
denials, the socio-economic impact is shattering. These areas endure stigmatization,
a dearth of economic development, heightened poverty, political disempowerment
and widespread community decay. They become marginalized hubs for excessive
policing. They become breeding grounds for despair and desperation.</p>
<p>3. 
<b>The
Economy: </b>Taxpayers are
overburdened by unjust parole denials. People returning from extended
incarceration lose about 40% of their earning potential and are often compelled
to seek public assistance at taxpayers’ expense. Repeatedly denying parole to
thousands of community-ready men and women results in lost tax revenues, high
government payouts and drains on essential services. When people remain incarcerated
well into their senior years, the economic impact is even more adverse. </p>

<h2>In short</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The environment of this card game is the <b>classroom</b>.</p>
<p>Using a collaborative/cooperative methodology in an informal 
educational setting, it was planned to <b>motivate</b> and engage students. <br/></p>
<p>It is for 
learning about <b>atoms structure and The Periodic Table of the elements</b>.<br/><br/>It can be played in <b>5 different</b> ways in <b>10 levels</b> of expertise.<br/><br/>It has individual workout exercise sheets for educational procedure <b>automation</b>.<br/><br/>It can also be used within the <b>family</b> like a quiz card game.<br/><br/>At this moment its a <b>prototype</b>. To improve his design and produce it we need your help.<br/><br/>Help this happen next <b>December</b>.</p>Thank You!<br/><br/><h2>more:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goal: more isotopes then the other teams<br/>
</li>
<li>2 role playing: <strong>judges</strong> and <strong>players</strong> </li>
<li>up to 25 students playing at the same time<br/>
</li>
<li>Students grouped up to 6 teams of 3 elements 
each</li>
<li>Judges can be  up to 7<br/>

<h3>Why?</h3> <p></p>
<p>I feel fortunate when students says ""The lesson his going to end!? Already? Let me finished this, please, one more minute, please!? Teacher."" I often ear this whenever I use this and other card games or online games. That's when I feel great, <b>helping others</b> to learn something very important, to gain confidence and acquire meaningful knowledge, with happiness and engagement. <br/></p>

<b><h2>Experience<br/>
</h2></b>Since 1992 I've been teaching. After 2000 I start to use cooperative games that promote team building. Short after, I plan to use this methodology within the classroom to teach Science. Most of the classes were very receptive, 20% didn't like it. I continue to use it but I complemented it with the pedagogical materials that the game have.
<p>Short after this, I found that if I adapted pedagogical materials in a kind of ""game"" structure, with levels and hands-on approach, students engage in the process. As this practice went on, I found that this type of work was very helpful to promote the automation of procedures.</p>
<p>Last semester I took a short course on gamification at EDX ""MITx: 11.127x Design and Development of Games for Learning"" and discover same other strategies that I could use to adapt once again the materials that I have used in classroom.<br/></p>
<p>At this moment, the card game is a stable and playful activity and we decided to share it,  hoping to find people interested in using and develop it.</p>
<p>The issue we have to solve its about the mailing. So, we have to decide what type of design we will use to make the game short and lighter enough to cu the costs</p>
<p>Another issue its about the overall design of the game. If we reach the 5000 euros, we will hire a designer to make sure that the game its more user friendly and beautiful. It makes sense, its for beautiful persons!</p>

</ul><br/></div>","In short

The environment of this card game is the classroom.
Using a collaborative/cooperative methodology in an informal 
educational setting, it was planned to motivate and engage students. 
It is for 
learning about atoms structure and The Periodic Table of the elements.It can be played in 5 different ways in 10 levels of expertise.It has individual workout exercise sheets for educational procedure automation.It can also be used within the family like a quiz card game.At this moment its a prototype. To improve his design and produce it we need your help.Help this happen next December.Thank You!more:

Goal: more isotopes then the other teams

2 role playing: judges and players 
up to 25 students playing at the same time

Students grouped up to 6 teams of 3 elements 
each
Judges can be  up to 7

50% will fund a mini Fab Lab ""Open Lab"": lababerto.wordpress.com


Available in Portuguese.


Why? 
I feel fortunate when students says ""The lesson his going to end!? Already? Let me finished this, please, one more minute, please!? Teacher."" I often ear this whenever I use this and other card games or online games. That's when I feel great, helping others to learn something very important, to gain confidence and acquire meaningful knowledge, with happiness and engagement. 




Games engage and motivate students to learn. Cooperative learning its powerful. Why not merge them? For procedures automation we include pedagogical materials.
This card game its about atoms, ions and isotopes, and it as also pedagogical material to elaborate learning about this subject at a introductory level and for procedures automation. It as 10 levels of expertise and 4 different ways to play with.

Even though I am blessed more than I deserve, I will never forget about my past and childhood in Afghanistan. Growing up in poverty as a child taught me to have empathy toward every kid and older people who is suffering from poverty and harsh environment. When I was young, my family lived  in cold tents and on refugee camps for a few years. There were nights that my siblings and I went to bed hungry. Knowing the harsh consequences of the winter season in Afghanistan, I have  decided to launch a fundraising program to help the the poor families around the Kabul city. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>My goals is to raise $10,000. This money will be used for wood, food, medicine, blankets and school supplies. Each family will get $200 to buy wood and food (rice, wheat, oil) and an additional $100 for blankets and school supplies. I will be visiting these families personally and delivering their gifts.  Also, I am asking and planning to make small bags of gifts that will have toys and candies which will be delivered to the kids living on the streets as Christmas presents from their friends in the United States. I want them to know that all around the world, people do care and are aware of what they are going through and that they are not alone.  I am sure that there are many who would love to take part in this in sharing their Christmas with the kids. </p>
<p>I am aware that reaching this goal may be difficult but this is something I really feel passionate about and would like to do. With Christmas coming in two months, I am hoping that everyone that can contribute will take part in it. Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. You can always contribute to my campaign through getting the word out. </p>Thank you!<br/>

</b><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.humanityafrica.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Humanity Africa</a> is a not-for-profit
organisation. Our flagship project <a href=""http://humanityafrica.org.uk/project-mazao/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#ProjectMazao</a> aims to alleviate poverty by
equipping farmers with agricultural input and training in Zambia. </p>
<p>Project Mazao involes rural farmers by giving them input and training. </p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>Farmers use this to feed their
families and with the training create small enterprises. </p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>Farmers then sell these products to Humanity Africa at a fair price. </p>
<p>3.<span>  Humanity Africa</span> then sells this to
markets for a small profit. </p>
<p>4.<span> 
</span>With these profits Humanity Africa supports more rural farmers. </p>
<p>We have learned that the best way to help people is not by providing
them aid in the form of food and clothes etc, but to teach them <b>HOW</b> to
produce food and be self-reliant.</p>
<p>To this day, Humanity Africa has been supported
by three corporate sponsors. We are supported by the Zambian Ministry of
Agriculture, who have faith in our intentions and work. Companies have invested (between 2014-2015) over £35,000 in research, acquiring land to develop our
projects and support amazing volunteers on the ground. Every year <a href=""http://humanityafrica.org.uk/volunteers-hall-of-fame/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">volunteers</a> give over thousands of hours of volunteer time to work with us. </p>
<p>Would you give if you knew your gift lasted forever? Are you ready to donate?</p><p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What YOU Get</b></p>
<p></p><p>The entire project costs £119,000, but we'd be ecstatic to raise £25,000.
We have already invested £35,000 into the project already through our corporate
sponsors. </p>
<p>We want to reach our goal. The more we raise
the more farmers we can work with. So if we raise £50,000, we help 200 farmers.
If we raise £100,000, we help 400 farmers and if we raise a MILLION, we help a
few villages of farmers.<b> But nothing will happen without your support. </b></p><p></p>
<p><b>SO
WHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO? </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447349809/y5akflva8yvkdfmbsyrz.png"" src="""" style=""width: 581.06px; height: 566px;""/></p>
<p></p><p>Our corporate sponsors cover
ALL ADMIN COSTS, which means...</p>
<p>Of every pound you give 70p
goes directly to the farmer's training and empowerment.</p>
<p>The remaining 30p goes toward
developing high yielding environmentally sustainable crops and livelihoods
(including poultry and livestock) to make it £2.10 to give to 3 farmers. Check

Zambia, supporting one farmer means supporting an entire family. The world
would be a better place if this could happen in all corners of the globe. 
<p>If a
family becomes self reliant they will be able to send their kids to school and
put food on the table.</p>
<p>We are
not just bringing them out of poverty we are helping them to defeat hunger and
gain education.</p>
<p>We believe and know that one big push will allow us
to create and help develop enough opportunities in the field to make sure rural
farmers can:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Harvest their crops and sell them at a fair price
so they can keep profits</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Train on intercropping and crop rotation so that
they are never short on food </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Feed their families and send their children to
school </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Be paid fair wages when they choose to work on
other people's farms</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Be ambassadors of their own transformation</p>

Humanity Africa is a not-for-profit
organisation. Our flagship project #ProjectMazao aims to alleviate poverty by
equipping farmers with agricultural input and training in Zambia. 
Project Mazao involes rural farmers by giving them input and training. 
1. 
Farmers use this to feed their
families and with the training create small enterprises. 
2. 
Farmers then sell these products to Humanity Africa at a fair price. 
3.  Humanity Africa then sells this to
markets for a small profit. 
4. 
With these profits Humanity Africa supports more rural farmers. 
We have learned that the best way to help people is not by providing
them aid in the form of food and clothes etc, but to teach them HOW to
produce food and be self-reliant.
To this day, Humanity Africa has been supported
by three corporate sponsors. We are supported by the Zambian Ministry of
Agriculture, who have faith in our intentions and work. Companies have invested (between 2014-2015) over £35,000 in research, acquiring land to develop our
projects and support amazing volunteers on the ground. Every year volunteers give over thousands of hours of volunteer time to work with us. 
Would you give if you knew your gift lasted forever? Are you ready to donate?
What We Need & What YOU Get
The entire project costs £119,000, but we'd be ecstatic to raise £25,000.
We have already invested £35,000 into the project already through our corporate
sponsors. 
We want to reach our goal. The more we raise
the more farmers we can work with. So if we raise £50,000, we help 200 farmers.
If we raise £100,000, we help 400 farmers and if we raise a MILLION, we help a
few villages of farmers. But nothing will happen without your support. 
SO
WHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO? 
Our corporate sponsors cover
ALL ADMIN COSTS, which means...
Of every pound you give 70p
goes directly to the farmer's training and empowerment.
The remaining 30p goes toward
developing high yielding environmentally sustainable crops and livelihoods
(including poultry and livestock) to make it £2.10 to give to 3 farmers. Check
out our video!
In social enterprises, your
gifts are multiplied, because we are investing in the future and not just the
present.  

The Impact
In
Zambia, supporting one farmer means supporting an entire family. The world
would be a better place if this could happen in all corners of the globe. 
If a
family becomes self reliant they will be able to send their kids to school and
put food on the table.
We are
not just bringing them out of poverty we are helping them to defeat hunger and
gain education.
We believe and know that one big push will allow us
to create and help develop enough opportunities in the field to make sure rural
farmers can:
· 
Harvest their crops and sell them at a fair price
so they can keep profits
· 
Train on intercropping and crop rotation so that
they are never short on food 
· 
Feed their families and send their children to
school 
· 
Be paid fair wages when they choose to work on
other people's farms
· 
Be ambassadors of their own transformation
Our team
includes international development experts who give their time voluntarily and
are committed to supporting rural Zambian farmers in a sustainable way.  You can contact the team with all your
questions and we will be delighted to answer them all.
PERKSSign up for your perks on our perks page!Risks & Challenges
The project’s external risks involve:
Not raising a substantial amount of money, thus
delaying the project
Climate change issues impacting growth of crops
How we aim to tackle them: 
We have to raise funds through different means 
Introduce poultry and livestock along with
agriculture to reduce shocks of climate change impact.

A RETURN TO NATURE & A RETURN TO INNOCENCE PROJECT
A flash back to daily rural and cultural life during the past in Rhodes, Greece (late 19th - early 20th century) ""Kaminari Park"", an open-air park and museum of more than 25 acres, allows visitors to experience the traditions and activities of village life in the Dodecanese islands through nature and agrotourism. It includes activities and synergies and offers every visitor the ideal place to live and experience a natural, traditional and healthy way of life. 
""Kaminari Park"" follows the era of innocence, simplicity and originality. By recalling the actual living and working conditions that the villagers of Rhodes experienced up until the middle of the 20th century, we point out that the values of life have not been separated from our roots. These values will be the fundamental principles leading to the rebirth  of our country. 
A visit to kaminari is a journey back to our roots, which makes the present a reflection to  our past. A journey full of experiences, activities, memories and sentiments.


In order to accomplish this project and to achieve our goals,we need your contribution and financial support.PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
To designate the hidden treasures our villages have by focusing on the attempts to preserve customs, traditions and skills of local villagers’ ancestors. 
To keep alive and revive memories from the past. 
To step into our Greek heritage which many Greek immigrants have held close to  their hearts after leaving the Aegean islands years ago seeking a new and better life abroad. 
To demonstrate and re-enact traditional occupations and skills. To teach, inspire and instruct young generations through relevant courses and activities.
To praise and honor, individually or through their associations, all our compatriots who live abroad and support our homeland all these years. 

The visitors will have the unique opportunitiesa. To experience the flora and fauna of the area or to gain permaculture experience.b. To visually see displays and re-enactments of activities from the past relevant to farming and non-existent traditional occupations including methods of producing local goods, authentic tools and  other items which were used by the farmers in their daily productive lives. 


In this way, they can live and experience skills such as:

traditionally producing bread (from  threshing wheat  to baking) and local foods 
cultivation of crops 
production of dairy products (local cheeses) and  the process of milking 
 preparing  sweets from local fruits, using traditional methods 
 harvesting and collecting wild herbs, utilizing an Herb Essential Oil Distiller, and soap making 
 picking of olives for the production of olive oil 
 production of lime made by heating limestone 
 traditional charcoal making 
 presentation of shoe making, carpentry and blacksmith skills 
 traditional sewing of local costumes and broadloom weaves 
 making pottery

c. To attend courses and workshops about: pottery, wood-crafts, soap making, bread making and permaculture.d. To see vintage photograph exhibitions  presenting  daily activities and life from the past , to admire artistic creations as well as  documents concerning the period of Italian occupation of the villages  around the Kaminari area.e. To participate in the revival of the traditional wedding ceremony. 
Supporting tradition and aiming to bring you closer to it, we offer you a traditional wedding ceremony locally called “antigamos” in our Eco Park “Kaminari”. This ceremony will be inspired from the wedding of our grandparents and will revive tradition, music and customs that people in our village used to have years ago in their wedding ceremonies. Scenes  from the past, derived from the roots of our families , will become the link between tradition and new generations in the beginning of their new life. DESCRIPTION OF THE AREAThe area consists of an open-air park of more than 25 acres, representing tradition and nature. All construction has been designed to utilize the natural environment, in adhering to the local and traditional methods of construction. The main materials used are stones, soil, clay, wood and mortar. The park is created in a way to allow one to experience the original architecture and design of the villages on the island. It consists of small traditional buildings as they were built in the past in the villages.  As you walk through the park, the surrounding area will display the naturally growing fauna and flora found on the island of Rhodes. 


HOW HAS OUR PROJECT BEEN FUNDED SO FAR?
The project started in 2011 and up to this point we have completed  75% of it. For the total cost of  350,000 euros we have already invested  200,000 euros of our own capital and 62,500 euros subsidized by European Programmes. Following the guidelines regarding investment policies by the Greek government, we had secured a loan with the Dodecanese Bank for the remaining 25% (87,500 euros). Unfortunately, the bank filed bankruptcy and the remaining funding was lost. Therefore we are seeking alternative funding in order to complete our project. We feel this project has its merits and we are determined to see its completion.


HOW WILL YOUR PLEDGE BE SPENT? Your money will be spent on the following: 
Completion of the display and exhibition place for the local products (15,000 euros) 
Equipment for the old olive oil mill (8,000 euros) 
Reconstruction of the old lime kiln (2,000 euros) 
Landform and landscaping (10,000 euros) 
Planting (3,000 euros) 
Equipment for traditional, nonexisting occupations: shoe maker, forger, carpenter, potter, tailor, barber (2,000 euros each ~ total 12,000 euros) 
If we can surpass our goal, the extra money will go to additional construction works that we have excluded from our initial building budget. An extra 25,000-35,000 euros above our goal will allow us to complete the constructing works including the icon painting and religious items for the church dedicated to the people of Rhodes who live abroad –Our DIASPORA (10,000 euros). Also, the biological waste water treatment system (4,500 euros), the equipment for solar energy (8,500 euros), FreeFlo water recycling system (10,000 euros) and the equipment for the distillery (2,500 euros) can be funded. 



Make a pledge We need to reach our funding goal by January  31st, 2016. If you would like to help make this project a reality, please make a pledge to help us get a step closer to reaching that goal. The grand opening of Kaminari Park is scheduled for April 2016.

<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>
<p> For approximately the last eight years, Greece has been suffering
from a deep and multifaceted social crisis. The most tangible
manifestation of the crisis is the financial one, which has deprived
millions of citizens from access to basic goods. In their attempt to
deal with this situation, more and more citizens are getting involved
into self-organised solidarity collectivities. One of these is the
Social Conservatory.</p>
<p>
The Social Conservatory was founded in Athens in the end of 2011. Its
main activity is free music lessons to students from families
otherwise unable to afford them. The teachers work as volunteers
without any remuneration. Every year an average of 40 volunteers
(teachers and people involved into other activities) and of 80
students, mostly minors, pass from the Conservatory’s classrooms.
Some of Greece’s top musicians, e.g. former members of the ERT
(Greek Radio – Television) Symphony Orchestra, fired after the
latter’s sudden closure by the government, are included in the
ranks of our teachers. Classical music dominates the curriculum, but
modern, traditional and ……..
are also taught.</p>

ATHENS SOCIAL CONSERVATORY

Who we are.
We are volunteers and music teachers, a group of ordinary people with two things in common: love for music and solidarity for the others. 
In 2011, at the beginning of the economic crisis in Greece, we decided to join forces for a common goal: communicate free of charge our art to those who can't afford traditional music courses. Thus was founded the Athens Social Conservatory, in order to give everyone access to music education, regardless of their economical means. 

What we do.

In Athens Social Conservatory, every year, volunteer music teachers give lessons, without any payment, to over 80 children and adolescents. We give lessons of classical, modern and traditional music, theory classes, preparatory music classes and choir. Since 2013, the Conservatory has found its permanent home in Byron, Athens. Little by little, financed by donations from volunteers and friends of the Social Conservatory, we equipped the place with musical instruments and teaching material. We can proudly claim that now the Social Conservatory can provide as complete musical education as a normal Conservatory.


What we need.

However, as the Social Conservatory grows, its needs increase.  Our funds, risen exclusively by volunteers and friends, are insufficient to meet even the most functional expenses. There is now a real danger that the whole project comes to a financial impasse.


With the funds raised by this campaign we will be able to cover our ​​operating costs, to preserve and repair musical instruments, to buy books, educational material and a decent computer (yes, Intel Pentium still exists in a suburb of Athens!!)  and to organize some events in order to promote the work of Conservatory to the society. Your contribution is important to continue to offer free musical education to dozens of children who cannot afford it. 


Other ways to help.
But even if you don't have the financial ability, you can help in many other ways: become a volunteer, help us in the organization and maintenance of the place, participate to the events that we organize. You can get updates on our actions and events from our blog (http://koinwnikowdeio.blogspot.gr/) or our facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/koinwniko.wdeio).


Short Summary

 For approximately the last eight years, Greece has been suffering
from a deep and multifaceted social crisis. The most tangible
manifestation of the crisis is the financial one, which has deprived
millions of citizens from access to basic goods. In their attempt to
deal with this situation, more and more citizens are getting involved
into self-organised solidarity collectivities. One of these is the
Social Conservatory.

The Social Conservatory was founded in Athens in the end of 2011. Its
main activity is free music lessons to students from families
otherwise unable to afford them. The teachers work as volunteers
without any remuneration. Every year an average of 40 volunteers
(teachers and people involved into other activities) and of 80
students, mostly minors, pass from the Conservatory’s classrooms.
Some of Greece’s top musicians, e.g. former members of the ERT
(Greek Radio – Television) Symphony Orchestra, fired after the
latter’s sudden closure by the government, are included in the
ranks of our teachers. Classical music dominates the curriculum, but
modern, traditional and ……..
are also taught.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>Namaste. My
name is Anica James and I am a documentary photographer, currently based in
Halifax, Nova Scotia. Exactly one year ago, I was living in Kathmandu, Nepal,
where I interned with the Nepal Epilepsy Association for three months, <a href=""http://www.anicajames.com/nepilepsy#0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">focusing on a photography project documenting the medical side of epilepsy in the country</a>. </p>
<p>
I
know what it is like firsthand to have epilepsy. 
While I was working with
the NEA, I was confronted with the many hardships faced by people with epilepsy,
especially living in a developing nation where their government does not give any
funding towards their healthcare system. Many of the patients with epilepsy have to take
medicine on a daily basis in order to control their seizures, but now, due to the
recent and devastating earthquake on April 25, 2015, thousands of people are displaced, and do not have access to the
medical care that they need. </p>
<p>This
campaign is important to me because epilepsy is a commonly overlooked disorder, yet
it affects over 50 million people worldwide. I am asking for your help because
now, more than ever, the people in Nepal need donations for medical
aid and I truly believe that together, we can make a difference. </p>
<p><b><br/>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>My goal is to raise $20,000, in which 100% of the money will be given directly to the Nepal Epilepsy Association to help their patients affected by
the earthquake. The money will be used by the associations staff, most of whom represent the only neurosurgeons in
Nepal, to purchase and distribute medicine, replace medical equipment and
generators, and to help repair and rebuild their medical clinics that have been damaged.<br/>
<br/>
In exchange for your donation of $100, you will receive a signed, limited
edition 8”x10” photographic giclée print, which you can select from the images
posted below. I have carefully selected the images in order to showcase not
only what life was like in Nepal, but to also show historical buildings that
are no longer there. <br/>
<br/>
Each photograph will be printed on <a href=""http://www.hahnemuehle.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/dfa/datenblaetter_dfa/WilliamTurner-Rev04.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hahnemühle William Turner 310 cotton rag paper</a> with UltraChrome inks, assuring you that you will be receiving the
highest quality product, thanking you in exchange for your donation to this
important cause. My sponsor, <a href=""http://atlanticphotosupply.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atlantic Photo Supply</a>, are generously covering all
of the printing costs for this project to ensure that 100%
of your donation will be going directly to the Nepal Epilepsy Association and
the victims of the earthquake. Prints will be delivered before the end of June 2015.

<p>The earthquake on April 25, 2015  has devastated much of Nepal and has affected neighbouring countries. In Nepal, a country of roughly 28 million
people, approximately 30, 000 have sought treatment for seizure

not received treatment. </p>
<p>Nepal is a beautiful
country, famous for its stunning, mountainous landscape, rich culture and
generous hospitality, yet a significant percentage of people live in poverty,
and most people are dependent on agriculture for a living. There are less
than twenty neurologists in the whole country, and for those living with
epilepsy life can be very isolating and
overwhelming. 
Access to medication,
support from specialists, 
and community understanding
of this highly stigmatized condition is very limited to many.<br/></p>
<p>Due to the earthquake, people are now running out of the medication
they need and some patients are now homeless. Head injuries, lack of
water and sleep, as well as high levels of stress can cause seizures, which is a constant fear for some epileptics. Many of Nepal's epileptics live in
remote rural areas of the country, where the access roads have been destroyed or blocked by the
earthquake and its aftershocks, making it even more difficult for them to receive the specific modern
medical aid they need. <br/>

mission is to provide opportunities to children in Latin America through
education in Computer Science and Olympic sport values
In February of 2015, the Roberto
Carcelen Foundation opened the doors of a new educational laboratory in Lima,
Peru. The lab’s focus is to provide the children of Lima with a place where
they can acquire the tools they need to build a brighter future.
Currently our educational lab
focuses on programs associated with computer science, English language
proficiency, leadership values and life lessons learned though the practice of
athletics. We believe that investing in the lives of these children will ensure
that we are helping to create a positive future for Latin America.


We provide
free education on computer science.
     Our students learn how to code and getting their hands on real projects.
     Our group of developer trainers involve the students on practical problem
     solving projects through programming.

Our children are learning English as well! We have two great English native speakers that provide
     English lessons.
We
     not only provide a technical curriculum in coding but we also assist with providing nourishment by ways of a
     warm daily breakfast


We provide
work opportunities for the older
     teenagers to join the workforce as a web developer.

Our U.S and Peru based mentors are leaders, CEO's,
     athletes that connect with our students
     via Skype twice a month to demonstrate the children that anything is
     possible and we all care about them. 
This
     is where our children will be working when finishing our program. Where
     our students will have the
     opportunity to provide (paid) services, but also provide company
     culture and values that make great companies thrive.

Why We Need Your Support?

Our 2016 program starts on September 2016. 31 Students have signed up and another 48 are in waiting list. We have opened an afternoon shift to serve those kids that work in the mornings. We are forecasting 100+ graduates by the end of the 2016 calendar year and our goal is to have 70% of them joining the workforce throughout 2016 and 2017 as web developers !
Keep in mind that $297 funds our computer science program (read more below) per student for a full year! This is
$25 at month/per student!

Who Do We Help?
Since the start of the year, 90
children have been enrolled in our free education programs.

70% are girls.
They come from extreme poor areas (Cantagallo and
     others nearby)
Our first group graduated last September, 60% of them
     are now working for companies engaged with our mission. They are now
     bringing revenue to their household empowering and helping their overall
     realities.

Outreach Programs

Mobile Lab: We bring our education to children
located in remote areas of Lima. 



Workshops: Technology and native language preservation. Most our
students migrated from remote rural areas, their primary language is not Spanish. We
partnered with The Idea Agency and the Office of human inclusion of Ministry of
Culture to bring awareness and practice to the importance of preserving
their own identity. As a result, our children are now coding and developing in
their own native languages in addition to Spanish. 


Outreach: Bringing Code.org program 'Hour of Code' to schools and
recreational events.



Events: We partnered with Microsoft Peru to bring Developer Days.
Our students got to interact with other techies, attended seminars and
presented their prototypes. 

The
Challenging Context
In Latin American countries, the
vast majority of children in relative poverty also suffer from extreme degrees
of absolute deprivation, making the challenge of child poverty all the more
urgent. In fact, in all but three countries (Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay),
over half of all children below the relative poverty line live in families
which do not have sufficient income for a proper diet.
· 
Latin America has the world's
highest levels of social inequality 
· 
91% of Children in poverty in Peru
do not have access to a college education.
· 
Fewer than half the girls in the
developing world will never reach secondary school.
Barriers
Recruitingo People from these communities are resistant and doubtful about accepting help. We had to find a way to break through this barrier.o  We decided to do onsite recruiting, Roberto Carcelen along with the team visited Cantagallo community and went door to door explaining the education opportunity and how it could break that multi-generational poverty cycle. It took time to gain their trust, but in the end it worked out, (certainly Roberto being an Olympic athlete helped). Our first group of graduates from Cantagallo was the best proof for them that our program works.

What We Need We have already set aside a scholarship fund that can sponsor 10 Greek students on our Web Development and UX Design program.  In order to make an even greater impact, we would like to offer 40 more young Greek women and men the chance to study with us at no cost. To do this, we need your help to fundraise an additional €32.000 to cover the minimum online mentors and operational costs to provide another 40 online mentored tech courses for free to Greek nationals.


For these 40 places we will offset 50% of the cost of the course, and the remaining 50% we hope to raise through donations on this page, to cover the minimum mentor and operational costs. CareerFoundry will not make any profit and we will contribute a lot of resources to make this happen.


If we don’t raise all the money, we will still use the available funds to offer a scholarship to as many students as possible. 



The Impact

Your donation will help us train your Greeks in tech skills so they can launch their new careers. This will help them become financially independent. And since many tech jobs can be done remotely, their money stays in Greece, further reviving the Greek economy. In time, we hope these folks will start their own businesses, and attract more talent and money to Greece. In the long run, this will make Greece financially secure so they can rely less on banks and become a more solvent state.

Donate now to educate 50 Greek Tech Leaders!

Join us in our mission to help young Greek women and men get out of the crisis. Please donate whatever you can to this Indiegogo page--even the price of a coffee could help.

</div><p>My name is Yousef Qaraeen, and I'm a 19 year old Palestinian from East Jerusalem. I recently completed my freshman year at the Eastern Mediterranean University in Cyprus, majoring in Communications and Journalism. Thankfully, with a lot of hard work and dedication, I was able to finish with a CGPA of 3.5 and receive a high-honors award. It's important to note that this was only possible because exactly one year ago I started a fundraising campaign on this exact website that made it possible for me to pay my college fees. This is my story:</p><p>Ever since I was young, I always had a passion for reading and writing, and as I grew older I realized that I could use writing as a method to share the stories of my people, and hopefully one day make a change in my community. I began to write poetry at an early age, and in high school I won first place in two slam poetry competitions (video above). Furthermore, my love for poetry introduced me to song-writing, and ever since I was 13 I've been making music to spread the word about the oppression and struggle that my people go through. </p><p>In addition, in 2013, I attended a summer camp in Maine, USA, known as Seeds of Peace, that revolved around ongoing conflicts in the world, specifically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. During my time there, I learned that compromise and sacrifice are vital if we ever want to reach a mutual understanding with one another, and that sometimes it is more important to listen than it is to speak. Seeds of Peace strengthened my passion for my country, and introduced me to possibilities that I never knew existed before leaving Palestine. (Most importantly, it introduced me to incredible people that donated to my previous campaign and supported my cause with everything they had.) After my high-school graduation in 2014, I chose to attend the American University of Dubai to further continue my learning.</p><p>During my time in Dubai, I was exposed to a completely different world than the one I had seen in Palestine. I never had to fear being harassed at checkpoints, and I never had to worry about soldiers randomly stopping me to ask whether I had been incarcerated or not. Life there was simple, and I maintained high grades in all of my courses. I was an avid member of the Palestinian Culture Club, and I joined the university basketball team. Unfortunately, though, my education in Dubai was limited to one semester because the university offered no financial aid, and the money that my father had paid for me to attend my first semester left him in a great amount of debt. That is when I was faced with the greatest challenge of my life. My parents told me that there were scholarships offered for me to study in Palestine, and even abroad. These scholarships would only be given to me, though, if I changed my major to medicine or engineering. Although these two majors are very common where I come from, I find no joy or interest in doing either one. Knowing how difficult it would be for my parents, and aware of the sacrifices I had to make, I told them that I still insisted on pursuing a degree in Journalism, because that is my passion.</p><p>Instead of settling for what was offered to me, I decided to move to Cyprus and attend EMU on a 50% scholarship and major in what I love. At the time of my acceptance I knew that my parents would not be able to afford it due to the large amount of debt my father was in. That is when it occurred to me to make this page and ask for financial support. Due to the overwhelming support I received, I was able to raise enough money to pay for my first semester and begin a new chapter in my life. I finished my first year with a 3.5 CGPA, learned Turkish, helped the Palestinian basketball team win 1st place in the national competition held at EMU, and learned so many valuable life-lessons. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454842509/ultf3sxaemhkndoudo1g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Unfortunately, though, today I am faced with that same obstacle I had last year. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">As
you are aware, Palestinians have to go through numerous hurdles in
order to ensure a good life and proper education for their children,
due to the conflict and constant pressure from the Israeli
government. My father in Palestine was recently forced to pay $6,000
to the Israeli government to keep them from demolishing our home in
Jerusalem. Furthermore, he is constantly paying lawyer fees and large
amounts of money to the government in order to postpone the court
date in which they decide whether to demolish our house or not. He was saving that money to pay for my tuition and housing in Cyprus. In addition, I have three brothers that are currently in
middle school and my parents are going through many issues to ensure
that they receive the best education possible. I have tried my best to
pay for my own education by getting multiple jobs in the summer.
Specifically, I worked as a waiter in two hotels, I did
house-keeping, tutoring, and I helped coach a basketball team.
Unfortunately, though, that was barely enough for me to pay part of my tuition fees.</span><p> In our society, it is difficult for us to put ourselves out there and to ask for help in times of distress. But if I wasn't certain that I had a purpose, and that I could make a change one day in the future, I would have taken those scholarships and studied something different. I wish that life was easy, and that I could be able to go to college without having financial worries, but I was born into a background with very limited resources. I will not let these obstacles prevent me from doing what I love and pursuing my lifelong dreams, though, and I hope that you can all see my vision. I plan to use my degree and experience in journalism to share the stories of the people who have no voice in today's world, beginning with the Palestinians living under occupation. Hopefully, my goals will bring attention to conflicts around the world and help end them.</p><p>With the 50% scholarship given to me, I have to pay approximately $2,100 a semester to attend EMU. The amount I'm attempting to raise isn't the amount needed to attend 4 years, it will only cover the next two semesters while my parents have some time to pay off the debt they're in. Any type of support is appreciated, even the smallest amount of money can make the biggest difference. Due to the current conditions, I only have two weeks to raise my funds and pay for my third semester at EMU, so please share this with anyone that you think might be able to help as soon as possible. I would like to thank those of you who are supporting my journey for the second time, it means the world to me, and nothing will go in vain I promise. If you wish to contact me regarding any questions you might have, my email is qaraeenyousef@gmail.com. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully I will be able to receive the education I dream of.</p><p></p></div>","Hello everyone,

<br/><p>We started early 2011 with buying schooluniforms for a few children in our neighborhood...now every year we raise funds so more children can to go to school.  Because you need a Schooluniform to be accepted to any school, even the free ones. A lot of Parents dont have money for these uniforms and for the first costs (books,school belongings)</p>

Maar we mogen niet officieel gaan starten, daarvoor is een aanbetaling van 75% nodig... Deze eerste fase bewerkstelligen is heel belangrijk, omdat na een eerste aanbetaling in Indonesië veel mogelijkheden open gaan.  Gemeentelijke Instellingen, de meer bedeelde inwoners en hooggeplaatste functionarissen zijn dan meer geneigd om je Goede Doel te steunen.    Als we te kennen geven dat ons Project gesponsord wordt door Nederlanders - dan komt er nog meer Goodwill..Foto : een gedeelte van het stuk grond waar met Jullie hulp een Leer-Centrum komt...Fase 2: De tweede aanbetaling voldoen  ( 3600 euro ). Met dit bedrag krijgen we toestemming ​​om te gaan bouwen.  Als dit bedrag via crowdfunding volbracht is dan zullen we met eigen geld + met donaties van welgestelde burgers van Sukabumi het volgende gaan bouwen :- 6 scholen units (elk voor 2 klaslokalen)- 6 aparte toiletten en sanitair / riolering- Groente & fruit plantageInclusief betaling voor de arbeiders.Fase 3:   De Laatste betaling voor het stuk Grond ( 2000 euro )    de definitieve officiële papieren zal worden ondertekend.Fase 4:   de Finale..de laatste  € 2.000.Voor dit bedrag zullen we bouwen:- 2 guesthouses (voor verhuur)- 2 toiletten- meubilairInclusief betaling voor de arbeiders.- Een clubhuis / samenlevingshuis voor sport, muziek, gesprek, theater en nog veel meer ..- Meubilair en apparatuur- leerboeken & lesmateriaal** Alle beginnende kosten (salaris) voor toekomstige leraren zal worden betaald uit eigen kapitaal en uit de verhuur van de 2 guesthouses en de winst van de gewassen en fruit + onze waardevolle vaste maandelijkse Nederlandse donateurs. ** De leerlingen produceren op de school bezems die verkocht worden.** Privé-lessen worden gegeven aan Volwassenen en kinderen. Deze lessen zijn voor de meer welgestelde mensen uit de omgeving. Zij betalen voor deze lessen.** We vragen ook periodieke donaties aan de meer welgestelde inwoners van de Stad .bedankt voor de aandacht.voor meer informatie over de reeds bestaande projecten en geschiedenis :http://ronrozario.com/DE%20PROJECTEN/index.html   bedankt alvast voor de aandacht.Ron & KarineVoor ons is het 'makkelijk' te spiegelen met de armoede om ons heen : alhoewel we heel basic leven, voelen we ons zeer gezegend...onze eigen 3 kinderen kunnen gewoon naar school waar ze volledige daglessen krijgen met computers, goede leerkrachten en faciliteiten..schoon,veilig en kwaliteit. Om ons heen zien we andere kinderen die niet naar school gaan of alleen maar 3 uurtjes per dag basislessen krijgen van vrijwilligers of van een laag betaald leerkracht....Wij leven in een stenen huis en hoger gelegen, maar beneden de vallei wonen gezinnen in houten hutten die overstroomd worden als het flink regent....Kinderen spelen in de goot of op vuilnisplekken of op begraafplaatsen in plaats van naar school te gaan.Gelukkig zijn er steeds meer fortuinlijke plaatselijke bewoners van bewust dat er hulp nodig is voor deze situatie. Onze Projecten krijgen stapsgewijs ook lokale aandacht. Die LEER-CENTRUM komt echt van de grond !Maar we kunnen het niet vervolmaken naar onze ideeën zonder de hulp van onze Vrienden en kennissen.....We gaan echt de goede kant op !volg ons en lees de updates via : https://www.facebook.com/groups/project.sukabumi/---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                     
                              4  PHASES  TO  ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL :
We started early 2011 with buying schooluniforms for a few children in our neighborhood...now every year we raise funds so more children can to go to school.  Because you need a Schooluniform to be accepted to any school, even the free ones. A lot of Parents dont have money for these uniforms and for the first costs (books,school belongings)
These children from poor family can only have basic education and go to school untill 11 or 12 in the morning.  The rest of the day they wonder around or have to work .  We like to build an original centre where we can educate these children after school...with lessons in basic computer skills, English conversation, in music and Art.  We also want to create a special massage-unit where the blind children can earn a living after they get their diploma.  Please help us and the children of Java to establish these projects...
Phase 1 :
To establish 2400 euro for the first downpayment of the property.  With this downpayment we can start to work on the land and start building.  But we cannot open a school or start a bussiness .  Only with a payment of 75 % we can start properly.

Phase 2 :  To get the 75% payment.
So the next fase is to establish another 3600 euro
With this amount we are actually alowed to start building.
   With our own capital & donations from the more wealthy people of the town, we are going to build :
- 5 schoolunits ( each for 2 classrooms )
- 6 seperate toilets & plumbing
- fruit & vegetables plantation
included payment for the workers.

Phase 3 :  the last 2000 euro for final purchase of the land.
the final papers will be signed.

Phase 4 :  the Final 2000 euro.
For this amount we will build :

- 2 guesthouses ( for rental )
- 2 toilets 
- furniture
included payment for the workers.

- A Clubhouse / society house for sports , music , conversation, theater and more..
- furniture & equipments
- costs for schoolbooks & schoolmaterial
      How we are going to Pay for future expenses ?
** All the costs (salary)  for future teachers will be payed from our own capital and from the rental of the 2 guesthouses and the profits of the crops and fruit.
** We give Private lessons to Adults & children...these lessons will be payed for.

My Story:
Once upon a
time I found yoga.  When I found Yoga I found myself. 
 My name is Jewlz Marie. I am a professor at Santa Monica College in the Communication Studies Department and I also work as a Camp Counselor at Camp UBUNTU for the Harold Robinson Foundation.  For those of you who aren't familiar, The Harold Robinson Foundation is an amazing organization that offers enriching camp retreats to inner city schools (students/staff/parents) all year long. I dedicate the majority of my time to working with students  and  inner city youth, teaching empathy, life skills, and communication; however, I want to be able to offer these communities more.   I strongly believe that yoga can have tremendous positive impact on ones overall quality of life and wellbeing. 
This January I will be embarking on an intense month long journey to
obtain my 200 hour yoga teaching certification with the International
Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre . This campaign is
important because it will allow me to obtain the certification I need to start providing inner city youth and parents with workshops that include, but are
not limited to, yoga, meditation, empathy, communication, and
self empowerment.

profit with an attitude! Our goal is to eliminate ""all"" geographic & economic boundaries in Education with Video Conferencing
95% of our classrooms may not experience Video Communications in their classrooms!
There are
students in our rural communities and inner city schools that have never been
outside the neighborhoods or the towns they live in. They are literally living
in an academic and cultural vacuum. Video Communications is absolutely the fastest way
to effect change on a massive scale!We believe that every student across America should
have the same access to video based learning in the classroom. There are many obvious benefits to Video Conferencing in the classroom - here are the Top 20 uses we have identified:

click here: ""Top 20"" Uses for Video in the Classroom
We know this sounds like a tall
order - but it can be done - so we will explain how Conferencing Places is making this happen –
how you can help - and why this will work! ConferencingPlaces.org combines three very powerful components in one highly scalable Educational Portal:
 Places - find over 150,000 Schools, Libraries & Museums across America. 

 Faculty-Hub - Teachers find each other -share common interests.


Resources-Hub - Schools can get technical help, find Tutors & Video Conferencing resources. 



What we will need to grow




It’s going to cost $50,000 dollars to do this and every
dollar we raise will help and will only be used to help America's classrooms. How we plan to use your $ donations:


Ongoing Web Portal development - funding for the cost of additional developers - in house or outsourced. Add more search functionality, add more content, add more Places for Educators to connect to, and add more advanced Portal features.


Add Resources - fund the cost of developing Resources-Hub with Best Practice guidelines for Faculty members and create a ""Painting by Numbers"" approach to Video Conferencing.

Promote Places, Facuty-Hub, & Resources-Hub to the Educational Community, Recruit more Tutors, Publishers, Content providers, Integrators, Technology Vendors, Consultants, and training services. Schedule Video based events and create mass adoption across all 3 components of this Portal.

Add Support-Blocks so we can build and deliver Web based and live support to the Schools and classrooms that need help!

Reward schools that reach out and leverage the many advantages of using Video Conferencing in the classroom. We will also ""expose"" the schools that refuse to change because the community can help encourage and support the use of Video in the classrooms from the ground up! 


Teach our Schools how to conduct a Video call in the classroom with or without expensive legacy Video Conferencing equipment in place. We will Help schools that do not currently have Video Conferencing use free 
and low cost cloud services to connect to other classrooms throughout 
the country.


Connect the dots - expand our reach by helping more faculty members find other faculty members that share common interests.

Help me combine my passion and my dream to create a place where people can use and practice their English in Trostberg, Germany!



 I’m Vickie Beck and I am an American living in beautiful Bavaria
Germany.  


My passion is teaching
Germans, children and adults, the English language in a creative way which I
have been doing on a freelance basis for over 20 years at kindergartens, schools, businesses and
even at churches around my area. 
My dream, is to have a café.  
If you have ever taken a language course you know that large classrooms
or an English course once a week isn’t the ideal situation for becoming more
fluent in a language. 

I am often asked “Vickie,where can I practice my
English?”
Then the idea came to me of combining both my passion and my dream to
open 
 I am so excited!
So much so that I spent 2 weeks in England last year working in a small
café shop and visiting many others, getting lots of tips on the pro’s and con’s
of the Café business. 
I then proceeded to get some qualifications for opening a café in Trostberg,
Germany and soon I will be taking a barista course at a local coffee
roaster.

Whether you are a pupil, a student, in business, an English course
attendee or a native speaker away from home, Vickie’s chat & chill is
the place to go!
At Vickie’s chat & chill you can practice your English ordering an
excellent cup of coffee of your choice along with something from my American

As I was calculating the cost of opening a cafe I realized that I would need some financial help.

open a language café and give English a home in Trostberg, Germany. I have found the perfect place.
 I can't wait to start!

I will also keep you informed via photos on progress and opening day.
How do I know this will be a

Firstly, because I have an amazing support team. 2 of my daughters who have restaurant experience, one in hotel mangement, will be assisting me in the cafe. I have a group of women who I meet with twice a month who are my "" cheer leaders"" reagarding this project. I also have a business coach.
Secondly,after 20
years of teaching English I have met hundreds of families and business people

<div>There is very little support and education for children with these conditions in Nepal. Often the children are not accepted in school or society and are left all day, sometimes in a locked room, with no interaction with other children or adults.</div>
<div>I've worked with people with learning disabilities, in England, for the last 10 years and want to share my skills with the teachers and families here in Nepal, giving them hope for the future of their children.</div>
<div>At present, the school supports the children with learning disabilities alongside the typical pre-school children, great whilst the child is still young, but not an ideal situation as they get older (8-9 year old children alongside 2-3year olds). I want to support the principal in developing the school by creating a 'day care' provision for the older children with learning disabilities and teaching them life skills to enable them to hopefully become independent in the future.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>On a temporary basis, we will start daycare from the principal's own home (a rented building). To resource this, I've estimated we need £1,500. This will enable us to purchase the following:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Arts and craft materials; paper, pens, scissors, paint etc</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Individual personal hygiene products (to teach children independent self care)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Sensory items, bubbles, balloons, musical items</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Toys and games, puzzles, balls hula hoops etc</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Gardening items (to learn farming skills)</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Ride on trike, see-saw</span><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>In Nepal, people with disabilities struggle to be accepted in society and this results in their families being marginalised too. Firstly, there is little education about their child's needs but also they are often blamed for the child being the way they are; they are accused of having 'a bad spirit'.</div>
<div>Unlike western countries, there is no financial support/aid. Often children miss out on vital doctor's appointments, because the families can't afford the expense or indeed understand the importance of them.</div>
<div>My hope is to show these families and wider society that these children can achieve and contribute to society; that they have value.</div>
<div>Alongside the daycare, I hope to provide monthly parent support sessions. The purpose of these sessions would be two fold. To help break down the isolation parents feel, letting them know they are not alone, but also to act as teaching sessions, helping them understand more about their child's condition and providing emotional support in the challenging task of parenting a child that's not valued in their society.</div>
<div>Please visit <a href=""http://www.childrenpokhara.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.childrenpokhara.com</a> to find out more about what the school is already doing.</div>
<div>This is a small project, but for the children and families involved it will make an amazing difference to their lives and their enjoyment of life. It gives them a clear message that they matter, they have value, that they are worth caring about.</div>
<div>Those of you who know me are aware that I have grown up as part of a fostering family for 28 years, so have lived with children who've experienced labelling, rejection and loss. For 10 of those years, I've also worked with people with learning disabilities and my heart is to bring warmth, acceptance and love to those who are often overlooked or rejected by society. I've seen first hand how consistent care and encouragement can help someone move from a position of loneliness and despair to starting to believe in themselves, accepting that they too have the right to dreams and striving to reach them.      </div>
<div>That's what I long to bring to these children and their families - that belief that life really can be different and worth living.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As with all crowd funding sites, you have to trust that the money you give will be used in the way described, but as so many of you already know me from work, church, social activities etc, I hope you have the confidence that I will ensure the money is used with integrity and wisdom. </div>
<div>At present, the school has few resources and the day care will be starting from scratch, so it will be slow progress for a while, but follow the blog on the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Children's Paradise webpage you can see where your money is being spent and also follow the individual stories of the children.</span>
</div>
<div>We'll certainly face some challenges in establishing this project - not least from the families themselves, who may be understandably fearful of the emotional cost of bringing their children out in public and taking them to the school. Then there's the people who'll think that because I'm a white tourist that I'll have lots of money to spend and who'll hope to fleece me when I buy items for the children. </div>
<div>I'm on a learning curve too, being a young woman in a different culture working with the bare minimum of Nepali language skills and still learning what's acceptable here and what will alienate people. However, I'm also sensible enough not to try and do this on my own, so I'll take advice from people here and abroad that I know and trust, people with a good understanding of Nepal, its society, disability, social justice and implementing new start social care projects. I'll take time to reflect on what I see and hear and share it with those people and seek advice before makiing decisions.</div>
<div>Knwoing you're entrusting me with your money is an awesome responsibility and I want to make it work well in this situation, so I'll treat it with care and respect, recognising what it has cost you to earn it and understanding that you want to see it used effectively.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting my Indie Go Go page!  My name is Melissa Neubart, and I am running my first-ever half-marathon for After-School All-Stars. </p>
<p>My story starts one day last November when I was running along the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. I was two months into my new position with After-School All-Stars Newark and New York, and, as with any job, I had a lot on my plate: a fresh environment, new colleagues, and learning the ropes of a new organization. I was extremely excited for this new opportunity given to me, but I knew I was beginning a journey that was going to push my limits. On this particular fall day, I’d gotten home, put my running shoes on and hit the pavement. Within moments, my mind was clear, and the stressors that once seemed vast and overwhelming, seemed miniscule as I looked across the river to the NYC skyline… what was I stressed out about again?</p>
<p></p>
<p>During that run along the river in November, I decided that I was going to <a href=""http://www.muscleandfitnesshers.com/training/going-distance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">run a half-marathon</a>. Wait—I thought—what am I thinking—how am I going to run a half-marathon? It sounded good, but the longest distance I had ever run was 4 miles.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> I knew that if I really was going to stick with this ambitious goal for myself, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I was going to do it for After-School All-Stars (ASAS).

The Story
Thank you for visiting my Indie Go Go page!  My name is Melissa Neubart, and I am running my first-ever half-marathon for After-School All-Stars. 
My story starts one day last November when I was running along the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. I was two months into my new position with After-School All-Stars Newark and New York, and, as with any job, I had a lot on my plate: a fresh environment, new colleagues, and learning the ropes of a new organization. I was extremely excited for this new opportunity given to me, but I knew I was beginning a journey that was going to push my limits. On this particular fall day, I’d gotten home, put my running shoes on and hit the pavement. Within moments, my mind was clear, and the stressors that once seemed vast and overwhelming, seemed miniscule as I looked across the river to the NYC skyline… what was I stressed out about again?

During that run along the river in November, I decided that I was going to run a half-marathon. Wait—I thought—what am I thinking—how am I going to run a half-marathon? It sounded good, but the longest distance I had ever run was 4 miles. I knew that if I really was going to stick with this ambitious goal for myself, I was going to do it for After-School All-Stars (ASAS). What better way to motivate myself than to support the amazing organization I work for? 



After-School All-Stars

Many, if not all of you, know of our founder, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He founded ASAS over 20 years ago as Inner City Games Foundation, bringing sports to youth nationwide to build self-confidence and self-reliance. Inner City Games changed its name to reflect its development into a school-based, comprehensive national organization. Today, ASAS serves over 85,000 youth nationally every single day providing free, engaging, after-school programming around academics, health and fitness, and enrichment. We work in inner-city schools for amazing kids that need it most.


Without ASAS, students may not have a safe environment to go to once class ends or a parent waiting at home for them once they leave the school building. ASAS provides a fun, creative, engaging atmosphere that attributes to their success as a student and lifelong learner. In addition, every student gets one hour of physical activity a day.   What We Need & What You Get Because of our amazing supporters, each one of our students get to attend our programs at NO cost. My goal is to raise $30,000 by April 26, 2015, the date of my half-marathon.  100% of the funding will go DIRECTLY to support the 800 kids receiving life-changing programs in Newark and New York City.  
I am on a mission and a timeline to reach my goal! 
We have fun and exciting perks to thank you! Firstly, every donor will receive a hand-written thank you letter from an All-Star! We hope that in addition to our cause, our perks will get you excited to contribute! 
We have teamed up with sponsors to offer prizes, including a year long workout plan from Cody: By donating at any level, you will be entered into a raffle to be chosen as 1 of the 5 winners to win the workout plan.

<br/><p></p>
<p>Chiunque volesse partecipare al nostro
progetto e aiutarci in qualsiasi modo, sarebbe di grande aiuto. Il progetto è
molto vasto e richiede per ogni edizione un grande sforzo fisico, organizativo ed economico, per questo c'è bisogno di condivisione, sostegno morale, nuove relazioni umane.</p>
<p>Il primo passo verso la realizzazione di
questo progetto è stato organizzare nel 2007 la prima edizione del festival <br/></p>
<p>Ad oggi abbiamo realizzato 8 edizioni e
stiamo preparando la nona.</p>
<p>Finora non siamo riusciti ad avere
finanziamenti,  ma siamo fiduciosi
nelle nostre risorse, nell'aiuto di altri colleghi, nell'arrivo di
turisti/spettatori o sponsor. Crediamo che con la buona volontà si possa
riuscire ad ottenere qualcosa, anche se fossero solo valide relazioni umane: solo il piacere di realizzare qualcosa di bello ci spinge ogni anno a continuare a farlo.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1373753/files/20150411013007-DSC_6232.jpg?1428741007"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<br/><h3><br/></h3></div>","FORUNDIO  FESTIVAL 
(teatro, musica, arte varia e natura)30-31 luglio 1-2-agosto 2015
Buongiorno a tutti siamo Bianca e Cesare
della 'Compagnia Teatro Scalzo' di Genova.
 Il nostro progetto è quello di rendere il festival un appuntamento fisso, sede di eventi culturali e artistici, fruibile e
aperto a chiunque possa ""ritrovarsi"" in una località decisamente poco
turistica ma strettamente legata alla natura.

Chiunque volesse partecipare al nostro
progetto e aiutarci in qualsiasi modo, sarebbe di grande aiuto. Il progetto è
molto vasto e richiede per ogni edizione un grande sforzo fisico, organizativo ed economico, per questo c'è bisogno di condivisione, sostegno morale, nuove relazioni umane.
Il primo passo verso la realizzazione di
questo progetto è stato organizzare nel 2007 la prima edizione del festival 
Ad oggi abbiamo realizzato 8 edizioni e
stiamo preparando la nona.
Finora non siamo riusciti ad avere
finanziamenti,  ma siamo fiduciosi
nelle nostre risorse, nell'aiuto di altri colleghi, nell'arrivo di
turisti/spettatori o sponsor. Crediamo che con la buona volontà si possa
riuscire ad ottenere qualcosa, anche se fossero solo valide relazioni umane: solo il piacere di realizzare qualcosa di bello ci spinge ogni anno a continuare a farlo.
Faggio Rotondo si trova nell'entroterra
ligure (Genova), immerso nella natura, con la vista del mare all'orrizzonte.
E' necessario percorrere un tratto
pedonale (20 minuti circa a seconda di dove si parcheggia), ma per anziani,
donne incinte o con bambini molto piccoli o portatori di handikap, siamo
disponibili ad accompagnarvi alla meta con un nostro mezzo.
GIORNATA TIPO:
ore 8 escursione (mattinata)ore 9/10 laboratorio yoga

COSTI
Il Festival è completamente gratuito, ad
eccezione dei pasti (la cucina è vegetariana (e su richiesta anche vegana) comunque a prezzi
contenutiOBIETTIVICi siamo posti un traguardo, cioè di raggiungere la cifra di 7500 euro.questo è quello che servirebbe per:a livello logistico: miglioramento zona campeggio, potenziamento punti acqua e relative cisterne, segnalazione percorsi, illuminazione, panche e tavole zona pasti, miglioramento impianto elettrico, miglioramento raccolta differenziata (acquisto contenitori), potenziamento cucina (acquisto frigo), rifacimento palco con tettoia, rifacimento zona bar, miglioramento strada, pannelli solari per acqua calda, pulizia dei sentieri di accesso, segnaletica per raggiungere il festival, ...a livello artistico: budget per i vari gruppi musicali, teatrali, circensi, performer vari, pubblicità, potenziamento service audio luci, acquisto luci led a basso consumo.Al di là di come andrà questa raccolta fondi, sappiamo che in ogni caso il ""9° Forundio Festival"" ci sarà come ogni anno. con il vostro aiuto speriamo di poter fare tutti quei miglioramenti che altrimenti sarebbero impensabili!!!oltre all'aspetto economico( ognuno può donare quello che ritiene giusto), ci farebbe piacere sentire di non essere soli in questa avventura. ogni anno il festival è stato fatto grazie all'energia di un gruppo di amici, che si sono operati i giorni del festival e quelli prima destinati alla preparazione, con la unica meta di arrivare a realizzare questo evento. non c'è per nessuno un ritorno economico e crediamo che sia un valore fondamentale.in ogni caso oltre alle vostre donazioni, potete aiutarci anche solo condividendo il progetto sui vari social network e soprattutto partecipando al festival!graziea tuttiil Team del Forundio FestivalBianca, Cesare, Corrado, Cristina, Giulia, Lino, Rosanna, Enzo, Damiano, Cinzia, Mabel, Mauizio, Federico, Silvana

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>THE STORY</b></p>
<p>I happened to visit Ladakh for the first time in the Autumn of 2005 and it created a lasting impression. Ladakh, the high mountain plateau surrounding the upper Indus valley, stands at a geographical and cultural crossroads between Tibet, Central Asia, Persia and India. Long closed off due to its disputed borders with China and Pakistan, the region has become a popular tourist destination, and is rapidly becoming more integrated with the rest of India. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After initial visits to the region, I realised that beyond this breathtaking mountainous terrain that holds great appeal for tourists, there was another world where the children were very eager to learn and support was required to hone their talents. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""middle"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432617841/lvubjemckaeo37ttfoka.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My skills lie in designing educational modules that evoke imagination, enhance creativity and set young learners out on the path of inquiry-based learning. In 2011,  I stayed for 3 months, and taught at two monastery schools and visited remote schools where children facing adversity were provided some means to education. Having previously taught and trained with primary school children, I recognised the deficiencies quickly. In their cherubic smiles and sharp minds, I saw ample potential. <b>And that is when Avalokitesvara Trust was born... </b><br/></p>

<p><b>PROJECTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR..</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>FoL began with engagement in one or two local monastery schools, with the intention to create tools and skills to make learning and compassion thrive in the classroom. FoL joined hands with other isolated and neglected schools across Ladakh, towards both the Indo-China and Indo-Pakistan borders.</p>
<p>In the expanded project area, we have accomplished the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Sourcing and collection of children's books and setting up reading rooms </b>The books are carefully selected by the team according to suitability for Ladakhi children. These include 3 levels of reading based on age-group and ability. So far from our base in Leh, we have set up 40 reading rooms and book corners in schools and learning centres, stocking them with a range of materials, mostly childrens' books, in all the languages taught here - Hindi, Urdu, English and Ladakhi/Tibetan. Some books are also bilingual (English-Hindi). The reading rooms are set up in existing schools, repainted and refurbished with furniture designed by us in traditional style primarily reading desks and shelves.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Implementing health and hygiene modules </b>Children here are prone to respiratory, skin and bone problems due to the dry cold climate in Ladakh. There is a lack of hygiene awareness and facilities. We conduct fun and friendly modules for children which educate them in basic hygiene and its importance. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Pedagogical material, educational games and sports equipment</b>These include mathematical kits for pre-primary and primary schools that introduce number operations and logical abilities to the students, flash cards and language aids to assist effective learning in our reading programmes. Our volunteers have conducted football, yoga and physical awareness modules and also distributed equipment for sports and outdoor games.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Empowering Ladakhi teachers with educational resources, teaching aids and training programs </b>One of our long term goals is to introduce and empower local teachers with ideas, methods and resources to encourage creative and experience-based learning, expanding the focus beyond curricular rote-learning. This is done through both organised workshops and the gradual building of a personal network of trained volunteers and interested teachers.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Translating and publishing childrens' books</b> We are interested in publishing translations of select childrens’ books in local languages. Our first is a Ladakhi translation of ‘Chuskit goes to School’, in collaboration with Pratham Books. </li></ul>
<ul><li><p><b>Volunteer Programme</b> We orient and train volunteers with a structured pedagogy. They are appointed to teach children and train teachers at schools with these approaches to learning in the area of language, arts and maths.

</div></div>","Jhulley! (Greetings in Ladakhi) 
I am a designer and educator dedicated to child-friendly learning.  My work is primarily inspired by the sublime values of limitless compassion, mindfulness and human connection. 






THE STORY
I happened to visit Ladakh for the first time in the Autumn of 2005 and it created a lasting impression. Ladakh, the high mountain plateau surrounding the upper Indus valley, stands at a geographical and cultural crossroads between Tibet, Central Asia, Persia and India. Long closed off due to its disputed borders with China and Pakistan, the region has become a popular tourist destination, and is rapidly becoming more integrated with the rest of India. 


After initial visits to the region, I realised that beyond this breathtaking mountainous terrain that holds great appeal for tourists, there was another world where the children were very eager to learn and support was required to hone their talents. 


My skills lie in designing educational modules that evoke imagination, enhance creativity and set young learners out on the path of inquiry-based learning. In 2011,  I stayed for 3 months, and taught at two monastery schools and visited remote schools where children facing adversity were provided some means to education. Having previously taught and trained with primary school children, I recognised the deficiencies quickly. In their cherubic smiles and sharp minds, I saw ample potential. And that is when Avalokitesvara Trust was born... 

                  
One of the keys projects currently run under the umbrella of the Avalokiteśvara Trust is FOUNTAIN OF LEARNING. Fountain of Learning a.k.a FOL, is an initiative to nurture and educate children in isolated villages of Ladakh. In the last 4 years, FOL has created reading rooms and libraries in Ladakh, a remote ice desert region of the western Himalaya.
PROJECTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR..

FoL began with engagement in one or two local monastery schools, with the intention to create tools and skills to make learning and compassion thrive in the classroom. FoL joined hands with other isolated and neglected schools across Ladakh, towards both the Indo-China and Indo-Pakistan borders.
In the expanded project area, we have accomplished the following:


Sourcing and collection of children's books and setting up reading rooms The books are carefully selected by the team according to suitability for Ladakhi children. These include 3 levels of reading based on age-group and ability. So far from our base in Leh, we have set up 40 reading rooms and book corners in schools and learning centres, stocking them with a range of materials, mostly childrens' books, in all the languages taught here - Hindi, Urdu, English and Ladakhi/Tibetan. Some books are also bilingual (English-Hindi). The reading rooms are set up in existing schools, repainted and refurbished with furniture designed by us in traditional style primarily reading desks and shelves.

Implementing health and hygiene modules Children here are prone to respiratory, skin and bone problems due to the dry cold climate in Ladakh. There is a lack of hygiene awareness and facilities. We conduct fun and friendly modules for children which educate them in basic hygiene and its importance. 

Pedagogical material, educational games and sports equipmentThese include mathematical kits for pre-primary and primary schools that introduce number operations and logical abilities to the students, flash cards and language aids to assist effective learning in our reading programmes. Our volunteers have conducted football, yoga and physical awareness modules and also distributed equipment for sports and outdoor games.

Empowering Ladakhi teachers with educational resources, teaching aids and training programs One of our long term goals is to introduce and empower local teachers with ideas, methods and resources to encourage creative and experience-based learning, expanding the focus beyond curricular rote-learning. This is done through both organised workshops and the gradual building of a personal network of trained volunteers and interested teachers.

Translating and publishing childrens' books We are interested in publishing translations of select childrens’ books in local languages. Our first is a Ladakhi translation of ‘Chuskit goes to School’, in collaboration with Pratham Books. 
Volunteer Programme We orient and train volunteers with a structured pedagogy. They are appointed to teach children and train teachers at schools with these approaches to learning in the area of language, arts and maths. You can read the experiences shared by the volunteers here







                                



                      



FoL is a slow labour of dedication and love that has brought me deeper insights into their lives and while ‘educating,’ I have learnt and unlearnt a lot from them. Filling a classroom with love and connection, safety and trust, enthusiasm and the joy for learning encourages children to tap into their true creative potential. If we are to ignite young minds and a play a role in moulding them into self-confident, mindful and sensitive beings, let us do this gradually, with gentle encouragement and with the freedom to enjoy their childhoods. Each and every child, irrespective of his or her family or financial background, deserves a chance to go to school, to read and write, to explore, to discover and to learn, play and grow; while truly enjoying the process of learning! And it is said that where compassion thrives, so does learning!

one of the few educational institutions in Poland that supports and encourages
homeschoolers through various activities and events. In this year’s
national  curriculum test for

     are committed to providing our children the opportunity to learn close to
     their home. In 2011, when the local authorities closed the public school
     in our area, we opened a non-public school in the same building. Now the
     local government wants to use this building for a different purpose.
The only way to save our school
     is to buy the school building from the local government 
Our school is not only a center
     of learning, but also a meeting place where the local community can
     experience culture and socialize.

   What We Need 


We are raising money to buy the school building and to renovate it.
     We need $ 60 000 
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will put the money in a bank
     account and continue to seek funds from other sources until we collect
     enough money to buy the school building.
    The Impact 
Our
teachers are young, dedicated and passionate educators who use creative and
innovative teaching methods.  We have a
school garden where children grow seeds and we also teach sign language. Our
students feel safe and happy in our non-public primary school in Ręków. We are
one of the few educational institutions in Poland that supports and encourages
homeschoolers through various activities and events. In this year’s
national  curriculum test for
sixth-graders our students scored 7 out of 9 in core subjects, which ranks us well above
the nationwide average, and 9 out of 9 in English language, which ranks us as among
the top primary schools in our country in this subject.   
    Other Ways You Can Help 
If you can’t afford to support us
financially we would be very grateful if you could help us by spreading the
word about this campaign among your friends. ""The Active"" website (sorry, only in Polish): http://www.stowarzyszenie-aktywni.pl/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The historic buildings at the Arizona State Fairgrounds need

properly, complete sets of measured drawings are needed, as the originals have
been lost. Some of the buildings were constructed under the Works Progress
Administration (WPA) of the New Deal program.</p>
<p>Local materials were combined with cutting edge technology.

<p>Measured drawings were traditionally created by hand using
lots of ladders. They followed standards set by the Historic American Building
Survey, another New Deal program. Today, such an undertaking on these buildings
would take months. Using modern technology of lasers, we will be laser scanning
the buildings in under one week. Drones will be used to capture the details out
of sight. For example, the roof of the Grandstand has an arrow painted on it.
That arrow originally was used to help point pilots in the direction of the
Phoenix airport. We want to capture and preserve this aspect of our Region’s
history.</p>

</div></div>","Namaste!We need your help to finance the training and full-time salary of a new Entrepreneurship Development Facilitator for Nepal.Your contribution will help us give free, real-time, international-standard assistance to hundreds of budding entrepreneurs in one of the poorest countries in the world.                              Have you ever had an idea that you KNEW would make a great
business?  What if you really wanted to

Many of them are too poor to pursue their ideas, and their dreams for a

Now, people in  Nepal will get a real chance at seeing

Entrepreneurship Development Facilitation helps individuals understand and

considered starting a business and is in need of information.  They walk

themselves visible to those who want to better themselves through
entrepreneurship. 
Entrepreneurship Development Facilitators are trained to listen to entrepreneurs
self-evaluate their own business ideas and to determine the passions they have for their own personal business growth.  The Entrepreneurship Development Facilitator then
searches a wide base of local network participants for individuals that can team with and help the entrepreneur realize those passions. Entrepreneurship Development Facilitation builds teams. The critical component is that this service is FREE to
the entrepreneur and available for as long as a community chooses to keep an
Entrepreneurship Development Facilitator in their midst. The Himalayan Aid model guarantees free and equal access
for all.
HOW WE'LL SPEND YOUR CONTRIBUTION:Himalayan Aid, a U.S. Non-profit 501(c)(3) organization and a Nepal-registered NGO will distribute the funding from this campaign. Your  U.S. TAX DEDUCTIBLE contributions will go directly to train and pay the full-time salaries of one  Entrepreneurship Development Facilitator for a period of two years.

for very little at the point of impact and, often, our perception of what is
best for those in need is often quite different from the needs they express to
us in person. Entrepreneurship  Development Facilitation embodies this philosophy. 
This program will send a message that locally-originated
ideas need only our partnership and not our dominance in order to succeed.

<div>That said, we will begin our business by offering two subscriptions - one for ages 12-18 and one for ages 18+. </div>
<div>Each month, the subscriber will receive a new box inspired by a muse. For example,""The Calliope Box"" will have everything you need to inspire you to write poetry and ""The Polymnia Box"" will have everything you need to create your own musical instruments. Each subscription will also have a code to register for an online class that is aligned with the theme of your monthly subscription.</div>

                              group of parents and teachers came together and 
                              
                              created something wonderful in the summer of 2006.<blockquote>

                              losing the school they loved, and being told 
                              
                              “No” every time they had an idea to try and save 
                              
                              it, they decided to start their own independent 
                              
                              school. The odds were definitely against them. 
                              
                              It was nearly June when they decided to go for 
                              
                              it. Ideally, you would want a year to plan 
                              
                              something like this; to develop a business plan, 
                              
                              to study other independent schools, to put 
                              
                              together a staff, to recruit students, to find a 
                              
                              location and fill it with the materials needed, 
                              
                              etc….</p>
<p>They realized though,  
                              
                              they could not wait. Students from four area 
                              
                              schools were being forced to find new homes in 
                              
                              September – and once they had adjusted to these 
                              
                              new schools they were not likely to do it all 
                              
                              over again the following year. So this group, 
                              
                              armed with little experience but boundless 
                              
                              passion, had to create an entirely new school in

                              losing the school they loved, and being told 
                              
                              “No” every time they had an idea to try and save 
                              
                              it, they decided to start their own independent 
                              
                              school. The odds were definitely against them. 
                              
                              It was nearly June when they decided to go for 
                              
                              it. Ideally, you would want a year to plan 
                              
                              something like this; to develop a business plan, 
                              
                              to study other independent schools, to put 
                              
                              together a staff, to recruit students, to find a 
                              
                              location and fill it with the materials needed, 
                              
                              etc….
They realized though,  
                              
                              they could not wait. Students from four area 
                              
                              schools were being forced to find new homes in 
                              
                              September – and once they had adjusted to these 
                              
                              new schools they were not likely to do it all 
                              
                              over again the following year. So this group, 
                              
                              armed with little experience but boundless 
                              
                              passion, had to create an entirely new school in 
                              
                              less than 100 days. And they did it.  Fast forward to today.  Now stands All

Yellow Dog Village should be saved and preserved. This is an
important historical site, a miners village with 34 houses that hold within
them the histories of hundreds of families over the past 100 years. 
  What We Need & What You Get You can go back in time! When the repairs to the houses in the village have been done, you can come to stay at the village, and to study traditional crafts from the craftsmen who shall live here in the village. Come, live in the village, as they did a century ago. Try your hand using tools they used, see what it was like to live in a village a century ago. Unplug from the technology that seems to be controlling our lives, for a week, and go back to a time when a village was a true community.After almost a year of clean-up of cutting and grazing weeds
and grasses, cutting trees and shrubs back, and picking up trash, tires, etc,
the village looks like a village again. As an important historic site, Yellow Dog Village is the perfect setting to teach traditional rural crafts. To establish this educational program, we need your help to fund the necessary repairs to preserve these houses and buildings.

<i>Well, my Personal story could maybe help you to understand the reason of  my hot passion for self-knowledge and personal development:</i> During my childhood (and <span style=""background-color: initial;"">even after) I have been myself  in a very depressing family situation which was for me very hard to live...(and of course, a very low level of esteem of myself!...like many people today, unfortunately ). Consequently, for many years, I was searching for different solutions in order to get out of these difficulties. Finally, there is now exactly 1 year ago, I met online a hungarian coach of motivation and personal development who helped me to change completely my life (quickly, in only 21 days!),  in a positive direction and build for me a positive and strong personality, that I have today.    </span>

<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>Eh bien, mon histoire personnelle pourrait peut-être vous aider à comprendre la raison de ma passion chaude pour la conscience de soi et le développement personnel: </i> Lors de mon enfance (et même après), je vivais une vie et  une situation familiale très déprimante, très angoissante, très dure  pour moi.. (et bien sûr, un très faible niveau d'estime de moi-même!.. comme beaucoup de personnes aujourd'hui, malheureusement). Par conséquent, pendant de nombreuses années, je cherchais des solutions différentes afin de pouvoir sortir de ces difficultés. Finalement, cela fait exactement 1 an que j'ai découvert par internet les enseignements d'une grande coach hongroise de motivation et de développement personnel et elle m'a personnellement aidé à changer ma vie (rapidement, en seulement 21 jours!), dans une direction positive et me bâtir une personnalité forte et positive que j'ai enfin aujourd'hui.<table><tbody><tr>

<li>In  my home country, as everywhere in the world, people need help and guidance to find a way and get out of the negative ""flow"" of their life, to get out of their depression, their stress, panic, sadness, sorrow, anxiety and aimlessness.

Bonjour! Permettez-moi de me présenter: je m'appelle Judith Verdon, je suis d'origine hongroise (d'Europe centrale), vivant actuellement en France depuis quelques années, avec ma famille. (C'est donc par ce fait que j'utilise également la langue française  dans la description de mon projet).           J'ai grandi dans l'un des plus beaux pays du monde (pour moi), un petit pays, avec des gens chaleureux et accueillants: en Hongrie.




                                     





At the moment, I am learning (by online courses) about self-awareness and personal development, I am ""student"" and my studies will finish at the end of March  2016.  My main goal is to become a coach of self-knowledge and personal development, in order to help many people in Hungary (and hungarian speaking people everywhere in the world) ... people who need to change their life in  a positive direction, by setting  reasonable life goals and also to reach them.    

Je suis en train de suivre des cours de formation de conscience de soi et de développement personnel. Mes études se termineront en fin de Mars 2016. Mon objectif principal est de devenir coach de connaissance de soi et  développement personnel, afin de pouvoir aider de nombreuses personnes en Hongrie (et ceux qui parlent hongrois partout dans le monde) ... les gens qui ont besoin de changer leur vie dans une direction positive, en se fixant des objectifs de vie raisonnables et aussi les atteindre, bien sûr.




           
    What is Self-Awareness? /  Qu'est-ce que la               conscience de soi?

       Self-awareness is a psychological state in which people are aware of their          traits, feelings and behaviour. Alternately, it can be defined as the                          realization of oneself as an individual entity.""(Crisp & Turner, 2010) 




Why do I want to become a coach of self-awareness?..// Pourquoi voudrais-je devenir un coach de conscience de soi? 




Well, my Personal story could maybe help you to understand the reason of  my hot passion for self-knowledge and personal development: During my childhood (and even after) I have been myself  in a very depressing family situation which was for me very hard to live...(and of course, a very low level of esteem of myself!...like many people today, unfortunately ). Consequently, for many years, I was searching for different solutions in order to get out of these difficulties. Finally, there is now exactly 1 year ago, I met online a hungarian coach of motivation and personal development who helped me to change completely my life (quickly, in only 21 days!),  in a positive direction and build for me a positive and strong personality, that I have today.    


Eh bien, mon histoire personnelle pourrait peut-être vous aider à comprendre la raison de ma passion chaude pour la conscience de soi et le développement personnel:  Lors de mon enfance (et même après), je vivais une vie et  une situation familiale très déprimante, très angoissante, très dure  pour moi.. (et bien sûr, un très faible niveau d'estime de moi-même!.. comme beaucoup de personnes aujourd'hui, malheureusement). Par conséquent, pendant de nombreuses années, je cherchais des solutions différentes afin de pouvoir sortir de ces difficultés. Finalement, cela fait exactement 1 an que j'ai découvert par internet les enseignements d'une grande coach hongroise de motivation et de développement personnel et elle m'a personnellement aidé à changer ma vie (rapidement, en seulement 21 jours!), dans une direction positive et me bâtir une personnalité forte et positive que j'ai enfin aujourd'hui.


Therefore,  I decided to help  people to never be so deeply  depressed, desperate and sad as I was before...I started to work hard on myself and today, I am finally happy, I'm smiling to people, I have big goals (for example : this project) and I feel better and better, every single day !         
Par conséquent, j'ai décidé d'aider les gens pour qu'ils ne soient jamais si  profondément déprimée, triste et désespérée que moi, je l'étais à l'époque ... J'ai donc commencé à travailler très dur sur moi-même, sur ma personnalité et aujourd'hui je me trouve enfin heureuse, souriante envers les gens, j'ai de grand objectifs (par exemple: ce projet) et je me sens de mieux en mieux dans ma peau, chaque jour!






                        




     The Impact /L'impact

In  my home country, as everywhere in the world, people need help and guidance to find a way and get out of the negative ""flow"" of their life, to get out of their depression, their stress, panic, sadness, sorrow, anxiety and aimlessness. Self-awareness and self-knowledge are excellent  keys to help every person to find positive goals and  to build a strong, positive and ""healthy"" character. 
Dans mon pays d'origine, comme partout dans le monde, les gens ont besoin d'aide et des conseils pour trouver un chemin pour sortir d'un «flux» négative de leur vie,  sortir de leur dépression, leur stress, leur panique, leur tristesse, leur chagrin, leur anxiété et désoeuvrement. La conscience de soi et la motivation personnelle sont d' excellents clés pour aider des personnes à se trouver des buts positifs et de se construire une personnalité forte, positive et ""saine"".                        



                          
                                     ""Watch your thoughts, they become words.
                                      Watch your words, they become actions.
                                      Watch your actions, they become habits.
                                      Watch your habits, they become your character.
                                      Watch your character, it becomes your destiny.""
                                      (Frank Outlaw)  



The online courses , followed by a 21 day-program : the methods I am  learning now and  I'll  teach later, (using internet tools: web conference room, skype, ..)  are mainly inspired by the following bibliographies (some of them): 

Les cours en ligne, suivis d'un programme de 21 jours : les méthodes que je suis en train d'apprendre et que j'enseignerai plus tard (en utilisant des outils Internet: salle de conférence web, Skype, etc..) , sont principalement inspirés par les bibliographies suivantes (en voici quelques une):



dr. Joseph Murphy's spiritual books: The Power of your Subconscious Mind, Selvarajan Yesudian: Yoga and Health (hatha yoga), Gertrud Hirschi: Mudras: Yoga in Your Hands, Noah St. John: The Affirmations System, Dale Carnegie's success books, Carl Gustav Jung's, Eckhart Tolle's works and teachings...  (and many more)



       



     Challenge / Le défi

It's been a long time,  I am interested in psychology, personal development and self-knowledge...  Recently, I decided to be ""useful"" and help  others to be able to change their life by thinking in another way.   

Cela fait  longtemps que je m'intéresse à la psychologie, au développement personnel et à la connaissance de soi ... Récemment, j'ai décidé d'être «utile» et d'aider les autres à pouvoir changer leur vie, en pensant d'une manière différente.

<p></p>
<p>If I close my eyes and squeeze them tight, I can see Juanita as I met her when I first arrived in Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala in 2004. I was a Peace Corps volunteer, working as an environmental education teacher in rural schools and Juanita was a 5th grader in my class. She was one of two female students amongst a sea of male classmates, and while she was the smallest student in her group, she made the most memorable impression on me. Juanita shimmered with confidence, kindness and diplomacy.</p> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After she graduated from elementary school, my life continued to intertwine with Juanita’s. In fact, she “grew up” with La Puerta Abierta. We opened our library and learning center in 2006 just as she graduated from elementary school. She was eager to participate in her community and was hungry to read and learn more about the world beyond the boundaries of Santiago Atitlan. She was one of our first local volunteers at our center and would dedicate a few hours every week to organizing books in our library collection, preparing materials for our story hours and designing our bulletin boards.</span><p></p>
<p>As the years passed, Juanita became increasingly busy with high-school projects, extra curricular activities and family commitments (Juanita is the oldest of 4 sisters.) Even when her days felt full, Juanita would find small windows of time to collaborate at La Puerta Abierta.</p>
<p>Five years ago La Puerta Abierta expanded to incorporate early childhood education classes into our program. The development of our preschool coincided with Juanita’s graduation from teaching school in Santiago Atitlan. As we interviewed Juanita for a position as a teacher at our center, she shined with the same confidence, intelligence and creativity that I detected in her years prior. After “growing up” in our center, she was an ideal match for our school.</p>
<p>Juanita has dedicated the past five years to working with children at La Puerta Abierta. She’s had experience teaching preschool, kindergarten, first grade, early stimulation, and managing our traveling library.</p>
<p>Today, Juanita is the Co-Director at La Puerta Abierta and helps to ensure that our programs are strong, stable and smooth. She greets parents in the the morning with warm smiles, helps our staff develop curriculum, organizes field trips, evaluates students, and welcomes volunteers to our center. In fact, I’m quite certain that we’ve come full circle and that I’ve nearly worked my way out of a job…a satisfying revelation for those of us in the field of development.</p>

<p>Juanita continues to dream big. In addition to working at La Puerta Abierta, she is studying psychology at the university and hopes to develop community programs that benefit children in the future.</p>

I have always wanted to learn more about my past, as I feel it is a very important part of one's growth and future life. <br/></p>
<p>I made the decision a couple of months ago after I graduated college. I still have memories from my past, especially those of the orphanage I was in. I will be traveling with a special program that will take care of all the details. I am also in the process of facilitating a birth family search. <br/></p>
<p>I will be traveling with my mother in the summer of 2016. This trip will help me learn about where I came from (birth place, and about my birth family) and perhaps why the circumstances led me to be put up for adoption. Although it is an emotional roller coaster, in the long run it will provide a real strong sense of re-connection. <br/></p> </div><div>
<p>The program will cost $8,000 USD total for my mother and I, including our air fair. The program then provides meals, total travel when in Russia, room and board, and a full time translator for 2 weeks. <br/></p>
<p>My intention throughout this journey is to give back to the world in a way that allows for other adoptees to go back to their birth places. I will provide free coaching to others going through the same things I did, and I will help them with the process if they feel they need support. <br/>I will also make a donation to orphanages (mine in Russia), as well as some here in the United States. <br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div></div><div>
<p>There may be many obstacles along the way such as financial and emotional, yet I have always been determined and compassionate throughout my life, and I always persevere. <br/></p>

As we all know, sometimes difficult news to bare needs to be protected at first before sharing with others for your own healing.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>As most of you know, I have been in the midst of working with someone who faciliated the search for my birth family. This process has not been easy, and has had many ups and downs. Yet, I find it appropriate now to share with everyone what I have learned and found out.</p>
<p>On November 7th the search officially started in Yekaterinburg Russia. I was nervous and excited all at the same time and for days waited for the searcher to tell me what he found. My understanding was that the search itself would only take a couple of days in Yekaterinburg. For about two weeks I wasn’t hearing anything. Finally, on a Saturday morning the email came.</p>
<p>The search revealed that two weeks before he arrived, my birth mother passed away (October 30th). When I was reading this, I didn’t feel a lot of emotion, but was more shocked and couldn’t believe this. How strange and auspicious that she died so soon before he arrived. Then he pursues to tell me that most of the people he talked to said she never had family visit her and she never spoke about her family. Therefore, there was nobody stepping up and claiming responsibility for the funeral arrangements or the body for that fact. He gave me a couple of options. One, I could not do anything and let the State take care of it and she would be buried in some area where other unknown people are and given a number. The other option, I could claim responsibility and arrange the burial/cremation and do what I wanted in terms of her funeral.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to process this, but I did decide I wanted to take responsibility. I felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do, as well as some kind of healing process for me to be able to say that I buried my birth mother. I was the one that took care of her in that way.</p>
<p>As of right now, we don’t know anything about a birth father, and or any other siblings (on record). Because my birth mother was so incredibly poor, the tracking of her life was not easy to attain and or much further information. The search revealed that I was most probably born in a small village on a farm about 100 miles outside of Yekaterinburg, called Zaykovo. From there, I traveled to another town called Irbit and stayed in an orphanage for some months. Then finally went to Yekaterinburg to the last orphanage. Yet, this story doesn’t seem quite right because when the searcher traveled to Yekaterinburg and found neighbors and friends who knew my birth mother, two nice women said they have actually met me. They were shown my picture, and they read a letter that I wrote to my birth family. One of the women knew my mother because she worked with her at a shoe factory, and the other woman was the owner of the apartment complex that my mother had a room in. Luckily, they are very nice and want to meet me when I come in the summer. In addition, Larisa was kind enough to to hold any valuable things and or pictures that my mother had, and she helped with much of the funeral logistics on that side with the searcher. Just a couple of days ago, my birth mother was finally cremated and the urn is being held for me until I get there.</p>
<p>Since I have learned more, it has been extremely emotionally difficult. Disappointment, anger, sadness, etc. You could never imagine and predict what you would feel. I certainly didn’t. And I certainly had no clue that this story would turn out like this. Yet, I believe everything happens for a reason, and I know this is how everything was meant to be. Now, more than ever I feel like this trip back is really about closure for myself, as well as for her. In addition, I am starting to feel that my fundraising is not just for me. I will give a percentage to the Gift of Identity Fund which is part of the program I am going with that awards grants to those going on the trip based on family income. I applied to this and did not receive the award, which made me realize that there are families in the exact same position as us. Wanting to do this search and trip, yet needing help for sure. Therefore, anything that I raise, some of that will go to the Gift of Identity, as well as another portion will be donated to the orphanage I was in and will be named after my birth mother (Olga Nikolayevna Safranova)."" </p>

<ul> </ul> </div><br/></div>","I was adopted from Yekaterinburg Russia in 1996, and came to the United States at the age of three and a half. I have always wanted to learn more about my past, as I feel it is a very important part of one's growth and future life. 
I made the decision a couple of months ago after I graduated college. I still have memories from my past, especially those of the orphanage I was in. I will be traveling with a special program that will take care of all the details. I am also in the process of facilitating a birth family search. 
I will be traveling with my mother in the summer of 2016. This trip will help me learn about where I came from (birth place, and about my birth family) and perhaps why the circumstances led me to be put up for adoption. Although it is an emotional roller coaster, in the long run it will provide a real strong sense of re-connection.  
The program will cost $8,000 USD total for my mother and I, including our air fair. The program then provides meals, total travel when in Russia, room and board, and a full time translator for 2 weeks. 
My intention throughout this journey is to give back to the world in a way that allows for other adoptees to go back to their birth places. I will provide free coaching to others going through the same things I did, and I will help them with the process if they feel they need support. I will also make a donation to orphanages (mine in Russia), as well as some here in the United States. 
   
There may be many obstacles along the way such as financial and emotional, yet I have always been determined and compassionate throughout my life, and I always persevere. 
Below, is my last blog post which I believe truly resounds with what this trip has become and the transformation it has made...

<p><i>My name is Kecia Lee
and I want to thank you so much for taking the time to visit my Indiegogo
page!  I need your help to get me into the
renowned Thai Yoga Massage program lead by master Deon De Wet!  I’m a full-time yoga instructor and my desire
has always been to help facilitate healing in others.  As you may have guessed, the living of a
yoga-instructor is very humble. We do it for the LOVE of it.  So, I’m calling on the support of others who
believe in my work to help me pay my tuition to Deon’s program.  Below I’ve shared a little about my vision,
WHO I am, and WHY my work will benefit those in need!  I hope that you find my journey inspirational
enough to help me see my dream through! 
Thanks again for your consideration!

<p><i>Healing &amp; Joy To
You,</i></p>
<p><i>Kecia</i></p>
<p><b><i>My GRAND VISION to bring yoga therapy to a</i></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-style: italic;""><i>thletes:</i></b></p>
<p>Every idea starts with a DREAM, right?  I believe in dreaming big, audaciously
big!  My big audacious goal is to work
with collegiate and pro-athletes. 
Why?  Having been a former
competitive soccer player myself, I understand the athlete’s need for
traditional yoga and Thai yoga massage. 
I remember all too well how the feeling of tense muscles, heavy with
lactic acid made feel like I was dragging cinder blocks with each sprint.  I can still remember balled-up hamstrings and
I.T. bands so taunt that a single quick change in direction could have easily
snapped my knee on more than one occasion. 
I remember injury.  There rarely
was a player that could go through an entire season injury-free.  Unheard of. 
So I started to think, “What if I could help collegiate athletes to
become faster, stronger, more agile, and all around healthier in their
bodies?  Why stop there?  What if I could help pro athletes earn an
edge against competitors who are equally skilled”?  Let’s face it, at the pro level the variance
in skill level reduces dramatically.  As
a pro, you are up against the best of the best and it takes a lot of talent and
training to stand out.  Even more, in
the case of both the collegiate and the pro player, his or her body is an
ASSET.  Careers end abruptly every day
due to injury.  I know how hard athletes
train, and losing opportunity or financial security due to injury is just heart
breaking.  Nobody wants to see the blood,
sweat, and tears of a competitor’s dedication and sacrifice flushed down the
drain to an injury that could have been prevented.  </p>
<p>If I sound passionate, it’s because I am!  I have immense respect for the commitment and
drive of competitive sports players.  It
takes an exceptional human being to make it to D1 sports or to go pro.  Selfishly, I want to be surrounded by those
exceptional people.  We as individuals
become our best when we surround ourselves with the best!  I can think of nothing more gratifying, more
inspiring, or more exciting than a life designed to helping the world’s best
athletes achieve peak performance and long-lasting careers through Thai yoga
massage therapy.</p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p>                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431626637/wgmyjhqnkzuocelwebm5.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 335px; height: 335px;""/></p>

regimens Kecia began using yoga as a way to treat old injuries and undo years
of wear and tear to her body.  After
experiencing the benefits of yoga which seemed to “turn back time” on her body,
she was inspired to share that healing through teaching.  </p><p></p><p>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431626580/qycmuca3hdnbmxzcdu3x.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 410.33816425120773px; height: 274px;""/></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>What exactly is Thai Yoga Massage therapy?</i></b></p><p>Thai Yoga Massage is a unique healing system that blends yoga and traditional Thai bodywork.  Integrating many techniques and practices, it is a complete, balanced and deeply therapeutic system of healing.  Practioners guide clients through a series of flowing movements, gentle twists, and deep stretches while applying rhythmic massage along the body’s energy lines &amp; pressure points.  Together these actions result in a full body treatment that relieves muscular tension, pain, and injury.  Thai Yoga Therapy also improves flexibility, range of motion, circulation, relaxation and mental clarity.</p><p></p><p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431626530/dtgb7mrlcdibhmtfaxmm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 418.9808917197452px; height: 299px;""/></p>
<p><b></b></p><p style=""font-style: italic;""><b><i>Why athletes?</i></b></p><p>If you are or once were a serious athlete like Kecia and you are reading this, you know that athletes rarely stretch and hardly ever receive bodywork.  In fact, most athletes LOATHE stretching, which ultimately prolongs their recovery after high-intensity workouts and increases their risk to pain and injury.  Even more, in order to reach maximal gains in physical training and competition, it is important that athletes achieve full range of motion within body movements.  If muscles are overly stiff, shortened or restricted, range of motion declines and athletes cannot effectively recruit smaller muscle groups/muscle fibers to complete a physical action.  The moral of the story is:  INCREASED RANGE OF MOTION = MORE MUSCLE FIBERS RECRUITED TO COMPLETE AN ACTION = A STRONGER, FASTER, HEALTHIER AHLETE.  In sports, agility and efficiency reign king.  Thai yoga therapy gives sports players the competitive edge they need to be the best.</p><p style=""font-style: italic;""></p><p>                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431627041/vzwyd3uhltutijcoao1q.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 208.52459016393442px; height: 320px;""/></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>How does it work?  Can you be

Myofacial release is designed to increase the elasticity of the body’s fascia.  <i>What

thin, sticky webbed-like sheath that encases muscles, bones, organs, nerves,
vessels, and so on.  Fascia is by nature
very elastic.  However, repetitive use of
certain muscles groups, muscle trauma through sports training, and injury can
cause fascia to harden, shorten, or scar.

<br/></div>","Hi Friends! 
My name is Kecia Lee
and I want to thank you so much for taking the time to visit my Indiegogo
page!  I need your help to get me into the
renowned Thai Yoga Massage program lead by master Deon De Wet!  I’m a full-time yoga instructor and my desire
has always been to help facilitate healing in others.  As you may have guessed, the living of a
yoga-instructor is very humble. We do it for the LOVE of it.  So, I’m calling on the support of others who
believe in my work to help me pay my tuition to Deon’s program.  Below I’ve shared a little about my vision,
WHO I am, and WHY my work will benefit those in need!  I hope that you find my journey inspirational
enough to help me see my dream through! 
Thanks again for your consideration! 

Healing & Joy To
You,
Kecia
My GRAND VISION to bring yoga therapy to athletes:
Every idea starts with a DREAM, right?  I believe in dreaming big, audaciously
big!  My big audacious goal is to work
with collegiate and pro-athletes. 
Why?  Having been a former
competitive soccer player myself, I understand the athlete’s need for
traditional yoga and Thai yoga massage. 
I remember all too well how the feeling of tense muscles, heavy with
lactic acid made feel like I was dragging cinder blocks with each sprint.  I can still remember balled-up hamstrings and
I.T. bands so taunt that a single quick change in direction could have easily
snapped my knee on more than one occasion. 
I remember injury.  There rarely
was a player that could go through an entire season injury-free.  Unheard of. 
So I started to think, “What if I could help collegiate athletes to
become faster, stronger, more agile, and all around healthier in their
bodies?  Why stop there?  What if I could help pro athletes earn an
edge against competitors who are equally skilled”?  Let’s face it, at the pro level the variance
in skill level reduces dramatically.  As
a pro, you are up against the best of the best and it takes a lot of talent and
training to stand out.  Even more, in
the case of both the collegiate and the pro player, his or her body is an
ASSET.  Careers end abruptly every day
due to injury.  I know how hard athletes
train, and losing opportunity or financial security due to injury is just heart
breaking.  Nobody wants to see the blood,
sweat, and tears of a competitor’s dedication and sacrifice flushed down the
drain to an injury that could have been prevented.  
If I sound passionate, it’s because I am!  I have immense respect for the commitment and
drive of competitive sports players.  It
takes an exceptional human being to make it to D1 sports or to go pro.  Selfishly, I want to be surrounded by those
exceptional people.  We as individuals
become our best when we surround ourselves with the best!  I can think of nothing more gratifying, more
inspiring, or more exciting than a life designed to helping the world’s best
athletes achieve peak performance and long-lasting careers through Thai yoga
massage therapy.                                
Some questions you may be asking yourself….  Who is this girl anyway?Kecia Lee is a San Diego based yoga teacher, health nut, and beach bum.  In the yoga studio, her infectious smile, warmth, and passion allow her to connect deeply with and inspire her students.  An avid food lover and wellness coach, she is also passionate about sharing healthy, whole, mouth-watering recipes.  Her mission is to help others live with vitality and unlock their most joyful expression of life.Kecia is a former competitive club soccer player, top
national recruit, and scholarship player for the University of Minnesota.  She spent 8 years training with and competing
with the Olympic Development Program and Women’s Region II Team.  After years performing maniacal fitness
regimens Kecia began using yoga as a way to treat old injuries and undo years
of wear and tear to her body.  After
experiencing the benefits of yoga which seemed to “turn back time” on her body,
she was inspired to share that healing through teaching.                          What exactly is Thai Yoga Massage therapy?Thai Yoga Massage is a unique healing system that blends yoga and traditional Thai bodywork.  Integrating many techniques and practices, it is a complete, balanced and deeply therapeutic system of healing.  Practioners guide clients through a series of flowing movements, gentle twists, and deep stretches while applying rhythmic massage along the body’s energy lines & pressure points.  Together these actions result in a full body treatment that relieves muscular tension, pain, and injury.  Thai Yoga Therapy also improves flexibility, range of motion, circulation, relaxation and mental clarity.                      
Why athletes?If you are or once were a serious athlete like Kecia and you are reading this, you know that athletes rarely stretch and hardly ever receive bodywork.  In fact, most athletes LOATHE stretching, which ultimately prolongs their recovery after high-intensity workouts and increases their risk to pain and injury.  Even more, in order to reach maximal gains in physical training and competition, it is important that athletes achieve full range of motion within body movements.  If muscles are overly stiff, shortened or restricted, range of motion declines and athletes cannot effectively recruit smaller muscle groups/muscle fibers to complete a physical action.  The moral of the story is:  INCREASED RANGE OF MOTION = MORE MUSCLE FIBERS RECRUITED TO COMPLETE AN ACTION = A STRONGER, FASTER, HEALTHIER AHLETE.  In sports, agility and efficiency reign king.  Thai yoga therapy gives sports players the competitive edge they need to be the best.                                            How does it work?  Can you be
more specific?

In the unlikely event that a business owner
ceases to grow their business, resources will be redirected to a new business
owner
If a child relocates and there is not a
centre close to them, support can be redirected to benefit another child. 
The Journey
We plan to take every opportunity to unlock
the inherent potential in the lives of multitudes and we want to make it as
real for you as possible. 
We will be sharing stories on our Indiegogo
Campaign Updates Page during the campaign.
Our Radical Readers Face-book page will
also be launched as a reminder of the impact and the importance of being a
#destiny-changer! 
If you are not able to partake in any of
the perks, you can still play a significant part by sharing our campaign with
family and friends or by becoming a volunteer.

What is Jacari?
In order to combat racial intolerance in Oxford City, in 1965 a group of students from Oxford University set up a teaching scheme to volunteer their time teaching English to children in their local community. Today, Oxford has almost double the national average of children who speak English as an additional language (18%) and with research consistently demonstrating the enduring difference in attainment between bilingual children and their peers at every level, Jacari (registered charity 1108827) continues this important work so that every child has the chance to achieve their potential. Jacari works closely with 17 local schools to identify pupils who would benefit from regular additional teaching in order to achieve their academic potential, but would otherwise be unable to access this support.  Led by a full-time coordinator and student committee, each year Jacari trains volunteers from the two universities in Oxford, University of Oxford and Oxford Brookes University, to act as weekly home tutors to these children.

Why is Jacari crowdfunding? 
As reported on BBC news in February, although
last year 200 Jacari volunteers tutored 230 children across the city we still have a waiting list of over 100 local children
who desperately need support. 
With your help we can meet this demand for volunteer
tutors. 
To do this Jacari needs to fundraise all of next year's costs by

is PROJECT WHY ? </b></u>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Project
WHY is an NGO who tries to help slum children by giving them a better education support. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
It
opened its firstclass in 2000 only with 40 children who'd never gone school. Today, Project Why has become a beautiful family that brings
together different parts of India, different social and economic
strata of society, different forms of worship and faith under one
invisible roof big enough to hold everyone together. Today, the
organisation reaches out 1056 Children in 5 different Centers located
in  Delhi slums (At Okhla, Giri Nagar, Madanpur Khader, Govindpuri
and since April 2015, onenear to the Yamuna River).</p>
<p>
More
than that, Project Why is more than a help for children. Its objectives are deeper. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We
try to break barriers - be they caste or social status, and make
Project Why a true reflection of an ideal India. We empower the
community to take on their own responsibility and show them how to
find solutions within their existing context. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<u><b>Why
do we ask your help ? </b></u>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project Why needs your help to keep the doors of its « Special section » open. Located in the Govindpuri Centre, it is reserved to disabled children and young Adults with
special needs. 
</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This Section is essential : It allows these people to live with dignity,
to be more independant, and in some cases find their vocation. In India,
It is a necessity. Indeed, Disabled people have practically no option
within the social system. We are trying to ensure that our students remain integrated within their family and community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<u><b>Facts about the Special Section </b></u>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
The
running cost of this centre, per month, is 52 000 RS (approximately 700 euros) - for 17 children
(12 boys and 5 girls) from 6 to 49 years old. In the special Section
of Project Why, from 9 Am to 4 Pm, Children can find a space where
they can both escape for a few hours every day and laugh to their
heart's content and also a way to keep their ability in mind.
Children are taught self-care and basic living skills such as
bathing, washing clothes, basic cooking, shopping... </p><p>But above all
the daycare centre is a fun filled place where all children are
taught computers, dance and many other recreational activities.
However we are aware of the reality on the ground and the fact that
for some the future remains bleaks and we need to find a long-term alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<u><b>How will your contribution help the ""Special Section"" ?</b></u></p><p>
That
explains why we are asking you for your help. If we can keep the Special Section open, these differently-abled students can retain a roof on their heads, and lead their lives with self-respect and dignity. Your contribution will go directly towards maintenance and upkeep of this section. Indeed, it will help us to create activities suited to the abilities and needs of these students. In your hands, you have the power<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> to ensure some income generation for
each one of them, hence assuring that they retain a roof on their
heads, even after the demise of their parents.</span></p></div>","What

together different parts of India, different social and economic
strata of society, different forms of worship and faith under one
invisible roof big enough to hold everyone together. Today, the
organisation reaches out 1056 Children in 5 different Centers located
in  Delhi slums (At Okhla, Giri Nagar, Madanpur Khader, Govindpuri
and since April 2015, onenear to the Yamuna River).

More
than that, Project Why is more than a help for children. Its objectives are deeper. We
try to break barriers - be they caste or social status, and make
Project Why a true reflection of an ideal India. We empower the
community to take on their own responsibility and show them how to
find solutions within their existing context. 


Why
do we ask your help ? 


Project Why needs your help to keep the doors of its « Special section » open. Located in the Govindpuri Centre, it is reserved to disabled children and young Adults with
special needs. 

This Section is essential : It allows these people to live with dignity,
to be more independant, and in some cases find their vocation. In India,
It is a necessity. Indeed, Disabled people have practically no option
within the social system. We are trying to ensure that our students remain integrated within their family and community.


Facts about the Special Section 



The
running cost of this centre, per month, is 52 000 RS (approximately 700 euros) - for 17 children
(12 boys and 5 girls) from 6 to 49 years old. In the special Section
of Project Why, from 9 Am to 4 Pm, Children can find a space where
they can both escape for a few hours every day and laugh to their
heart's content and also a way to keep their ability in mind.
Children are taught self-care and basic living skills such as
bathing, washing clothes, basic cooking, shopping... But above all
the daycare centre is a fun filled place where all children are
taught computers, dance and many other recreational activities.
However we are aware of the reality on the ground and the fact that
for some the future remains bleaks and we need to find a long-term alternative.


How will your contribution help the ""Special Section"" ?
That
explains why we are asking you for your help. If we can keep the Special Section open, these differently-abled students can retain a roof on their heads, and lead their lives with self-respect and dignity. Your contribution will go directly towards maintenance and upkeep of this section. Indeed, it will help us to create activities suited to the abilities and needs of these students. In your hands, you have the power to ensure some income generation for
each one of them, hence assuring that they retain a roof on their
heads, even after the demise of their parents.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

ABOUT SPACE CAMP

THE BASICS
Learn the history and principles of space propulsion and guidance
systems and put your knowledge to good use when you and your team complete
their mission. Historic achievement of manned space flights will be highlighted
with a tour of the Cosmodome, Canada's largest museum dedicated to spaceflight.

ASTRONAUT and MISSION TRAINING

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>A Short Introduction to the Project</b></p>
<p>Though only a small fraction of
the historic synagogues and other Jewish communal buildings  of Lithuania survived the Holocaust, they are
an essential and integral part of the cultural heritage of Lithuania. None was
more consequential or important than the magnificent Great Synagogue of Vilna (Vilnius), the oldest
and most significant monument of Litvak Jewry. </p>
<p>Sadly, like most of the edifices
of Litvak culture, the Great Synagogue of Vilna was ransacked and destroyed. As
part of the process to find a fitting memorial for the Synagogue and its
associated buildings, we propose the creation of a joint expedition of
Lithuanian, Israeli and American heritage professionals - archaeologists, historians, architects and other scholars, to excavate, preserve and
present<i> in-situ</i> the remains of the Great Synagogue as part of an overall
scheme for the long-lasting safeguarding of the memory of the Jewish community
of Vilnius, the 'Jerusalem of Lithuania'.</p>
<p>The excavation of the Great Synagogue, as a joint project of Lithuanian and
Israeli heritage professionals, presents an opportunity that goes far beyond
the research possibilities that provide for a better understanding of the Great
Synagogue and the surrounding structures of the <i>shulhoyf</i>. By
working together, Lithuanians, Israelis and Litvaks from around the world,
emphasis can be placed on the importance of Jewish built cultural heritage as
an inseparable part of Lithuanian heritage that needs to be celebrated by all
and preserved for perpetuity.<br/><br/>
It is the hope of the team that the joint efforts of professionals, volunteers
and funders of all communities, will meet in a joint project that can bring
together the widely dispersed community of Lithuanians and Litvak Jews while
preserving part of their mutual heritage for the future.<br/></p>

<p>This project has the approval of the Department of Cultural Heritage under the Lithuanian Ministry of Culture and the support of the Jewish Community of Lithuania (Lietuvos Žydu Bendruomene), the Vilna Gaon Jewish State Museum and the History Faculty of Vilnius University.

The excavation will provide us with answers concerning the architecture of this important complex of buildings, while also exposing remains for future presentation.

<br/><br/><b>Why is Izmir significant for refugees?</b><p></p>
<p>Izmir is the one of busiest cities and transit routes to Europe for refugees in Turkey. The city is one of the key points of actual struggle. In the neighborhood of Basmane refugees are easily recognisable, walking the streets with their backpacks and black plastic bags containing their life jackets, for both adults and children. <b>The need for refugee support in Izmir is huge. This cannot be overstated.</b> <br/><br/>We are compelled to do more than simply provide food, water and other necessary items. We want to have a space where refugees and people in Izmir can be together, where people can share support and build relationships. We will encourage people themselves to support refugees, rather than support being something that others do. We will do it. <b>The situation is urgent and it is important that refugees can organise for themselves!</b><br/><br/></p>

However, Izmir is not part of the 'designation system' for (non-Syrian) refugees (around 250,000 people) so huge groups of people live in the streets with little support. The 10 designated cities with camps hold a total of 300,000 people, painfully short for the 2.2 million people left to find themselves shelter.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442477581/hn6bdoxxhpbkr4lfd2vo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Some refugees decide to stay in Izmir while most travel elsewhere, often continuing to nearby Greek islands. The risks of this are extremely high, many people drown, and face huge risks to their physical and mental health. On top of this, the economic cost of travelling is always above 1,000 euros, often multiple times this. However the impacts of war, persecution and poverty are so great that the costs, financially, emotionally, physically and psychologically are worth the risk in hopes of safety. People go to extreme lengths to get this money. So, that's a rough guide to the complex and harsh situation here.                                             </p>

<p>We want to help Romanian Children from poor rural areas, who are not

and develop as other more fortunate children their age.  We want to help
them long enough so that to have a lasting impact on their
lives. </p><p>

work with the children for one week at a time, involve them in activities
that that bring them joy and help them discover themselves and their surroundings, and grow into
independent and self-sufficient individuals. </p><p>
</p><p>We further hope that,
inspired by our example, more people and organizations will take similar
actions. </p><p></p><div>
<p></p>
<p><u>Our First Activity</u></p>
<p>A first activity will take place during the last week of April, in collaboration with a Romanian organization, Tasuleasa Social. 30 children from very poor families, some who cannot afford to go to school, and us, will be housed at Tasuleasa's campus for the entire week.  There we will play together, learn about nature together, take walks and trips together, learn a sport, read stories together, learn to become like brothers and sisters to one another<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Your support</u></p>
<p>Providing housing, food, and access to facilities for one child will cost 35 euro/day, which for 30 children means over 5500 euros. Your much appreciated support would help us cover part of these expenses. The rest we will be paying ourselves. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Saturday afternoon, in a coffee shop in Zürich, a few enthusiasts were heavily debating upon a project. This is how I found Raluca Ciulei, a self-driven, passionate and visionary person, from whom we all could learn something and to whose projects we could be a part of.</p>
<p><strong>House of Romanians in Switzerland (C.R.)</strong>: <em>We’ve been promoting your initiative to support unprivileged children through a non-formal education project. Now we are curious to find out more about you.</em><br/><strong>Raluca Ciulei</strong>: I am currently working as a quantitative analyst for an energy company in Bern, after having lived in different parts of the world. At the age of 16, I moved to Germany due to my professional tennis career, then at the age of 19 I had the chance to study at an Ivy League university, where I was awarded a leadership scholarship. This was followed by 2 years on the professional tennis tour, after which I arrived in Switzerland, where I studied Mathematics at ETH Zürich and where I am currently living.</p>

<p><strong>C.R.:</strong> <em>You lived less than 18 years in Romania- considerably less than most of the Romanians in Switzerland, who moved here only later, to work or to study. What drives you to have such an initiative for your home country?</em><br/><strong>R.C.:</strong> There is something that comes from within and that has always been there- a drive, a feeling, a vision to bring change where it is needed. I believe that in Romania, as in any other society or community, if we care for the children, we can bring change.  I want to start with the unprivileged children, with whom the fate was less giving.</p>

<p><strong>C.R.:</strong> <em>Have you done any entrepreneurial activity before? Starting a project of this magnitude from scratch requires a certain courage and ambition, traits that not any student from a highly ranked university, nor any performer has.</em><br/><strong>R.C.:</strong> No, I have never done anything similar before. However, everything I have achieved so far, I did on my own, without anybody’s help, in a perpetual learning by doing. Everything came from within, and everything I wanted and I felt like doing, I did. I have always felt that I will implement such a project one day!</p>
<p><strong>C.R.:</strong> <em>Congratulations! Now tell us more about the project and about your vision.</em><br/><strong>R.C.:</strong> As I have already mentioned, I believe that caring for a child will not only improve his life but also the life of his community. I also believe in active involvement from our side, rather than a passive one.<br/>I further hope that others will follow our example.<br/><br/><strong>C.R.: </strong><em>It is a complex project on informal education. Could you give us more details?</em><br/><strong>R.C.: </strong>At this stage of the project, the program is not thoroughly defined. The activities that will take place shall bring joy to the children, shall help them discover themselves and learn valuable lessons for their lives.  We will encourage learning by doing and look to facilitate as many experiences for the children as possible. We further believe in leading by example, hence we are aware that the children will learn from our ways of treating ourselves and the children, from the way we interact with each other, from the way we enjoy what we do.<br/>They will be the ones to decide what they would like to do and learn and when. We will only be there to encourage them to discover things by themselves and help each other.<br/>Through playing, sports, social interaction, trips, these children will start discovering themselves, their surrounding and the richness that lies within them. They will also learn to help and support each other and to care for each other, for the environment and for their community.</p>
<blockquote><p>The education in too many places today has too many imposed topics that do not encourage the curiosity the children have.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>C.R.:</strong> <em>How did you have the idea to implement informal education in such a project?</em><br/><strong>R.C.: </strong>My experience at elite universities, in the jobs I’ve had and with the people I’ve interacted with showed me that nowadays education and society impose too many restrictions, rules and beliefs upon us about what we should and should not do. These rules, often combined with subtle forms of punishment, shut down our creativity, courage, enthusiasm, deprive us of our freedom, transform us into competitors and slaves of work, until we reach the gates of hell and realize that the road was more than foreign to us.  My very own experience sits behind my idea. In order to witness alternative education at work, I attended classes at Steiner/Waldorf School (schools based on autonomous learning) and seminars on Natural Learning as encountered in the LAIS schools for example, where children are encouraged to discover everything by themselves, at their own pace, and to teach each other. The education in too many places today has too many imposed topics that do not encourage the curiosity the children have. Education, as we often experience it, offers answers, imposes solving algorithms, it is based on too much theory and too little practice - in contrast, this new form allows the children to become more self-confident, to become autonomous by answering their own questions by themselves with enthusiasm, courage, creativity and curiosity. Children should not be interrupted; we have to stop clipping their wings. The pedagogues have only the role to observe and guide them, eventually answering them with another question, when they hit a dead-end. </p>
<p><strong>C.R.:</strong> <em>Do you believe that such an approach could be successful in Romania because it contrasts very well the methods that have already been applied, or even compensates the lack of professionalism at some levels in the educational system?</em><br/><strong>R.C.:</strong> I believe in the effectiveness of informal education regardless of the society where it is being applied.<br/>In western Europe, as well as in Romania, the idea of success has to be redefined: we cannot continuously repeat to our children that if and only if they become, let’s say, doctors, they will be someone. As long as you are doing what you are passionate about and you keep alive the desire to explore, you are successful. Maybe this is the way towards a world with less depression and with fewer people forced to follow a certain career trajectory, one where the individual freedom is truly encouraged.</p>
<blockquote><p>All they have is the richness within and the joy to have each other.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>C.R.:</strong> <em>Why is the program then applied in rural poor areas?</em><br/><strong>R.C.:</strong> Children here have the least support, they are almost forgotten by the society and considered only part of some statistics, not to say, they barely get to see anything from this big world. All they have is the richness within and the joy to have each other. We want to help them discover exactly these two things, to become more confident and self-sufficient, and to help one another.</p>
<p><strong>C.R.:</strong> <em>How could people that are interested in the project contribute at this point?</em><br/><strong>R.C.:</strong> Since it is the first time we organize such an event, we are counting on the help of a Romanian organization, Tasuleasa Social, that will help us with accommodation, food, their pedagogical forest and other resources that they might have. All these will cost us 35 euro per day per child. I will personally go to Tasuleasa next week, to meet the people there, see their facilities and clarify the program for the 30 children we will be taking care of. Since the costs will be over 5500 euro, from which I myself paid 1500 euro and other wonderful friends donated about 600 euros, 3400 euro are still needed. Every contribution and expense is being recorded, and I will provide receipts for the expenses.<br/>Donations of toys or cloths are very welcome too.

</div></div>","CARE FOR THE CHILDREN AND YOU WILL HELP A LIFE, A COMMUNITY, A REGION, THE WORLD!Our VisionEvery child matters! Help them in an active way until they get a feel for who and how they are, of the values and treasures that lie within them, of the infinite possibilities that surround them; show them that together is the healthier and wiser way to move forward in life. By succeeding in doing so, you might succeed in improving a live and helping a community, a village, a city, a region, a country, the world!
Our Mission
We want to help Romanian Children from poor rural areas, who are not
given the chance, neither by the society, nor by their surroundings, to grow
and develop as other more fortunate children their age.  We want to help
them long enough so that to have a lasting impact on their
lives. 
We intend to take regular trips to Romania and
work with the children for one week at a time, involve them in activities
that that bring them joy and help them discover themselves and their surroundings, and grow into
independent and self-sufficient individuals. 
We further hope that,
inspired by our example, more people and organizations will take similar
actions. 

Our First Activity
A first activity will take place during the last week of April, in collaboration with a Romanian organization, Tasuleasa Social. 30 children from very poor families, some who cannot afford to go to school, and us, will be housed at Tasuleasa's campus for the entire week.  There we will play together, learn about nature together, take walks and trips together, learn a sport, read stories together, learn to become like brothers and sisters to one another.  

Your support
Providing housing, food, and access to facilities for one child will cost 35 euro/day, which for 30 children means over 5500 euros. Your much appreciated support would help us cover part of these expenses. The rest we will be paying ourselves.

""Interviewing Raluca Ciulei - How active involvement brings change""
http://casa-romanilor.ch/interviewing-raluca-ciulei-how-active-involvement-brings-change-4213

Saturday afternoon, in a coffee shop in Zürich, a few enthusiasts were heavily debating upon a project. This is how I found Raluca Ciulei, a self-driven, passionate and visionary person, from whom we all could learn something and to whose projects we could be a part of.
House of Romanians in Switzerland (C.R.): We’ve been promoting your initiative to support unprivileged children through a non-formal education project. Now we are curious to find out more about you.Raluca Ciulei: I am currently working as a quantitative analyst for an energy company in Bern, after having lived in different parts of the world. At the age of 16, I moved to Germany due to my professional tennis career, then at the age of 19 I had the chance to study at an Ivy League university, where I was awarded a leadership scholarship. This was followed by 2 years on the professional tennis tour, after which I arrived in Switzerland, where I studied Mathematics at ETH Zürich and where I am currently living.
There is something that comes from within and that has always been there- a drive, a feeling, a vision to bring change where it is needed.
C.R.: You lived less than 18 years in Romania- considerably less than most of the Romanians in Switzerland, who moved here only later, to work or to study. What drives you to have such an initiative for your home country?R.C.: There is something that comes from within and that has always been there- a drive, a feeling, a vision to bring change where it is needed.

<h3>Bio_Nick</h3>
<p>Bio_Nick is a 3D Printed prosthetic hand which is actuated using signals from foot and send them to the actuators and it results in the motion of the hand and the complete hand cost for 100USD.</p>
<p>So, I have design prosthesis that can be accessible to everyone around the world to people with limited financial resources and for people with physical disabilities living in rural area.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A personal note</h3>
<p>I want to thank you from my bottom of heart for giving your precious time to learn more about my project. The topic of disability is not just a matter of talk it's a very serious issue that we need to solve not by words but by action because in 4 children near you one is with some kind of disability</p>
<p>The reason why I'm so interested in helping out with prosthetics in developing countries is that during my research I had the chance to meet a small girl personally</p>
<div>
<div> </div>
<p>she was around 5 years old living without any hand and at that time I wondered what could have led her to have this life that she is having and as I researched more on this topic I learned that their lack of health care, safety and financial resources.</p>
<p>So, with all your support one day I hope to go back to not only this girl  but to many other children's and people who are living such a life and help them to get the proper prosthetic care they deserve</p>

<li>Because children grow quickly there are few prosthetic devices available for them which cost thousands of dollars and many families can not afford them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>where will your money go?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Your donation will help me to provide the prosthetic hand Bio_Nick for free to children's and other people who can not afford the prosthetic device. </p>
<p>The first initiative will be to provide about 10 to 20 hands to children's and to people with other age and from their experiences, we will  make  it more comfortable , easy to use and aesthetic . Second, we will start a  social media campaign to make people more aware of this prosthetic care service.</p>

<p>Most students start their first day of kindergarten two years behind the expected educational benchmarks. <strong>  Two years behind from day one! </strong> This gap only widens as students progress through the education system.  (Research references for these statistics can be found at the bottom our story!) </p>
<p><strong>There is an easy fix to this staggering reality. </strong>Reading to infants and toddlers, even when they cannot yet read themselves, puts them on track for starting kindergarten right at the starting line, instead of losing before the race has even begun.   </p>
<p>Our goal is to create a monthly subscription box that contains well-written children's books on topics that are chosen to help students think, learn, and engage with their world.  Our book choices are centered around themes of social justice, equality, education, and fun! </p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles stopping children from starting kindergarten prepared is access to quality books, and parents who are unsure of how best to support their children's reading. Our project aims to help parents overcome this obstacle and to help students who do not have access to books. </p>
<p><strong>We believe that all students, no matter their background, deserve the opportunity to start school just as prepared as their peers. </strong>As teachers ourselves, we also know that funds for supplies for books in the classroom can be hard to come by, and often come out of the teacher's own pockets.  This is something we want to help remedy! </p>
<p><strong>For each box purchased, we will donate a book to a local school or early childhood literacy-related non-profit. </strong> Subscribers can choose between our two home cities of Chicago or Boston for where they would like their donated book to be delivered.  We will personally deliver books to the chosen local public schools each month. </p>
<p>As two teachers with 14 years of educating between us, we have a huge passion for reading and literature.  As former students attending the same college and undertaking the same Master's program in Literacy and Education, we grew our passion for educational and entertaining children's books and have worked hard to incorporate them into our teaching practices. </p>
<p>Our book choices for this project have been hand-picked and reviewed by a school librarian and published Junior Library Guild children's reviewer, a professor of children's literature at the University of Illinois, and two educators with Master's degrees in literacy and designations as literacy specialists.  </p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to put quality literature into the hands of children everywhere and to provide parents with the tools they need to help their readers become lifelong learners. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Each box will include: </strong></p>
<p>Three hand-picked books that deal with the any of the themes of social justice, equality, activism, kindness, empathy, and/or self-esteem</p>
<p>One fun sticker to promote reading (stickers are the best)</p>
<p>One small educational game (because toys are fun!)</p>
<p>Three book labels to personalize your books</p>
<p>One literacy pamphlet with activities/ directions for reading and literacy information for parents to support their children's reading growth with research-backed practices</p>
<p><strong>Example book titles include: </strong></p>
<p>Ada Twist Scientist</p>
<p>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind</p>
<p>Separate is Never Equal</p>
<p>Firebird: Misty Copeland</p>
<p>Free as a Bird: The Story of Malala</p>
<p>Click Clack Moo: Cows that Type </p>
<p>Ada's Violin</p>
<p>And many more! </p>
<p><strong>The funds from this Kickstarter will be used for the following business supplies: </strong></p>
<p>- Books!  (this is the biggest, but most important cost!)</p>
<p>-packaging and shipping materials</p>
<p>-website costs</p>
<p>-storage space</p>
<p>-pamphlet printing costs</p>
<p>-advertising costs</p>

</div></div>","Most students start their first day of kindergarten two years behind the expected educational benchmarks.   Two years behind from day one!  This gap only widens as students progress through the education system.  (Research references for these statistics can be found at the bottom our story!) 
There is an easy fix to this staggering reality. Reading to infants and toddlers, even when they cannot yet read themselves, puts them on track for starting kindergarten right at the starting line, instead of losing before the race has even begun.   
Our goal is to create a monthly subscription box that contains well-written children's books on topics that are chosen to help students think, learn, and engage with their world.  Our book choices are centered around themes of social justice, equality, education, and fun! 
One of the biggest obstacles stopping children from starting kindergarten prepared is access to quality books, and parents who are unsure of how best to support their children's reading. Our project aims to help parents overcome this obstacle and to help students who do not have access to books. 
We believe that all students, no matter their background, deserve the opportunity to start school just as prepared as their peers. As teachers ourselves, we also know that funds for supplies for books in the classroom can be hard to come by, and often come out of the teacher's own pockets.  This is something we want to help remedy! 
For each box purchased, we will donate a book to a local school or early childhood literacy-related non-profit.  Subscribers can choose between our two home cities of Chicago or Boston for where they would like their donated book to be delivered.  We will personally deliver books to the chosen local public schools each month. 
As two teachers with 14 years of educating between us, we have a huge passion for reading and literature.  As former students attending the same college and undertaking the same Master's program in Literacy and Education, we grew our passion for educational and entertaining children's books and have worked hard to incorporate them into our teaching practices. 
Our book choices for this project have been hand-picked and reviewed by a school librarian and published Junior Library Guild children's reviewer, a professor of children's literature at the University of Illinois, and two educators with Master's degrees in literacy and designations as literacy specialists.  
Our goal is to put quality literature into the hands of children everywhere and to provide parents with the tools they need to help their readers become lifelong learners. 
Each box will include: 
Three hand-picked books that deal with the any of the themes of social justice, equality, activism, kindness, empathy, and/or self-esteem
One fun sticker to promote reading (stickers are the best)
One small educational game (because toys are fun!)
Three book labels to personalize your books
One literacy pamphlet with activities/ directions for reading and literacy information for parents to support their children's reading growth with research-backed practices
Example book titles include: 
Ada Twist Scientist
The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind
Separate is Never Equal
Firebird: Misty Copeland
Free as a Bird: The Story of Malala
Click Clack Moo: Cows that Type 
Ada's Violin
And many more! 
The funds from this Kickstarter will be used for the following business supplies: 
- Books!  (this is the biggest, but most important cost!)
-packaging and shipping materials
-website costs
-storage space
-pamphlet printing costs
-advertising costs
- goodies included in each box

<h3><strong>This Holiday Season Invest in Peace and Innovation </strong></h3>
<p>We are a group of teachers who saw that our current education system was broken. Our kids were exhausted and stressed and our peers were leaving the classroom in droves. We knew we could do better. </p>
<p>All children deserve the chance to negotiate a life rich with choices. Yet for too many external factors trigger a semi-permanent state of fight or flight that renders them unable to focus on anything else. In addition to academic skills taught in schools, students need to develop skills early on in life to help them process and regulate complex emotions and manage persistent stress.</p>
<p>Headstand was founded to address these complex issues.  </p>
<p><strong>When you meditate you are building character as you learn . . . It feels like I am gaining unimaginable power inside me. I feel stronger.</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Seventh Grade Student, KIPP Summit Academy </strong></p>
<p>This campaign helps us<strong> </strong>imagine the future of K-12 education<strong> </strong>with two innovation labs in the San Francisco Bay Area. These two schools will receive a full-time, dedicated teacher on site to build yoga, mindfulness, and meditation into the everyday experience of the students on campus. Students need and deserve a system that prioritizes compassion and self-knowledge as much as test scores.   </p>
<p><i>A group of scientists at <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/01/eight-weeks-to-a-better-brain/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harvard</a> discovered that in just eight weeks, mindfulness meditation decreases grey dense matter in the amygdala, a region of the brain associated with stress and anxiety.</i><strong>  </strong></p>
<p>When you invest in our Headstand mindfulness and yoga lab, you're creating more peaceful, compassionate and mindful citizens. </p>
<p><strong>Why Should I Become a Headstand Peacemaker?</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Our world—now more than ever—needs more peacemakers. By donating and becoming a Headstand Peacemaker, you’re empowering our future leaders to be calm, focused, and self-aware.</p>
<p>If you are a teacher, a parent, a school leader, a manager, a yogi, a mindfulness skeptic, or just someone who believes in the importance of educating our kids to be agents of peace, join us.</p>
<p>Joining our Giving Tuesday kick-off campaign and become a Headstand Peacemaker. If we reach our goal, we succeed in establishing the foundation of mindfulness and yoga education as a national model for groundbreaking K-12 curriculum.</p>

We are a group of teachers who saw that our current education system was broken. Our kids were exhausted and stressed and our peers were leaving the classroom in droves. We knew we could do better. 
All children deserve the chance to negotiate a life rich with choices. Yet for too many external factors trigger a semi-permanent state of fight or flight that renders them unable to focus on anything else. In addition to academic skills taught in schools, students need to develop skills early on in life to help them process and regulate complex emotions and manage persistent stress.
Headstand was founded to address these complex issues.  
When you meditate you are building character as you learn . . . It feels like I am gaining unimaginable power inside me. I feel stronger.
— Seventh Grade Student, KIPP Summit Academy 
This campaign helps us imagine the future of K-12 education with two innovation labs in the San Francisco Bay Area. These two schools will receive a full-time, dedicated teacher on site to build yoga, mindfulness, and meditation into the everyday experience of the students on campus. Students need and deserve a system that prioritizes compassion and self-knowledge as much as test scores.   
A group of scientists at Harvard discovered that in just eight weeks, mindfulness meditation decreases grey dense matter in the amygdala, a region of the brain associated with stress and anxiety.  
When you invest in our Headstand mindfulness and yoga lab, you're creating more peaceful, compassionate and mindful citizens. 
Why Should I Become a Headstand Peacemaker?

Our world—now more than ever—needs more peacemakers. By donating and becoming a Headstand Peacemaker, you’re empowering our future leaders to be calm, focused, and self-aware.
If you are a teacher, a parent, a school leader, a manager, a yogi, a mindfulness skeptic, or just someone who believes in the importance of educating our kids to be agents of peace, join us.

Technologically inclined engineering professors & students, scientists, electronics hardware & software engineers, automotive engineers and technologists, electronics hobbyists, etc.
For a Novice, the user may follow the included sample App via Bluetooth wireless connectivity to iPhone/iPad to gain mmWave Sensor’s practical experience.
For an Intermediate User, the user may apply the Batman Kit for the Target Application by connecting the Kit to a Raspberry Pi computer, and designing Python software based on the included SDK.
For an Advanced User, the user may utilize The Batman Kit as mmWave Sensor End Device for AI+IoT application with Deep Learning
 And that a Batman Kit package includes:
A Small & Compact application dedicated mmWave Sensor Module based on Texas Instruments (TI) IWR1642 76GHz~81GHz mmWave ASIC , with pin-connection for UART communication.
A Raspberry Pi-Hat Board with optional JBT24M Bluetooth Module (included for the backers of this Indiegogo Campaign!); and that this Hat Board can also work independently of a Raspberry Pi Computer for connecting the mmWave Sensor Module to other MCU based Hardware Board such as an Arduino Board, etc.
A Python SDK on GitHub available for developing software on Raspberry Pi and other computers, which is a perfect companion for AI + IoT Integration Implementation
 While, we are offering three different “flavors” of mmWave Sensor Module with pre-programmed Firmware dedicated to the given evaluation application-flavor of your choice:
The First Module is built-in with Vital Signs Detection Firmware; for a contactless and wearableless and 30cm ~ 90cm (about 1~3 feet) distance detection of Vital Signs (Heartbeat Rate & Respiration Rate) of a person, a pet, or an animal.
The Second Module is built-in with People Movement Behavior Trigger Firmware; for detecting People movement in a 4 x 4 meter or 16 meter square area (or about 172 square feet), and with software that could set virtual geo-fence(s) to trigger alert or action when People are moving into the geo-fence(s).
The Third Module is built-in with High Accuracy Measurement Firmware; for measuring object distance from the mmWave Sensor Module with the range of 30cm ~ 3meters (about 1~10 feet) with millimeter resolution.
  Vital Signs Detection

 


 

 
People Movement Behavior

 


 

 
High Accuracy Measurement



 


 

Note: each of the Batman Kit comes with ONLY ONE mmWave Sensor Module of the dedicated application flavor.
And you may explore other mmWave Sensor application possibilities once you have the understanding on how the mmWave Sensor works; such as in areas of Education, Engineering, Science, Automotive, Industrial, Medical, and Business & Consumer applications.
  On hardware technical side, the Batman Kit’s mmWave Sensor Module is based on state of the art Texas Instruments IWR1642 Single Chip 76GHz ~ 81GHz ASIC with built-in RF Front End having two Transmission and four Receiving Antennae, along with the built-in C674x DSP for high performance FMCW Signal Processing, and also with the built-in ARM Cortex R4F Microcontroller for Configuration, Control, and Calibration; while we provide a direct Raspberry Pi pin-connectivity via our Raspberry Pi-Hat Board (which you may also use it to connect to Arduino or other MCU Boards with physical wiring) for UART communication on interface side. On Software side, the Batman Kit’s mmWave Sensor Firmware facilitates the complex higher physics and higher mathematics raw data analysis (with real-time Fast Fourier Transform, FFT) with robust algorithms that transform the massive & complicated real-time raw data into easy to understand parameter values such as Range, Angle, and Velocity (or Distance, Heartbeat & Respiration Rate pending Firmware programmed) as the output of mmWave Sensor, which will be pipelined as the input for user’s application (via UART communication).  In addition, the Batman Kit includes iOS and Python Open Source SDK that allow the user to implement faster on programming the corresponding software on iPhone/iPad and/or Raspberry Pi computer for Vital Signs Detection, People Movement Behavior Trigger, or High Accuracy Measurement.       The Python SDK can accept either mmWave Sensor’s Raw-Data or Key-Data from Firmware on TI IWR1642 (via UART Tx/Rx); while the iOS SDK can only accept Key Data from Firmware on TI IWR1642 ASIC (via Bluetooth).  The Python SDK with Raw-Data provides an abundant high speed mmWave raw sensing data that allows the user to work on post processing for an application on a Raspberry Pi Computer (which is a very popular programmable computer platform for teachers and students, that has sold over 23Million units in about 6-years span to end of year 2018; and with tens of thousands young people, teachers, and hobbyists alike engaging in programming and learning digital skills). And the Key-Data for both Python SDK and iOS SDK provides an easy to understand with simplified mmWave sensing data for direct output to a Raspberry Pi Computer or an iPhone/iPad; which will serve as a quick introduction to mmWave Sensor world for those without getting deeply into programming.     In addition, the Batman Kit is a perfect companion for AI+IoT integration implementation.  The Batman Kit can be used as an IoT Sensor End Device, that collects Sensor parameter values to Cloud for Sensor info sharing & analysis.  Moreover, the collected Sensor data can be aggregated to become Big Data suitable for AI/Machine Learning/Deep Learning for further application analysis; and for applications such as: Faulty Motor Vibration Symptom Diagnosis & Categorization for Industrial and Automotive applications, Vital Signs’ Emergency Level Categorization for Healthcare applications, Gesture Type Identification & Categorization for Business and Consumer applications, Object & Obstacle Type Identification & Categorization for various Education, Engineering, and Science applications, etc. The Batman Kit will guide you into the mmWave Sensor world with simplicity, and will lead you into exploring more mmWave Sensor application possibilities.  Specifications:mmWave Sensor Evaluation Module

<p>The Pig Preserve was founded a number of years ago to test a new model of care for rescued farm animals…specifically pigs. Drawing on our 20+ years of experience of running a “traditional” pig sanctuary at that time, we believed that we could create a natural and free environment for rescued pigs of all breeds that would allow the pigs to live “life on their terms” rather than in the confined spaces of barns, stalls and small pens. My wife and I began rescuing miniature pigs around 1988 or 89 on an acre and a half of land. After several years we moved to a 17-acre piece of land in Northern VA where we started our first “official” sanctuary…Mini-Pigs, Inc. In 2005 we relocated from Northern VA to a 100-acre piece of land in the Cumberland Mountains of Middle TN where we began building The Pig Preserve. Our goal was to create, for all breeds of pigs, a sanctuary where rescued pigs could have the freedom to live their lives in as natural an environment as we could create for them. Unlike more traditional sanctuaries, we wanted to create a model that allowed the pigs to roam, forage, graze, engage in natural behaviors and, most importantly, form their own social groups. With an equal mix of lush pastures, deep woods and four spring-fed ponds, pigs living here are never penned and are able to explore the entire sanctuary property. Barns and<br/>shelters are provided for each individual social group…currently 24 shelters are in use. The pigs<br/>are fed a custom-made, all-natural grain feed daily, which contains no chemicals, preservatives<br/>or additives other than diatomaceous earth…a natural product for controlling parasites. The<br/>Pig Preserve goes to extraordinary lengths to cater to the needs of the pigs and to allow them<br/>to live their lives on their terms. It is a unique sanctuary model for farmed animals and one that<br/>has gotten a great deal of positive interest not only in the US but from several countries in<br/>Europe and Central and South America as well.</p>
<p>The 100-acre pristine land in the mountains of Tennessee is a perfect blend of pastures, deep woods and spring-fed ponds where the pigs can roam, root, graze, forage and…possibly most importantly…form their own social groups. The 170 or so rescued pigs…a mixture of huge farm pigs, shy feral pigs (wild boars) and miniature pigs…enjoy a healthy, happy, safe and largely human-free existence. They live their lives as nature intended them to live, supervised by a small, dedicated staff of caretakers who see to their daily care and feeding and tend to their medical needs while maintaining the facility in a natural and pristine state. The result is a population of rescued pigs who, despite prior lives of trauma, abuse, maltreatment and fear of death, are healthy, happy, long-lived and extremely well-adjusted animals. They are truly living ""life on their terms”.</p>
<p>As our population has grown, the need to expand the facility has become more critical. Can you help us with our most immediate goals?</p>
<p>*EXPANSION - Increase the amount of land available for the pigs taking advantage of several areas of the existing property that have not yet been fenced and made available to the pigs.</p>
<p>*MEDICAL/QUARANTINE BARN - Establish a dedicated quarantine and “sick pig” facility both to house new arrivals who need veterinary care and to care for our pigs as they age and become infirmed. This area would also serve as a quarantine area for incoming pigs and could accommodate the occasional rescued piglets or very young pigs until they are old enough to join the general pig population safely.</p>
<p>*WELCOME CENTER - Create a modest welcome and education center for our growing number of visitors from around the world and increase our vegan outreach program. This is a fantastic opportunity to dovetail the mission and the magic that is The Pig Preserve, an all-vegan campus, with strong advocacy for a plant-based lifestyle that should not be allowed to slip through our fingers.</p>
<p>*COMPASSION CENTER - Build a covered outdoor space that has unlimited potential for educational and fundraising opportunities. We will be able to host special groups, yoga classes, weddings, etc.</p>
<p>""After running a pig sanctuary for almost 20 years, I knew the pigs in my care were safe, loved,<br/>well-fed and well-cared for. The question that nagged me constantly was “Are they happy?”<br/>So…I asked the pigs what they wanted and they told me: “We want the gift of freedom…we<br/>want to live our lives on our terms”. So that is what I set out to provide for them as I began<br/>building The Pig Preserve…a sanctuary that allowed the pigs to live their lives in as natural a<br/>setting as I could provide for them.""          ~Richard Hoyle, Founder</p>
<p>""I knew from the first minute I laid eyes on the sanctuary, that I would be lucky to make this place my rescue home. The energy here is peaceful and calm. The animals are content and spend their days however they choose to. And just in showing us who they are, they teach us such important lessons about life, love and everything in between.""          ~Afton Hughes, Farm Manager</p>
</div><div>We are the largest pig sanctuary in the country, and we have been rescuing pigs for over 30 years now. We have a successful program with limitless potential for growth, and we are so excited to see what we can do together!

*MEDICAL/QUARANTINE BARN - Establish a dedicated quarantine and “sick pig” facility both to house new arrivals who need veterinary care and to care for our pigs as they age and become infirmed. This area would also serve as a quarantine area for incoming pigs and could accommodate the occasional rescued piglets or very young pigs until they are old enough to join the general pig population safely.
*WELCOME CENTER - Create a modest welcome and education center for our growing number of visitors from around the world and increase our vegan outreach program. This is a fantastic opportunity to dovetail the mission and the magic that is The Pig Preserve, an all-vegan campus, with strong advocacy for a plant-based lifestyle that should not be allowed to slip through our fingers.
*COMPASSION CENTER - Build a covered outdoor space that has unlimited potential for educational and fundraising opportunities. We will be able to host special groups, yoga classes, weddings, etc.
""After running a pig sanctuary for almost 20 years, I knew the pigs in my care were safe, loved,well-fed and well-cared for. The question that nagged me constantly was “Are they happy?”So…I asked the pigs what they wanted and they told me: “We want the gift of freedom…wewant to live our lives on our terms”. So that is what I set out to provide for them as I beganbuilding The Pig Preserve…a sanctuary that allowed the pigs to live their lives in as natural asetting as I could provide for them.""          ~Richard Hoyle, Founder
""I knew from the first minute I laid eyes on the sanctuary, that I would be lucky to make this place my rescue home. The energy here is peaceful and calm. The animals are content and spend their days however they choose to. And just in showing us who they are, they teach us such important lessons about life, love and everything in between.""          ~Afton Hughes, Farm Manager
We are the largest pig sanctuary in the country, and we have been rescuing pigs for over 30 years now. We have a successful program with limitless potential for growth, and we are so excited to see what we can do together!

<h3>What We Do and Why We're on IGG</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Paola, the founder and sole proprietor of Limno Consulting, a consulting &amp; research firm founded in 2012 to provide solutions to mitigate or fix human-caused environmental problems in inland freshwater ecosystems. I founded Limno Consulting with the idea of doing environmental consultancy, which is my passion and was professionally trained on since graduate school, and at the same time conducting some hands-on academic-level research. The original idea was that the consultancy business would have funded the research.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have been experiencing a business crunch as of lately, as the larger projects have run their courses but have not been replaced by new ones in the meantime. (We ecologists live in hard times.) The research part is thriving, though, with new articles being published at a pace of 2-3 per year -- not bad for a one-person business with no in-house help.</p>
<p>A current, regularly updated library of ecological literature is paramount in producing informed consulting reports as it is in producing academic-level publications. Unfortunately, my being in a constant hunt for new projects, maintaining the lab, and writing the papers means that my e-library of around 8000 (and counting) PDF articles has been progressively neglected and is now (dis)organized as several unconnected folders on my computer's hard drive. So, I need someone to help me reorganize my e-library -- not an easy task!</p>
<p>Here is the story in more detail:</p>
<ul><li>First of all, let's frame the narrative. ""Limno"" refers to inland (freshwater) aquatic ecosystems, from lakes to ponds, wetlands, and streams of all sizes. So, limnology is <i>de facto</i> synonymous with inland (freshwater) aquatic ecology. As an ecologist, I need to integrate the biological and abiotic aspects of lake/stream ecology, though emphasis remains on the biological component, which is the component more sensitive to environmental changes. I am specialized on lake and, secondarily, stream ecosystems. I am a ""lake doctor"", trying to understand the causes behind some perceived lake problem, and find a ""cure"" once the problem has been diagnosed. Below is a view of (Lake) Østensjøvatn in the southeastern suburbs of Oslo, Norway, as an example of the type of ecosystems that I deal with. Although Østensjøvatn is a habitat for many species of water birds, it suffers from excessive inputs of algal nutrients (eutrophication) and therefore periodic algal blooms. Østensjøvatn has been the target of detailed studies to try to solve these problems. The lake is also infested with the non-native submerged plant <i>Elodea canadensis</i>, also the subject of several studies in which I was fortunate enough to participate as a research partner.</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480599444/eilbkm5ixnh1zdiuciqk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <ul>
<li>As a ""lake doctor"", I need to keep abreast of the current knowledge on how lake ecosystems work. At the same time, I do some hands-on ecological research myself. Both activities require maintaining a current, updated library of books and scientific articles from accredited scientific journals.</li>
<li>The main objective of Limno Consulting is twofold: provide and contribute to limnological know-how in aquatic environmental issues. I am also trying to expand Limno Consulting's mission to draw the attention of current and future college students to the ecology and management of inland ecosystems, the limited source of fresh/potable water for most of the world's human population. Please visit my professional website at <a href=""http://www.limnoconsulting.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.limnoconsulting.com</a> to learn more about limnology and what I do. If you are specifically interested in the research I do, you can visit my professional profile at ResearchGate (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paola_Lombardo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paola_Lombardo</a>), where you can also take a look at and download almost all that I have published so far. Both links open in a new window.</li>
<li>The scientific library at Limno Consulting currently hosts several books and around 8000 -- and counting -- scientific articles, mostly stored as environmentally-friendly PDF documents (no paper involved, so no need to kill trees). As Limno Consulting is a one-person business, I simultaneously serve as everything from janitor (the lab alone needs constant maintenance) to scientific director. As is often the case in situations like this, something gotta give, so my e-library has slowly turned into a disorganized storage of PDFs on my hard drive. Therefore, I need to hire somebody to help me sort through all this literature and reorganize the e-library, so that retrieving the needed information does not turn into a scavenging hunt every time I or my project partners need to consult a paper.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<p>Perks are limnology- and ecology-themed and include T-shirts, mouse pads, mugs, and the 2017 Limno Consulting wall calendar, just out of the printshop.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Shipping rates are kept to a minimum, and are included for most perks going within the European Union. Mugs need special handling and shipping fees are therefore a tad higher. All perks will be shipped via regular postal service as ""priority mail"" within Europe and as air mail or freight mail outside Europe, also depending on what options the Post Office gives me. If you need a faster delivery via private courier, please contact me before or at the moment of address confirmation (I will send you an e-mail for that), and I can arrange that for you. </p>
<p>Most perks are offered as single or double packages. If you are interested in a ""special"" package, or in bulk quantities, or in anything that is not listed in the perk options on the right, please contact me before you claim the perk(s), and I will work out a convenient ""bulk shipping rate"" for you. The idea is to avoid surcharging for multiple credit card purchases and shipping rates, as IGG does not allow the lumping of multiple perks. Once we agree on the special package perk and shipping rate, you can just pledge the money amount in the ""back it"" window at the top right of the campaign page, and... wait for the package to reach you! ""Bulk"" packages may be shipped to you directly from the supplier in The Netherlands.  For single- and double-order perks, I will adopt shipping cycles of 10-15 claims, so popular perks may be shipped even before the expected shipping time of January or February 2017. Once a batch is fulfilled, I will contact you for T-shirt size or color, address confirmation, and any other necessary piece of information. For all claimed perks, shipping will follow a ""first come, first served"" basis.</p>

<p><strong>The 2017 Limno Consulting Wall Calendar</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481030996/ucglixihyl4c8ohzyvzf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The ""featured"" perk is a small (two ~16 x 21 cm sheets to form a ""long"" A4 or legal size format when mounted) wall calendar with 12 unique photos of lakes, streams, or aquatic organisms taken and donated by seven different contributors from all over the world. My heartfelt thanks go to Paolo, Andy, Gianluigi, Marit, Viktor, and Daniel for sharing their beautiful pictures with me! (I am the seventh contributor.)</p>
<p>The calendar text is in English and does not report religious holidays to keep it neutral. Most other holidays and events (like daylight saving time and solstice and equinox times) apply to Europe, North America, and Australia/New Zealand -- i.e., where I expect most of the calendars to be shipped to. Sorry for those special events that I was forced to leave out for space constraints.</p>
<p>In order for you to receive the calendars a.s.a.p., they will be shipped within 2-5 days from your claim. While supplies last!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The ""100%"" Collection</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The ""100%"" collection includes T-shirts, baseball caps, tote bags, mouse pads, and mugs. They are offered in two designs -- 100% limnologist and 100% ecologist -- that emphasize the science-based yet fun-loving spirit of all (aquatic) ecologists. The designs are unique and are an exclusive of this campaign -- you will not find them anywhere else!</p>

<p><strong>Mouse pads</strong> are 3-mm thick and with a full-color ""100%"" print on white background.

<h3>Referral Contest</h3>
<p>You can still earn a perk if you cannot contribute, or you can add an extra perk if you have already claimed one (or more). You can do this by referring this campaign to your network of friends and coworkers via Twitter and/or Facebook. IndieGoGo tracks the contributions that stemmed from your referrals via a link to this campaign uniquely assigned to each individual referee.</p>
<p>The top three referrers will ""win"" a special perk:</p>
<ol>
<li>The top referrer will have collected the most contributions adding to at least US$ 500. <u><i>Special perk: one ""100%"" complete set (""the works!"" perk on the right), with no shipping fees.</i></u>
</li>
<li>The second place referrer will have collected the second-highest contributions total adding to at least US$ 250. <u><i>Special perk: one ""100%"" mini-set, with no shipping fees.</i></u>
</li>
<li>Third place will go to the referrer with the third-highest contributions total adding to at least US$ 150.  <u><i>Special perk: your choice of one mug or any two-item combinations excluding mugs (e.g., two t-shirts, t-shirts + mouse pad, t-shirt + cap, etc.), with no shipping fees.</i></u>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In case of a tie within each prize category (e.g., if there are two referrers with &gt;US$ 250 competing for second place), the higher dollar amount will win. In case of a dollar amount tie, the referrer with the higher number of contributions (or, secondarily, visits), will win. The ""loser"" will get the lower-tier prize (in this example, the third-place special perk). If two referrers are still tied as number of visits, they'll both get the higher special perk.</p>
<p>You need to have an IndieGoGo account to be a referrer.  Referrers promote this campaign with IGG’s share tools while logged into their IGG account. This is important because otherwise such a unique ID won’t be attached to any resulting contributions or visits. When you are logged into your IGG account and use IGG’s share tools to send a tweet, for example, the link in the tweet includes your unique ID. Then, when a new backer reads the tweet and clicks through the link to contribute, you are recognized as helping bring in the amount contributed by the new backer.</p>
<p>How to become a referrer:</p>
<p>1. Log into IndieGoGo - <u>you must be logged in to receive credits for your referrals</u>.</p>
<p>2. Visit the Limno Consulting campaign page (or -- log into IGG while you are on the Limno Consulting campaign page), where you can grab your unique link to the right side of the campaign introduction (above the perk list) by clicking the ""link"" button (the chain button highlighted with a cyan arrow):</p>

<p> </p>
<p>You'll see a pop-up with the URL. Notice the numbers at the end -- that's how I know it's you referring your friends.</p>
<p>3. Copy the link and start sharing!</p>
<p>Use your link to share the campaign on social media, email, blog posts, etc.</p>
<p>For example, if you would like to share via Twitter, once you have copied the unique ID link, click on the ""twitter"" symbol, type a brief message, and include your unique ID link.</p>
<p>TWITTER EXAMPLE:""Support the Limno Consulting e-library campaign on @Indiegogo:  <a href=""https://igg.me/at/LimnoCampaign/x/15427889"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/LimnoCampaign2016/x/12345678</a>""</p>
<p>* The '12345678' number on the end will be different for everyone, as that's your unique ID.</p>
<p>When anyone clicks on your unique link, they are taken to the Limno Consulting campaign page. If they back the campaign, they'll be added to your referral collection.</p>

</div></div>","What We Do and Why We're on IGG
Hi! I am Paola, the founder and sole proprietor of Limno Consulting, a consulting & research firm founded in 2012 to provide solutions to mitigate or fix human-caused environmental problems in inland freshwater ecosystems. I founded Limno Consulting with the idea of doing environmental consultancy, which is my passion and was professionally trained on since graduate school, and at the same time conducting some hands-on academic-level research. The original idea was that the consultancy business would have funded the research.
Unfortunately I have been experiencing a business crunch as of lately, as the larger projects have run their courses but have not been replaced by new ones in the meantime. (We ecologists live in hard times.) The research part is thriving, though, with new articles being published at a pace of 2-3 per year -- not bad for a one-person business with no in-house help.
A current, regularly updated library of ecological literature is paramount in producing informed consulting reports as it is in producing academic-level publications. Unfortunately, my being in a constant hunt for new projects, maintaining the lab, and writing the papers means that my e-library of around 8000 (and counting) PDF articles has been progressively neglected and is now (dis)organized as several unconnected folders on my computer's hard drive. So, I need someone to help me reorganize my e-library -- not an easy task!
Here is the story in more detail:
First of all, let's frame the narrative. ""Limno"" refers to inland (freshwater) aquatic ecosystems, from lakes to ponds, wetlands, and streams of all sizes. So, limnology is de facto synonymous with inland (freshwater) aquatic ecology. As an ecologist, I need to integrate the biological and abiotic aspects of lake/stream ecology, though emphasis remains on the biological component, which is the component more sensitive to environmental changes. I am specialized on lake and, secondarily, stream ecosystems. I am a ""lake doctor"", trying to understand the causes behind some perceived lake problem, and find a ""cure"" once the problem has been diagnosed. Below is a view of (Lake) Østensjøvatn in the southeastern suburbs of Oslo, Norway, as an example of the type of ecosystems that I deal with. Although Østensjøvatn is a habitat for many species of water birds, it suffers from excessive inputs of algal nutrients (eutrophication) and therefore periodic algal blooms. Østensjøvatn has been the target of detailed studies to try to solve these problems. The lake is also infested with the non-native submerged plant Elodea canadensis, also the subject of several studies in which I was fortunate enough to participate as a research partner.
 
As a ""lake doctor"", I need to keep abreast of the current knowledge on how lake ecosystems work. At the same time, I do some hands-on ecological research myself. Both activities require maintaining a current, updated library of books and scientific articles from accredited scientific journals.
The main objective of Limno Consulting is twofold: provide and contribute to limnological know-how in aquatic environmental issues. I am also trying to expand Limno Consulting's mission to draw the attention of current and future college students to the ecology and management of inland ecosystems, the limited source of fresh/potable water for most of the world's human population. Please visit my professional website at http://www.limnoconsulting.com to learn more about limnology and what I do. If you are specifically interested in the research I do, you can visit my professional profile at ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paola_Lombardo), where you can also take a look at and download almost all that I have published so far. Both links open in a new window.
The scientific library at Limno Consulting currently hosts several books and around 8000 -- and counting -- scientific articles, mostly stored as environmentally-friendly PDF documents (no paper involved, so no need to kill trees). As Limno Consulting is a one-person business, I simultaneously serve as everything from janitor (the lab alone needs constant maintenance) to scientific director. As is often the case in situations like this, something gotta give, so my e-library has slowly turned into a disorganized storage of PDFs on my hard drive. Therefore, I need to hire somebody to help me sort through all this literature and reorganize the e-library, so that retrieving the needed information does not turn into a scavenging hunt every time I or my project partners need to consult a paper.

 

What We Need & What You Get

All the funds raised will go into hiring a couple of persons to help me with the e-library reorganization and to renew a couple of annual subscriptions for scientific journals. The target amount also includes the estimated IGG platform and credit card fees.
In exchange for your generosity, I have put together some ecology- and limnology-themed perks. Check them out just below!
If this campaign does not reach the entire goal, I will hire only one person who will take the entire task on his/her shoulders, and/or I might forgo the journal subscriptions, depending on how much will be raised at the end of the campaign.
All perk claims will be fulfilled whether the goal is reached or not.
If the campaign raises funds in excess, the extra money will be used for additional journal subscriptions, annual dues for professional affiliations, and/or software upgrades.
Donations can be made via credit card or PayPal. Please be aware that as per PayPal rules, only 10 guest payments are allowed per card for donors within the European Union, i.e., a single credit card can only be used 10 times to check out as a guest. Please let me know if you encounter any problems while checking out.

 
The Perks!
Perks are limnology- and ecology-themed and include T-shirts, mouse pads, mugs, and the 2017 Limno Consulting wall calendar, just out of the printshop.
 

 
Shipping rates are kept to a minimum, and are included for most perks going within the European Union. Mugs need special handling and shipping fees are therefore a tad higher. All perks will be shipped via regular postal service as ""priority mail"" within Europe and as air mail or freight mail outside Europe, also depending on what options the Post Office gives me. If you need a faster delivery via private courier, please contact me before or at the moment of address confirmation (I will send you an e-mail for that), and I can arrange that for you. 
Most perks are offered as single or double packages. If you are interested in a ""special"" package, or in bulk quantities, or in anything that is not listed in the perk options on the right, please contact me before you claim the perk(s), and I will work out a convenient ""bulk shipping rate"" for you. The idea is to avoid surcharging for multiple credit card purchases and shipping rates, as IGG does not allow the lumping of multiple perks. Once we agree on the special package perk and shipping rate, you can just pledge the money amount in the ""back it"" window at the top right of the campaign page, and... wait for the package to reach you! ""Bulk"" packages may be shipped to you directly from the supplier in The Netherlands.  For single- and double-order perks, I will adopt shipping cycles of 10-15 claims, so popular perks may be shipped even before the expected shipping time of January or February 2017. Once a batch is fulfilled, I will contact you for T-shirt size or color, address confirmation, and any other necessary piece of information. For all claimed perks, shipping will follow a ""first come, first served"" basis.
If you have ideas or suggestions for perk variations or new perks, please contact me!
 
The 2017 Limno Consulting Wall Calendar

The ""featured"" perk is a small (two ~16 x 21 cm sheets to form a ""long"" A4 or legal size format when mounted) wall calendar with 12 unique photos of lakes, streams, or aquatic organisms taken and donated by seven different contributors from all over the world. My heartfelt thanks go to Paolo, Andy, Gianluigi, Marit, Viktor, and Daniel for sharing their beautiful pictures with me! (I am the seventh contributor.)
The calendar text is in English and does not report religious holidays to keep it neutral. Most other holidays and events (like daylight saving time and solstice and equinox times) apply to Europe, North America, and Australia/New Zealand -- i.e., where I expect most of the calendars to be shipped to. Sorry for those special events that I was forced to leave out for space constraints.
In order for you to receive the calendars a.s.a.p., they will be shipped within 2-5 days from your claim. While supplies last!
 
The ""100%"" Collection

 
The ""100%"" collection includes T-shirts, baseball caps, tote bags, mouse pads, and mugs. They are offered in two designs -- 100% limnologist and 100% ecologist -- that emphasize the science-based yet fun-loving spirit of all (aquatic) ecologists. The designs are unique and are an exclusive of this campaign -- you will not find them anywhere else!
 
 

T-shirts are in a unisex cut and come in either white or black 100% cotton. Black T-shirts come with a $5 surcharge as per supplier price list. Shirt brand is Fruit of the Loom or equivalent. Print matter and T-shirt live longer with a lukewarm or cold washing machine cycle and cloth line drying or ""delicate cycle"" machine drying. Please refer to the chart below to choose your T-shirt size. Please keep in mind that shirts may shrink slightly upon first washing cycle, so if your size is midway two of the offered sizes below, please round it up.

 
 
 
 

Mouse pads are 3-mm thick and with a full-color ""100%"" print on white background. The black background faded quickly on early tests and therefore black-background mouse pads are not offered here. The pad texture allows for smooth and precise mouse movements. (I have tested it for several months by now.)
 
 

Mugs are offered in both ""100%"" designs and in a unique ""knowledge is power"" design (also an exclusive of this campaign) specifically thought for teachers, students, and book lovers of all types. All mugs feature a full-color print on white background. Unfortunately mugs require special handling and therefore shipment fees are a bit higher for mugs and mug-containing perks.
 
 

Baseball caps are 100% cotton, with the ""100%"" design printed on white background. Open-top canvas tote bags also are 100% cotton, with the ""100%"" design printed on warm (creamy) white background.  Tote dimensions are 36 cm wide x 33 cm high (or 14 in w x 13 in h). Tote bags are washable in a delicate washing machine cycle at lukewarm or cold temperature.
Please see the updates page for details about the added perks (baseball caps and tote bags).
Please contact me before claiming any perk if you need special perk packages not included in the list on the right, so we can work out the cheapest possible shipping rate.

The top referrer will have collected the most contributions adding to at least US$ 500. Special perk: one ""100%"" complete set (""the works!"" perk on the right), with no shipping fees.

The second place referrer will have collected the second-highest contributions total adding to at least US$ 250. Special perk: one ""100%"" mini-set, with no shipping fees.

Third place will go to the referrer with the third-highest contributions total adding to at least US$ 150.  Special perk: your choice of one mug or any two-item combinations excluding mugs (e.g., two t-shirts, t-shirts + mouse pad, t-shirt + cap, etc.), with no shipping fees.


In case of a tie within each prize category (e.g., if there are two referrers with >US$ 250 competing for second place), the higher dollar amount will win. In case of a dollar amount tie, the referrer with the higher number of contributions (or, secondarily, visits), will win. The ""loser"" will get the lower-tier prize (in this example, the third-place special perk). If two referrers are still tied as number of visits, they'll both get the higher special perk.
You need to have an IndieGoGo account to be a referrer.  Referrers promote this campaign with IGG’s share tools while logged into their IGG account. This is important because otherwise such a unique ID won’t be attached to any resulting contributions or visits. When you are logged into your IGG account and use IGG’s share tools to send a tweet, for example, the link in the tweet includes your unique ID. Then, when a new backer reads the tweet and clicks through the link to contribute, you are recognized as helping bring in the amount contributed by the new backer.
How to become a referrer:
1. Log into IndieGoGo - you must be logged in to receive credits for your referrals.
2. Visit the Limno Consulting campaign page (or -- log into IGG while you are on the Limno Consulting campaign page), where you can grab your unique link to the right side of the campaign introduction (above the perk list) by clicking the ""link"" button (the chain button highlighted with a cyan arrow):

 
You'll see a pop-up with the URL. Notice the numbers at the end -- that's how I know it's you referring your friends.
3. Copy the link and start sharing!
Use your link to share the campaign on social media, email, blog posts, etc.
For example, if you would like to share via Twitter, once you have copied the unique ID link, click on the ""twitter"" symbol, type a brief message, and include your unique ID link.
TWITTER EXAMPLE:""Support the Limno Consulting e-library campaign on @Indiegogo:  https://igg.me/at/LimnoCampaign2016/x/12345678""
* The '12345678' number on the end will be different for everyone, as that's your unique ID.
When anyone clicks on your unique link, they are taken to the Limno Consulting campaign page. If they back the campaign, they'll be added to your referral collection.
 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Please spread the word!!  You are welcome to use the IGG share tools, your contact network, e-mail, social networks, tam-tam, smoke signals, or anything you like!
 
 
Thanks a lot for your support!

</p><p>Olá pessoas
queridas!</p>
<p>Sou Carolina, bióloga,
ecóloga e aluna de doutorado em Economia Ambiental pela Universidade de
Brasília. Acho que sou cientista desde criança, quando andava pela praia
observando os bichos na areia. Durante a graduação em Ciências Biológicas
participei duas vezes do Programa de Iniciação Científica, e desde então não
larguei mais a Ciência. Apesar de ser bióloga/ecóloga, escolhi o doutorado em
Economia, porque acredito que o mundo precisa de profissionais
interdisciplinares, que pensam fora da caixa e assim fazem a diferença! Agregar
conhecimentos é melhor que limitar ou segregar! </p><p>Faço essa campanha de
arrecadação de fundos para eu poder participar em dois cursos internacionais,
os quais fui selecionada: um na Flórida, promovido pela University of Florida
(Global Youth Leadership Academy - GYLA), e o outro na University of Oxford (Oxford
Summer School in Ecological Economics 2016). Esses cursos são extremamente
importantes para mim, pois no primeiro, além de ter conseguido um desconto de
20%, terei a experiência de imersão da língua inglesa e em liderança, o que
para uma cientista é essencial! No segundo, que é o que eu fiquei mais
<b>agradecida</b> por ter sido selecionada, irá me prover um conhecimento <b>gigante</b>
dentro da área que eu quero seguir, que é a Economia do Meio Ambiente. Eu saí
do meu emprego para me dedicar aos cursos e ao final do doutorado!
Infelizmente, o Brasil passa por uma fase de “vacas magras” para a ciência e
educação! Por isso, agradeço demais aos que já leram até aqui e àqueles que
puderem contribuir e/ou compartilhar essa campanha por aí! Já fizeram uma
cientista brasileira feliz! :)</p>
<p>Agora vamos aos
cálculos! Para o curso da Flórida, eu preciso de U$2.800 (R$ 9.800,00 aprox.) só
para pagar o curso que oferece estadia e alimentação no período de 30 dias de
curso em Agosto! Além disso, precisarei de U$ 160 (R$560,00 aprox.) para
custear o visto de estudante e U$ 1.200 (R$ 4.000 aprox.) de passagem. Para o
curso em Oxford, precisarei de U$2.300 (R$ 8.020 aprox.) para custear o curso,
a estadia e a alimentação durante os 6 dias de curso em setembro, mais U$ 1.500 (R$ 5.000
aprox.) para passagem aérea. Os custos desse curso são em libras esterlinas (1.575 libras), mas coloquei em dólares para facilitar os cálculos. Somando todos esses custos, dá em torno de U$8.000
(R$ 28.000 aprox.). Peço U$ 11.000 (R$ 38.400,00) para ter uma margem extra
para custear as taxas do site e as passagens mais próximas da data
de embarque! Pois a medida que nos aproximamos da data de embarque, as
passagens tendem a aumentar o valor. Qualquer auxílio, seja compartilhando, ou contribuindo com R$1,00 já ajuda demais!!! </p>
<p>Como a data do curso na Flórida está muito próxima e ainda não consegui o suficiente para custeá-lo, é <b>bem provável</b> que eu vá <b>somente</b> para o curso em <b>Oxford</b>! Portanto, se eu conseguir metade do que estou pedindo (U$ 5.500) já estarei completamente realizada! Acho que esse curso em Oxford trará maior retorno para a minha vida acadêmica e profissional! E
é o curso que eu estou mais animada e eufórica! :) </p><p>E, caso eu consiga além do valor, ou ainda não dê tempo de eu conseguir o visto para o primeiro curso, destinarei a verba para a participação de dois congressos internacionais: o ""18th Annual BioEcon Conference: Instruments and Incentive Mechanisms for Biodiversity Conservation and Ecosystem Service Provision"", a ser realizado em Cambridge, em setembro/2016 e o ""First Latin American Ecosystem Services Partnership Conference"", na Colômbia, em outubro/2016. Em ambos com a apresentação de trabalhos! :) </p>
<p>Ainda existem
poucas pessoas no Brasil que sejam corajosas e que tenham a visão de “mudar” de
curso para complementar um conhecimento. As dificuldades são muitas e muitas
são as barreiras a serem vencidas! Acredito que as áreas se interconectam e que
cada vez mais precisamos disso na ciência em prol de um bem maior. Por isso, contribuindo
com esse projeto, você estará contribuindo com a formação interdisciplinar de
uma cientista com a visão um pouco para frente, que acredita que pode
contribuir para novos rumos da ciência na área ambiental. Assim, estará auxiliando

</p><p>I'm
Carolina, a biologist, ecologist and doctoral student in Environmental
Economics at the University of Brasilia. I think I'm a scientist since
childhood, when I walked along the beach observing little animals in the sand.
During my graduation in Biological Sciences, I have participated twice on the
Scientific Initiation Program and since then I have never dropped academic life.
Despite being a biologist/ecologist, I chose doing my PhD in economics, because
I believe the world needs interdisciplinary professionals, who think outside
the box and make a difference! Adding knowledge is better than limit or

<p>I am making this fundraising campaign to be able to afford and
participate in two international courses, which I was selected: one in Florida,
sponsored by the University of Florida (Global Youth Leadership Academy -
GYLA), and the other at the University of Oxford (Oxford Summer School in
Ecological Economics 2016). These courses are extremely important to me! The
second course is the most important one, because it is directly related with my
doctoral thesis and there is none course like this in Brazil. I was very thankful
for being selected at this course because it will provide a huge knowledge in
environmental economic field, which is the area that I want to follow. I quit
my job to dedicate exclusively to the end of my doctorate and to these courses!
Unfortunately, Brazil is going through a phase of lean year for education and
science. So, thanks very much those who have read this far and those who can
contribute and/or share this campaign. </p>
<p>Now, let’s
do the math! To travel to Florida, I’ll need U $ 2,800, just to pay for the
course that provides room and board during the 30-day course in August! Also,
I'll need U $ 160 to fund the student visa and $ 1,200 for flight tickets. To travel
to Oxford I will need $ 2,300 to pay for the course, stay and food during the
7-day course in September and another $ 1,500 for airfare. The costs of this
course are in pounds (1,575 pounds), but I put it in dollars to facilitate the calculations.
Adding all these costs, gives around $ 8,000. I am asking for $ 11,000 to have
an extra margin to pay site fees and the flights tickets nearest of the date of
shipment! As we approach the date of shipment, the tickets tend to increase the
value. Any aid either sharing or contributing it will be really helpful.</p>
<p>As the date
of GYLA course in Florida is very close and I could not get enough to pay for it,
it's most likely that I only go to the course in Oxford! So if I get half of
what I'm asking ($ 5.500) I'll be fully fulfilled!</p>
<p>If I get beyond the value, I’ll destine the funds for the participation
of two international conferences: the ""18th Annual BioEcon Conference:
Instruments and Incentive Mechanisms for Biodiversity Conservation and
Ecosystem Service Provision "", which it’ll be held in Cambridge in
September/2016 and the"" First Latin American Ecosystem Services
Partnership Conference "", in Colombia in October/2016.</p>
<p>There are still a few people in Brazil who have courageous and have vision
of ""change"" the main field to supplement your knowledge. The
difficulties are many and there are many barriers to overcome! I believe that
different areas of knowledge are interconnected and we need more and more
interconnected knowledge in science for the sake of a greater good. Therefore
contributing with this project, you will be contributing to the
interdisciplinary training of a scientist who has a vision a little forward,
which believes that she can contribute to new directions of science in the

</h3> <p>I founded Stomp and Shout Chicago in 2013 with a clear mission,<b> "" to innovate inspiring ways to bring music, art, and theatre to kids and their families""</b>. I was seeing SO many arts programs that were offering the ""same old thing"". SO many programs that were offering a limited slice of the delicious arts pie. I believe the best kinds of Arts Classes are less concerned with training the next Broadway star, and are more concerned with growing their student's confidence, inspiring team work, strengthening problem solving skills, deepening creative and critical thinking skills, and growing big, beautiful imaginations. <i>Speaking of imagination -- take  a minute to imagine what our kid's adult lives would like with these tools at their disposal? It's pretty thrilling to imagine, right? </i><br/></p>
<h4>Back to that mission. Let's breakdown how we aim to serve that statement: </h4>
<h2> </h2>
<ul> <li>We provide an Arts Foundation for all of our families so that they can continue to sing, play, and create for years to come. <br/>
</li> <li>We spark imaginative conversations in class with the goal that this imaginative language develops at home. <br/>
</li> <li>We bring arts programming to families that may not have the resources to attend an arts class on their own. (See specifically our partnership with Rivendell Theatre Ensemble on the <a href=""http://www.stompandshoutchicago.com/strong-girls-make-stuff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strong Girls Make Stuff Program</a> as well as our <a href=""http://www.stompandshoutchicago.com/classroom-faqs-policies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Play For Everyone Program</a> that reserves two free seats in each session of our Early Childhood Programming for families that are having financial difficulties). <br/>
</li>
<li>We foster community between families and their neighborhoods. We like to say we're helping to create mom and pop tribes. <br/>
</li>
<li>We create unique {fun} classes that expand our student's artistic horizons. <br/>

<p><i>Winter 2014</i><br/>Cassie partners with Brooklyn based songwriter, Jo Solomon. The merger lands Cassie with amazing songs to develop the early childhood music and creative play program she's been dreaming about for years. It also gives us a sister, Stomp and Shout Brooklyn. </p>
<p><i>Summer 2015 </i><br/>Holy smokes -- 38 enrollments, 3 teachers, 3 locations, and 2 guitarists. <br/></p>
<p><i>Winter 2015</i><br/>Our Early Childhood neighborhoods grow to include: Logan Square (the OG), Roscoe Village, Bucktown, West Loop, and Oak Park. <br/></p>
<p>Stomp and Shout Chicago spearheads it's first program for older kids, Strong Girls Make Stuff at Rivendell Theatre Ensemble. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Growing Artists Citizens of The World 
 I founded Stomp and Shout Chicago in 2013 with a clear mission, "" to innovate inspiring ways to bring music, art, and theatre to kids and their families"". I was seeing SO many arts programs that were offering the ""same old thing"". SO many programs that were offering a limited slice of the delicious arts pie. I believe the best kinds of Arts Classes are less concerned with training the next Broadway star, and are more concerned with growing their student's confidence, inspiring team work, strengthening problem solving skills, deepening creative and critical thinking skills, and growing big, beautiful imaginations. Speaking of imagination -- take  a minute to imagine what our kid's adult lives would like with these tools at their disposal? It's pretty thrilling to imagine, right? 
Back to that mission. Let's breakdown how we aim to serve that statement: 
 
 We provide an Arts Foundation for all of our families so that they can continue to sing, play, and create for years to come. 
 We spark imaginative conversations in class with the goal that this imaginative language develops at home. 
 We bring arts programming to families that may not have the resources to attend an arts class on their own. (See specifically our partnership with Rivendell Theatre Ensemble on the Strong Girls Make Stuff Program as well as our Play For Everyone Program that reserves two free seats in each session of our Early Childhood Programming for families that are having financial difficulties). 

We foster community between families and their neighborhoods. We like to say we're helping to create mom and pop tribes. 

We create unique {fun} classes that expand our student's artistic horizons. 









A Bit Of History: 
September of 2013Our first Early Childhood session begins in Logan Square. At session's end our enrollment was at 9 kids. The class was taught by Cassie with Noah on guitar.Summer 2014We added two more location into the mix (for a total of three) and found that we'd grown to 21 students! 

Winter 2014Cassie partners with Brooklyn based songwriter, Jo Solomon. The merger lands Cassie with amazing songs to develop the early childhood music and creative play program she's been dreaming about for years. It also gives us a sister, Stomp and Shout Brooklyn. 
Summer 2015 Holy smokes -- 38 enrollments, 3 teachers, 3 locations, and 2 guitarists. 
Winter 2015Our Early Childhood neighborhoods grow to include: Logan Square (the OG), Roscoe Village, Bucktown, West Loop, and Oak Park. 
Stomp and Shout Chicago spearheads it's first program for older kids, Strong Girls Make Stuff at Rivendell Theatre Ensemble. 
    Big Things On The Horizon
 You can see we've been growing in a big, beautiful way! Even more amazing opportunities have been flying Stomp 
and Shout's way and we've found ourselves in one of those exciting moments: there's a need and an opportunity for growth, but all of that growth needs capital to support it. That's where you come in....


The Launch of Stomp and Shout KidsWe've been slowly rolling out a brand new music and creative play program for kids ages 8 months - 4 years. By Spring of 2016 we'll have added a Manhattan location, an Iowa location, and many, many families. We've got BIG DREAMS for this unique program. Your investment will help facilitate: 


Recording & Sound Design for our original poems & short stories 

Design, Writing, Research, Printing of Take Home Materials 
An Illustrator for our Play Packets, Poems, and Stories 

The nitty gritty: a lawyer for trademarking, partnership agreements, and licensing. 

Spreading the word: A fancy-schmancy PR person to alert the masses to the brilliance of Stomp and Shout 



Stomp and Shout HQ located in Logan Square The time has come for us to plant our roots. Where to do it was a no brainer -- beautiful Logan Square! Not only will Stomp and Shout HQ provide a space for our classes, trainings, and a much needed office for Cassie, it will also open up opportunities for us to throw parties, produce inventive, immersive children's theatre and family friendly concerts  (what up kindie rock!), and offer space to other family/kid focused companies (think: birthing classes, mama groups, dance classes, instrumental music lessons, and more!). Don't worry -- we'll continue to offer our classes all over the city of Chicago!! 




The Perks
With your investment, you're putting your Stomp and Shout Kid at the center of the 
program. We're all parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles, cousins, babysitters, and/or besties to tiny tots. The kids that we love deserve to shine 
-- and this is the opportunity for it!""Become A Stomp And Shout Kid"" Perks:

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hi!</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>I'm Carrone Conroy, founder of Elite Mentoring and you can get a hold of me at Carrone@elitementoring.co, I am looking forward to hearing from you. </div> <p>Education is something I have always been passionate about. After teaching for several years, working hard to complete my MBA and with my social entrepreneurship background I believe I am in an awesome position to really add value to this amazing industry. </p>
<p>I am trying to raise money for Elite Mentoring to launch a peer-2-peer mentoring based education (or learning) platform. Elite Mentoring is wanting to carve a place in the adult and professional education industry as well as the traditional education industry. Starting with a simple website and online platform and growing from there. </p>
<p>After working in the education system for several years I couldn't help but notice the inefficiencies. Being as passionate and committed to education as I am, I know I can help make a change for the better. </p>
<p>With a little bit of help from you we will be able to put together all the different parts that make a online platform like this work. And with a little bit of luck we will be able to start building the future of education, artificial intelligent learning programs, videos and chat bots to really start building individual learning programs for all.  </p>
<p>Your contribution, in anyway, shape or form would mean the world to me. </p>
<p>I just want to thank you for taking the time to even check out this campaign. It really does mean the world to me, so thanks! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am a big believer in dreaming big! The target of $100,000 I will admit, does seem a little ambitious. With this level of backing I will be able to hire world class programmers, developers and designers to help get this platform absolutely humming! And if there was enough money so I could work on Elite Mentoring full-time, well that would be a dream come true. </p>
<p>I haven't got the exact details of how much it is going to cost but I know it is going to be a lot. This campaign is really about raising enough money to get a world class website up and running as well as promoting the website and mentoring programs. </p>
<p>Now, honestly, the perks are the perks, but if you want anything done, and I mean anything at all, to thank you for your contribution just get in touch and let me know. </p>
<p>The most exciting perk is the mentoring program, which is really like a pre-sale of our actual product. Where you will be matched up with one of your mentors for our Elite 12 month Mentoring Program at a fraction of the cost. </p>
<p>These coaching programs are specific and tailored to the individuals needs. The programs involve catching up with your mentor as often as once a week, with 24 hour access via chat applications and email. A 12 month coaching program with this much access to a mentor would traditionally cost in the thousands. I am confident with the intelligent use of technology it can be done for a fraction of the cost. </p>
<p>Now I know giving money away online to a complete stranger is risky, but with my hand on my heart, I can say I am in this for all the right reasons and if you can help in anyway I will be truly grateful. I mean over the moon and back grateful. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Changing the world is something our generation believes in intuitively. The problem is how do we change the world? The best answer to this question I have heard is ""find a problem and then solve it."" Now the world has one less problem in it. </div>
<div>Education is the problem I want to fix, and your contribution will go along way to helping me do that. </div>
<div>Education should be all about bringing forth what is within, lighting a fire inside of people. Not filling people's heads with ""knowledge"" and then testing the life out of them. This is exactly what I want to change. </div>
<div>Yes, starting something from scratch or changing anything is hard, and changing something as big and complicated as education will be super duper hard.

I had so many questions and concerns about the labor and delivery- bordering on neurotic. Yet she was thorough and very informative. I could tell that she had a lot of experience as a doula because she was calm and knowledgable in our meetings before the delivery. She was also readily available over the phone, and email and in person to talk to me whenever I needed. During the delivery she was sensitive to my needs – whether I needed space or more comfort. Right after my daughter was born she made sure the nurses gave us skin to skin contact which was something I told her was important to me."" - Daniella G. (from the video!)

<span>Hello, my name is Rajiv Patnaik, and I am the founder of Zedbridge. </span>
</div>
<div>
<p>Zedbridge began in early 2013 after the passing of my father Zachariah Patnaik, who was the president of HCS Elementary.  <b>Zedbridge - “The Zachariah Education Bridge” </b>was founded in <b>honor of my father Zachariah</b>.  It's purpose was to bridge the education gap between the privileged and underprivileged.  </p>
<p>My father, Zachariah, having very humble beginnings, <b>personally experienced</b> how <b>quality education </b>could<b> ignite</b> a <b>child's dreams</b> and desires. He also witnessed how easily those same dreams and desires could be extinguished when a child is engulfed in poverty and does not have access to quality education.  </p>
<p><span><span><span><span>My father dedicated over 27 years of his life serving underprivileged children through HCS in Kolkata, India.  He passed away in February 2013 when I took over the school.  It is an honor to follow in my father's footsteps and a privilege to be part of such a potentially powerful institution.  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I am where I am in life because of the quality education that my father received through his early years.  If if hadn't been for the people who invested in him at a young age, he would not have had access to quality education and I could have been born into poverty and been part of the 250 million illiterate students!  So it is with much gratitude and a privilege to play a part in the story of each children's lives that I lead this organization.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>With the privilege comes a huge responsibility. The parents of our students sacrifice more than you and I can ever imagine to enable their children to attend school, because they believe education is the ticket out of poverty.  This lays on me the responsibility to provide space where all these children are allowed the basic right to dream and then are given the tools to pursue their dreams. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>

<div>This has been a challenge for us to create given our lack of resources and qualified teachers.   Zcloudschool, our education model was born out of these limitations and the fact that there are many more schools like us that can't afford the traditional resources to provide quality education.  We had to <b>THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX</b> to develop a model that <b>provides quality education</b> at an <b>affordable cost. </b>
</div>
<div>
<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">There is yet another level of schools, where </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">teachers</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> are </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">equipped</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> to </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">fail.

These are the schools around the world that produce the 250 million illiterate students!  There is absolutely no reason for these statistics when educational resources are free and plenty.  This injustice is what drives me to spend the rest of my life to create change. </span>

<p>The Zcloudschool solution provides an entire pre-packaged school (PreK - 8th grade) in the cloud with all the main elements that make up a great school:</p>The Zcloudschool alternative educational solution combines traditional teaching and a low-cost technology center to provide an innovative learning environment. The traditional teaching approach follows education standards and uses printed detailed lesson plans following best teaching methods. Classes are taught locally but are monitored and administered remotely. The low-cost technology center follows the Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE). Classes are taught and monitored remotely through the Internet via live or recorded instruction.</div>

This includes developing a full year of dynamic and interactive lesson plans for an elementary school (PreK - 8th Grade).<br/><br/>We will initially follow the ICSE (Indian Council of Standard Education) education standard for the curriculum.  This is one of the main education standards in India. <br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This team will work with our teachers at our school in India to develop and test these lesson plans with our students. This campaign is to raise funds to pay salaries of this team for six months.  </span><br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will incorporate these lesson plans into our school and will start evaluating the program at this point to see how it is functioning.  </span><br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The team will then develop the curriculum and instructional material for the innovative teaching. </span><br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our plan is to develop this model within the first 18 months and then replicate it at 5 other schools in Kolkata, India within 2 years of us starting this process.  Once we have seen success, we will take it to other cities in India and then the rest of the world. </span><br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our plan is also to develop a model that allows for a level of sustainability, where we can charge for it and offer it free of cost to schools that cannot afford it.</span><br/> </div>

<p>We’ve put together an exciting set of perks around our mission.  Our perk names come from animals found in India!</p>
<p><b>Every dollar you give will not only support quality education for the 280 underprivileged students at our school but will have an exponential return, once we start replicating at other schools in India and the rest of the world. </b></p>
<p>These perks are set up to raise $60,000 for the initial phase of this model to be implemented.  This will also help us to develop  six  months of curriculum/lesson plans for an elementary school. </p>

Statistics show that over 250 million students globally can’t read, write, or count. There are also 1.2 million students that drop out of school in the US every year.  Additionally, 25% of teachers (1.7 million) in India don’t attend classes the entire year.  Zedbridge's mission is to leverage technology to equip unresourced schools and teachers with a high quality education program that allows students to discover and achieve their full potential.  Unlike other solutions, we provide a comprehensive global solution (An entire school in the box) that contains all the components (instructional, training, administrative tools, and a support structure) required to run an Elementary school (pre K - eighth grade).  Also, unlike other solutions that rely mainly on autonomous learning, we understand the importance of working with existing educational infrastructures and having a teacher as a mentor and guide in these children's lives.   The Zedbridge global educational solution empowers almost anyone to teach utilizing the best teaching practices and employs curricula that follows education standards and develops the entire child.  Additionally the program is easily deployable, customizable, scalable, and has a support structure that enables teachers to succeed.  We realize that we can NEVER replace a qualified and experienced teacher but our hope is that through this education model we can exponentially improve the teaching of these un-resourced teachers.  
 Zedbridge was born out of a need to provide affordable high quality education for the underprivileged students of HCS Elementary school in Kolkata, India.  
Over the last two and a half years we have been informally developing and testing select components of the Zedbridge program at HCS and we have seen a dramatic improvement in student grades and teacher motivation.  We are now at a stage where we are ready to develop a complete pre-packaged program that we can try at HCS and then replicate to other schools in India and around the World.

 


“We are striving to transform education for the underprivileged from the chains that bind the poor in the cycle of poverty to be the most powerful tool used to change the world,” Rajiv Patnaik.Our extensive experience working with HCS has provided us with considerable insight into the problems and needs of un-resourced schools that serve underprivileged children.  We also have a team of qualified administrators and educators  who excel at providing quality education. 
We believe that this educational solution can change the world -- or as Steve Jobs said “make a dent in the Universe”-- because of its simplicity, its support structure, its low cost, and its easy replication.  It is our goal to narrow the education gap between the privileged and the underprivileged.This campaign will raise funds for the a team of 12 qualified and experienced teachers to develop 6 months of curriculum and lesson plans for an entire Elementary school (Pre K - 8th Grade) in India.

Hello, my name is Rajiv Patnaik, and I am the founder of Zedbridge. 


Zedbridge began in early 2013 after the passing of my father Zachariah Patnaik, who was the president of HCS Elementary.  Zedbridge - “The Zachariah Education Bridge” was founded in honor of my father Zachariah.  It's purpose was to bridge the education gap between the privileged and underprivileged.  
My father, Zachariah, having very humble beginnings, personally experienced how quality education could ignite a child's dreams and desires. He also witnessed how easily those same dreams and desires could be extinguished when a child is engulfed in poverty and does not have access to quality education.  
My father dedicated over 27 years of his life serving underprivileged children through HCS in Kolkata, India.  He passed away in February 2013 when I took over the school.  It is an honor to follow in my father's footsteps and a privilege to be part of such a potentially powerful institution.  
I am where I am in life because of the quality education that my father received through his early years.  If if hadn't been for the people who invested in him at a young age, he would not have had access to quality education and I could have been born into poverty and been part of the 250 million illiterate students!  So it is with much gratitude and a privilege to play a part in the story of each children's lives that I lead this organization.
With the privilege comes a huge responsibility. The parents of our students sacrifice more than you and I can ever imagine to enable their children to attend school, because they believe education is the ticket out of poverty.  This lays on me the responsibility to provide space where all these children are allowed the basic right to dream and then are given the tools to pursue their dreams. 
 

This has been a challenge for us to create given our lack of resources and qualified teachers.   Zcloudschool, our education model was born out of these limitations and the fact that there are many more schools like us that can't afford the traditional resources to provide quality education.  We had to THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX to develop a model that provides quality education at an affordable cost. 


There is yet another level of schools, where teachers are equipped to fail. They have lost the motivation to teach effectively due to a lack of training and support .  These are the schools that employ the 1.7 million teachers in India that don't attend any classes the entire year! These are the schools around the world that produce the 250 million illiterate students!  There is absolutely no reason for these statistics when educational resources are free and plenty.  This injustice is what drives me to spend the rest of my life to create change. 


We have a unique and amazing opportunity with HCS Elementary.  It's our sandbox, our testing ground!  We have complete freedom to develop our model at a live school and test it without limitations.  If successful, it can be replicated in other schools in India and then around the world. 


Thank you for taking the time to read our story.  Please join us in this walk.  We cannot do this on our own.

You can help by contributing what you can and by joining our movement.
 

 
 
                                   
 
Our mission is to develop a model that makes quality education a universal opportunity made possible through our passionate and global team of partners, volunteers, and supporters.Zedbridge is predominantly a volunteer-driven and grassroots effort. Many talented and diverse individuals from all over the world have contributed their abilities and passions to finding solutions to help make quality education more equally accessible.      
 
                                                      
 



 
 
 

 
Our solution is to equip these under resource and unmotivated teachers with resources that a qualified teacher would have.  We believe that we can inspire these teachers if we can equip them properly and show them how to reach and positively influence their students.
The Zcloudschool solution provides an entire pre-packaged school (PreK - 8th grade) in the cloud with all the main elements that make up a great school:The Zcloudschool alternative educational solution combines traditional teaching and a low-cost technology center to provide an innovative learning environment. The traditional teaching approach follows education standards and uses printed detailed lesson plans following best teaching methods. Classes are taught locally but are monitored and administered remotely. The low-cost technology center follows the Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE). Classes are taught and monitored remotely through the Internet via live or recorded instruction.

                                  
 
Our next step is to employ a team of local, experienced and qualified teachers in India as well as a team of experienced teachers here in the US to develop the traditional teaching approach of our model. This includes developing a full year of dynamic and interactive lesson plans for an elementary school (PreK - 8th Grade).We will initially follow the ICSE (Indian Council of Standard Education) education standard for the curriculum.  This is one of the main education standards in India. This team will work with our teachers at our school in India to develop and test these lesson plans with our students. This campaign is to raise funds to pay salaries of this team for six months.  We will incorporate these lesson plans into our school and will start evaluating the program at this point to see how it is functioning.  The team will then develop the curriculum and instructional material for the innovative teaching. Our plan is to develop this model within the first 18 months and then replicate it at 5 other schools in Kolkata, India within 2 years of us starting this process.  Once we have seen success, we will take it to other cities in India and then the rest of the world. Our plan is also to develop a model that allows for a level of sustainability, where we can charge for it and offer it free of cost to schools that cannot afford it. 

                                     



Imagine a world where every child has access to schools that have motivated and driven teachers who are excited to impart quality education; have the opportunity to grow and prosper, and where technology, and knowledge are open to them, to help them achieve their full potential.  
Without reading, writing, and arithmetic skills, this world is closed to them. Books...the Internet...Wikipedia...wider education...all of this needs to be unlocked with literacy.

We are creating a movement, a global community of organizations and individuals that will sustain and build up this education model.  If you are interested in joining our team or know anyone that would be interested in this, please let us know.  We want you to be part of this movement and to put your brick in the wall in allowing these children to achieve their full potential. 
We also have a great range of perks that allow you to objectively lay your brick in this wall.  As you can imagine a project this large is going to cost a lot.  We are going to shoestring this project to get us initially started and do this project in modules based on the funding that we receive.  
 
                                     
                                      
We’ve put together an exciting set of perks around our mission.  Our perk names come from animals found in India!
Every dollar you give will not only support quality education for the 280 underprivileged students at our school but will have an exponential return, once we start replicating at other schools in India and the rest of the world. 
These perks are set up to raise $60,000 for the initial phase of this model to be implemented.  This will also help us to develop  six  months of curriculum/lesson plans for an elementary school.

The school has been very gracious in hosting our workshops. It's equipped with classrooms, office, a library, kitchen, bathrooms, a dormitory with toilets and showers, and a bore hole. A bore hole, also known as a ""water well"" was installed in November 2012.  It is 90 feet deep and provides clean drinking and cooking water for the students and staff at the school.  Unfortunately, the solar powered pump that brings up clean water is not operating. Once the solar pump is repaired, clean water will be restored for approximately 1,500 people!  Prior to the installation of the bore hole students and local villagers were getting water from the Ewaso Nyiro River. The river is very unclean and inhabited by crocodiles that catch, kill and mame people. The river is also a source of water for elephants, lions, baboons, hippos, and other wild animals who live in and around Samburu National Reserve. It's simply unacceptable that people must risk their lives while getting water.  We're in contact with the initial installers of the bore hole and solar powered panel and our goal is to have the repairs completed by November, 2015.<br/><br/><div>

</div></div>","Pastoralist Child Foundation conducts educational workshops at Lorubae Primary School in Archer's Post, Samburu County, Kenya. The school has been very gracious in hosting our workshops. It's equipped with classrooms, office, a library, kitchen, bathrooms, a dormitory with toilets and showers, and a bore hole. A bore hole, also known as a ""water well"" was installed in November 2012.  It is 90 feet deep and provides clean drinking and cooking water for the students and staff at the school.  Unfortunately, the solar powered pump that brings up clean water is not operating. Once the solar pump is repaired, clean water will be restored for approximately 1,500 people!  Prior to the installation of the bore hole students and local villagers were getting water from the Ewaso Nyiro River. The river is very unclean and inhabited by crocodiles that catch, kill and mame people. The river is also a source of water for elephants, lions, baboons, hippos, and other wild animals who live in and around Samburu National Reserve. It's simply unacceptable that people must risk their lives while getting water.  We're in contact with the initial installers of the bore hole and solar powered panel and our goal is to have the repairs completed by November, 2015.
The beauty of the bore hole is that not only do the 350 students and 10 teachers and administration at Lorubae Primary School get clean drinking and cooking water, but approximately 1,200 nearby villagers do too!! What We Need:  
 


1.  one c200 pump control unit 



2.  one float switch unit           



3.  one cable tie

4.  labor charge $2,000 will cover the entire cost of repairing the solar powered pump.




                                            The underside of the solar panelOnce the pump is repaired there will no longer be a need to purchase water for the school or our educational workshops. The bore hole provides plenty of water for everyone. The solar panel is welded into the tower and protected by a fence to prevent theft.  Pastoralist Child Foundation has recently been invited to become a United Nations endorsed Green Hub. This means that we will eventually teach agricultural farming to the students and local villagers in Archer's Post. But first...let's all chip in and get the water back! Imagine the happy faces of children once the water starts flowing up the well again!     Students are taught health & sanitation.  Clean hands are a good thing!                                             Local villagers filling up their water buckets
                                 Villagers transporting clean drinking and cooking water.                                         Is it time for Chai?  YUM!!                             You can make this girl and many other people healthier and                  happier by contributing to this campaign. Water is life! All the above pictures are courtesy of www.zoewaters.org. Pastoralist Child Foundation received permission to post pictures from the installation of the bore hole at Lorubae Primary School in Archer's Post, Samburu County, Kenya.

</h3>
<div>
<p>The Interdisciplinary Studio for Learning and Design (ISLAND) is a community created to promote innovation across diverse disciplines through workshops and design projects for the Binghamton University Community. We are a group of seventeen engineering students, who began meeting last fall, that share a common desire to revamp and revitalize the way we learn at school.</p>
<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
</div>
<p>We create and advise design teams to encourage students to learn practical and project management skills by designing and building a device, either for a competition or for a local client, for the community or university. Projects are one of the best ways to learn, and by providing projects for students, we hope to supplement and enhance traditional classroom learning.</p>
<p>We also host workshops for students, teaching requested skills for classes, design projects, or just for fun. Experienced students meet in the weeks before a workshop, come up with demos and activities, and split up during sessions to help working students. We believe that this hands on learning, outside of the classroom, makes better students and, ultimately, professionals.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What Do We Need?</h3>
<div>
<p>We’ve already hosted one workshop on Arduino microcontrollers focusing on their ability to interface with biosensors and another workshop on the R programming language using resources we have on hand. Additionally, we have a design team competing in the EMedic Global design competition, plus a team working with a client from the local Binghamton area to design a unique communication device for a child with autism.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in order to put on different types of workshops and help design teams prototype their ideas, we need to purchase electronics, materials, and tools. As a group comprised of students, we suffer a lack of funds that stunts our ability to teach students and limits the selection of skills we can pass on to other students. If we cannot provide materials for an idea, the idea cannot be explored.</p>
</div>
<h3>What Do We Do With the Funding?</h3>
<div><p>Your support would go toward the purchasing of materials for our workshops and  design teams. These include microcontrollers, sensors, wires, tools, and other components to use as teaching aides. The increased capacity to purchase supplies would expand both the size of workshops we could host and the variety of skills that can be taught during any one session.This funding would also include the purchase of materials such as wood, plastic, metal alloys and more for our design teams to build prototypes of their devices. </p></div>

Yet most people have never heard of the milk banking service.</p><p>Milk banks work like the blood transfusion service - donors are carefully screened and milk is checked and heat-treated to ensure it is safe. The milk is then sent to hospitals to feed fragile premature babies in their first few days of life when enough of their own mother's milk is not available. This is a common situation, as their mothers are often ill themselves or too traumatised by watching their babies fight for life to express milk immediately.</p><p>We need your help. There is a widening gap in the NHS for the provision of donor breast milk, especially in London and the southeast. The Hearts Milk Bank can close that gap, and meet the need from doctors outside of the neonatal unit to access donor milk for their patients.</p><p>We currently have a waiting list of women who would love to donate their milk, and we have hospitals across London waiting to receive it. We now need your support to help save tiny babies’ lives. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p>I'm an Oxford-trained doctor and breast cancer researcher at Imperial College - through my work I started to collaborate with Gillian Weaver, an internationally recognised milk banking expert with almost 30 years of experience. </p><p>Working so closely with Gillian, I became aware of how important milk banks are. I also saw the increasing pressures on the existing milk banks, which have meant that many hospitals are currently unable to access donor milk, or milk is being rationed to only the very sickest babies. Milk bank staff across the region are working so hard, but still cannot meet the demand.</p><p>Gillian and I are therefore now working around the clock to establish the Hearts Milk Bank - a social enterprise non-profit organisation that aims to fill the gaps in provision.</p><p>We are now at the stage where we have premises at the University of Hertfordshire, volunteer couriers (the fantastic SERV Blood Bikers) who will pick up and deliver milk on their motorbikes, and a network of lactation consultants ready to start our Expresso Clubs - community groups where women can come together to learn about donating their milk and be recruited and supported as donors. And have some fantastic decaf coffee too!</p><p>Now, we just need your help.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need</strong></p><p>We need £50,000 to purchase the specialist equipment to make sure the milk is processed safely.</p><p>If we can raise the money through crowdfunding, we will be able to access other funds to train a specialised lactation consultant specifically to work with mothers who have lost their babies. There is currently minimal lactation support available for mothers in this situation, we aim to help mothers with their milk. </p><p> </p><p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The Impact</strong></p><p>Around 70,000 babies in the UK are born prematurely each year. According to the latest data, donor milk reduces the risk of babies developing necrotising enterocolitis, a gut condition that can be fatal in up to 40% of affected children, by 75%.</p><p>Silke Durm, the mother of two very premature children who received donor milk, says: “The Hearts Milk Bank will play a vital role in securing safe donor milk for all premature babies that need it. It will ensure that these vulnerable babies receive the best possible care, giving parents the peace of mind to know that they have done everything medically and physically possible to ensure that their baby has the best chance of survival.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you can’t donate money, then there are plenty of other ways that you can help:</p><ul>
<li>Ask your friends to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the Hearts Milk Bank all over social media.</li>
<li>Listen to the podcasts when they are released on crowdcaster.com (Hearts_Milk_Bank) and share as widely as you can! We will post an update when the first goes live.</li>

We now need your support to help save tiny babies’ lives.  Who are we?I'm an Oxford-trained doctor and breast cancer researcher at Imperial College - through my work I started to collaborate with Gillian Weaver, an internationally recognised milk banking expert with almost 30 years of experience. Working so closely with Gillian, I became aware of how important milk banks are. I also saw the increasing pressures on the existing milk banks, which have meant that many hospitals are currently unable to access donor milk, or milk is being rationed to only the very sickest babies. Milk bank staff across the region are working so hard, but still cannot meet the demand.Gillian and I are therefore now working around the clock to establish the Hearts Milk Bank - a social enterprise non-profit organisation that aims to fill the gaps in provision.We are now at the stage where we have premises at the University of Hertfordshire, volunteer couriers (the fantastic SERV Blood Bikers) who will pick up and deliver milk on their motorbikes, and a network of lactation consultants ready to start our Expresso Clubs - community groups where women can come together to learn about donating their milk and be recruited and supported as donors. And have some fantastic decaf coffee too!Now, we just need your help. What We NeedWe need £50,000 to purchase the specialist equipment to make sure the milk is processed safely.If we can raise the money through crowdfunding, we will be able to access other funds to train a specialised lactation consultant specifically to work with mothers who have lost their babies. There is currently minimal lactation support available for mothers in this situation, we aim to help mothers with their milk.  The ImpactAround 70,000 babies in the UK are born prematurely each year. According to the latest data, donor milk reduces the risk of babies developing necrotising enterocolitis, a gut condition that can be fatal in up to 40% of affected children, by 75%.Silke Durm, the mother of two very premature children who received donor milk, says: “The Hearts Milk Bank will play a vital role in securing safe donor milk for all premature babies that need it. It will ensure that these vulnerable babies receive the best possible care, giving parents the peace of mind to know that they have done everything medically and physically possible to ensure that their baby has the best chance of survival.” Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t donate money, then there are plenty of other ways that you can help:
Ask your friends to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.
Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the Hearts Milk Bank all over social media.
Listen to the podcasts when they are released on crowdcaster.com (Hearts_Milk_Bank) and share as widely as you can! We will post an update when the first goes live.
Consider becoming a milk donor if you are currently breastfeeding.
If you live nearby, contact us to discuss becoming a volunteer to the milk bank.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>I’ve been in the industry for over 20 years illustrating and writing multicultural children’s books and talking about the importance of relevant reflection. <strong>As a parent it is <u>STILL</u> challenging to find enough relevant reflection for my kids of color. As a 2nd generation queer family, it is nearly impossible.</strong> And I know we are not alone.</p>
<p>This is why I want to jumpstart a mass publishing at my independent press with at least 6 new titles for 2017. I want to invest in serious change right now for myself, my family and my communities.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476133976/aurabdbgg4g7ieja1fdn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Reflection Press and School of the Free Mind (the indie press and online school I cofounded) focus on ALL 3Rs of children’s books as a radical act</strong>—<i>Reflection, Reclamation and Regeneration</i>— and center People of Color, Indigenous and Queer voices and experiences.</p>
<p>Independently publishing my own picture books is an empowering experience, but my books do not exist in isolation. <strong>My voice is stronger in the company of other POC, Indigenous and Queer voices coming into power alongside mine. </strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">By supporting these 6 new titles that push the bounds of children's books you are also supporting the continuing development of our online courses, materials, and programs for aspiring children's book creators, kids and families.</h3>
