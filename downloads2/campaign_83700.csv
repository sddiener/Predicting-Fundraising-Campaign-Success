<p><b>KEEP LIVE JAZZ IN HARLEM – SAVE CASSANDRA’S
JAZZ!</b></p>
<p><b>Goal:  <span>$95,000</span></b></p>
<p>Cassandra’s JAZZ Club &amp; Gallery’s primary Mission is
to:  KEEP “REAL” JAZZ ALIVE IN HARLEM, correcting
the ongoing misrepresentation and misconception of Jazz, protect its legacy and
preserve the historical significance of Jazz and its relationship to Harlem -- the hallowed grounds of Jazz.   This is the vision and long  dream of two of millions of people: Dr. Dwight Dickerson, and wife Cassandra<b>. 
Through persistence, preservation and sheer determination, Dr. Dwight --
“Doc” -- and Cassandra have made their DREAM A REALITY - this is their story! </b> </p><p></p><p><b>A Bit About the Campaigners:</b></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dr. L. Dwight Dickerson</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is a professor of music (Ph.D., UCLA, 1998) and a life-long, self-appointed “Ambassador of Jazz.""  Doc has dedicated his life to teaching, playing and promoting JAZZ – real Jazz and its history – around the world.  He is a passionate, internationally known, Master Jazz pianist, bandleader and composer, with over 60 years of professional performance experience with “Jazz Giants” worldwide.   As a professor, Dr. Dwight most recently taught at the American University of Sharjah (Dubai) where he designed and implemented the first music curriculum on the university level in the Middle East. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cassandra Storey-Dickerson</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> – After whom the Club was named – is a Legal professional, administrator and promoter. In 2003, while living abroad for 13 years, started “Divas Abroad"",  where she managed, promoted and booked American women Jazz singers in upscale venues throughout Asia and the Middle East. She was a co-producer of “SummerStage Dubai” (2005-2009)  and also planned, promoted and implemented the only successful Jazz Supper Club -- complete with the introduction of Western “soul food” -- to the Middle Eastern culture. </span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p><p>After an arduous and exasperating year spent negotiating the rigors of the New York State liquor licensing process, and many exhausting negotiations on the exorbitant and prohibitive pricing of New York real estate, in late summer 2015, the courageous couple “softly” opened Cassandra’s Jazz Club &amp; Gallery! The mission was accomplished; the vision fulfilled. Cassandra and Doc repatriated back to New York after living
abroad for 13 years, armed with their Faith, Doc’s own Fazioli Grand Piano and
the couple’s <b>life savings!</b>  </p><p>In
2013, they commenced to find, recreate and open <b>CASSANDRA’S JAZZ CLUB &amp; GALLERY,</b> literally in the heart of the
“Hallowed Grounds” of Jazz in Harlem. 
Before becoming Cassandra’s, the venue was<span> a dark, fearful and violent place that stigmatized and
embarrassed the Community, ultimately 
resulting in the loss of a young man’s life in 2014. Today, it is a
beautiful, art-filled, culturally rich, proud and happy place  where “real”,  live,  straight-ahead JAZZ
emanates from the bandstand, throughout the brick walls lined with portraits of
the “Jazz Legends” – past and present.  As many local and international
“Jazz Lovers” have exclaimed, Cassandra’s is currently the most elegant venue
Uptown, delivering the best live, authentic Jazz – the quintessential American
art form – that Harlem has witnessed since the “Swing Era”!</span></p><p>But, unfortunately, due to the <b>extraordinarily high rents </b>in the newly “gentrified” Harlem, social engineering and
corporate greed - <b><i><u>$8,000
per month for Cassandra’s</u></i></b>
–<b>Cassandra’s JAZZ Club &amp; Gallery is in<span> IMMINENT DANGER OF CLOSING!  Cassandra’s is now on the same course </span></b>that has led most of the legendary jazz clubs of Harlem <b>down the path of imminent doom – <i>Lenox Lounge, Small’s Paradise, Count
Basie’s, Wells, on &amp; on.</i>  Due to
the high rents, Cassandra’s is on the brink of closing only six months after
its “soft” opening, even before the Jazz community has  discovered
Cassandra’s existence!</b></p><p><b>A Bit
About The Venue</b></p>
<p>Transforming
the old  venue (formerly known as “PJ’s”)  from a “dive bar” with a long history of criminal acts -- one  resulting in tragic death in January 2014 (referenced above) -- to Cassandra’s
Jazz – a place where  people in the Community are not afraid to enter or
gather, was in itself no easy or inexpensive task.  Pictures of the old “PJ’s” BEFORE
Cassandra’s are attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>“Since 2010, PJ’s Cocktail Lounge and
Restaurant had been the scene of four separate shootings, a stabbing, an
assault, a gunpoint robbery and an attack on two police officers, according to
NYPD records…. <span><a href=""http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140108/central-harlem/man-shot-killed-harlem-bar-fight-nypd-says"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The fourth
shooting took place Jan. 8</a>, 2013</span> when a 33-year-old patron was tragically
gunned down, losing his life.  In late
January 2014, the premises were ordered shuttered by the Manhattan Supreme
Court – for the third time since 2009. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A Bit about the Landlord</b></p>
<p>The Landlord’s premature and
precipitous push to take back Cassandra’s Jazz, considering its contribution to
the community and increase in the property value for the Landlord, is untimely and
suspect. </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>In the beginning of the long-negotiated venture, the Landlord,
and as new owners of multiple buildings in Harlem, first presented itself as a
supporter of Jazz.  The concept and
possibilities of a high-end, law-abiding Jazz club,  as a step in erasing the dark stigma and
negative repute of the old  ""PJ's"", appeared  timely
and financially appealing, especially, when the ""Landlord does
no work"" clause was firmly embedded in the Lease.  Cassandra's was
renovated from bottom to top with Doc and Cassandra's own life savings.  The
rental payments began in January.  </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>The Landlord gave three months rent concessions; however,
Cassandra's was barred by law to open and operate without the SLA liquor
license approval, which did not come until six months' later, or, June 2015.
 </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Further, there was  a month's delay due to heating failure,
which took the full month of February - the coldest month of last year - to
repair so the hourly paid contractors could resume work. </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>With no income to pay exorbitant $7800 per month rental,  together with the multiples of other
expenditures of  required for a start-up business, has led to an
exhaustion of their funds.  Thus, unfortunately, Cassandra's fell into
arrears.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>It has now come to the attention of Doc and Cassandra that the
Landlord's suspicious and sudden push to regain control and possession of
Cassandra's,  that a broker of an
anonymous mega foreign corporation -- with unlimited funds -- has tremendous
interest in acquiring the space Cassandra's has now unilaterally renovated and now
occupies.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>This is occurring after only six months – and during the period
when Cassandra’s is beginning to make the turn toward sustainability.</p>
<p><b>· This is also indicative of what is currently
happening in Harlem, in New York City, in Washington, DC and in many major cities
across the US.  </b></p>
<p>· Inasmuch as Music – Jazz  – is the
ultimate cultural unifier,<b> it is not</b> the diversity of people of Harlem seeking
better lives,<b> it is the take-over of the faceless, multi-national and foreign
corporations, politicians, laws and lawyers and that aid the Landlords for
their own self-serving greed that reeks havoc among communities by jacking up rents to usurious  unaffordable prices that has driven multiple generations of Harlemites from their homestead.   </b></p><p><b>· </b>Clearly,
<b>It’s all about money! </b> It is money and
the greed has driven many small businesses – especially music venues – and
mostly uptown Jazz clubs -- into shutdown. 
<b>Most recently, the<i> Lenox Lounge</i>, which rents were tripled by its
Landlord resulting in subsequent long-fought court battles and, ultimately, destruction.  Now, historically, it is now one more
statistic in many historic Harlem Jazz clubs… gone by the wayside.</b></p>
<p> <b>· </b>Since Cassandra’s  only defense is to pay the arrearages eliminating the Landlord’s only reason to evict Cassandra’s from the premises that houses it.
Doc and Cassandra cannot do it alone, which is why they are asking you to step
in and stand with them!  </p><p><b><b>· </b>This Campaign is a grassroots effort of compassion and love for the music -- a small step toward saving  the culture, the history and the legends of Jazz.  The politicians and banks won't help except to lead us down the same path as the other legendary Jazz clubs mentioned above.  Only WE can do this -- WE MUST KEEP CASSANDRA’S JAZZ open!</b><br/></p><p><b>· </b>As professionals and business people, Cassandra and Dr. Dwight understand that the “rent must be paid”; <b>but, for right now, our sword in this battle is money -- and we are losing the battle.  </b></p><p><b><b>· </b>Regardless of the Landlord's motivation, the laws are on its side.  Therefore, to allow Cassandra's to not only “Keep<i> real </i>Jazz Alive in Harlem - “Save Cassandra’s Jazz”, but also advance their vision beyond Harlem and  Cassandra's, Cassandra's must pay the money -- and it needs your help!<br/></b></p>
<p>Together – Lovers of Jazz and music in
general world-wide, historians, musicians, community activists, etc. -- with
small, large or ANY contribution to this Campaign – you can help Doc and
Cassandra – with whatever your finances will allow – to not only “Keep<i> real </i>Jazz Alive in Harlem - “Save Cassandra’s Jazz” but also to advance their vision to “Keep<i> real </i>Jazz Alive"" worldwide.</p>
<p></p><p><b>Cassandra's JAZZ Deserves To Be Harlem</b></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The transformation of Cassandra’s from a dark and
violent place to a place presenting “culture, class and cool JAZZ,” this
process  </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">deserves some concessions… and
more time for many reasons, but especially since:</b><br/></p>
<p>(a)<span>  </span>Cassandra’s has all but erased the fearful and painful imagery
of the old PJ’s, <b>and replaced it with </b>a social outlet in which patrons can feel proud,  and
safely enjoy world-class Jazz<b>.  </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>(b)<span>  </span><b>Cassandra’s
is 
contributing both culturally and scholastically to the Community by raising the standards of the music  – the ultimate unifier of all cultures. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>(c)<span>  </span>New “young,
up and coming” residents of the Harlem Community of all races and demographics  are now coming in for the first time.  “Old-timers” of Harlem Jazz thrilled to have a place to
go as they had  ""back in the day!""   As the
word spreads of Cassandra’s existence – as if they’ve discovered an “oasis in
the desert”, people are coming!  </p><p><b>(d)  Since Cassandra’s in the only “jazz club” providing <i>real </i>“live” Jazz six nights a
week – Doc and Cassandra are  lauded  with
praises and thank you’s NIGHTLY for making Cassandra’s Jazz happen in their
Community!</b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> THE PLAN</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Doc and Cassandra have not
only  ""come this far by Faith,"" and belief in the Music – the ultimate unifier –
but also through a well thought-out 10-year plan.  </b></p><p><b><b>The Plan is simple: To STAY and continue to provide the Jazz community with the highest quality of Jazz, performed by world class Jazz Legends at discounted prices. </b></b></p><p><b>During their quest to find a home for
Cassandra’s, the couple was advised by numerous financial “experts” that
opening a Jazz club in Central Harlem would cost well over $1M.  Doc and Cassandra defied that logic by
diligently and determinedly finding the venue, restoring and opening it with a
budget of under $400,000 – their own money, their life’s savings!  But now – TO STAY and GROW – Cassandra’s needs
help.  It needs a “one shot” cash
infusion of $95,000 to “keep the dream alive” and “keep the music playing!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The monies raised will

KEEP LIVE JAZZ IN HARLEM – SAVE CASSANDRA’S
JAZZ!
Goal:  $95,000
Cassandra’s JAZZ Club & Gallery’s primary Mission is
to:  KEEP “REAL” JAZZ ALIVE IN HARLEM, correcting
the ongoing misrepresentation and misconception of Jazz, protect its legacy and
preserve the historical significance of Jazz and its relationship to Harlem -- the hallowed grounds of Jazz.   This is the vision and long  dream of two of millions of people: Dr. Dwight Dickerson, and wife Cassandra. 
Through persistence, preservation and sheer determination, Dr. Dwight --
“Doc” -- and Cassandra have made their DREAM A REALITY - this is their story!  A Bit About the Campaigners:

Dr. L. Dwight Dickerson is a professor of music (Ph.D., UCLA, 1998) and a life-long, self-appointed “Ambassador of Jazz.""  Doc has dedicated his life to teaching, playing and promoting JAZZ – real Jazz and its history – around the world.  He is a passionate, internationally known, Master Jazz pianist, bandleader and composer, with over 60 years of professional performance experience with “Jazz Giants” worldwide.   As a professor, Dr. Dwight most recently taught at the American University of Sharjah (Dubai) where he designed and implemented the first music curriculum on the university level in the Middle East. 


Cassandra Storey-Dickerson – After whom the Club was named – is a Legal professional, administrator and promoter. In 2003, while living abroad for 13 years, started “Divas Abroad"",  where she managed, promoted and booked American women Jazz singers in upscale venues throughout Asia and the Middle East. She was a co-producer of “SummerStage Dubai” (2005-2009)  and also planned, promoted and implemented the only successful Jazz Supper Club -- complete with the introduction of Western “soul food” -- to the Middle Eastern culture. 


OverviewAfter an arduous and exasperating year spent negotiating the rigors of the New York State liquor licensing process, and many exhausting negotiations on the exorbitant and prohibitive pricing of New York real estate, in late summer 2015, the courageous couple “softly” opened Cassandra’s Jazz Club & Gallery! The mission was accomplished; the vision fulfilled. Cassandra and Doc repatriated back to New York after living
abroad for 13 years, armed with their Faith, Doc’s own Fazioli Grand Piano and
the couple’s life savings!  In
2013, they commenced to find, recreate and open CASSANDRA’S JAZZ CLUB & GALLERY, literally in the heart of the
“Hallowed Grounds” of Jazz in Harlem. 
Before becoming Cassandra’s, the venue was a dark, fearful and violent place that stigmatized and
embarrassed the Community, ultimately 
resulting in the loss of a young man’s life in 2014. Today, it is a
beautiful, art-filled, culturally rich, proud and happy place  where “real”,  live,  straight-ahead JAZZ
emanates from the bandstand, throughout the brick walls lined with portraits of
the “Jazz Legends” – past and present.  As many local and international
“Jazz Lovers” have exclaimed, Cassandra’s is currently the most elegant venue
Uptown, delivering the best live, authentic Jazz – the quintessential American
art form – that Harlem has witnessed since the “Swing Era”!But, unfortunately, due to the extraordinarily high rents in the newly “gentrified” Harlem, social engineering and
corporate greed - $8,000
per month for Cassandra’s
–Cassandra’s JAZZ Club & Gallery is in IMMINENT DANGER OF CLOSING!  Cassandra’s is now on the same course that has led most of the legendary jazz clubs of Harlem down the path of imminent doom – Lenox Lounge, Small’s Paradise, Count
Basie’s, Wells, on & on.  Due to
the high rents, Cassandra’s is on the brink of closing only six months after
its “soft” opening, even before the Jazz community has  discovered
Cassandra’s existence!A Bit
About The Venue
Transforming
the old  venue (formerly known as “PJ’s”)  from a “dive bar” with a long history of criminal acts -- one  resulting in tragic death in January 2014 (referenced above) -- to Cassandra’s
Jazz – a place where  people in the Community are not afraid to enter or
gather, was in itself no easy or inexpensive task.  Pictures of the old “PJ’s” BEFORE
Cassandra’s are attached.


“Since 2010, PJ’s Cocktail Lounge and
Restaurant had been the scene of four separate shootings, a stabbing, an
assault, a gunpoint robbery and an attack on two police officers, according to
NYPD records…. The fourth
shooting took place Jan. 8, 2013 when a 33-year-old patron was tragically
gunned down, losing his life.  In late
January 2014, the premises were ordered shuttered by the Manhattan Supreme
Court – for the third time since 2009. 













A Bit about the Landlord
The Landlord’s premature and
precipitous push to take back Cassandra’s Jazz, considering its contribution to
the community and increase in the property value for the Landlord, is untimely and
suspect. 
·  In the beginning of the long-negotiated venture, the Landlord,
and as new owners of multiple buildings in Harlem, first presented itself as a
supporter of Jazz.  The concept and
possibilities of a high-end, law-abiding Jazz club,  as a step in erasing the dark stigma and
negative repute of the old  ""PJ's"", appeared  timely
and financially appealing, especially, when the ""Landlord does
no work"" clause was firmly embedded in the Lease.  Cassandra's was
renovated from bottom to top with Doc and Cassandra's own life savings.  The
rental payments began in January.  
·  The Landlord gave three months rent concessions; however,
Cassandra's was barred by law to open and operate without the SLA liquor
license approval, which did not come until six months' later, or, June 2015.
 
·  Further, there was  a month's delay due to heating failure,
which took the full month of February - the coldest month of last year - to
repair so the hourly paid contractors could resume work. 
·  With no income to pay exorbitant $7800 per month rental,  together with the multiples of other
expenditures of  required for a start-up business, has led to an
exhaustion of their funds.  Thus, unfortunately, Cassandra's fell into
arrears.
·  It has now come to the attention of Doc and Cassandra that the
Landlord's suspicious and sudden push to regain control and possession of
Cassandra's,  that a broker of an
anonymous mega foreign corporation -- with unlimited funds -- has tremendous
interest in acquiring the space Cassandra's has now unilaterally renovated and now
occupies.
·  This is occurring after only six months – and during the period
when Cassandra’s is beginning to make the turn toward sustainability.
· This is also indicative of what is currently
happening in Harlem, in New York City, in Washington, DC and in many major cities
across the US.  
· Inasmuch as Music – Jazz  – is the
ultimate cultural unifier, it is not the diversity of people of Harlem seeking
better lives, it is the take-over of the faceless, multi-national and foreign
corporations, politicians, laws and lawyers and that aid the Landlords for
their own self-serving greed that reeks havoc among communities by jacking up rents to usurious  unaffordable prices that has driven multiple generations of Harlemites from their homestead.   · Clearly,
It’s all about money!  It is money and
the greed has driven many small businesses – especially music venues – and
mostly uptown Jazz clubs -- into shutdown. 
Most recently, the Lenox Lounge, which rents were tripled by its
Landlord resulting in subsequent long-fought court battles and, ultimately, destruction.  Now, historically, it is now one more
statistic in many historic Harlem Jazz clubs… gone by the wayside.
 · Since Cassandra’s  only defense is to pay the arrearages eliminating the Landlord’s only reason to evict Cassandra’s from the premises that houses it.
Doc and Cassandra cannot do it alone, which is why they are asking you to step
in and stand with them!  · This Campaign is a grassroots effort of compassion and love for the music -- a small step toward saving  the culture, the history and the legends of Jazz.  The politicians and banks won't help except to lead us down the same path as the other legendary Jazz clubs mentioned above.  Only WE can do this -- WE MUST KEEP CASSANDRA’S JAZZ open!· As professionals and business people, Cassandra and Dr. Dwight understand that the “rent must be paid”; but, for right now, our sword in this battle is money -- and we are losing the battle.  · Regardless of the Landlord's motivation, the laws are on its side.  Therefore, to allow Cassandra's to not only “Keep real Jazz Alive in Harlem - “Save Cassandra’s Jazz”, but also advance their vision beyond Harlem and  Cassandra's, Cassandra's must pay the money -- and it needs your help!
Together – Lovers of Jazz and music in
general world-wide, historians, musicians, community activists, etc. -- with
small, large or ANY contribution to this Campaign – you can help Doc and
Cassandra – with whatever your finances will allow – to not only “Keep real Jazz Alive in Harlem - “Save Cassandra’s Jazz” but also to advance their vision to “Keep real Jazz Alive"" worldwide.
Cassandra's JAZZ Deserves To Be HarlemThe transformation of Cassandra’s from a dark and
violent place to a place presenting “culture, class and cool JAZZ,” this
process  deserves some concessions… and
more time for many reasons, but especially since:
(a)  Cassandra’s has all but erased the fearful and painful imagery
of the old PJ’s, and replaced it with a social outlet in which patrons can feel proud,  and
safely enjoy world-class Jazz.  

(b)  Cassandra’s
is 
contributing both culturally and scholastically to the Community by raising the standards of the music  – the ultimate unifier of all cultures. 

(c)  New “young,
up and coming” residents of the Harlem Community of all races and demographics  are now coming in for the first time.  “Old-timers” of Harlem Jazz thrilled to have a place to
go as they had  ""back in the day!""   As the
word spreads of Cassandra’s existence – as if they’ve discovered an “oasis in
the desert”, people are coming!  (d)  Since Cassandra’s in the only “jazz club” providing real “live” Jazz six nights a
week – Doc and Cassandra are  lauded  with
praises and thank you’s NIGHTLY for making Cassandra’s Jazz happen in their
Community!
 THE PLAN

Doc and Cassandra have not
only  ""come this far by Faith,"" and belief in the Music – the ultimate unifier –
but also through a well thought-out 10-year plan.  The Plan is simple: To STAY and continue to provide the Jazz community with the highest quality of Jazz, performed by world class Jazz Legends at discounted prices. During their quest to find a home for
Cassandra’s, the couple was advised by numerous financial “experts” that
opening a Jazz club in Central Harlem would cost well over $1M.  Doc and Cassandra defied that logic by
diligently and determinedly finding the venue, restoring and opening it with a
budget of under $400,000 – their own money, their life’s savings!  But now – TO STAY and GROW – Cassandra’s needs
help.  It needs a “one shot” cash
infusion of $95,000 to “keep the dream alive” and “keep the music playing!

The monies raised will
be used to:(a) 
  Add signage and
electrical access to the front exterior;(b) 
 Add plumbing for running water to the food
service area (kitchen) to increase sales;
(c) 
 Hire and train staff; and, most importantly,
(d) 
 Cure rental arrearages to put Cassandra's JAZZ on a level playing field.FUTURE PROJECTIONSEven in its short existence, based on the standards of Jazz being presented at Cassandra’s, not only is the local community discovering the “oasis” within it, but also through social and print media, tourist advertising,  as well as the never-failing “word of mouth”.   Cassandra’s is now being compared with the “Top 5” New York Jazz Clubs  and “buzzed” about on the international Jazz circuit as the new “go to” place for Jazz in NYC!· Cassandra’s  has attracted the attention of many reputable Jazz organizations, such as the Wilbur Ware Institute.(Fundraiser, November 13-15, 2015); Jazz Foundation of America, and many other institutions supporting Jazz.· World class Jazz artists  such as Ron Carter, Louis Hayes, Patience Higgins, Geri Allen, James Carter, Michael Carvin, Eddie Henderson, Gary Bartz – to name a few -- have either visited, performed or scheduled upcoming performances at Cassandra’s. · Future income projections, by certified accountants,  range from $$15,000 - $20,000 per month – to pay the $8k monthly rent, musicians, staff and expenses.  This will be achieved by presenting two to three Major Jazz Headliners  per month -- the likes of Eddie Henderson coming  or Gary Biarritz - together with a nightly line-up of local Live Jazz bands and cultural presentations,  pulled from the vast pool of talented, and skilled musicians in the New York area.************************This is only the beginning for Cassandra’s JAZZ!  Upon moving past this  impasse’, the future projections are bright and bountiful.  Cassandra’s will not only enhance the economic viability of the Community by creating job opportunities for musicians and others alike, but also aid in returning Harlem to its rightful and proud place as one of the Jazz Capitals of the World.  Help Us “Keep The Music Playing”As Jazz afficiados, musicians, historians, Harlemites,  and Jazz Lovers across the globe, we cannot allow this to happen!  We must stand together to protect jazz – its history and its Legends -- in Harlem and worldwide.  We appreciate and accept any and all pledges from $10 to $10M!  Select the ""Perk"" or add any amount you can afford that will help us ""keep the music playing"" at Cassandra's JAZZ!YES WE

Heroes Never Die 

Some people become famous or make six-figures, others
never see life outside of minimum wages or constant turmoil. Regardless of where
people may find themselves in life, they have a unique ability, the ability to be
someone’s Hero. Everyone loves watching a good hero's story unfold, the trials, the failures, and ultimately the victory that seemed impossible to reach. Although though these heroes will eventually die their legacies will live on... 
HND is a collection of music I teamed up with
Grammy award winning producer Alex ""Big Juice"" Hitchens to create. Juice has produced some of our favorite songs for artist such as Lecrae, This'l, MC Jin, and many more. He was also the producer the music for Kobe Bryant and Lebron Jame's latest Nike commercials.  The Idea was to infuse my love for superheroes and Hip Hop and create an epic story. Along with this collection of music, I began drawing a graphic novel that I hope to release in the near future.    What We Need & What You Get My team and I need: 


Composition/Beats($2,000>>potentially open ended)
Mixing & Mastering ($900)
Recording ($540)
Graphic Design($900)
Touring ($1,500)
Marketing(Open ended)

<h2>If you don't think Beethoven and Brahms are hilarious, you haven't experienced the Mozart Musical Workout! </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>HELLO AND WELCOME! You are enthusiastically invited to support the shooting and editing of the Mozart Musical Workout, a series of exercise videos that work out the whole body and foster a love for classical music at the same time. Adding exhilarating fun to any elementary school classroom, the movements are humorous, stimulating and  exhausting -- perfect for a 3-minute movement break in the general classroom and as an entertaining exploration of classical pieces in the music classroom.</p>
<p>We have planned 10 videos that focus on grades 1 through 6 and can also be enjoyed by people of all ages. Each segment includes carefully choreographed patterns of movement that emerge from the core essence of the music. The students develop a connection and sensitivity to the music, while developing critical listening skills. STUDENTS WILL LAUGH AND GIGGLE with Mozart and Tchaikovsky, then take away a deeper understanding of each piece, no longer a bunch of random sounds. With repetition and follow-up lessons, students develop the ability to differentiate emotional and musical characteristics within each piece, such as dynamics, sequence, key changes, patterns, structure, melodic and rhythmic contours, and the spirit of the music -- all embodied through rigorous, funny, kinesthetic engagement.</p>
<h3>JOIN US. BRING CLASSICAL MUSIC TO LIFE FOR A NEW GENERATION,</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">AND GET THEM IN SHAPE!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Mozart Musical Workout comes with</p>
<p>• the workout!</p>
<p>• tutoring videos that teach the workout movements</p>
<p>• lesson ideas for each piece of music plus information about the composers and their place in history and geography.</p>
<p>Besides functioning as a powerful educational tool in the music classroom, the series is also great for movement breaks during a day of rigorous instruction!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The funds we raise will pay for producing, shooting, and editing the videos for 10 pieces of music. This includes casting, rehearsing, rental of equipment, green screen special effects, sound studio rental, costume design, post production editing, and obtaining rights to use each piece.</p>
<p>In addition, personal appearances and hands on workshops promoting the video will be utilized for marketing.</p>
<p>Your contribution will enable children all over the world to jump and twirl to Mozart and Brahms, kick, shake, hop and zombie-out to Beethoven. [The gift of joy is priceless. ]</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is wonderful to see children laugh and smile while learning about classical music. Your contribution will enable our project to spread around the world.

<h3>Clint Alphin</h3>
<p>I moved to Nashville, TN from North Carolina in 2003 to finish an internship for a degree from Appalachian State University and pursue a career as a songwriter and performing artist. In the past 15 years, I've released three independently produced albums and gained recognition from several different prominent songwriter and artist contests, most notably as the winner of the 2017 Telluride Troubadour contest at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. In the pursuit of my music, like plenty of other people, I've held several day jobs to support my art, including loading trucks for FedEx, tuning snow skis, working at music stores, and around 10 years of substitute teaching and part-time teaching in public schools. I took a break from teaching a little over two years ago to pursue music full-time, and I've been fortunate to see increased musical success since then.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Goal</strong></h3>
<p>As I've worked and learned the process of making records, I've learned it's a lot like any project in a conventional business - finding and hiring the right people is crucial. I've learned from several of my friends who have been finding success as full-time independently touring musicians that using professional PR can make a huge difference in reaching new fans and booking festivals and venues that have good reputations and pay well. I've found a PR firm in Nashville that I think is a good fit for me, and I'm excited about working with them for this new album release.  </p>
<p>Professional promotions can cost almost as much as recording and producing the album, so I'm asking for some funding help, like many of my other musician friends have. This is not an easy thing for me to do, and it's a scary amount of money for me to ask for as well. But Indiegogo lets me keep whatever I raise, so you can be sure that whether I reach or surpass the $10,000 goal I've set, whatever money I can raise through this campaign will be much appreciated and put to good use.</p>
<p>By helping me in this campaign, you are helping me get my music to a national and possibly worldwide audience; you are helping me get reviews from music critics in reputable publications; and you are helping me continue to live my dream of writing songs and performing them for people (like you) who love the music and stories of singer/songwriters (like me) who travel the roads catching songs and sharing their heart with others through music.  </p>
<p>Thank you for being an important part of this journey with me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Costs and Benefits</h3>
<p>I've tried to keep my perks and rewards on this campaign as straightforward as possible. My purpose is to get my record out to the world and to be able to play in front of more audiences for more shows each year. So the rewards are based around getting you my new music and giving you the opportunity to come to Nashville to hear it live or bring me to your hometown to play for you in person. </p>
<p>As far as the costs go, hiring the PR firm will cost me around $3,000 per month for a four-month rollout campaign. The PR staff will send out the album and press materials to publications, music reviewers, and radio stations that they have built reputations with. This doesn't guarantee getting good or well-published reviews, but it gives me a better chance of getting the attention of those people than if I were to send them the music myself. Those of you who are good at math will realize I need $2,000 more than what I'm asking for. If I happen to raise that extra $2K, that would be great, but the goal I've set helps me get started and get most of the way through the campaign. That's a big deal, and I'll be more than grateful for whatever funds you help me raise.</p>
<p>If I should raise more than the amount I need, the extra funds will go either to extended months of PR, hiring a separate and dedicated radio promoter to send the music to terrestrial folk and Americana radio stations, and/or securing a venue and band for the official album release show next year in Nashville. I'll also be planning to produce and release music videos for some of the songs during 2019, so some funds could go into the production costs associated with those. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I said before, there is no guarantee that I will get lots of good reviews and good radio play out of the money that I'm spending. But I'm proud of the new music I've created; it's as good or better than anything I've recorded in the past; and the people I'm hiring are as excited about the potential this music has to reach and move people as I am. I'm also confident that whatever increased presence I'm able to achieve through this promotional campaign will be progress in my goal to have a sustainable life making quality music, and just making the connections to more fans through the fulfilling of the perks of this campaign (especially the house concerts) will be a big step forward for me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thanks for reading about my funding goals and efforts. I realize that some folks may not be able to contribute at this time or to give as much as they would like. If that's you, I completely understand and would be happy to have you help me in other ways.</p>

Fans of dark music appreciate the contrast between memorable cold female voice and a colorful male death metal growls, and also mix of heavy guitar riffs with exquisite keyboards (classic of the genre), symphonic arrangements and the general atmosphere of the songs. We take our inspiration in different mythologies, legends, history of ancient civilizations, mysticism and philosophy, which is reflected in English texts-paintings, painted in deep colors.</p><p>The first time we met with the platform Indigogo in 2016, when we raised funds for the recording of our second album, <strong>""Tessellation of the Universe""</strong>. Our campaign was more than successful, and thanks to your funds we released a wonderful album! It was a great experience, and we learned about our fans around the whole world. You can check the previous campaign here: <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sanctorium-s-new-album--2/x/14305506#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sanctorium-s-new-album--2/x/14305506#/</a></p><p>Since then we shot and released a new video <strong>""Kaleidoscope""</strong> for a song from TotU, became the finalists of <strong>Emergenza</strong> (international music competition), went to <strong>Japan</strong> twice and played there 3 shows, went on a tour of the <strong>Balkans</strong> and played 8 shows in<strong> Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary </strong>and<strong> Slovakia</strong>, played 2 concerts in <strong>Finland</strong> and of course in<strong> Saint Petersburg</strong>. And after it we are still full of energy and ready to present to you something special ;) And for those, who didn't listen to our music yet, you can do it here: <a href=""http://sanctorium.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sanctorium.bandcamp.com/</a></p><p>Metal music and Sanctorium means a lot for us. Since 2005 when we started with our first members and up till now, it’s the big part of our lives. Receiving your support on the concerts and internet is one of the best things in this business we are engaged in! THANK YOU! Without you, our work would have been useless.</p><p>Now it’s time for our next step. We prepared a really huge thing! Our new album will be called <u><strong>""Ornaments""</strong></u> and consists of a 2 parts: symphonic metal and symphonic folk metal. So it will be a double album from 16 tracks, including 2 instrumentals, with epic arrangements, live academic choir, deep texts and interesting and complex musical parties, as always. We cannot make it just ourselves, so we ask you for help!</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Recording a huge symphonic metal album is a difficult task now. It is actually probably the most expensive metal genre to work in. We've done a lot of hard work, but a lot of things are yet to come! We decided to make mixing and mastering of the album in Europe, so the cost of this campaign will be much higher than last time :( Because of a lot of tracks, 12 000$ is the minimal sum of money we need to record this album. This is the money to pay for studio time, sound engineer, artwork, merch and perks to you.</p><p>In return we offer you the best perks we could think of, which include the digital and physical versions of the album (plus very limited special edition), various merch (special limited edition), some cool pastimes like joining us in Saint Petersburg, and so on.</p><p><u>Note: EVERY PERK INCLUDES SHIPPING TO ANY COUNTRY!</u></p><h3>Budget</h3><p>It’s always cool to know where exactly your money goes. So here it comes:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Studio time</strong> (90 hours) – 1 600 $</li>
<li>
<strong>Sound engineer’s fees </strong>(mixing, mastering) – 8 000 $</li>
<li>
<strong>Artwork</strong> - 300 $</li>
<li>
<strong>Merch</strong> - 600 $</li>

We are Sanctorium - the Russian symphonic metal band.And again, let us introduce ourselves! Fans of dark music appreciate the contrast between memorable cold female voice and a colorful male death metal growls, and also mix of heavy guitar riffs with exquisite keyboards (classic of the genre), symphonic arrangements and the general atmosphere of the songs. We take our inspiration in different mythologies, legends, history of ancient civilizations, mysticism and philosophy, which is reflected in English texts-paintings, painted in deep colors.The first time we met with the platform Indigogo in 2016, when we raised funds for the recording of our second album, ""Tessellation of the Universe"". Our campaign was more than successful, and thanks to your funds we released a wonderful album! It was a great experience, and we learned about our fans around the whole world. You can check the previous campaign here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sanctorium-s-new-album--2/x/14305506#/Since then we shot and released a new video ""Kaleidoscope"" for a song from TotU, became the finalists of Emergenza (international music competition), went to Japan twice and played there 3 shows, went on a tour of the Balkans and played 8 shows in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, played 2 concerts in Finland and of course in Saint Petersburg. And after it we are still full of energy and ready to present to you something special ;) And for those, who didn't listen to our music yet, you can do it here: http://sanctorium.bandcamp.com/Metal music and Sanctorium means a lot for us. Since 2005 when we started with our first members and up till now, it’s the big part of our lives. Receiving your support on the concerts and internet is one of the best things in this business we are engaged in! THANK YOU! Without you, our work would have been useless.Now it’s time for our next step. We prepared a really huge thing! Our new album will be called ""Ornaments"" and consists of a 2 parts: symphonic metal and symphonic folk metal. So it will be a double album from 16 tracks, including 2 instrumentals, with epic arrangements, live academic choir, deep texts and interesting and complex musical parties, as always. We cannot make it just ourselves, so we ask you for help!What We Need & What You GetRecording a huge symphonic metal album is a difficult task now. It is actually probably the most expensive metal genre to work in. We've done a lot of hard work, but a lot of things are yet to come! We decided to make mixing and mastering of the album in Europe, so the cost of this campaign will be much higher than last time :( Because of a lot of tracks, 12 000$ is the minimal sum of money we need to record this album. This is the money to pay for studio time, sound engineer, artwork, merch and perks to you.In return we offer you the best perks we could think of, which include the digital and physical versions of the album (plus very limited special edition), various merch (special limited edition), some cool pastimes like joining us in Saint Petersburg, and so on.Note: EVERY PERK INCLUDES SHIPPING TO ANY COUNTRY!BudgetIt’s always cool to know where exactly your money goes. So here it comes:

Studio time (90 hours) – 1 600 $

Sound engineer’s fees (mixing, mastering) – 8 000 $

Artwork - 300 $

Merch - 600 $
Subtotal – 10 500 $
IndieGoGo fees (5% + 5% new fee ""Reserved Funds"" + approx 4% for transferring money = approx 14% +25$) - approx 1 500 $Total – 12 000 $What Happens if We Raise Less?If we raise less than 12 000 $, the album will be made anyway and we will fulfill all our obligations to those who back us up. But of course it will take longer since we will have to do non-musical jobs to earn some of the money ourselves and borrow the rest of it.What Happens if We Raise More?If we manage to raise more than 12 000 $, we will shoot a new wonderful video for the one of a new song.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you would still like to help but don't have funds, you can help us by telling all of your friends that this campaign is running.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>You're Never Truly Lost When You Are</h2><h2>""At Home At Sea""</h2><p>My name is E.G. Phillips.  I'm a singer-songwriter based out of San Francisco.  I write jazz-infused indie-folk music with lyrics that have been described as both cinematic and whimsical.  I've recently completed a new full length album which I'll be releasing in early 2019 which I've dubbed ""At Home At Sea.""  I'm offering it for pre-sale to mitigate all the costs involved in an admittedly ambitious plan that includes creating two music videos.</p><p> </p><h3>About The Album</h3><p>The album includes songs that I've been playing live at venues around the Bay Area for the past few years.  They have proved to be popular with audiences and I'm really excited about the the results of my collaboration with Ben Osheroff who recorded and produced the album. </p><p>As befits my own musical tastes, it's a rather bohemian menagerie.  In addition to the jazzier numbers that make up the majority of the album, there's also a bossa nova tune, a rock epic, and a haunting soundscape.  The instrumentation is eclectic and varied — with a steel guitar, trumpets, baritone saxes, trombones, mandolins, violins, and even ukuleles all joining the fray at various points.</p><p>These are songs about dealing with and managing loneliness, longing and heartache.  They are all tunes I love and they've helped me many a day get through what Douglas Adams once described as that ""Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul"" and other moments of lowness.   Performing a rousing rendition of ""The Albatross Song"" and getting audiences singing along at my gig at the Hotel Carlton once a week has been a life saver for me (you get a small taste of this through the opening choral segment actually recorded at a performance at the Lost Church last July).</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrBYudemqUc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>So I'm passionate about these songs and want to give them their best chance to be heard by as many people as possible, as niche as my brand of music may be.  And releasing new music, especially an, is an opportunity to get people's attention and grow as an artist,  I've done what I can to minimize my costs overall, such as doing my own artwork, but ultimately this sort of promotion, along with recording, costs money.   By contributing to this campaign, you'll be helping me spread the word and evangelize this music as well as create some more fun and engaging works of art. </p><p>Specifically, I'm producing music videos to help visualize these songs and get them more exposure through social media.  Additionally I'll be creating physical media to send to radio stations as well as merchandise that I can sell at shows such as t-shirts, magnets and stickers. </p><p>Putting something out there and not having it be noticed at all is one of the most dispiriting aspects of creating anything.  And getting heard above the din of all the noise that's out there is no easy feat, so that's why I'm asking for your help.</p><p>The costs feel overwhelming on an individual level, but with just a little support from you, it will start to seem more doable and that I have some real support for this endeavor and what I've created.  The goal is ambitious, probably a stretch, but just having you throwing something in would mean a lot.</p><p> </p><h3>About Me</h3><p>As Dylan says ""I come from a country called the Midwest"" — though I've been out in the Bay Area for over two decades now.  Still my sensibilities are such that I think there's just something wrong about corn that's not on a cob and not been bought fresh at a roadside stand.  I am in possession of a degree in Geography, I'm a big fan of Doctor Who (it exercises an outsized influence on my oeuvre), and as you might have gathered, I do a bit of painting.    </p><p>As far as music goes, I primarily consider myself to be a songwriter, but I've become much more active as a performer, especially over the past year.  I primarily play live in the Bay Area at venues such as Bazaar Cafe, the Hotel Utah, and the Lost Church, but I've also performed down in Los Angeles and out in Nashville.  I'm quite involved in our local music community here in San Francisco by being a part of our open mic scene and going regularly to our chapter of the musician meet up group ""<a href=""https://www.blncdbrkfst.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Balanced Breakfast</a>.""  I play weekly at the Hotel Carlton as a part of ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/localvocalsSF/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Local Vocals</a>"" and I've volunteered with ""<a href=""https://www.breadandroses.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bread and Roses Presents</a>"" to play for patients at the psych ward of SF General.   I've also organized ensemble events such as tributes to Tom Lehrer and Bob Dylan (some of my musical heroes) — not to mention my own birthday celebration, <a href=""http://www.duckswithpants.com/egphest.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EGPhest</a> — to bring together a diverse set of performers from all the individuals I've gotten to know since I first started actively playing out half a dozen years ago or so.</p><p>I come to all these music related endeavors later in life than is typical, and am really still just getting started.  I only released my first album, ""Fish from the Sky"" just a few years ago, well into my 41st year.  I have had the guitar since college (note I did say I have *played* guitar since college) and until comparatively recently, I mainly dabbled.  I wrote quite a bit that I kept to myself, but I lived a different life before all of this, being something of a refugee from the world of tech these days.  So I'm no musical prodigy by any means, but I bring some lived experience and a life long love for language to my lyrics (early on I was dictating to my parents the words of speech balloons I'd placed in my drawings).  An affinity for classic jazz, British Invasion rock and a wide variety of genres has led me developing my own distinctive palette when it comes to creating melody and harmony. </p><p>You can find out more about myself and my music at <a href=""http://duckswithpants.com""

order to help you understand why I've created a pre-order campaign and what your money is helping to fund, below is a break down of the different components parts and costs I need to cover.  Given that I've previously released an album as well as two singles with videos, I have experience as to what all is involved and where some of the costs come from.   I've chosen flexible funding so I can evaluate where I want to put my resources when the campaign is over.</p><p> </p><h3>

</h3><p>Although physical media is much, much less important these days as a source of profit for artists (who even owns CD player?), there is still a benefit to creating it.  While there is something quite nice about having a physical artifact,  the primarily purpose in this case is for distribution to radio stations, which still prefer that format for maintaining their catalogue.  I will be targeting the distribution of the album to college and independent radio stations. </p><p><img class=""lazy""

using a 4 panel ""digipak"" layout which is a bit no frills, but is lightweight for mailing and also provides a spine with space for the artist name and album title which radio stations require as they tend to store them on shelves like books on a bookcase.  As a line item, this comes to $700.</p><p>Along with the cost of creating the CD, there is also the cost of mailers and postage as well as printing labels and ""one sheets"" on decent quality paper which provide information about myself as an artist.    To be conservative, I'm assuming $3 per mailing for 200 CDs.</p><p>I consider this, along with a nominal amount of money dedicated to ads / boosting posts on social media — which add up and are a necessary evil to get your content seen (even by people who have already ""liked"" you

more ""advanced"" campaign option I am considering, see below).  In addition to purchasing Facebook and Instagram ads to promote these videos, I will be submitting them to various film festivals for which there are not insignificant entry fees and can add up as you select multiple categories — for instance for the Berlin Music Video festival I'm aiming to submit the video for Lighthouse at the

<p>The cost of producing the music videos and doing a social media campaign accounts for over a quarter of the fundraising objective.  The costs are split between the two new videos, with the live action video taking a somewhat larger share of the budget than the animated video.</p>

Phillips.  I'm a singer-songwriter based out of San Francisco.  I write jazz-infused indie-folk music with lyrics that have been described as both cinematic and whimsical.  I've recently completed a new full length album which I'll be releasing in early 2019 which I've dubbed ""At Home At Sea.""  I'm offering it for pre-sale to mitigate all the costs involved in an admittedly ambitious plan that includes creating two music videos. About The AlbumThe album includes songs that I've been playing live at venues around the Bay Area for the past few years.  They have proved to be popular with audiences and I'm really excited about the the results of my collaboration with Ben Osheroff who recorded and produced the album. As befits my own musical tastes, it's a rather bohemian menagerie.  In addition to the jazzier numbers that make up the majority of the album, there's also a bossa nova tune, a rock epic, and a haunting soundscape.  The instrumentation is eclectic and varied — with a steel guitar, trumpets, baritone saxes, trombones, mandolins, violins, and even ukuleles all joining the fray at various points.These are songs about dealing with and managing loneliness, longing and heartache.  They are all tunes I love and they've helped me many a day get through what Douglas Adams once described as that ""Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul"" and other moments of lowness.   Performing a rousing rendition of ""The Albatross Song"" and getting audiences singing along at my gig at the Hotel Carlton once a week has been a life saver for me (you get a small taste of this through the opening choral segment actually recorded at a performance at the Lost Church last July).So I'm passionate about these songs and want to give them their best chance to be heard by as many people as possible, as niche as my brand of music may be.  And releasing new music, especially an, is an opportunity to get people's attention and grow as an artist,  I've done what I can to minimize my costs overall, such as doing my own artwork, but ultimately this sort of promotion, along with recording, costs money.   By contributing to this campaign, you'll be helping me spread the word and evangelize this music as well as create some more fun and engaging works of art. Specifically, I'm producing music videos to help visualize these songs and get them more exposure through social media.  Additionally I'll be creating physical media to send to radio stations as well as merchandise that I can sell at shows such as t-shirts, magnets and stickers. Putting something out there and not having it be noticed at all is one of the most dispiriting aspects of creating anything.  And getting heard above the din of all the noise that's out there is no easy feat, so that's why I'm asking for your help.The costs feel overwhelming on an individual level, but with just a little support from you, it will start to seem more doable and that I have some real support for this endeavor and what I've created.  The goal is ambitious, probably a stretch, but just having you throwing something in would mean a lot. About MeAs Dylan says ""I come from a country called the Midwest"" — though I've been out in the Bay Area for over two decades now.  Still my sensibilities are such that I think there's just something wrong about corn that's not on a cob and not been bought fresh at a roadside stand.  I am in possession of a degree in Geography, I'm a big fan of Doctor Who (it exercises an outsized influence on my oeuvre), and as you might have gathered, I do a bit of painting.    As far as music goes, I primarily consider myself to be a songwriter, but I've become much more active as a performer, especially over the past year.  I primarily play live in the Bay Area at venues such as Bazaar Cafe, the Hotel Utah, and the Lost Church, but I've also performed down in Los Angeles and out in Nashville.  I'm quite involved in our local music community here in San Francisco by being a part of our open mic scene and going regularly to our chapter of the musician meet up group ""Balanced Breakfast.""  I play weekly at the Hotel Carlton as a part of ""Local Vocals"" and I've volunteered with ""Bread and Roses Presents"" to play for patients at the psych ward of SF General.   I've also organized ensemble events such as tributes to Tom Lehrer and Bob Dylan (some of my musical heroes) — not to mention my own birthday celebration, EGPhest — to bring together a diverse set of performers from all the individuals I've gotten to know since I first started actively playing out half a dozen years ago or so.I come to all these music related endeavors later in life than is typical, and am really still just getting started.  I only released my first album, ""Fish from the Sky"" just a few years ago, well into my 41st year.  I have had the guitar since college (note I did say I have *played* guitar since college) and until comparatively recently, I mainly dabbled.  I wrote quite a bit that I kept to myself, but I lived a different life before all of this, being something of a refugee from the world of tech these days.  So I'm no musical prodigy by any means, but I bring some lived experience and a life long love for language to my lyrics (early on I was dictating to my parents the words of speech balloons I'd placed in my drawings).  An affinity for classic jazz, British Invasion rock and a wide variety of genres has led me developing my own distinctive palette when it comes to creating melody and harmony. You can find out more about myself and my music at http://duckswithpants.com — Ducks With Pants being the name of my fake/sometimes real band.  What You're Money Goes TowardsIn order to help you understand why I've created a pre-order campaign and what your money is helping to fund, below is a break down of the different components parts and costs I need to cover.  Given that I've previously released an album as well as two singles with videos, I have experience as to what all is involved and where some of the costs come from.   I've chosen flexible funding so I can evaluate where I want to put my resources when the campaign is over. 
Physical Media Creation and Distribution
Although physical media is much, much less important these days as a source of profit for artists (who even owns CD player?), there is still a benefit to creating it.  While there is something quite nice about having a physical artifact,  the primarily purpose in this case is for distribution to radio stations, which still prefer that format for maintaining their catalogue.  I will be targeting the distribution of the album to college and independent radio stations. I'll be using Disc Makers to create 300 copies of the album using a 4 panel ""digipak"" layout which is a bit no frills, but is lightweight for mailing and also provides a spine with space for the artist name and album title which radio stations require as they tend to store them on shelves like books on a bookcase.  As a line item, this comes to $700.Along with the cost of creating the CD, there is also the cost of mailers and postage as well as printing labels and ""one sheets"" on decent quality paper which provide information about myself as an artist.    To be conservative, I'm assuming $3 per mailing for 200 CDs.I consider this, along with a nominal amount of money dedicated to ads / boosting posts on social media — which add up and are a necessary evil to get your content seen (even by people who have already ""liked"" you ... but don't get me started).  This includes promoting this IndieGoGo campaign.  to be a basic cost to promoting the album and getting the word out.  Overall, this represents about 9% of the overall campaign objective.I'll be offering a limited number of CDs, which I will sign, as a perk.  The rest will be sent to music managers at radio stations across the country. Promotional SwagI'm going to be creating merchandise related to this release that will include t-shirts, magnets and stickers.   These represent a good basic set of merch items that I think people will enjoy and be most likely to buy.  These items will use the artwork and logo I've designed for the album.  I

<p>""During my life as a Korean adoptee and a filmmaker of adoptee documentaries, I've never explored the stories of the women who give up their children hoping for a better life for them, as well as the women like my mother who adopt these children.  What drew me to ""Lap"" is the chance to visually represent these women in the context of an emotional and heartfelt song from two female adoptees.  It is an exciting opportunity and challenge."" -Jon Maxwell</p>

<p><strong>From Musician/Rapper Heesun Lee:</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to write a song which provided an understanding for every person involved in the adoption process.  I felt it was important to let you “see” these unheard stories come alive. After I wrote the rap, I reached out to fellow friend and singer-songwriter, Jacquelyn Wells. Jacquelyn, also a Korean adoptee, wrote the beautiful piano, lyrics, and vocals to the hook and ending of the song, and together we made something we are both extremely proud of. Already the rough draft version has brought many people, adopted and not, to tears. We feel we have something powerful here.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am dedicated, along with Jacquelyn and Jon, to create a video that can change our perception on a topic that deeply affects so many of us. This song dives into issues that are rarely, if ever, discussed in the mainstream media. We need to support artists who are baring their souls in the midst of trying times, because it can help others heal. “Lap” is dedicated towards understanding the vulnerability and humanity in women, no matter what age or color we represent.</p>

</div></div>","SUMMARY
Hi! I am Jen Kerner (performer name Joey Grace). I am a full time special education teacher, but a musician at heart, with the dream to release a full length album, make music videos, and end up on some of the grandest stages in the world, performing with top notch acts!

WHAT I NEED AND WHAT YOU'LL GET
My goal is to raise $15,000 to pay for music video production and studio time. You'll get fun perks by donating!
If I do not reach my goal of $15,000 the money will still be put toward pursuing my dreams with music.

THE IMPACT
After 21 years of working with the special needs community, I am finally focusing on ME and MY dreams in life. I love singing, writing music, and performing live! Your contribution will help me to continue with this dream. I will continue to make content that will be ethereal, beautiful, and interesting to watch and listen to.

THE CHALLENGES
I've already spent my own money to record my EP, create a website, register my songs, and much more. It really adds up after a while! Your contribution will help me to move forward as I pursue music goals.

<p>What is Dark-Pop: its purpose is to finally discuss some tough sometimes traumatizing subject matter in a creepily fun way: pop music. I wanted to give the opportunity to pop listeners to finally feel something real and relatable, the way I felt during the emo wave in the early 2000s. I feel like fans in other genres get to cathartically rage about heavier topics such as suicide, social anxiety, self-deprecation or harm; and their audiences are healthier because of that – they're able to expel this tension from their psyches. That’s what’s so therapeutic about music. Pop tends to be about glamor, happiness, attraction, fun – but you can have fun and still be honest, and that’s why people really resonate with my project. It’s something I’ve been humbled to hear on a number of occasions, that my lyrics are brutal, but the melodies and arrangements are so addicting and fun that people can’t stop singing along and falling in love with the stories being told. An emotionally repressed life is a bird in a cage, and I don’t want to continue that cycle in a craft that’s supposed to set people’s souls free. I want to be the hand unlatching the cage door for everyone.</p>
<p>My name is Ashley Sarah Beroukhim – but I go by Ashley Zarah for short. I’m an odd, redheaded, Iranian-American singer/songwriter and Dark-Pop performer hailing from Los Angeles, CA. I’m a mouthful to say the least. But my toils, triumphs and journey so far has led me here – to Boston, Massachusetts where I’ve been studying and creating at Berklee College of Music. I had quite a hard time figuring out who I am – it’s hard when the world around you seems to reject your will for happiness at every corner (lul*). I mean; bullies, culture and religion, mental illness, romance (lack thereof lol), drugs, anxiety, identity, alcohol (etc.) – the works. And yet there’s always been this music – these voices printed on CDs and singing in headphones telling us that things are getting better, and that we're not toxic by birth but our environments could be – music assured me that I was going to make it out. Music strengthened my optimism, my drive, my ability to see clearer. It strengthened me, and when you’re strong, you can strengthen others. I’m here to prove that no pain is worth the disposal of a life. We’re gonna burns what irks you and dance through the fire of it on stage. But let’s get to that stage.</p>
<p>$3,000 is what it takes to send my music to important bloggers, promoters, influencers, and critics for the rest of the year; it’s what it takes to get me onto Spotify playlists and reach people who don’t know me or don’t have mutual friends with me who see what you share when you hit that share button; $3,000 is gonna add to my music video fund (that I’m so close to reaching already!). I get reviews, features on publications, exposure across the nation. I saw a hilariously embittering comic the other day that we pay everyone for their professions with money, but we pay artists with exposure… it’s a sad truth, but as of now, it’s the truth. So rather than moping over it – we gotta work with it.</p>
<p>I understand what I’m asking for, and that I’m hoping to achieve that year's fund in a mere 60 days – but! I am overcome with gratitude already by any hand that’s reaching to help mine. And whatever we do build together will be sent to this cause, nothing raised will be spent on anything else but marketing this music campaign.</p>
<p>The Ashley Zarah brand stands for unity, stands for empathy, and for patience – patience for others and for ourselves. Proceeds from my merch are sent to suicide prevention programs. I stand beside the SandCloud community as an ambassador for environmental/animal conservation and marine health. Being a musician is not about US; it is about the world that raised us and making sure we take care of it; including all those with a beating heart and a will to live (like you human being things that are reading this). I know my music can do something for people, but if no one hears it, then its function is lost. If a tree falls in an empty forest, right? So let’s make sure that there’s an audience when the music drops.</p>
<p>Thank you all!! Hit me up with any questions or any general feelings/thoughts/comments you may have. Let’s do this ;]</p>

Studying opera and violin-making at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music, and later continuing my studies in Parma, Italy, the language of music continued to reveal itself as the most graceful and expansive way to pour my soul into this world.

Studying opera and violin-making at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music, and later continuing my studies in Parma, Italy, the language of music continued to reveal itself as the most graceful and expansive way to pour my soul into this world. Five years ago when Kundalini yoga and the power of mantra walked into my life, I had a deep knowing in my cells that music truly is medicine.  I am birthing a devotional music album, and I need your support! I truly believe the simplest tools we have… our bodies, our breath, and our voices... are divinely designed to heal our unique selves. Through the study and application of western and eastern sound technology, I have spent over 20 years learning how combinations of movement, breathing patterns, singing, and chanting can rewire our neurotemplates, rewrite our stories, elevate our spirits, and help us embody the change we wish to see.  We have all experienced trauma to some degree within our lives, whether it be our health, within our families, from a natural disaster, or vicariously as a caregiver. Epigenetics shows we carry ancestral trauma from 14 previous generations within our DNA. We store these emotions, experiences, and environments within the cellular memory of our bodies, and need various modalities to self-regulate our nervous systems back to a state of equilibrium. “Life is a challenge, rhythm is the answer.”~ Yogi Bhajan​Our nervous system craves the beat of our mother’s heart, being rocked in our father’s arms, the crashing waves of an ocean, the steadiness of a tribal drum.

<p>Hello friends and fans. My name is <a href=""http://www.kevinjonespercussion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kevin Bujo Jones</a>. I'm a percussionist with a plethora of experience and a veteran of the music industry. I started my career in 1972, at the age of 13 touring with a group signed to All Platinum Records (later Sugar Hill Records). From there I went on to tour and record with Archie Shepp, The Isley Brothers, Whitney Houston and many other icons in the music industry. In 1999 I met pianist and composer <a href=""https://www.kelvinsholarmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kelvin Sholar</a> and we formed a group called Tenth World with a host of young, innovative musicians. Tenth World plays music that can be described as having the melodic and harmonic sensibilities of Jazz and Soul infused with the rhythms of the African Diaspora.  The compositions are a synthesis of our shared experiences and influences. We recorded 3 CD's, 2 of which were picked up by Motema Music. The albums got rave reviews from Jazz Times, Downbeat Magazine and Jazz.com. After a brief period of inactivity we are now back and ready to record again. </p>
<p>This time we are going independent which is great for freedom and creative control. But with that freedom comes the huge cost of making an album. All of the funds we are seeking will go directly to studio time, mixing, mastering, manufacturing, marketing and paying hired musicians that round out the ensemble. </p>
<p>We are calling this effort Tenth World ""Rising"" not just because we are resurrecting our Tenth World project but both Kelvin and I are rising from some severe medical hardships. About five years ago I had to have brain surgery due to a large subdural hematoma. It took me almost a year to even walk without a cane. About a year and a half ago Kelvin passed out on stage in Berlin, Germany and was rushed to the hospital due to a seizure. We are both grateful and humbled to be alive today. The one thing it taught us was that life is short and we value each and every moment. So at this time we feel that we cannot wait for someone or a label to do this for us. We are grabbing our future by reins and steering it in the direction of good.</p>
<p>We want to thank each and every one of you for your kindness, love and support in the past, in the present and in the future. We are making music to uplift people. We are healers because music is the way that we have healed ourselves. </p>
<p>Please help out in whatever way you can. If you can't donate at this time, please share this on your social media platforms and through email. </p>

<h3>We are The High Ground...</h3>
<p>                                          and we're excited to be launching our very first campaign on Indiegogo! For those of you who are not familiar with our story, while on summer break from school in 2017, vocalist Andrew Parker, bassist Matt Brown, and guitarist Jack Brown started the band as three close friends writing classic rock &amp; roll influenced, pop-punk tunes.  We began to perform locally and caught the attention of regulars and music enthusiasts for our catchy hooks, virtuoso instrumentation, and the genuine soul-drenched vocals and charisma of frontman Parker. In late 2017, we entered the studio to record a 4-track mixtape called <i>Concrete</i>. Following the release of the EP, we gained momentum and earned coveted performance slots on the main stage of the annual <strong>Florida Music Festival</strong>, and even the local date of the iconic <strong>Vans Warped Tour</strong>.</p>
<p>We're very proud of our debut EP<i> Concrete,</i> but with the addition of our drummer Dillon Smith, about a hundred live shows under our belts, along with natural maturing, we've grown tremendously since those early days.  Our musicianship and songwriting has advanced and our sound has evolved. Our fan base has exploded and now it's time to show the world what <strong>The High Ground </strong>is capable of, let's rock!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our first and second singles from our upcoming EP (When It Rains, It Pours &amp; Swan Song) have been released, along with music videos for each song. The remaining tracks are fully recorded, produced, mastered, and will be released on September 20th, 2019. </p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to help us raise money toward the recording and production costs we have already invested (which exhausted us a bit financially), as well as to provide additional funds needed to help us properly market and promote the release, and most importantly - continue this whole THG operation. We'll also be making additional upgrades to take our live performances to the next level.</p>
<p>What's the money for specifically? We put some thought into this and came up with a plan:</p>
<p>Recording and Production Costs - 30% of goal</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Tracking, Editing, Tuning, Mixing, and Mastering</i></li>
<li><i>Album art design</i></li>
<li><i>Physical CD Production</i></li>

<li><i>Advertising and Social Media Promotion</i></li>
<li><i>Music videos for at least two songs</i></li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Martina Lynch and I am a Hip Hop and Spoken Word Artist. I have been chasing my dream of changing lives through music since I was 15 years old with little resources. With the help of a local company Taharka Brothers, M.U.A Morgan Elaine, Dewmore Poetry and support from friends and family I was able to tour the east coast. Performing on big stages such as BET'S 106 and park and being selected for two ted talks where I was able to share my poetry and inspire so many!</li>
<li>Now it is time to take it up a notch! I have been able to reach success in my hometown and touch the lives of many through my hip hop and poetry workshops where I work one on one with children who aspire to do poetry. Now I want to take my passion, voice and team nationwide! Music is such a powerful tool when it comes to connecting with people. I believe funding a tour and developing my label will create a great opportunity for so many like me!</li>
<li>You will be helping me to bring a real game changing label into the mainstream. There aren't enough opportunities for artists especially from small towns like Baltimore. If you aren't able to get your music to a major label there's a big chance you will have many hurdles to overcome. With the help of this campaign I will be able to finish what I started and show other independent artist that people really do want change and to see something different.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $15,000! We will be putting $8,000 into travel expenses so that we can be able to travel for a little over two months performing in over 8 cities! We will also put $2,000 into promotion and merchandise. We know to get your voice heard nationwide we will need the promotion and we will need to connect with the fans face to face. Finally we will need $5,000 to build our own studio where independent artists in the area will be able to record.</li>
<li>Whoever donates $5 or more will receive a mix tape from me and a original lip gloss from Morgan. If you donate $10 or more you will receive a shout out on the next album. If you donate 20$ or more you will receive free entry to the next show! </li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal we will work with what we have to make it happen!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are so many artists, poets and musicians trying to find a way to make money doing what they love. I have been working a 9 to 5 job as well as chasing my dream. I recently quit my job to take on music full time. I've decided to take a chance on myself and I really need the support of my peers so that I can launch my label and create opportunities for others! You will be funding one of the greatest labels in the game!</li>
<li>I won the 1st ever adidas open mic series where I was able to have a one on one with HIP HOP legend Pusha T. After hearing my message and my music he says he believes I have the power to change hiphop. I believe I do too and that I can with your help!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Growing up in Baltimore. i have taken advantage of every opportunity that has brought me closer to my dream and even though it has gotten me further it hasn't gotten me where I need to be. Being a Woman in HIP HOP has been an up an down roller coaster for me because even though I'm recognized for my talent, I don't always get the assistance I deserve if I am not over sexualizing myself. I have been told many times that if I were to promote myself as more sexy than I would receive help with promotion and shows. I want to follow my dreams and still be able to be myself. I don't want to wait on a major label or manager to tell me that I'm finally sexy enough or good enough. With your help I want to create that opportunity for myself!</li></ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>

<h3>Our Album</h3>
<p>We're Cardboard Rocketship, a four piece contemporary folk band based in Brooklyn, NY. We've been on quite the journey together so far, having released a five-song EP this past March and a single in July, all the while playing shows in and around NYC. </p>
<p>And now, the time has come to embark on our next and biggest project yet: our debut album.</p>
<p>We're in the process of recording our debut full-length EP, and it's been a wonderfully exciting process. But the fact of the matter is that great records don't come cheap. We've been working with a very talented producer and engineering team in Harlem, NYC, and can't wait to finish the process. But for that, we need your help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're recording twelve songs total. That's a lot of music! We're tracking banjo, guitar, cello, ukulele, and four-part vocals for every song, as well as arranging and adding percussion and piano in many of them. That studio time plus multiple mixes and masters of each song is shaping up to be a 400-hour project for our production team. We want to ensure that we pay them fairly for their time. </p>
<p>When you contribute to our campaign, not only will you help us create a lasting version of our music, but you'll get some perks as well! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any monetary contribution helps so much, but if you're not in a place to donate financially right now, we'd greatly appreciate if you could share this campaign with your community, and follow @cardboardrocketship on Instagram to keep up with our upcoming shows and release info!</p>

<p><strong>Help us finish this album of original songs featuring West African grooves, Latin rhythms, 80's synths, and rock attitude - the first full-length collaboration by Sean Dixon (SLV, Zammutto) and Josh B. Fox (Lamb B. Bear). </strong></p>
<p>We are raising money to finish this record of groove-rich and thoughtful songs about the world we live in now and what it might become. After a year of working on the music, this campaign is raising money for the final stages of the project, including:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Musicians </u>- Including horn players and back-up singers.</li>
<li>
<u>Studio fees</u> - 2-3 days in a studio in New York to record vocals, horns, and other odds and ends.</li>
<li>
<u>Mixing and Mastering</u> - Making the sounds we have captured pop and shine.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Record</h3>
<p>Ten years after making my first album (Lamb B. Bear's <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/680IkIguNx1xYM3PWGe0ym?si=Bv8lrrRATzKmU4m7G4YZUw"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Eat What You Kill</i></a>) in Chicago, I am writing, recording, and releasing my second - a collaboration with oldest friend Sean Dixon, that combines African and Latin rhythms with electronic pop and rock. It's got desert blues, Afrobeat, psychedelic Cumbia, American folk, electronic flash, rock, jazz, and one '80's synth-pop song, naturally. One way or another, it's mostly music to get you dancing first, thinking second.</p>
<p>The first stage began in December 2018, when I spent 8 days in New York City with <a href=""https://www.seandixondrums.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sean Dixon</a>, who has carved out a name for himself working as a professional musician in New York for over 20 years. That first marathon session in New York produced 10 songs, in varying states of completion. Since then, Sean and I have worked remotely, fleshing them out with lyrics and additional arrangements. </p>
<h3>The Songs</h3>
<p>Musically, most of the songs on the album use West African or Latin music as inspiration, ineluctably filtered through my American musical sensibilities. (<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0FluXUBjxKfW1pOfAuSyuj?si=AGIDU9fmQbefrOV51vO7RA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here for a Spotify playlist of ""inspiration"" music.</a>) Sean's tremendous playing and deep experience as a percussionist and bass player in these traditions is at the core of the album's sound. Lyrically, the album reflects some of the major problems of our age, from global warming to income inequality to social isolation, with a central theme at its heart - let's work together. Ultimately, if we do our job right, we will have made a record that is a blast to dance to. </p>
<p>Below are short clips of four of the ten songs, followed by some insights into their genesis:</p>

Josh B. Fox is a Chicago-based musician and writer. He runs the mixtape blog Faux Sounds and works by day as a nonprofit fundraiser. He grew up in Milwaukee in a musical household, playing folk and blues with his parents, Penny and Dave Fox. Their debut recording as a family band, Come Back Baby, will be self-released in January 2020. Credits on this record: Vocals, bass, guitar, keyboards, programing, ukulele, lyrics, composing, arranging, producing.

Sean Dixon is a New York-based composer, producer, drummer, percussionist, and bassist. Also from a musical household in Milwaukee, Sean has lived in New York City since 1994, playing with innumerable performers, including Gotye’s Ondioline Orchestra, Maxwell, Aloe Blaac, Doyle Bramhall II, Amy Helm, Miyamoto Is Black Enough, Andy Akiho, and Helga Davis. He served as the rhythmic backbone of the band Zammuto and co-leads the group SLV. He has studied with Guinea’s master drummer, M’Bemba Bangoura, and Bahia’s musician/capoeirista Mestre Kiki da Bahia and Grupo Ginga.

Famoro Dioubate was born in Conakry, Guinea into a griot family. He is the grandson of El Hadj Djelli Sory Kouyate, a living legend of the Manding balafon. Famoro is a guardian of traditions dating back to the 13th century in the ancient Mandé Empire. He played in several groups across West Africa including Mory Kante‘s orchestra. He lives in New York City, where he leads his band Kakande. Click here to hear his music on Bandcamp.  

Penny Fox is a Milwaukee-based blues and folk singer steeped in traditional American music, with a style all her own. This is her first time singing anything close to music that sounds like this.

<h3>Lofty</h3>
<p>Lofty is an instrumental jazz fusion trio from Eugene, Oregon formed in summer of 2017. Since then, we've played many live shows, but haven't yet been able to release any recordings due to the high cost of studio time. However, the time has come to record a full length album. We're going into the studio in January and have lofty expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to record and mix 12 songs in two weeks - the familiar tracks you know and love, and also a few new ones you haven't heard!</li>
<li>We're featuring a lot of special guests on the album - expect to hear guitar solos, saxophone, and even some mini-orchestral parts!</li>
<li>We plan to capture video throughout the recording process and produce several live videos.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We are designing new art for the album - it will be also featured on the new shirts and posters. We'll post it as an update in a bit, but are still working on it!</p>
<p>If you want a combination of perks that isn't offered, send us a message and we'll work it out or add it as an option! :)</p>
<p>*also there is no way to allow for local pickup as a shipping option, but if you're local and don't need it shipped we're happy to refund the shipping!</p>
</div>
<h3>Cost Breakdown</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 weeks studio time (recording+mixing): $1600</li>
<li>mastering 12 tracks: $600</li>
<li>physical album production: $300</li>
<li>shirt+poster production: $400</li>
<li>album art design: $100</li>
<li>indiegogo and processing fees: $240</li>
</ul>
<p>If our full costs are not met, we do have some flexibility to reduce these costs, for example skimping on mastering or doing a smaller run of shirts/physical CDs. However we hope to meet the full goal and realize the full potential of this album! If we exceed our goal it will allow us to budget a bit for videography and to pay the musicians who have graciously given their time and creative energy to this project!</p>

<h3>Michelle Ingrham</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am a singer songwriter based out of Ocala FL.</li>
<li>I am re-entering the performing singer songwriter world after a hiatus that lasted about 2 years. It's like starting all over again.</li>
<li>I always felt like something was holding me back from achieving, what has always been, my childhood dreams. </li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that I have been given songs to share. They are about my truths, my experiences, and my struggles. One fan says. "" Michelle, I love your songs but some of them are uncomfortable, but we need to hear them."" I believe that too. I believe I'm not alone in how I feel or what I've been through. I want to be a voice, in song, for what needs to be said. One song in particular, is called Beautiful. Low self esteem comes in many forms but it seems to come out in anger and shame when there's a mirror in front of us. Something I have struggled with my entire life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Debut solo CD ""Only Love""</h3>
<p>How you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li> With help from art and music lovers, I will be able to finish this CD, have it duplicated, distribute it to independent and folk radio stations around the world. </li>
<li> When I was in my touring duo, we released 4 CD's, one of which reached #7 on the international folkdj charts, and another #12. They include songs that were accepted into Kerrville folk festival's Newfolk competition and South Florida folk festival's songwriting competition. I will include autographed copies of 1 to all 4 CD's along with a copy of ONLY LOVE. </li>
<li>My goal is to finish this CD, first and foremost. With extra funds I will distribute them to radio stations around the world. You can help me become an international recording artist.</li>
<li>I believe the song "" Beautiful"" needs to be recorded and performed on mainstream radio so I will be trying to push this song toward that and you can say, "" I helped her get this song on the radio"" </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Roadblocks</h3>
<p>I am a massage therapist by day and was taking extra funds like tips, and also online cd sales, and putting that toward this project. I was slowly but surely doing this on my own. It's truly hard to ask for help.  Unfortunately, our landlords have decided to end their marriage and need their beautiful house back. I is a sanctuary for us that holds so many beautiful memories. We thought we would be here for a long time, making more memories. My favorite memory is marrying my best friend in the back yard. That back yard is the scene to the video you are watching.</p>
<p>So now having to move, all those extra funds are now being shifted to saving up to move to another house, in approximately 5 months. </p>
<ul>
<li>This CD holds songs I thought I'd never write. but I did, and they kept coming. I am suppose to share these songs with the people who need to hear them. </li>
<li> I am hoping this CD will reach #10 ( at least ) on the international folk charts, like 2 of our CDs did when I toured with my duo. I am hoping this CD takes me around this beautiful country again. </li>
<li>I believe this is what I'm suppose to do. It's not about making money for me, as a songwriter, it's about the song and the connections they create. It all goes together in an intricate balance of art and finances. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>You never know</h3>
<p>Just like this sudden move we have to make, unwanted challenges occur that we can't avoid. </p>
<ul><li> As a performing singer songwriter, I, for 20 years, performed with my duo, who I was married to, and I became so reliant on him, that I lost confidence in being a strong artist on my own. Doing all the background work, I had the fear instilled in me that music couldn't sustain us because we had a work routine that paralyzed us. His fear was debilitating and I believed it. My biggest challenge is believing is my music, but that confidence is coming back with each performance, each new song, and each encouraging fan that tells me I should be doing this. There is really nothing in the way, other than financially.  I have a supportive husband, family, and fanbase, who believes in me. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I believe there is a reason for everyone who enters our lives. Each person is a lesson in one way or another. Some people don't have funds to help, but they have connections to radio, venues, housing while we are on tour, and even talents to add to this project. I welcome input, ideas, and inspirations. They are all steps to making this project, and my goal, the best they can be. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! </p>
<p>My name is Calvin Limuel. I’m a musician based in Boston, MA. I’m a recent graduate of Berklee College of Music. I began my musical life from my home country Indonesia, and currently for quite some time now in Boston. </p>
<p>Over these years, I have played with so many talented musicians, some of whom I call dear friends, and I have also written so tunes and compositions, but I’ve struggled to compose an actual cohesive album, and I also felt inadequate as a musician. Although it hasn’t really changed that much, I’ve decided that it’s now or never. </p>
<p>This campaign would help me fund my first album project. I have waited for too long, to be able to record my own music, and I’m glad that I can finally do this with some of my good friends, some who I have played with at recitals and many other gigs including our residency at Boston’s legendary Wally’s Café Jazz Club. </p>
<h3>Album Details </h3>
<p>Instead of just one album, I’ve ended up with two setlists for two albums that would be released separately to the public (campaign backers would get them earlier), the first would be titled “Home: In Transit”, and the second one “My Gratitude”. </p>
<p>“Home: In Transit” will contain songs inspired by the places that I’ve lived in, my hometown Jakarta, Indonesia, and Boston, where I’ve lived for almost a quarter of my life now. Many have known me now for one of the songs “Take the T”, inspired by the dreaded MBTA. I’ve considered Boston my second hometown, but I know life will someday lead me out of Boston. “Home” was the initial title of the album I thought of and my bandmates added “In Transit”. </p>
<p>“My Gratitude” will contain songs I wrote as “hommages” toward the great musicians that have come before us and also the people in my life. Songs about, inspired, and for my musical heroes, mentors, and my mother. </p>
<p>These two albums will also include bonus tracks and some exclusive to the campaign backers. </p>
<h3>Your contributions would help us pay for: </h3>
<ul>
<li>the production process (studio recording time, mixing/mastering engineers, additional gears needed);</li>
<li>accommodation (transportation, food);</li>
<li>documentation (photo &amp; video);</li>
<li>graphic designing;</li>
<li>distribution platforms;</li>
<li>marketing &amp; promotional;</li>
<li>and of course, the musicians, engineers, and everybody involved.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><p>In the case that our goal isn’t reached, we are still moving on with the process and hope that we’d still have enough resources (or even more backers) to complete the whole project. </p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You might not be able to contribute monetarily today, but you can still contribute by spreading the news! Use the convenient social sharing buttons on the side, so more people can see this campaign! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm so excited for this project, and I'm glad you're a part of it! Thank you so much! </p>
<p>Best, <br/>Calvin Limuel</p>

“My Gratitude” will contain songs I wrote as “hommages” toward the great musicians that have come before us and also the people in my life. Songs about, inspired, and for my musical heroes, mentors, and my mother. 
These two albums will also include bonus tracks and some exclusive to the campaign backers. 
Your contributions would help us pay for: 

the production process (studio recording time, mixing/mastering engineers, additional gears needed);
accommodation (transportation, food);
documentation (photo & video);
graphic designing;
distribution platforms;
marketing & promotional;
and of course, the musicians, engineers, and everybody involved.

In the case that our goal isn’t reached, we are still moving on with the process and hope that we’d still have enough resources (or even more backers) to complete the whole project. 
Other Ways You Can Help
You might not be able to contribute monetarily today, but you can still contribute by spreading the news! Use the convenient social sharing buttons on the side, so more people can see this campaign!

<h3>Who is The Sam &amp; Tony Show?</h3>
<p>The Sam &amp; Tony Show is made up of two music-loving artists who collided in Los Angeles and decided to meld their musical sensibilities into one songwriting powerhouse. Sam Johnides, originally from Michigan, has been a songwriter, pianist, guitarist, and drummer (amongst other musical talents) since his high school days and brought his array of musical skills to Los Angeles to become a music producer, composer, and performer. His successes in Los Angeles include winning Best Original Songwriting at the 2017 Hollywood Fringe Festival for <i>Turbulence</i> with Robot Teammate and composing the long-running <i>Trump in Space </i>at Second City Hollywood, written with Tony his co-writer, Gillian Bellinger, and Landon Kirksey. Tony Gonzalez, Texas-born and raised, after pursuing an operatic career finally found his true passion in songwriting and performing original music in Los Angeles. Sam and Tony’s collaborations have included film scores and songs (<i>Undocumented Salvation (</i>2017), <i>Lemon Drop</i> (2018)), composition for musicals (<i>Supportive White Parents</i>, <i>Look Out <i>Hollywood</i>!</i>, <i>Annabella</i>, <i>Happily Ever Under</i>), and original music for YouTubers and Podcasts (“Friends with Ben E Fitz,” “Still a Loser,” “Some Quest for Glory”). Their music video for their original single “Song You Made Me Write” can be found on YouTube.</p>
<h3>What is <i>Bravura</i>?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540502247/qrlcaj3bep75fsbeoihb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Bravura</i> is a large-scale world invented by The Sam &amp; Tony Show where circus tents are cities, ringleaders compete for the best acts by whatever means necessary, carnival life is <i>the </i>way of life, and the inhabitants either dedicate their lives to mastering their performance art, or become the outsiders that seek to undermine and dismantle the carnival world. The debut album <i>Bravura</i> will be a musical journey through that world, where each song is written to showcase the perspective of a particular inhabitant, ranging from the charismatic Ringmaster to the fire and brimstone-slinging Revival Preacher, from the less-than-enthusiastic Clowns to the odd Freaks who only want a place at the table. Every moment of the album is designed to transport you from everyday life into a musically soaring escape into this strange realm.</p>
<p>With the completion of this fundraising campaign, we will be able to record at the much-loved Studio City Sound in Studio City, California, owned by Grammy-award Winning Mixer Tom Weir. Your financial support means we can dedicate time to refining our instrumentals (we play all our own instruments), getting the best vocal takes, and mixing each track to sonic perfection so that the final product is as amazing as we hear it in our heads. Along with the release of the album on all major platforms (Amazon Music, Apple Music, iTunes, Pandora, Spotify), The Sam &amp; Tony Show will have something solid to take outside of California for our first venture out of state, bringing the fantastic sounds of <i>Bravura</i> abroad with a live band show that will be a night to remember. This album will truly be the next large step in our careers. Your help in funding it will not only be rewarded with various gifts listed on this campaign page, but will be returned with the deepest of gratitude from two guys from the Midwest and the Southwest who had a dream bigger than both of them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Will My Funds Go?</h3>
<p>Our initial goal is $10,000. We’ve broken down the cost of recording in the studio per song, having had some experience with our previous singles, and have found that one song, from top to bottom (rehearsal studio rentals, tracking instrumentals, recording vocals, and mixing) cost between $1200-$1600 per song. Our engineer extraordinaire, Jeff Ryon, is included in the hourly rate of the studio, and playing our own instruments cuts down on costs, but it is still a hefty financial undertaking! Our goal is to have at least <b>6</b><strong> </strong><strong>original songs </strong>to present once the project is complete (a full EP). We have no shortage of material, so should our fundraising goal be exceeded, we would be more than happy to add to that number for a full album! Once everything is mixed and mastered, we’ll do our official release on all major music download platforms, such as well as manufacture physical copies of the album.</p>
<p>A portion of the budget is also set aside for the commission of the artwork you see on display by the talented Michael Ramstead, which will appear on the album and on various merchandise to be sold at live shows. Manufacturing of CDs is another expense that we are read to undertake, but raising over our goal limit would surely help to ease that amount for us.</p>
<p>We’re excited to be able to return your generosity with some gifts! Depending on the level of funds you provide, we have various tiers of gifts available:</p>
<p>$20: <strong>Digital downloads of songs before official release. </strong>You’ll get to hear the music first, before we release everything on the major music platforms.</p>
<p>$35: <strong>Personalized copy of the <i>Bravura </i>Album. </strong>With this level of giving, you’ll have your own copy of <i>Bravura </i>along with a special “thank you” message from The Sam &amp; Tony Show.</p>
<p>$50: <b><i>Bravura </i>T-Shirt. </b>Along with the above-mentioned gifts, you’ll receive a T-shirt with some special lyrics from the album, “Give your pain another name,” along with the <i>Bravura </i>logo on  the back.</p>
<p>$100: <strong>Physical print of the original <i>Bravura</i></strong> <b>Artwork. </b>Our beautiful and macabre cover art, created by Michael Ramstead, will be provided in an 11x11 print for you to gaze at as you listen to the album at home.</p>
<p>$250: <b>Special Kat-thryn Cat Piano signed by Sam &amp; Tony. </b>If you haven’t seen our Instagram page, you’re missing out on getting acquainted with a little children’s instrument that made it into many of our shows and has become something of a mascot. We’ll sign your own personalized Kat-thryn and send it your way, and you will probably even get to rename her!</p>
<p>$500:<strong> Personalized Thank-You Song from The Sam &amp; Tony Show.</strong> We’re songwriters, so one of the best ways we know to gift people is through song! We’ll get some details from you about what you’d like your song to be about and go about crafting you your own original The Sam &amp; Tony Show composition.</p>
<p>$1000: <strong>Your Personal</strong><strong> Live Concert. </strong>If you’ve donated at this level, you’ve truly gone above and beyond and we would love to bring one of our The Sam &amp; Tony Show concerts right to you, either at your home or at a venue you’d provide. You can tell your friends and family you hosted Sam and Tony in a live concert and lived to tell the story! Certain travel restrictions and venue needs apply. Refer to the perks list for details.</p>
<p><strong>What we’ll do if we don’t reach our goal. </strong>Luckily for us, our vision for bringing our music from our minds to your ears is much bigger than any financial barriers. Should we not reach our campaign goal, we will still make use of whatever funds we’ve been able to collect and put it towards Studio City Sound. The main difference would be how quickly we could release the music, as we would work towards releasing the album no matter how much we achieved through the campaign. However, the more we raise with your help, the more songs we will have to share and the quicker you’ll have the album in hand!</p>

<h3>Why does <i>Bravura </i>matter?</h3>
<p>If you’re a fan of The Sam &amp; Tony Show, we hope that you are familiar with our commitment to artistically excellent music that is refreshingly original while still being completely accessible. If you don’t know us or our work, we invite you to get familiar with our output!</p>
<p> <a href=""http://www.thesamandtonyshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thesamandtonyshow.com</a></p>
<p>The world of pop music is, to some ears, disappointingly commercial and feels like something out of a factory (a very commercially successful factory), but without the organic approach of the songwriter transferring their ideas in an original and artistically committed way from page to stage. We understand the connection between artist and audience to be a two-way street. We want to provide the audience with something they haven’t heard before that speaks to them on an emotional level, while the audience wants to provide ears for our music as long as it isn’t alienating. <i>Bravura </i>is the perfect blend of modern rock and our distinct theatrical voice. It is musical escapism to the max, without being too commercially sanded down or too avant-garde.</p>
<p><i>Bravura</i>, while being some of the most fun we’ve had as composers, goes beyond just being escapism. The art we’re creating comes from very real places. “Hellfire and Devilry” was written as a vivid portrait of the fear and terror associated with growing up in the shadow of religiosity, afraid that my sins would condemn me to eternity in hell. “Freakshow” is an homage to all those who feel as if society has rejected them, for sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, background, medical condition, or any other reason that people use as grounds for rejection. No matter how outlandish our presentation of these songs, our emotional core is very grounded in what will speak to you, our audience. We write these songs as self-therapy. Hopefully a bit of that catharsis slips into your experience with The Sam &amp; Tony Show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How do I know you’ll follow through?</h3>
<p>Sam and I are, if anything, committed to making it through from the beginning of the project to the end of it. We have many other personal projects that have led to runs in theatres.</p>
<p>Our last crowdfunding campaign resulted our first self-produced musical <i>Annabella</i>, which was nominated for Most Outstanding Songwriting in the 2015 Hollywood Fringe Festival and had nine sold-out performances at the Lounge Theater. Subsequently it was given an eight-performance sold-out run at the Big Oak Theatre In Chatsworth, CA, produced by Avenue Act One. We know how to turn your generosity into something that takes on a life of its own, and we hope you’ll trust us on this journey as well.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZiajnuNwNQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Available to watch here is our first music video for our first wide-released single “Song You Made Me Write.” The process required casting, finding a crew, and a <i>lot </i>of dedication with it all coming together. As producers, we know how to put our all financially and artistically into a project so that it arrives to you, our audience, as fleshed out as possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>There are many ways in which you can help The Sam &amp; Tony Show reach its goal! Check out our available perks and see which gift your donation lines up with. No matter how much we raise, we will receive the majority of your gifts (IndieGoGo takes a small percentage as a fee for using their crowdfunding platform). Also use the IndieGoGo sharing tools provided so that you can let your friends and family know about your gifting and about our campaign.

We’re going to be releasing regular updates as the campaign continues so that you have an inside look at the exciting world of watching a little money bar slowly climb to 100%.</p>
<p>Please know that we are extremely grateful for your generosity, financial or otherwise, and hope that you’ll be a big part of bringing the music of <i>Bravura </i>to life.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This two-time Grammy nominee’s career has taken Cidny (Cindy) from singing back-up with Elton John to having eight critically acclaimed solo albums, including 1999's award winning “Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth”. Followed by “Neverland” and “dream #29” and Cid's 2010 ""Howling Trains and Barking Dogs"". In 2007 Cidny formed the “super-trio”- The Refugees- with songwriting greats Wendy Waldman and Deborah Holland. The Refugees released two CDs 2009's Unbound  and 2012's THREE. Both stayed on the Folk/Americana charts for many months. Since 2016, Cidny has been performing his autobiographical one person show Somewhere Between: Not An Ordinary Life  in theaters around the country, including Los Angeles, New York, and Nashville to rave reviews. In 2019,  the major documentary Invisible, directed by TJ Parsell, will be released in which Cid is featured. Also Cid will release his first album as ""Cidny Bullens"". He is writing and recording songs reflecting his last seven years of gender transition. In 2020, Cid's memoir will not be far behind.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>OK Folks! I'd like to raise $10,000 (as a start).  These funds will go partly for initial recording costs that include studio and musician fees. But MORE IMPORTANTLY for the hiring of a TOP publicist--who has to have at least three months ahead of release to start promoting. (That alone is the $10K).</p>
<p>What YOU get is the chance to contribute to a timely, relevant project, that I hope will reach a broad audience (akin to my album ""Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth""), about yet another misunderstood human element, condition, story. Being a transgender person is not a choice. We are born with the body of one gender and the brain (identity) of the other. Gender also is not binary, as we all have been conditioned to believe. But that's a long discussion. Because this reality is so misunderstood: people die. Trans people young and old, commit suicide. Or are brutally murdered. Thankfully, in the last few years, we have had known people ""come out"" and we've had more discussion and perhaps a bit more acceptance. But in this volatile political climate, right now, with so many other battles to fight, our progress has been limited. My story--like my one person show--is a human story. I am asking you to help me tell it in the most effective way I can. That takes money.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's my hope: After my album ""Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth"" was released 1999, I spent the next 15 years doing workshops, concerts and seminars for bereaved parents, the medical community, the psychology and sociology communities--at colleges, universities, and conferences, all over the country and actually in several other countries around the world.</p>
<p>I would like to do this again, now, on the subject of being transgender, wherever I possibly can.  My experience is that education, by personal contact, with a human story, told not only in words but in music, makes the greatest impact on the heart and mind.</p>
<p>You can help me do this.</p>

The songs are full of raw energy, in spite of the occasional mistakes the players may make. You can feel the creativity and the potential in the air. That's the feeling The Vlade had in mind for his debut album ""Dreams In The Basement"", an album he composed all music, played all instruments, recorded, programmed, mixed and designed all by himself. For better or for worse, The Vlade is continuing this vision in his second album, ""Changes"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who's The Vlade?</h3>
<p>Vancouver, British Columbia is what The Vlade calls home nowadays, but the singer/songwriter was born on the banks of the river Danube in his native Bulgaria. His love affair with music and art started very early on in his life, with his grandma's songs and paintings. Ever since he can remember, he has always been fascinated by the sounds and colors around him. <br/><br/>The Vlade taught himself to play the guitar around age thirteen, when his brother Julian brought one home. He began writing his own music soon after. His current musical style can be described as an eclectic blend of a wide range of musical influences - from traditional folk songs and acoustic sounds to electronic music and hard rock. Over the years that mesh has morphed into a uniquely wonderful style, showcased here on his first lo-fi album release, ""Dreams In The Basement"". <br/><br/>But The Vlade's talents do not end with his musical abilities. He is also an award-winning designer, humorous illustrator and animator, children's book author and cartoonist. And though music took a second seat to work and family, he is glad to be at a stage of his life when he can return to his first love.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>""It is never too late to follow a dream"", says The Vlade. ""Apart from the pure joy of creating music, teaching my kids to follow their dreams is the other reason why I recorded this album. You should always stay true to your real self, no matter what!""</p>

<p>My name Is Michael Forkuo and I'm from Worcester, Massachusetts. Ive been involved with worship music ministry for 20 years.</p>
<p>     My heart has always been to help followers of Jesus Christ (present &amp; future) see what worship is and how it can be enhanced or diminished by where and how we include God in our everyday lives. Monday through Saturday is where we all live and Sunday is where we often find a reason to celebrate. We all look forward to the ""locker room moments"" that Sunday mornings bring but when we head back out into the ""game"" often our faith, hope &amp; love are confronted by opposing forces. Many times all we're left with is questions.  And in the process of finding answers to the questions, how do you find your hallelujah?</p>
<p>     This is where I've been living for the past 2 &amp; 1/2 years and during this part of my journey I've been mercifully confronted by my continuous need to trust and surrender. Trust that if God has given me eternal security through Jesus Christ I need to learn to trust He will secure my everyday.  Surrender my desires, my hurt, my pain, my resentment and my constant need to understand and control the outcome. This is how the road to everything came about. </p>
<p>     I know that I am not alone on this road even though life and the enemy of my soul would love for me to believe that I am. However, God has amazing ways of making it glaringly apparent that there are others on this same road. We are not all at the same point on the road but the most important thing is that we are all traveling together on it. Letting Jesus into your heart is the first step but where do you go from there?</p>
<p>     More often than not, I find myself following Him and just trying to keep one foot in front of the other as I try and stay on this road. Where are you? Are you walking? Are you running? Are you following Him? My hope is that you'll join me on this journey and support me with finishing this EP.                            Thank you for your time. You're a blessing!</p>

<h3>Mon parcours</h3>
<p>D’origine arménienne, je suis née au Liban, parisienne de formation et montréalaise de cœur. Très jeune, j’ai développé une forte passion pour le piano et le chant, et ai eu le bonheur d’accompagner des artistes francophones de renoms tels que Bécaud, Aznavour, Moustaki, Ferrat et Léveillée dans leur tournées au Liban et participé au Festival international de la chanson de Sopot. </p>
<p>Après avoir obtenu un premier prix d'exécution à l'École normale de musique de Paris, je me suis lancée sur la trajectoire d'une carrière d'interprétation classique. Brisant les chaînes du classicisme, j’ai créé un répertoire empreint de tradition et d'originalité, où se fondent harmonieusement les sons d'Orient et d'Occident. Par la magie de l'intégration d'instruments aussi variés que le piano, le oud, le saxophone, les flûtes, les percussions, et par ma voix, je tente de rejoindre toutes les sensibilités. </p>
<p>Ma musique, à la frontière de l'interprétation et de la création, est le fruit d'une recherche constante d'équilibre entre qualité, précision, émotion et liberté d'expression.</p>
<p>Nourrie de ces expériences, j’ai composé mes propres chansons et me suis imposée sur la scène culturelle montréalaise depuis une vingtaine d'années. </p>
<p>En 2003, mon album Souffles d'Orient, a été nominé dans la catégorie Album de l'année - Musiques du monde au gala de l'ADISQ. </p>
<p>Mon second album “Lady Sylva”, quant à lui, coup de coeur Renaud-Bray, nous plongeait dans un univers plus intimiste avec une formule piano-voix.</p>
<p>Aujourd’hui, avec une sérénité retrouvée, celle d'une femme, d'une artiste affirmée et socialement engagée, j’ai décidé de me surprendre avec un nouveau projet touchant qui ne demande qu’à être bouclé ?</p>
<p>Pour la pré-production de ce nouvel opus  <strong>""À mon père""</strong>, j’ai décidé de vous (fans, amis et autres amoureux de la musique) impliquer en amont par le biais de cette campagne de préfinancement en collaboration avec l’organisme <strong>Hay Doun</strong>, dont la mission est d’intégrer les nouveaux arrivants et les plus démunis. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtiendrez</h3>
<p>En ce moment, j'ai pu finaliser la 1ère partie du plan de pré-production soit la conception d’une maquette pour mon mini-album grâce entre autre à de précieux collaborateurs qui souhaitent donner un coup de pouce à une artiste indépendante.</p>
<p>Toutefois, maintenant que je finalise la préparation de mon plan de production, je vous sollicite tous, familles, amis, contacts professionnels ou tout autre personne passionnée par mes oeuvres et/ou démarche artistique à vous impliquer dans ce projet passionnant.</p>
<p>Avec votre aide, je pourrai assurément aller de l'avant et franchir les étapes nécessaires à la production du mini-album physique dont l'investissement est assez conséquent. Les fonds que je tente d'obtenir permettront de couvrir:</p>
<ul>
<li>Le coût de production de l'album (enregistrement, mixage, mastering);</li>
<li>Les coûts de distribution (graphisme, révision, impression);</li>

<p>On April 16, 2019, with the help of the pledgers from Indiegogo, I’ve been able to raise the funds to produce a posthumous for my late uncle/godfather Daniel Coulanges who was introduced as ""One of the world's finest guitarist."" The album is titled ""World's Finest"" is 30 years in the making with a profound message, I hope if given the opportunity you and I can share this extraordinary story  to address the question; why it's crucial to #KnowMyStatus when in comes to HIV. But with the $1276 is needed to fulfill the reservations that already have made and cover the cost of the licensing fees.</p>
<p>According to the Miami Herald ""The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area led the nation in new HIV diagnoses in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

<p><strong>BY CHRISTINA MAYO</strong></p>
<p>'Paying tribute to a lost loved one can weigh heavily on our hearts. But Kendall resident Yanatha Desouvre has made it his mission to help the world know and remember his guitarist uncle and godfather, Daniel Coulanges, who died in 1989 at 28 of HIV/AIDS complications.</p>
<p>“Imagine the musicians Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, or Amy Winehouse, who all died at a very young age, had some rare unheard creative works that were never shared with the world. What would you do to get that music to the world?” Desouvre said in an email.</p>
<p>He last saw his godfather 27 years ago when Desouvre was an 11-year-old boy. Coulanges, was a classical Haitian guitarist, “like his award-winning, world-renowned accomplished older brother Amos Coulanges.” Another uncle in the musical family, Nito Coulanges, was in the Haitian gospel band, Echo Mysteriuex.</p>
<p>Desouvre discovered his late godfather’s music through its remarkable journey to him.</p>

<p>traveled from New York to Paris to Miami with Love.</p>
<p>“My Uncle Amos Coulanges said, ‘Nephew, someone told me they have a recording of Daniel playing guitar at a college in Staten Island, New York.’ He told me as soon as he gets it he’ll send me a copy,” Desouvre said.</p>
<p>“I received a gift I will never forget,” he said. “I opened the international package and silence filled the room. I put the DVD in my computer and with each guitar string, my godfather plucked I cried and cried. My godfather was speaking directly to me with each note.”</p>
<p>“He died on April 30, 1989, two years before Magic Johnson made his announcement, and never had an opportunity to share his talent with the world, until now,” Desouvre said.</p>
<p>In the grainy video Coulanges also plays a stunning classical guitar adaption of:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>“Ne Me Quitte Pas”</strong> by Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel.</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>
<p>Desouvre is trying to raise $1,358 update ($1280.71) (Since updated - $1267) through Indiegogo to have the recordings remastered, properly mixed and produced.</p>
<p>He is also trying to raise awareness about HIV testing through the project. Desouvre is a prolific author. He was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, grew up in Brooklyn and Philadelphia, and now lives in Kendall with his wife and three children. Another is on the way. He works at the University of Miami.</p>
<p>He said he remembers his godfather in the Brooklyn apartment. He remembers him playing guitar and he said he does not want to throw away his chance to share that music with the world.</p>
<p>“My wife and I named our second daughter Danielle after my godfather. She shares his drive, ambition and sense of humor,” he said.</p>
<p>As for the recording, he said, “I managed to extract the audio from the video performances. I plan to get the songs mastered and produced so we may share this sentimental musical and video project with the world title, ‘Daniel Coulanges — World's Finest — Live in New York’ because that was how the host introduced my godfather.”</p>
<p>He relates to and quotes “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and the words in Miranda’s Tony acceptance speech: “Nothing here is promised, not one day.”</p>
<p>“I strongly agree with Lin-Manuel Miranda. I also believe since we all only have just one life to live we must all live that life to the fullest,” Desouvre said. “This is a story of how a nephew/godson wants to honor the legacy of his musically gifted late uncle/godfather Daniel Coulanges. That nephew/godson is me.”</p>
<p>Desouvre is planning to release the album for his godfather in January.</p>
<p>“After the album is produced all the proceeds from that album will create a fund to establish and finance a not-for-profit center called Daniel Coulanges Center for Arts, Technology, and Business where there will be workshops and classes for anyone who wants to learn the business of the art that they are passionate about,” Desouvre said.</p>

The World's Finest project was able to raise  381.54 (including Indiegogo's fees) in Part 1, 335.05 in Part 2 and $85 this heartwarming project, however, the journey continues. If you are a vinyl collector this one is for you.</p>
<p>In 1989, two years before Magic Johnson announced he was HIV-positive, My uncle and godfather lost his life to AIDS; he was a mere 28 years old. Although his life ended far too soon I am working on his legacy will lasting forever with this Indiegogo project to bring the recently found rare recording to life. I'm working with my uncle and godfather's music to raise awareness about HIV, encouraging everyone to know their own HIV status. This is important everywhere, but especially in Miami-Dade County, which Care Sources indicates is the number one county in Florida for new cases of HIV.</p>
<p>It all started last spring when I received a package in the mail. I opened the box, found a video, placed it in his video player, and pressed play. The harmonious sounds of his my late uncle and godfather, Daniel Coulanges, filled the room as he played an unaccompanied classical guitar adaptation of: ""Ne Me Quitte Pas, Don’t Cry for Me Argentina, Killing Me Softly and many more I felt my late uncle and godfather's presence as if they were in the same room.</p>
<p>With your pledges, I am confident we will get the music mastered and produce the album.</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to share your talents with the world? What if you never had a chance to? My late uncle and godfather Daniel Coulanges described as, ""The world's finest guitarist"" died at the young age of 28 years old on April 30th, 1989 of HIV/AIDS. At that time it was a death sentence.

Your generous pledge will help awareness of the importance of one knowing their HIV status negative or positive.  </p>
<p>Daniel never had an opportunity to share his talents with the world. Thanks to my other uncle Amos Coulanges, he was able to get rare footage of his late baby brother Daniel performing. My wife and I named our second daughter Danielle after my late godfather/uncle. Danielle has his sense of humor, candidness, and adventure.</p>

Kendall man on a mission to remind the world of late uncle’s talent for guitar playing
BY CHRISTINA MAYO
'Paying tribute to a lost loved one can weigh heavily on our hearts. But Kendall resident Yanatha Desouvre has made it his mission to help the world know and remember his guitarist uncle and godfather, Daniel Coulanges, who died in 1989 at 28 of HIV/AIDS complications.
“Imagine the musicians Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, or Amy Winehouse, who all died at a very young age, had some rare unheard creative works that were never shared with the world. What would you do to get that music to the world?” Desouvre said in an email.

ONE LAST THING​
I encourage everyone reading this to pursue your passion intentionally with purpose because if you don't; no one else will. No one is promised tomorrow so why not pursue your passion with the natural gifts that you've been given right NOW.
To paraphrase a conversation I recently had with someone. We are killing ourselves softly with each moment that passes when we don't at least attempt to express and share our talents with each other. But letting your light shine you unknowingly inspire others to shine their lights as well. It is never too late until it is.
RISKS and CHALLENGES​
The risk and challenges that come with completing this project are not getting the funds to produce the album in a professional manner. With your pledges, I am confident we will support this project fully funded​",5.0,4,"28 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""The Oubliette"" is the fifth full-length album coming from The Reticent and like its predecessor, ""On The Eve Of A Goodbye,"" this record will be an intense autobiographical concept record - this time focusing on Alzheimer's disease.  Having witnessed the profound and devastating impact of Alzheimer's firsthand, I have found it imperative to craft an album of substance and quality.  As such, I am seeking to return to my friend and producer Jamie King (BTBAM, Scale The Summit, Contortionist, etc.) at the Basement Studios to record this album and make it as intense and enriching as it possibly can be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Goal is to raise at least $3,000 to cover the cost of the recording.  A stretch goal of $4,000 would ensure that funds are ready to get the first ever vinyl pressing of an album from The Reticent.</p>
<p>The perks we offer for donating include: </p>
<ul>
<li>getting the album in physical form before anyone else</li>
<li>special edition shirts (limited to 25)</li>
<li>special edition hoodies (limited to 20)</li>
<li>signed gear from the recording of ""The Oubliette"" and ""On The Eve Of A Goodbye"" including drum heads, cymbals, and sheet music with notes</li>
<li>a live private performance by The Reticent with a setlist of your choosing</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As stated in the campaign video, Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in the US and about half of all adults over 85 have the disease.  The disease often gets reduced to just ""forgetfulness"" or ""senility"" but it is substantially more pernicious than those colloquial descriptions.  Art and more specifically music has a way of reaching people and opening them up to experiences that they may not understand.  While we have no illusions about this album become a worldwide phenomenon, it nonetheless may reach people that can benefit from it.  Those that have watched a love one pass from the illness, those that currently know or care for someone with the illness, and those that may want to know more about the illness.  As has long been the case, the goal of The Reticent is to make music that means something and can <i>do</i> something as well.  As we did with suicide prevention organizations when ""On The Eve Of A Goodbye"" was released, The Reticent will be donating funds from the album and holding fundraising performances for organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association, the American Brain Foundation, and the Alive Inside Foundation (a group that seeks to provide Alzheimer's patients with music).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any album, hiccups may occur in the recording process.  Though we have every expectation of completing the record in a timely manner, unforeseen circumstances could cause delays or setbacks.  The good news is that the material is all completely written and ready to be recorded so any technical issues or illnesses preventing recording (or affecting vocal quality) would be merely temporary delays.  Having recorded at the Basement Studios before and working with Jamie King already, the rhythm of the process should be even better than on ""Eve.""</p>
<p>Perks will be available once the process is completed and, again, any delays in delivering the rewards would only be minor and/or temporary.</p>

<p><u><strong>Our Mission </strong></u></p>
<p>Our mission is to increase the accessibility of classical music to the community. The project will empower and connect people through musical collaborations and shared values. Our festival is a celebration of community partnerships which we would like to strengthen for the benefit of the local music scene. </p>
<p><strong><u>How MIC came about </u></strong></p>
<p>The summer months, and July in particular, are a time when musical activity in University Circle is curtailed. The Cleveland Orchestra plays at the Blossom Music Center and most music students and faculty members of the Cleveland Institute of Music are away for summer festivals. We identified a need for high quality and accessible musical programs for the community.  We would like to utilize the wealth of resources and facilities, as well as the existing infrastructure in the area to offer a summer series, a rejuvenating addition to the local scene.  </p>
<h3><strong>How we’ll make it happen </strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Diverse Programming</u>  </strong></p>
<p>MIC concerts feature all-time favorite gems of the chamber music repertoire, alongside exciting new music, composed and curated by our Composer-in-Residence Chris Neiner. Our festival celebrates emerging musicians and composers, introducing a fresh and dynamic addition to the traditional music scene. One of our programs will be tailored to young children and their families and will be complemented by narration. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554596612/mbzsnofvyo9klqd3mbma.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Engaging the Next Generation</i></p>
<p><strong><u>Diverse Venue Settings </u></strong></p>
<p>Our festival will present an authentic, intimate connection between our audience and the collaborating artists. We will present our concerts in well-established concert venues as well as non-traditional spaces. The Cleveland Institute of Music will sponsor one of our concerts, and the gala concert will be held on July 14th at the Cleveland Museum of Art, followed by a reception at Judson Manor, who will host an additional concert. We will offer concerts at the Cleveland Public Library, the University Circle United Methodist Church, Council Gardens, Jennings Center for Adults, and numerous other locations! There will be a concert at NIGHTTOWN Restaurant and Bar, featuring a variety of musical styles.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Intergenerational Collaboration </strong></u></p>
<p>The project is presented in collaboration with Judson Manor, a retirement community which serves as home for the Cleveland’s Women’s Orchestra, as well as Theatre in the Circle. The artists traveling from abroad will be offered residency at Judson Manor, including room and board, as well as rehearsal facilities. In recognition of this kind and generous hospitality, we will offer a free program at the Manor’s newly-renovated ballroom. Several of the residents of the Manor are former music industry professionals. They will serve as ambassadors of the project, sharing their knowledge and experience, hosting the resident-musicians and ushering for the various events. Another aspect of the intergenerational partnership will be reflected in young promising artists working together with established ones, sharing a wealth of knowledge and experience between one generation and the next.      </p>

<p>Hello and welcome to our campaign to raise funds to record and release our new album!</p>
<p>We - Quest Ensemble - Filipe Sousa (piano),  Preetha Narayanan (violin) and  Tara Franks (cello) have been playing and composing together for nearly 10 years. We're driven by a curiosity to explore how three individual voices can become greater than the sum of their parts and so we write all our music collaboratively.</p>
<p>Since our first album ‘Footfall’ was released in 2014, amongst an array of other performance and community projects, we have been playing and creating away together and...</p>
<p>We are really excited to finally be recording this second album ' The Other Side' – a collection of new pieces we have been developing, remaking, reshaping over the last few years - the results of a long journey of digging, investigating and finding our sound as a trio.  Unlike 'Footfall', which we chose to record live, this time we have decided to work in a radically new way for us, multi-tracking our parts to make a studio album with talented producer/composer Fred Thomas. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<h3>‘It all started with a drop of ink and a musical note’</h3>
<p>In Autumn 2018 we were commissioned to create a large-scale cross arts show at the Big Bang Festival, CCB Lisbon - with wonderful visual artist and friend Somang Lee (who will create the artwork for the album).  It was a truly inspiring experience that brought our new compositions alive both sonically and visually.  This geared us up to put our next collection of work out into the world as  'The Other Side'.  The launch of which will sit alongside the tour of our show ‘It all started…’</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The back story</h3>
<p>We first met at Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 2008 and since then we have created our own collaborative way of composing music. We write by ear, we use improvisation and develop pieces from small starting points. The process is completely collaborative, takes time and requires democracy (not always easy!). We draw on our varied influences from contemporary classical, to world folk to jazz, and subsequently...fit into no one set genre box.</p> <h3>Collaboration and making music with others</h3>
<p>Over the last decade we have worked together in many creative settings. Individually and collectively, we've performed with influential artists including Kate Tempest, Sam Lee, Anoushka Shankar, Manu Delago, Talvin Singh, and Jocelyn Pook, amongst others. We have written music with young musicians, old and non-musicians, been commissioned to write music for dance and theatre pieces, worked with orchestras, in care homes, in prisons, with babies, parents and more - all alongside creating our own repertoire of music as a trio.</p>
<p>Writing music with others is really important to us and feeds back into our work as a trio. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li><p>BY SIGNING UP TO A PERK: From pre-ordering a copy of the album to having us come and play in your sitting room you will enable us to fund the production (recording, mixing, mastering) studio hire, album art work and printing costs.</p></li>
<li><p>THE MONEY: We need £6200 to finish recording and mixing and mastering the music, this includes studio rental and producer's and engineers' fees. The additional £3200 will go towards the art work of the project, manufacturing a short run of CDs and Vinyls and some PR support.</p></li>
<li><p>ABOUT THE GOAL: If we do not make the £9400 goal it will simply take longer to finish the album. We're committed to making it happen.</p></li>
<li><p>If we raise more than the goal, we'll make a high quality music video, press more vinyl, and invest in publishing and PR to push the project further. Donations of all amounts are greatly appreciated. </p></li>
<li><p>You don't need to claim a perk to make a contribution</p></li>
<li><p>AND you can always contribute a higher amount than the perk level you wish to claim.</p></li>

<h3>Thank you</h3>
<p>We are so grateful for your support to record, produce and mix our second album at this turning point. </p>
<p>We totally understand that so many musicians and artists are in the same boat and constantly working out how to support their work and keep it going. Any way you can help is massively appreciated – a pre-order of the album or even sharing the campaign with anyone else you think might to support.</p>

ABOUT THE GOAL: If we do not make the £9400 goal it will simply take longer to finish the album. We're committed to making it happen.
If we raise more than the goal, we'll make a high quality music video, press more vinyl, and invest in publishing and PR to push the project further. Donations of all amounts are greatly appreciated. 
You don't need to claim a perk to make a contribution
AND you can always contribute a higher amount than the perk level you wish to claim.

 
Thank you
We are so grateful for your support to record, produce and mix our second album at this turning point. 
We totally understand that so many musicians and artists are in the same boat and constantly working out how to support their work and keep it going. Any way you can help is massively appreciated – a pre-order of the album or even sharing the campaign with anyone else you think might to support.
Thank you!
Tara (cello), Preetha (violin) and Filipe (piano)

<h2>My Dream, My Passion, My Vision</h2>
<p>Four years ago I moved to Lincoln,
Nebraska and fell in love with the local live music scene. It all began at The
Cask, where I worked as a bartender and became enthralled with the live music
we had every Friday and Saturday. My involvement in local live music grew into
friendships with the musicians, booking music, managing musicians, creating and
running an open mic night, and lastly, creating a business centered around
helping local musicians and music-related ventures with social media,
marketing, and promotion. </p>
<p>Through my experience with local live
music in Lincoln, as a music fan, working in venues as a bartender/booking
agent/event planner, and on the musician’s side of things as a manager, I
developed a dream to create a music venue that was centered around supporting
local artists, paying artists a decent wage, respecting artists, having the
best sound possible, and as a result, creating an incredible live music
experience for fans through our focus on having very happy artists. </p>
<p>I found a home for my vision at the
Night Owl Pub when I struck up a business partnership between myself, with
Storm Media Management, and the owner, Chris Rosiak. I relocated my open mic
from The Cask to the Night Owl, purchased over $1000 worth of equipment, named
my open mic Lincoln Open Mic Night, and took over booking music at the Night
Owl, all in the span of a few weeks. Things are going REALLY well! But we NEED
more equipment!</p>
<p>Because the Night Owl Pub is so
focused on supporting all things local—local breweries, local musicians, local
writers, local artists—I’ve decided to help speed the equipment purchase and
installation along by calling on local people to support this mission. The goal
here is to raise enough money to purchase the rest of the equipment we need to
have stage lighting and all sound permanently placed, ready for an artist or band
to plug in, and a sound booth for professional sound engineers to operate. </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need and What You Get</h2> <p>
</p>
<h3>Sound Equipment:</h3>
<h4><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">FRONT

<p>Behringer X32 Digital Mixer, Grundorf 12U rack case, DBX 1231 Graphic, EQ DBX 266XL

<p><span>***If you're into Lincoln history, the system being purchased here is from the old Duggan's Pub and it's kind of a nice passing of the torch from one historical music venue to another working on making history.</span></p>
<h4>LED
Stage Lighting</h4>
<p>The
first order of business is going to be getting all of the sound equipment in,
so even if the goal isn’t reached, what money is raised will be going to the
sound equipment first, stage and lighting second.</p>
<p>If
we exceed the goal, the extra money will go to sound engineers, additional
sound equipment, and other things needed to enhance the live music experience for
everyone!</p>
<p>What you'll get is an incredible new home for live local music and art here in Lincoln!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>I have a much larger vision for the
Night Owl Pub than just creating a new live music venue. I’m taking my love of
our local music here in Lincoln to a new level with my business, Storm Media
Management. I’m taking photo and video of the artists and writing about them in
my blog. I’m building a YouTube channel full of amazing local talent and I plan
to use my increasing knowledge of social media to spread the word far beyond
Lincoln. </p>
<p>The Night Owl Pub is my home base,
and has all the ingredients necessary to create a new music scene here in
Lincoln. A great music venue can do that. The timing couldn’t be better as
Lincoln is becoming recognized as a music city while simultaneously losing a
great deal of live music venues (most recently Knickerbockers and The Cask to
name a few.)</p>
<p>We have an AWESOME team working to
bring all of this together. The Night Owl has a very enthusiastic, hard-working
owner in Chris as well as Red Rebel Media building a killer website for The
Night Owl and running social media promotional efforts, and then there’s me
with all my drive and passion running Lincoln Open Night through Storm Media
Management.</p>
<p>We’ve already created an awesome
green room, which is about to have its walls lined with black and white, signed
posters of all our “green-room-worthy” local artists who’ve played The Owl. It
looks like something straight out of Rolling Stone magazine and we are already
imagining photos of bands chilling on the L-shaped couches surrounded by all the
black and white, signed posters.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>There’s no risk here, just the
challenge of getting all the tools we need to grow at a faster rate with the
help of the community than we’d be able to accomplish on our own. If you’re a
musician, music-lover, a writer, an artist, or an art-lover, then it’s
beneficial for you to jump on board and throw a few dollars into this campaign,
because we’re creating a home for you guys! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>You don’t have to contribute
financially in order to help! Helping get the word out by sharing this campaign
page or just showing up and/or bringing people to the launch party Saturday,
March 19<sup>th</sup> is a HUGE contribution to this cause! </p>
<p>You can share this campaign page across any social media platform
or just tell people about it!</p>
<p>I want to send a HUGE THANK YOU to those who have already
shared my posts about this campaign as I was in the process of creating it, to
those who have already signed up to help in the launch party creation, as well
as promises to donate, and THANK YOU in advance to all those who will be
contributing over the course of the campaign! Love to YOU ALL!</p>

***If you're into Lincoln history, the system being purchased here is from the old Duggan's Pub and it's kind of a nice passing of the torch from one historical music venue to another working on making history.
LED
Stage Lighting
The
first order of business is going to be getting all of the sound equipment in,
so even if the goal isn’t reached, what money is raised will be going to the
sound equipment first, stage and lighting second.
If
we exceed the goal, the extra money will go to sound engineers, additional
sound equipment, and other things needed to enhance the live music experience for
everyone!
What you'll get is an incredible new home for live local music and art here in Lincoln!

The Impact 

I have a much larger vision for the
Night Owl Pub than just creating a new live music venue. I’m taking my love of
our local music here in Lincoln to a new level with my business, Storm Media
Management. I’m taking photo and video of the artists and writing about them in
my blog. I’m building a YouTube channel full of amazing local talent and I plan
to use my increasing knowledge of social media to spread the word far beyond
Lincoln. 
The Night Owl Pub is my home base,
and has all the ingredients necessary to create a new music scene here in
Lincoln. A great music venue can do that. The timing couldn’t be better as
Lincoln is becoming recognized as a music city while simultaneously losing a
great deal of live music venues (most recently Knickerbockers and The Cask to
name a few.)
We have an AWESOME team working to
bring all of this together. The Night Owl has a very enthusiastic, hard-working
owner in Chris as well as Red Rebel Media building a killer website for The
Night Owl and running social media promotional efforts, and then there’s me
with all my drive and passion running Lincoln Open Night through Storm Media
Management.
We’ve already created an awesome
green room, which is about to have its walls lined with black and white, signed
posters of all our “green-room-worthy” local artists who’ve played The Owl. It
looks like something straight out of Rolling Stone magazine and we are already
imagining photos of bands chilling on the L-shaped couches surrounded by all the
black and white, signed posters.

Risks & Challenges 

There’s no risk here, just the
challenge of getting all the tools we need to grow at a faster rate with the
help of the community than we’d be able to accomplish on our own. If you’re a
musician, music-lover, a writer, an artist, or an art-lover, then it’s
beneficial for you to jump on board and throw a few dollars into this campaign,
because we’re creating a home for you guys! 

Other Ways You Can Help 

You don’t have to contribute
financially in order to help! Helping get the word out by sharing this campaign
page or just showing up and/or bringing people to the launch party Saturday,
March 19th is a HUGE contribution to this cause!

</h3> <p>My name is TyLean, and I am an avant-garde singer, composer and recording artist. I've released six albums and made guest appearances on albums by Attrition, Acclimate V.1, Rossetti's Compass and many others.  (You can download three free songs at <a href=""http://www.tyleanpolley.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TyLeanPolley.com</a>)</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also a wife and mother to two wonderful little boys. My family loves Christmas - who doesn't? Well... some things we don't love about it. As atheists, we don't love how every year Christians declare that there is a war on Christmas and try to make non-Christians feel as though they have no right to celebrate the holidays. But - of course - that's nonsense! Human beings across the globe, spanning vast gulfs of time, have always celebrated at that time of year. In fact, most of the perceived ""Christian"" traditions are - in fact - not from Christianity, but borrowed and assimilated from the Romans and Pagans. No one owns any holidays, and everyone should be able to celebrate as they wish. </p>
<p>For us, that means family, gifts, good food... and music!</p>
<p>But all the best Christmas music is deeply religious. We didn't care<i> that much </i>before we had kids.... but now... in our opinions, religion is a systemic problem, and the last thing we want to do is bring that flavor of indoctrination into our home. </p>
<p>So I decided to start writing new versions! All the best traditional music with new, non-religious music. (No Santa either.... indoctrination of a different sort I would also like to avoid). When I told my friends what I was up to, they all expressed the same frustration of feeling like hypocrites, because they love the religious Christmas music so much. I decided to share the new Christmas songs with the world, and I booked myself some studio time!<br/><br/>The working track list includes the following:<br/>1. O Holy Night!

I'm an independent artist, activist and music producer based in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. My first two, self-produced albums, were Juno nominated. Pretty amazing considering that I'm an independent female artist.
I love my community and I hope to establish a small studio where artists (especially women/BIPOC) are able to feel comfortable and record their music or other media projects with (me) a producer who knows what it's like to be on the other side.
This campaign is about supporting independent female producers. By supporting this campaign, you are helping pave the way for female/BIPOC artists, not just in the region but Canada-wide and world-wide. This campaign is going to allow me to put funds towards projects that will lead to the creation of a studio that will #supportfemaleproducers.  This campaign is going to start a conversation about the lack of diversity in the Canadian music industry and how to #supportfemaleproducers.   What We Need & What You Get  I'm looking to raise $20,000 to pay for the costs of pre-production, production and post production.

This includes renting a larger studio for certain instruments, paying the musicians I hire, having my music professionally mixed and mastered so that it can compete with larger commercial projects being put out by major labels.

The ultimate goal is producing my third album independently and having quality produced songs that I can share on an international platform.

Perks for you for helping fund this campaign:
 $10 CAD - Digital Delight -You will receive a digital download of the album and my sincere gratitude for helping support female producers.
$20 CAD + Shipping - Let's Get Physical - You will receive a physical copy of the album and my sincere gratitude for helping support female producers.
$50 CAD + Shipping - Signed Syllables - You will receive a signed copy of the book accompanying the album and my sincere gratitude for helping support female producers.
$75 CAD + Shipping - Signed & Sealed - You will receive a signed copy of the book accompanying the album, a signed copy of the album, and my sincere gratitude for helping support female producers.
$100 CAD + Shipping - Tickets & Tangibles - You will receive a ticket to the album release party, a signed copy of the book accompanying the album, a signed copy of the album, and my sincere gratitude for helping support female producers.
$100 CAD - Music Video Easter Eggs - You will choose 1 Easter Egg* to be put in the music video for the album's single. You will meet with my to figure out all of the little details. *Easter Eggs are hidden jokes, references, etc. often found in movies and video games

What happens if this campaign does not reach it's goal?

 Every dollar put into this campaign is going towards the production of this album, music video, and #supportfemaleproducers campaign, no matter if the goal is reached on not.    Why only 5% of music producers are women... This year, only 32.8% of Juno Nominees were women. Of all the potential nominees in the production category, there was only one single female co-credit. The Junos have said that this is 'simply a reflection of who is submitting'. If so, why aren't more female artists/producers submitting and why are there so few female producers in the first place? Women are deterred from entering production sphere because it’s a man’s world, and so we have less female producers than we should, and this reflects in the awards.   Since it was introduced in 1974, only six women have been nominated for ""Producer Of The Year"" at The Grammy's. As one of the few female producers to be twice nominated for a Juno, the Canadian music industry desperately needs to change to truly represent the diversity of Canadian producers.
The goal of #supportfemaleproducers is to change the Canadian music scene. My long term goal of creating a studio that will focus on female BIPOC artists needs the success of this Indiegogo campaign and the #supportfemaleproducers campaign.    Risks & Challenges  Being a female producer in Canada is not an easy journey. With little to no representation in the production field, it is a constant uphill journey to be represented in the industry, let alone recognized.  I've been an independent artist for 5 years, and over these 5 years, I've pieced together a team that truly supports me. When you are first starting out as a female independant artist, it is incredibly difficult to navigate the industry and find a team. By creating a conversation about how to #supportfemaleproducers, by creating a studio that addresses female BIPOC independant artists' needs, by addressing the lack of diversity and representation in the Canadian music industry, we can break these barriers and challenges.

When it was first suggested to me that I might like to do a collaboration with a group of street youths in Sierra Leone I wondered what we could possibly have in common. How can my experiences compare with theirs and how would we write lyrics that co-exist? The first track they sent me was about life on the streets and for them that meant no food, nowhere to sleep and running from the police. I don’t have that experience, but I know what it feels like to worry about money, work and reaching your goals in life. This is what came out of that collaboration:<br/>Full song with music video:<br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWbeRzkLLgc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWbeRzkLLgc</a><br/>Short documentary about the collaboration:<br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY61O5oL_bM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY61O5oL_bM</a><br/>During the year we have had contact on Facebook, whenever the guys have access to Internet, which is not too often.

We all dream of the same things, safety, stability, happiness and love, but we have very different opportunities and access.<br/>When you live on the streets, somewhere like Sierra Leone, with little access to information and the Internet, you can feel pretty left behind by the world -unimportant and hopeless.

It’s been an incredible journey and I even had the privilege to do backing vocals for legendary Earl Sixteen. I write lyrics about issues close to my heart, Politics, Injustice, Feminism, Racism and everything else that lingers in my mind and have recently started combining my love for music with my passion to create change through Charity.Last summer I release a track called ‘Amsterdamage’ and gave half of all profits to ‘Women’s Aid’, the national charity for victims of domestic abuse. Feel free to visit my YouTube Channel to get a clearer view of who I am:www.youtube.com/sravidmusicwww.facebook.com/shellyravidWAYout Arts Sierra Leone provides recording opportunities for street youths who live in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Read more about them here: http://www.wayoutarts.org/What obstacles may we come across?Thanks to Hazel, the actual filmmaking will not be a problem as well as recording facilities and producers provided by WAYout Arts. The main worry is if we don’t raise enough funds for me to actually travel.

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>We believe that music and sacred sound have the power to change and heal the world. And our mission is to share positive, uplifting music that inspires us all to rise above the mundane and joyfully live life to the fullest. Our desire is to create a soundtrack for living a life filled with purpose and passion, and then set the world on fire with love. Our music, filled with love and mantra (Sanskrit for ""protective tool for the mind""), sends out positive vibes to work on us at the most subtle levels--especially in calming the sympathetic nervous system, as well as sends a positive message to reprogram our thought and emotional patterns.</p>

<p>Growing up, I (Randall) accepted these type of negative suggestions from my environment, and it led me to a path of turmoil, substance abuse, violence, and aggression in my teens, and the music I listened to reinforced that identity. One night, I was fortunate to hear a song that told me a different story--that I was much more than what I had been living, that I had a purpose and was worthy to live a better life. It broke me down. I listened to that song over and over and over, allowing it to repeat all night while I slept. When I awoke the next morning, my trajectory had completely changed. And then my life changed. It was then that I began to realize the awesome power of music, and I wanted to be a part of that. It soon became my desire to write songs and share music that were inspiring and thought provoking—songs to invite others to stop and think a little more. </p>

<p>Soon after, this boy from the hood met a girl from the west side (Kristin) who grew up surrounded by all types of music from classical to the Beatles, playing piano, writing music, singing in musical theatre productions and choirs as well as various  local bands, and who had even been a music major in college. Though from very different worlds, our voices and our hearts came together so effortlessly, and she shared my passion to share inspiring (and maybe a little controversial) music. So here we are now. We've been singing together for 22 years and married nearly 20. Completely devoted to one another as well as to our dharma (life purpose) and musical mission to spread love through song, we have shared our music as <i>Bhakti House Band  </i>(which means the <i>House of Love and Devotion)  </i>for about 8 years now. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484330290/eou0tsal8awvi7er5jru.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Our country and even our world have seemed to be in an uproar lately, with many left feeling lost and in tremendous fear. United we stand; divided we fall, and our world needs healing more than ever. Music is a universal language that unifies and speaks directly to the heart. Kristin and I have personally experienced the healing power of music and are devoted to paying that forward and creating more music that heals and inspires all of us to live a full and empowered life.</p>
<p>We all deserve to experience love. And when we feel love, we are likely to share more love in service to others while bringing forth our gifts into greater purpose. But no one can do this alone. We are ALL here to support one another. That's why this project is so important... The more people we can reach and inspire with our music, the more people that could be inspired to heal their wounds. And when we free ourselves (and others) from our wounds, our hearts open, we feel connected to the world around us, and move with more compassion and wisdom. IMAGINE a world where LOVE and KINDNESS motivate us rather than fear; a world working in harmony to uplift and EMPOWER everyone.

<p> </p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is to create a new album, which will draw from our roots like never before. We will be integrating everything from old gospel and church hymns to rap and hip hop to tibetan bowls, beloved classical sanskrit mantras, and kirtan. We combine western and eastern instrumentation and rich  harmonies, all driven by a powerful combination of drums and percussion from different cultures all over the world. These various healing musical influences represent seeds of our musical past that have brought us to THIS present moment. As we integrate our experiences and expand our world view, the music we create continues to evolve to reach out to a broader audience. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have amazing perks and gifts in exchange for your support! So as to keep the stress down of whether or not we meet our financial goals on time here and be able to receive funds for the project and meet our deadlines, we have divided the project into several phases, and had set the initial phase goal at $5400<strong> </strong>and<strong> SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PHASE 1 </strong>in time to reach <strong>InDemand</strong> status! BUT it will actually take about <strong>5 times</strong> that to create the ideal campaign and be able to do everything we hope to do with this album. We have recorded most of the album music thanks to the funds from phase 1 and are ready to complete <strong>PHASE 2 </strong>so we can begin some of the the mixing and mastering!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1: production/recording studio fees: $5400... COMPLETE! YAY!</strong></li>

<strong>Phase 2: mixing and mastering fees: $5400 for a total of $10,800 </strong>(<i>in progress...</i>)</li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's a new genre of music forging its way across the globe... a music revolution, if you will! And it's inspiring humanity, continually calling forth more love, more authenticity, and more empowerment in our LIVES! The only risk here is buying into a world of negativity and then standing alone, immobilized, watching life pass you by from the sidelines. Instead, why not buy into the power and possibility of love and then help us to spread that love, kindness, healing, and inspiration through uplifting music by giving to this project. We choose the latter, and you can count on us to see this project through to the finish. We don't give up until we're done. We have completed 4 other albums prior and have gathered supporting fans now in more than 52 countries, so we are confident that we can count on YOU to help us achieve this dream! Join the revolution! </p>

“The highest goal of music is to connect one’s soul to their Divine Nature, not entertainment.”
~Pythagoras (569- 475 BC)
 
Hi, we are Randall and Kristin Brooks of Bhakti House Band, and we want to invite YOU to join us in something life-altering… world-changing… revolutionary…
 

Sunrise 108 Gayatri Meditation workshop, Fort Lauderdale, FL
 
Music Has the Power to Change the World
 
We believe that music and sacred sound have the power to change and heal the world. And our mission is to share positive, uplifting music that inspires us all to rise above the mundane and joyfully live life to the fullest. Our desire is to create a soundtrack for living a life filled with purpose and passion, and then set the world on fire with love. Our music, filled with love and mantra (Sanskrit for ""protective tool for the mind""), sends out positive vibes to work on us at the most subtle levels--especially in calming the sympathetic nervous system, as well as sends a positive message to reprogram our thought and emotional patterns.
 
We all live in a society that tells us that love and kindness are not the norm. We are surrounded by programming from the media, news, politicians, and advertisers all telling us that we are broken in some way.They insist that the world is full of nothing but evil and hate at every turn, that we are doomed, and only they can save us. If we accept these suggestions as truth, then our reality will follow. 
 
But... we are here to challenge all of that.
 

 
Great teachers of the past tell us that ""suggestion"" is the most powerful force in the universe… that life itself was born through the power of suggestion. 100% of our human behavior is a direct result of suggestion, whether that suggestion comes from ourselves or from our environment.
What you feed grows, and what you feed yourself is what you become.
 

 
This is especially true regarding music since music has been proven to be one of the fastest and most powerful ways to instill new suggestions or change thought patterns.
That's where we come in...
 
 
A little background...

Growing up, I (Randall) accepted these type of negative suggestions from my environment, and it led me to a path of turmoil, substance abuse, violence, and aggression in my teens, and the music I listened to reinforced that identity. One night, I was fortunate to hear a song that told me a different story--that I was much more than what I had been living, that I had a purpose and was worthy to live a better life. It broke me down. I listened to that song over and over and over, allowing it to repeat all night while I slept. When I awoke the next morning, my trajectory had completely changed. And then my life changed. It was then that I began to realize the awesome power of music, and I wanted to be a part of that. It soon became my desire to write songs and share music that were inspiring and thought provoking—songs to invite others to stop and think a little more. 
 
Boy Meets Girl

 +  = 

Soon after, this boy from the hood met a girl from the west side (Kristin) who grew up surrounded by all types of music from classical to the Beatles, playing piano, writing music, singing in musical theatre productions and choirs as well as various  local bands, and who had even been a music major in college. Though from very different worlds, our voices and our hearts came together so effortlessly, and she shared my passion to share inspiring (and maybe a little controversial) music. So here we are now. We've been singing together for 22 years and married nearly 20. Completely devoted to one another as well as to our dharma (life purpose) and musical mission to spread love through song, we have shared our music as Bhakti House Band  (which means the House of Love and Devotion)  for about 8 years now. 

 
The Impact
Our country and even our world have seemed to be in an uproar lately, with many left feeling lost and in tremendous fear. United we stand; divided we fall, and our world needs healing more than ever. Music is a universal language that unifies and speaks directly to the heart. Kristin and I have personally experienced the healing power of music and are devoted to paying that forward and creating more music that heals and inspires all of us to live a full and empowered life.
We all deserve to experience love. And when we feel love, we are likely to share more love in service to others while bringing forth our gifts into greater purpose. But no one can do this alone. We are ALL here to support one another. That's why this project is so important... The more people we can reach and inspire with our music, the more people that could be inspired to heal their wounds. And when we free ourselves (and others) from our wounds, our hearts open, we feel connected to the world around us, and move with more compassion and wisdom. IMAGINE a world where LOVE and KINDNESS motivate us rather than fear; a world working in harmony to uplift and EMPOWER everyone. Welcome to the vision of Bhakti House Band music!
 
 
On top of all our music's healing power, proceeds from ALL our music efforts go to support impoverished children around the world with food, education, and medical care through our Peace Love OM Project.

<h2><strong>BIOGRAPHIE</strong></h2>
<p>Matinda Kamuena n'est pas seulement une jeune demoiselle des Tam Tam du Mont-Royal, mais aussi une auteure-compositrice-interprète de soul-folk-jazz. Née à Kinshasa (République Démocratique du Congo), elle a grandi dans les rythmes de rumba congolaise et les rythmes afro-cubains, avant d’arriver à Montréal comme réfugiée politique. Après avoir bougé de ville en ville, elle développe une facilité à comprendre son entourage et l’applique à ses compositions, qui se font universelles et contagieuses.</p>
<p>En 2013, seulement trois ans après l’achat de sa première guitare, elle se rend à l’étape des duels, lors de la première saison québécoise de La Voix (The Voice). Entretemps, c’est au Cabaret l'Assommoir dans le vieux port de Montréal et le Fibo qu’elle fait ses débuts sur scène.</p>

</div></div>","BIOGRAPHIE
Matinda Kamuena n'est pas seulement une jeune demoiselle des Tam Tam du Mont-Royal, mais aussi une auteure-compositrice-interprète de soul-folk-jazz. Née à Kinshasa (République Démocratique du Congo), elle a grandi dans les rythmes de rumba congolaise et les rythmes afro-cubains, avant d’arriver à Montréal comme réfugiée politique. Après avoir bougé de ville en ville, elle développe une facilité à comprendre son entourage et l’applique à ses compositions, qui se font universelles et contagieuses.
En 2013, seulement trois ans après l’achat de sa première guitare, elle se rend à l’étape des duels, lors de la première saison québécoise de La Voix (The Voice). Entretemps, c’est au Cabaret l'Assommoir dans le vieux port de Montréal et le Fibo qu’elle fait ses débuts sur scène.
S’intéressant à la Soul et aux sons organiques, on arrive parfois à deviner ses influences, allant du Jazz au Post-Rock, Metal-Funk à la Bossa nova. Ses artistes préférés? Yamashita Tatsuro, Sade, Hiromi, Seu Jorge et Jamiroquai. Après la création de son premier single Saw You in My Head (Home), elle continue à exploiter sa créativité rythmique et nous livre des textes beaucoup plus personnels.

<h1><b> Ivan</b></h1>
<p>My music express what's within me, it express how I'm feeling, what I'm thinking and what I believe in. I started playing the drums when I was 11 years old and never stopped since then. As I grew older, I started listening to different type of music and eventually creating my own. Right now, I conceive music as my salvation and my reason to exist so basically; I found my scape through music.</p>

<br/><p>My urge to explore new musical genres and influences is the product of learning to play many different instruments. Even though the drums are my area of expertise, I'm currently improving my guitar, bass and vocal skills. </p>
<p>I grew up on the classic folk and popular music of the 1990's, but started listening to Metallica and other famous metal bands as an little kid in 1996. <br/></p>
<p>As Mtv came to my bedroom TV, bands like System Of A Down, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Korn and Eminem were my childhood soundtrack, as in my teenager years, I was deeply influenced by Dream Theater, Liquid Tension Experiment, Stratovarius and Sepultura. <br/></p>
<p>Those bands woke up my curiosity and early love for music. <br/></p>
<p>Nowadays, I'm not so attached to heavy metal music, given that I absorb daily great bands as Muse, Bumblefoot, Haken, Animals As Leaders, Ayreon Bent Knee, Gentle Giant, Eruca Sativa and Ghost.<br/></p>
<p>The album project reflects how I perceive reality. This project can also be defined as my inner journey throught several emotional processes, but it also has some political references. <br/></p>
<p>""The Locust Speculation"" reflects all of those things and many, many more.</p>
<p>This is my long term dream and I've always wanted to do something like this. I always wanted to take my music to the next level and to take out there, where everyone can enjoy it and relate to it. Even tho I've been in other musical projects during my life, I never had the chance to fully express myself the way I wanted to, we can say that I never could express my own musical vision.</p>
<p>I'm going to be playing the drums, the guitar, the bass and doing some vocals but I will also be getting help from other musicians from my country and all around the world.<br/></p>
<h3>The Investment</h3>
<p>Being able to produce a CD is a really big deal. The studio costs are going through the roof! Plus all the exiting, mixing and mastering costs are really unafordable for me, without even getting started with the album art and the printing of the cd, it is way out of my reach.</p>
<p>So, all the money collected through this campaign will cover the recording and the release of my album. Right now, I need $2.500 to make this posible. <br/></p>
<p>Here's a detailed list of the album expenses:<br/></p>
<p>Recording sessions- $ 1300<br/></p>Artwork- $250<br/><br/>Publishing and Digital Distribution- $70<br/><br/>Cymbals- $300<br/><br/><p>CD - $580</p>
<p>Estimated total - $2500</p>
<p>If for some reason I don't meet my campaign goal, I will put all 
these funds towards the recording process and do what I can to fund the 
rest myself, but for an 8-hour working class uruguayan this will not be easy, that's why i am calling for your contribution.<br/></p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>I'm going to be printing some limited T-shirts with the artwork and posters as part of the rewards, bringing you personally some rewards as many other prizes will be a 
part of the package.</p>
<p>With your help, I hope to get started recording the drums in November and hope 
for a mid December release date.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Spread the word!</h3>

If not it would be greatly appreciated if you could share this campaign with your friends on social media. IndieGoGo makes it easy to do so using their handy share tools.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>Hi, I'm DAVID. I'm SUPER excited
about my new album, BEACON. For years I've written songs for other people
to sing. I've had my songs in movies and TV. Now, with your help, I'm set
to record and release my first album where I sing ALL of my best
songs, my ""Greatest Hits""! </p>
<p>My songs are POSITIVE and UPBEAT. They
are CATCHY and INFECTIOUS, with POWERFUL lyrics and BEAUTIFUL melodies! BEACON includes 12
of my best songs, with FABULOUS full-band arrangements and SOARING vocal
harmonies!</p>

<p>My goal is to raise $26,000. This

initial budget for a website, music video and promotion.</p>
<p>I’ve already recorded and rough
mixed all 12 tracks! This has cost me over $12,000, which is credit card debt
that needs to be paid. Then there is final mixing, mastering, graphic design,
CD production, website design, music video, promotion, etc.</p>

<h3>My name is David Segall</h3>
<p>and I create music with a mission to cultivate peace, share love, and bring forth the heart and soul within each of us. I've been writing, recording and performing for over 12 years. I've toured across the U.S., released three albums and filmed six music videos along the way. With great joy and gratitude, I'm embarking on my first-ever tour of Europe, sharing my music with an international audience and fulfilling a life-long dream. What inspires me most about this journey is having the opportunity to share love through music and to witness people of many cultures light up, as they remember that they too are love and they too have the power to be the change they wish to see in the world! I want to document and share this whole experience, so I've asked my videographer and percussionist friend Ben Cummings to join me on the tour. Together, we want to create a powerful video series to document the journey and share encouraging stories from the soul: stories of walking through fear, embracing Love, and following the direction of our dreams.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to bring this video series and tour to life, Ben and I are aiming to raise $4,800 to cover our costs of:</p>

<p>Ça fait depuis l'âge de 10 ans que je compose la musique en français. Depuis ce temps, j'ai gagné beaucoup d'expérience professionnelle. Voici quelques-unes de mes réussites parmi plusieurs:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Finaliste à La Brunante (concours et formation provinciale pour les auteurs-compositeurs-interprètes) en 2014 et 2016;</li>
<li>Participation au Canadian Songwriter Challenge (projet de collaboration musicale pour les auteurs-compositeurs venant du Nord de l'Ontario) en 2016;</li>
<li>Participation à l'enregistrement du projet iStudio21 (collaboration musicale pour les élèves franco-ontariens) en 2016;</li>
<li>Plusieurs formations pour améliorer ma plume et mes compétences musicales.</li>
</ul>
<div>Après beaucoup de travail et de réflection, j'ai décidé de finalement commencer une nouvelle aventure: l'enregistrement. Je suis très fière de ce que j'ai déjà accomplie dans l'industrie musicale et l'enregistrement est la prochaine étape. Je dois remercier les gens comme vous qui m'appuient et m'encouragent à continuer. Sans vous, ma carrière ne serait pas possible!</div>
<div>_______________________________________________________________________</div>
<div>I have been songwriting since the age of ten. Since then, I have gained a lot of professional experience. Here are a few examples of what I've been able to accomplish:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Finalist of La Brunante (provincial competition and workshop for singer-songwriters) in 2014 and 2016;</li>
<li>Participated in the Canadian Songwriter Challenge (collaborative project for songwriters from Northern Ontario) in 2016;</li>
<li>Participated in the recording of the iStudio21 project (collaborative project for Franco-Ontarian students) in 2016;</li>
<li>Followed several workshops to improve my writing and musical skills.</li>
</ul>
<div>After a lot of work and reflexion, I have decided to finally start off on a new adventure: recording. I am very proud of what I've already been able to accomplish in the musical industry and recording is the next step. I have to acknowledge and thank people like you who support me and encourage me to keep going. Without you, my career wouldn't be possible!</div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Le but ultime / The Ultimate Goal</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Pour mon projet, j'aurais besoin de 1000$. La plupart de cet argent va être utilisé pour financer l'enregistrement de mon EP. Le reste va m'aider à payer pour la production des albums physiques et pour la distribution de mon EP numérique et physique. Si je ne suis pas capable d'atteindre mon but, je vais quand même faire mon enregistrement avec les fonds que j'ai déjà, mais ça va peut-être prendre plus longtemps pour lancer mon album. Il se peut aussi que je ne pourrai pas créer le même montant de copies physiques que je voulais et je vais seulement être capable de créer ceux que vous avez commandés.</div>
<div>Votre appui envers mon projet amènera à des récompenses! Vous pouvez vous procurer une copie de mon EP, soit physique ou numérique, ou même faire partie des gens que je remercie sur ma page Facebook ou sur la pochette! Chaque dollar que vous donnez compte et je veux être capable de vous offrir un beau produit en retour.</div>
<div>_______________________________________________________________________</div>
<div>For my project, I will need $1000. Most of this money will go toward the recording of this EP. The rest of it will help me to pay for the production of the physical albums and for the distribution of the physical and digital albums. If I am not able to reach my goal, I will still record with the existing funds, but it may take longer to release it. It is also possible that I won't be able to create the same amount of physical copies that I wanted and I will only be able to make the amount that people pre-ordered.</div>
<div>Your support towards this project comes with rewards! You will be able to get a copy of my EP (either physical or digital) or even be part of my acknowledgements list on either my Facebook page or on the sleeve! Each dollar that you donate means so much to me and I want to be able to offer you a wonderful product in return.</div>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Parcours musical / Background
Ça fait depuis l'âge de 10 ans que je compose la musique en français. Depuis ce temps, j'ai gagné beaucoup d'expérience professionnelle. Voici quelques-unes de mes réussites parmi plusieurs:


Finaliste à La Brunante (concours et formation provinciale pour les auteurs-compositeurs-interprètes) en 2014 et 2016;
Participation au Canadian Songwriter Challenge (projet de collaboration musicale pour les auteurs-compositeurs venant du Nord de l'Ontario) en 2016;
Participation à l'enregistrement du projet iStudio21 (collaboration musicale pour les élèves franco-ontariens) en 2016;
Plusieurs formations pour améliorer ma plume et mes compétences musicales.

Après beaucoup de travail et de réflection, j'ai décidé de finalement commencer une nouvelle aventure: l'enregistrement. Je suis très fière de ce que j'ai déjà accomplie dans l'industrie musicale et l'enregistrement est la prochaine étape. Je dois remercier les gens comme vous qui m'appuient et m'encouragent à continuer. Sans vous, ma carrière ne serait pas possible!
_______________________________________________________________________
I have been songwriting since the age of ten. Since then, I have gained a lot of professional experience. Here are a few examples of what I've been able to accomplish:


Finalist of La Brunante (provincial competition and workshop for singer-songwriters) in 2014 and 2016;
Participated in the Canadian Songwriter Challenge (collaborative project for songwriters from Northern Ontario) in 2016;
Participated in the recording of the iStudio21 project (collaborative project for Franco-Ontarian students) in 2016;
Followed several workshops to improve my writing and musical skills.

After a lot of work and reflexion, I have decided to finally start off on a new adventure: recording. I am very proud of what I've already been able to accomplish in the musical industry and recording is the next step. I have to acknowledge and thank people like you who support me and encourage me to keep going. Without you, my career wouldn't be possible!
   Le but ultime / The Ultimate Goal
 
Pour mon projet, j'aurais besoin de 1000$. La plupart de cet argent va être utilisé pour financer l'enregistrement de mon EP. Le reste va m'aider à payer pour la production des albums physiques et pour la distribution de mon EP numérique et physique. Si je ne suis pas capable d'atteindre mon but, je vais quand même faire mon enregistrement avec les fonds que j'ai déjà, mais ça va peut-être prendre plus longtemps pour lancer mon album. Il se peut aussi que je ne pourrai pas créer le même montant de copies physiques que je voulais et je vais seulement être capable de créer ceux que vous avez commandés.
Votre appui envers mon projet amènera à des récompenses! Vous pouvez vous procurer une copie de mon EP, soit physique ou numérique, ou même faire partie des gens que je remercie sur ma page Facebook ou sur la pochette! Chaque dollar que vous donnez compte et je veux être capable de vous offrir un beau produit en retour.
_______________________________________________________________________
For my project, I will need $1000. Most of this money will go toward the recording of this EP. The rest of it will help me to pay for the production of the physical albums and for the distribution of the physical and digital albums. If I am not able to reach my goal, I will still record with the existing funds, but it may take longer to release it. It is also possible that I won't be able to create the same amount of physical copies that I wanted and I will only be able to make the amount that people pre-ordered.
Your support towards this project comes with rewards! You will be able to get a copy of my EP (either physical or digital) or even be part of my acknowledgements list on either my Facebook page or on the sleeve! Each dollar that you donate means so much to me and I want to be able to offer you a wonderful product in return.

    Votre appui est clé! / Your Support is Key!

<h3>Composer Jeffrey Nytch </h3>
<p>Jeffrey Nytch is an accomplished composer whose works have been performed throughout the U.S. and Europe by leading artists including Richard Stoltzman, The Ahn Trio, New York Chamber Symphony, Seattle Symphony, National Repertory Orchestra, Moravian Philharmonic, and many others. Jeff's music is expressive, lyrical, and spiritual; he creates meaningful connections with his audience through a musical voice that is engaging and approachable. This violin concerto project, celebrating the heroism and life of Hungarian violinist Sándor Fehér, gives him the opportunity to tell a unique and poignant musical story to audiences across the country. Our orchestral partners include the Mission Chamber Orchestra (San Jose, CA), the Pro Musica Colorado Chamber Orchestra (greater Denver), Dallas Chamber Symphony (Texas), and the Chamber Orchestra of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need ... and Incentives for You!</h3>
<p>This campaign will have multiple funding milestones representing a progressively greater realization of our project. At the $20,000 level, the commission is fully-funded. Professional engraving of the score and preparation of the parts is possible at $25,000. At $40,000 soloist fees for our partner orchestras will be covered, meaning that their costs of performing the concerto will be completely met, with no additional funding required on their part. And at $60,000 we will be able to produce a studio-quality recording of the work.</p>
<p><strong><i>Incentives include (at the $1,000+ level) membership in the ""Budapest Travel Club,"" a personalized trip-planning service to one of Europe's greatest cities. And at the $10,000 level, you'll receive</i></strong><i><strong> a unique, custom-designed, handmade piece of jewelry from the award-winning West &amp; Company jewelers.</strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Composer Jeffrey Nytch has a long track record of important projects that have reached broad and diverse audiences. His <i>Symphony No. 1: Formations</i>, co-commissioned by the Boulder Philharmonic and the Geological Society of America, has generated international press and brought geoscientists and nature enthusiasts to concert halls throughout the mountain west. His string quartet, <i>Fantasy on Icarus</i>, will have its premiere in January, 2017, at Carnegie Hall's Weil Recital Hall. <i>Concerto for Violin: Costa Concordia</i> will bring a compelling story to the audiences of our orchestra partners, as well as engage the Hungarian community through celebrating a national hero. In addition to our current orchestra partners, we believe this work will stimulate additional performances throughout the United States and (ultimately) in Hungary itself. Building on the recent successes of his Symphony and String Quartet, the concerto project will represent a major move forward Jeffrey Nytch and his work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk/challenge with this project will be raising sufficient funds to not only fund the commission but address production costs for our orchestra partners. Without our partners, the concerto cannot be performed. We believe the compelling nature of the story, the strength of our partnering organizations, and the enthusiasm of the American-Hungarian community (with whom we have many connections) we can meet this challenge successfully.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If a financial contribution is not possible, please help us by spreading the word about this project! If you live in San Jose, Dallas, Denver, or Pittsburgh, contact our orchestra partners and see how you can help them share this project with their patrons. You can make a tremendous contribution through your efforts!<br/><br/><strong><i>Thank you for your support!</i></strong></p>

<p>The Society Of NEw MUsic Sarajevo - SONEMUS (Lat. - ""let us sound"") was established in 2001 in order to perform, promote and educate in the domain of contemporary artistic music. Being the only ensemble for contemporary music in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, SONEMUS attracts a huge audience, music students as well as the general public at their concerts and lectures.</p>
<p>The ensemble members are musicians based in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina,  Switzerland, Germany, France, Slovenia and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Our wish is to present the biggest musical achievements of the 20th and 21st century to the Bosnian-Herzegovinian audience, where contemporary music still has a status of an almost exotic and unknown genre of classical music. <strong>We offer all of our concerts with no admission.</strong> </p>
<p>In the past projects, we performed a various number of contemporary music ""classics"" (Schönberg's <i>Pierrot Lunaire</i>,  Romitelli's <i>Professor Bad Trip</i>, Grisey's <i>Vortex Temporum</i>, Ligeti's <i>Chamber concerto</i> amongst many others - all of them PREMIERE performances in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina) as well as new works and premieres by young local and international composers. Our work in the field of contemporary music is always very appreciated in the local and regional scene, which can be seen by the sheer number of audience we get at every concert of the festival.</p>

<p>For our next edition, we will once again premiere new compositions, this time by Swiss composer <strong>Antoine Fachard</strong> and Bosnian composer <strong>Ališer Sijarić</strong>. Also, the SONEMUS ensemble will perform <strong>Brian Ferneyhough’s <i>La Chute d’ Icare</i></strong> and <strong>Richard Barrett’s <i>Trawl</i></strong>, for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Composers Ališer Sijarić, Antoine Fachard and Richard Barrett will hold <strong>workshops for young composers</strong> at the Ars Aevi Museum for contemporary art.</p>
<p>In addition to two world premieres and two Bosnian premieres, the members of the SONEMUS ensemble also want to focus on working with music students in Sarajevo. As part of the SONEMUS Fest 2018, we organise <strong>workshops for instrumentalists</strong> at the Music academy Sarajevo.

<p>Darol and Emy here. As many of you know, we love making music together and we love getting the younger members of our far-reaching music community in on it.</p>
<p>Anyone who’s looking at this probably knows me, Darol. I’ve been making music with other great musicians since 1976, with the David Grisman Quintet, Turtle Island, The Montreux Band, (Windham Hill) Psychograss, and my Republic Of Strings band.</p>
<p>In the eight years Emy &amp; I have worked together, we've played about two hundred concerts in the US, Ireland, Australia and Spain,  we've produced three full-length CDs and and five themed shows-a winter holiday show, a Valentines' show, an orchestra show, a tribute to Guy Clark, as well as gobs of Emy's original songs and my Republic Of Strings-type shows… <strong>and</strong>…</p>
<p><i>this next thing.</i></p>
<p><strong>We have been working for the last 4 years on a monumental project for which, we, <i>for the very first time</i>, are asking for financial support.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have completed our first collection of Sixties and early Seventies songs.</strong></p>
<p>Because of the iconic nature of this stuff, and the fact that it has been <i>50 YEARS</i> since much of this music got written, <i>we</i> now think of it as folk music… even though we’ll be paying lots of well-deserved publishing royalties.</p>
<p>Much of that music has shaped most of the generations since then, and that period established styles that artists still create in. That’s why we’re calling the project</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>“Music Of Our People”.</strong> </p>
<p>Out of the hundreds, maybe thousands, of great, significant songs that appeared during that time, these are the ones that presented themselves to us. We are using our unique viewpoints and skills to re-create these songs in the New Acoustic style that I helped invent, and is a big part of Americana-style music. The Songs are:</p>
<p><strong><i>Up On The Roof  </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>These Boots (Were Made for Walkin’)</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>The Wichita Lineman</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Stone Soul Picnic</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Killin' The Blues </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Tattler/I Think it’s Going To Be All Right</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>You Keep Me Hangin' On</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Stoney End</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Ripple</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Uncle John's Band</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Bird On A Wire </i></strong></p>
<p><i>                                                      …right?</i>  Yeah. incredible.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:-4.5pt;"">As many of you know, I’m not unfamiliar with projects like this. I’ve done many panoramic sonic fiddling projects, and released a folk music album of highly arranged material called “Heritage” featuring Wille Nelson, Mavis Staples, Bela Fleck, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Tim O’Brien, Paul McCandless, David Lindley, Edgar Meyer, Victor Wooten and on and on. And my Republic Of Strings project used a number of songs from this era.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:-4.5pt;"">We'll be</p>
<p>This entire project was recorded piece by piece in our attic, sometimes with up to three people at once, sometimes with live vocals, painstakingly assembled after much thought, built up from a rocking basic track of guitar and octave mandolin with bass. My home recording studio combines legacy gear from 25 years ago with the most recent digital technology, and is quirky; but the best tool is the tool you know, and I have made a dozen albums on this system, gradually upgrading and changing out gear. I know exactly how I want it to sound, and I can make it happen… for not a lot of expense, generally. We did pay the other musicians about twice the going recording rate, which is still kind of a pittance.</p>
<p>Many of these folks were not alive yet when this music was created! — but they are pretty much geniuses, and contributed beautiful insight to these songs. You can find more info about these players at my website, <a href=""http://darolanger.com/index.php?page=about&amp;family=projects&amp;display=577"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">darolanger.com.</a></p>

<p> </p>
<p>As you can well imagine, this part is the hardest part; asking for funding of any sort pretty much gives me a rash, and I don’t know anyone who enjoys doing it. In the distant dim past, a record company would invest in the project and fund production, and they would be paid back through sales. Recently, I’ve been able to fund my own releases all the way from basic tracks through the release; I invested in recording gear and have a nice space to make the record.</p>
<p>This time is a bit different.</p>
<p>As usual, I’ve already funded my own production here, to the tune of about <strong>$6k</strong> spread out over the 4 years.</p>
<p><strong>But we want to spend more, about $9500, for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The highest quality mastering,</li>
<li>make great<strong> <a href=""https://youtu.be/K1K3GEuKInY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CD art</a></strong>,</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://youtu.be/K1K3GEuKInY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Manufacturing a great package</a>,</li>
<li>We want to reach out to people our age who might not be reachable through Instagram or Reddit or whatever folks are using these days.</li>
<li>Hire real promotion, working with an experienced pro, running ads and getting articles printed in AARP Magazine, reaching out to all the NPR affiliates and our friends in community radio, and the various Americana and Folk Associations all over the US and Canada;</li>
<li>Spend time and energy reaching out to our large network of industry people and fellow musicians, and perhaps even a bit of tour support for playing this music out on radio and concerts (plane flights, van rental, and hiring the best musicians).</li>
<li>Paying the <strong>PUBLISHING ROYALTIES</strong>, which get paid in advance, according to how many recordings are manufactured!</li>
<li><p>The <strong><i>taxes</i></strong> we’ll pay on the money you give us. This is a big thing! Nice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I know we are all giving to various tax-deductible and other Non-Governmental Organizations like crazy now, in these outrageous, incredible, and dangerous times.</p>

</div></div>","Darol and Emy here. As many of you know, we love making music together and we love getting the younger members of our far-reaching music community in on it.
Anyone who’s looking at this probably knows me, Darol. I’ve been making music with other great musicians since 1976, with the David Grisman Quintet, Turtle Island, The Montreux Band, (Windham Hill) Psychograss, and my Republic Of Strings band.
In the eight years Emy & I have worked together, we've played about two hundred concerts in the US, Ireland, Australia and Spain,  we've produced three full-length CDs and and five themed shows-a winter holiday show, a Valentines' show, an orchestra show, a tribute to Guy Clark, as well as gobs of Emy's original songs and my Republic Of Strings-type shows… and…
this next thing.
We have been working for the last 4 years on a monumental project for which, we, for the very first time, are asking for financial support.
We have completed our first collection of Sixties and early Seventies songs.
Because of the iconic nature of this stuff, and the fact that it has been 50 YEARS since much of this music got written, we now think of it as folk music… even though we’ll be paying lots of well-deserved publishing royalties.
Much of that music has shaped most of the generations since then, and that period established styles that artists still create in. That’s why we’re calling the project
“Music Of Our People”. 
Out of the hundreds, maybe thousands, of great, significant songs that appeared during that time, these are the ones that presented themselves to us. We are using our unique viewpoints and skills to re-create these songs in the New Acoustic style that I helped invent, and is a big part of Americana-style music. The Songs are:
Up On The Roof  
These Boots (Were Made for Walkin’)
The Wichita Lineman
Stone Soul Picnic
Killin' The Blues 
Tattler/I Think it’s Going To Be All Right
You Keep Me Hangin' On
Stoney End
Ripple
Uncle John's Band
Bird On A Wire 
                                                      …right?  Yeah. incredible.
As many of you know, I’m not unfamiliar with projects like this. I’ve done many panoramic sonic fiddling projects, and released a folk music album of highly arranged material called “Heritage” featuring Wille Nelson, Mavis Staples, Bela Fleck, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Tim O’Brien, Paul McCandless, David Lindley, Edgar Meyer, Victor Wooten and on and on. And my Republic Of Strings project used a number of songs from this era.
We'll be
This entire project was recorded piece by piece in our attic, sometimes with up to three people at once, sometimes with live vocals, painstakingly assembled after much thought, built up from a rocking basic track of guitar and octave mandolin with bass. My home recording studio combines legacy gear from 25 years ago with the most recent digital technology, and is quirky; but the best tool is the tool you know, and I have made a dozen albums on this system, gradually upgrading and changing out gear. I know exactly how I want it to sound, and I can make it happen… for not a lot of expense, generally. We did pay the other musicians about twice the going recording rate, which is still kind of a pittance.
Many of these folks were not alive yet when this music was created! — but they are pretty much geniuses, and contributed beautiful insight to these songs. You can find more info about these players at my website, darolanger.com.

 
As you can well imagine, this part is the hardest part; asking for funding of any sort pretty much gives me a rash, and I don’t know anyone who enjoys doing it. In the distant dim past, a record company would invest in the project and fund production, and they would be paid back through sales. Recently, I’ve been able to fund my own releases all the way from basic tracks through the release; I invested in recording gear and have a nice space to make the record.
This time is a bit different.
As usual, I’ve already funded my own production here, to the tune of about $6k spread out over the 4 years.
But we want to spend more, about $9500, for:

The highest quality mastering,
make great CD art,

Manufacturing a great package,
We want to reach out to people our age who might not be reachable through Instagram or Reddit or whatever folks are using these days.
Hire real promotion, working with an experienced pro, running ads and getting articles printed in AARP Magazine, reaching out to all the NPR affiliates and our friends in community radio, and the various Americana and Folk Associations all over the US and Canada;
Spend time and energy reaching out to our large network of industry people and fellow musicians, and perhaps even a bit of tour support for playing this music out on radio and concerts (plane flights, van rental, and hiring the best musicians).
Paying the PUBLISHING ROYALTIES, which get paid in advance, according to how many recordings are manufactured!
The taxes we’ll pay on the money you give us. This is a big thing! Nice.

I know we are all giving to various tax-deductible and other Non-Governmental Organizations like crazy now, in these outrageous, incredible, and dangerous times.
BUT This music has already seen us through a time of great discord and upheaval and maintains its integrity and relevance right now.
So. We’re asking you to make an additional investment in yourself: In your daily happiness and the relief that great music can bring… A gift that keeps on giving. 
Any amount is appreciated! Anything in the neighborhood of $25 will obviously get you your CD signed sealed & delivered, its yours…
For those of you who can give more, we can figure out stuff such as the usual platter of musically-oriented exchange bonuses.
Higher-resolution files of the music,
our secret recipes,
Extra songs or outtakes, alternate mixes with different combos of instruments.  The stripped-down mixes are amazing as well, and groove like gangbusters.
We will record your voice on our answering machine.
T-shirts (more $$, right?)
free hikes in the woods,
meet you for coffee in Glocca Morra, Bora Bora, The Roman Agora. Whatever.
If you don't have money for this--
if you just have ideas, want to help, could publicize or promote through your Facebook page or use the wonderful Indiegogo share tools--
or are interested in this whole process and have knowledge that would be useful,
we want to hear from you!

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, we’re Spoiler.  We are a Toronto-based skate-punk band that started in 2014. Over the course of our 4 years together we have assembled a blistering collection of 12 recordings, spanning 3 EPs (small albums).</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to release our cumulative collection of songs as a complete album project on vinyl.  For this album, 2 of our EPs have been remixed and remastered (S/T and ‘Starting with S’) and we have recorded EP’s worth of new material in 2017 to complete a record’s worth of material, totaling 12 songs, that we intend to release early into 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>
<p>Being fans of vinyl ourselves, we know how much people enjoy collecting punk records on wax.  For that reason, we just HAVE to press this record.  We believe it’s a must-have for existing fans of the band and of punk rock on the whole. For new fans, friends and family, let this album serve as testament and keepsake that highlights the passion that all of the band members share for punk rock and the commitment required from us to produce an album of this caliber.  Your contributions will help us fund the recording and engineering process and, most importantly, the manufacturing of the records.  We can’t afford it!</p>
<p><strong>Numbers:</strong></p>
<p>How much do we need?  We need $3000.00 CAD.  We’ve shopped around a lot of manufacturers and $2200 is going to pay for the vinyl manufacturing here in Canada, while the remaining $800 will be split amongst band members - $160.00 to each of the 5 of us – to cover part of the recording costs that we’ve already fronted.  We are making 200 records.  The price difference from 100 to 200 copies is negligible, so it makes the most sense to press 200 copies.  Your cost per album will be $16 (plus shipping if need-be).</p>
<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The self-titled Spoiler album will be pressed on translucent vinyl with beautiful new artwork printed on a high-quality jacket. The press will also include a lyrics insert and a favourite band photo; the same photo included in our profile here.</p>
<p>A lot of hard work and woodshedding went into writing and developing these songs in the band’s practice space and through live performances around southern Ontario. All the songs were professionally recorded by the best punk rock engineer and producer in Toronto – Steve Rizun of Drive Studios.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the album is cumulative in that it is a collection of 3 separate EP projects recorded over the span of 3 years, all of which have been mixed and mastered together to bring them new life as a complete project.</p>
<p>This killer punk LP is a must-have for existing fans of the band and of punk rock on the whole. For new fans, friends and family, let this album serve as testament and amazing keepsake that highlights the passion that all of the band members share for punk rock and the commitment required to produce an album of this caliber.</p>

<p>Chers amis, chère famille,</p>
<p>Depuis plusieurs années, des chansons,  compagnes de ma vie,  ont fleuri. <br/>Elles sont maintenant prêtes, corolles ouvertes et dansantes aux quatre vents. Ainsi elles iront leur petit bonhomme de ciel bleu chatouiller, bercer, nourrir, enflammer le cœur et les oreilles de ceux et de celles pour qui elles ont vu le jour ! <br/>Et oui, elles sont là, patientes, vastes, vibrantes, fragiles et belles: ces chansons coulées de sources vives, de braises chaudes, ce pain de tous les jours, ces chansons nées au ventre des forêts d’ici et de là-bas, ces chansons de la première aube, de la rosée, aux ailes de soleil, ces chansons sœurs des lunes, écho de mes ancêtres, ces chansons nacre des mers, perle des mères, ces chansons chevauchées folles ivres amoureuses sauvages, ces chansons azur du désert, de feuilles au vent et de fenêtres ouvertes… elles me traversent et s’offrent enfin à vous, en une forme donnée, elles osent la complétion !</p>
<p>Ainsi se déploiera ce tout premier album, entre les teintes intimistes de mes compositions en français, les chaudes et vives envolées d’âme de mes chants en anglais et les éclatantes célébrations du vivant en espagnol et en portugais !</p>
<p>Je suis émue devant l’inépuisable bonté de la vie qui me répond au quart de tour en révélant joyeusement sur le chemin des alliés d’exceptions !</p>

<p>For several years, songs, companions of my life, have flourished.<br/>They are now ready, open and dancing to the four winds. So they spread their wings, rocking, feeding, igniting the hearts and ears of those for whom they were born! <br/>And yes, they are there, patient, vast, vibrant, fragile and beautiful: songs poured from living sources, this bread of days, these songs born in the belly of the forests of here and over there, those songs of the first dawn, the dew, with the wings of the sun, these songs sisters of the moons, echo of my ancestors, these mother-of-pearl songs, these wild crazy drunken horses songs, these blue songs of the desert, of leaves in the wind and of open windows ... they run through me and finally offer themselves to you, in a given form, they dare the completion!</p>
<p>Thus will unfold this very first album, between the intimate shades of my compositions in French, the warm and lively flights of soul of my songs in English and the vibrant celebrations of life in Spanish and Portuguese!</p>

Chers amis, chère famille,
Depuis plusieurs années, des chansons,  compagnes de ma vie,  ont fleuri. Elles sont maintenant prêtes, corolles ouvertes et dansantes aux quatre vents. Ainsi elles iront leur petit bonhomme de ciel bleu chatouiller, bercer, nourrir, enflammer le cœur et les oreilles de ceux et de celles pour qui elles ont vu le jour ! Et oui, elles sont là, patientes, vastes, vibrantes, fragiles et belles: ces chansons coulées de sources vives, de braises chaudes, ce pain de tous les jours, ces chansons nées au ventre des forêts d’ici et de là-bas, ces chansons de la première aube, de la rosée, aux ailes de soleil, ces chansons sœurs des lunes, écho de mes ancêtres, ces chansons nacre des mers, perle des mères, ces chansons chevauchées folles ivres amoureuses sauvages, ces chansons azur du désert, de feuilles au vent et de fenêtres ouvertes… elles me traversent et s’offrent enfin à vous, en une forme donnée, elles osent la complétion !
Ainsi se déploiera ce tout premier album, entre les teintes intimistes de mes compositions en français, les chaudes et vives envolées d’âme de mes chants en anglais et les éclatantes célébrations du vivant en espagnol et en portugais !
Je suis émue devant l’inépuisable bonté de la vie qui me répond au quart de tour en révélant joyeusement sur le chemin des alliés d’exceptions !
Toute ma gratitude à l’amitié tissant la trame de l’offrande à venir :
Laurent Calembert, frère des évidences, complice des étoiles, multi-instrumentiste aux accents électro et mixeur inspiré !
Étienne Babin (Ennyam), allié précieux de source claire, me révélant un peu plus à chaque note pleine, vibrante et sensible de son piano !
Éric Violette, maestro du son à l’oreille affutée, musicien joueur dans l’âme à la créativité débordante et à l’enthousiasme contagieux !
Sacha Thomas, homme solaire de ma vie, me soutenant sur tous les plans au rythme de son cœur généreux, de ses tambours merveilleux et de sa magie bruissant au cœur de ses instruments inusités !
Ainsi qu’aux alliés à venir, percussionniste, violoniste, flûtiste qui se joindront prochainement au voyage, plus d’un seront invités à plonger en sa créativité ! C’est un des précieux joyaux d’une telle entreprise : le fleurissement de ceux qui nous entourent ! C’est tout simplement vivifiant pour tous !

<h3>A Bit About Me..</h3>
<p>About 5 years ago, after a dramatic shift in my life and with the guidance of a spiritual leader (Satguru Sri Ramana Devi) I decided to make music my life's path. From then on, armed with my acoustic guitar and a stomp box, I began gigging as much as I could. With perseverance and a great deal of support, I've witnessed a steady progression. My songs have received national radio airplay, I have won regional awards and last year I signed a record deal with the independent label - 'Kidda Records'.<br/>I want to make people happy through music. It was always my vision to have a big soulful sound so last year, starting small (with my bassist in a freezing shed at the back of a pub), I went about working towards this goal. I am now truly grateful to have a team of incredibly talented musicians around me to bring my songs to life and help spread my message.<br/>Now we want to get out there. We're itching to travel and perform as much as possible especially with a new EP due for release in May. In my years spent playing solo, getting around in my little old car was easy. Now, with 6 of us and a whole load of gear, the gigs we've played have been problematic to say the least and a tour is out of the question. The only way we can move forwards is to get a BAND VAN... and that's where you come in, should you choose to support our cause!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Low Down...</h3>
<p>We aren't the wealthiest collection of individuals. 2 of us are still students and I manage to earn enough from music to sustain my own life and my little Renault Clio, but funding a van with insurance costs etc. is something we are unable to do alone. If you make a contribution you will be enabling us to take a crucial 'next step' as a band.<br/>Here is a step by step breakdown of where your money will go if we hit our target.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>£5,000 budget for the Van itself</strong> - I have extensively researched the prices of second hand crew vans that fit our requirements and have relatively low mileage. 'LDV Maxus', 'Ford Transit' and 'Renault Trafic' are the kind of models we are aiming for. Obviously we will have to adapt to what is available on the market at the time of purchase.<br/> </li>
<li> <strong>£1,000 for promotional graphics</strong> - one of the most effective means of advertising is to drive around in your brand! On the road, the van will be exposed to thousands of people every day. We therefore plan to utilize our van's potential in this way! This figure is based on estimated quotes from providers based on the approximate size of the Van we will buy.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>£1,950 for 1 years van insurance + breakdown cover</strong> - although I have no points or convictions, due to my age (23) Van insurance is very expensive but is obviously a necessity. Also, forking out hundreds of pounds to have the Van recovered should it breakdown on tour is something none of us have the means to do!</li>
<li>
<strong>£500 for Indiegogo fees </strong>- this is to cover the Indiegogo charge of 5% for their assistance in the campaign plus additional transaction fees.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>If by some miracle we manage to go over our target, or find a quality van at a price below our van budget, a portion of the money will be placed in an 'emergency van kitty' to be used for servicing and maintenance to make sure we can get around and play music for all you lovely people. <br/>I am also currently fundraising for the various projects (music videos, merchandise, CD's, recording etc) that we have planned for this year, for which we will need somewhere in the region of £5,000. Any left over money from this crowdfunder will be invested straight back into releasing more content for you!<br/>If we are not able to reach our full target, we will prioritize buying a Van and insurance and work towards having graphics printed at a later date. Whatever happens, we will get out on the road somehow!</p>
<h3>
<br/>What you get back</h3>
<p>We have loads of really cool incentives on offer to say thank you for helping us in our van quest, including signed CD's, music lessons, living room gigs and a private full band show! Check out everything that we have on offer in the 'PERKS' section to your right &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Your help really is incredibly important at this stage in our musical journey and we are extremely grateful for any contribution you wish to make.</p>
<h3>
<br/>The Impact of your generosity?</h3>
<p>You have the power to make us mobile! Having effective transport is fundamentally important in the process of touring, and touring is an essential aspect of a career in music. This is exactly what we aim to be doing in the coming months and years across the UK, Europe and further afield. On a practical level, the success of the project for us will mean we can readily get ourselves performing in venues across towns and cities for you guys, wherever you may be. It also means we'll have access to one of the most widely used and effective promotion methods to get thousands of commuters up and down the M6 looking up 'JOHN DHALI'!</p>
<p>Above and beyond our personal growth in success, I do have a broader goal in my heart. Music can undoubtedly be a catalyst for positive change. It has been used for millennia to bring people together, for ritual worship and healing, and to ignite social change. I want to use music for a higher purpose. I want people to leave our gigs inspired to become a better version of themselves. Change happens first on an individual level, then at a collective level. I feel it is my duty to serve people in this way. I am determined and driven to see a world where Self-Realization is a normal part of western life and we are being the kind and compassionate people we were born to be. The way to do this on my part is to bring this philosophy into popular culture through music. The next chapter in the story is getting a VAN...please help!</p>
<h3>
<br/>You can help in lots of ways...</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to make a donation but would still like to support, then please spread the word about our cause! Share the campaign with the Indiegogo share tools on social media, tell your family, friends and colleagues, invite us to play a gig in your local area or get us in for an interview at your local radio station. Whatever it is you can do - it will play a part in helping us achieve our goal!<br/><br/><strong>We hope to see you soon in our new BAND VAN! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you and lots of love to you</strong> </p>

<h3>What are we doing?</h3>
<p>Yonge Guns began in 2013 with ideals of competing in the Collegiate Barbershop Quartet Contest. To say we'd be planning a CD and a trip overseas in 5 years would have been ludicrous, but here we are.</p>
<p>We have spent 5 years building a repertoire and an identity that is unique and true to us. Our CD, <i>Show Some Love</i>, is an opportunity to capture that ever developing identity, to take a snapshot of who we are in 2018. The 12 songs that will appear on this CD are exactly that. <strong>They encompass every story we've told, every laugh we've had, and every emotion we've felt</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>My Lady Loves To Dance (Dean Martin Cover)</i></li>
<li><i>History (One Direction Cover)</i></li>
<li><i>Secondhand White Baby Grand (from SMASH)</i></li>
<li><i>I'm A Train (King's Singers Cover)</i></li>
<li><i>All My Life (K-Ci &amp; JoJo Cover)</i></li>
<li><i>I Could Be Happy With You (from Boyfriend)</i></li>
<li><i>Canadian Girls (Dean Brody Cover)</i></li>
<li><i>When I Look At You (from The Scarlet Pimpernel)</i></li>
<li><i>God, I Hate Shakespeare (from Something Rotten!)</i></li>
<li><i>Show Some Love (original song by Reuven Grajner)</i></li>
<li><i>Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story (from Hamilton)</i></li>
<li><i>Hideaway (Jacob Collier Cover)</i></li>
</ol>
<p>Never one to shy away from a challenge, we are also embarking on an <strong>11,000 km round trip journey to Edinburgh, Scotland </strong>to perform at the world famous <a href=""https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/all-in-sing-like-nobody-s-listening"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a>. The Fringe is the world's largest arts festival, hosting 3,398 shows and selling 2,696,884 tickets for the 2017 iteration. Our 1-week run will be an experience like no other we could have dreamed of and we are beyond excited to begin.</p>
<p>But none of that would have been, nor will be, possible without the immense generosity and support of the people we love and the people who have graced us with their attendance at our shows and contests. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What can you do?</h3>

</div></div>","What are we doing?
Yonge Guns began in 2013 with ideals of competing in the Collegiate Barbershop Quartet Contest. To say we'd be planning a CD and a trip overseas in 5 years would have been ludicrous, but here we are.
We have spent 5 years building a repertoire and an identity that is unique and true to us. Our CD, Show Some Love, is an opportunity to capture that ever developing identity, to take a snapshot of who we are in 2018. The 12 songs that will appear on this CD are exactly that. They encompass every story we've told, every laugh we've had, and every emotion we've felt.

My Lady Loves To Dance (Dean Martin Cover)
History (One Direction Cover)
Secondhand White Baby Grand (from SMASH)
I'm A Train (King's Singers Cover)
All My Life (K-Ci & JoJo Cover)
I Could Be Happy With You (from Boyfriend)
Canadian Girls (Dean Brody Cover)
When I Look At You (from The Scarlet Pimpernel)
God, I Hate Shakespeare (from Something Rotten!)
Show Some Love (original song by Reuven Grajner)
Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story (from Hamilton)
Hideaway (Jacob Collier Cover)

Never one to shy away from a challenge, we are also embarking on an 11,000 km round trip journey to Edinburgh, Scotland to perform at the world famous Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The Fringe is the world's largest arts festival, hosting 3,398 shows and selling 2,696,884 tickets for the 2017 iteration. Our 1-week run will be an experience like no other we could have dreamed of and we are beyond excited to begin.
But none of that would have been, nor will be, possible without the immense generosity and support of the people we love and the people who have graced us with their attendance at our shows and contests. 

What can you do?
Needless to say nothing in life is free, and we aren't quite Pentatonix just yet. We're hoping to raise $5000, a small portion of our total costs, to relieve the pressure of these projects.
Each dollar raised will go towards offsetting everything from flights and accommodation in Edinburgh to our amazing album artwork being done by Kim Sison and CD production being done by Dylan Bell. We want to make these endeavours the most successful they can be in order to spread the joy of music worldwide.
We have some incredible perk packages available to those who donate, including limited edition options only available through this campaign. If not for the merchandise, we implore you to donate for the love of music and all who share it!

Rick is a top-quality builder and specialises in soundproofing, and along with my expertise in recording and production we designed the studios and started construction — everything was powering along and we could see the finish line getting closer.</p><p>Then in March 2020, the pandemic hit, and the performing arts and live music industry were decimated globally. Along with so many other artists, I lost my entire year’s work and income. Rick continued to fund construction by working on other building projects, but this became unsustainable.</p><div>

I’ve been a professional drummer since the age of 13 and have been fortunate to play with many fantastic bands and artists, including Amy Winehouse, Adele, Incognito, Chaka Khan and the band I play with now, Level 42, as well as fronting my own band PB Underground.With my best friend and business partner, Rick Green, we’re building a creative hub of 15 superbly designed recording studios with live/control rooms and production suites with and without vocal booths, situated in a creative hub in Watford, North London. The studios range from 110 sqf to 350 sqf and are tailored for Producers, Songwriters, Composers, Artists, Musicians, Mix & Mastering Engineers, Programmers, TV Editors and Voiceovers.What We Need To Complete The StudiosWe identified the lack of affordable, quality designed, purpose-built recording studios and production suites as a major hurdle for musicians and artists looking for creative space to work.So in 2019, we put our life savings into building Track 23 Studios. Rick is a top-quality builder and specialises in soundproofing, and along with my expertise in recording and production we designed the studios and started construction — everything was powering along and we could see the finish line getting closer.Then in March 2020, the pandemic hit, and the performing arts and live music industry were decimated globally. Along with so many other artists, I lost my entire year’s work and income. Rick continued to fund construction by working on other building projects, but this became unsustainable.
 We’re still paying rent but construction has stalled, so we desperately need your help to get these studios completed, not only so we can start covering the rent, but also provide much needed creative spaces to help get the musicians, mixers and producers back doing what they do best.We are down to the last of our finances, having received an initial investment of £150k and pouring our life savings into the pot as well. We need your help to raise a final £65k so we can complete construction and open the studios in May 2021.What You Get For Supporting UsWe have an exciting list of perks and incentives to say thank you for supporting us.I'm putting up my time as a drum instructor to offer one-on-one sessions with musicians who can benefit from my skills and experience not just as a drummer, but as a mentor to those looking for a career in the music industry through to hard-core professionals who want to further hone their drumming craft. I'm also offering to play on your own track.Rick will also be putting up his time as an expert consultant for constructing studios both large and small, and even soundproofing projects for both domestic and commercial use.I'm also really excited to announce that I will be soon opening my own online music academy, so you can learn drumming from the very basics all the way through to the very best skills and techniques that have been the foundation of my own career.We will be offering advance subscriptions to these online courses so when it's launched you will be the very first ones to enrol and learn from me directly.And how's for the wow factor! We're offering a Co-Production credit on the next PB Underground album, a private gig by PB Underground,  and the once in a lifetime opportunity to feature your own track as a hidden bonus on the next PBUG album!
 We're also offering heavily discounted corporate sponsorship deals to have your brand presence at the Track23 Studios.The ImpactThe arts and music industries have been decimated, live performances have been cancelled indefinitely, stopping us from doing what we love and are great at. It’s because of this that Track23 Studios is an even more important project to create an affordable space for musicians and producers.While we don’t know how long this pandemic will last, the one thing we can do to make a positive and lasting contribution to the arts and music sector is to finish the construction of the studios to provide musicians and producers with a badly needed creative hub that is built for purpose, affordable and perfectly designed through my own experience as an accomplished musician and Rick as a top-quality construction contractor.Where The Funds Will GoEvery penny we receive will go towards completing construction on the studios, nearly all of it earmarked for construction materials and the fit-out of the studios to a completed and bookable state so we can start earning income from the project to ensure it's a self-sustaining and enduring resource for the music sector in the future.If the initial goal is not reached, we will use the available funds to complete as many studios as we can within the budget.

After an 18 year hiatus to raise my kids, I am unpausing my music career. While it’s been a long space of time, I haven’t stopped writing. I’ve been collecting songs and waiting for the right time to make a record. When COVID hit and slowed things down, I found myself with time to work on new music. In August, our dear friend and record producer, Greg Lafollette, moved back to Kansas City after being in Nashville for many years. He agreed to work with us and in the late summer of 2020 we brought this collection of 10 songs to life. I’ve named the album Finding My Footing.  I’m finding my footing as a songwriter and performer again, and as a woman, mother, and partner, I’m always on a search to find my footing through the challenges of life. </p><h3> </h3><h2>This Record</h2><p>I've realized as I've gotten older that songwriting is one of the ways I process through life's ups and downs.  We've had a lot of loss to work through the last several years: a life threatening miscarriage, a close friend's suicide, losing a parent, Brandon's heart attack three years ago.  Sometimes all I can do is pick up my guitar and strum.  Sometimes songs come, sometimes tears come.  It's a time of healing for me.  Most of the songs on <i>Finding My Footing</i> came from these very moments.  Some of them come from the joy of having a friend and partner of 24 years for whom I am so thankful to have in my life.  </p><p>Greg arrived at exactly the right moment for us.  We tried several times to work on making a record but always ran into some snag. He stepped in when we needed both inspiration and direction.  I have so appreciated his sensitivity to getting the emotion of each song right. He worked hard to make me feel comfortable and helped me process some difficult feelings during the recording. His production style and addition of vocals and instruments have helped to make this collection of songs a moving, beautiful album.  </p><h2>Our Plan</h2><p>That brings me to asking you, our friends and family, fans old and new, for your help to see this project through to the end. We have finished the recording but now we need to duplicate, and market the record in addition to covering initial expenses from recording. I know this is a hard time for so many people with all of the COVID shutdowns and changes. It has been difficult for many musicians who have had to find new ways to keep performing and creating. I believe this is the right time for this record. Even though some were written before COVID, the sentiment is right for this season and I hope it brings comfort to many people. I know music has helped me through many hard times. </p><h3> </h3><h3>What the funds will help us accomplish:</h3><p>Making cds (which includes packaging)</p><p>Vinyl record pressing (which involves extra vinyl specific mastering and packaging) </p><p>T-shirts</p><p>Stickers</p><p>Artwork prints</p><p>Any extra monies will go to cover expenses related to recording and production.</p><p>We have come up with different perks packages to help you get the items you are most interested in. Any amount is so appreciated! The packs will offer anything from a single sticker to a homemade meal and private concert at the Graves home in Lawrence, KS. Also, we are so very excited to be able to offer a one of a kind custom snare drum with art inspired by the album cover thanks to WFLIII Drums. </p><p> </p><h2>Risks and challenges:</h2><p>As you may know, crowdfunding is risky business. If we don’t raise enough money, we won’t be able to duplicate the record which will make it more challenging for us in the long run. CD and vinyl pressing is done in batches, usually not less than a few hundred.  Basically, if we sell 25 vinyl records in the funding campaign but we order 300, we will have records left to sell on our web store to new fans. This will help us offset the very low rate that we receive from streaming sites. The current pay out for streaming is $0.00331 per play. That’s $33 for 10,000 streams. Your support of this project will set us up for success by helping us launch without going in debt. </p><h3> </h3><h2>Ways you can help:</h2><p>Share with your friends!  Share this campaign on your social media pages or tell a friend who might be interested in supporting us.</p><p>“Follow” and “Like” @christenagravesmusic on Facebook and Instagram</p><p>Go to <a href=""https://www.christenagravesmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.christenagravesmusic.com</a> to join our email list for updates about gigs and upcoming projects.  </p><p> </p><p>I am so excited to bring this project to you at this time!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Zev Howling Music, recently I was approached by Liberty Music PR! They are a public relations company based in London and Los Angeles. They happened to stumble upon some of my music and would like for me to work with them. I have worked so hard for a chance to be noticed and this is my first LEGIT chance. This means having a real backing behind me and not just me working alone and doing my own promo. After years of no's I have a big chance to receive a huge YES and push to be a better artist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this to happen I need to raise $3000 for the campaign I am choosing. What that campaign is you might ask includes; Press pitching meaning articles, blogs, and advertisements. It also includes possible brand deals, playlisting and Radio. With this money I can get all these things taken care of, along with a new song! Liberty has major clients from Universal Music to Warner Music Group! Honestly this is so exciting! Even if this goal isn't met it will be used to independently promote and fund my music. The grind will not stop.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There isn't a guarantee that working with Liberty will get where I want to be entirely BUT, that is a chance we take as artists! The point of my campaign is to give myself the chance to take my music and craft even more serious. I have been doing this alone for so long I can really use this service to  do some real good in my career.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</p>
<p>The music industry is an intense and fast paced environment and it can eat new artists like myself up and never think twice about it. For every artist full of potential there's someone who can have 10X more that potential and be better at many things. But for me things like that do not matter at all! My love for this runs deeper than anything, there is nothing in this world that will keep me from my goal of being a great artist. Outworking my competition whether it be in the studio or out meeting new people and getting them into the vision. I don't like to call people fans I see these people as like minded friends who all want the same thing as me at the end of the day. Happiness and peace of mind.</p>

Since I was a little girl I have been singing, acting, dancing. I just wanted to tell stories and connect to people and spread the love through music, as the most innocent and sincere way of sharing peace on this world. I did believe I could <strong>change the world with music</strong>! </p><p>I grew up listening to Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond, Carmen McRae and Norah Jones. At the age of 15 I started taking classical singing classes and playing the tenor saxophone, and got into the music of the 60s and 70s with Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd. It was after I moved to Berlin that I started to treasure my roots in the Turkish music. And that's where my need to fusion the styles started as I became a fusion of cultures myself after 10 years of living in Berlin and living the rich music scene in Berlin showed me that music can bring people together!</p><p>After 3 years of long nights at the university in Berlin and a student band in 2013 I finally started going to jam sessions which inspired to me write songs with a ukulele I was given as a gift. That changed my life and reminded me of my dream again. <strong>SINGING FOR THE PEOPLE!</strong>  After I took courses at the jazz department during my exchange semester in the U.S. I started to prepare for jazz vocal programs of the music schools in Germany. Making it to the last auditions with three other singers in the HfMT Hamburg in 2016 gave me the motivation to keep going. After 3,5 years of working at my architecture job for 3,5 years in the day, getting tendonitis in my arms, singing in a lot of bands, writing songs in the night and recording arrangement ideas to my songs in the bathroom at work... Since we made the demo of the first song it was impossible for me to concentrate on anything else, I woke up and slept with ideas and sounds floating in my mind so I changed my life and had no other choice than to dedicate myself to my dream of recording my songs I've been writing for 7 years and <strong>share them from the heart with you</strong>!</p><p>And that's when I met the producer of this album Fico Jessen!</p><p> </p><h3><i>About the team and the project:</i></h3><p> </p><p>I met the amazing musician and producer <strong>Fico Jessen</strong> in January 2020 and we immediately connected and made a demo of my first single ""I'll be missing you"". After showing him the lead sheets of my songs and notebooks full of song sketches and seeing how he understood my music we just started to work on the idea of an album and oh you couldn't imagine how excited I am to see how the dream world in my head is becoming real!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608421420/e5xnaz23d4jacu2lje0i.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I’m so happy and lucky to be able to work with a great professional team with Aarón Castrillo on the drums and Lea Simon doing the artwork for the cover of the album. And one of the songs ""Seven hours"", which was the first song I ever played in public, we will produce with Roland Satterwhite, an amazing musician and my dear friend who made me believe in my music years before I trusted myself to bring it out like this! In addition we will invite further professional musicians to record the songs.</p><p><strong>Only with these amazing professionals are my songs able to grow and get out there to reach you. </strong></p><p>Although the Covid-19 hit the musicians and the culture scene really hard, and we miss playing live, it led us to stay in and produce with a creativity that was eager to be let out.</p><p> </p><h3>About my music:</h3><p> </p><p>You've seen my debut single but don't think that the album will be full of sad ballads! The influences of the music are mostly from my experiences since I came to Berlin with this dream (that's where“Pina Berlin” comes from) and from different kinds of genres from jazz to folk, pop, soul, brasilian music, blues, Turkish music, German poetry ethnic rhythms! Some songs have cinematic elements that will bring you to another world to tell their stories inspired by my love of everyday urban sounds and the power of their storytelling.</p><p>The songs are mostly in English but I have a special German-Turkish song which I am super excited about! So this is a whole journey which includes a song I wrote in 2013 but also my last song from the summer of 2020 in the middle of the pandemic and a personal health crisis ""There is always hope""...</p><p>Once a friend of mine said that my music makes her ""<i>feel </i><i>the sexy shaking through your body or feel inner tears with her ballad, pray with a mantra, but still at the end of the song you will feel the hope and positivity that leaves one with a spark of light in one's heart.</i>""<i> </i><strong>It's my biggest wish to connect with every single one of you in that level and spread the positivity and hope through music during these weird times!</strong></p><p> </p><h3><i>What do we need your support for?</i></h3><p> </p><p>I financed my first single myself and saved up money for this album however making a record as an independent artist is expensive and my savings were not enough to finish it. We already have the arrangements and demos of the songs ready and they are waiting to be recorded. We need your help to bring this project from a construction site to a finished album.</p><p>The making and release of this album will cost a sum of 10,200€ inclusive of:</p><ul>

Mein Name ist Pinar Tatlikazan und ich lade Euch persönlich ein, Teil des Debütalbums meines Soloprojekts namens ""Pina Berlin"" zu sein! Eure Unterstützung (über die Jahre und jetzt) bedeutet mir so viel und ich möchte mich wirklich mit Euch durch meine Musik verbinden, von der ich einige inspiriert von Euch geschrieben habe! Wir haben bereits die Arrangements und Demos der Songs fertig und sie warten darauf, aufgenommen zu werden. Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um dieses Projekt von einer Baustelle zu einem fertigen Album zu bringen.</p><p>Lesen Sie weiter, um mehr über mich, dieses Projekt und das Team zu erfahren...</p><h3>Über mich:</h3><p>Ich bin in Bursa /Türkei geboren und aufgewachsen und nach meiner Zeit in Istanbul an einem türkisch-deutschen Gymnasium und einem musikalischen Sommerkurs in Rostock bin ich 2010 nach Berlin gekommen, um ein Teil der Musik und Kultur zu sein und habe zunächst Architektur studiert. Seit ich ein kleines Mädchen war, habe ich gesungen, geschauspielert und getanzt. Ich wollte einfach Geschichten erzählen und mich mit Menschen verbinden und die Liebe durch Musik verbreiten, als die unschuldigste und aufrichtigste Art, Frieden auf dieser Welt zu teilen. Ich habe geglaubt, dass ich die Welt mit Musik verändern kann!</p><p>Ich wuchs mit dem Hören von Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond, Carmen McRae und Norah Jones auf. Mit 15 Jahren begann ich, klassischen Gesangsunterricht zu nehmen und Tenorsaxophon zu spielen, und geriet in die Musik der 60er und 70er Jahre mit Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd. Erst als ich nach Berlin zog, begann ich meine Wurzeln in der türkischen Musik zu schätzen. Und da begann mein Bedürfnis, die Stile zu fusionieren, da ich selbst eine Fusion der Kulturen wurde, nachdem ich 10 Jahre in Berlin lebte und die reiche Musikszene in Berlin mir zeigte, dass Musik Menschen zusammenbringen kann!</p><p>Nach 3 Jahren langer Nächte an der Universität in Berlin und einer Studentenband fing ich 2013 endlich an, zu Jam-Sessions zu gehen, was mich dazu inspirierte, Songs mit einer Ukulele zu schreiben, die ich geschenkt bekam. Das veränderte mein Leben und erinnerte mich wieder an meinen Traum. <strong>FÜR DIE MENSCHEN ZU SINGEN!</strong>  Nachdem ich während meines Austauschsemesters in den USA Kurse an der Jazzabteilung belegt hatte, begann ich mich auf die Jazzgesangsprogramme der Musikschulen in Deutschland vorzubereiten. Das Erreichen des letzten Vorsingens mit drei anderen Sängern an der HfMT Hamburg im Jahr 2016 gab mir die Motivation, weiterzumachen. Nachdem ich 3,5 Jahre lang tagsüber in meinem Architektur-Job gearbeitet, Sehnenscheidenentzündungen in den Armen bekommen, in vielen Bands gesungen, nachts Songs geschrieben und auf der Arbeit im Badezimmer Arrangement-Ideen zu meinen Songs aufgenommen hatte... Seit wir das Demo des ersten Songs gemacht haben, war es für mich unmöglich, mich auf etwas anderes zu konzentrieren, ich wachte auf und schlief mit Ideen und Sounds, die in meinem Kopf schwebten, also änderte ich mein Leben und hatte keine andere Wahl, als mich meinem Traum zu widmen, meine Songs, die ich seit 7 Jahren schreibe, aufzunehmen und sie von Herzen mit euch zu teilen!</p><p>Und da habe ich den Produzenten dieses Albums, Fico Jessen, kennengelernt!</p><p> </p><h3>Über das Team und das Projekt:</h3><p>Ich traf den großartigen Musiker und Produzenten Fico Jessen im Januar 2020 und wir verbanden uns sofort und machten ein Demo meiner ersten Single ""I'll be missing you"". Nachdem ich ihm die Leadsheets meiner Songs und Notizbücher voller Songskizzen gezeigt hatte und sah, wie sehr er meine Musik verstand, fingen wir einfach an, an der Idee eines Albums zu arbeiten, und oh ihr könnt euch nicht vorstellen, wie aufgeregt ich bin, zu sehen, wie die Traumwelt in meinem Kopf echt wird!</p><p>Ich bin so glücklich und habe das Glück, mit einem großartigen, professionellen Team arbeiten zu können, mit Aarón Castrillo am Schlagzeug und Lea Simon, die das Artwork für das Cover des Albums gemacht hat. Und einen der Songs ""Seven hours"", der der erste Song war, den ich jemals in der Öffentlichkeit gespielt habe, werden wir mit Roland Satterwhite produzieren, einem erstaunlichen Musiker und meinem lieben Freund, der mir den Glauben an meine Musik gegeben hat, Jahre bevor ich mir selbst zugetraut habe, sie so herauszubringen! Außerdem werden wir weitere professionelle Musiker einladen, um die Songs aufzunehmen.</p><p><strong>Nur mit diesen wundervollen Profis sind meine Songs in der Lage zu wachsen und nach draußen zu gelangen, um Sie zu erreichen</strong>.</p><p>Obwohl der Covid-19 die Musiker und die Kulturszene wirklich hart getroffen hat und wir es vermissen, live zu spielen, hat es uns dazu gebracht, drinnen zu bleiben und mit einer Kreativität zu produzieren, die unbedingt rausgelassen werden wollte.</p><p> </p><h3>Über meine Musik:</h3><p>Wir haben bereits die erste Single des Albums und meine Debütsingle 'I'll be missing you' mit dem offiziellen Video veröffentlicht, kurz bevor wir das Crowdfunding gestartet haben.</p><p>Auch wenn ich diesen Song vor 5 Jahren von einem Ort weit weg von zu Hause in einem 'vermissenden' Geisteszustand geschrieben habe, in dem ich die Vergangenheit, die Zukunft und den Moment vermisse, so sind wir heute in Lockdown nicht allzu weit voneinander entfernt und müssen uns trotzdem gegenseitig vermissen... Dieser Song ist für alle, die sich gerade in diesem 'vermissenden' Geisteszustand befinden, um sich daran zu erinnern, dass wir nicht alleine sind!</p><p>Denkt aber nicht, dass das Album voll von traurigen Balladen sein wird! Die Einflüsse der Musik sind größtenteils aus meinen Erfahrungen, seit ich mit diesem Traum nach Berlin gekommen bin (daher kommt ""Pina Berlin"") und aus verschiedenen Arten von Genres von Jazz bis Folk, Pop, Soul, brasilianischer Musik, Blues, türkischer Musik, deutscher Poesie und ethnischen Rhythmen! Einige Songs haben cineastische Elemente, die Sie in eine andere Welt versetzen und ihre Geschichten erzählen, inspiriert von meiner Liebe zu alltäglichen urbanen Klängen und der Kraft ihrer Erzählung.</p><p>Die Songs sind größtenteils auf Englisch, aber ich habe einen <strong>speziellen deutsch-türkischen Song</strong>, auf den ich super aufgeregt bin! Es ist also eine ganze Reise, die einen Song beinhaltet, den ich 2013 geschrieben habe, aber auch meinen letzten Song aus dem Sommer 2020 inmitten der Pandemie und einer persönlichen Gesundheitskrise <strong>""There is always hope""...</strong></p><p>Eine Freundin von mir sagte einmal, dass meine Musik sie dazu bringt,<i> ""das sexy Schütteln durch deinen Körper zu spüren oder innere Tränen mit meiner Ballade zu fühlen, mit einem Mantra zu beten, aber am Ende des Liedes fühlst du immer noch die Hoffnung und Positivität, die einen mit einem Funken Licht im Herzen zurücklässt."" </i>Es ist mein größter Wunsch, mich mit jedem einzelnen von euch auf dieser Ebene zu verbinden und die Positivität und Hoffnung durch Musik während dieser verrückten Zeiten zu verbreiten!</p><p> </p><h3>Wozu brauchen wir Eure Unterstützung?</h3><p>Ich habe meine erste Single selbst finanziert und Geld für dieses Album gespart, aber eine Platte als unabhängiger Künstler zu machen ist teuer und meine Ersparnisse reichten nicht aus, um es fertigzustellen. Wir haben bereits die Arrangements und Demos der Songs fertig und sie warten darauf, aufgenommen zu werden. Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um dieses Projekt von einer Baustelle zu einem fertigen Album zu bringen.</p><p>Die Herstellung und Veröffentlichung dieses Albums wird eine Summe von 10.000€ kosten, inklusive:</p><ul>

My name is Pinar Tatlikazan and I am personally inviting you to be a part of this debut album of my solo project called ""Pina Berlin""! Your support (through the years and now) means so much to me and I really want to connect with you through my music, some of which I wrote inspired by you! We already have the arrangements and demos of the songs ready and they are waiting to be recorded. We need your help to bring this project from a construction site to a finished album.We released the first single of the album and my debut single ‘I’ll be missing you’ with it's official video right before we started the crowdfunding.  Even though I wrote this song 5 years ago from a place far from home in a 'missing' state of mind, missing the past, the future and the moment, today in lockdown we are not too far from each other but still have to miss each other... This song is for everybody who is in that 'missing' state of mind right now to remember that we are not alone! Read on to learn about me, this project and the team... About me:  I was born and raised in Bursa /Turkey and after my time in Istanbul at a Turkish-German high school and a summer musical course in Rostock in 2010 I came to Berlin to be a part of the music and culture and first studied architecture. Since I was a little girl I have been singing, acting, dancing. I just wanted to tell stories and connect to people and spread the love through music, as the most innocent and sincere way of sharing peace on this world. I did believe I could change the world with music! I grew up listening to Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond, Carmen McRae and Norah Jones. At the age of 15 I started taking classical singing classes and playing the tenor saxophone, and got into the music of the 60s and 70s with Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd. It was after I moved to Berlin that I started to treasure my roots in the Turkish music. And that's where my need to fusion the styles started as I became a fusion of cultures myself after 10 years of living in Berlin and living the rich music scene in Berlin showed me that music can bring people together!After 3 years of long nights at the university in Berlin and a student band in 2013 I finally started going to jam sessions which inspired to me write songs with a ukulele I was given as a gift. That changed my life and reminded me of my dream again. SINGING FOR THE PEOPLE!  After I took courses at the jazz department during my exchange semester in the U.S. I started to prepare for jazz vocal programs of the music schools in Germany. Making it to the last auditions with three other singers in the HfMT Hamburg in 2016 gave me the motivation to keep going. After 3,5 years of working at my architecture job for 3,5 years in the day, getting tendonitis in my arms, singing in a lot of bands, writing songs in the night and recording arrangement ideas to my songs in the bathroom at work... Since we made the demo of the first song it was impossible for me to concentrate on anything else, I woke up and slept with ideas and sounds floating in my mind so I changed my life and had no other choice than to dedicate myself to my dream of recording my songs I've been writing for 7 years and share them from the heart with you!And that's when I met the producer of this album Fico Jessen! About the team and the project: I met the amazing musician and producer Fico Jessen in January 2020 and we immediately connected and made a demo of my first single ""I'll be missing you"". After showing him the lead sheets of my songs and notebooks full of song sketches and seeing how he understood my music we just started to work on the idea of an album and oh you couldn't imagine how excited I am to see how the dream world in my head is becoming real!I’m so happy and lucky to be able to work with a great professional team with Aarón Castrillo on the drums and Lea Simon doing the artwork for the cover of the album. And one of the songs ""Seven hours"", which was the first song I ever played in public, we will produce with Roland Satterwhite, an amazing musician and my dear friend who made me believe in my music years before I trusted myself to bring it out like this! In addition we will invite further professional musicians to record the songs.Only with these amazing professionals are my songs able to grow and get out there to reach you. Although the Covid-19 hit the musicians and the culture scene really hard, and we miss playing live, it led us to stay in and produce with a creativity that was eager to be let out. About my music: You've seen my debut single but don't think that the album will be full of sad ballads! The influences of the music are mostly from my experiences since I came to Berlin with this dream (that's where“Pina Berlin” comes from) and from different kinds of genres from jazz to folk, pop, soul, brasilian music, blues, Turkish music, German poetry ethnic rhythms! Some songs have cinematic elements that will bring you to another world to tell their stories inspired by my love of everyday urban sounds and the power of their storytelling.The songs are mostly in English but I have a special German-Turkish song which I am super excited about! So this is a whole journey which includes a song I wrote in 2013 but also my last song from the summer of 2020 in the middle of the pandemic and a personal health crisis ""There is always hope""...Once a friend of mine said that my music makes her ""feel the sexy shaking through your body or feel inner tears with her ballad, pray with a mantra, but still at the end of the song you will feel the hope and positivity that leaves one with a spark of light in one's heart."" It's my biggest wish to connect with every single one of you in that level and spread the positivity and hope through music during these weird times! What do we need your support for? I financed my first single myself and saved up money for this album however making a record as an independent artist is expensive and my savings were not enough to finish it. We already have the arrangements and demos of the songs ready and they are waiting to be recorded. We need your help to bring this project from a construction site to a finished album.The making and release of this album will cost a sum of 10,200€ inclusive of:
Production
Musicians
Studio rent
Mixing
Mastering
Printing the CDs and Vinyls
Artwork for the cover of the album
Publicity and promotion
Shipment of the physical copies 
Music Video

Einige Songs haben cineastische Elemente, die Sie in eine andere Welt versetzen und ihre Geschichten erzählen, inspiriert von meiner Liebe zu alltäglichen urbanen Klängen und der Kraft ihrer Erzählung.Die Songs sind größtenteils auf Englisch, aber ich habe einen speziellen deutsch-türkischen Song, auf den ich super aufgeregt bin! Es ist also eine ganze Reise, die einen Song beinhaltet, den ich 2013 geschrieben habe, aber auch meinen letzten Song aus dem Sommer 2020 inmitten der Pandemie und einer persönlichen Gesundheitskrise ""There is always hope""...Eine Freundin von mir sagte einmal, dass meine Musik sie dazu bringt, ""das sexy Schütteln durch deinen Körper zu spüren oder innere Tränen mit meiner Ballade zu fühlen, mit einem Mantra zu beten, aber am Ende des Liedes fühlst du immer noch die Hoffnung und Positivität, die einen mit einem Funken Licht im Herzen zurücklässt."" Es ist mein größter Wunsch, mich mit jedem einzelnen von euch auf dieser Ebene zu verbinden und die Positivität und Hoffnung durch Musik während dieser verrückten Zeiten zu verbreiten! Wozu brauchen wir Eure Unterstützung?Ich habe meine erste Single selbst finanziert und Geld für dieses Album gespart, aber eine Platte als unabhängiger Künstler zu machen ist teuer und meine Ersparnisse reichten nicht aus, um es fertigzustellen. Wir haben bereits die Arrangements und Demos der Songs fertig und sie warten darauf, aufgenommen zu werden. Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um dieses Projekt von einer Baustelle zu einem fertigen Album zu bringen.Die Herstellung und Veröffentlichung dieses Albums wird eine Summe von 10.000€ kosten, inklusive:
Produktion
Musiker
Studio-Miete
Abmischen
Mastering
Druck der CDs und Vinyls
Artwork für das Cover des Albums
Werbung und Promotion
Versand der physischen Kopien

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I founded the Revival Festival in 2015 in Vancouver, Canada to showcase the level of high-quality local talent in the area. Now more than ever, we need to show love and appreciation for our independent artists both globally and locally. Since I first visited Colombia in 2015, I fell in love with its people and its land. It’s since been my dream to bring the Revival Festival to the coast of Colombia, where locals share a passionate love of artistic expression but sadly do not have much access to live music. The Revival Festival will be one of the first events of its kind in the area, and we hope it will be a beacon of light for locals and tourists alike.  </p>
<p>We are happy to be donating one third of all profits to two charities - the El Rio Foundation and Women for Conservation. The El Rio Foundation focuses on offering educational support and community sport opportunities to the local community, in addition to reforestation and waste management projects. Women for Conservation works to empower women and girls to lead in the field of conservation by providing them with environmental education, resources to implement and complete projects, and access to a network of professional scientists and advisers. Both charities work in the Sierra Nevada to directly support small communities that now, more than ever, need as much help as possible.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you’re not only helping us bring the magic of live music to Colombia’s coast, but you’re also giving direct support to two extremely important causes.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help to raise £8000. This will cover the running costs of the festival including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security – our utmost priority is keeping our guests, performers, and the land safe and secure.</li>
<li>Licenses and permits – ensuring full compliance with local authorities.</li>
<li>Medical team – should any accidents or health concerns arise during the event; we will have fully trained medical personnel on-site.</li>
<li>Toilets and sanitation – for obvious reasons.</li>
<li>Stage construction – a safe, secure platform for our artists to play.</li>
<li>Sound and lighting – to bring the magic of our vision to life.</li>
<li>Artist travel and accommodation – to get our artists safely to and from the event and ensuring they have a safe and comfortable place to rest.</li>
<li>Water – ensuring our artists, crew and guests have access to clean drinking water.</li>
<li>Backup power – Generators to mitigate impact of potential power outages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The volatile political situation in Colombia has always been a problem. The main issue is that the country is constantly in a situation of instability due to potential revolution. However, what is happening there now has been happening in many countries. The youth of today are finally standing up and saying ""No More!"". This creates a potentially dangerous situation for the people (of the country), especially those who protest, but I believe it will eventually result in change for the better. In all my years visiting Colombia I have never seen extreme violence, and I have only ever witnessed tourism being treated with respect and gratitude. The current problems facing the country have nothing to do with visitors. The unrest is contained in the major cities far from the festival site. On the coast where we are holding the festival there is very little atmosphere from these events, and in general feels much safer. All that said, we do not take security lightly. We will have a specialist security team taking care of us for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>Colombia was affected terribly during the pandemic. At one point it was one of the most affected countries in the world. However, it is predicted that the majority of the population will be fully vaccinated by the beginning of October. The developing world is always impacted more when global events like this happen, and what has affected the country more than the virus itself, is poverty. Colombia is not a welfare state. The people received no governmental help during the pandemic. Colombia relies largely on tourism and trade. Events that bring tourism are more vital than ever. Now is the perfect time to help. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate financially, please consider sharing this campaign with your network and on your social media. Every little bit helps!</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello dear friends and family, and music lovers! I'm Jaana Narsipur, a jazz vocalist and music educator based in New York. I've been teaching and singing for many years - first in Chicago, and now in New York where I live with my husband and two young children.</p>
<p>I'm about to embark on a new chapter in my jazz career, releasing my first solo album! With the music already recorded and mixed, the first single will be released on September 3, 2021 and the complete album is projected for release in October 2021.</p>

<h3>The Music</h3>
<p>This album is focused on the music of two jazz masters - <strong>Horace Silver </strong>and<strong> Bob Dorough.</strong>  What connects these two jazz icons?  Songs that are remarkable for both their complexity and their catchy melodies, a grounding in the harmonic traditions of bebop, and always a sense of joyfulness and playfulness - that many times, coexists with a melancholy that reaches our core. </p>
<p>This album features my arrangements - some with my rhythm section, several featuring a great tenor saxophone and trumpet player, and one with a string quartet - of Horace Silver and Bob Dorough's tunes. There are a total of 10 songs on the album - including swing tunes, bluesy funky grooves, and several gorgeous ballads.</p>
<h3>The Musicians</h3>
<p>I am fortunate to have worked with a generous, talented group of musicians on this album.  We had a wonderful time making music together and that is reflected in the album!</p>

<h3>A Little About The Musicians </h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pam got her first big break singing with ""The Sammy Kaye Orchestra"" as the featured ""girl singer"". The Orchestra, based in New York City, toured the United States from coast to coast.

<p>Scott McQuade (PIANO) is about to enter his 20th year as a professional musician. Scott started taking music lessons at 4 1/2 and took his first 'gig' on his 5th birthday. Music is just in his blood. Scott has had the opportunity to perform alongside such world- renowned jazz artists as Louis Bellson, Randy Brecker, Cleveland Eaton, Jason Marsalis... just to name a few.</p>
<p>Tony Yohe (DRUMS) began playing drums professionally at the age of 10 in and around his hometown of Hartshorn, OK. He received his BA in Music Education from OSU. Tony has performed with internationally known musicians Ken Peplowski, Eddie Daniels, Randy Sandke, Ted Rosenthal and actress/singer Felicia Rashad. Tony is the organizer and leader of the 9 piece jazz band 'Swinghouse' and produced the band's self-titled CD in 2004.</p>
<p>Jay Garrett (VIBES) is o<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">riginally from Tennessee and went to school at North Texas State University. Garrett arrived in town a few years ago to take a teaching job. He taught at Monroe Demonstration Academy while also playing jazz around town in a variety of settings. The latter part of his musical life includes Jazz Depot performances with vocalist Annie Ellicott, and another appearance there as the featured artist in last year’s jazz composer series.</span></p>
<p>Wade Roberson (PERCUSSION) began playing professionally at 16 with the Don Linde Orchestra and Joe Fusco Orchestra. While pursuing his BA in Music Education Wade accompanied acts such as the Temptations, Kay Starr, the Four Aces and Marilyn May.

<p>I am recording this 6 song EP in Austin, Texas at Orb Recording Studios with producer and bassist from Blue October, Matt Noveskey.  With numerous days of pre-production, we have put together basically the soundtrack of my life that has been ringing in my head over the past year.

<div>Recording an EP costs a ton of money. I make my living from playing shows, from royalties earned from various music streaming services and from when songs are used for tv and film. This allows me to live day to day, but to be able to record the songs I write, I’m asking for a little help from my friends. Using IndieGoGo, people who want to own/love/cherish the album can pre-order it. I've also created some really awesome perks and this way, with your help I can create an album.<br/>

<p>My name is Ashina and I’ve been making music and experimenting with sounds for about 8 years. I’ve decided to take the plunge and start releasing my music on a physical format. Although notions of perfection have held me back from doing this sooner, we only live once and making, recording, and releasing music is something that I would like to continue pursuing throughout my life's journey. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I’ve lived in Chicago for the past decade and I think residing here has certainly shaped me in many ways. I am a firm believer that environment affects art; this EP will consist of 5 songs that I feel represent some energy I’ve absorbed living in this urban environment. Various synthesizers and sounds were used to make the music and a few of the songs feature recorded samples of mechanical objects. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The platform I will be releasing music on is called Sovereign State. This represents my need to secede from the overly critical inner voice and the fear of failure. Expression and intuition are essential and certainly worth exploring and pursuing.

But, what does it consist of that ""lack of funding""? It is all about sport events like Olympic Games, next year in Rio de Janeiro, the European Football Championship in France and the UEFA Champions League. What about arts? Eurovision Song Contest was, is and will be the hugest platform of new and successful artists whom wants to represent their countries. I am a huge fan of Eurovision Song Contest, and I used to be watching with my family, year after year at our living lounge and vibrating with all songs from all different countries.</p>
<p>Well. I can tell many of Eurofans are disappointed with the portuguese broadcaster decision and we started to share our opinion in social networks within different hashtags, but, until today, nobody had the idea of creating a crowdfunding campaign to change their mind and presenting an application to participate in the biggest music contest in the world.</p>
<p>Let's get together and make history. Every single donation is important to us. You will be our hero. Let's be ""the heroes of our time"".</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As far as we know, an application to participate in the contest is a bit expensive. But how much? We think we will need at least €250,000 to make it viable. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">All the money will go to RTP to cover all expenses with the participation and artist selection. </span></p>
<p>And the best of all is: if you help us and if we reach the target, you could go watch LIVE the biggest song contest in the world, in Stockholm, Sweden. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Starting from a simple postcard, to a basket of portuguese products, or even a weekend break in Lisbon, there's many reasons to contribute to our crowdfunding.</span></p>
<p>If, in a little chance, the crowdfunding campaign doesn't reach the minimum value, all the money will go to Casa do Artista, a non-profit association which targets to support all artists, musicians, actors and arts in Portugal. More information at <a href=""http://www.casadoartista.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.casadoartista.net</a> (in portuguese).</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We believe Portugal have already all the respect and admiration of all countries and Eurofans in Europe and rest of the World. We can prove that together we have the power to change the things, even to change RTP directors' mind and present, at least, a temporary application to European Broadcasters Union (EBU) to participate at Eurovision Song Contest.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Portugal participates in the contest for more than 50 years and never won, or even made a TOP5. We still believe that it is possible to win the contest, or, at least, to get a great result and make all the 15-million portuguese and lusodescendents proud of being part of a great country called Portugal.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This is not only a song contest. It's the stage where we can share our origin, our culture, our beliefs, our strengths in a 3-minute song. But, at the same time, there's some risks, like failing the qualification to the finals, or even finishing <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">last in the semi-finals. But, at least, our mission is to make it possible to see our country, and having those goosebumps every time we see Portugal in the stage being represented by an outstanding artist, year after year.</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We will understand if you can't afford and help us in our crowdfunding, but you can still help us. Share our campaign on social networks, or on your site or personal blog. Just don't forget our hashtag #letsmakehistoryforPortugal everytime you share.</p>

We think we will need at least €250,000 to make it viable. All the money will go to RTP to cover all expenses with the participation and artist selection. 
And the best of all is: if you help us and if we reach the target, you could go watch LIVE the biggest song contest in the world, in Stockholm, Sweden. Starting from a simple postcard, to a basket of portuguese products, or even a weekend break in Lisbon, there's many reasons to contribute to our crowdfunding.
If, in a little chance, the crowdfunding campaign doesn't reach the minimum value, all the money will go to Casa do Artista, a non-profit association which targets to support all artists, musicians, actors and arts in Portugal. More information at http://www.casadoartista.net (in portuguese).   The Impact We believe Portugal have already all the respect and admiration of all countries and Eurofans in Europe and rest of the World. We can prove that together we have the power to change the things, even to change RTP directors' mind and present, at least, a temporary application to European Broadcasters Union (EBU) to participate at Eurovision Song Contest.
It is a shame that Portugal participates in the contest for more than 50 years and never won, or even made a TOP5. We still believe that it is possible to win the contest, or, at least, to get a great result and make all the 15-million portuguese and lusodescendents proud of being part of a great country called Portugal.   Risks & Challenges This is not only a song contest. It's the stage where we can share our origin, our culture, our beliefs, our strengths in a 3-minute song. But, at the same time, there's some risks, like failing the qualification to the finals, or even finishing last in the semi-finals. But, at least, our mission is to make it possible to see our country, and having those goosebumps every time we see Portugal in the stage being represented by an outstanding artist, year after year.
    Other Ways You Can Help We will understand if you can't afford and help us in our crowdfunding, but you can still help us. Share our campaign on social networks, or on your site or personal blog. Just don't forget our hashtag #letsmakehistoryforPortugal everytime you share.
Thank you for your attention and all support given to our project.

</h2><div>When I was a young boy growing up outside of Atlanta in a town called Carrollton, which not too many people outside of it have heard of, I knew I wanted to be a musician - an artist. I would put on little shows around the house, hanging up posters on the wall, and I would sing along to my favorite songs and even would start writing my own when I was only in first grade. I remember carrying around a notepad and just writing down every thought that went into my head. Not much today has changed for me since then. I am currently in school and finding the finances to produce this record, while taking copious hours, working a job, and studio time, is difficult. However, I am determined and I am passionate. I know that this is exactly what I need to be doing -creating music to share with the world.</div><h2>WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME</h2><div>Being able to share my music with the world is the only reason I get up in the morning. Furthermore, MUSIC is the only reason I get up in the morning. Having the ability to change someone's life and be there friend firstly through the songs I write, is so amazing to me. I know that even though I have never met some of my favorite artists, theres still this undefined connection that is between us. I have already began to create relationships with people I had never met before through my music and I plan to continue that.</div><h2>MY GOAL</h2><h2>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span>
</h2><p>I want to help people realize that they aren't alone. I want to show that, even though I am a pop musician who happens to be a guy, that it is okay to bare your soul and show your emotions. Being vulnerable does not need to equal embarrassment.  Being vulnerable  is one of the most beautiful things about being human. </p><p>Music has a way of making that vulnerability even more beautiful.</p><p><br/></p><p>Every single dollar helps. Really. If all you can give is a few bucks, it is still as appreciated as anything else. I cannot wait to share what I have been working on with everyone. I am hopeful. I am joyful. Most importantly, I am blessed to get to do what I love to do. So, thank you in advanced.</p><p>Let's get this thing produced together!</p><p>-B</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;""></span><br/>

</p><p>The Westminster Chamber Singers are touring France in May
2016. The choir will be singing in cathedrals, churches, and concert halls and performing
in some of the most historic locations in France, including: Eglise de la
Madeleine, Notre Dame, and Chapelle des Penitents. </p>
<p>In addition to performing we will have the opportunity to
experience and learn about French culture. We will balance the intense
performing schedule with daily sight-seeing trips to museums and other historic
sites. One of the goals we hope to achieve is to gain a deeper appreciation for
the challenges of performing while traveling; an experience we cannot get in a
classroom! We also hope to return from the tour with a broader view of the
world and deeper appreciation for our own country. </p>
<p>Dr. Christopher Quinn, Director of the Chamber Singers, has
been touring with the choir since 2000. The choir has brought their music to
audiences in China, England, France, Scotland, Ireland, and throughout the
United States. Audiences rave about the choir’s expressive singing and
continually ask the choir back for return engagements. He is very excited to
return to France to share a world-class experience with his students.</p>
<p> 
Your donations will go directly into the Choir's Tour Fund, reducing the cost
for all students. For this reason we have set an ambitious fundraising goal of
$25,000 in just under 60 days! You can help by making a donation and/or by
forwarding our message along to your friends and family. We also would love to
see you at our concerts this year!</p>

<p>The Jacksonville
Songwriter Residency with the Stetson Kennedy Foundation in partnership with St. Johns County Parks Dept. and Florida Communities Trust aim to activate a vital
part of Northeast Florida's Cultural history, and a landmark of national significance, to create a Songwriter
Residency at Beluthahatchee Park. </p>
<p>The site has been designated a National
Literary Landmark twice, the only such location in the U.S. to be so designated,
once for Stetson Kennedy’s body of work, and also for legendary songwriter Woody Guthrie where he
wrote over 80 songs including the song “Stetson Kennedy” and the manuscript for
“Seeds of Man.” </p>
<p>Stetson Kennedy’s vision was for this site to become a place
for artists, musicians, and writers to gather to practice their craft and
create. It is awe inspiring for us to continue his great legacy on the verge of his centennial. When a songwriter writes a song it is intrinsically tied to that place
forever. The song then travels the world through the songwriter, and becomes part of our global culture.  This project has been approved by the Stetson
Kennedy Foundation and would highlight St. Johns County innovative support for
the Arts and Beluthahatchee as a national place where songs are actively written
building upon its profound cultural legacy.</p>
  In
the first year (2016) we will host 4 professional songwriters for 1-2 weeks. They will be free to live and write in this beautiful inspiring location. They will perform at least one showcase in the area and will donate handwritten lyrics to the Stetson Kennedy Foundation and Museum. Housing is provided on site at no cost to the songwriter and we hope to provide a travel stipend and a paid public showcase. </div><div>Please contact me if you wish to partner with this inspiring project!</div><div>Thank You,</div><div>Brad Lauretti</div><div>Founder of the Jacksonville Songwriter Residency</div><div>
