understand.</p>
<p>In the quest
to keep our own dedicated little babies safe, clean and looking new, over the past
couple of years we've created something we think you'll feel pretty good
about.  We sure did.</p>
<p><b>AN HISTORICALLY NASTY PROBLEM</b></p>
<p>It doesn't take long.  The first time your screen makes contact with your keyboard when your MacBook is closed, it will leave permanent scratches.  Happens on iPads with keyboard covers, too. And it just gets worse.</p><p>Just. Like. This:</p><p></p><p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/541328/files/20140428213928-scratched_screen_1.jpg?1398746368"" src="""" style=""width: 353.14079422382673px; height: 268px;""/></p><p></p><p>We knew this was a problem, because we all had it.  But then we found countless complaints from people who were flipping out over even recently purchased notebooks that started showing ""weird little marks"" on their pristine screens!  Not a design flaw, but a result of our penchant for thin, thin, thin, this same, nasty problem had been going on for years.</p><blockquote>
<b>From MacRumors Forums</b>: ""Does anyone else have the problem with their MBA having hairline scratches on the screen from contact with the keyboard or trackpad? I didn't realize this was happening on my 13"" until I tried to clean it and noticed there are small dot scratches running in a line all the way across the screen. It lines up perfectly with the space bar and the metal dip under the keyboard before it meets the trackpad.""</blockquote><blockquote>
<b>From MacForums</b>: ""Just something interesting that happened to me last night: I was eating potato chips whilst working on my MBP, and a 1-mm crumb landed on the wrist rest area. I didn't noticed and I closed the lappy when I turned in. This morn, when I opened it I noticed an itty-bitty dark spot on the screen which left a smudge when I swiped off with my finger. Knowing that my fingers weren't particularly greasy at the time, I wondered. I took a hanky and cleaned the smudge, and then I noticed the potato crumb in the afore mentioned area.<br/><br/>Moral of the story: just keep your machine always as clean as possible (especially the keyboard area), as sometimes it's debris the cause of screen scratches more than it's the keys.""<br/>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<b>From Apple Support Forums</b>: ""I have the Macbook Pro Retina 15"" and have experienced the same ""dust damage "" to my screen. Originally told i must have closed it with grit on the trackpad ! I take good care of all of my equipment as at £2000+ i cannot afford not to!""</blockquote><p>Some twisted comfort in knowing it's a universal problem, yes, but we had a solution ready to go!</p><p><b>ELEGANT, EFFECTIVE PROTECTION. NOTHING BETTER.</b></p><p>Scudo is
from a Latin word meaning shield. 
After all the research on the most effective material, and all the testing, cutting, fitting and testing again,
we've come up with the absolute best way to protect your notebook screens and
keyboards and keep them looking new for a very, very long time.</p><p>While we all agree cases, slips and covers are really good ideas, nobody's taken this part of protection seriously until now.</p><p>Made from genuine Ultrasuede®, Scudo naturally stays put between your keyboard and screen when you're traveling or about town.  It's an effective cushion, keeping the two from casually - and sometimes not so casually - making unauthorized contact.</p><p>Without Scudo, that means keys-meet-screen and leave increasingly ugly and permanent marks in commemoration.  Not a good look.  And, as a delightful bonus, Scudo keeps the natural skin oils that build up on keys from touching the screen, and even provides a bit of shock absorption.  All the while looking rather fetching, right?</p>

<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Scudo is the
best kind of paradox.  It's tough and
durable, while it's also very light, soft and beautiful.  It won't tear, fray or ball-up, is very
colorfast and is easily hand or machine washed. 
But it looks and feels just like a very fine suede.  And it's a responsibly engineered, uniquely
molded fabric that is 100% recyclable.  There is nothing better.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>MADE FOR...WHAT, EXACTLY?</b></p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Out of the gate, it's all Apple.  We have six models that cover Apple's five current notebooks and iPads using covers with integrated keyboards (see below).  Each has their own, specific

We can do older models, too, but we'll need to get enough requests to make them. Each new model requires a full set of tools and a production schedule, and will be made in quantities on precision, industrial machinery.<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">[IMPORTANT] When you choose your Perk we'll have to know what color and size you need.

</span></div>","A HEALTHY OBSESSIONMany of us treat our MackBooks and iPads better than, well, some of our ""good"" friends.  It's pretty safe to say we're kind of obsessed with them.  In a healthy, loving way, of course.So, you'll
understand.
In the quest
to keep our own dedicated little babies safe, clean and looking new, over the past
couple of years we've created something we think you'll feel pretty good
about.  We sure did.
AN HISTORICALLY NASTY PROBLEM
It doesn't take long.  The first time your screen makes contact with your keyboard when your MacBook is closed, it will leave permanent scratches.  Happens on iPads with keyboard covers, too. And it just gets worse.Just. Like. This:                          We knew this was a problem, because we all had it.  But then we found countless complaints from people who were flipping out over even recently purchased notebooks that started showing ""weird little marks"" on their pristine screens!  Not a design flaw, but a result of our penchant for thin, thin, thin, this same, nasty problem had been going on for years.
From MacRumors Forums: ""Does anyone else have the problem with their MBA having hairline scratches on the screen from contact with the keyboard or trackpad? I didn't realize this was happening on my 13"" until I tried to clean it and noticed there are small dot scratches running in a line all the way across the screen. It lines up perfectly with the space bar and the metal dip under the keyboard before it meets the trackpad.""
From MacForums: ""Just something interesting that happened to me last night: I was eating potato chips whilst working on my MBP, and a 1-mm crumb landed on the wrist rest area. I didn't noticed and I closed the lappy when I turned in. This morn, when I opened it I noticed an itty-bitty dark spot on the screen which left a smudge when I swiped off with my finger. Knowing that my fingers weren't particularly greasy at the time, I wondered. I took a hanky and cleaned the smudge, and then I noticed the potato crumb in the afore mentioned area.Moral of the story: just keep your machine always as clean as possible (especially the keyboard area), as sometimes it's debris the cause of screen scratches more than it's the keys.""

From Apple Support Forums: ""I have the Macbook Pro Retina 15"" and have experienced the same ""dust damage "" to my screen. Originally told i must have closed it with grit on the trackpad ! I take good care of all of my equipment as at £2000+ i cannot afford not to!""Some twisted comfort in knowing it's a universal problem, yes, but we had a solution ready to go!ELEGANT, EFFECTIVE PROTECTION. NOTHING BETTER.Scudo is
from a Latin word meaning shield. 
After all the research on the most effective material, and all the testing, cutting, fitting and testing again,
we've come up with the absolute best way to protect your notebook screens and
keyboards and keep them looking new for a very, very long time.While we all agree cases, slips and covers are really good ideas, nobody's taken this part of protection seriously until now.Made from genuine Ultrasuede®, Scudo naturally stays put between your keyboard and screen when you're traveling or about town.  It's an effective cushion, keeping the two from casually - and sometimes not so casually - making unauthorized contact.Without Scudo, that means keys-meet-screen and leave increasingly ugly and permanent marks in commemoration.  Not a good look.  And, as a delightful bonus, Scudo keeps the natural skin oils that build up on keys from touching the screen, and even provides a bit of shock absorption.  All the while looking rather fetching, right?
The magic of Ultrasuede® begins with ultra-microfibers so fine they can't be seen by the naked eye: so minute a single pound could be stretched from the earth to the moon - and back!  Sheesh.
Scudo is the
best kind of paradox.  It's tough and
durable, while it's also very light, soft and beautiful.  It won't tear, fray or ball-up, is very
colorfast and is easily hand or machine washed. 
But it looks and feels just like a very fine suede.  And it's a responsibly engineered, uniquely
molded fabric that is 100% recyclable.  There is nothing better.
MADE FOR...WHAT, EXACTLY?
Out of the gate, it's all Apple.  We have six models that cover Apple's five current notebooks and iPads using covers with integrated keyboards (see below).  Each has their own, specific
size.  Of which, rather fortuitously, we have right here:


MacBook Air 11
MacBook Air 13
MacBook Pro 13 pre-Retina
MacBook Pro 13 Retina
MacBook Pro 15 Retina
iPad, iPad Air



When you snag a Scudo or two, we'll ask you which MacBook or iPad you have. We can do older models, too, but we'll need to get enough requests to make them. Each new model requires a full set of tools and a production schedule, and will be made in quantities on precision, industrial machinery.[IMPORTANT] When you choose your Perk we'll have to know what color and size you need. The only way on IndieGoGo to make option choices is to:


Choose the Perk

After you get a confirmation email, near the bottom of the note, just below the blue box with the transaction details, click on John Wojewidka's name to send us your choice of colors and which MacBook you need them for.

SCUDONOMICS 101
Some quick arithmetic.  Besides a much-better life experience, this $15 product can save you a lot down the

Our own
obsessions go deep.  And although we all have long histories in varied businesses, we all like to keep our

the best corner radii and selecting rich, vibrant colors that will make you
feel rather good every time you open your notebook.



And while we
could (not!) cut each one out with a sharp pair of scissors every time we got
an order, we are excruciatingly particular about fit - and, of course - the

<div>cardZcase is a patented sleek iphone 4/4S premium quality case for discreetly storing a credit card or working contactless/NFC/RFID payment, travel or work ID card. It adds just 1mm to the thickness profile of the iphone. It is easy to detach and use the consealed card conventionally in an ATM or with Chip and Pin. But a smart card co-located with the iphone within the case effectively give you Contactless payment on your exisiting iphone!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""The white cardZcase prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1247.photobucket.com/albums/gg629/cardZcase/DSC_0288-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>THE TEAM</h2>
<div>The cardZcase team is based in Cambridge in the UK. Mark is our front man and artist. Pascal is the one with lots of previous internet sales experience. We also have the support of our friends and colleagues who have invested both time and money to get us to this point.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>THE PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<div>
<div>We believe the world should be a place where good innovations flourish - whether they come from a billion dollar multinational corporation or a tiny start-up like ours.  And we ask for your support for cardZcase to prove it.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>INCEPTION</h2>
<div>I'm sure many of you are like us and have forgetten your wallet or your ID card. Quite frustating isn't it? but surprisingly not many of us forget our smartphones thesedays. Thinking about these issues we came up with idea of attaching the credit card or ID card to the smartphone.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But to keep things safe the card needed to be discreetly attached yet easlity accessibly. We started in June 2011 and after much thought and many design versions later we ultimately came up with this simple yet elegant design which (surprise, surprise) we've called 'cardZcase' - your card and your iphone - 'secretly together' in an british designed case which only adds 1mm to the profile of the iphone.The current CardZcase will fit the iphone 4/4S, both the black and white versions.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>DONT TOUCH ME</h2>
<div>This card also gives exisiting iphone 4/4S users the ability to use Contactless payments in thousands of establishments with their existing contactless card. A surprisingly low tech solution to the future of mobile payments - No apps to download and install, no service to sign up to, no complicated setting - Just put in your exisiting contactless card in the case and off you go.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It looks, feels and behaves like the iphone has integrated contactless payment. Every vendor who has seen us use the case is always amazed how we were able to add contactless functionality to an iphone!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Millions of people already have contactless cards in their wallets without knowing it. Use the contactless feature by simply swiping the phone on the payment terminal. If you don't have contactless then you can always use the card as a conventional card by removing it and easily replacing it back.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>MARCH OF THE OYSTERS</h2>
<div>Clearly all NFC/RFID cards which are shaped like a credit card (ID-1 specification to be exact) can fit into the case. This makes it rather handy to use with many public transport smart cards. No more fiddling to get the card out of your wallet. We've extensively tested the card on London's OYSTER underground system and it works like a charm. It will similarly work on many other smart transport cards - pity though we haven't got around to travelling the world to test them - perhaps a future indiegogo project;)</div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>WORK WORK AND MORE WORK</h2>
<div>For many of us, our work ID cards are not only our photo identification, they are also our keyless entry into work. They control access into car parks, office buildings and adjacent areas. ID-1 or credit card size IDs fit snugly into cardZcase and work seamlessly to allow your iphone to give you access. You may never be able to use the excuse of the misplaced work access card again to come late to work!</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2>PRODUCTION EXCELLENCE</h2>
</div>
<div>The cases will be sourced from our British based partners. They have over a decade of experience in case manufacture and they make cases for Ted Baker, Quiksilver etc and are part of supply chain for even the likes of Bentley. So though we may be a start-up the quality of the product will be at the top end of the range.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Though we have produced white and black prototypes, the first production cases will be be of much better build quality that the ones you can see in our pictures. We've chosen to go with the black case which will be pretty much the same as the ones on the pictures except for a small cardZcase logo on the external surface of the case.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""brighton pier"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1247.photobucket.com/albums/gg629/cardZcase/brightonpierfrontageproporta.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
<div>
<div>We've spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars designing, patenting and prototyping this case. There are 4 patents granted and registrations in 25 countries are already in place. These have taken a long time to put into place with a steep learning curve for our team but with intellectual property protection in place, we are the only people in the world who can provide you with this exclusive design feature!</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>PERKS</h2>
<div>We need your support to provide us the money to get manufacturing off the ground for the final leg of this long journey.  In return we offer you the chance to be the first to own these cases as soon as they come off the production line. You will literally be the first in the world to own these babies!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The first 50 to support us with $10s get a black cardZcase as a special thank you. We also thank subsequent pledges of support for $15 (first 100) and $20 with the chance to be amongst the first worldwide to have these cardZcases. There are greater incentives for larger donations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2>SHOW ME THE MONEY</h2>
</div>
<div>So what does the $14,000 get us? We'll here what we hope your support will get us:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) indiegogo and credit card/paypal transaction charges (7 percent)</div>
<div>2) Cost of final pre-production design modifications</div>
<div>3) Production of Tools for case manufacture</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For each of the the hundreds of cases as part of the perks:</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4) Manufacture of polymer case</div>
<div>5) 'Soft touch' coating and design layered on each case</div>
<div>6) Manufacture of case packaging</div>
<div>7) Transport, shipping and handling fees</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After we have posted off all the perks, We estimate we will have some samples left for us to show to traditional sales outlets to encourage them to start selling these cases and get a conventional business off the ground.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After the close of fundraising on indiegogo, there a short delay before we get the money. After that we hope to start posting out the perks in 4 weeks.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>THE FUTURE</h2>
<p>If we meet out funding goal, all of you will have shown that there is a demand for cardZcase and a future in investing in further production. We hope to form a viable small interprise that will ultimately provide employment locally and contribute to the economy. Hopefully the future holds lots of different cardZcase designs for the iphone and similar ones for other smartphones as well.</p>
<div> </div>
<h2>WE VALUE YOUR SUPPORT - IN ALL ITS FORMS</h2>
<div>I hope you have belief in our product - we do! For those willing to support us at the earliest stage we have some great incentives.  Even if you're not in the market for a unique functional high quality iphone case, please consider helping in the following ways:</div>

<p><br/> </p></div>","THE PRODUCT
cardZcase is a patented sleek iphone 4/4S premium quality case for discreetly storing a credit card or working contactless/NFC/RFID payment, travel or work ID card. It adds just 1mm to the thickness profile of the iphone. It is easy to detach and use the consealed card conventionally in an ATM or with Chip and Pin. But a smart card co-located with the iphone within the case effectively give you Contactless payment on your exisiting iphone!
 

 
 
THE TEAM
The cardZcase team is based in Cambridge in the UK. Mark is our front man and artist. Pascal is the one with lots of previous internet sales experience. We also have the support of our friends and colleagues who have invested both time and money to get us to this point.
 
 
THE PHILOSOPHY

We believe the world should be a place where good innovations flourish - whether they come from a billion dollar multinational corporation or a tiny start-up like ours.  And we ask for your support for cardZcase to prove it.

 
 
INCEPTION
I'm sure many of you are like us and have forgetten your wallet or your ID card. Quite frustating isn't it? but surprisingly not many of us forget our smartphones thesedays. Thinking about these issues we came up with idea of attaching the credit card or ID card to the smartphone.
 
But to keep things safe the card needed to be discreetly attached yet easlity accessibly. We started in June 2011 and after much thought and many design versions later we ultimately came up with this simple yet elegant design which (surprise, surprise) we've called 'cardZcase' - your card and your iphone - 'secretly together' in an british designed case which only adds 1mm to the profile of the iphone.The current CardZcase will fit the iphone 4/4S, both the black and white versions.
 
 
DONT TOUCH ME
This card also gives exisiting iphone 4/4S users the ability to use Contactless payments in thousands of establishments with their existing contactless card. A surprisingly low tech solution to the future of mobile payments - No apps to download and install, no service to sign up to, no complicated setting - Just put in your exisiting contactless card in the case and off you go.
 
It looks, feels and behaves like the iphone has integrated contactless payment. Every vendor who has seen us use the case is always amazed how we were able to add contactless functionality to an iphone!
 
Millions of people already have contactless cards in their wallets without knowing it. Use the contactless feature by simply swiping the phone on the payment terminal. If you don't have contactless then you can always use the card as a conventional card by removing it and easily replacing it back.
 
 
MARCH OF THE OYSTERS
Clearly all NFC/RFID cards which are shaped like a credit card (ID-1 specification to be exact) can fit into the case. This makes it rather handy to use with many public transport smart cards. No more fiddling to get the card out of your wallet. We've extensively tested the card on London's OYSTER underground system and it works like a charm. It will similarly work on many other smart transport cards - pity though we haven't got around to travelling the world to test them - perhaps a future indiegogo project;)
 
WORK WORK AND MORE WORK
For many of us, our work ID cards are not only our photo identification, they are also our keyless entry into work. They control access into car parks, office buildings and adjacent areas. ID-1 or credit card size IDs fit snugly into cardZcase and work seamlessly to allow your iphone to give you access. You may never be able to use the excuse of the misplaced work access card again to come late to work!
 
 

PRODUCTION EXCELLENCE

The cases will be sourced from our British based partners. They have over a decade of experience in case manufacture and they make cases for Ted Baker, Quiksilver etc and are part of supply chain for even the likes of Bentley. So though we may be a start-up the quality of the product will be at the top end of the range.
 
Though we have produced white and black prototypes, the first production cases will be be of much better build quality that the ones you can see in our pictures. We've chosen to go with the black case which will be pretty much the same as the ones on the pictures except for a small cardZcase logo on the external surface of the case.
 
 

 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We've spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars designing, patenting and prototyping this case. There are 4 patents granted and registrations in 25 countries are already in place. These have taken a long time to put into place with a steep learning curve for our team but with intellectual property protection in place, we are the only people in the world who can provide you with this exclusive design feature!
 
PERKS
We need your support to provide us the money to get manufacturing off the ground for the final leg of this long journey.  In return we offer you the chance to be the first to own these cases as soon as they come off the production line. You will literally be the first in the world to own these babies!!
 
The first 50 to support us with $10s get a black cardZcase as a special thank you. We also thank subsequent pledges of support for $15 (first 100) and $20 with the chance to be amongst the first worldwide to have these cardZcases. There are greater incentives for larger donations.
 
 

SHOW ME THE MONEY

So what does the $14,000 get us? We'll here what we hope your support will get us:
 
1) indiegogo and credit card/paypal transaction charges (7 percent)
2) Cost of final pre-production design modifications
3) Production of Tools for case manufacture
 
For each of the the hundreds of cases as part of the perks:

 
4) Manufacture of polymer case
5) 'Soft touch' coating and design layered on each case
6) Manufacture of case packaging
7) Transport, shipping and handling fees
 
After we have posted off all the perks, We estimate we will have some samples left for us to show to traditional sales outlets to encourage them to start selling these cases and get a conventional business off the ground.
 
After the close of fundraising on indiegogo, there a short delay before we get the money. After that we hope to start posting out the perks in 4 weeks.
 
 
THE FUTURE
If we meet out funding goal, all of you will have shown that there is a demand for cardZcase and a future in investing in further production. We hope to form a viable small interprise that will ultimately provide employment locally and contribute to the economy. Hopefully the future holds lots of different cardZcase designs for the iphone and similar ones for other smartphones as well.
 
WE VALUE YOUR SUPPORT - IN ALL ITS FORMS
I hope you have belief in our product - we do! For those willing to support us at the earliest stage we have some great incentives.  Even if you're not in the market for a unique functional high quality iphone case, please consider helping in the following ways:

Linkable Fusion Packs (Video to come shortly):</h3><ul>
<li>The most exciting thing about the next generation Fusion Pack is the ability to link multiple Fusion Packs together to increase the battery capacity. While one Fusion Pack has 24000mah, when you use the linkage tool to connect the two Fusion Packs together, and you now have 48000mah of power to continue to charge you devices for double the time. Unlike with other battery packs don't have to unplug or switch the wiring with linked Fusion Packs. Now you can link two Fusion Packs together and keep your device running for twice the time.</li>
<li>We have redesign the power management system of the Next Generation Fusion Pack so when you plug in the wall charge it charges like normal, but when you plug in the linking adapter the Battery Packs are linked together so you can have double the battery capacity &amp; double the charging time.</li>
</ul><p>For example:</p><ul>
<li>Imagine watching the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy (extended edition of course!) on your flight from California to South Africa without ever having to have your laptop plugged in or swapping batteries!</li>
<li>Running your home office (e.g. your laptop, wireless router, and smartphone) through a multi-day power outage. </li>
<li>Or if there is a natural disaster and your are without power (such as lights or heat). With the linked Fusion Packs you can have some light and run a small heater (using the cigarette lighter adapter) for a few days till the power comes back on.</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/394960/files/20140225180827-5526c84a30dcf9e2c2c125e5b77f18f3_large.png?1393380507"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Here is a picture of the Linked Fusion Packs</p><h4>How does Fusion Pack linking work?</h4><ul>
<li>
<b>The non-techie answer: </b>With the linking adapter you simply connect the two fusion packs together and are able to add 24000mAh to the battery capacity of the Linked Fusion Pack. For example link 2 Fusion Packs together you get 48000mAh of capacity, 3 linked together means  72000mAh, and so forth</li>
<li>
<b>The techie answer: </b>We designed the power management system to be able to link the Fusion Packs together in series. That means that the the Fusion Packs will drain sequentially (you'll use up the battery of the first Fusion Pack and then the second Fusion Pack).</li>
</ul><h4>Why would you link the Fusion Packs?</h4><ul><li>Link the Fusion Packs together lets you have continuous power for longer periods of time. So you can set up your Linked Fusion Packs and not have to worry about switching between power supplies when one runs out. This allows you to supply power to your devices for longer periods of time without worrying about the power running out (unlike other battery packs where you would have to be constantly watching the power level of each battery pack to know when to switch the battery pack). </li></ul><h1>Other Cool Features of the Linkable Next Generation Fusion Pack:</h1><h3><b>2.)

Charge 3 different types of devices at the same time! (16/19V, 12V, and USB all at the same time)Each Fusion Pack has 3 Different types of outputs: You can charge at 3 different voltages at the same time (USB, 12V, and 16-19V) 
3.) Scratch Resistant (Nearly Scratch-Proof) Case:
This case is durable. It can with-stand just about anything you throw at it and won't get scratched. The aluminum we will use is a harden sandblasted aluminum that won't get scratched up.4.) Design:
Component Design: Unlike cheap designs or ones that break after a few uses. The next generation Fusion Pack is designed to outlast the devices it charges. 
Case Design: Inspired by the sleek Ultra-books, we designed the next generation Fusion Pack to have a slim design while sitting nicely on a desk, table, or airplane tray. 
5.) Cigarette Lighter Device Connector:If you are like us you have a lot of adapters for your car to charge your devices. Now you can use those same car adapters with next generation Fusion Pack no matter where you are.Why we need your help:The Utah CNC shop was a great aid in helping us create a nice looking next generation prototype Fusion Pack. We are now polishing the next generation Fusion Pack with a few final tweaks. However, the CNC shop will not be able to help us take the next generation Fusion Pack to full manufacturing. Manufacturing can be costly and we need $40,000 to get the tooling all set up and do a first run of the next generation Fusion Pack. With your help we can get tooling set up and get the prototype of next generation fusion pack to manufacturing. Please support us and help us make the world truly powerful with fusion.Why we need your help:The Utah CNC shop was a great aid in helping us create a nice looking next generation prototype Fusion Pack.

<br/><h3>What is RobinCore ?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>         RobinCore is a tiny ARM Computer with WIFI
runs openWRT, it uses a high integration SOC Hi3518E(ARM926@440MHz) from the
HiSilicon and a powerful WIFI chip(MT7601U),there is a H.264 encoder(720p@30fps) and 64MB DDR2 integrated in Hi3518E.RobinCore has a 16MB NOR
Flash,USB2UART chip,it provides many interfaces such as 10/100M
Ethernet,UART,I2C,SPI,SDIO,ADC,PWM,JTAG and GPIOs,but its size is about 1.38 square inch
(33 X 27 mm), the interface spacing is 2.0mm,and the USB interface is used for a
USB2UART debug port and power supply,so,Just need an ordinary USB cable,we can
easily develop software with robincore.<b>   <br/></b></p>

<h2>                           Sad2Happy Social</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>             Sad2Happy app is a social media app with the focus on certain people dealing with a sad episode on their life, they will be able to make friends with people dealing with the same situation, in other words, to help those people who are going through a sad episode in their life to interact and connect with other people who may be in the same situation so in that way they can freely have a conversation about their problems, become friends, create a group, share ideas and meet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>             Our vision is to help two or more people who may be in the same situation or having the same problem to get connected, interact, have a conversation about their problems, meet and make friends. By doing that, those people who are in a state of loneliness, sadness or even depression, will get their need and the urge to talk to someone who may have gone through the same situation and talk about their problems, fulfilled.</p> <p>             The main reason behind it, is that even when someone who feels sad, feel lonely or even get to the point to have depression have these feelings and urge to talk to someone, a person who can understand them, or at least to hear what their problems are about, because even if a person who is going through a sad episode in their and say they just want to be alone or that they don't wish to talk to anyone, they don't really mean it, the reason is because of what the other person is going to think about them.</p> <p>              The reality is that they don't go out and just want to be inside their homes alone but, one thing we have to take into account, is that thanks to the rapid advancement of the technology and the ability to connect to people without going out, when they are alone, they always would have their smartphones with them and that they go through apps looking at funny videos to feel better but, they make a comment in the comment section expressing their feeling with hope that maybe someone may comment back with positive massage like: “i know how you feel”, “i hope you feel better” or “ is there a way we could connect so maybe to can tell me what wrong?”. So these are the main points the Sad2Happy app wants to cover and to focus more on people who are going through a sad episode in their life to connect with more people or even specialists who can understand their feelings because they feel the same way, make new friends and create a better social life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>                     Effect on people's lives.</h2>
<p><br/>             The Sad2Happy app will help lower the rates and percentages of people dealing with sadness, loneliness or even depression, by creating a network among users who can talk to each other about their situation they are in or the problem they are dealing with.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>                            It's Functionality</h2> <p>                                   The app will have the ability to do the following:</p> <p>1)The user will be able to create their own profiles.</p>
<p>2)Looking up someone to talk to by using a Hashtag (#) ex: #sad as result, there will be a list of users looking up the same hashtag.</p>
<p>3)The user will have the option to send a brief message, add as a friend and see previous status updates, based on their privacy settings.</p>
<p>4)The user will be able to update status, with the ability to change its privacy settings</p>
<p>5)The app will have a settings button where the user will be able to find the following options; Account settings, friends, and the Help button and more.</p>
<p>6)It will also include the User agreement section so the user can review it.</p>
<br/><br/> <p>The users will benefit from the use of this app by decreasing their sad episode in their life, having many options on the app, having the opportunity to talk to other people about their problems or their situation, because all they want is some to talk to, and also making friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>                        Our vision and goal</h2> <p>From the moment people start using the Sad2Happy app, to 5 years, we expect big changes by decreasing the rates of people dealing with sadness, loneliness or even depression, because the user will finally be connected on a social media that is more focused to their situation and feelings, and may even work better than the other regular apps that exist out there who don't  have the focus on their situation, so we are giving our users that opportunity</p> <p>Our goal is to change the worldwide rates and percentages of people dealing with a sad episode in their life and to lower the percentages of people diagnosed with major depression.</p> <p>What makes our social media app different than others?, Is that we are more focused on people’s feelings, on connecting people who feel lonely, creating real-life friendships between people who can understand each other, we have the goal to lower the worldwide reports of people dealing with depression and with possibility to also lower the suicide rates within only 5 years.</p>

By doing that, those people who are in a state of loneliness, sadness or even depression, will get their need and the urge to talk to someone who may have gone through the same situation and talk about their problems, fulfilled.              The main reason behind it, is that even when someone who feels sad, feel lonely or even get to the point to have depression have these feelings and urge to talk to someone, a person who can understand them, or at least to hear what their problems are about, because even if a person who is going through a sad episode in their and say they just want to be alone or that they don't wish to talk to anyone, they don't really mean it, the reason is because of what the other person is going to think about them.               The reality is that they don't go out and just want to be inside their homes alone but, one thing we have to take into account, is that thanks to the rapid advancement of the technology and the ability to connect to people without going out, when they are alone, they always would have their smartphones with them and that they go through apps looking at funny videos to feel better but, they make a comment in the comment section expressing their feeling with hope that maybe someone may comment back with positive massage like: “i know how you feel”, “i hope you feel better” or “ is there a way we could connect so maybe to can tell me what wrong?”. So these are the main points the Sad2Happy app wants to cover and to focus more on people who are going through a sad episode in their life to connect with more people or even specialists who can understand their feelings because they feel the same way, make new friends and create a better social life.
 
 
                     Effect on people's lives.
             The Sad2Happy app will help lower the rates and percentages of people dealing with sadness, loneliness or even depression, by creating a network among users who can talk to each other about their situation they are in or the problem they are dealing with.
 
                            It's Functionality                                    The app will have the ability to do the following: 1)The user will be able to create their own profiles.
2)Looking up someone to talk to by using a Hashtag (#) ex: #sad as result, there will be a list of users looking up the same hashtag.
3)The user will have the option to send a brief message, add as a friend and see previous status updates, based on their privacy settings.
4)The user will be able to update status, with the ability to change its privacy settings
5)The app will have a settings button where the user will be able to find the following options; Account settings, friends, and the Help button and more.
6)It will also include the User agreement section so the user can review it.
 The users will benefit from the use of this app by decreasing their sad episode in their life, having many options on the app, having the opportunity to talk to other people about their problems or their situation, because all they want is some to talk to, and also making friends.
 
                        Our vision and goal From the moment people start using the Sad2Happy app, to 5 years, we expect big changes by decreasing the rates of people dealing with sadness, loneliness or even depression, because the user will finally be connected on a social media that is more focused to their situation and feelings, and may even work better than the other regular apps that exist out there who don't  have the focus on their situation, so we are giving our users that opportunity Our goal is to change the worldwide rates and percentages of people dealing with a sad episode in their life and to lower the percentages of people diagnosed with major depression. What makes our social media app different than others?, Is that we are more focused on people’s feelings, on connecting people who feel lonely, creating real-life friendships between people who can understand each other, we have the goal to lower the worldwide reports of people dealing with depression and with possibility to also lower the suicide rates within only 5 years.

</div></div>","THE JUICERThe Juicer is a dual sided charging device that allows you to transfer battery power from one Android to another. It's the most convenient way for you to charge your phone when there isn't an outlet around. We found the market was filled with pricey charger cases and external power packs that were bulky and tough to carry around. We saw an opportunity to create something slim, an accessory that could go where you and other Android users go. Think of the Juicer as jumper cables for your keychain. THE PROBLEMOur phones can always use a charge. But there isn’t always a free outlet nearby, or a charger handy. Sometimes all we just need is a quick 5 or 10% to make a call or send a few texts. But what if our friends could be the lifeline to give us the power we need to send a text or make a call? The Juicer is first to market in the United States and we’re proud to debut the product after two years of product design, re-tooling and testing. It’s the world’s smallest, thinnest and lightest phone-to-phone charger, fitting conveniently on a keyring or inside a purse.


Ways to Share the Power: How it Works
 
You can also share the power from your own tablet. 


Charging Rate
Charges at the same speed as if you were plugged into the USB port of your computer.

<h3>The BestBoy Story</h3><p>It all began a long time ago with a poor software engineer (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/augustbering"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">August</a>) getting a bout of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_Strain_Injury"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Repetitive Strain Injury</a>
 from sitting in front of the computer too much. What on earth are we 
thinking, building state of the art soft- and hardware designed after 
century-old technology? The QWERTY keyboard <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY_keyboard#History_and_purposes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">is from the 1800′s</a> and the “modern” mouse from the 1970′s, sure we could do better, considering <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moore’s law</a> guiding other development?</p>
<p>The first approach to solve my problem was a crude device made out of 
toilet rolls, attached to each other with a chord, much like the 
Nintendo Wii remotes. While this was great, especially from an aesthetic
 point, it meant putting the device down and taking it up as soon the 
phone rang or the tea water boiled.</p>
<h4>The tablets</h4>I forgot about the project for some time, but then <a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/01/27Apple-Launches-iPad.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">came the iPad</a>. What a great gadget! You could use it almost like a real computer, except you couldn’t do any real work with it of course. That on-screen keyboard was a real pain for someone knowing how to touch-type. I wanted tactile feedback, and touch screens are bad at that.<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/517893/files/20140418123958-BB_prototype_1.JPG?1397849998"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>BestBoy iPad prototype, anno 2011.</i></p>
<p>I got some help from a couple of friends and we built the 
first version of BestBoy for the iPad 2. It was beautiful, complicated 
and expensive. Featuring a microprocessor, Bluetooth and real mechanical
 buttons, it was a really cool device. And of course, pinning an 
additional computer on the back of a tablet computer always sounds like a
 great idea to a computer guy like myself.
</p>
<p>But still, at this time, we made a promotion video for our 
product and BestBoy was featured in the Swedish magazine MacWorld, and 
the article is still <a href=""http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.413477/svensken-som-vill-ge-ipad-knappar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">available online</a> (in Swedish).</p>
<h4>The downfall</h4>
<p>
The BestBoy 1.0 would be too expensive, clunky and it would need to be 
charged. We were having serious doubts about our baby and how to 
proceed. People want their smartphone or tablet to be thin, and we would
 add some 5 mm to the thickness. Not good.
</p>
<h4>A new hope</h4>
<p>For eons we dwelled on our misfortune. What about the plans for a new, 
better world? Then one foggy night, on a desolate field in the darkest, 
most forsaken part of Sweden, I had an idea! We already got a great, 
touch sensitive screen on the phone. Why not try to extend that same 
area to the back of the device? Nobody have done it before, no, but that
 doesn’t mean it’s impossible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/517968/files/20140418130308-BestBoy-touch-Koncept7.jpg?1397851388"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>BestBoy touch concept sketch.</i></p>
<p>As it turned out, it was more or less impossible. We experimented with different materials and ways to use them, but never managed to get it working in the long run.... </p>
<p>Other, even more crazy ideas where tested and discarded. Let's just leave it at that.
</p>
<h4>The Bluetooth Empire strikes back</h4>
<p>Finally we had to abandon the touch based idea, and go back to the original idea with bluetooth and electronics. However, time has passed and new technology has emerged. Bluetooth Smart (or Low Energy) uses much less power than normal bluetooth, and was not available when the first BestBoy prototype was built. We also decided to not use mechanical buttons, since they are complicated and expensive.</p>

<p>So, just a couple of months later, we’re here. With a simple, thin, light Bluetooth LE based keyboard, with 6 simple touch buttons.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>BestBoy is ready for production – but in need of funding.</b></p><br/><h3>Revolution</h3>
<p>Within five years I don’t think people will have both laptop, smartphone and tablet. It’s absurd that we carry so much computing power in our smartphones, and still are unable to put it to real work. I read somewhere that people spend one and a half hours daily on their smartphones, painfully struggling to do what they do on their computers, just slower..</p>

 from sitting in front of the computer too much. What on earth are we 
thinking, building state of the art soft- and hardware designed after 
century-old technology? The QWERTY keyboard is from the 1800′s and the “modern” mouse from the 1970′s, sure we could do better, considering Moore’s law guiding other development?

 point, it meant putting the device down and taking it up as soon the 
phone rang or the tea water boiled.
The tabletsI forgot about the project for some time, but then came the iPad. What a great gadget! You could use it almost like a real computer, except you couldn’t do any real work with it of course. That on-screen keyboard was a real pain for someone knowing how to touch-type. I wanted tactile feedback, and touch screens are bad at that.
BestBoy iPad prototype, anno 2011.
I got some help from a couple of friends and we built the 
first version of BestBoy for the iPad 2. It was beautiful, complicated 
and expensive. Featuring a microprocessor, Bluetooth and real mechanical
 buttons, it was a really cool device. And of course, pinning an 
additional computer on the back of a tablet computer always sounds like a
 great idea to a computer guy like myself.

But still, at this time, we made a promotion video for our 
product and BestBoy was featured in the Swedish magazine MacWorld, and 
the article is still available online (in Swedish).
The downfall

The BestBoy 1.0 would be too expensive, clunky and it would need to be 
charged. We were having serious doubts about our baby and how to 
proceed. People want their smartphone or tablet to be thin, and we would
 add some 5 mm to the thickness. Not good.

A new hope
For eons we dwelled on our misfortune. What about the plans for a new, 
better world? Then one foggy night, on a desolate field in the darkest, 
most forsaken part of Sweden, I had an idea! We already got a great, 
touch sensitive screen on the phone. Why not try to extend that same 
area to the back of the device? Nobody have done it before, no, but that
 doesn’t mean it’s impossible.
BestBoy touch concept sketch.
As it turned out, it was more or less impossible. We experimented with different materials and ways to use them, but never managed to get it working in the long run.... 
Other, even more crazy ideas where tested and discarded. Let's just leave it at that.

The Bluetooth Empire strikes back
Finally we had to abandon the touch based idea, and go back to the original idea with bluetooth and electronics. However, time has passed and new technology has emerged. Bluetooth Smart (or Low Energy) uses much less power than normal bluetooth, and was not available when the first BestBoy prototype was built. We also decided to not use mechanical buttons, since they are complicated and expensive.
BestBoy concept image for tablet.
So, just a couple of months later, we’re here. With a simple, thin, light Bluetooth LE based keyboard, with 6 simple touch buttons.
BestBoy is ready for production – but in need of funding.Revolution
Within five years I don’t think people will have both laptop, smartphone and tablet. It’s absurd that we carry so much computing power in our smartphones, and still are unable to put it to real work. I read somewhere that people spend one and a half hours daily on their smartphones, painfully struggling to do what they do on their computers, just slower..
""So someone will revolutionize the world. Hopefully it’s me."" August Bering, creator of BestBoy

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This idea came to me naturally working with Mods and magnets and naturally drop down the phone. I don't have any experience about running campaign but I do like to learn new things and I love industrial design.</p>
<p>You will not be afraid to drop the phone again because it will not reach the ground. Spring load increase force gradually and slow down the drop.</p>
<p>You don't necessarily need this product. It is nice to have. Not every phone will break if it falls down and it becomes more personal with few dents. Like a custom series, like something special. Don't let me down will keep your phone always with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funds will go to cover tooling cost for high volume production insert molding for black piece on the bottom which carry magnet. Tooling is expensive for low volume production and to be able to have low cost on end product volume has to be high. In general, 1000 users can fund this campaign.  In case of not reach entire goal, you did let me down, but that is OK. No money will be taken.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you are the worker and do other thinks while talking on the phone this will help you not to drop the phone. Phone will not drop from your pocket while you sitting. If somebody else take your phone you will feel that. Just in case that you did pay to replace display it will not happen again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks always exist. Total risk is equal to times of all risks. Software engineers like to write less code. This is zero code. Hardware engineers like to use less components. This is zero component assembly. Mechanically this is very simple device, simple as it can be. I have made first model and first mold from melted plastic, as on picture above. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you know somebody that doesn't like to drop the phone use the Indiegogo share tools. Thank you!</p>

<h3>The Elroy Pitch</h3>
<p>The Pitch Most people struggle frequently with tangled earbud cords – an ongoing annoyance we would love to fix with a simple, compact technology. Elroy is exactly this. More than just another bluetooth connection to your phone, Elroy is a wearable speaker phone, a tangle-free set of earbuds, and a touch control for your mobile device.</p>
<p>Elroy is a whole new way to interface with your array of personal digital devices. Use Elroy as a simple wearable speaker phone. You don’t have to use the earbuds; you can take calls with a simple tap or send calls to voicemail with a swipe of your finger.</p>
<p>Use Elroy for nearly all your phone functions with intuitive touch gestures. Take calls, terminate calls, conference two calls, and more.</p>
<p>Elroy's unique magnetic earbud docks make answering a call as simple as possible. Just remove an earbud and talk. To hang up, replace the earbud on its dock. </p>
<p>Use Elroy as the controller for your external speakers. Adjust volume, advance tracks, pause, and play with easy-to-remember gestures. Elroy can be customized to reflect who you are.When you have an incoming call, don’t dash across the house to get to your phone – just tap to answer the call from where you are.</p>
<p>The front face plate is changeable, so you can switch colors to suit your mood or wardrobe. By the time Elroy gets to market, we will have hundreds of designs, patterns, and images to choose from.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Elroy is the brainchild of mass customization guru, Rob Honeycutt, the founder of the messenger bag company Timbuk2. Rob founded Timbuk2 in 1989 and created what is still a unique offering in the bag market with products that can be customized from millions of possible combinations, and then produced and shipped within 24 hours. It's a production system no other bag company has ever been able to replicate.</p>
<p>Rob ran manufacturing at Timbuk2 for 13 years and has over 20 years experience in many aspects of manufacturing, including injection molding, sourcing, cut&amp;sew, transportation, packaging, labeling systems, weaving and converting, and factory level production and process flow.</p>
<h3>Elroy is a product development project</h3>
<p>Elroy is the start of my next exploration into unknown entrepreneurial realms.</p>
<p>Just to be <strong>perfectly clear</strong>, the piece in the teaser video above is a non-functioning mock-up.  This project is currently in the product concept phase.    </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sniktech.com/elroy-mockup.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Image:  Current Elroy mock-up</em></p>
<p>To bring this product to market I'm partnering with <a href=""http://www.whizzsystems.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Whizz Systems</a>, an established electronics design and manufacturing contractor (EMC) with a solid, proven track record of bringing quality products to market. Whizz Systems brings 23 years of high tech experience to the table, consistently delivering the goods to some of the industry's biggest names. </p>
<p>Phase 1: We've laid out the expected functionality and performance of the product. On first pass, Whizz System's engineers say everything is achievable. Phase 1 of Elroy will be a thorough project planning with the Whizz engineers. This fundraising goal gets me through phase 1 of the project which will take only about 4-6 weeks. At that point we will have a complete set of functioning prototypes that will allow us to launch a phase 2 project to propel us through a product launch.</p>
<h3>What will Elroy do?</h3>
<p>First, we're doing something that's quite different than what's been attempted before.  We're combining bluetooth with touch pad technology, and then adding mass customization.</p>
<p>Fuctionality will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single touch commands for answering or muting calls, pausing or starting music tracks, and other actions.</li>
<li>Slide commands that will send incoming calls to voicemail, adjust music volume,  and other actions.</li>
<li>Touch &amp; hold commands to access Siri or other voice related actions.</li>
<li>Other multi-touch gestures will hold an unlimited potential for additional commands.</li>
<li>Use without earbuds so Elroy can function as a speaker phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a tremendous number of functions Elroy will eventually be able to perform.  I will be building a team of inside developers to explore what all we can make this thing do.</p>
<h3>Why is this the first ""truly wearable"" bluetooth device?</h3>
<p>On-the-ear and in-the-ear bluetooth devices are cumbersome. No matter how beautifully designed they are, most of us don't want hunks of plastic stuck in our ear all day.</p>
<p>A few bluetooth devices to clip on your clothing have appeared on the market too. We've tested them. We don't think they rise to level of something to wear, like a piece of jewelry. They look like little remote control units - functional, but lacking any style or personal identity.</p>
<p>Elroy is a device that you will wear all day long. It's a simple form that will perform more functions than any other similar device. It's a concept that can adapt to your personality. We don't want you to wear Elroy because it says something about us. We want you to wear Elroy because it says something about you. That's what makes Elroy ""truly wearable.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>A word on mass customization</h3>
<p>One of the best parts of Timbuk2 was the mass customization system I built.  What I loved about it, and what endures today, is how personal people's Timbuk2 bags become when they create them themselves.  I want to bring an element of that magic to Elroy by adding customization.  I want this to be more than just another little clicky device.  I want Elroy to be something you love.</p>
<h3>Your funding</h3>
<p>With your help I can bring this new and unique device to market.  I hope you will find the idea as complelling as I do.  </p>

Animodula is an animal making bracelet: one Animodula package with 22 pieces, the Triceratops, is able to represent all the figures obtained in the picture below (the ""bestiary"", 130 animals) and many others. Animodula lets you build creatures of your imagination and gives you little 3D puzzle to solve: both this things contribute in the development of your life skills, it doesn't matter what your age is.Animal making demo:StoryAt the beginning my objective was the making of a polymer clay bracelet that could become an animal once took off, but afterwads I have developed the beads in modules to let them combine in a high number of animals. After an intermediate wooden prototype I shifted to a 3D printed one, perfectly working both as a toy and a bracelet: the final product is ready to be realized in plastic through injection molding. In addition to this version there is also another one, in steel, 3D printed.Animodula has been designed to produce many significant combinations in correlation to the number of pieces, as the space on the wrist is limited.AnimodulaI will describe now plastic and steel Animodula. There are 5 shapes of piece. Trapezoids, Triangles and three extremities: Drop, Horn and Nose cone. The trapezoid module's base, in the plastic version, is 26 mm length (~1""), a bit less considering the bevel, while the steel version's one is 20 mm length (0.79""). The hole for the wire has a 2mm diameter. The plastic modules appear as a couple of shells closed on the magnets, while the steel version is a single hollow piece with external magnets.There are 3 packages: Kitten, Turtle and Triceratops, and they have respectively 8, 14, and 22 pieces. The triceratops is obtained from the Kitten's pieces added to the Turtle's ones.The plastic version is available in 6 plain colors and 6 fantasy materials inspired to the natural elements.Plain colors: Ivory, Lime, Sapphire, Purple, Coral, Orange; Fantasy colors: Lava, Water, Night, Forest, Clouds, Daylight; all this 12 pictures are renderingsExample of the packaging that I would like to print for the Fantasy colors if the campaign will significantly exceed the strict goalIn the steel version there are 3 available finishes, natural (the production process leaves a light bronze color), nickel plated and black.Considering that the jewel is obtained by 3D printing several customizations are also available (see Perks paragraph)This photo shows the modules on 1cm-anty-paper.[WARNING! The ingestion of one or more magnets is extremely dangerous. Does not matter how old a kid is, if he swallows  things avoid Animodula][WARNING! Have you got nickel allergy? Avoid Nickel finishing on the jewel]Animodula is mainly thought to have a plesant looking when it is transported in bracelet configuration and to represent animals and organic shapes when in toy configuration. The high number of relevant shapes that can be made is given by the presence of magnetic joints on every face, and by the union of 60, 120 and 90° angles, that can tile a plane. The 60 and 120° angles are pretty common in nature, for example in the beehive's cells and in the monocotyledons. The magnetic joints are adjustable so the finished creatures keep an high mobility, and are employable as action figures in other games.The presence of magnets allows Animodula to cling to metallic walls, such as the computer case or as the fridge. In addition it can interact with small objects such coins, keys, hair claps or paper clips. In this way Animodula can become the source of endless games.Neotenia ProjectAnimodula is part of a greater project, Neotenia, which includes another dozen subprojects.

</div></div>","We are pleased to introduce MagTarget™ a wireless charging system for your smartphone and tablets. It securely holds your device with no clips and no clamps. It wirelessly charges your devices without plugging the phone into anything. No wires on your phone or tablet! We have been working for two years and gone through hundreds of prototypes to achieve the development of our patent pending technology that allows you to simply attach a Target Ring to your device (with or without cases), and touch to charge.

A clever magnet arrangement allows the device to find the dock without any careful alignment needed. Our mounts have an amazingly strong magnetic pull for a secure hold, yet easy to remove (your phone or tablet) with a simple twist. Your device will be in the perfect viewing position, with 360 degree rotation you can change from portrait to landscape while charging. MagTarget™ uses a direct electrical connection to give you the maximum charging speed. Your device will have the added benefit of longer battery life, the battery type used in most modern electronics (Lithium-ion) actually benefit from frequent recharge. MagTarget™ keeps your smart devices charged throughout the day with a simple touch of the dock. No wires to plug-in every time.

<p class=""p1"">Our city was hit by an earthquake two years ago. The fieldworkers have been using iPads to record the earthquake damage as they work around the city. We've been repairing these iPads after they've been damaged. Most damage occurs when they are dropped - even though the iPads are kept in 'protective' cases.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's clear that these cases aren't doing a great job of protecting the iPads.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So, we designed and built an iPad drop-test rig in a lab at local University testing facilities. Over a period of 6 months we dropped iPads thousands of times in many different protective cases and sleeves.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Everything was controlled and measured - we placed strain gauges on the glass panel, measured the acceleration and used load cells to measure impact force. We even used an electromagnet to control the consistency of all the drop tests.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The results were interesting. It turns out that even the most rugged-looking cases are almost useless in protecting the iPads in a drop. In some cases you would be better off without a case on your iPad.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">A good protective case should have a small peak impact force. The smaller this peak impact force, the less damage the iPad is likely to sustain. The peak impact force can be seen as the sharp downwards spike on the left-hand side of the load cell output charts below.</p>
<p class=""p1""><em><img alt=""Otterbox Load Cell"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/fullstop/otterboxloadcell.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Otterbox Load Cell""/></em></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Based on these results we thought we could make a better protective system to help prevent iPad damage. We've spent the last year designing and developing the best iPad protection system in the world. We call it Fullstop for iPad.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Fullstop for iPad provides full and easy access to all the iPad ports and cameras. Fullstop features a hand strap on the back which fieldworkers love - it makes it easy to hold the iPad, and helps prevent the iPad slipping out of your hand.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fullstop leaves almost 90% of the iPad surface area open so that Apple’s gorgeous design isn't compromised. It's simply maximum protection with minimum bulk (amazing, huh?). The protection system weighs a mere 126g, that's around one third of the weight of comparable drop protection cases.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We've drop-tested Fullstop using the same testing rig (complete with load cells, strain gauges and accelerometers) to verify the performance of Fullstop protection system exceeded that of other protective cases.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><img alt=""Impact Force"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/fullstop/Impactforce.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Impact Force""/></p>
<p><span class=""s1"">The red and blue curves at the bottom represent the impact force of Fullstop made from TPU and silicone. The flat shape of the curve means the Fullstop outperformed every other case by a significant margin.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">But we didn't stop there. We selected a specific shore hardness of silicone to provide a perfect balance between high shock absorbtion and great durability. </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We've spent the last twelve months developing, testing and prototyping the Fullstop protection system. We need your help to raise $9000 to assist us in initial production and tooling costs.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We're giving all contributors a chance to get their own Fullstop protection system from $29 delivered instead of the expected $49 retail price.</p>
<p>All contributors will receive a booklet telling our story, from initial testing, through to development and production of Fullstop. The booklet even has color pictures!</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>When is delivery scheduled?</h4>
<p>We expect to have your Fullstop protection system on your iPad in mid-February 2013. This is based on a realistic timeline (above) with reasonable contingency.</p>
<h4>What colors are available?</h4>
<p>The default colour is matte black. The <em>Fullstop:Color</em> range includes six colours which have yet to be finalised, but will be voted on before the end of the campaign.</p>
<h4>What happens if I drop my iPad face down?</h4>
<p>When an iPad is dropped it follows the path of least resistance - falling on an edge - which is protected by Fullstop.</p>
<h4>Where are the protection systems made?</h4>
<p>Fullstop has been designed in Christchurch, New Zealand and will be manufactured in Shenzhen, China.</p>

Everything was controlled and measured - we placed strain gauges on the glass panel, measured the acceleration and used load cells to measure impact force. We even used an electromagnet to control the consistency of all the drop tests.
 
    
The results were interesting. It turns out that even the most rugged-looking cases are almost useless in protecting the iPads in a drop. In some cases you would be better off without a case on your iPad.
A good protective case should have a small peak impact force. The smaller this peak impact force, the less damage the iPad is likely to sustain. The peak impact force can be seen as the sharp downwards spike on the left-hand side of the load cell output charts below.

 
Based on these results we thought we could make a better protective system to help prevent iPad damage. We've spent the last year designing and developing the best iPad protection system in the world. We call it Fullstop for iPad.
 
 
 
 
Fullstop for iPad

Fullstop for iPad provides full and easy access to all the iPad ports and cameras. Fullstop features a hand strap on the back which fieldworkers love - it makes it easy to hold the iPad, and helps prevent the iPad slipping out of your hand.
Fullstop leaves almost 90% of the iPad surface area open so that Apple’s gorgeous design isn't compromised. It's simply maximum protection with minimum bulk (amazing, huh?). The protection system weighs a mere 126g, that's around one third of the weight of comparable drop protection cases.
We've drop-tested Fullstop using the same testing rig (complete with load cells, strain gauges and accelerometers) to verify the performance of Fullstop protection system exceeded that of other protective cases.
 

The red and blue curves at the bottom represent the impact force of Fullstop made from TPU and silicone. The flat shape of the curve means the Fullstop outperformed every other case by a significant margin.
But we didn't stop there. We selected a specific shore hardness of silicone to provide a perfect balance between high shock absorbtion and great durability. 
 
What We Need
We've spent the last twelve months developing, testing and prototyping the Fullstop protection system. We need your help to raise $9000 to assist us in initial production and tooling costs.
What You Get
We're giving all contributors a chance to get their own Fullstop protection system from $29 delivered instead of the expected $49 retail price.
All contributors will receive a booklet telling our story, from initial testing, through to development and production of Fullstop. The booklet even has color pictures!
 
Production Timeline
 
About Us
We're a small and motivated team based in Christchurch, New Zealand who have a great track record. We run a successful iPad repair company, with branches across New Zealand and Australia. We've also developed our own range of iPhone accessories through voBack and distributed them to over forty countries.
For this project we've pulled in a wider team including engineers with expertise in impact mechanics and strong product development and testing experience.

FAQ
When is delivery scheduled?
We expect to have your Fullstop protection system on your iPad in mid-February 2013. This is based on a realistic timeline (above) with reasonable contingency.
What colors are available?
The default colour is matte black. The Fullstop:Color range includes six colours which have yet to be finalised, but will be voted on before the end of the campaign.
What happens if I drop my iPad face down?
When an iPad is dropped it follows the path of least resistance - falling on an edge - which is protected by Fullstop.
Where are the protection systems made?
Fullstop has been designed in Christchurch, New Zealand and will be manufactured in Shenzhen, China.

<h2>What is babuino?</h2>
<p>Babuino allows you to control your digital devices with your smatphone, in an easy way.</p>
<p>You just have to connect your babuino to a USB port of the device you want to control, and start our program on your phone</p>
<p>Connecting with babuino is trouble free and it does not need any configuration.</p>
<p>You can also control your smartphone from your computer (PC or Mac), now you can write your messages from a regular keyboard. It works in android devices, iPad and iPhone with jailbreak.</p>
<p> With babuino, you can use your smartphone to control lot of things, computers, toys, homemade electronics... and practically any digital device.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7442/9041070651_5af6d58d7d_o.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Who can use babuino?</h2>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>When we started developing babuino, we thought in people who just want to use our technology, without knowing anything about how does it works, but if you are interrested we will give you all information.</p>
<p>Babuino will be shipped as a 100% finished product, and it will come with lot of software to use it from minute one.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we want to offer a usefull and powerfull product for that people who want to make their own projects, so we developed babuino as a full open project.</p>
<p>We have to models, babuino stick and babuino board.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why are 2 versions of babuino?</h2>
<p>Well, these 2 versions of babuino are pretty similar.</p>
<p>Babuino stick comes on a transparent case (like a pendrive) so you can bring it with you everywhere. You have seen several of its uses on the promotional video.</p>
<p>Babuino board comes unboxed. It have accesible pins, so you can connect more electronic components to it. It´s a very small board, arduino compatible, bluetooth ready,  and with the power of the xmega microcontroller.</p>

What is babuino?
Babuino allows you to control your digital devices with your smatphone, in an easy way.
You just have to connect your babuino to a USB port of the device you want to control, and start our program on your phone
Connecting with babuino is trouble free and it does not need any configuration.
You can also control your smartphone from your computer (PC or Mac), now you can write your messages from a regular keyboard. It works in android devices, iPad and iPhone with jailbreak.
 With babuino, you can use your smartphone to control lot of things, computers, toys, homemade electronics... and practically any digital device.
 
 
 
Who can use babuino?
Everybody.
When we started developing babuino, we thought in people who just want to use our technology, without knowing anything about how does it works, but if you are interrested we will give you all information.
Babuino will be shipped as a 100% finished product, and it will come with lot of software to use it from minute one.
But at the same time, we want to offer a usefull and powerfull product for that people who want to make their own projects, so we developed babuino as a full open project.
We have to models, babuino stick and babuino board.
 
 
Why are 2 versions of babuino?
Well, these 2 versions of babuino are pretty similar.
Babuino stick comes on a transparent case (like a pendrive) so you can bring it with you everywhere. You have seen several of its uses on the promotional video.
Babuino board comes unboxed. It have accesible pins, so you can connect more electronic components to it. It´s a very small board, arduino compatible, bluetooth ready,  and with the power of the xmega microcontroller.

If you do not know which one to choose, we suggest babuino stick, or even better, both.
Both versions have basically the same hardware, so don´t worry about which is better, because they are equal. You just have to decide, if you want babuino with a case (stick) or without case and accesible ports (board).
 
 
Open source, firmware and hardware

All software that you have seen in the video is open source, so you can modify or use as a base for your projects, even for commercial projects.
Smartphone's programs are for the android platform.
Desktop's programs have versions for Windows, Mac and Linux
The firmware is open source too.
 
 
Arduino compatibility

Babuino is a 100% Arduino compatible board.
Our firmware is based on LUFA. You will be able to use your arduino sketches with Babunino, because it's an arduino compatible board with integrated bluetooth. 
 
 
What do we need?
We have done a lot, but there is much more to be done.
We have done the first prototypes, but we need more prototypes before babuino is ready for production.
We have lot of software for babuino under development. We use it, and we love it, but we know there is much to be done before it reach the quality we want it to have.
We know this is a fantastic product, and we want to make it available for everybody for a great price, so we need your contribution to make a large production.
We love our project, and we hope you like it, if so, please get involved, support us.

<h3>Why We Are Using Indiegogo</h3>
<div>Development and mass production of Hackey has been completed and the first batch of Hackeys are now in the warehouse ready to be shipped.</div>
<div>We will sell Hackey no matter whether this campaign succeeds or not but we want to use Indiegogo to help spread the news about Hackey to wider audience. With the wide range of successful connected devices backed on Indiegogo we feel Hackey is ideally suited to launch on Indiegogo and we hope that our backers and first users will help spread word about Hackey from Indiegogo to the world.</div>

Why We Are Using Indiegogo
Development and mass production of Hackey has been completed and the first batch of Hackeys are now in the warehouse ready to be shipped.
We will sell Hackey no matter whether this campaign succeeds or not but we want to use Indiegogo to help spread the news about Hackey to wider audience. With the wide range of successful connected devices backed on Indiegogo we feel Hackey is ideally suited to launch on Indiegogo and we hope that our backers and first users will help spread word about Hackey from Indiegogo to the world.",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>Who and What is JailBase?</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.jailbase.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""JailBase Homepage"">JailBase</a> is a free website that provides jail arrest photos, jail information, and arrest notifications to the general public. My name is James, and I am the founder of JailBase. I started the site three years ago because I had a family need for timely and accurate jail arrest information, but it just wasn't available. I felt there had to be a better way, and decided to create a fast and efficient online database of my local county jail using public records. Today, JailBase collects data from <a href=""http://www.jailbase.com/en/sources/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""JailBase Counties"">over 160 counties</a> all across the US, and we continue to grow every month.</p>
<h2>

<h2>Explain the Budget</h2>
<p>Software development is not an issue for us. I myself have over 15 years of development experience in addition to managing the development of JailBase. Most of our budget will be going towards two things. One will be the licensing for the facial recognition software. The second will be the graphic design of the mobile app so it will function smoothly and look professional.</p>
<p>If we double our funding goal, we plan to add additional features to the app. One of those features will be Face Notification. This will allow you to <strong>save</strong> a face to search for, and if someone who matches that face is arrested in the future, we will notify you.</p>
<h2>
<br/>Pricing of the Mobile App</h2>
<p>JailBase has always provided a free service to the public with our website. The mobile app will be free also, however the free version will have advertisements and usage will be limited. Advertisements can be turned off and additional usage can be bought by purchasing credits. As a backer, you have the potential to get unlimited use of the application and no in-app advertising.</p>

<p>The idea for the VoltWerks power supply came from the realization that neither my expensive HP/Agilent power supply, nor my low-cost lab supply were a good fit for many of my development requirements. With a traditional bench supply it is easy to accidentally or thoughtlessly mess with the settings and set the wrong voltage.  </p>
<p>Here's the list of design objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>No clunky knobs, but also no programming or keypads.</li>
<li>Precision adjustment to 10mV or better.</li>
<li>Current trip, not current limit.  If the current exceeds the set-point, I want power cut, not limited.</li>
<li>Small and low-cost</li>
<li>Low-noise.  Many of the adjustable lab supplies today are switch-mode and are too noisy when working with analog stages such as ADCs.</li>
</ul><p>The VW1 design has hit all these goals and more.</p>
<p>Now, with your backing, VoltWerks VW1 will start shipping and appearing on a lab bench near you!</p>
<p></p><h3>ABOUT REVELY MICROSYSTEMS</h3>
<p>Revely Microsystems was started in 2003 to create development boards for ARM microprocessors - shipping our products to over 30 different countries. </p>
<p>Revely Microsystems is located in Austin, Texas and the VoltWerks project is very Austin-centric.  Our industrial design and board assembly partners are both local.  We benefit greatly from the high-tech talent and energy found in Austin.</p><p>The VW1 power supply will be the first in a long line of innovative VoltWerks lab products from Revely Microsystems.<br/></p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">RISKS AND CHALLENGES</span><br/>
</h3>
<h4>The Product</h4>
<p>The characterization of prototypes is complete but there's still the possibility of a late feature or specification change (for better or worse).  Frankly the product design is pretty simple compared to most of the embedded products I’ve designed so the product risks are low. </p>
<h4>Tooling</h4>
<p>Having been through this before, there's always a risk for delay if the T0 molded parts aren't right.  The enclosure design is deliberately simple, so any delays should be in weeks, not months.</p>
<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
<p>The biggest risk in manufacturing is component lead-times.  As a hedge, inventory of several key components has already been purchased.  Even with good planning, component lead-times beyond our control may delay volume order fulfillment.</p>
<p></p><h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>
<p></p><h4>Can I control the VoltWerks Model 1 using USB?</h4>
<p>No, the VW1 does not have communication interfaces.  The USB connector is only used for 5V power input.  While USB programmability was a consideration, the design objectives were simplicity and foolproof operation.  The end product is essentially an analog design.  The MCU is used for the LCD readouts and system management and does not control regulation.</p>
<p></p><h4>Can I power VW1 directly from a vehicle 12V supply?</h4>
<p>Yes. However some degree of protection from the extreme conditions seen on an automotive 12V system is preferable, especially for permanent installations. Input protection to the VW1 might include a fuse, additional transient voltage suppressor, and/or a pre-regulator if low-noise output under all conditions is required. If your 'vehicle' is a robot powered by a 12V SLA battery, then there are no special considerations.</p>
<p></p><h4>Since it is a linear regulator, does the VW1 get hot?</h4>
<p>Depending on the input voltage, output voltage and load current the VW1 heat-sink can get quite hot.  The VW1 power-supply uses a linear regulator to control voltage. A linear regulator is essentially a big power resistor with a dynamically regulated resistance.  The power loss is the difference between the supply voltage and the output voltage multiplied by the current P = (Vin-Vout) x Iload.  Linear power regulators are generally less efficient than switching power supplies, but offer superior noise, ripple and start-up characteristics. </p>

The VoltWerks linear supply provides adjustable DC power for lab and system use. No clunky knobs and a fast current trip keep accurate power available exactly when it's needed.
Precision comes from dual 25-turn trimmers for accurate and dependable voltage and current-trip adjustment.  The low-noise linear regulator has less than 2mV p-p output noise, a level of performance not found on low-cost power supplies.

SAVE MONEY AND REDUCE WASTE
Most of us have a box of old AC power adapters, salvaged from lost or broken electronic devices.  VoltWerks lets you upcycle the adapters into useful lab equipment for your next project.  Almost any AC adapter with a DC output from 5-15V is a candidate for providing input power to the VoltWerks VW1.  
The User Manual documentation will have simple instructions for making the conversion.  Save yourself money and reduce waste!
REWARDSCURRENT STATUS
After several prototype generations the VoltWerks VW1 design is up, running, and fully functional.
We have 3D printed enclosures and characterization of the final prototype is complete.  Small firmware, mechanical, and circuit adjustments are in progress:  tweaking details that matter, like LED brightness.  The final steps are hard-tooling for the enclosure and full-scale manufacturing.  
ABOUT VOLTWERKS
The idea for the VoltWerks power supply came from the realization that neither my expensive HP/Agilent power supply, nor my low-cost lab supply were a good fit for many of my development requirements. With a traditional bench supply it is easy to accidentally or thoughtlessly mess with the settings and set the wrong voltage.  
Here's the list of design objectives:

No clunky knobs, but also no programming or keypads.
Precision adjustment to 10mV or better.
Current trip, not current limit.  If the current exceeds the set-point, I want power cut, not limited.
Small and low-cost
Low-noise.  Many of the adjustable lab supplies today are switch-mode and are too noisy when working with analog stages such as ADCs.
The VW1 design has hit all these goals and more.
Now, with your backing, VoltWerks VW1 will start shipping and appearing on a lab bench near you!
ABOUT REVELY MICROSYSTEMS
Revely Microsystems was started in 2003 to create development boards for ARM microprocessors - shipping our products to over 30 different countries. 
Revely Microsystems is located in Austin, Texas and the VoltWerks project is very Austin-centric.  Our industrial design and board assembly partners are both local.  We benefit greatly from the high-tech talent and energy found in Austin.The VW1 power supply will be the first in a long line of innovative VoltWerks lab products from Revely Microsystems.
ABOUT THE TEAM
The team right now is me, Jon Guy.  Of course I'm supported by some first-class contractors and partners for design and manufacturing, as well as advisors, family and friends.
I've been leading teams and designing products for over 20 years, in both established companies like Texas Instruments and Fisher&Paykel, but also with multiple start-up companies.  I've lead teams and been hands-on with in a wide range of applications including motor control, automation of factories/buildings/horticultural equipment, wearables, and semiconductors.  Big project or small, I love to make it happen.

TIMELINE

RISKS AND CHALLENGES

The Product
The characterization of prototypes is complete but there's still the possibility of a late feature or specification change (for better or worse).  Frankly the product design is pretty simple compared to most of the embedded products I’ve designed so the product risks are low. 
Tooling
Having been through this before, there's always a risk for delay if the T0 molded parts aren't right.  The enclosure design is deliberately simple, so any delays should be in weeks, not months.
Manufacturing
The biggest risk in manufacturing is component lead-times.  As a hedge, inventory of several key components has already been purchased.  Even with good planning, component lead-times beyond our control may delay volume order fulfillment.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Can I control the VoltWerks Model 1 using USB?
No, the VW1 does not have communication interfaces.  The USB connector is only used for 5V power input.  While USB programmability was a consideration, the design objectives were simplicity and foolproof operation.  The end product is essentially an analog design.  The MCU is used for the LCD readouts and system management and does not control regulation.
Can I power VW1 directly from a vehicle 12V supply?
Yes. However some degree of protection from the extreme conditions seen on an automotive 12V system is preferable, especially for permanent installations. Input protection to the VW1 might include a fuse, additional transient voltage suppressor, and/or a pre-regulator if low-noise output under all conditions is required. If your 'vehicle' is a robot powered by a 12V SLA battery, then there are no special considerations.
Since it is a linear regulator, does the VW1 get hot?
Depending on the input voltage, output voltage and load current the VW1 heat-sink can get quite hot.  The VW1 power-supply uses a linear regulator to control voltage. A linear regulator is essentially a big power resistor with a dynamically regulated resistance.  The power loss is the difference between the supply voltage and the output voltage multiplied by the current P = (Vin-Vout) x Iload.  Linear power regulators are generally less efficient than switching power supplies, but offer superior noise, ripple and start-up characteristics. 
An internal temperature sensor will signal a fault condition if a safe limit is exceeded.

<p><b>How did
this idea originate?</b></p>
<p>Often times at home we find it frustrating getting everyone to
arrive around the dinner table on time, or are so tied up with work and forget
to say goodnight to our loved ones.  We dont believe that we are
communicating as effective or efficiently as we would like. We are connecting
with one another via cellphones, yelling or nomadically meeting with each other
which can become physically and financially straining, depending on the
individual. If you have messy hands from working or cooking dinner, are busy,
have a disability, or just plain lazy, we don't always want or can leave our
work space or push multiple buttons and wait patiently to connect on a cell
phone to communicate. We thought there must be an easier way to communicate
more efficiently and that wasn't as bulky, ugly and pricey as today’s intercom
systems. This was our spark! We had thought to expand this idea of easier
communication and to include functions that are also extremely useful; for
instance the relevant temperature, sound activated functions for the dirty busy
hands, and broadcast mode to communicate up to eight individuals in eight
separate rooms inside and outside of the home or work place. If anyone is like
ourselves, we think you’ll love the Clockee Talkee!</p>

<p>The Clockee Talkee consists of nine main parts. These items are
the transmitter, receiver, crystal, speaker, microphone, LED, clock IC,
thermometer, and power source.  The transmitter sends your voice, after it
has been made into a radio signal, to the other Clockee-Talkee you are
communicating with. The receiver picks up the radio signal that the transmitter
from the other Clockee Talkee sent. The crystal sets the frequency or channels
that the Clockee Talkee's using.  They must be on the same frequency to
communicate. The speaker is the part that takes the signal picked up by the
receiver and amplifies it, so that it is loud enough to be heard. The
microphone is the part that you speak into, and it converts your voice into an
electronic signal. It is the exact opposite of the speaker which converts
electronic signals into voices.  The LED (light emitting diode) is the
display in which you can see the time and menu functions.  LED’s have a
very long life expectancy and can be made in an array of colors.  Clock IC
(input control) is essentially the brain of the clock, keeps the time and sets
the alarms.  The thermometer reads the temperature of any give room or
area. The power source is a type of battery or AC current being used.</p>

the veneer finish as shown in the below pictures.  A diode is used as the
talk button to allow a slight glow effect when pressed.  When completing
prototypes it is very difficult and costly to produce a final design product as
the mold is incomplete.  Rest assured that we will deliver a stellar
looking piece. </p>

this phase we will integrate our PCB (circuit board) into one compact

costly process that allows manufacturers to produce one product in mass
quantity (kind of like a muffin tray). </p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Hi Indiegogo my name is Milad Modir and it has been my dream to present to you the Clockee Talkee. After completing a three year advanced diploma in Wireless Communications &amp; Network at Humber College, I further perused my educational career at Ryerson University completing a Bachelors of Commerce focusing on Telecommunications and Information Technology Management. After successfully working several years in various positions at Bell, Canada’s top telecommunications company, I finally decided to succumbed to my entrepreneurial itch and pioneered the first ever wearable multimedia OLED name tag, formally known as the SuperSales Tag. Recently, you may have seen me on the hit CBC-TV show Dragons Den where I had received $.1 million based on the success of my SuperSales Tag invention. It has received rave reviews and continues to sell as a hot commodity. I fully expect to do the same with the Clockee Talkee; delivering unique, high performance efficient communication products like we have been doing for the past 8 years!</p>

Clockee Talkee: clock radios and walkie-talkie: If you are in search of an alarm clock - @IT_SKILL_CENTER


An innovative revolutionary intercommunication alarm clock, modernly designed with every user and setting in mind.













There isn't anything confusing about this equation! The Clockee Talkee provides functions such as a Walkie-Talkie, alarm clock, thermometer, sound activation and other capabilities like power saving and broadcast mode!

Why do you need a Clockee Talkee?
Everyone needs a Clockee Talkee! This revolutionary design is perfect for the everyday ordinary and unique lifestyles. Not only does the Clockee Talkee provide a modern sleek wood grain design, the applications are unlimited! You'll be sure to have faster more efficient communication throughout your workplace or home once you receive your very own Clockee Talkee... Guaranteed! Lets look at some settings where the Clockee Talkee is useful!












How did
this idea originate?
Often times at home we find it frustrating getting everyone to
arrive around the dinner table on time, or are so tied up with work and forget
to say goodnight to our loved ones.  We dont believe that we are
communicating as effective or efficiently as we would like. We are connecting
with one another via cellphones, yelling or nomadically meeting with each other
which can become physically and financially straining, depending on the
individual. If you have messy hands from working or cooking dinner, are busy,
have a disability, or just plain lazy, we don't always want or can leave our
work space or push multiple buttons and wait patiently to connect on a cell
phone to communicate. We thought there must be an easier way to communicate
more efficiently and that wasn't as bulky, ugly and pricey as today’s intercom
systems. This was our spark! We had thought to expand this idea of easier
communication and to include functions that are also extremely useful; for
instance the relevant temperature, sound activated functions for the dirty busy
hands, and broadcast mode to communicate up to eight individuals in eight
separate rooms inside and outside of the home or work place. If anyone is like
ourselves, we think you’ll love the Clockee Talkee!



Under The
Hood

The Clockee Talkee consists of nine main parts. These items are
the transmitter, receiver, crystal, speaker, microphone, LED, clock IC,
thermometer, and power source.  The transmitter sends your voice, after it
has been made into a radio signal, to the other Clockee-Talkee you are
communicating with. The receiver picks up the radio signal that the transmitter
from the other Clockee Talkee sent. The crystal sets the frequency or channels
that the Clockee Talkee's using.  They must be on the same frequency to
communicate. The speaker is the part that takes the signal picked up by the
receiver and amplifies it, so that it is loud enough to be heard. The
microphone is the part that you speak into, and it converts your voice into an
electronic signal. It is the exact opposite of the speaker which converts
electronic signals into voices.  The LED (light emitting diode) is the
display in which you can see the time and menu functions.  LED’s have a
very long life expectancy and can be made in an array of colors.  Clock IC
(input control) is essentially the brain of the clock, keeps the time and sets
the alarms.  The thermometer reads the temperature of any give room or
area. The power source is a type of battery or AC current being used.

IN THE
EARLY DAYS
Welcome to Earth, Clockee
Talkee!You've made it to
adulthood.

It's almost time....
It's time to send you off to the real world (tears)

The
Button
The Clockee Talkee button is something that we have been paying
very close attention to.  The Talk button will be finished in a seamless
and flush elegant look.  Our goal is to make all buttons to be as discrete
as possible.  The current state of the talk button is disguised beneath
the veneer finish as shown in the below pictures.  A diode is used as the
talk button to allow a slight glow effect when pressed.  When completing
prototypes it is very difficult and costly to produce a final design product as
the mold is incomplete.  Rest assured that we will deliver a stellar
looking piece. 






The
Line Up


     





STAINLESS SILVER COLOR

Clockee
Talkee - 101
How
does it work?
The Clockee talkee uses a simple yet effective FM
transmitter/receiver. You can use the Clockee Talkee anywhere.  It does
NOT require an internet connection or home networking router.  
Current
state of development
We have completed our working prototype capable of all the
functions listed above and shown in the video.  It has been a very long
journey reaching this stage and we are eager to complete this project.  We
have been fortunate to not have to reinvent the wheel as all the technologies
used in the Clockee Talkee are off the shelf parts.  Our unique
combination of design and simple technology assures our backer that we WILL
deliver on our promise.  We have our manufacturer ready to begin working
on the mold and PCB integration.  
The manufacturing process...


· 
Phase 1: Mold & Design Completion - During
this phase we will integrate our PCB (circuit board) into one compact
efficient design eliminating redundancy   The creation of the
mold will also take place during this stage.  The mold is a complex and
costly process that allows manufacturers to produce one product in mass
quantity (kind of like a muffin tray). 
· 
Phase 2: Compliance Testing & Certification - All
products that will be sold in North America and Europe
which emit radio frequency must go
through vigorous compliance testing governed by two
different bodies.  This is done to insure end users are safe and
that no frequency interference occurs with government infrastructure.
· 
Phase 3: Pre-production & quality control - At this
stage we will have a completely finished product and ready for a test
production run to insure the manufacture process will be smooth.  We then
initiate stringent quality control procedures (my specialty) to insure the
consistence and longevity of our product.
· 
Phase 4: Mass Production - The production line is
now at full capacity and we are continuously watching for any errors.  
· 
Phase 5: Packaging and Shipping - All
product is safely packed in insulated boxes and shipped via airfreight to our
distribution facility.  

Our manufacture has been in the electronics manufacturing market for
over 25 years, has a 60,000sqft warehouse in Shenzhen, China and employees 1200
workers.  I have conducted dealings with them several times in my previous
ventures (SuperSales Tag) (http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/Dragons'+Den/Pitches/ID/2383671247/?sort=MostRecent) and have been very impressed with their ability to meet deadlines
and conform to North American expectations.  Our current relationship is
in excellent standing.

<p><strong>iGR</strong> has been providing market research and information to the wireless &amp; mobile industry for the last 12 years. We need your help with a new project we call <strong>GlobalStats</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>GlobalStats</strong> is an iPad app that addresses one of the most fundamental problems industry professionals face today: Getting to data and stats quickly and efficiently. For research providers such as iGR, the issue is typically one of distribution. We have a great deal of data, forecasts and statistics that are valuable to the industry, but we have no way to deliver the data to a mobile device.  <strong>GlobalStats</strong> addresses this problem.</p>
<p>Our project is simple: Build the <strong>GlobalStats</strong> iPad app and provide updates to the information for 12 months.  <strong>GlobalStats</strong> will provide a new way to access survey data, market forecasts and other statistics quickly and easily.</p>
<p>We believe <strong>GlobalStats</strong> will be unique in the wireless &amp; mobile research industry and will change how market research is delivered in the future.</p>
<h2>When will you use GlobalStats?</h2>
<p>Our goal with GlobalStats is to build an iPad that is rich with data and information on the wireless and mobile communications industry. We want GlobalStats to be useful to a wide range of people in the industry, not just research professionals. So we expect many people to find value in the app, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sales: </strong>Imagine you are about to meet with an important client or prospect and need to know the number of smartphones in Latin America. Or how many LTE subscribers are in Japan.  A few clicks on GlobalStats will give the answers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Relations: </strong>Need some stats for a press release? Or a client pitch? GlobalStats has the answers readily available.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing:</strong> Need to put together a product presentation? Or a company marketing deck?  GlobalStats provides access to charts and stats for marketing presentations, outreach plans, media campaigns and content marketing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Business Development:</strong> For those who want to understand the opportunity for specific markets, GlobalStats has a wealth of information.  From detailed market forecasts to end user views and opinions, GlobalStats provides important input to your data plan.</li>
<li>
<strong>Engineering:</strong> Need to know how many consumers use iPhones vs. Android smartphones? Or how much mobile data bandwidth is consumed in Brazil? Or the forecast for VoLTE?  GlobalStats can help.</li>
</ul><h2>Why are we using Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>Before we start development of the GlobalStats app, we decided we needed to answer two questions for ourselves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there is real demand for an app like this? We think it is a great idea that meets a need we've identified. But, not everyone in the wireless and mobile industry may agree.  So, put simply, we do not want to build an app that only a few people will use. We need to make sure there is an audience.</li>
<li>Are our price points for GlobalStats viable? Obviously, it will cost real dollars to build and maintain the app throughout 2013. So, we need investment to get the project (and product) off the ground. We have also built-in several perks that include access to the Globalstats app for up to 12 months.</li>
</ol><p>To summarize, crowdfunding seemed like a good approach to take with the GlobalStats project. Early supporters will get not only access to a great app at a great price, but also the feel-good factor of knowing they started something new!</p>
<h2>GlobalStats Overview</h2>
<p>The image below is a mock up of the main page of the new GlobalStats app.  A few things to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main sections of the app are listed along the bottom</li>
<li>The 'Latest research' section shows new data and stats that have been added</li>
<li>The map of the world will take you straight into the forecasts section</li>
<li>The 'Keyword search' on the top right provides a search on all the data in the site for quick and easy navigation</li>
</ul><p>The final layout/design may change when we get into development, but this is what we are aiming for. Simple, easy and fast access to the data you want!</p>

<h2>Other data</h2>
<p>GlobalStats includes several other areas that are also of value:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>News</strong> provides links to major wireless &amp; mobile industry news sites.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Opinion</strong> is iGR's newsletter; this link will provide access to the content plus the ability to sign up.</li>

</ul><h2>Updated research in 2013</h2>
<p>Obviously, a market research app is only as good as the data in it. GlobalStats is no different.  So to keep the app current and valuable, iGR will provide updates, new survey data and new forecasts throughout 2013. </p>
<p>We expect to provide updates weekly. Users will be notified that there is updated data in the app and, once they launch GlobalStats, they will have immediate access to the new information.</p>
<h2>Where we're at and what we are going to do</h2>
<p>Presently, we have built the demo and have developers scheduled to start work.  We expect to raise the funds we need in October and start development November 1st.  Delivery of the initial GlobalStats app will be in January 2013.</p>
<p>We will also load all of the data into the databases in November and December.  And of course, we will provide updated data and forecasts throughout 2013.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>

iGR has been providing market research and information to the wireless & mobile industry for the last 12 years. We need your help with a new project we call GlobalStats.
GlobalStats is an iPad app that addresses one of the most fundamental problems industry professionals face today: Getting to data and stats quickly and efficiently. For research providers such as iGR, the issue is typically one of distribution. We have a great deal of data, forecasts and statistics that are valuable to the industry, but we have no way to deliver the data to a mobile device.  GlobalStats addresses this problem.
Our project is simple: Build the GlobalStats iPad app and provide updates to the information for 12 months.  GlobalStats will provide a new way to access survey data, market forecasts and other statistics quickly and easily.
We believe GlobalStats will be unique in the wireless & mobile research industry and will change how market research is delivered in the future.
When will you use GlobalStats?
Our goal with GlobalStats is to build an iPad that is rich with data and information on the wireless and mobile communications industry. We want GlobalStats to be useful to a wide range of people in the industry, not just research professionals. So we expect many people to find value in the app, such as:


Sales: Imagine you are about to meet with an important client or prospect and need to know the number of smartphones in Latin America. Or how many LTE subscribers are in Japan.  A few clicks on GlobalStats will give the answers.

Public Relations: Need some stats for a press release? Or a client pitch? GlobalStats has the answers readily available.

Marketing: Need to put together a product presentation? Or a company marketing deck?  GlobalStats provides access to charts and stats for marketing presentations, outreach plans, media campaigns and content marketing.

Business Development: For those who want to understand the opportunity for specific markets, GlobalStats has a wealth of information.  From detailed market forecasts to end user views and opinions, GlobalStats provides important input to your data plan.

Engineering: Need to know how many consumers use iPhones vs. Android smartphones? Or how much mobile data bandwidth is consumed in Brazil? Or the forecast for VoLTE?  GlobalStats can help.
Why are we using Indiegogo?
Before we start development of the GlobalStats app, we decided we needed to answer two questions for ourselves:

Is there is real demand for an app like this? We think it is a great idea that meets a need we've identified. But, not everyone in the wireless and mobile industry may agree.  So, put simply, we do not want to build an app that only a few people will use. We need to make sure there is an audience.
Are our price points for GlobalStats viable? Obviously, it will cost real dollars to build and maintain the app throughout 2013. So, we need investment to get the project (and product) off the ground. We have also built-in several perks that include access to the Globalstats app for up to 12 months.
To summarize, crowdfunding seemed like a good approach to take with the GlobalStats project. Early supporters will get not only access to a great app at a great price, but also the feel-good factor of knowing they started something new!
GlobalStats Overview
The image below is a mock up of the main page of the new GlobalStats app.  A few things to notice:

The main sections of the app are listed along the bottom
The 'Latest research' section shows new data and stats that have been added
The map of the world will take you straight into the forecasts section
The 'Keyword search' on the top right provides a search on all the data in the site for quick and easy navigation
The final layout/design may change when we get into development, but this is what we are aiming for. Simple, easy and fast access to the data you want!

Survey Stats
'Survey Stats' gives you access to the large amount of survey data we have.  Today, we have no way to publish this outside of Excel or Powerpoint.  Using GlobalStats, we can provide easy, quick access to the large amount of data we have available.
The app presents the data available as a series of 'drill downs'.  The first level (below) shows the main subject areas on which we have data.  As we complete new surveys, we will add subject areas.

 
As an example, lets assume you have tapped on 'WiFi'.  The next level in the app will show you the data we have available on WiFi (below): consumer devices, movies watched, improvements, places, small-medium business use of WiFi, etc.
 
Again, as we collect new data, we will add to these choices.
 

 
Now, clicking on 'WiFi devices used in the Home' will bring up the actual survey data (below).  In this example, we are showing a bar chart with the WiFi devices consumers say they use at home.  Note that this data is from a May 2012 U.S. Consumer Survey of 1,024 respondents.
 
iGR conducts surveys throughout the year and in multiple countries around the world.  As well as consumers, we also survey small businesses and IT managers. The data from these surveys will be included as appropriate.
 
Note that NONE of the survey data from proprietary or custom research we conduct for clients will be included in GlobalStats.
 

Summaries
'Summaries' allows the GlobalStats user to see executive summaries for iGR's research studies and briefs.  Navigation is similar to Survey Stats. The top level shows the main subject areas (see below). To date in 2012, iGR has published multiple research reports in the following subject areas:

Small cells including femtocells, DAS and WiFi hotspots
WiFi Offload
Self optimizing Networks (SON)
LTE, HSPA, HSPA+, etc networks
NFC
Video and music consumption on mobile networks
Software Defined Networks
VoLTE
Mobile data pricing trends
As new research is published, the executive summary will be available through GlobalStats.  iGR clients who have access to the full reports will be able to do so through GlobalStats.

 
The slide below shows an example of navigation in 'Summaries' - clicking on 'Smartphones' then shows the report subjects that are available.  Clicking on 'Android' then shows all of the reports that include Android smartphone data.
 

 
In this example, the U.S. Smartphone Forecast, 2011 - 2016, is selected - the executive summary is then displayed (below).

<p>RasPoE is a Power over Ethernet (PoE) shield for Raspberry Pi B+ and Raspberry Pi 2. The shield allows you to use a single Ethernet cable to provide both data and power to your Raspberry Pi project. RasPoE is compliant with the  IEEE 802.3af standard, so you can use it with any standard PoE-capable switch or injector.  <br/></p><p>RasPoE is fully open hardware -- the design files are published under GPL3. The<br/>current design is available at <a href=""https://github.com/ojousima/RaspberryPi-PoE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://github.com/ojousima/RaspberryPi-PoE</a>. Design is done in KiCAD. We'll clear up the schematics and publish full parts list with distributors so you can even assemble your own boards if you want to! All this is still quite a lot of work, so please give us a few weeks to polish the design.<br/><br/>We'll work to merge the PCB footprints created for the board back to KiCAD<br/>upstream during the campaign, your backing allows us to expand the common<br/>Open framework for electronics design.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>What Can I Do With It?</h3>
<p>You can use RasPoE in all solutions where single-cable connectivity to your RasPi device would be A Good Thing. Do you want to get rid of wall warts? Get a standard Power over Ethernet enabled switch or an injector to provide power over your Ethernet cabling, and one RasPoE shield for each of your RasPi devices and voilá, no more ugly wall warts! </p>
<p>If providing separate power would be ugly or inconvenient, Power over Ethernet -- and RasPoE -- is your solution.</p>
<p>RasPoE is perfect for hanging RasPi based security cameras, WiFi hotspots or home automation gateways around your house.</p>
<p>Our board is very simple to use: Just plug it in, connect the cables and you're online!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432661548/xnuomotfpu6brw42oayq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3>Power over Ethernet is...</h3>
<p>The idea in PoE is to deliver both data and power using just one cable. Standard RJ45 cable has 8 data wires organized in 4 pairs. A 100MBit/s Ethernet signaling uses two of these pairs, some implementations of PoE use the remaining two pairs for delivering power. There are also implementations which carry the power with the data lines. Our board can receive power in either configuration, as required by the standard.</p>
<p>PoE is standardized (IEEE 802.3af and 802.3at) and allows for long distances (up to 100m). PoE is also widespread and affordable as there is an increasing number of PoE enabled switches in use. Standardized PoE is also safe as signaling allows the presence of a conformant device to be detected by the power source,  and allows the device and source to negotiate the amount of power required or available.</p>
<p>There are also non-standard implementations which connect the power to cable without the negation. This is dangerous, as Gigabit Ethernet uses all pairs in cable. If a non-standard PoE-equipment is used, connecting a powered cable to non-PoE equipment can cause damage to both devices.

</p><h3>RasPoE is...</h3>
<p>Our board is IEEE 802.3af compliant class 0 device. It can deliver up to 6½ watts of power to Raspberry Pi and attached devices at 5 volts. Safety was one of the driving concerns in our design, we have included protection against over voltage and electrical transients. You and your Raspberry Pi are safe with our device.</p>
<p>In addition to our board, you will need a PoE-enabled switch or a midspan injector. We'll test several injectors and switches during the campaign and let you know our recommendations.

<p>The production run of the boards has to be at least moderate to make the project economically feasible. Your funding allows us to buy the reels of components and pay for the assembly of the boards.</p>
<p>Our rewards are targeted to two different audiences: We offer single boards to makers who want to try their hand with home automation and Power over Ethernet. We're offering deals for distributors and companies who want to resell or adapt the boards for their own applications.</p>
<p>This is a fixed funding campaign, which means that if the funding is not reached we won't take any of your money. All the design files are available under GPL3, so you can still make your own boards and possibly tailor them to your needs.  

</p><p>You can find technical details of our board in our <a href=""http://ell-i.org/products/poe-for-raspi/datasheet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">product page</a>.

</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have done extensive planning and testing while developing the board.   <a href=""http://ell-i.org/2015/04/13/raspberry-pi-poe-shield-first-round-of-prototypes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://ell-i.org/2015/04/13/raspberry-pi-poe-shield-first-round-of-prototypes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our first prototype </a>was a model with some insulating tape required, <a href=""http://ell-i.org/2015/04/30/raspberry-pi-poe-prototypes-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">second prototype</a> revealed that we need to add some input protection. We are satisfied with our <a href=""http://ell-i.org/2015/05/23/new-raspberry-pi-poe-boards-on-oscilloscope/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current design</a>. The only risk remaining is whether we get enough orders to manufacture the boards in quantity.</p>
<p>The boards will be assembled in a professional assembly line and any manufacturing errors are covered by warranty.
</p><p>We have gone through a few rounds of prototypes and the design has been tested and fine tuned to be convenient and reliable for everyday usage. In fact, we're streaming music to our desks with the prototype as we're typing this page.

</p><h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>The boards will be shipped directly to you from our manufacturer. We will cover at least the expense of normal shipping, and we will provide our EU customers with a receipt that shows the VAT for the items has already been paid in case customs asks for it. We cannot guarantee anything about what your local customs office might or might not decide to do, but if you have any trouble with customs clearance send us a message and we'll provide you with any paperwork we can.<br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like the idea, please spread the word. Ask your network infrastructure manager if the routers support PoE technology and suggest to have at least some PoE-capable spots installed. </p>
<p>Tell us about your projects and even product ideas, we're always interested in co-operation proposals for creating new connected devices. 

</p><h3>About Us</h3>
<p>ELL-i Co-operative is a young non-profit start-up. We are focusing on open source hardware and software designs for Internet of Things with emphasis on connectivity between the devices and cloud services. You can find more information about us at our<a href=""http://ell-i.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> website</a><a href=""http://ell-i.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>.</p>
<p>ELL-i has a proven track record of building PoE devices and applications. Our first design back in 2013 ""ELL-iduino"" was a standalone Power over Ethernet microcontroller platform. In 2014 we made a PoELL-i Nucleo, which is a Power over Ethernet shield for ST Nucleo boards. </p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>We would like to thank the community and awesome support we have had ever since the beginning. Especially <a href=""http://vaasa.hacklab.fi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vaasa's Hackerspace's</a> contribution to us was extremely important, as they found out about the transient vulnerability in Ethernet PHY of Raspberry Pi. Open developing of the boards with the community let us find a critical design flaw, which is now fixed before our release. Even if our campaign is not successful, the knowledge we gained during this spring is now out in the open where everyone can benefit from it.</p>
<p> There has been a lot of interest in building derivative works based on our board. As we're committed to values of Open Source, we're always happy to see our designs grow into something else. Please contact us with your ideas and suggestions, even if it's just to let us know that you're making something cool. This way we can focus at something else at ELL-i and avoid duplicating work.</p></div>","Short Summary

Get a standard Power over Ethernet enabled switch or an injector to provide power over your Ethernet cabling, and one RasPoE shield for each of your RasPi devices and voilá, no more ugly wall warts! 
If providing separate power would be ugly or inconvenient, Power over Ethernet -- and RasPoE -- is your solution.
RasPoE is perfect for hanging RasPi based security cameras, WiFi hotspots or home automation gateways around your house.
Our board is very simple to use: Just plug it in, connect the cables and you're online!
Power over Ethernet is...
The idea in PoE is to deliver both data and power using just one cable. Standard RJ45 cable has 8 data wires organized in 4 pairs. A 100MBit/s Ethernet signaling uses two of these pairs, some implementations of PoE use the remaining two pairs for delivering power. There are also implementations which carry the power with the data lines. Our board can receive power in either configuration, as required by the standard.
PoE is standardized (IEEE 802.3af and 802.3at) and allows for long distances (up to 100m). PoE is also widespread and affordable as there is an increasing number of PoE enabled switches in use. Standardized PoE is also safe as signaling allows the presence of a conformant device to be detected by the power source,  and allows the device and source to negotiate the amount of power required or available.
There are also non-standard implementations which connect the power to cable without the negation. This is dangerous, as Gigabit Ethernet uses all pairs in cable. If a non-standard PoE-equipment is used, connecting a powered cable to non-PoE equipment can cause damage to both devices.

RasPoE is...
Our board is IEEE 802.3af compliant class 0 device. It can deliver up to 6½ watts of power to Raspberry Pi and attached devices at 5 volts. Safety was one of the driving concerns in our design, we have included protection against over voltage and electrical transients. You and your Raspberry Pi are safe with our device.
In addition to our board, you will need a PoE-enabled switch or a midspan injector. We'll test several injectors and switches during the campaign and let you know our recommendations.

What We Need & What You Get
The production run of the boards has to be at least moderate to make the project economically feasible. Your funding allows us to buy the reels of components and pay for the assembly of the boards.
Our rewards are targeted to two different audiences: We offer single boards to makers who want to try their hand with home automation and Power over Ethernet. We're offering deals for distributors and companies who want to resell or adapt the boards for their own applications.
This is a fixed funding campaign, which means that if the funding is not reached we won't take any of your money. All the design files are available under GPL3, so you can still make your own boards and possibly tailor them to your needs.  

You can find technical details of our board in our product page.

Risks & Challenges
We have done extensive planning and testing while developing the board.   Our first prototype was a model with some insulating tape required, second prototype revealed that we need to add some input protection. We are satisfied with our current design. The only risk remaining is whether we get enough orders to manufacture the boards in quantity.
The boards will be assembled in a professional assembly line and any manufacturing errors are covered by warranty.
We have gone through a few rounds of prototypes and the design has been tested and fine tuned to be convenient and reliable for everyday usage. In fact, we're streaming music to our desks with the prototype as we're typing this page.

Shipping
The boards will be shipped directly to you from our manufacturer. We will cover at least the expense of normal shipping, and we will provide our EU customers with a receipt that shows the VAT for the items has already been paid in case customs asks for it. We cannot guarantee anything about what your local customs office might or might not decide to do, but if you have any trouble with customs clearance send us a message and we'll provide you with any paperwork we can.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you like the idea, please spread the word. Ask your network infrastructure manager if the routers support PoE technology and suggest to have at least some PoE-capable spots installed. 
Tell us about your projects and even product ideas, we're always interested in co-operation proposals for creating new connected devices. 

About Us
ELL-i Co-operative is a young non-profit start-up. We are focusing on open source hardware and software designs for Internet of Things with emphasis on connectivity between the devices and cloud services. You can find more information about us at our website.
ELL-i has a proven track record of building PoE devices and applications. Our first design back in 2013 ""ELL-iduino"" was a standalone Power over Ethernet microcontroller platform. In 2014 we made a PoELL-i Nucleo, which is a Power over Ethernet shield for ST Nucleo boards. 
Thanks
We would like to thank the community and awesome support we have had ever since the beginning. Especially Vaasa's Hackerspace's contribution to us was extremely important, as they found out about the transient vulnerability in Ethernet PHY of Raspberry Pi. Open developing of the boards with the community let us find a critical design flaw, which is now fixed before our release. Even if our campaign is not successful, the knowledge we gained during this spring is now out in the open where everyone can benefit from it.
 There has been a lot of interest in building derivative works based on our board. As we're committed to values of Open Source, we're always happy to see our designs grow into something else. Please contact us with your ideas and suggestions, even if it's just to let us know that you're making something cool. This way we can focus at something else at ELL-i and avoid duplicating work.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is USBand?</span></strong></p>
<p>The USBand is the first USB Flash Drive hidden in a silicone bracelet designed to fit your wrist comfortably and with style! The USBand allows you to travel anywhere with your files easily available right on your wrist.  You will never again fumble looking for your USB flash drive in your bag, pockets, or leaving it behind somewhere.  The USBand is compatible with any USB port on your computer, speakers, car USB jacks, and many more.  You can tranfer your music, pictures, and files to your devices anywhere, anytime! </p>
<h3><strong>How We Came Up With Our Concept</strong></h3>
<p><span>As my business partner and I were sitting around for our daily coffee in the heart of Silicon Valley, we saw a women frustrated digging in her purse looking for something. Her laptop was out and as she was apparently looking for her USB flash drive to do some work. As her frustration grew, she was talking to herself wishing USB Flash drives are bigger and not so hard to find. At the same time, we saw a kid wearing a silicone band (representing his school logo), and my partner said to me, ""I just thought of something"" As I have heard that line so many times, and at this point it sounded like a broken record player, he suggested to combine the USB flash with a silicone bracelet so that it is easily accessible. At that time, I thought of it as nothing, and weeks later... we found ourselves researching this type of product. As months has gone by and a product like this was ""All Talk"" we decided to contact some of our sources to see if this is possible to combine. Reality came to us knowing that product will be useful out there in the world. We decided to fully pursue this with test phases and a budget design team (okay, I shall say we designed it ourselves), Today, we have the concept, the passion, but we are falling short on Tooling and Initial Production Run. That is why we are here on Indiegogo to help us get to the next level.</span></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Never Lose A Flash Drive Again! </span></strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://doozy-inc.com/uploads/3/2/2/7/3227112/6491100.jpg?475"" src="""" style=""font-size: 10px;""/></p>
<div>
<p>Flash Drives are commonly used in public space.  Often people forget them on the desk, leave them plugged in, or even drop them.  With the USBand you will not have that problem!  Wearing your USBand is like never forgetting your watch! </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://doozy-inc.com/uploads/3/2/2/7/3227112/2122369.jpg?1366712316"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">How Does USBand Work?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your USBand can be used just like a conventional flash drive.  You just slide the USB Flash Drive out of the slot of the silicone bracelet and plug it into any USB port devices.  When you plug your USBand into the computer you will see the USB Flash drive pop-up or simply access the files on ""My Computer"".  Use your USBand to upload or download files and pretty much you are done!  You can access these files anywhere where USB access are available, from a computer or laptop to save your documents and files, vehicle audio systems to play music files, laptop for easy accessibility and portability, to a projector to show off your PowerPoint presentation or to share pictures and videos.  </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What Are The Benefits Of USBand?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Workplace-  </strong>Work can be busy and hectic at times. With the USBand, you simply put it on and will always constantly have it on you. Searching, sending and saving work documents to access them is no longer necessary with the USBand. Put the USBand on like putting on your watch or grabbing your keys will save you from forgetting any of your work documents for that big presentation!</p>
<p><strong>Schools- </strong>Your children's lives in school is full of homework, projects and extra curricular activities nowadays. Technology like laptops and USB Flash Drives are requirements for your child's education.  Students often forget or lose things because it's one more thing they have to remember. The USBand will help solve that problem. Putting on the USBand every morning like putting on their backpack will become an easy habit. Plus they can show off the amazing designs and colors to their friends and will have no more excuses not to turn in their homework! </p>
<p><strong>Daily Use- </strong>People are expressive in the bands and bracelets to represent what they support in a charity, believes in life, or simply for company spirit.  The USBand is similar in style and can be personalized!  Imagine having all your music files on your USBand to plug in your car or office without utilizing any other devices. You can save photo files at anytime or on the go share videos and pictures with your friends and family members, all conveniently available on your wrist!</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Memory</span></strong></p>
<p>The USBand has lots of memory!  We are currently producing the 8GB of memory USBand.  We will be working with larger memory space with our Indiegogo funds which will allow an affordable price point for this product.</p>
<h3>What is the USBand Made Of?</h3>
<p>The great thing about the silicone material on our USBand is that the durability is tough not like the typical cheap ""rubber like"" materials.  The silicone is also odorless and kid safe. *Due to our manufactures privacy, sorry we could not provide pictures of the machinary that is used to make the bracelet.</p>

<h3>Production/Manufacturing Plans</h3>
<p>There are three main parts to the USBand: SIlicon, PVC, Flash Memory and Design. Production for all three of these will come together in the final stage of shipping/assembly. Most importantly we want YOU to be a part of this process. We will be sending updates every step of the way.  On our website, we will be blogging, tracking, updating, and answering feedback/comments. We will also give you the opportunity for our most excited enthusiast to het their hands on pre-production units for review.  Your opinions and suggestions are always appreciated.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>The great thing about the silicone material on our USBand is that the durability is tough not like the typical ""rubber like"" materials.  The silicone is odorless and kid safe.  The USBand can withstand a little a bit of water, not waterproof due to the opening for the flash drive, however you may wear it while washing your hands.  We do not recommend swimming with or submerge the USBand in water.</p>

</div></div>","What is USBand?
The USBand is the first USB Flash Drive hidden in a silicone bracelet designed to fit your wrist comfortably and with style! The USBand allows you to travel anywhere with your files easily available right on your wrist.  You will never again fumble looking for your USB flash drive in your bag, pockets, or leaving it behind somewhere.  The USBand is compatible with any USB port on your computer, speakers, car USB jacks, and many more.  You can tranfer your music, pictures, and files to your devices anywhere, anytime! 
How We Came Up With Our Concept
As my business partner and I were sitting around for our daily coffee in the heart of Silicon Valley, we saw a women frustrated digging in her purse looking for something. Her laptop was out and as she was apparently looking for her USB flash drive to do some work. As her frustration grew, she was talking to herself wishing USB Flash drives are bigger and not so hard to find. At the same time, we saw a kid wearing a silicone band (representing his school logo), and my partner said to me, ""I just thought of something"" As I have heard that line so many times, and at this point it sounded like a broken record player, he suggested to combine the USB flash with a silicone bracelet so that it is easily accessible. At that time, I thought of it as nothing, and weeks later... we found ourselves researching this type of product. As months has gone by and a product like this was ""All Talk"" we decided to contact some of our sources to see if this is possible to combine. Reality came to us knowing that product will be useful out there in the world. We decided to fully pursue this with test phases and a budget design team (okay, I shall say we designed it ourselves), Today, we have the concept, the passion, but we are falling short on Tooling and Initial Production Run. That is why we are here on Indiegogo to help us get to the next level.
Never Lose A Flash Drive Again! 


Flash Drives are commonly used in public space.  Often people forget them on the desk, leave them plugged in, or even drop them.  With the USBand you will not have that problem!  Wearing your USBand is like never forgetting your watch! 

How Does USBand Work?


Your USBand can be used just like a conventional flash drive.  You just slide the USB Flash Drive out of the slot of the silicone bracelet and plug it into any USB port devices.  When you plug your USBand into the computer you will see the USB Flash drive pop-up or simply access the files on ""My Computer"".  Use your USBand to upload or download files and pretty much you are done!  You can access these files anywhere where USB access are available, from a computer or laptop to save your documents and files, vehicle audio systems to play music files, laptop for easy accessibility and portability, to a projector to show off your PowerPoint presentation or to share pictures and videos.  
What Are The Benefits Of USBand?
Workplace-  Work can be busy and hectic at times. With the USBand, you simply put it on and will always constantly have it on you. Searching, sending and saving work documents to access them is no longer necessary with the USBand. Put the USBand on like putting on your watch or grabbing your keys will save you from forgetting any of your work documents for that big presentation!
Schools- Your children's lives in school is full of homework, projects and extra curricular activities nowadays. Technology like laptops and USB Flash Drives are requirements for your child's education.  Students often forget or lose things because it's one more thing they have to remember. The USBand will help solve that problem. Putting on the USBand every morning like putting on their backpack will become an easy habit. Plus they can show off the amazing designs and colors to their friends and will have no more excuses not to turn in their homework! 
Daily Use- People are expressive in the bands and bracelets to represent what they support in a charity, believes in life, or simply for company spirit.  The USBand is similar in style and can be personalized!  Imagine having all your music files on your USBand to plug in your car or office without utilizing any other devices. You can save photo files at anytime or on the go share videos and pictures with your friends and family members, all conveniently available on your wrist!
Memory
The USBand has lots of memory!  We are currently producing the 8GB of memory USBand.  We will be working with larger memory space with our Indiegogo funds which will allow an affordable price point for this product.
What is the USBand Made Of?
The great thing about the silicone material on our USBand is that the durability is tough not like the typical cheap ""rubber like"" materials.  The silicone is also odorless and kid safe. *Due to our manufactures privacy, sorry we could not provide pictures of the machinary that is used to make the bracelet.

<h3>Add Some Color to Your World!</h3>
<p>Transform your home with the Viváve accent lighting system.  Thin and flat, the lights can hide in unexpected places and make a room come alive.  <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vivave.com/funding/BedWithBlue300w.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>The difference a little color can make is stunning.  A simple splash of light can whisk you away to a peaceful oasis, or help get you pumped for the day if that's what you need. Spice up your kitchen when entertaining or relax in tranquil coziness in your bedroom.</p>
<p>The Viváve system is networked.  You control the lighting with your iPhone or web browser!</p>
<p>Adjust all your lights at once, or each light individually, you're in control.</p>
<p>And really, the whole point of having them networked is to be able to create smooth flowing color animations.  Fluid and peaceful flow for a calming effect, or dancing to the beat and harmony of your music, your room comes alive in color.</p>
<p>You'll never see a blank wall the same way again.</p>
<p>Viváve is bringing features found in gear that costs upwards of $2000 for a starting price of just $120 for a controller and one light.  Here comes affordable home automation!</p>
<p>Viváve was created by the artist/engineer Vim Venture.  Having many LED lighting projects under his belt, he originally made this system for his own home in his spare time.  The more his prototypes developed, the more excited he got about bringing this product to market.  And here it is in the home stretch!</p>
<p>Your Perk will put you in the cutting edge of home automation, starting with this beautiful accent lighting.  But beyond that, your contribution will create and sustain careers in the U.S.A.  With your help, the Viváve system can take this step in bringing innovative lighting designs to reality.  So many possibilities!</p>

<p>Publicly available statistics about the extent of
cybercrime make clear that conventional computers and smartphones fail to
prevent security breaches. The Quasar IV prevents identity theft and data leaks
by using Quatrix, a proprietary encryption logic based on advanced trusted-authentication
technology.</p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 125%; letter-spacing: 0.95px; line-height: 1.6em;"">How does Quatrix work?</b><br/></p>
<p><b>On a standard smartphone</b>, when you text, email, call and store files, each service must verify who you are, so they provide you with a public key that is stored online. Every time you use each service, this public key confirms your identity.</p>
<p><b>Because public keys have to be stored and authenticated online by a third party server, your identity could be vulnerable to intrusion attacks.</b></p>
<p>No matter how complicated your passwords are, intruders
can still impersonate your digital identity if they infiltrate and take control of the authentication server. Your lost digital identity may be used for cyber-crime. Until now, we’ve been relying on third-party agencies to authenticate and protect our most valuable information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/77076/files/20130916071456-0828_QUA_KS_page_CS5_2-01.png?1379340896"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>On the Quasar IV</b>,
when you text, email, call and store files within Quatrix, you and your
contacts are authenticated via a public seed matrix located locally in the
Quasar IV’s Quatrix hardware chip. This occurs offline, on each phone. The seed public matrix is simply a mediator that helps Quatrix devices verify each other’s identities through computation rather than exchange.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/73902/files/20130914101654-db5223b1d25cca8f606f95320c2e2407_large.jpg?1379179014"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Verification happens on your device, not a public server</b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span>For Techies</b></p>
<p>By using state-of-the-art cryptography, we have
developed a methodology to create up to 10^77 public and private key pairs from 16^16^4 three-dimensional matrices. By storing the possible encrypted
combinations on the device, it becomes extremely difficult to forge your
digital identity. On top of this, access to the Quasar IV’s secure apps
requires both an 8+ digit PIN and a Two-Man Rule login.</p>
<p>Essentially, QSAlpha has engineered a way to safely
authenticate users in the digital world without incurring massive
infrastructure costs. We’ve created a mathematically engineered matrix that
contains all possible combinations of identity keys and then issued it to each individual user encoded in hardware. Truly safe identity verification must mimic the methods of real world, through offline communication security, and<b> Quatrix does exactly that.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Quatrix Trusted-Authentication Flow<br/></span></b></p>

<p>The key generation and distribution structure is the
base of the Quatrix System. The private and public keys are generated separately: the private key is generated by the Key Management Center

<p>Signature verification and data encryption are performed
using the Quatrix Key System. Since the public key is generated on the user
side, the two operations are performed in peer-to-peer manner, and no online
third-party agency is necessary. </p>

</p>
<p>Pair generation of <i>Key<sub>cs</sub> and Key<sub>CP</sub></i>  in Quatrix is based on two principles:</p>
<p>a. In seed-based key generation,
one <i>Key<sub>cs</sub></i> is related to <i>only one Key<sub>CP</sub> ,</i> and vice versa.</p>
<p>b. The summation
of two key-pairs is also a key pair.</p>
<p>So we can generate a secret seed <b><i>M<sub>s</sub></i></b> , which is a <i>f *</i> <i>h </i>matrix whose elements <i>s<sub>ij </sub></i>are
random integers. The elements<i> p<sub>ij</sub></i>of the public seed <b><i>M<sub>p</sub></i></b> can be derived from <b><i>M<sub>s</sub></i></b>
using Eq.(3). Note <i>s<sub>ij</sub></i>is a number , while<i> p<sub>ij </sub></i>is a point (pair of numbers) .</p>
<p>An ID-based private key <i>Key<sub>cs</sub></i> is the combination of
selected elements in <b><i>M<sub>s</sub></i></b>. Similarly, <i>Key<sub>cp</sub> i</i>s the combination of
the corresponding elements in <b><i>M<sub>p.</sub></i></b></p>

<p>In
signature verification procedure, a customer (Bob) executes signature
verification to authenticate the person (Alice) on the other side. The procedure
uses the private and public keys of the person (Alice) to be authenticated. The
general procedure is demonstrated in Fig.4. </p>
<p>Alice
sends Bob the signature (Alice’s ID encrypted using Alice’s private key), Bob generates
Alice’s public key and decrypts the received signatures. The signature is certificated
if the decrypted data matches Alice’s ID. In this procedure, Bob generates Alice’s
public key on his own side, no third-party involved.</p>
<p>The

<h2>
<span><br/></span>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>Turning a prototype into a device suitable for mass
production presents a series of challenges for any company. It’s important that
the design is scalable both financially and for production; components must be
able to be sourced in sufficient quantities for mass production; the final
product must have the high level of reliability associated with a mass produced
device; and critically, reliable component and assembly partners need to be
sourced.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have already overcome the riskiest areas
of this project. Along with a working prototype, the Quasar IV’s overall
hardware design has been validated by the manufacturer and is well suited for
mass production.</p>
<p>We can also confirm that we have secured a relationship
with a well-known OEM phone manufacturer to bring the product to the market. We
have also fully validated every single component in the Quasar IV and teamed up
with an experienced component procurement company to ensure timely delivery to
the manufacturer for final assembly. This means we can deliver to the high
level of specification and design outlined in this project while meeting our
timeline.</p>
<p>If our Indiegogo campaign is successful, we will use the
funds to produce our final prototypes, complete the tooling and certification, begin
mass production and deliver the final Quasar IV to your doorstep.</p>
<p>Along with the handset hardware, your money will also
fund additional application development for the QuaWorks ecosystem. We will
keep you updated on our progress throughout the process, with the overall aim
of shipping the first production units in April 2014.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><br/></span></p>

Cipherphone Designed To Protect Your Digital Identity.
The making of the Quasar IV is a project that is designed to reinstate
personal liberty to the internet.  Based
on the world's most advanced security concepts and a trusted-authentication
technology, it allows users to self-manage their digital interactions and
create a trusted social circle.

The Quasar IV will be production ready in March 2014 and
available to the general public in June 2014. Indiegogo backers will receive
the Quasar IV in April 2014. The Quasar IV offers the following key features:
• Advanced trusted-authentication technology called Quatrix
• Unique digital signature and key computation methodology to protect your
digital identity
• Quad-core 2.3GHz CPU,
3GB RAM, 64/128GB encrypted local storage and 128GB encrypted cloud storage
• Dual rear cameras for advanced
augmented reality applications
• Android OS with an
encryption layer
• Open SDK for the
developer community
• Dual LTE with support
for 3G and GSM networks



The Quasar IV is a “cipherphone” that safeguards the
user’s digital identity with self-authenticated verification. All data
exchanges between Quasar IVs are protected by trusted-authentication technology.
The Quasar IV is your gateway to a community of secure messages, emails,
calls, cloud storage and mobile applications:
• Protect Your Digital Identity: Quasar
IV uses a revolutionary self-authenticated, asymmetric encryption system called
Quatrix that automatically verifies the identity of other Quasar IV users
before information is sent. Your private identity key is encrypted in a
hardware chip, making unauthorized access to data extremely difficult.
• Secure Operating System: QuaOS, Quasar IV’s operating system, is a fusion
of Android, Linux and the Quatrix encryption software. The Quasar IV provides unprecedented
security for Android users.
• Open Ecosystem for Developers: QSAlpha provides a software development kit (SDK) that
allows software developers to build secure applications.
• Secure Community: Quasar
IV users receive the most complete protection when communicating with other
Quasar IV users.

Over the last five years, more than 27 million Americans
have fallen prey to identity theft and 73 percent have suffered from
cybercrime. Americans lose over $20 billion to identity theft each year. In
2012 alone, the Identity Theft Resource Center documented 447 major security
breaches in the US that left 17 million personal records exposed to criminal
activity.
Quasar IV has been designed for:
• Individuals who use
their mobile devices to handle e-commerce transactions, day-to-day banking,
storage of sensitive personal information or just casual correspondence.
• Individuals who value
privacy and peace of mind and would like to ensure that their private
correspondence is kept private.
• Individuals who want
to ensure that eavesdroppers and stalkers cannot track their every move in the
digital domain.
• Businesses that value
data security and want to ensure that communications between executives,
employees, customers and others cannot be read or listened to by third parties.

Quasar IV offers protection against external threats to enterprise and personal users of digital networks.












Publicly available statistics about the extent of
cybercrime make clear that conventional computers and smartphones fail to
prevent security breaches. The Quasar IV prevents identity theft and data leaks
by using Quatrix, a proprietary encryption logic based on advanced trusted-authentication
technology.
How does Quatrix work?
On a standard smartphone, when you text, email, call and store files, each service must verify who you are, so they provide you with a public key that is stored online. Every time you use each service, this public key confirms your identity.
Because public keys have to be stored and authenticated online by a third party server, your identity could be vulnerable to intrusion attacks.
No matter how complicated your passwords are, intruders
can still impersonate your digital identity if they infiltrate and take control of the authentication server. Your lost digital identity may be used for cyber-crime. Until now, we’ve been relying on third-party agencies to authenticate and protect our most valuable information.



On the Quasar IV,
when you text, email, call and store files within Quatrix, you and your
contacts are authenticated via a public seed matrix located locally in the
Quasar IV’s Quatrix hardware chip. This occurs offline, on each phone. The seed public matrix is simply a mediator that helps Quatrix devices verify each other’s identities through computation rather than exchange.

Verification happens on your device, not a public server
For Techies
By using state-of-the-art cryptography, we have
developed a methodology to create up to 10^77 public and private key pairs from 16^16^4 three-dimensional matrices. By storing the possible encrypted
combinations on the device, it becomes extremely difficult to forge your
digital identity. On top of this, access to the Quasar IV’s secure apps
requires both an 8+ digit PIN and a Two-Man Rule login.
Essentially, QSAlpha has engineered a way to safely
authenticate users in the digital world without incurring massive
infrastructure costs. We’ve created a mathematically engineered matrix that
contains all possible combinations of identity keys and then issued it to each individual user encoded in hardware. Truly safe identity verification must mimic the methods of real world, through offline communication security, and Quatrix does exactly that.Quatrix Trusted-Authentication Flow

In April 2011, The White House issued the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace.The goal was to encourage the
development of security infrastructure that would allow people to validate
their identities securely and efficiently.

The Quatrix solution goes beyond the The White House vision and also
addresses the requirements of the “Future Network.”
“Future
Network,” a program of the ITU
(International Telecommunication Union)’s SG13 (Study Group 13) on standards
for next generation networks (NGN), guided the security principles behind the Quasar IV’s self-authenticated and encryption technology. 
“Future Network” endorses trusted identity authentication security, the basis of Quatrix.
For Cryptographers
The Quatrix system is based on asymmetric encryption, which includes three function modules: Key Generation, Authentication (Signature Verification) and Data Encryption.

Fig.1 Quatrix System
The key generation and distribution structure is the
base of the Quatrix System. The private and public keys are generated separately: the private key is generated by the Key Management Center
(KMC), while the public key is generated by the user.  
Signature verification and data encryption are performed
using the Quatrix Key System. Since the public key is generated on the user
side, the two operations are performed in peer-to-peer manner, and no online
third-party agency is necessary. 
1. ID Based Key Pair Generation And Distribution

Fig.2
Key Pair Generation
The key
pairs in Quatrix are generated via combined matrices of public and secret seed matrices Mp and Ms (also called the ‘the key calculation base’). 
The Key Management Center (KMC) is the only owner
of Ms. The
private key is generated by KMC from the user’s ID. 

(1) The public key is generated by any user using
known ID.

(2) Mpand the key generation mapping gp(.) are distributed to the
user after encryption. Note that Seeds designs should consider applications in multiple domains (city, state, country, etc.).
The relationships between public and private keys are explained in Section 1.1. The
generation function is shown in Fig.3, and explained in Section 1.2.
1.1 Relationship of Private and Public Keys
The key generation is based on
elliptic curve cryptography (ECC P-192).
The relation between private key and the public key is



Pair generation of Keycs and KeyCP  in Quatrix is based on two principles:
a. In seed-based key generation,
one Keycs is related to only one KeyCP , and vice versa.
b. The summation
of two key-pairs is also a key pair.
So we can generate a secret seed Ms , which is a f * h matrix whose elements sij are
random integers. The elements pijof the public seed Mp can be derived from Ms
using Eq.(3). Note sijis a number , while pij is a point (pair of numbers) .
An ID-based private key Keycs is the combination of
selected elements in Ms. Similarly, Keycp is the combination of
the corresponding elements in Mp.
1.2  from ID to Keycs

Fig.3 Key Generation Procedure
The procedure
include several steps
a) 
Hash (using SHA-2 algorithm) to generate a fixed length
variable for matrix coordination
b) 
Row index reshuffling
c) 
Column index reshuffling
Step b) and c) produce an index
table to select element in seeds.
d)  Keycsis the combination of selected elements of Ms using index table Indr..

(4) For public key, the index table Indris generated by other
users with the mapping same function.  
1.3 Contents distributed
with Private Key : hardware protected (encrypted) IC chip
a) Seeds of public key
b) Key generation functions in
1.2
c) Private key
d) Multiple groups of a,b&c
may be included for different domains.
e) Functions for signature and authentication
All items above are encrypted in
IC chip. The user can use the functions on the chip, but cannot
access the original codes & parameters.
2. Signature Verification
(Bob to verify Alice’s signature)

Fig.4 Signature
Verification
In
signature verification procedure, a customer (Bob) executes signature
verification to authenticate the person (Alice) on the other side. The procedure
uses the private and public keys of the person (Alice) to be authenticated. The
general procedure is demonstrated in Fig.4. 
Alice
sends Bob the signature (Alice’s ID encrypted using Alice’s private key), Bob generates
Alice’s public key and decrypts the received signatures. The signature is certificated
if the decrypted data matches Alice’s ID. In this procedure, Bob generates Alice’s
public key on his own side, no third-party involved.
The
procedure can be mathematically described as follows:
Alice
(generate signature)  
A signature includes two parts:
signature code and check code

where SAlice is Alice’s signature code, CAlice
 is check code
Bob (verification) Two steps include: 
1) generate
public key of Alice 

2) verification using verification function Sv
and Alice’s public key:

Alice’s
signature is verified if

3. Password/Data
Exchange (from Alice to Bob)



Fig.5 Data Encryption
In this procedure,
Alice encrypted (AES256 - CBC mode encrypted) her data using a system generated random
number(password, PW). PW is also enveloped (ECC P-192 encrypted) using Bob’s public
key. Bob recovers the PW using his private key first and then decrypts the data
using the PW.
The mathematical procedure
is described as following:
Alice: Encrypt the original data data0 using encryption function e(.) with Bob’s public key, and generate encrypted password of datae

Bob:
1) 
Recover the password using password decryption function dp(.)
with Bob’s private key

2)  Decrypt datae
using data decryption function with password PW

datad is decoded version of datao.
From The Security Expert
""A lot of the nightmares we face in the information security and privacy industry include aspects like cryptographic key management, trusted identity, and an overall fragility in the hardware devices that we use. QSAlpha's Quatrix system and the Quasar IV cipherphone's strategy of securing both the software and hardware is the approach that's needed for a trusted computing environment.""
- Justin Troutman
An Independent Security And Privacy Researcher




It is not safe to entrust one company, corporation or
entity with the protection of your personal data. QuaOS is a fusion of Android,
Linux and the Quatrix trusted-authentication technology to create the world’s
first mobile OS that utilizes self-authenticated logic to safeguard your
communication and data-sharing. Storing the private seed matrix offline and
providing the user with the hardware encoded key pairings gives the user
control over security, rather than any one corporation or entity.
Using Quasar IV with QuaOS means that you are in control of your own data and you are able to safeguard your own digital identity.





QSAlpha will actively promote innovation among
developers. Quasar IV offers developers access to the core source code to
encourage the creation of a completely open yet secure application ecosystem.
QuaOS offers developers the opportunity to create a vast
range of data-encrypted applications which, in time, will be able to leverage a
trusted community of Quasar IV owners.








We took our design inspiration from one of the world’s
most recognized symbols of secrecy, supernatural ability and stealth: the art
of Ninjutsu. 

In the digital world, privacy and security have been
impossible to attain until now, which is why we found our inspiration in a
warrior who does the impossible. We created a device that allows users to send
data undetected across the rooftops and through the alleyways of cyberspace.
The Quasar IV not only reflects the covertness of a ninja, but also the
extraordinary grace, flexibility and subtlety of this iconic figure.

Simple but effective, subtle yet powerful, functional
but graceful, the Quasar IV gives the user an indelible sense of being on a
mission. It is the shadow of people who move about with a purpose. 

The way of Ninjutsu inspired the way of the ultimate
digital defense system.

The Quasar IV is the world’s first cipherphone tailored
to secure privacy.  The device has been named Quasar IV because the IV
stands for Identity Vessel, and because the fourth amendment of the US
constitution guarantees the right to privacy.



The Quasar IV combines a suite of encrypted applications
and the ability to safeguard personal information with features we commonly
associate with smartphones: fast processors, onboard memory, sensors, front and
rear facing cameras and 4G connectivity.
Most importantly, it opens up a new world to the
developer community by providing a system that protects applications, content
and intellectual property from piracy. 
We’ve spent the last three years developing and
integrating the security and smartphone technologies to the point where we now
have the design finalized, along with the latest working prototypes. The scope
of design work that has been completed includes the following:
• PCBA+LCM+OGS Touch
Panel
• Internal
Poly-Carbonate Case Molding and Fitting
• Antenna Placement and
Electromagnetic Interference Test
• External Glass Molding
• QuaOS based on Android
4.3
• QuaWorks – Framework
of Secure Applications by Third Party Developers
• 3D Home with Augmented
Reality



We now look to you to get the Quasar IV into the final
phase of testing and production. We are crowdsourcing USD $3,200,000 dollars to
take us from our current stage to manufacturing the first 10,000 units. If we
exceed our target, we will be able to increase the first manufacturing run.
The Quasar IV 64GB edition will be retailed for $785 but
is available to backers for only $595 and the Quasar IV 128GB edition will be
retailed for $855 but is available to backers for only $665. As soon as the
campaign starts, we are offering the first 950 units of Quasar IV 64GB for just
$495. Of course, we also offer a wide range of other rewards for different
pledge levels.

We hope you will support our aim of becoming the first
company to offer a solution to one of the digital era’s greatest problems.

Risks and challenges
Turning a prototype into a device suitable for mass
production presents a series of challenges for any company. It’s important that
the design is scalable both financially and for production; components must be
able to be sourced in sufficient quantities for mass production; the final
product must have the high level of reliability associated with a mass produced
device; and critically, reliable component and assembly partners need to be
sourced.
Thankfully, we have already overcome the riskiest areas
of this project. Along with a working prototype, the Quasar IV’s overall
hardware design has been validated by the manufacturer and is well suited for
mass production.
We can also confirm that we have secured a relationship
with a well-known OEM phone manufacturer to bring the product to the market. We
have also fully validated every single component in the Quasar IV and teamed up
with an experienced component procurement company to ensure timely delivery to
the manufacturer for final assembly. This means we can deliver to the high
level of specification and design outlined in this project while meeting our
timeline.
If our Indiegogo campaign is successful, we will use the
funds to produce our final prototypes, complete the tooling and certification, begin
mass production and deliver the final Quasar IV to your doorstep.
Along with the handset hardware, your money will also
fund additional application development for the QuaWorks ecosystem. We will
keep you updated on our progress throughout the process, with the overall aim
of shipping the first production units in April 2014.

After we get funding, we will seek to partner with Logitech and Sprint to manufacture and market the Dream Keyboard Case. 

Suppose Logitech and Sprint aren’t interested?


Then we will ask our contributors for suggestions on who else to pick to manufacture and market our technology. 

Doesn’t this mean risk to our contributors?


Yes.  If you do not believe we have breakthrough technology, then please do not become a contributor. 

What is the projected date of the 2,000 Dream Keyboard Case WORKING PROTOTYPE release?

We chose a release date of March 2013 that we knew we could easily meet.
We don’t want to disappoint anyone.

We will post the exact date as soon as we know. 

What happens if there are more than 2,000 contributors?

The first group of 2,000 contributors get to keep the WORKING PROTOTYPE as their PERK.

The second group of contributors get as their PERK a 25% discount on the Dream Keyboard Case when released. 

Do you have to be a Sprint iPhone 5 user to get PERKS?


No. 

Do you have to be a Sprint iPhone 5 user to BUY the Dream Keyboard Case after the 60 day Indiegogo campaign ends?


Yes. 

Why are we giving an exclusive to Sprint?


It is good business. 

How will the Dream Keyboard Case be sold outside the US market?

We will post an answer as soon as we know.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, my name is Andrei Socivoi I'm the inventor of the Snap On Case. I'm the type of person that always try to invent something and always open stuff to see who they work and try to improve them. And i make all my prototype by hand and at home from product that are all ready on the market, open them up and combining them...</p>
<h3>The <strong>Snap On Case</strong> beside being very simple idea it is very versatile phone case. The case can be used as a bracelet, vertical kickstand, horizontal kickstand, hands free stand, it can be attach to a lot of objects like ""street light pol"" for video and picture taking :) , ""street bench"" for video and picture taking, dash board in your car for GPS usage and many more that i didn't find out yet. Plus is a fun thing to play with.</h3>

<p>I have working prototypes, i field for a Patent and now i have a Patent Pending Status on the Snap On case. I have contacted a factory and i got a estimate price on the molds and on the cases.</p>
<p>I need $20.000 to make this project come to life, the money will be used to make the tow molds that i need to make the case, one of the molds will be for the silicon part of the case and the other molds will be for the plastic side of the case.</p>
<p>I got a estimate price for the molds, for the silicon molds a got a estimate of $3,000 and for the plastic mold a estimate of $5,000 but i round it up to $10,000 just to be in the save side.</p>
<p>I have to be able to make the minimum required order of 5.000 units.</p>
<p>Plus i will personally go to the factory and inspect the quality of the cases.</p>
<p>In order to make this happen i will need $20.000 which will cover all the cost.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<p>We collected hundreds of tips from our grandma's along the years and put them all in one website.</p>
<p>As per request of many visitors, we developed an iPhone app, raising money from our family and giving some of our own.</p>
<p>Now, many visitors suggested we will do the same for Android but we found it too hard to raise more money again :(</p>
<p>So we are here, asking you to help us in this great cause.</p>
<p>The app is totally free, just like the iPhone app (Home.Remedies) and we plan to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Our only incentive here is to asisst others and keep the world green, use only natural stuff and keep our health and youth.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The cost of developing the Android app (including design, a bit of marketing, QA and English writing here and there) is $30,000.</p>
<p>We already paid $5,000 as a first phase payment so it's already running and we will find a way to do this, one way or another.</p>
<p>We will really appreciate your help and will send you a link to install the app, a month before we will release it in ""Play"" (aka: Android Market).</p>
<p>This way, we can get your feedbacks and use you as testers as well :)</p>

<h4><b>What software development kit is needed in making apps for it?</b></h4>
<p>Only an android-based standard SDK will do in developing the apps. No special SDK is needed.

</div></div>","About this project
We are proud here to present Burstvision Smart Glass: a wearable technology as amazing as  Google Glass but of high quality-price ratio. Its compelling applications will make your life easier, full of fun, and shareable anywhere anytime. 
Among the impressive applications are: POV photography

POV Live streaming/Video surveillance/conferencing

Augmented Reality

Sports

Navigation 




Two types of Burstvision are available:  Burstvision Optical Glass and Burstvision Sunglass.The frames are light and durable. For Optical Glass, the non-prescription lenses can be replaced with prescription ones with the help of eye-care service providers.BurstVision Sunglass looks absolutely aesthestic at no cost of function.




Burstvision Glass can be controlled via Bluetooth from an Android phone. To make it happen, we have
developed an Android-based app, which is able to turn your mobile phone into an
input device with a keyboard and touch screen.  Unfortunately, the app for Apple IOS cannot be
developed due to  the unavailability of the protocol of OS.

Tech Specs




Roadmap to delivery









About us
We are based in the city of Shenzhen, known as China's Silicon Valley.  Our team, with over a decade of experience in electronics
industry, is familiar with manufacture
of eletronic products. We specialize in mobile phone and related products,  being among
those in Shenzhen who were the earliest to engage in research and development projects related to
Android-based mobile phone. As the glass and mobile phone
are quite similar devices in terms of software and hardware systems, our previous experience and resource has put us at an advantagous position in developing Burstvision Glass.




    Risks & Challenges

We have made sufficient effort to make our technology ripe, reliable and marketable, minimizing any potential risks involved in business promotion.
What we have done includes

sujecting the belta version to over three-month test.
improving the see-through projector technology a dozen of times until making its mass production possible. Now, the product can be pre-ordered and delivered in time.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to the new OwnFone!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We created the first OwnFone four years ago and the fully customisable, incredibly easy to use voice only mobile phone was an instant hit!</p>
<p>We managed to provide over 10,000 people with a really simple way to communicate with their loved ones - everyone loved it!</p>
<p>So we decided to think about how we could make it even better.  We wanted to keep the really flexible design, it had to be super easy to use just like before, but we wanted to add lots of background features that would significantly enhance its value to you and your family.</p>
<p>Features like GPS tracking to alert you when things aren't right, making it waterproof to protect against unexpected accidents and the ability to send information on the devices current status.  We also wanted to make it as future proof as currently possible, so we are adding 3G &amp; 4G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS!  We will have a built in service which prevents anyone other than pre-approved callers from the calling - no more cold callers!!!</p>
<p>All this extra functionality means that we can start to think about adding medical sensors in the future, home sensors where someone might not necessarily have home broadband and much much more!</p>
<p>To summarise, the OwnFone is the simplest, but most effective way of enabling anyone to communicate!</p>

<p>Outlook of MaxJuice<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>At the beginning, we conducted research on different battery packs in the market and discovered that most of them used a Li-ion cell which was thick and bulky. Worse still, it may be explosive after a long time of use at a high temperature. To build a thinner and safer battery pack, we decided to use a Li-Polymer cell, which is slim in size and non-explosive, in MaxJuice. Li-ion contains liquid-form solvents in the cell, which may cause danger. In contrast, all parts in the Li-polymer cell are in solid form. Prototypes of the Li-polymer battery pack were built in order to confirm the slim outlook.</p>
<p>Moreover, high-technology devices, including smartphones and tablets, are increasingly important in our daily lives, making it essential to keep them running all the time. Hence we aim at maximizing the battery capacity while balancing the size and weight of the battery pack.</p>
<p>And that's why you need MaxJuice, a slim yet ultra-high capacity battery pack.</p>

<p>BikeWatch is a new type bicycle security device. It is fixable under the bike seat and comes together with a cable lock and rear LED light. It’s built in waterproof, die-cast aluminum casing which gives extra protection against breaking off. The alarm is built not only to give a similar protection level as heavy chain locks do, but also to be easy to use and look good.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bikewatch.eu/campaign/2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>I and my friends are active cyclists who use bicycle every day to get from home to work or school. We have faced the same problem that many other cyclists have - light bicycle locks don’t guarantee the necessary safety, but large chains and U locks are too heavy and impractical to carry them with you every day. So it all ended for me not using locks at all, because I hate to carry heavy stuff in my backpack or keep the lock on my bike while riding.</p>
<p>After one of my bikes got stolen I started to search for alternatives and decided to stay with an alarm, because GPS solutions are expensive, easy to detect and I still need to carry a lock around. I ordered two different alarms, but upon receiving them I saw that they are ugly as hell and easy to break. I showed them to my friend who is an engineer and he said that he could make a better and safer alarm. And here you can see to what we have come after 5 months, 4 prototypes, long hours with designers and hard work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bikewatch.eu/campaign/3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Alarm</h2>
<p>The alarm function in BikeWatch device can be activated with iButton key. Just by pushing on iBotton reader with the key you can activate or deactivate the alarm. When the alarm is activated, it has three alert levels.</p>
<ol>
<li>At the first level, when the alert feels vibration, it beeps for once and goes in the waiting mode for 10 seconds. If there is no movement during these 10 seconds, it goes back in the vibration waiting mode.</li>
<li>If there is another movement during the 10 second waiting mode, it goes into the second alert level and gives out a 3 second long warning sound.</li>
<li>If there is the third movement during the waiting mode, it goes into the third alert mode and gives a 105 dB loud noise for as long as there is a movement and for 30 more seconds after the movement stops.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<h2>Cable lock</h2>
<p>When the cable is plugged in the alarm, it is automatically fixed by the electronic lock. It is possible to unplug it only when the alarm is not activated, by pushing on and holding iButton reader for 3 seconds just with your finger, and the alarm releases the cable and you can pull it out. When the alarm is activated you cannot pull out the cable and if it is cut, then the alarm goes off at the maximum level for 10 minutes and then stays at the 3rd alert level until it is deactivated.</p>
<p>There are two BikeWatch models with cable:</p>
<ul>
<li>with regular 3.3 feet (~1m) long and 0.2 inches (~5mm) wide cable;</li>
<li>with pull-in 6 feet (1.8 m) long and 0.06 inches (~1.5 mm) wide cable;</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bikewatch.eu/campaign/4b.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Rear LED light</h2>
<p>The device also has special design rear LED lights with optic fiber cables for better visibility. Lights can be turned on and switched between modes by shortly pushing on iButton reader with a finger.</p>
<p>Rear light has 4 modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>On</li>
<li>Blink</li>
<li>Fast blink</li>
<li>Off</li>
</ul><h2>Easy to install</h2>
<p>Installation is fast and easy. Insert 9v battery, fix the device under your seat (fits poles from 27.2mm till 31.6mm) with 4 screws (screwdriver included) and you are ready to go. Inside, in front of each screw there is a sensor, and if someone tries to take off the device while the alarm is active, it goes off at full volume.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQ<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do I need to bring a separate lock for the wheels?</strong></p>
<p>Depends on which BikeWatch device you are using. If you’re using only the „BikeWatch” alarm, then a separate lock would be recommended, but if you are using „BikeWatch with regular cable” then lock for front wheel is recommended. If you have BikeWatch with pull-in cable then you don’t need a separate lock because cable is 6 feet long and goes through both wheels.</p>
<p><strong>How tough is the cable? Can I snip it in 10 seconds or less?</strong></p>
<p>Cable can be cut with 3 feet long cutters but then the alarm will go off on maximum volume. Cables’ main function is not to allow thieve to just grab your bike while you run in a coffee shop or the mall.</p>
<p><strong>If the thief loosened the fixing bolts at top and bottom of the seat post he /she would be away with the rest.</strong></p>
<p>You can change fixing bolt for special screw which will be included in every BikeWatch box.</p>

FAQ
 
Do I need to bring a separate lock for the wheels?
Depends on which BikeWatch device you are using. If you’re using only the „BikeWatch” alarm, then a separate lock would be recommended, but if you are using „BikeWatch with regular cable” then lock for front wheel is recommended. If you have BikeWatch with pull-in cable then you don’t need a separate lock because cable is 6 feet long and goes through both wheels.
How tough is the cable? Can I snip it in 10 seconds or less?
Cable can be cut with 3 feet long cutters but then the alarm will go off on maximum volume. Cables’ main function is not to allow thieve to just grab your bike while you run in a coffee shop or the mall.
If the thief loosened the fixing bolts at top and bottom of the seat post he /she would be away with the rest.
You can change fixing bolt for special screw which will be included in every BikeWatch box.",11.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Videogames are my one true passion.  I knew from the moment I pressed my first button, to move my first character, that they would be a big part of my life.  I've been developing videogames as a hobby for many years (10+), and now finally feel I have the skills I need to take on this unique idea.</p>
<p>Right now I work making iPhone apps for a company, after completing my Bachelor of Information Technology.  When I get home after working full-time hours, I work on my videogames hoping that one day I can become an independant videogame developer.  Unfortunately I've found out that is hardly an ideal situation to be in.</p>
<p>Helping to fund Little Sim Peeps will give me the time and funds I need to make a great indie game and get it out there for people to enjoy.</p>

<h3>RPi Power Management problem</h3>
<p>RPi is usually powered by wall power supply adapter with +5VDC/1A output. Once power cord is plugged in, RPi starts booting and after while Linux desktop appears. Once 'System Shutdown' signal from Linux is sent shutdown routine will be activated and computer goes into stand-by mode after some time. Little power is still consumed in stand-by mode. Keyboard and/or mouse and monitor must be connected to the RPi to properly handle shutdown. To boot RPi again, power must be toggled OFF-ON manually. Therefore manual power switch must be installed or 'adapter plug/unplug' must be performed to boot system again. And this is small flaw in current RPi configuration....</p>
<h3><strong>Linux Boot/Shutdown sequence</strong></h3>
<p>Linux as almost all others operation systems does not like hot unplug of power supply. During this event loss of data or data corruption may occur. Thus is strongly recommended to perform proper Boot/Shutdown sequence via Linux 'System shutdown' command. This task is easy once monitor, keyboard and/or mouse are present. But, if RPi is used as embedded computer, this operation become very difficult.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong>RPi ATX Power Supply</strong></h3>
<p>Problem can be easily solved by using miniature RPi ATX power supply snap-in board. This simple piece of hardware is equipped with microcontroller, solid state overcurrent protected switch, LED indicators and push button. Original Mini USB power cable is connected to ATX-PS board instead of RPi itself. When push button is pressed for time period longer than 2s, RPi will power-up and boot into Linux environment. If user decides to shutdown RPi, push button needs to be pressed for 2s again. LED indicator starts toggle and 'System Shutdown' signal will be send to Linux. After RPi goes to Stand-by mode, power supply is disconnected and RPi board is completely power off. Frozen RPi can be restarted by pressing push button longer than 5s.<br/><br/>This 'One button' solution has obvious benefits once RPi is used as embedded computer or even if user is lazy to issue Shutdown command via mouse or keyboard. There is also additional 2 pin connector for external +5VDC power supply connection. Why? Because I am not big fan of USB-Micro connectors and want to have option for connection of another power source as well.</p>
<h3><strong>RPi ATX-PS installation</strong></h3>
<p>ATX-PS is snap-in and GO! board with 26way connector on one side and fixing hole 3.2mm on other side. One M3 bolt and 10mm spacer are holding board in place. There is possibility to add (solder) additional 26way connector with 1:1 connection in case user wants to preserve all extension GPIO pins for his own application. There is only one restriction in this setup. Pin GPIO4 – P7 is used for system shutdown and can not be used by other user applications. See pictures Gallery on top of this page.</p>

<p>We understand how frustrating it is to run out of
power when you are on the road or when you really need to use your cell phone.
After looking at the existing chargers in the market, we decided that there has
to be a better solution than those battery packs with misleading LED indicators. Not only that, but they also don't have enough power, or are too heavy, have a short battery life, out of style, or claim to hold more charge than they actually. </p><p>That is why we developed the Fig: the first
mobile power bank to offer a live organic LED display that accurately tells its
user how much charge is remaining, and what exactly is going on with their
device. Whether you need to charge your Iphone, Android phone, camera, tablet, handheld toy, or your USB flash light. The Fig displays the actual current that is drained
by your device to help you determine if your device is working and charging
properly or not. Now that is cool!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/362992/files/20140211065519-IWPB05_3.jpg?1392130519"" src="""" style=""width: 569px; height: 569px;""/></p><p></p>

<p>To keep it plain and simple, we want to become the

outsource our production to the leading manufacturing experts. This will ensure we bring

<p><b>Our difference:</b></p>
<p>We are so confident in the quality of our work that we offer a 1 year warranty on all of our products. Not too many power
bank manufacturers can do this because of the cheap batteries and low quality material that
they use.</p>
<p>With the growing concern of users improperly disposing their Li-Ion batteries, we have developed an initiative to help save the
environment. After pre-ordering your unit today, we will give you a $10 credit
when you return your battery pack one year from the date purchased. This allows us to dispose of
your used battery properly through recycling centers (to help save the
environment). This way you can make sure that you always have the latest mobile
charger, and be assured that you are not harming the <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">environment.</span></p><p><b>Solar Panel:</b><br/></p><p>If you purchase the Campers Package or one of the combo packages, they will come with this cool and powerful solar panel that can be used when you are camping or out in the wilderness.

<p><b>Our challenges:</b></p>
<p>Our biggest challenge was working on the hardware
design. When designing from scratch, there are so many different options and
paths to choose from that make it that much harder to start the design. But
after studying all of our options and deciding on the design path, everything
else fell in place. We received a lot of helpful tips from different industry
experts in terms of circuit design, SW development, CAD design (Mechanical),
and manufacturing. Obviously there were a lot of bumps along the road, and technical difficulties, but with persistence and hard work, we were able to
overcome these challenges. </p><p>Now, we have one final obstacle before we can bring
the Fig into production. That is why we need your help and support to pay for
some of the tooling costs. We also want to perform some testing in approved
labs to have proper certification before going out into the market.

<p>As we stated previously, most backup batteries in today's market only offer a 3 or 4 LED indicator for the remaining battery charge. A lot of times these LED's are very
misleading because of the cheap and inaccurate design. Not only that, but a majority of the these power banks claim to hold a charge that they truly don’t
because of the low battery grade they use. Otherwise they are too bulky or unattractive. </p><p>The Fig solves all of
these issues by accurately indicating the exact charge remaining in your battery with a
percentage indicator. Also, it lets you know exactly what your battery is doing, whether charging or discharging, and how much current
your mobile device is drawing. It also comes in a light weight, modern, and eye
catching design that is sure to attract attention when used around friends or family. Last but not least; quality. The Fig is made using the highest grade material,
(internally and externally), uses the latest processes and technologies, and uses
a battery that has a longer life than competing chargers. In fact, after
testing we noticed that when charging your phone with the Fig, the charge on
your phone lasts longer than when charged with your normal wall adapter.  Awesome right?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/360674/files/20140210082216-photo_1.JPG?1392049336"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<h1>
<br/>What is More In One?</h1>
<div>More In One is a re-thought concept of a social platform that will move socials a step forward.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It allows to easily configure a custom social environment by selecting capabilities users need; for small/medium business, fun, work or just networking.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We truly believe that socials should start a new evolution; something that can fit our personality and be integrated with our reality.</div>
<div>Socials should be as dynamic as our thoughts on life (or interactions in life) and they have to be closer to our human aspect.</div>

<h1>What More In One means?</h1>
<p>More In One (or mio) is not just a name for this product but it is the perfect match of two concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>More In One is the real human representation of a single physical person with more aspects and interests. <br/>In real life we interact with different people and we introduce ourselves in a different way based on the relationship we have established or that we want to establish in the future. <br/>We have friends, colleagues, family members and so on. For each one of them, we are not the same entity.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>More In One is modular and the nature of this system works like a container that provides many different services.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h1>Problems worth solving</h1>
<p>Social networks do not fit real life issues.</p>
<p>We spend significant hours connected on Internet and every day we use different social networks to read or share info by/with our friends/contacts. We share photos, status updates, links and so on. However, this level of interaction does not resolve our issues or needs in real life.</p>
<p>Existing social networks do not support our life making easy to plan activities such as plan to go out, meet people have (some of) our same interests or go to watch a movie.</p>
<p>Basically, they do not add experiences matching our feeling, although, they are generating new types of issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>How More In One looks like?</h1>
<p>We are spending a relevant effort to design a nice user interface and an innovative user experience and our mission is build this platform to give people a new and innovative tool. We want involve our users!<br/>Users will make a silver pledge (and up) have the chance to discuss with us some aspects during the build of the platform to make it closer to their preferences.</p>

<h1>Why More In One is different?</h1>
<p>More In One (mio) seeks to redefine social media and how people will use social networking sites.</p>
<p>More In One aims to give users the option of managing social networking, media sharing, collaboration, and various other social activities in one place.</p>
<p>It provides tools and capabilities to “do things” in life by interacting on different levels of our real aspect. Moreover, More In One aims to use only the capabilities we really want to use by configuring a custom platform which better matches our needs or interests.</p>
<p>More In One is made by free modules which users can easily use to configure their custom social environment by selecting certain capabilities they need for business purposes or fun.<br/><br/>The relevant point in More In One, at the moment, are:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Multiple profile management</strong>More In One is a service that works as a unique place able to manage specific capabilities we can only use by registering on several different sites.<br/>Inside our platform we designed improved and more powerful services in one place and all for free!<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Social networks becoming more exclusive<br/></strong>We have introduced <em>Actions</em> that can be used to involve our friends in real life.<br/>Moreover, we have designed a <em>Social Discovering</em> module able to show us new connections based on the type of connection we are looking for (at the moment).<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Privacy issues and data control<br/></strong>We have designed a better system to organize all your contacts using a real perspective of human interaction.<br/>You can manage dedicated <em>Aspects</em> as separate worlds, designating a specific profile that will fit better with each aspects and at the same time keep them well organized.<br/>We have developed a privacy control where you do not have to worry anymore about hiding or protecting your personal information, because the platform already provides a secure method to display your info without any set policy. In fact, it prevents your contacts to know more than what you want them to know. No more leaks and issues with private information and visibility.<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bridge the gap between socials and real experiences<br/></strong>More In One has been designed to be a social which better interact on different levels of our daily life. In fact, it helps its users to add real experiences in their life instead to increase a virtual life on internet.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More effective pages to promote business/hobbies<br/></strong>We are proud about our module called <em>Activities</em>. This is a clever module which allows users to easily create very powerful pages by selecting plug and play features.<strong><br/></strong>Whatever you want to promote: your rock band, your shop, your hobbies or your brand, you can now create specific pages and have e-commerce solutions and much more already embedded.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h1>Why am I building this?</h1>
<p>I have personally faced some frustrations using existing socials and have noticed how other people had the same complaints. Their feedback and encouragement to develop an alternate/enhanced social led me to work on this platform.</p>
<p>My goal is to create something useful that can influence how we make connections. I truly believe that socials should provide something more; something that can fit our personality and be integrated with our reality. Socials should be as dynamic as our thoughts on life (or interactions in life) and they have to be closer to our human aspect.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why do I need money?</h2>
<p>I developed a beta by investing my personal finances and time, but before I launch it there are things I would like to include and improve and some of the costs I cannot afford without support. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to improve my server with something stronger in order to guarantee always the best service.<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I need to enlarge the team with some developers and expert designers.<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>After introducing More In One, a percentage of the money will be invested in marketing activities when the project is ready to be launch.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>At Arnexa we have a new and innovative way of helping people develop a savings habit.  </p>
<p>A <a href=""https://goo.gl/dxepMo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">simple and elegant <strong>free </strong>iPhone app is already available</a> that demonstrates our approach to helping people set simple savings goals, report progress and <i><strong>meet </strong></i>them.</p>
<p><i><strong>This IndieGogo campaign is to fund version 2 of our app</strong></i> that adds in crucial features to help make the app more useful to users and to grow the user community.  </p>
<p>Version 2 (which we will build if we are successful in our fund raising) will also be <i><strong>free</strong></i>.   This means that (technically) you can wait for others to back version 2 - and benefit from <i>their</i> investment.   However, if after using our version 1 of the app, you are impressed, we'd welcome your backing and support.</p>
<p><i><strong>Only iPhone</strong></i> will be supported now. Android will come later unless we wildly exceed our fund raising target (would be nice, huh?).</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If someone was trying to combat alcoholism, would your only solution be sending them to class or increasing the price of their alcohol?  If someone was trying to lose weight, would you attempt to help them by only giving them better looking bathroom scales?    </p>
<p>You'd surely mock such inadequate remedies.</p>
<p>Why then if someone is struggling to save money are we not immediately repulsed that the only current answers seem to be in budget tools, classes and coupons?</p>
<p>At Arnexa, we have assembled a group of <a href=""https://arnexa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">entrepreneurs, engineers, academicians and business experts</a> with many decades of experience in entrepreneurship, software, financial institutions and economics with a unique approach to addressing the ""savings"" problem in which we <a href=""https://medium.com/arnexa/trim-tabs-and-the-savings-habit-7ffb6f7b9a1f"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>tap the motivation of individuals to do better</strong></i></a>.  How do we do this?  We address this in our introductory video  above.</p>
<p>We have already implemented the key ideas in how to motivate individuals in the first version of our app which is already available in the App Store.   Here's a quick video that walks you through the current app.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XRpWiegpTCs?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/dxepMo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Please install the app if you have an iPhone and use it now</a>.  <a href=""http://goo.gl/forms/085OElPfr1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feedback always welcome</a> (whether or not you choose to back us in our quest to develop version 2 of this app).</p>
<h2>What we plan to do with the money raised</h2>
<p>This Indiegogo project is to build <i><strong>version 2</strong></i> of our iPhone app so that we can round out the features that would be most useful for users and <i><strong>grow the user community</strong></i>. This version will provide the following high level features and will also be available FREE:</p>
<p><strong>Richer community features</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add ability for users to invite their friends and family members into Arnexa.</li>
<li>Add core ""social"" features for users to be able to share their goals and goal achievements at Facebook.  This goes to the core of the idea of celebration at the end of difficult endeavors - this helps and motivates one to keep on the savings path.</li>
<li>Today users can see the leader board entries but not the profiles of the people at the top. We plan to add this - so that users can see the profiles of those who are the top savers in Arnexa.   </li>
</ol>
<p><i>Social features are essential to savings</i> (which hitherto have been done solo).  This is because positive affirmations from family, friends (or, savings club partners, etc.) upon meeting goals really helps with motivation and drive.  </p>
<p><strong>Smarter Algorithms for Scoring &amp; Stats</strong></p>
<p>In version 1 of our app we have a basic scoring and stats engine (streaks, ranking, etc.).  In version 2 we plan to improve this as we get better &amp; more data so that the stats, notifications and other features become more compelling. For example, as time elapses and user does not make progress towards a goal, does the user run the risk of ""missing"" the goal?  Currently we have a basic ""risk assessment algorithm"".  We can fine-tune this algorithm to make sure that alerts/notifications about potential goal ""miss"" becomes more accurate and can help the ""at-risk"" user.  We discuss this aspect of ""cohort analysis"" in the video below.</p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/t9ZPgyUAetA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Acquiring a Larger User Base </strong></p>
</div>
<p>Crucial as the features that we have enumerated are, it is just as important that we also grow the number of users of the Arnexa app. The greater the number of users, the greater is the accuracy of our statistical analysis, leader boards, predictions, etc.  To grow the user base, we also will be running campaigns on social media, working with community colleges and schools which have ""financial literacy"" programs as well as employers who are interested in furthering the financial well-being of their employees.  </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are looking to raise $11,000 to build out the next version of our app (the features that will be added are listed in the previous section).   Of crucial importance is that we are interested not just in your money but in <strong><i>your use of our product</i></strong>.  Uniquely compared to other Indiegogo projects, we already have a free version of the app available for you to install and use on your iPhone<strong>.</strong>  You can use it, see if you find it beneficial, and decide for yourself whether you buy into the Arnexa vision for how people may benefit from using our app.</p>

<p>Savings (or, lack thereof) is a crucial problem in the United States.  Research has shown that the average American would have difficulty in handling an unplanned <i>$400</i> emergency (see <a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Federal Reserve Research Report on Household Economic Wellbeing May 2016</a>).  Our app cannot cure all societal ills related to savings.</p>

<p>We believe our approach can make a dent in this problem. Our approach while unique in the savings arena has nonetheless been widely used in other areas to help athletes gain superior performance, addicts to combat addictions, etc.  In each area, the central tenets underlying the Arnexa app have been shown to work.  </p>

<h2>Important Notes &amp; Caveats</h2>
<p>Remember that the <i><strong>version 2 of our app will only support iPhones</strong></i>.  If you have an Android (or, other) device, we plan to support those other devices at a later date.

</div></div>","Executive Summary
At Arnexa we have a new and innovative way of helping people develop a savings habit.  
A simple and elegant free iPhone app is already available that demonstrates our approach to helping people set simple savings goals, report progress and meet them.
This IndieGogo campaign is to fund version 2 of our app that adds in crucial features to help make the app more useful to users and to grow the user community.  
Version 2 (which we will build if we are successful in our fund raising) will also be free.   This means that (technically) you can wait for others to back version 2 - and benefit from their investment.   However, if after using our version 1 of the app, you are impressed, we'd welcome your backing and support.
Only iPhone will be supported now. Android will come later unless we wildly exceed our fund raising target (would be nice, huh?).
Overview
If someone was trying to combat alcoholism, would your only solution be sending them to class or increasing the price of their alcohol?  If someone was trying to lose weight, would you attempt to help them by only giving them better looking bathroom scales?    
You'd surely mock such inadequate remedies.
Why then if someone is struggling to save money are we not immediately repulsed that the only current answers seem to be in budget tools, classes and coupons?
At Arnexa, we have assembled a group of entrepreneurs, engineers, academicians and business experts with many decades of experience in entrepreneurship, software, financial institutions and economics with a unique approach to addressing the ""savings"" problem in which we tap the motivation of individuals to do better.  How do we do this?  We address this in our introductory video  above.
We have already implemented the key ideas in how to motivate individuals in the first version of our app which is already available in the App Store.   Here's a quick video that walks you through the current app.

Please install the app if you have an iPhone and use it now.  Feedback always welcome (whether or not you choose to back us in our quest to develop version 2 of this app).
What we plan to do with the money raised
This Indiegogo project is to build version 2 of our iPhone app so that we can round out the features that would be most useful for users and grow the user community. This version will provide the following high level features and will also be available FREE:
Richer community features

Add ability for users to invite their friends and family members into Arnexa.
Add core ""social"" features for users to be able to share their goals and goal achievements at Facebook.  This goes to the core of the idea of celebration at the end of difficult endeavors - this helps and motivates one to keep on the savings path.
Today users can see the leader board entries but not the profiles of the people at the top. We plan to add this - so that users can see the profiles of those who are the top savers in Arnexa.   

Social features are essential to savings (which hitherto have been done solo).  This is because positive affirmations from family, friends (or, savings club partners, etc.) upon meeting goals really helps with motivation and drive.  
Smarter Algorithms for Scoring & Stats
In version 1 of our app we have a basic scoring and stats engine (streaks, ranking, etc.).  In version 2 we plan to improve this as we get better & more data so that the stats, notifications and other features become more compelling. For example, as time elapses and user does not make progress towards a goal, does the user run the risk of ""missing"" the goal?  Currently we have a basic ""risk assessment algorithm"".  We can fine-tune this algorithm to make sure that alerts/notifications about potential goal ""miss"" becomes more accurate and can help the ""at-risk"" user.  We discuss this aspect of ""cohort analysis"" in the video below.


 
Acquiring a Larger User Base 

Crucial as the features that we have enumerated are, it is just as important that we also grow the number of users of the Arnexa app. The greater the number of users, the greater is the accuracy of our statistical analysis, leader boards, predictions, etc.  To grow the user base, we also will be running campaigns on social media, working with community colleges and schools which have ""financial literacy"" programs as well as employers who are interested in furthering the financial well-being of their employees.  

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise $11,000 to build out the next version of our app (the features that will be added are listed in the previous section).   Of crucial importance is that we are interested not just in your money but in your use of our product.  Uniquely compared to other Indiegogo projects, we already have a free version of the app available for you to install and use on your iPhone.  You can use it, see if you find it beneficial, and decide for yourself whether you buy into the Arnexa vision for how people may benefit from using our app.
If you do happen to buy our vision, we'd love your help in funding version 2 of the app and growing the user ecosystem.  
When Will You Get Version 2? 
We plan to roll out features as soon as they become ready.  Some features like social media support may roll out as early as September, others such as better analytics and scoring will roll out later in the Fall (October/November).

Thank you!</p></div>","The FanMian cable is a very powerful tool. It’s a first-of-its-kind dual-direction, fast-charging, multi-device, robust, repairable data and power cable. Yes – it does all that! 2.1 billion people now own and use a smart phone. In fact, many of you own two. And you probably know a friend or family member who owns a different type of device than you do. Even at home, regardless of what type of phone you own, you and your family need many types of cables, from the micro USB to the Apple Lightning to the USB-C, which will be universal cable of the future. On top of your phone, you use so many other devices too. At any given time, you likely have headphones, a portable charger, portable speaker or GPS sat-nav in your car – all of which need to be charged too.How many cables do you need to keep your devices charged?Answer: Probably too many to count! That means a cable for each device, plus backups for those cables. In the end, you have to carry a whole tangle of cables to keep your devices running smoothly.It’s a waste of time and space to carry so many cables for all your devices and the situations you might find ourselves in.And most cables you own are made to deteriorate. They are made from cheap materials and are designed to break. (And evil plan to force you to buy new ones.)The FanMian cable can literally be compatible with all devices on the market . Life is too short to fuss over long, tangled cables - tailor the FanMian cable to suit your needs. If you need a long cable, leave it as is. If you want a short cable – simply cut it to size. You can even turn the remaining cable into a second (or third) custom cable – nothing goes to waste. How easy is it to customize the FanMian cable?It’s as easy as 1,2,3.1. To create your custom cable, use the tool to cut it to the desired length, then:2. Open the latch-clamp on the single form and click it back into place over the end of the cut cable.  3. If required, change the adaptor on the un-cut end to customize the cable as needed to connect your required devices.  1· USB-C adaptor futureproofs your device so that you can use it with newer laptops, tablets and other mobile devices. · Lightning adaptor can be used with current iPhone and iPads.· Micro-USB adaptor – the most widely used adaptor everywhere.· USB adaptor – connect to almost every laptop in the world or mobile charger.Stop worrying about untangling cables. You no longer have to wrestle with cable ties to get your multiple cables in order either. And since you won’t have cables running across your table-tops or sticking out of every power socket, your room will look neat, tidy and free of clutter.Unlike most other cables, the FanMian cable is made from the highest quality materials. It’s outer cover is made of durable yet soft TPE flame-retardant material while the inner lining protects the corrosion-resistant zinc alloy wiring, sheltering it from the outside air, ensuring it’s free from the risk of oxidization.The FanMian has an embedded smart chip that recognises the device it is connected to and ensures that the right electrical current is supplied to it. And even if there’s a worn section, all you need to do is cut the worn section off, then continue using the rest of the cable.   The OTG function enables power to be interchanged between two mobile phones.Instantly turn your phone into a power-bank.Meaning it’s able to turn your mobile phone into an emergency mobile charger to help you power your additional devices or simply help a friend charge theirs.

<h3>Why This Exists</h3>
<p>I've been a Systems Engineer for over ten years designing mission-critical systems which provides the necessary knowledge to combine various intricate systems together and work fluidly.  In addition, I was involved in the ideation process within Motorola for more than four years, evaluating ideas along with providing feedback for many aspects of design, including mobile phone design.</p>
<p>I've been designing this in my head for more than two years. I was prepared to design this system for Project Ara, Google's modular phone, and attended both DevCons, but when that platform fell through my plans were put on hold.  With the MotoMod platform and being selected as a finalist, I have a chance to create something that will be beneficial to those who need it.</p>
<p>Although I am not vision-impaired, nor do I know anyone who is, I have always been troubled by technology's steady march toward becoming increasingly visual.  Phones with a physical keyboard were once commonplace but are now a rarity; this could hinder the ability of visually-impaired users to effectively use their phones. While advancements in screen size and resolution assist with vision-impaired, it does not directly assist those who are blind. And while voice dictation can be used, it's cumbersome and doesn't allow for pauses for a user to think.</p>
<p>So, why do it?  <strong>I love design.  I love technology. And I think it's meant for everyone.</strong></p>
<p>I tried to use the voice navigation within Android, and it's an extremely frustrating experience.  It is extremely difficult to navigate and use, doesn't allow for privacy of the user unless they constantly have headphones, and is troublesome for those who read faster than a voice speaks.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>This is a starting point to determine if this is something that people wish to have developed.  Users with disabilities should not be left behind while technology progresses.  Braille keyboards are extremely large and expensive.  </span></p>
<p>One of the issues is that I need to be vague to protect patentable concepts while still providing enough details for individuals to stand behind.  The answers will be in the patents and the features that they will provide.  There are two designs planned, one for a single character and one for multiple.  The single character design is planned around six actuators, whereas the multiple character design will have a custom design.  Software design will have custom features to display the information normally onscreen with user personalization.</p>
<p>A presentation is available for Motorola upon request.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount requested will not be capable of providing a finalized product. Funding will go towards the costs of equipment, prototyping, printing/molding, and outside assistance. The primary costs covered will be an oscilloscope for debugging communications issues, ordering custom actuators, and contract or direct 3D printing and molding.  For example, the actuator company I just spoke to requires a $14,000 payment just for a feasibility study.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>One of the things that has bothered me about crowdsourcing projects I've funded in the past is the opacity as to the status of the project and what the funding is being used for; this will not happen with my project.  There will be at a minimum monthly updates for one year or the life of the stage, whichever is longer.  When you donate, you'll find out exactly what it was used for, including any crowdfunding fees (which can be up to 10% of the amount raised depending upon contribution method).</span></p>
<p>As this is a fixed funding, if the total amount isn't raised, no funds are received and no perks will be provided.  However, I'll still send a thank-you email, it's the least I can do.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are an estimated 6.6 million in the US alone who have reported a visual disability, and the World Health Organization estimates 39 million blind and almost a quarter of a billion with low vision.  According to the National Federation of the Blind, over 80% of gainfully employed blind people utilize braille every day.  However, one aspect that limits Braille use to just 10% of blind users in the US is access.</p>
<p>Portable Bluetooth Braille displays cost over $1000, have a strap to hang around the user's neck, and are limited in the number of characters.  This is a huge burden both physically and financially, and I want to address it.  With advancements in technology the potential exists for a design that is less obtrusive, more integrated, and especially less expensive.</p>

<h3>Phases</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create small batch to verify design</li>
<li>Iterate through 3D printing</li>
<li>Blind user testing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The primary risk is too narrow of a market.  This would be for a certain type of phone, would be subject to mechanical and electrical changes in the future, and this could affect development.  The other primary risk is mechanical failure that would compromise the functionality of the unit as a whole.</p>
<p>The best way to address both issues is with a finalized modular design, both in construction and internal design.  With a modular frame, as long as the size does not exceed the area allowed on the phone, it can be adapted to fit different devices.  Internal self-reliance allows for less dependencies on other platforms, and allows for possibilities with Bluetooth as a future option.</p>
<p>Ideally, internal components would be modular as well, allowing for replacement of components to account for the eventual mechanical or electrical failure.  This may add height to the final design, but I feel this is a worthwhile tradeoff.</p>
<p>The final component is where possible, the design will be 3D printed which will allow for flexibility of sources and readily created replacement parts.</p>

<p>How do you congratulate a close person on a special day ? Think about it for a moment and be honest. Do you congratulate him personally or do you call him ? The fact is that many people don´t have or take the time for a short phone call or personal congratulations. Instead, they send short messages, images from the Internet or old congratulations they once got themselves. In the age of messaging services, only impersonal messages are sent for each occasion.</p>

<p>Only a few make the effort to send something personal. In addition, the convenience is another problem. A short message is written faster than the search for a greeting card or a matching image on the internet.</p>

How do you congratulate a close person on a special day ? Think about it for a moment and be honest. Do you congratulate him personally or do you call him ? The fact is that many people don´t have or take the time for a short phone call or personal congratulations. Instead, they send short messages, images from the Internet or old congratulations they once got themselves. In the age of messaging services, only impersonal messages are sent for each occasion.

 
Don`t you know this situation too? It's Christmas and you always get the same impersonal greeting cards, sayings or short videos from different people. That sucks, it`s boring and can spoil one's mood.

 
It's your birthday and all your friends will send you short impersonal messages with emojis. Or worse, nobody remembers your special day. That can be really hurtful.

 
Many have the problem that they often travel on business and work long. They simply have no time or forget important days of their loved ones. This often leads to disputes in relationships and hurts other people's feelings.
Only a few make the effort to send something personal. In addition, the convenience is another problem. A short message is written faster than the search for a greeting card or a matching image on the internet.

 

WishU is a unique application designed to help people. It combines several functions in one and therefore it can prevent many problems. WishU offers his user the possibility to communicate in the form of a chat between two persons with text and picture messages. Furthermore, the user can create freely designed Wishes and send them automatically throughout the year. WishU also reminds you a few days in advance if someone from your contacts list is celebrating an event soon.

<p> <b>Here, we would like to introduce more about  “<b>Harrier Cable</b>” and “<b>Rainbow Cable</b>”.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Smart phones and tablets which gradually replace the PC become the main devices in daily entertainment, communication and office. OTG technology makes the function of smart phones and tablets extended unlimited.  Recently, mobile phone manufacturers pay more attention to the OTG technology and gradually apply it in the  mobile phone and tablets.</p>
<p>Currently, 90 percent of OTG cables only have the single-function, and the other 10 percent cables only have the one-way mode.</p>
<p>As we known, as the main accessories of mobile phones and tablets, the most important function of the data cable is charging;  then is data transmission and support OTG application. So, we always bring along a data cable to charge our phone when we are out of the door. Few of us remember to bring a single function OTG cable. It is quite inconvenient for us to take along two cables with us. To resolve the problem, we develop two new products named “<b>Harrier Cable</b>” and “<b>Rainbow Cable</b>”.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<p>You may notice that most smart phones and tablets have OTG function. If users can experience the convenience of OTG function, that will be a trend. So, <b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">“<b>Harrier Cable</b>” </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">and</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> “<b>Rainbow Cable</b>”</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> may be one of the lead products in this area!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4></h4>
<p><b>""Harrier cable""</b> combines two cables together and it has a very lovely shape, just like a love dog. It is not only useful, but also has a good visual image. We believe most of you will like it!</p>

<h3>Product advantages:</h3>
<p>With two modes of data cable and OTG function, “Harrier Cable” and “Rainbow Cable” can be charging for mobile phone, data transmission and support OTG application at any time. Meanwhile, the cable supports several cables to charge the mobile phone and tablets at the same time. they can share one USB port.</p>
<p>Data cable mode supports data transfer and charging for mobile phones; USB female socket can be used as an extended port to realize multi-line shared pattern. </p>
<p>OTG mode supports the mobile phones and tablets to read USB drive, connect keyboard, mouse, camera, MP3, printer and another mobile phone.</p>

<h3>Thanks for your support!</h3>
</div></div>","Here, we would like to introduce more about  “Harrier Cable” and “Rainbow Cable”.

Smart phones and tablets which gradually replace the PC become the main devices in daily entertainment, communication and office. OTG technology makes the function of smart phones and tablets extended unlimited.  Recently, mobile phone manufacturers pay more attention to the OTG technology and gradually apply it in the  mobile phone and tablets.
Currently, 90 percent of OTG cables only have the single-function, and the other 10 percent cables only have the one-way mode.
As we known, as the main accessories of mobile phones and tablets, the most important function of the data cable is charging;  then is data transmission and support OTG application. So, we always bring along a data cable to charge our phone when we are out of the door. Few of us remember to bring a single function OTG cable. It is quite inconvenient for us to take along two cables with us. To resolve the problem, we develop two new products named “Harrier Cable” and “Rainbow Cable”.






You may notice that most smart phones and tablets have OTG function. If users can experience the convenience of OTG function, that will be a trend. So, “Harrier Cable” and “Rainbow Cable” may be one of the lead products in this area!



""Harrier cable"" combines two cables together and it has a very lovely shape, just like a love dog. It is not only useful, but also has a good visual image. We believe most of you will like it!

Product advantages:
With two modes of data cable and OTG function, “Harrier Cable” and “Rainbow Cable” can be charging for mobile phone, data transmission and support OTG application at any time. Meanwhile, the cable supports several cables to charge the mobile phone and tablets at the same time. they can share one USB port.
Data cable mode supports data transfer and charging for mobile phones; USB female socket can be used as an extended port to realize multi-line shared pattern. 
OTG mode supports the mobile phones and tablets to read USB drive, connect keyboard, mouse, camera, MP3, printer and another mobile phone.

Basic Features:



Support two operation modes transferred freely.
Under data cable mode to realize basic needs of power charge and data transmission.
Under OTG mode,  your smart phone and tablets can connect the  peripheral electronic equipments.
The most commonly use is to connect your smart phones and tablets to the USB drive, keyboard, mouse, camera, MP3, printer and even another phone.
Without PC, you can also do everything PC does.
Multi-lines share one MIC_USB port to charge for more than one device at the same time.
Small body, big function.
Suitable for all smart phones and tablets with OTG function.

 






Five kinds of color for  ""Harrier Cable” 
Special features:


A lovely cartoon harrier design adds joys to your daily life.
The visual impact would be great.
The design with USB AF insert to AM is very convenient.
Tie the cable to your key chains or bags to save the room.

We estimate that will need ~7000$.

1-2 servers ( 1 for call/messages and 1 for Cloud).
2-3 programmers (1 for Android, 1 for Cloud and 1 to work with me, programming Cally).
1-2 Computers (PC+Monitor+Pheripherics).
some testing modules( Arduino + sim-cards,phones,etc).
Website
marketing,advertising
maybe some rental space to work

    The Impact Why to invest in Cally ? Because it will be revolutionary.
Now everyone can have an virtual smartphone.
Versions:



Standard Edition: Call,messages,media,apps    Price: 3-4$


Pro Edition: Standard Edition features + real phone calls,messages,media sync.                                                                                    Price: 5-6$

Skins not included, cost 1$ per skin.

Stage of project and future:

         For now Cally is ~10% complete but with 1 member(me) and in 1 week.
         Deadline: September 2015.
Future:    - December 2015:  finish  sim-card module so users have a real phone                                                                   number.
                   - 2016:  develop a OS for Cally.

<p dir=""ltr"">Everything´s OK is new project being built out by two entrepreneurs (Matt &amp; Phil) with a goal to improve the safety of both children and teens when they are out of house.  When we initially came up with this idea, we saw that there were already several systems on the market that did this, but all required that your child or teen had an expensive iphone or some other type of smart phone.  We don't think it is fair that parents should have to buy a smartphone just for peace of mind, so we designed a product which helps keep children safe using a plain-ol-lowtech-cellphone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>We have been working on this product for the past year, and have a strong proof of concept, but need to raise money in order to make it ready to launch.  If you have children, and think that this type of system would be useful, then please contribute!</strong></p>

Upon receipt of the text message, the teenager has 30 minutes to respond with any text message, whether “yes”, “ya”, “you bet”, etc...

So long as the teenager continues to respond to the text messages throughout the evening, parents can relax and know that their kids are safe.
If the monitoring curfew time is used, then the teenager must respond with a predetermined password in order to shut off the monitoring.  This password can either be given to the teenager before they leave, or if there is concern about breaking curfew, written on a note and pasted on the fridge after they leave.
If the monitor has not been shut off by the time the curfew time is reached, the parents will also receive a call, notifying them that their teenager is ok, but is out past curfew.

Sadly we know we are living a life that most of the world can only dream about.

<p>2. Local social media marketing team(s) $2,000</p>

In A NutshellNOAH is a humble vessel that houses your cables with a simple twist. Designed with basic necessities in mind, NOAH can efficiently store, organise and shorten laptop and phone cables on the tablescape.
Cables are great. They connect us with the world.  But let’s face it. The cables sitting on your desktop are just plain messy. 


Existing solutions, big or small, either keep the cables in place or hide the clutter. However, both ends fail to offer the flexibility of storage within a modest package. 







Quick & Convenient Access l NOAH's lid pops right off with a simple nudge to reveal the storage within. This also works when cables are in place too!



Simple Gestures l By forming a single loop, your cables can be instantly shortened. This is also the key step that gives NOAH the magic touch to lengthen or shorten your cables. Naturally, forming more loops allows you to store greater lengths too.


Modest Mechanics l The humble zig-zag structure serves to organise your cables into 3 levels. It also serves as a springboard that helps with the lid removal. 


Snug Fit l NOAH's tapered design guides the lid to snap comfortably in place. Thanks to the tapered form, cable storage and removal can be done even when NOAH is flushed against a flat wall. 



PRESTO! Flexibility To Extend Your Cables l A simple tug is all you require to 'lengthen' your cables. Likewise, a quick push allows you to 'shorten' it once again. 



More Than Just A Paperweight l NOAH spots an inviting surface for your convenient storage. 



Tailored For Your Lifestyle l Nestled on your desk, NOAH is a beauty to behold.



Design Anatomy l NOAH spots a sturdy ABS (Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene) frame and is coupled with a silicon base for traction to ensure it never slips.







NOAH In Your Style l At this moment, NOAH is available in Chalk Grey and Carbon Black. With a little more, you can add a splash of colour to NOAH. NOAH's base is currently available in other colours like Plum Red, Tangerine & Midnight Blue.

<p>At first, you need turn on the switch. The screen will display the current time, steps and battery indicator.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you push the button once, the OLED screen will be on for several seconds and then it will turn itself off to save power. The battery can last for a week, so you need recharge it in time. You can review the steps on the OLED screen even in low-light environments.</li>
<li>When you push the button once again while the screen is on, it will display the current date, distance and calories respectively.</li>
<li>When you push the button twice quickly while the screen is on, it will turn on the bluetooth to accept new connection. The Bluetooth of pedometer is in slave mode. So your application needs to connect to the pedometer in advance. The pedometer time can't be retaining after it's turned off. So you need to send a time string to synchronize its time, such as ""T1325419200"", T with the seconds since Jan 1 1970. When you send 'R' to the pedometer, it will return all 7 days data in JSON format with prefix ""datastart"" and suffix ""dataend"".</li>

The pedometer can track your daily steps. The pedometer is based on ADXL345 3-axis digital accelerometer. It can filter irregular activities and save last 7 days data. You can use the smart phone application to read the steps and corresponding time.

The functional prototype
Hardware devices consist of mechanics, electronics and firmware. The 3D printed prototype has taken one engineer and one industrial designer over two months to finalize. The electronics and firmware has taken even longer to develop.

Designs

PCB and prototypes

Fihuo pedometer comes in different colors
Technical specifications

ADXL345 3-axis digital accelerometer, resolution increases with g range, up to 13-bit resolution at ±16 g (maintaining 4 mg/LSB scale factor in all g ranges)
Wide temperature range (-40°C to +85°C)
Bluetooth 2.0 wireless connectivity for Android devices
0.91"" OLED display with 128*32 pixels
Built-in 70 mA lithium battery with 7 days standby time
Micro-USB port for charging and connecting to computer
58x25x9 millimeters small

The option of Bluetooth 4.0 for iPhone devices will be available soon. The Bluetooth 4.0 will always be active in this case while the Bluetooth 2.0 for Android devices is off usually and will be turned on manually before connection.
How to use

At first, you need turn on the switch. The screen will display the current time, steps and battery indicator.

When you push the button once, the OLED screen will be on for several seconds and then it will turn itself off to save power. The battery can last for a week, so you need recharge it in time. You can review the steps on the OLED screen even in low-light environments.
When you push the button once again while the screen is on, it will display the current date, distance and calories respectively.
When you push the button twice quickly while the screen is on, it will turn on the bluetooth to accept new connection. The Bluetooth of pedometer is in slave mode. So your application needs to connect to the pedometer in advance. The pedometer time can't be retaining after it's turned off. So you need to send a time string to synchronize its time, such as ""T1325419200"", T with the seconds since Jan 1 1970. When you send 'R' to the pedometer, it will return all 7 days data in JSON format with prefix ""datastart"" and suffix ""dataend"".
          For example:
            datastart
            {
                ""TOTAL"":4513,
                ""LIST"":
                [
                    {""TIME"":1349085981,""STEPS"":381},
                    {""TIME"":1349222341,""STEPS"":27},
                    {""TIME"":1349308740,""STEPS"":686},

<h2><strong>How it all came along</strong></h2>
<p>Hi there! Welcome to our project.</p>
<p>We are two 18 year old boys from Norway trying to make it. We have no business education, no mentors/parents educating us, no written out path laid out for us to walk on. Quite frankly, we have been pushed in the other direction of our hearts. By our parents, by our comrades, by our teachers and by our community. But, that didn't stop us. In 2018 we decided to take a leap of faith and start our own corporation. We already had a lot of great ideas together and decided this is something we had to act on. Things escalated and got serious pretty fast. When we first started we didn't know a lot. We had to research, study and find out about things on our own. We still don't know it all, but I like to think that we have come a long way. We used the means we had, and just went with it.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h2>The name and logo</h2>
<p>Everything started with an idea of making new innovative products. But, we quickly realized that there's just so much more to it. We had to create a name for ourselves and a logo to go with it. After a lot of brainstorming we came up with ""Dropasmile"". The story behind our name, is simple that we want to make products that bring enjoyment into people's lives. We want to spread happiness through our own products, and ""Drop a smile"" on any customers face. And with that, we have created a logo that goes well with the name. The logo is built up like a drop of water, but has a shininess to it. So it has two meanings. The first meaning is just wordplay, ""dropasmile"" on your face with the waterdrop logo, but it can also mean that it is a tear, but the diamond shining through reflects that it is happy tears.</p>
<p>Dropasmile - <i>Turn the negative into a positive</i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554411174/nzeqkcxrzvx7npe04qso.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The product</h2>
<p>This is the first idea we want to go forth with. The idea came together after a lot of frustration using our phones, trying to get a comfortable grip. We just knew there was a better way. In the process of designing the holder, we realized that we not only wanted to create a helpful product. We wanted to make the product fun also. Thats why we added the spinning function. The spinning function lets you spin the phone in any direction like a fidget spinner. The ball bearing makes the spinning smooth and also makes it last long. This can be used as just a fun gadget to fiddle with, pastime and release stress. </p>
<p>The rubberized grip is detachable and can be swapped out with different colors and sizes. We will make all kinds of different color and sizes, so everyone is happy. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554411713/rghtydsdqbzhpcgjw11b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The products is quite big and goes out a bit. But to make this comfortable to have in your pocket and so on, we are making it so you can fold it down against the phone. When flipped up in stationary position, it ""clicks"" into place so it doesn't move around or fold by accident. It can also be used in folded position by having your fingers against the phone.</p>

<h2>Product description</h2>
<p>The product will be produced in top notch quality. We will work hard to ensure that every customer is happy. The product will get delivered in safe packaging with instructions. You can easily attach it to your phone by the strong double sided tape under the mounting plate.</p>

<h2>Our plan</h2>
<p>Our plan is to start production as soon as possible. Our production team are waiting for our start signal, and this indiegogo is what will really push it even further. Things will go faster, and if the indiegogo comes through we will be up and running in a few months time. The product will then get shipped out to all of our backers and the deadline for this is set to be in december. The goal is set to 6000 USD. This will help us get all the machines and the production going. This may seem like a lot, but we are really passionate about bringing quality into the market and quality machines are expensive.</p>
<p>Our long term plan is to have a store with 10+ innovative, self made products. We are already sitting on 5-6 ideas with a lot of potential, so this is only the beginning. We will also work more on building our brand and branching out.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why do we care?</h2>
<p>We have very creative personalities, so we want to make a future for ourself in something we enjoy and are really passionate about. And also share our creativity, bring enjoyment to others and bring new exciting quality products into the market.</p>
<p>We are still very young, so we also want to inspire other young people and show them that they can do anything they want. It's not about the age. If anything, the younger you are when you start, the better. The experiences you get at a young age are so important. We have noticed just since we started, that there is nothing like this you can learn in school. You have to get out there, get experience, fail and learn from your mistakes. If you're sitting on an idea of what you want to be doing, but too obsessed with what other people might think. We are here to say that we support you and really hope that you begin your journey and start executing. </p>

</ul></div>","We took the humble pocket clip and added smart features to solve all the ways you want to carry your phone. The ring gives you a solid one-handed grip on the go, lying down, sitting up, upside down, playing games, shooting video, or taking selfies. Landscape or portrait. Reach every corner of your phone with one hand without adjusting your grip. The Clip holds tight to your pockets or your bag. Your phone is always in fast reach. It's also a kickstand with a slick all-metal mechanism to hold your phone in portrait or landscape.  P O C K E T C L I PThe Westa Clip was inspired by the pocket clips found on many everyday carry items such as pocket knives, lights, and pens. We were frustrated by the lack of a similar clip for the one item almost everybody carries every day, so we made one. The clip makes access to the phone fast and simple. No more digging through pockets or dropping an expensive phone in the bottom of pockets with items which can scar or tarnish it. Clip it to your pants. Or a bag. G R I PPhones keep getting bigger, yet our hands stay the same size making parts of the screen hard to reach. By gripping the phone by its center, the corners of the screen are easier to reach. The Westa Clip’s patent-pending ring grip provides multiple comfortable grip options. Try the inside of the ring or wrap a finger around its outside. The smooth texture allows for a variety of comfortable grip options. Reach your whole screen with one hand. Flip your screen effortlessly. K I C K S T A N D There are grips. There are kickstands. Some do both. None do both as gracefully as the Westa Clip. With the push of a button, you can convert the clip into a steady kickstand. The dual locking mechanism will hold a phone at a handy 75 degrees in portrait or landscape. The versatile kickstand is great for video conferencing, watching videos, FaceTime, following recipes. It's perfect for recording TikToks, workout videos, dance how-tos, or whatever else you creators can come up with! Press the button to release the precision lock and convert the clip into a kickstand.    L I E S  F L A TUnlike many phone grips and stands, the Westa Clip lies flat. No more wobbling screens as you try to use your phone.  W I R E L E S SThe Westa Clip works with wireless chargers in the open position. U N I V E R S A L The Westa Clip fits many phone cases using a 3M industrial adhesive. This is the same stuff they use instead of rivets to bond sheet metal and to attach GoPros to Formula 1 cars. It's strong. Just peel, place, press, and go. We recommend attaching your Westa Clip to a hard, flat case for a permanent bond. See the FAQ below for more details on the best ways to use your Westa Clip and a note on attaching the clip directly to glass-backed phones. M A T E R I A L SThe Westa Clip is made from high-quality materials. Aluminum for the clip arm, button, and locking mechanism. And EMS Grivory for the base. Grivory is an exotic composite polymer that's used in specialized metal-replacement applications. If you're a collector of high-end knives, you might recognize the name. It's really cool stuff!Always keep it in reach. The Westa Clip was designed to be used with the phone inside the pocket and the clip lever on the outside of the pocket. Hold the phone with your pointer or middle finger in the ring. Or wrap it over the top. Or try pinching it with two fingers. Lots of options! Do you use your phone in bed? Yes, of course you do. Finally, you can lie on your side with your phone propped at a comfortable angle without it flopping over. Push the side button, lift the lever open, and enjoy your phone in landscape or portrait. Push the side button again to release the lock. You might not think halving the time it takes to get to your phone is important to you. Until you get used to it. Do you remember the last time you forgot to turn your ringer off in a meeting or a movie? The Westa Clip works best on smooth, hard cases with a flat surface under the clip. The other thing to keep in mind is the location of your cameras and fingerprint readers. With the clip attached at the bottom of the phone as we recommend, it most likely won't interfere with your phone's features.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">There are other smart doorbells available. So what makes FlexiBell better? The good thing about FlexiBell is, that it's actually rather dumb! In a good way. FlexiBell does not require internet access to function. Neither do its users. There's no app needed to use FlexiBell. The device works <i>via</i> mobile network to deliver a simple phone call. FlexiBell is ideal for outside conditions, it is durable in contact with rain and wind so it can be installed also to the gate. FlexiBell has a gate opening function, if the customer has an automated gate.</p>

<p>We want to produce a doorbell that is elegant and easy to use for everyone. The bell has to be equally easy to use for a courier or a toddler. This is why it has only one button and works through a mobile network. Existing smart doorbells are too complicated to use and they work mainly with WiFi, but what if the WiFi is not accessible? With FlexiBell it will never happen and we need your help to bring FlexiBell to the market.</p>

There are other smart doorbells available. So what makes FlexiBell better? The good thing about FlexiBell is, that it's actually rather dumb! In a good way. FlexiBell does not require internet access to function. Neither do its users. There's no app needed to use FlexiBell. The device works via mobile network to deliver a simple phone call. FlexiBell is ideal for outside conditions, it is durable in contact with rain and wind so it can be installed also to the gate. FlexiBell has a gate opening function, if the customer has an automated gate.
 
KEY FEATURES


 
HOW TO START FLEXIBELLING

FlexiBell is effortless to install:
1
The device has a SIM card already. You just have to mount the metal istallation plate on to the wall or the gate.
2
Connect low voltage power cables.
3
Activate FlexiBell using the app*. It's ready to use!
______*the app is only needed for setup
 
COLOUR OPTIONS

FlexiBell comes in three tones. To blend in. Or stand out. It's up to the user. 
 
WHY FLEXIBELL

Who could benefit from FlexiBell:

Anyone living in a private house or detached house
Small companies and stores
Hotels and hostels
AirBnB enthusiasts

Situations when you benefit from FlexiBell:

Your children can call you at any time, when they loose their keys and the mobile phone is empty or missing.
Your neighbors can always communicate with you, even when you are travelling.
Your delivery guy or postman can reach you every time.
It is common for burglars to ring doorbells before they act, with FlexiBell they think you are always home.
If you have little children  who take a nap then ordinary “ding-dong” bells are noisy and therefore cause more stress. 

It's easy to use for everyone. Installing it is no rocket science. It does not require an internet connection. Works via mobile network with a pre-installed SIM. Compatible with any phone.

 
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP

Albert Einstein once said that if you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself. We took it a little bit further and say that if your dog can understand it, it is simple!
We want to produce a doorbell that is elegant and easy to use for everyone. The bell has to be equally easy to use for a courier or a toddler. This is why it has only one button and works through a mobile network. Existing smart doorbells are too complicated to use and they work mainly with WiFi, but what if the WiFi is not accessible? With FlexiBell it will never happen and we need your help to bring FlexiBell to the market.
 
WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT

1. We have produced 10 FlexiBells in a real manufacturing site. The electronics have been manufactured and the housings have been made using molds.2. We have a lot of orders from businesses and we want to launch an Indiegogo campaign to also reach our private customers.3. We have agreed conditions with manufacturers. FlexiBell will be produced in Estonia.4. We have an agreement with a Vodafone subsidiary for mobile service.
 
TIMELINE


WHERE THE FUNDS WILL GO

We already have a working prototype and now we’re looking for funds to put FlexiBell into mass production. We know what we’re doing; We have the know-how and skills to do it because we've led the development and manufacturing of other hardware products in previous companies, including Myoton Muscle Diagnostics, Airpatrol air conditioner controller that can be managed via cell phone, the first GPS / GSM car security system, Fleximoover a disabled children's rehabilitation training device.
Now we just need your help to bring FlexiBell to customer!

RISKS

There's always risks that can delay the process before FlexiBell gets into your hands. We thought it might be good to share some of them so you know what we are dealing with.
Component supply: FlexiBell, or any product for that matter, contains a significant amount of components. These components come from different suppliers which have different lead times for their components. If ONE of these suppliers has a short supply or a long lead time this will delay the entire production if a substitute is not found for that component.

Enhancements in production: When in production there are a couple of parameters that can be improved during the process such as the color, click feeling, translucence, IP code etc. Making such enhancements during the process will be in order to improve your experience with FlexiBell. We will do everything we can to ensure that FlexiBell ships with superior quality.
Shipping and customs: When we start shipping there's always a risk of the product getting stuck in customs, either when we are receiving the products from the factory or shipping them to you. We have prepared as well as we can and hopefully there won't be any delays.

<p>My name is Daniel Berenguer and I am the founder of the <a href=""http://www.panstamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>panStamp</em></a> project. As a freelance electronic architect, I’ve been faced with dozens of situations where measurements had to be transmitted wirelessly to remote IP servers. In every case, I realized that there was no easy way to accomplish this without developing custom gateways and IP services or even building custom hardware. There was no way for professionals or enthusiasts to create wireless sensor/actuator networks hooked to the cloud without spending too much time and money or relying on proprietary “black boxes”. Some of the current available solutions allow us to create low-power wireless networks for metering and automation projects. Some other solutions concentrate on providing cloud data storage and graphic representation. However, there is still a gap between both sides of the picture, where one has to do a large amount of work in order to bring real measurements to the IP world.</p>

<h3>How does the panStamp ecosystem work?</h3>
<p>panStamps are small wireless “Arduino clone” boards with all the necessary parts to start measuring analog and binary data and control PWM and binary loads. Data is then transmitted over the air thanks to the on-board CC1101 radio IC at 868/915 MHz. Being arduino software compatible boards, panStamps can be programmed easily from the Arduino IDE. Moreover, we provide a library that simplifies developing new applications for panStamps whilst releasing the developer from having to deal with RF-related tasks. On the other hand, anyone can use panStamps without having to develop a single line of code. By choosing any of the available application images and base boards, you will be able to set-up your own wireless network in minutes.</p>

<hr/><h2><strong><span> A revolutionary system</span></strong></h2>
<p>BlueBee is based on the Blue Crowd Search technology. This is a completely new way of thinking geolocalisation. This system taps the power of the crowd to find your lost objects, which makes it possible to build very small, affordable and power-efficient tracking devices.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://x6innovationsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/blue-crowd-search5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With ""BlueCrowdSearch"" you can find your things with the help of other BlueBee users. Wherever your lost valuables are, it can be automatically detected by the smartphone of another BlueBee user passing by, and it will notify you with the exact location. Of course, everything is automatic; other users don’t even know their devices are looking for your stuff!</p>
<p>And in order to make the Blue Crowd network even stronger we are already discussing partnerships with some of the big mobile app development companies to integrate our API into their apps. This will bring thousands of users into the Blue Crowd network from the very beginning making it ready to roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Become a premium user</h2>
<p>The Blue Crowd Search network enables long range localisation. It is the perfect solution to find a lost wallet, a stolen car or a missing pet. In order to cover our service maintenance costs, users will be invited to buy an annual subscription (starting at 15 euros/year) ... HOWEVER ...</p>
<p>We have decided that every Indiegogo contributor will be offered a FREE golden membership which provides a LIFE PASS to the Blue Crowd Search network.</p>
<p>Indeed we believe that as an Indiegogo contributor not only are you helping to create the initial core of the Blue Crowd Search user network, but you also believe in this project as much as we do and this really matters to us. Early adopters should never have to pay for the Blue Crowd Search service.</p>

<p>The BlueBee app helps you finding your things quickly and easily. It was designed with passion to be powerful and intuitive, and its polished interface will make your user experience even more appealing. </p>
<p>There are 5 great features in the app:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Bee Map</strong>: you can see on a map where and when you left your BlueBee</p>

 Put it everywhere
BlueBee is easily attached to the things you want to protect like your keys, your car, your bag, your pets or anything else you want to keep safe.
 A revolutionary system
BlueBee is based on the Blue Crowd Search technology. This is a completely new way of thinking geolocalisation. This system taps the power of the crowd to find your lost objects, which makes it possible to build very small, affordable and power-efficient tracking devices.

With ""BlueCrowdSearch"" you can find your things with the help of other BlueBee users. Wherever your lost valuables are, it can be automatically detected by the smartphone of another BlueBee user passing by, and it will notify you with the exact location. Of course, everything is automatic; other users don’t even know their devices are looking for your stuff!
And in order to make the Blue Crowd network even stronger we are already discussing partnerships with some of the big mobile app development companies to integrate our API into their apps. This will bring thousands of users into the Blue Crowd network from the very beginning making it ready to roll.
 
Become a premium user
The Blue Crowd Search network enables long range localisation. It is the perfect solution to find a lost wallet, a stolen car or a missing pet. In order to cover our service maintenance costs, users will be invited to buy an annual subscription (starting at 15 euros/year) ... HOWEVER ...
We have decided that every Indiegogo contributor will be offered a FREE golden membership which provides a LIFE PASS to the Blue Crowd Search network.
Indeed we believe that as an Indiegogo contributor not only are you helping to create the initial core of the Blue Crowd Search user network, but you also believe in this project as much as we do and this really matters to us. Early adopters should never have to pay for the Blue Crowd Search service.

 

Uncluttered and effective 

 
The BlueBee app helps you finding your things quickly and easily. It was designed with passion to be powerful and intuitive, and its polished interface will make your user experience even more appealing. 
There are 5 great features in the app:
1) Bee Map: you can see on a map where and when you left your BlueBee
2) Reminder: you can be warned when you get too far from your BlueBee
3) Smart Zone : save some safe places like your home and your office to be warned if and only if your valuables leave these Smart Zones.
4) Bee Buzz: in a 50 meters range you can see on the radar how far you are from your BlueBee and make it ring to find it quickly
5) Remote shutter: this is a fun bonus feature :) you can use the BlueBee mini-tape button to remotely shut your smartphone camera and take neat group pictures

A concentrate of technology 
BlueBee is easily attached to the things you want to protect. You can use the App to find the mini-tape and make it ring.
The BlueBee button triggers an alarm on your smartphone so that you can find it quickly and easily.

Technology will make our life better. Wireless charging is such a thing that betters our life. It is applied to phone charging now, and in the future, we believe it will be applied to more areas. We often encounter situations where the phone is out of power while driving. USB car charger is a solution, but whose charging speed is extremely slow. Power bank is another solution, but which is inconvenient to carry. So we are thinking of a device which can charge phone fast and is easy-control. So Fastpad came out. Fastpad is a 10W wireless car charger. It provides a new phone charging way while driving which helps people get rid of messy cables. Fastpad is also a phone holder. People are always distressed about no safe place for their phones while driving. Fastpad is the solution. We believe Fastpad will be the best companion beside you. In the last several months, our team was striving to perfect Fastpad 10W wireless car charger. Until now, technology has got a great improvement. For the further study and mass production, we make this campaign. We also hope more people can get pleasure from wireless car charger. Our Fastpad is ready to be your partner.</p><p> </p></div>","Fastpad 10W wireless car charger provides you with a perfect phone charging solution. It is equipped with QC3.0 adapter that you can fully enjoy fast charging. Does it always happen to you that you can’t find the phone cables? Or can’t find the jack accurately to plug in your cables?  Intelligent Control on the TemperatureAs we all know, while charging, the temperature will greatly affect the charging efficiency. What’s worse is that overheat possibly causes many hidden dangers, such as explosive and flammable. To avoid these dangers, Fastpad applies a unique optimization scheme to reduce the charging pad heat generated during charging. Fast charging with no heat protects your phone from hurt. Intelligent InductionFastpad's unique intelligent sensing system allows you to enjoy the convenience of wireless charging. The Fastpad can identify the models of mobile phones quickly and start charging automatically while you put on your phone. The charging function is only for smart phones which support Qi tech wireless charging.
 
 
 High SensitivityIt's very likely that we use cases to protect phones. Fastpad has a extremely high sensitivity, so you don't need take off your phone case while charging. However for your successful charging, we suggest that thickness of the phone case is not more than 2mm. A Large-area Induction Fastpad uses high-quality induction coils and has a larger effective induction area than traditional wireless chargers, which ensure stable charging, high conversion rate and heat dissipation. This charger supports 5W/7.5W/10W power output and is compatible with QC2.0/QC3.0 USB car charger. In order to achieve fast charging, we suggest 7.5W or 10W output with QC3.0 USB car charger. Now early bird can get free QC3.0 USB car charger!  Tightly HoldingWhen we are driving, sometimes the traditional car holder can't hold the phone firmly, we keep upgrading and testing our prototype to realise a better holding. Fastpad charger holder will hold your phone tightly even under tough driving condition.  
Opening & Closing Silently
We use high-quality stepper motor and specially-designed gear rotating which effectively reduce the noise and ensure the smooth movement. The stepper motor promotes an extremely tight locking which prevents your phone from falling.

   Your family may want to charge in the car, but there is no car holder. Have you noticed the groove at the base? With it, the wireless charger can be used as a phone holder for wired charging phones.The only thing to note is that you should be careful not to touch the extremely sensitive touching switch on the bottom to prevent your phone from falling. Selected Silica Gel Holds Your Phone WellWe know that you care about your smart phone very much. So we apply high-quality silica gel to Fastpad which does not hurt the body, and also holds the phone firmly. The stability and protection are excellent.  Non-slip Rubber Clip Clamps Vents We tried the traditional car holder mount solution, but after sun exposure, the base will be very weak after long-term use. Hence we adopted a unique clip method — mechanical fixing method, so that the wireless charger can be used in many different situations. The durability is greatly increased.  Meet Fastpad TeamWe are a team who is working out to connect technology and life. Technology will make our life better. Wireless charging is such a thing that betters our life. It is applied to phone charging now, and in the future, we believe it will be applied to more areas. We often encounter situations where the phone is out of power while driving. USB car charger is a solution, but whose charging speed is extremely slow. Power bank is another solution, but which is inconvenient to carry. So we are thinking of a device which can charge phone fast and is easy-control. So Fastpad came out. Fastpad is a 10W wireless car charger. It provides a new phone charging way while driving which helps people get rid of messy cables. Fastpad is also a phone holder. People are always distressed about no safe place for their phones while driving. Fastpad is the solution. We believe Fastpad will be the best companion beside you. In the last several months, our team was striving to perfect Fastpad 10W wireless car charger. Until now, technology has got a great improvement. For the further study and mass production, we make this campaign. We also hope more people can get pleasure from wireless car charger. Our Fastpad is ready to be your partner.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 class=""p2""><strong>Get a Working Prototype Fast</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">Our two last perks allow you to get a version of our actual working prototype. We will have to hand-solder it for you and spend some time helping you to program it. That's why it's way more expensive than the regular perks. It will not be a finish product, but you will be able to study it and have access to its source code right away. We will also send you the final version in priority when done.</p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>What's done, What's left to do</strong></h3>
<p class=""li2""><strong>Electronics:</strong> We have a solid and well tested prototype. Our actual board still features several solutions that we wanted to test. It needs to be refined for production to make it smaller and easy to manufacture. Certification are planed only for US and EU market.</p>
<p class=""li2""><strong>Enclosure:</strong> We have a printed and painted concept (used for our photographs). We need to adapt it for injection molding, and have the mold made. Only one piece is to be molded, we will use a plate for the back.</p>
<p class=""li2""><strong>Embedded Software:</strong> We have a functional version both for the Linux board (firmware running our own daemon) and the Atmel MCU. All basic features are implemented (Measurements/Sending/Receiving) and some automations, but more advanced stuff still needs to be added and tweaked.</p>
<p class=""li2""><strong>Web &amp; Mobile Dashboard:</strong> We will need to re-design a dashboard from scratch. We only need a front-end as Cosm.com handles the backend. We'd like to design that with you by submitting wireframes gather your feedback modify it, etc.</p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>Open Source &amp; <span>Collaborative Design</span><br/></strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">As members of the Maker movement we recognize the right of any customer to truly own the product he or she purchases, and to be able to modify it has he wishes. All software we wrote to run in NPlug are open source — as define by opensource.org. Though some parts, mostly written by chip manufacturers aren't.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Collaborative design might just sounds like a buzz word, but in reality it is simple. It means that we will not take your money, enclose ourself in our office and get back to you 6 months later with a product you might not want any more. Instead we will keep you updated of our progress and take your inputs in consideration. We'll have a weekly post to interact with you.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Risks and challenges</h3>
<p class=""p2"">Manufacturing: We are at our 5th iteration of the design, though we still need at least one more iteration to have only our final set of components on the board. From that we'll be able to start optimizing for our manufacturing partner. Each of these step implies a risk of additional costs and delays.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Delays: We based our time frame on what each phase should take to complete, but more importantly we monitored how much time similar project have taken to be delivered. Basically we allowed us as much time as kickstarter project's 'Twine' took to ship. It's a similar project, and it ran into a lot of issues so we think we are as realist as we can get.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Certifications: We will have to meet EMC and safety standards. We anticipated these tests. Even if no one can be 100% sure that he will pass these at the first try, our electrical engineer has successfully submitted dozens of products to test labs. We'll be extra careful with suppliers especially for the enclosure which is a major risk for an AC device to transmit fire. Regarding wireless, we are using modules that have already been approved separately to minimize risks.</p>
<h2 class=""p2""><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2 class=""p2""><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<p class=""li2""><strong>Were you rejected from Kickstarter?</strong></p>

   Internet-Augmented Electrical Outlet

NPlug measures room temperature, power consumption and can switch On/Off your electrical appliance from the web. We are integrating all automation examples from the video (scheduler, thermostat, carbon calculator, consumption limit, twitter sharing, etc.)
Precision instrument unlike most powermetters NPlug isn't a toy. We designed it to give meaningful readings even for devices consuming very little power.
Stand alone NPlug connects via WiFi. No need for a computer, a receiver  nor any additional device.
Keep control over your data which are stored on cosm.com. Cosm keeps you the sole owner of your data. You may also store your data on a USB flash drive.
Open source firmware all software we wrote for NPlug is open source.
Evolutive hardware NPlug features a programable ZigBee module to talk to existing Internet of Things products and the future ones. Its capabilities may also be extended by standard USB devices: 3G or bluetooth dongle, webcam, USB missile launcher, etc.

First demo of working prototype (1 year ago)
We are preparing a new video demoing our current working prototype. We've been iterating on our design for quite some time now, so while waiting for the new demo we propose you to watch one we made a year ago! Since then the electronic has been redesigned from scratch and we totally changed our approach of the enclosure: https://vimeo.com/55752637
By the way if you want to learn more about us or check the history of the project we created a Facebook timeline: http://www.facebook.com/nplugit

Get a Working Prototype Fast
Our two last perks allow you to get a version of our actual working prototype. We will have to hand-solder it for you and spend some time helping you to program it. That's why it's way more expensive than the regular perks. It will not be a finish product, but you will be able to study it and have access to its source code right away. We will also send you the final version in priority when done.
What's done, What's left to do
Electronics: We have a solid and well tested prototype. Our actual board still features several solutions that we wanted to test. It needs to be refined for production to make it smaller and easy to manufacture. Certification are planed only for US and EU market.
Enclosure: We have a printed and painted concept (used for our photographs). We need to adapt it for injection molding, and have the mold made. Only one piece is to be molded, we will use a plate for the back.
Embedded Software: We have a functional version both for the Linux board (firmware running our own daemon) and the Atmel MCU. All basic features are implemented (Measurements/Sending/Receiving) and some automations, but more advanced stuff still needs to be added and tweaked.
Web & Mobile Dashboard: We will need to re-design a dashboard from scratch. We only need a front-end as Cosm.com handles the backend. We'd like to design that with you by submitting wireframes gather your feedback modify it, etc.
Open Source & Collaborative Design
As members of the Maker movement we recognize the right of any customer to truly own the product he or she purchases, and to be able to modify it has he wishes. All software we wrote to run in NPlug are open source — as define by opensource.org. Though some parts, mostly written by chip manufacturers aren't.
Collaborative design might just sounds like a buzz word, but in reality it is simple. It means that we will not take your money, enclose ourself in our office and get back to you 6 months later with a product you might not want any more. Instead we will keep you updated of our progress and take your inputs in consideration. We'll have a weekly post to interact with you.
Risks and challenges
Manufacturing: We are at our 5th iteration of the design, though we still need at least one more iteration to have only our final set of components on the board. From that we'll be able to start optimizing for our manufacturing partner. Each of these step implies a risk of additional costs and delays.
Delays: We based our time frame on what each phase should take to complete, but more importantly we monitored how much time similar project have taken to be delivered. Basically we allowed us as much time as kickstarter project's 'Twine' took to ship. It's a similar project, and it ran into a lot of issues so we think we are as realist as we can get.
Certifications: We will have to meet EMC and safety standards. We anticipated these tests. Even if no one can be 100% sure that he will pass these at the first try, our electrical engineer has successfully submitted dozens of products to test labs. We'll be extra careful with suppliers especially for the enclosure which is a major risk for an AC device to transmit fire. Regarding wireless, we are using modules that have already been approved separately to minimize risks.
 
FAQs
Were you rejected from Kickstarter?
No, we didn't submit our project to Kickstarter. We are based in France and Indiegogo has a pretty good record of hosting international projects willing to collect funds in US dollars. Besides kickstarter recently excluded home improvement projects from its guidelines.
Can you ship NPlug outside of the EU or the US?
For now we are not planning to have NPlug certified for markets outside of the United States and the European Union. If you are positive that the customs of your country won't seize the package for not complying with local regulations then it is your responsibility to try. Please add an extra $15 to your pledge to cover the shipping cost.

<h2>SensySUN FEATURES AND SPECS</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>· SensySUN delivers 5 V USB output.<br/>· A Battery is included: Li-Ion2,600mAh.<br/>· The electronics can be left attached to the parasol while folded up, and can fold up with it.<br/>· Temperature and Luminosity + <b>UV exposure sensor</b><br/>· SensySUN can withstand rain. Rugged to support heat and permanent sun exposure, the electronics can stand up to 70°C (you would have left the parasol before! We're already thinking at metal tube parasols heating up a whole day in Equator!)<br/>· The design includes flexible mounting straps to allow positioning at any level inside the higher part of the parasol.<br/>· iBEACON / BLE broadcasting range and proximity: the exact maximum range depends on the environment. Bluetooth is using the same type of radio waves as 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi routers. The signal can be diffracted, interfered or absorbed by water (including the human body). Open field communication can be up to 50 meters.<br/>· Phones or other smart devices in the range can pick up the Bluetooth radio signal without previous pairing. The closer you are to the beacon, the stronger the signal is.</p>
<p>· Instruction Manual and App are included (Applications supported: IOS / Android)</p>
<p>· Dimensions:  150 * 150 * 90 mm / Weight:  Approx. 0.40 lbs. (150 g)</p>

<p><b>Among our high priorities in setting up this new business we are placing CUSTOMER SATISFACTION first.</b></p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>AN ORIGINAL CONCEPT BY IDEOVITRA</b></h2>
<p>Like most innovations the SensySUN concept started when facing the reality: we were on vacation on a beautiful beach, and <b>our smartphones went dead in the sun</b>! </p>
<p>From there we started thinking we could develop a complete solution which requires no power except from the sun: something simple, reliable, with low emission and low energy requirement, and the ability to store energy even on a cloudy day.</p>
<p><u><b>Simple but with outstanding characteristics: </b></u></p>
<p><b style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>In our vision, our device should not only load your smartphone but also offer additional services, such as ""local network announcements"" - which will serve to make people connect together in a geographical way!</b></p>
<p><b>That's why next to the CHARGER primary function we are developping the iBEACON useful apps.</b></p>

Are you like us using your smartphone on the beach, at the bar, or around the swimming pool?
Did you ever try to find an easy solution to load when your battery dies during the day? 

We haven't, and we thought it is time to find a simple solution...


SensySUN 





Stay POWERED in any outdoor situation !

SOLAR-LOAD your smartphone with SensySUN
Enjoy the summer with no worry about your battery capacity, 
all your mobile devices can be loaded.

BE CONNECTED 
with the local community around your PARASOL!
Emails and social media will never replace REAL contacts

SHARE with the local community at the bar, swimming pool or at the beach, and make friends where you are physically present!





Take the best of the summer with the clean - renewable energy from the sun ! and make friends !




With SensySUN you can be informed under the parasol about temperature, UV level, next volley-ball tournament on the local beach.

SensySUN can alert the smartphones around you if someone is stealing your smartphone or disconnects it while you are bathing,
You may order a drink at the bar, get connected with the local community around the swimming pool
And of course, load your smartphone or tablet as its primary function is a 
SOLAR CHARGER!






   



THE INSPIRATION 

Modern smartphones work everywhere, and we use them everywhere, but the battery gets a real challenge every day!
In the summer we like to go outside for hours, and we have to find charging facilities at unexpected places like a bar, a swimming pool. 
We don't necessarily carry the charger constantly with us whereas logically certain environments are not compatible with plugs!



SensySUN for parasol will bring you the solution: now on any beach, bar or swimming pool parasol you can charge a phone, or USB-compatible device, with the FREE POWER of the sun.






SensySUN BRINGS YOU FREE POWER UNDER THE PARASOL





· You can plug any make of smartphone, tablet, and seamlessly load your battery while sunbathing !


SensySUN keeps an eye on your device. 

An alarm bells if anyone disconnects it from the charger.


· In option (if they agree) you can forward this alarm to the connected neighbor’s.

Small and efficient:
· Small pyramided device.
· Made up of a 3 face solar sensor components.
· Can load any kind of smartphone within a couple of hours.

Flexible Mounting:
· Ideally designed to be placed on top of the parasol.
· Or  stand-alone device,with reasonable sunlight exposure. 




WHERE CAN I USE SENSYSUN?

SensySUN can be installed everywhere. 
Its original design fits ideal to parasols, but any stand-alone placement in direct sun exposure is sufficient.
You can use SensySUN at home, in the camping, during your vacation and week ends. Its primary function as a SOLAR CHARGER will be of great help everyday, 
You make (small) economies but most importantly you demonstrate that you 
care for the environment!




A hotel, a bar, a camping place, a tennis club... multiple organizations will have an interest for SensySUN. For instance hoteliers and bar managers will have a way to prove they are great in service and want to offer you a new experience with the communication possibilities (see iBEACON proximity communication properties below).
Owners of public places can rent it for a minimal daily fee and provide some independence to their guests!

SensySUN will offer you a great service, EVERYWHEREand this FOR FREE!








Our solution is so advanced that hoteliers and bars will like to share information with you – hence giving you a good reason to 


stay longer and enjoy the moment! 
·  Loading time is quick but you can enjoy another drink, some food, you can
RELAX because you stay connected!
·  And look at light how fascinating the slight glow of our 
Night LEDs will warm up the atmosphere!











SensySUN DOES MUCH MORE THAN LOADING: IT COMMUNICATES!










SensySUN embeds iBEACON (Bluetooth Low Energy) Technology for proximity communication purposes. 
Android devices with Bluetooth 4.0 such as the Galaxy S3 and higher, Optimus G and higher along with the iPhone 4S and higher versions can use BLE functions. Moreover other smart devices like smart watches and Google Glass can too.
This functionnality can be particularly interesting for Hoteliers, Bar Managers, public places or tennis clubs for instance: 


A free App is automatically offered in free download, immediately allowing your smartphone to relay several levels of information (such as temperature, estimated loading time, position).


Your smartphone or tablets can seamlessly communicate with a service to extend its functionalities in receiving text messages, ads, or alerts.





SensySUN brings you IN TIME communication with the restricted network of your visitors - speaking for maximum interactivity with your customers - it creates « community sharing » because it is USEFUL and GREEN.


In addition SensySUN can report temperature, luminosity and measure U.V. levels: you can easily send warnings to your customers in case of high sun exposure risk level (you may for instance recommend higher cream protection in case of maximum UV level).

                                             



3 LEVELS OF PUSH INFORMATION TO SHARE WITH YOUR COMMUNITY:










Level 1 -  Security / examples: ""Greg 6 years (blue eyes) was lost near the baby pool about 5 minutes ago"" or ""Warning / strong wind»
Level 2 - Owner Promotion / examples: ""Happy Hour on Beach Bar - place your orders now"" or ""I'd like to order 1 beer and 2 coke please""... If you order a beer, the waiter can locate you quite easily and bring your beer really CHILLED!
Level 3 - User messages examples: ""Water Polo in Main Pool at 11:15 - Meeting in 10 minutes at Beach Bar.""
It could also support commercial Information - example:
""Free dinner today for the first 2 who come and show this message at the Pool Bar""

                
You can also give a name to your parasol,  so that your friends can find you easily on the beach!







SensySUN FEATURES AND SPECS

WHY DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT?


We think
SensySUN is a fantastic product range with huge potential and you can make it happen with us !
As you
understand, our project has not yet started: we have made several prototypes
and a pre-engineering study, and only further investments can CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE SensySUN a FULLY OPERATIONAL
DEVICE. 
SensySUN is facing costs like injection mold
tooling (for future devices) and finalizing electronics and the
application software, before we can start shipping to all countries. In
order to guarantee delivery of the first devices in the next three months,
and to meet all the technical and production challenges, we require a
minimum of  $ 35,000.

For this project we've decided to make it VERY SIMPLE:
SUPPORTER AND FRIEND: ""I believe in the idea and I support the team with $ 1,-""
SPONSOR: ""I like this idea and I contribute with $ 10,-""
EARLY SENSYSUN USER: ""I NEED one and I PURCHASE one SensySUN (or more) at the unit discounted price of $ 49,- (Early Bird Rate!) - plus shipment cost.""


Also we have decided to go for a ""fixed"" target: 

Should we not meet our goal amount, everyone shall be reimbursed. You are TAKING ABSOLUTELY NO RISK!



WHAT YOU GET IN RETURN
We are releasing the products at discounted prices for early birds. 
Retail prices will be higher after the crowdfunding campaign.

This project is very simple : we are not offering multiple perks because this device is very simple. Colours will be dark-brown or black - we shall inform during the campaign if other colours can be offered (depending on you!).
If we don’t meet our goal we won't deliver the perks and reimburse. 
But we chose $35K (about 700 units) as our goal because we think that’s the minimum number of SensySUN modules we need to manufacture in order to launch the product in a timely manner and prove that our manufacturing quality is excellent.
WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU!







CHALLENGES AND RISKS - OUR ROADMAP
Production could start in the summer, as we are currently testing several prototypes in a real sunny environment. 
This period is ideal for you as a backer - if you support us we are making sure thet SensySUN turns into reality very soon.
We are confident we can implement the technology and our ability to make a nice device as we have already demonstrated with SensyBEE products

Should SensySUN meet its $ 35,000 funding goal we have everything in place to ship by October / November this year.

AN ORIGINAL CONCEPT BY IDEOVITRA
Like most innovations the SensySUN concept started when facing the reality: we were on vacation on a beautiful beach, and our smartphones went dead in the sun! 
From there we started thinking we could develop a complete solution which requires no power except from the sun: something simple, reliable, with low emission and low energy requirement, and the ability to store energy even on a cloudy day.
Simple but with outstanding characteristics: 
In our vision, our device should not only load your smartphone but also offer additional services, such as ""local network announcements"" - which will serve to make people connect together in a geographical way!
That's why next to the CHARGER primary function we are developping the iBEACON useful apps.

Faites vous partie comme nous des personnes qui emportent leur smartphone ou leur tablette partout, même à la plage ou à la piscine ?
Avez vous déjà cherché à recharger facilement vos appareils au cours d'une journée à l'extérieur ?
Nous n'y sommes par parvenus, et nous avons donc pensé à une solution simple...



SensySUN 


Profitez d'une énergie GRATUITE

RECHARGEZ votre smartphone avec SensySUN 
Profitez sans souci de l'été et gardez votre batterie à pleine capacité, tous vos appareils mobiles peuvent être rechargés gratuitement

Recevez des informations locales

Communiquez avec les personnes autour de votre PARASOL
Les emails et les réseaux sociaux ne remplacent pas les vrais contacts avec les personnes qui nous entourent.Une communauté ""physique"" vous entoure, faites vous des amis !

SensySUN inaugure une nouvelle forme d’interactivité avec les personnes PHYSIQUEMENT présentes sur votre lieu de détente :

Avec SensySUN vous pouvez être informés sous le parasol, la température, le niveau d'exposition aux U.V., le prochain tournoi de volley-ball sur la page  : ne manquez rien !
SensySUN prévient automatiquement les personnes autour de vous si quelqu'un cherche à dérober votre appareil, ou le déconnecte pendant que vous vous baignez,
Vous pouvez commander une boisson sans vous déplacer, ou vous connecter socialement aux personnes qui sont présentes au même moment dans un rayon proche autour de la piscine... 
Et bien sûr, chargez votre smartphone ou tablette à votre convenance car la fonction principale de SensySUN est celle de CHARGEUR SOLAIRE.



NOTRE INSPIRATION 

Les derniers smartphones fonctionnent partout, et nous accompagnent toute la journée, mais la batterie relève un défi chaque jour!
L'été nous passons des heures à l’extérieur, et nous sommes souvent amenés à trouver le moyen de recharger nos appareils dans des lieux souvent incompatibles avec l'électricité, comme le bar de la piscine, ou la plage.


SensySUN est une solution simple : à présent sous un parasol vous pouvez charger un téléphone ou tout appareil compatible en liaison USB, avec l'énergie gratuite du soleil.


SensySUN vous apporte l'ENERGIE GRATUITE ET UTILE SOUS LE PARASOL


Branchez simplement votre smartphone, tablette, et bronzez 
ou allez vous baigner !

SensySUN recharge et surveille !Une alarme se manifeste si quelqu'un déconnecte votre téléphone du module de charge.
En option, s'ils l'ont accepté, vos voisins connectés autour de vous seront avertis et pourront vous prévenir immédiatement.

Petit et efficace :
· design pyramidal très épuré pour s'adapter à tout environnement.
· 3 composants solaires pour une bonne capacité de charge, sans besoin d'orientation compliquée

· permet de recharger un smartphone en 2-3 heures, même en l'absence de soleil car SensySUN contient une batterie intégrée qui stocke l'énergie.
Montage facile :
· idéalement SensySUN est placé en haut d'un parasol, bien exposé mais discret.
· Ou alors se pose simplement sur une table, un bar, avec une exposition correcte au soleil.
OU PUIS-JE UTILISER SENSYSUN?

SensySUN s'installe partout. 
Le design original est prévu pour coiffer un parasol, mais tout emplacement libre avec une exposition directe au soleil est parfait.
Vous pouvez utiliser SensySUN à la maison, dans le jardin, au camping, pendant les vacances et le WE. 

Ce CHARGEUR SOLAIRE vous rendra service chaque jour.
Vous ferez une petite économie sur l'électricité en montrant surtout que vous vous souciez de l'environnement!


Les hôteliers, bars, campings ou tennis clubs... De multiples organisations pourront utiliser. Par exemple pour démontrer qu'ils offent un service excellent, en proposant une expérience innovante en termes d'interactivité avec leurs clients (voir plus bas notre façon très innovante de développer la communication en protocole iBEACON).
Plus généralement les propriétaires ou exploitants de lieux d'accueil du public pourront louer le service SensySUN pour une somme très modeste, et offrir
 une nouvelle forme d'indépendance à leurs clients ou visiteurs!


SensySUN vous rend un grand service, PARTOUT
et GRATUITEMENT !



Notre proposition est si originale que les hôteliers et gérants de bars voudront partager plus d'information avec vous, tout en vous donnant un bon prétexte pour : 
Rester plus longtemps et profiter mieux de l'instant ! 

·  Rechargez un téléphone, c'est rapide, mais vous pouvez prendre le temps pour commander une autre boisson, une collation, tranquillement,

Vous RELAXER parce que vous ne tombez plus en panne de batterie !

·  Et regardez comme le scintillement de nos LEDS réchauffe l'atmosphère la nuit!
 



SensySUN FAIT PLUS QUE CHARGER : IL COMMUNIQUE !

SensySUN embarque la technologie iBEACON (Bluetooth Low Energy) à des fins de communication interactive de proximité. 
Tous les appareils Android avec Bluetooth 4.0 comme le Samsung Galaxy S3 et suivants, Optimus G et suivants, les générations à partir de iPhone 4S embarquent les technologies (Bluetooth Low Energy). De nombreux appareils ""smart"" comme les montres ou les Google Glass le peuvent aussi.

Cette fonctionnalité est particulièrement intéressante pour les gérants de lieux accueillant le public, hôtels, bars, tennis clubs ou campings par exemple : 


Une application gratuite est automatiquement suggérée en téléchargement, permettant à votre appareil connecté de relayer différents niveaux d'informations (comme la température, le niveau d'UV instantané, le lieu de votre séjour ou d'accueil).
Votre smartphone ou tablette peuvent ainsi communiquer avec le service de l'hôte (en local, sans coût d'opérateur) et étendre ses capacités de communication par la réception de messages, promotions ou alertes qui ne concernent QUE LE LIEU OU VOUS VOUS TROUVEZ.



VOUS NE MANQUEZ RIEN de la communauté ou des services qui vous environnement.




SensySUN vous apporte :

- la communication EN TEMPS REEL avec le réseau exclusif de vos visiteurs
- vous offre une interractivité INSTANTANEE et LOCALE avec vos clients 
- tout en étant utile (donc ACCEPTE) et positif pour l'ENVIRONNEMENT !

                              

3 NIVEAUX D'INFORMATION POSSIBLES AVEC VOTRE COMMUNAUTE :




Niveau 1 - Sécurité exemples: ""Greg 6 ans (yeux bleus) a disparu il y a 5 minutes, aidez nous à le retrouver!"" ou alors ""vent fort, baignade dangereuse"" ;
 Niveau 2 - Promotion locale exemples: ""Happy Hour au Bar - placez maintenant vos commandes"" ou alors ""La soirée dansante aura lieu ce soir au bord de la piscine"" ;
Niveau 3 - Messages d'utilisateurs / exemples: ""Water Polo à la piscine à 11:15 - inscrivez vous au Bar."" ou ""qui veut jouer à la pétanque vers 17 heures"".
SensySUN vous apporte une interactivité en local avec une grande simplicité.

               

Vous pouvez aussi donner un nom à votre parasol pour que vos amis vous trouvent facilement sur la plage !

POURQUOI DEMANDONS NOUS VOTRE SOUTIEN ?
Nous pensons que SensySUN est un concept très utile avec un gros potentiel de développement, et vous pouvez nous aider à concrétiser le lancement commercial en devenant nos premiers clients ! 
Comme vous le comprenez, notre projet est au stade de l'étude et de pré-validation. Il fonctionne (nous l'avons testé en extérieur, en situation réelle). Nous avons plusieurs prototypes fonctionnels qui donnent satisfaction.
A ce stade nous devons prendre la décision d'investir pour que SensySUN arrive sur le marché. Pour finaliser les moules, outillages et cartes électroniques, créer les applications informatiques nous espérons réunir un financement de 35,000 Dollars.

Pour ce projet nous avons une approche très simple dans les niveaux de financement demandés :

SUPPORTER et AMI : ""j'aime l'idée, et je soutiens l'équipe avec ma contribution symbolique de 1 $""
SPONSOR: ""je veux donner sa chance au projet, et j'investis 10 $ qui seront déduits de mon éventuelle première commande lorsque le produit sera lancé""
PREMIER UTILISATEUR SENSYSUN : ""j'en veux un et je profite de l'occasion pour bénéficier du prix de lancement de  49 $ (plus frais de port selon ma région ou pays).""

Nous avons aussi décidé de partir sur une financement FIXE :
Si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif dans son intégralité, chacun est remboursé :
VOUS NE PRENEZ AUCUN RISQUE !


NOS CONTREPARTIES POUR VOUS REMERCIER
Notre produit est proposé à un prix spécial de lancement.Les prix de vente seront supérieurs par la suite.



Nous simplifions au maximum la gestion du projet : nous cherchons à lancer un produit unique, dans la couleur marron ou noir, assez neutre pour convenir partout, et nous vous tiendrons informés régulièrement au cours de la campagne de crowdfunding si des couleurs supplémentaires sont demandées et possibles.
Notre objectif de 35,000 Dollars correspond à environ 700 modules. C'est une quantité minimale à produire pour valider et démontrer le sérieux de nos fabrications, et bien sûr 
POUR VOUS LIVRER DANS LES MEILLEURS DÉLAIS UN PRODUIT ABOUTI
NOUS COMPTONS SUR VOUS !





CHALLENGES ET RISQUES - 
NOS ETAPES POUR REUSSIR
La production pourrait démarrer juste à la fin de la campagne, à la fin de l'été. Nous en profitons d'ici là pour tester une maximum de prototypes durant les mois ensoleillés.
Pour vous en tant que contributeur c'est l'assurance que le produit soit efficace.
Nous sommes confiants car les premiers essais sont positifs, et nous avons acquis de l'expérience en lançant les modules de gestion énergétique SensyBEE.
Si nous atteignons l'objectif de 35,000 Dollars, nous pensons pouvoir livrer courant Octobre-Novembre de cette année, et vous pourrez faire un cadeau original à Noël en offrant un produit d'été pratique et écologique !

Hi, we are Filowz. Thank you for your interest in our project.We love music, and many of us use smartphones as a source of music. We always have our smartphones with us, wherever we are. But how do we share the music we love?The Sonomad is a Hi-Fi wireless portable sound system which lets you enjoy and share your music anywhere, anytime with an unmatched combination of performance and portability.
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE SONOMAD?
The Sonomad is:

a stereo high-end audio quality speaker
20 hours of nonstop music playing on battery
an astonishing powerful acoustic output
an extremely user friendly wire free stereo system
a unique safe dock compatible with any smartphone
designed and made in France




EXTRA PORTABLE PERFORMANCE

Hi-Fi sound quality, huge power and long lasting battery life: the high quality internal components and materials of the Sonomad make it the best sounding and most powerful sound system of its class. And combined with its high capacity optimized battery, the entertainment will go on for hours.





HIGH END DESIGN AND AMAZING ERGONOMICS
The Sonomad is a unique piece of industrial design. Thought and built to be as strong as possible, the Sonomad is truly portable and really convenient to use, thanks to its compact form and its carrying functions (handle and shoulder strap). And if you do not want to carry it, you can easily throw it in your backpack. 
The Sonomad is compatible with any smartphone, computer, tablet, mp3 player…wirelessly connected through Bluetooth, or with a wire via the standard stereo input.
The safe dock is compatible with any smartphone which is less than 3 in (76 mm) wide and 6.2 in (160 mm) high. Let's say that almost all smartphones will fit nicely inside the Sonomad.





GREAT FEATURES
Designed in Paris, the Sonomad brings the 70's back with the latest and best technology of the 21th century. Carry it with the retractable handle or with the included shoulder strap and you are ready to be on the move…musically!
Connect to the Sonomad through Bluetooth and control the speaker from up to 30 feet (10 meters). And if you do not have Bluetooth or just are too far away from the speaker, simply use the standard audio connector.
Recharge your smartphone or your mp3 player through the included USB connector (5V). Since your smartphone battery will probably be empty a long time before the Sonomad gets a low battery, let's share energy and keep the music going!
Connect several Sonomad units together through the audio output to get a bigger, wilder sound. Connect a smartphone to a Sonomad, and just plug in as many Sonomad units as you want!





THE SAFE DOCK
The Sonomad is the only speaker including the universal mount which can protect your smartphone. 
Insert your smartphone between the grisps.



Turn around the trap.

Use it as a dock at home and as soon as you are on the move or doing outdoor activities, your smartphone is safe. Just need one hand…and your smartphone will not fear water, sand or any accidental fall.

<p>Keyapp is an encryption service for messages in any environment, our objective is to return the privacy of users all over internet, Keyapp believe that privacy should be more than a right, an obligation to provide it through the platforms, but these, governments and companies have made this a business.<br/></p>
<p>In keyapp we don't limit ourselves to encrypt only your emails, we cover all applications used daily in our devices, WhatsApp, Messenger, Line, Telegram, Skype, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, SMS and any web page, actually any platform that has a text box, Keyapp encrypted it.<br/></p>
<p>In Keyapp we are committed to privacy seriously, we can not decrypt any message, even if a government requires us, this is because the information goes through us in encrypted form and is simply impossible.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Military technology</h3>
<div>Keyapp uses military technology to encrypt messages in Keyapp use its latest version which is AES-256 bits, why we say it is impossible to decrypt without the key ?, because it would take <b>billions</b> years to decrypt a message encrypted in AES-256 hard crude and currently most powerful computer, and use RSA / 2048/4096 to share personal keys, all this works locally on your device.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Keyapp uses two encryption algorithms RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm or public key and AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, these algorithms are the basis of our service.</p>
<p>RSA works as a lock with two entrances, one to open and another to close, in this case the closing brace does not open, then a user can send a message and closes with the key, but this is not going to be able to open, only the recipient has the key that opens.</p>
<p>AES works as a conventional padlock that closes the same key opens, so RSA is used to share the AES key between users, since AES has no limitations to the size of text or files and is much faster.</p>
<p>In addition, each message encrypted with AES is different, so have the same content, so we avoided the cryptanalysis of messages.</p>

<p>Keyapp uses a custom keyboard very similar to each mobile additionally a button that displays a list of contacts and groups to choose to whom it is addressed the message and encrypt it for that contact or group.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>If you want to read a message simply copy the message and automatically Keyapp deployed a dialogue with the decoded message, if not an encrypted message, not shown this dialogue, if error, show by the same method.</p>

<h3>Use of funds</h3>
<p>Thanks to the funds raised in this campaign we can recruit and expand our team and accelerate the development of the application for iOS and desktop (Windows, Linux, OS X), to deliver the service on all major platforms, we currently have the application Android also will use the funds raised to buy the necessary servers and provide the highest possible level of service.</p>
<p>We not only want to stay here, we have a list of objectives to fulfill and deliver more capabilities to their memberships and double its characteristics, we want to add features such as encrypted files as videos, images, documents and others, but unfortunately we have insufficient resources to carry them out simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our future goals are:</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Impact</h3>In Keyapp we hope to create an awareness, we want to teach that privacy is important to everyone, whether a message of ""Hello"" among friends, are private messages, must be respected, and now we will have control over our information.<p></p>
<p>We just want to protect among us had already become trivial to mention privacy and took for granted that businesses and governments use them, but it should not, it's time to give us our place.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>Some governments and private companies will be against our service, but if this happens is to assert our point we are giving them our information, forced some legal terms but we do not want to accept.<p></p>
<p>If we all fight together, we can overcome all these difficulties overcome.</p>

Keyapp

Keyapp es un servicio de cifrado para mensajes en cualquier entorno, nuestro objetivos es regresar la privacidad de los usuarios de todo internet, en Keyapp creemos que la privacidad debe ser mas que un derecho, una obligación suministrarla por las plataformas, pero estas, gobiernos y las empresas han hecho de esto un negocio.En Keyapp no nos limitamos a cifrar solo sus correos electrónicos, abarcamos toda las aplicaciones utilizadas diariamente en nuestro dispositivos, WhatsApp, Messenger, Line, Telegram, Skype, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, SMS y cualquier pagina web, en realidad cualquier plataforma que tenga una caja de texto Keyapp lo cifrara.
