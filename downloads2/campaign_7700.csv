<p><b>ABOUT</b></p>
<p><i>Building
a World; But Building a World for Women</i> is an installation performance art piece where patrons will be
able to explore a handcrafted paradise while taking in spoken word and movement,
based around what it means to be a woman. The visual experience will reflect the
new world that was built off the wishes of women, but the poetry and
choreography will remind you of the world we live in. This project is a tug and
pull of what a women’s world is and what it should be. </p>
<p><b>ABOUT ME</b></p>
<p>I am a recent graduate of the University of
the Arts. On May 10, 2016 I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theatre Arts.
While at the University of the Arts I majored in directing, playwriting, and
production and minored in musical theatre. I studied an array of arts both
within theatre, and outside. I took up courses in producing, stage management,
solo performance, poetry, film, dance, and acting. For a short while I studied abroad
in London and Tokyo, and I have worked and studied under local Philadelphia
award winning directors, actors, and playwrights such as Ozzie Jones, Joanna
Settle, James Ijames, and Matt Pfeiffer, etc. One of the things I
discovered about myself while at Uarts is that I love bringing art forms
together to create an almost undefinable piece. Undefinable to me doesn’t mean
without definition, it means the biggest definition you can create. It means to
create something so big and so great that the imaginative amount of space it
takes up is infinite. I discovered that I often create my strongest work when I
unite the arts in an effort to tell a story or curate an experience. By
producing my own work, I have the liberty to experiment with multiple art-forms
while creating a piece that focuses on important social issues.</p>
<p><b>PROJECT PHILOSOPHY</b></p>
<p>My intention is to create a space using pieces
that symbolize the way I view a women’s world, or what I think it should be. I
am interested in exploring what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a
women living in a man’s world, and what type of world women want to live in.
With my work I hope to ask questions like, what makes a woman, a woman? If God
gave us the power to create our own world what it be? In a day and age where
the world is constantly battling issues (and new issues arising) such as
women’s rights, social and economic equality for women, transgender rights,
cat-calling and sexual abuse, what it means to be a feminist, breastfeeding in
public, slut shaming and rape-culture, women who choose to wear make-up and
women who don’t, etc. This is a relevant and necessary piece that I not only
need to create, but that the world needs to experience.  </p>
<p><b>PROCESS</b></p>
<p>In order to create this world, I will interview
one-hundred-and-one women, asking them, “What is, what could be, and what
should be a women’s world”.  I will then create a world incorporating
those answers. You will enter the space and maybe see a cloud completely made
of menstrual pads, or a river completely made of hair. While audience members
explore the space they will also take in original poetry and choreography that
explores what it means to be a woman, and what a women’s world is, and what it
should/could be.</p>
<p><b>WHY $3,000?</b></p>
<p>My campaign goal of $3,000 allows me to pay
the hard working artists included in this project, purchase craft and special
effect materials, pay for necessary advertising/ marketing, as well as cover
rental costs. </p>
<p><b>GET INVOLVED</b></p>
<p>By donating a minimum of $5.00 you can
have your voice and vision be a part of this new world. We will send you a survey
asking you what should be in this new world? What do you want to see? What do
you want to hear? What do you want to experience? When you come to this world
you may just see your wish come true. If you donate $10 a personalized Haiku
will be sent to you revealing a secret about the world or the process. The more
you give, the more you get. Check out the cool perks that we have!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting involved in a
different way I am always looking for more women to interview. You can schedule
an appointment to be interviewed at <a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.buildingaworld@gmail.com</span></a>. </p>
<p><b>We are also always looking for craft

<h3><strong>LoveReigns who?</strong></h3>
<p>I have performed professionally in Jacksonville, FL and throughout the country for 6 years and through that experience, I have developed a unique love and passion for the arts...not just poetry, all art. Almost 2 years ago, I approached my friend and graphic designer, Benjamin Dodd with an idea. In my head, I saw the vision but had no idea how it would come to pass. I drew a picture on a sticky note and handed it to him. What he birthed from that stickey note became the logo and ultimately the beginning of Artis(Tree)...where love, music, poetry and art reside. I wanted to create a space where artists from all backgrounds could come together and share in the beauty of creativity. Creating, performing, and experiencing it's unpredicatable sight. A feat that seemed to be simplistically complicated at first, but what has happened with Artis(Tree), going on now for almost 2 years, is nothing short of amazing. The infusion of live art, poetry, comedy, music, instrumental, beat boxing, reggae, hip-hop, spoken word, dance and so so much more has made Artis(Tree) Live what it is today and will continue to be.</p>
<p>The very first performer to ever grace an Artis(Tree) stage goes by the name of Goliath Flores (<a href=""http://www.goliathflores.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.goliathflores.com</a>), a ridiculously talented multi-instrumentalist who sang, played an acoustic guitar and tambourines to open up the show. Everyone who was there was left stunned in amazement because during the performance, we also heard a trumpet. We came to realize the trumpet sound we heard was coming from Goliath's mouth, yet it sounded like a real trumpet. I knew then that Artis(Tree) would BE the vision it was intended to be.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why we need you</h3>
<p>Here are our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate-We are at a point where we are ready to share our experiences with the world. Eventually Artis(Tree) Live will not only be the ultimate live creative entertainment experience, we will also become a platform for dreamers to become visionaries.</li>
<li>Diversify-Currently Artis(Tree) Live is based in Jacksonville, FL. We have in the works, opportunities to expand beyond Jacksonville.</li>
<li>Give back-In a short time we have been able to donate not only monetarily to local organizations but also by donating our time. We want to do more. We want to give more. Our growth will allow us to be able to help on a larger scale. The very root of our existence is community service.</li>
<li>Website-We need to raise a decent amount to be able to develop a professional website and hire a webmaster.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact: Why is this project important???</h3>
As an artist, I have been taken advantage of, overlooked, forgotten, undermined, stolen from, lied to, mislead, judged...etc. With Artis(Tree) I have been able to create a stage that has allowed me to no longer have to beg to be heard. I wanted to extend that same courtesy and opportunity to others. Artis(Tree) is a stage where all are welcome and all are on a level playing field. Artis(Tree) isn't about LoveReigns, it is simply about giving a voice to the voiceless.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Can't help monetarily? If you can, please spread the word about this campaign and about Artis(Tree) in general to everyone you know and tell them that it will be headed their way SOON!!!!!</div>

Website-We need to raise a decent amount to be able to develop a professional website and hire a webmaster.



The Impact: Why is this project important???
As an artist, I have been taken advantage of, overlooked, forgotten, undermined, stolen from, lied to, mislead, judged...etc. With Artis(Tree) I have been able to create a stage that has allowed me to no longer have to beg to be heard. I wanted to extend that same courtesy and opportunity to others. Artis(Tree) is a stage where all are welcome and all are on a level playing field. Artis(Tree) isn't about LoveReigns, it is simply about giving a voice to the voiceless.

Other Ways You Can Help
Can't help monetarily? If you can, please spread the word about this campaign and about Artis(Tree) in general to everyone you know and tell them that it will be headed their way SOON!!!!!

<p><strong>What the w$#% is Fornicated?</strong></p>
<p>You know how hearing llve music events can make you feel something indescribable?</p>
<p>You know when you want to ask the characters on your favorites series what they're doing next?</p>
<p>You know how the technology in your hand can feel both powerful and overwhelming?  </p>
<p>So do we.</p>
<p>Fornicated links these seemingly disparate feelings. Fornicated starts on your phone, leads you to a theatrical music festival, and takes you beyond with a new community-building app.</p>
<p><em>We are building a NEW theater. A digital stage. We need your donations to build out the technology.</em>   We have been training invisible performers.  Actors who perform incredibly specific work through a computer and through a texting platform we've built. We have developed the storytelling that leads audience from these interactions to live experiences. The digital stage is not where it ends.  Its where it begins.</p>
<p>Fornicated is an immersive digital and live show.  Its a social-media concept album. Its a nuanced miniseries of music fans that you're inside of.  Its a multi-media marketing campaign. Its a unique web of stories woven through a live music festival.</p>
<p>Fornicated is the dancing sweat of a rock audience, the jolt of adrenaline a text from <em>that</em> person shocks you with, and the held breath of a life-changing theatrical moment. </p>
<p>Its about the power of live experience amidst a world filled with technology. </p>
<p><strong>How do I experience this crazy thing?</strong></p>
<p>Right? This is precisely what brings you and us together here on Indiegogo.  </p>
<p>We're a group of New York based artists and producers who have worked in theater, film, and music.  <em>You </em>are someone who we hope to introduce to Fornicated (wherever you are), but for that we need your help.  We want to be in your city.  On your phone.  And at the concerts of your favorite bands.  </p>
<p>We started building the live portion in 2009 to re-imagine the traditional idea of a live rock show. Then we added text messages to your phone. Then we birthed characters living online. And then it exploded. We found ourselves crafting the Livecode that can bring audiences from a digital story to a live music experience.  We've built technologies from scratch.  We've explored the nuances of digital characters becoming live. It has become a whole new extraordinary ballgame.  </p>
<p>However, with each development of Fornicated our audience has exceeded the scale of our technology. So now we have a mission. We want to bring you from your phone to a pulsating-live and ultimately, sustainable community - what we're calling, ""a beat."" A beat contains the shared experience of a community and band forged through a final concert.  A beat you can continue to connect to through our app.</p>
<p>This is a platform that could truly link live music and technology into a movement.</p>
<p><strong>So why indiegogo? Why now?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Great question! (We are totally on the same wavelength.)  The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council has given us a residency to incubate Fornicated. They too believe that we are on to something.  Our next step involves traveling across the country to research the organizational components of music festivals, meet with technology developers in Silicon Valley to design an app, and put together our own research week in New York City in which we bring specialists in the music, technology, and producing industries to consult with.</p>
<p class=""p1""><em>This is when we need your help</em>. To make this critical development stage possible.  Company start-up fees, organizational materials, and technology development, add up and we need to take this first step to bring Fornicated larger funding and resources in our next phase.  Your $1 can become $1000 for us tomorrow.  $50 for a tank of gas will power us toward the future of this endevour.  Or even go towards a few hours of programming our cutting edge technology. Think what $100 could do...</p>

<h3>Hello everyone!</h3>
<p>I started playing with clay about a year ago, and in time this hobby sort of grew into me...and I got better. I mostly make fan-art or just custom things people would like to have. Handmade crafts. A lot of people like it and have shown interest in it.</p>
<p>I enjoy what I'm doing, but it's not that cheap. Thus I'd like to show my creations to a wider audience. For that I'd need a web page which i don't know how to make myself. I'd also need to get better tools to work with.</p>
<p>By helping me, you will enable me to get more interest for my accessories/figurines worldwide, and help me make things with better quality.</p>
<p>You can see more of my creations here:</p>

<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>Why I'm here</h3>
<p>So far I was working with toothpicks, so tools would cost me around 30€;</p>
<p>I'd like to set up a web page, for which costs can vary from 300-500€;</p>
<p>Lastly I'd need my own oven to bake my creations (since I moved out, I've been baking at friends place xD), which would be around 150-200€</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal I'll buy stuff that I can afford with what I'll get - even if I'll only be able to buy new tools, it's very appreciated :)</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My creations are handmade and can be greatly customisable. By contributing, you can get a custom made pendant, set of earrings or even a bigger figurine. The world itself will just get to know another indie artist ^^</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated, and I hope you will spread the word about my campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>

Eyedea is a project of Hans Emanuel, who brings together a Los Angeles collective of fiction, fashion,
graphic, and music artists. From the Box Eight Studio in downtown Los Angeles,
we begin our journey with our first fashion art video project: The
Black Trilogy. Beyond being a vehicle to explore our different artistic
loves, we hope to showcase the natural link between them. Crushing the lines
between fiction, fashion, and film is something only possible in fantastic
LA—and the result is magic. This is our firm belief. 
This project brings together two ambitious artists: cinematographer Chayse Irvin. Chayse is and up-and-coming DP whose growing list of credits is a testament to his drive.  Director Hans Emanuel
is a director and editor who brings his own excitement and desire. www.hansemanuel.com
 
The Vision: THE BLACK TRILOGY
For our first piece, we are exploring a relationship between
dark and light, discovering small secret moments of a woman and man. Inspired
by the boldest and most inspired fashion photography, we will utilize slow
seductive movements that allow us to wash in the beauty of the clothes,
make-up, hair, and lighting.
 
The video starts black. With each reverberating
click of a camera, a light flash illuminates the scene. We discover the actions
of the protagonist to the rhythm of flashes that light up and accelerate as if
it were the paparazzi. These moments are stolen ones, each microsecond of
illumination defeating blackness for only that moment. Does the woman desire black solitude or does she embrace the voyeuristic thrill of the flashes? The shadows are helpless
to our inescapable draw to her captured beauty. We want more. We,
the camera, become a character, voyaging to discover more.
 
The Impact: SPREADING OUR VISION
We look forward to bringing our art to the far corners of the
earth. The desire to share our art is a primary one. Many of our members were
born or raised abroad. We are extremely excited by the wide variety of
welcoming hands which will receive our work, displaying it in their
exhibitions, galleries, and festivals.
The root of the inspiration for the film, though, is
indefinable LA. We look forward to spreading our work in LA in order to spread

What do we need to make this a reality?We

This project has been started by Shane West and Steve Schack from North Pole, Alaska. We are both currently serving in the U.S. Army. We will be flying to Barrow, Alaska in about two weeks, 28-29 August to do the Polar Bear Plunge in the Arctic Ocean. Barrow is the northern most city in the United States and has the Arctic Ocean as its back yard. The average temp. in Barrow during the summer is only 40 degrees, so you can imagine how cold the water must be. We are trying to raise some money via donation to do this. All proceeds that we make will be donated to the Wounded Warrior Project. The Wounded Warrior Project is a foundation that was established to help military service members who have been wounded in combat, while serving our country and protecting our freedom. We have paid our way up there using frequent flyer miles and no money will be kept for ourselves. I only sent this to a few of you, but if you can pass this on, we would be greatly appreciative! We are not asking for certain amounts or any money at all; we just wanted to get the word out, so if you want to help, it will be going to a great cause. Thanks for your time!

I truly enjoy giving back by devoting my time and resources to organizing community art projects. Whether creating art fundraisers for non-profit organizations, organizing art auctions, scheduling artist workshops, organizing artist retreats, or curating community exhibitions... Art projects keep culture alive. Many of my past art projects like the "" MSU Artist Lecture Series"", Artists 2 Africa"", ""Baltimore's Unsung"", ""Con10poraries"", ""Creative Quarantine"", and various other art projects where organized and funded with community support and like minded partners. As we have experienced, more and more of the Arts are being impacked by budget cuts, are either unfunded or simply being shut-down all together. We all have do our part to keep arts in the forefront of our culture and community.  I'm able and willing to offer some of my personal art collections at dealer discounts to further this mission. My focus is to educate and connect through ART.

<p>I am a movement artist, writer, photography dabbler, and alternative carpenter who travels in an 8'x24' mobile, performance dwelling. I move from town to town, create work and perform, while providing a platform for people of diverse skills, passions, and interests. The mobile stage, which transforms from an insular, compact design to an open, public venue, offers a free space for community members to hold discussions, brainstorming sessions, workshops, rehearsals, and/or performances. Each community event is as diverse as the participants. This could look like: someone talking about local organic farming, followed by a mime workshop, followed by a movement study, followed by a discussion on blacksmithing. </p>
<p>To date Raw Art Tour has performed, organized events, and/or led residencies in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urbana, Illinois (August 2011)</li>

</ul><p>Raw Art Tour will be organizing an event at Vandenberg Plaze for ArtPrize September 19 - October 7, in partnership with ADORATION.</p>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Immediate Goal  </h3>
<p>My immediate fundraising goal of $1,500 will help offset the costs of organizing, marketing/promoting, stage managing, crew work and performing. It will also be used to provide gas while traveling. Once I raise $1,000 from individual sources, I will also be able to apply for grants and fellowships through my fiscal sponsor, which is very exciting! </p>
<p>If you donate to this project, you get gifts! like:</p>

<li>handmade postcards</li>
<li>handmade magnets </li>
<li>poetry books</li>
<li>personalized surprise! gifts</li>
<li>opportunity to rent the stage for an afternoon or evening</li>
<li>a special performance for you, your loved ones, or the charity of your choice</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why This Is Important</h3>
<p>I work incredibly hard to do what I do because I believe it is important work. This is a full time endeavor that I have been financing alone because I believe in the power of open space, artistic exchange, and low-key, no-pressure learning environments. I invite and incite community members to hone their skills, share their insights, and connect with neighbors. These events draw in activists, spiritual communities, tradeswomen, performers, and folks of all kinds who come together and share experiences, dreams, and stories. Almost all of these events are free and open to the public and participants do not pay to use the stage; I believe in free access for everyone. </p>
<p>Community support from people like you bolsters the success of each event, and furthers Raw Art’s mission. You have the power to connect communities by providing space and time for learning and exchange. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Do you write music? Do you play music? Do you want to look like you are a groovy musician when you're hanging out in a coffee shop? </p>
<p>Then YOU need one of these notebooks! </p>
<p>I was always looking for the perfect staff paper notebook and never finding it. They are all too big or oddly shaped or heavy... So I designed my own. It's simple, but very functional. It fits in my bag and it's light and coil-bound for easy use on a music stand or desk. I love these books! They are very, very, very, handy... </p>
<p>Originally, my plan was to have 1000 made and distribute them until they were gone, but then I wouldn't have any more! </p>
<p>The Perfect Staff Paper Notebooks are 50 pages 8-1/5"" x 5-1/5"" with a coil binding. </p>
<p>So, now, my plan is to start my own little tiny publishing company that specializes in these particularly perfect notebooks.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Composer, pianist, vocalist, educator, and pilot, <a href=""http://www.katekohler.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kate Kohler</a> is an advocate of fearlessness and music. She is an active composer, performer and recording artist. Before she moved to LA from Montana she composed a series of 3 New Age piano CD’s for her acupuncturist called <a href=""http://www.pianomusicfor.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lullabies for Grownups</a>.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need the equipment and supplies to produce these books by hand. </p>
<p>Equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A commerical copy Machine</li>
<li>A commercial paper cutter</li>
<li>A coil binding machine which includes a multi-hole punch</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplies: Paper!</p>
<ul>
<li>White, recycled 20 pound sheets for the inside</li>
<li>Many colors of card stock for the covers</li>
</ul>
<p>My current budget looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 - Copy Machine</li>
<li>$500 - Paper Cutter</li>
<li>$500 - Coil Binding Hole Punch </li>
<li>$500 - Paper Supplies</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Do you write music? Do you play music? Do you want to look like you are a groovy musician when you're hanging out in a coffee shop? 
Then YOU need one of these notebooks! 
I was always looking for the perfect staff paper notebook and never finding it. They are all too big or oddly shaped or heavy... So I designed my own. It's simple, but very functional. It fits in my bag and it's light and coil-bound for easy use on a music stand or desk. I love these books! They are very, very, very, handy... 
Originally, my plan was to have 1000 made and distribute them until they were gone, but then I wouldn't have any more! 
The Perfect Staff Paper Notebooks are 50 pages 8-1/5"" x 5-1/5"" with a coil binding. 
So, now, my plan is to start my own little tiny publishing company that specializes in these particularly perfect notebooks.  
Composer, pianist, vocalist, educator, and pilot, Kate Kohler is an advocate of fearlessness and music. She is an active composer, performer and recording artist. Before she moved to LA from Montana she composed a series of 3 New Age piano CD’s for her acupuncturist called Lullabies for Grownups.


What We Need 
We need the equipment and supplies to produce these books by hand. 
Equipment:

A commerical copy Machine
A commercial paper cutter
A coil binding machine which includes a multi-hole punch

Supplies: Paper!

White, recycled 20 pound sheets for the inside
Many colors of card stock for the covers

My current budget looks like this:

$1000 - Copy Machine
$500 - Paper Cutter
$500 - Coil Binding Hole Punch 
$500 - Paper Supplies



The Impact
In the future:

I will provide these notebooks online and ship them all over the world. I want to be able to keep the retail price at $5 each when you buy 10 at a time. 
With this equipment, I will be able to publish other music projects for composers and musicians. Short-run publications with coil-binding, are ideal for music. My brother Rob Kohler's jazz theory book will be the second book hot off of these presses!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi!  My name is Hanna Jett King. I'm 23 years old and an artist/ violinist/ writer/ makeup artist/ filmmaker... You get the idea...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I started making leather masks around 6 months ago when I needed to make a prop for a film.  I had a lot of fun making that mask and got a lot of good feedback from it, so I decided to try my hand at making more masks!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I entered my first art exhibit in October, 2010.  I worked very hard to make the 40 pieces required in a very short amount of time.  I had a great time at the show, and once again I got a lot of great feedback and interest in the masks. <br/></p>
<p><br/>My goal is to turn this hobby into a successful business where I can make masks and sell them full time!  I need YOUR help to do this!</p>

<h3>Why I Need Your Help<br/>

<p>As much as I enjoy making masks, I don't have the money required for materials, website, marketing, etc., to make them full time.  I want to make these masks available for anyone to buy online!</p>

<div> </div>
<div>My name is Eames Demetrios and for the past 9 years I have been going around the world installing bronze plaques and historic sites that honor events from a parallel world.  That parallel universe is called <a href=""http://www.kcymaerxthaere.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kcymaerxthaere</a>--and it is the name of the artwork too.  It is like a novel with every page in a different place, and <em>where</em> you read such a page influences <em>how</em> you visualize the story you are reading about.  It sounds a bit unusual, but it is actually a whole lot of fun--for me and the people who follow it, or even those who just stumble upon it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for being unusual--I think that is what IndieGoGo is for: to connect people with beautiful and unexpected things.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Currently we are at <a href=""http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/kcymaerxthaere-and-winter-stories-take-halsey-visitors-on-an-unexpected-adventure/Content?oid=3408074"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">83 markers and sites</a> in 15 countries so far and a very important installation will be dedicated in Abilene, Texas on April 12.  It is the story of the Museum of the Bench.</div>
<div> </div>

<div>I have always enjoyed telling stories, but some time ago, I began to think: wouldn't it be cool if you could visit my stories in our physical world?  I kept imagining how that experience could work---always reflecting just how much language is a part of perception (think how vivid your favorite characters or movies or books are to you).  And then I realized no one was stopping me.  Here is one plaque being installed underwater off the coast of Scotland.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Working with a local cultural icon, <a href=""http://www.thegracemuseum.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Grace Museum</a>, and some amazing local artists, we are doing a significant installation in the small but vibrant Texas city of Abilene.  And we want to celebrate by engaging the community in the parallel world story--that this area was once the home of a vast museum dedicated to benches. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once a month, linear Abilene has a downtown <a href=""http://www.center-arts.com/artwalk/artwalk_about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artwalk</a> and this April it is going to include a <a href=""http://www.thegracemuseum.org/special-event/museum-of-the-bench"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scavenger Hunt</a> based on this Bench Museum. People will have 2 days to collect the answers. It will be fun.  And then on Saturday we will have the final festivities at the site.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I need your help.  We <em>all</em> need your help.  We want people, whether they play the Scavenger Hunt or not, to learn the stories of Kcymaerxthaere.  So we are planning to make many copies of our 51 trading cards of some of the benches to enrich the Scavenger Hunt and to give away around town. </div>

<div><strong>THIS STORY</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>For a while now, I have dreamed of the story of the Museum of the Bench, a 430,000 acre facility in and around what we call Abilene dedicated to displaying benches in their natural habitat.  In Kcymaerxthaere, a man named <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/of_age_and_craftsman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Park Lee Taf</a> would collect benches.  And after he found one he liked, he would make an exact replica to put replace the one he took, and he would bring the original to the Museum where he would build a vast, elaborate and hyperreal diorama in which to display it.  (Here is <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/waiting_for_the_grwost"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of those benches</a>.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I really wanted to make trading cards for such a compelling and mysterious museum.  I also wanted to tell stories on these cards because I love the idea of the reader picking up little fragments of the big story that way.  So I decided to wait a while for those ideas to germinate and for us to have installed more sites around the world.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Meanwhile I bought the least expensive piece of <a href=""http://www.reporternews.com/news/2012/jan/30/no-headline---artist_targets_abilene/?print=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">land in Abilene</a> that I could, but land that still had some character. And planned what the location would look like.  Now remember: it is not the whole museum--just a part of it (and just a remnant).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>About a year ago, I realized we were ready: that I finally knew where in the parallel world the benches in the collection would come from and began to contact some local artists to work on certain aspects of it (come and visit to see).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In early April we will begin installation and April 12, 2012 we celebrate with these cards and a <a href=""http://www.thegracemuseum.org/special-event/museum-of-the-bench-scavenger-hunt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scavenger hunt</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>ARE YOU REINTERPRETING LOCAL HISTORY?</strong></div>
<div>Not really.  To me, local history is fantastic--and Abilene's (<a href=""http://www.abilenetx.com/about/history.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""the Future Great City of West Texas""</a>) is no different.  No one needs me to dress it up.  What I hope that this project offers is something totally different, but also valuable and affecting: the chance to look at the landscape and the world in general in a completely new way. And that is what Kcymaerxthaere does in <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/forests_rest"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">place</a> after <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/krblin_jihn_cabin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">place</a>, all of which stitch together in the human mind.  Helping people see the <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/bragansas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">things</a> that aren't there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHO CARES WHAT'S NOT THERE?</strong></div>
<div>People ask me that all the time. All I can say is that for most of us, some of the most important things in our lives are the things that were vivid in our minds but did not exist--though they eventually did: a relationship, a business, our families, a career, whatever.  Experiencing a parallel world viscerally engages that part of ourselves.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHY HELP?</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em><strong>The cards are really cool</strong></em>--if you ever had a chance to go to a Museum of Bench, wouldn't you totally want the trading cards?  And get them for a friend?  Now you can!</div>
<div> <em><strong>It helps Abilene</strong></em>--small, wonderful communities like Abilene are under assault around the world.  So many economic pressures pull on them.  The big cities pull away the next generation, the big outside companies rarely reinvest in the community.  In a small way, a work of art like this whole project can give a shared experience for locals and be a magnet for visitors.  (Check out our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/events/131199600311317/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spelling Bee</a> in Paris, Illinois for proof.)</div>
<div> <em><strong>It supports the project</strong></em>--there is nothing like Kcymaerxthaere, a unique expression of <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/stories/kcymaerxthaere_mysterious_postcards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">multidimensional storytelling</a>.  If you help us fund this project, we have a whole new product to tell our story to the world with. (because the interlacing stories on the cards will do just that!)</div>

<div><strong>WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?</strong></div>
<div> The printing and wrapping of at least 500 complete sets of cards--enough to offer complete sets, wrapped packs of 11, and give away alot of cards for the scavenger hunt.</div>
<div>
<br/><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T RAISE ENOUGH?</strong>
</div>
<div> Excellent question.  We have found a digital printer who will print however many trading cards we need at a low cost.  A wonderful designer is doing the design for us already at ultra-low cost, so the primary cost here is the cost of the printing.  This let's us offer this as a perk, even though we are doing flexible funding.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU RAISE TOO MUCH</strong></div>
</div>
<div>We would love to have that problem!  And if we do, the whole Museum of the Bench installation has actually 2 phases of work.  Phase 1 will definitely be done in April, BUT if we get extra money, we can do Phase 1 and 2 at the same time (both involve large scale concrete forms).</div>

<p>The Art Monastery Project is dedicated to cultivating personal awakening and cultural transformation through art, contemplation, and community. The Art Monastery supports artists and produces cultural events both in the U.S. and at our pilot site in Italy.</p>
<p>What's special about the Art Monastery is pairing the monastic process with a really amazing art product. We strive to value the artist as a whole person as much as the art we create, and to make stunning, world-changing art through an inclusive, sacred process that blends traditional monasticism with a fresh, contemporary perspective.</p>
<h3>A bit of Art Monastery history</h3>
<p>This is the fifth year of the Art Monastery Project and we're so proud of all we've accomplished. We've produced dozens of concerts and events in the U.S., in addition to our annual silent meditation retreats that take place in California every winter. Also, we've established both short-term and long-term residency programs in Italy that have produced everything from Gregorian Chant concerts and other early music to deconstructed tap dance and site-specific visual art installations.</p>
<h3>What's special about this year?</h3>
<p>This year, we want to take it one step further and create something really special. This summer we're bringing nine American artists together in Italy for a full 90 days. It's our longest residency program yet, and the idea is to create a really intensive laboratory that will fuel innovative and meaningful art-making. We've chosen artists from all over the U.S. from various disciplines: Neva Cockrell, Anaya Cullen, Ryan Hazelbaker, Andi Hemmenway, and Raphael Sacks, to join our core team: Betsy McCall, Charles Darius, Molly Freedenberg, and me! On June 1 we’ll all gather here in the beautiful Italian countryside to devise one collaborative, multi-disciplinary theater piece. We'll spend the first six weeks in a monastic development period that will include nightly Gregorian Chant, shared meals and chores, and a rigorous communal schedule. The final six weeks, we will tour the work to Italian festivals, aspiring to change the lives of the people who experience the show.</p>
<h3>How will the AMP use the money?</h3>

At the Art Monastery, we believe that getting a group of artists together in a focused setting, in the spirit of a monastic community - an Otherhood - we believe that this is a radical act. We believe that this radical act is WORTH something in the world, that the creation of art is powerful and important, that the value of contemplation can't be measured, and that the creation of meaning is the most valuable thing of all. <br/><br/>We believe that great art and great monks really can change the world. <br/><br/>We hope you'll join us.<br/><br/>Thank you.</p></div>","What's the story with the Art Monastery?
The Art Monastery Project is dedicated to cultivating personal awakening and cultural transformation through art, contemplation, and community. The Art Monastery supports artists and produces cultural events both in the U.S. and at our pilot site in Italy.
What's special about the Art Monastery is pairing the monastic process with a really amazing art product. We strive to value the artist as a whole person as much as the art we create, and to make stunning, world-changing art through an inclusive, sacred process that blends traditional monasticism with a fresh, contemporary perspective.
A bit of Art Monastery history
This is the fifth year of the Art Monastery Project and we're so proud of all we've accomplished. We've produced dozens of concerts and events in the U.S., in addition to our annual silent meditation retreats that take place in California every winter. Also, we've established both short-term and long-term residency programs in Italy that have produced everything from Gregorian Chant concerts and other early music to deconstructed tap dance and site-specific visual art installations.
What's special about this year?
This year, we want to take it one step further and create something really special. This summer we're bringing nine American artists together in Italy for a full 90 days. It's our longest residency program yet, and the idea is to create a really intensive laboratory that will fuel innovative and meaningful art-making. We've chosen artists from all over the U.S. from various disciplines: Neva Cockrell, Anaya Cullen, Ryan Hazelbaker, Andi Hemmenway, and Raphael Sacks, to join our core team: Betsy McCall, Charles Darius, Molly Freedenberg, and me! On June 1 we’ll all gather here in the beautiful Italian countryside to devise one collaborative, multi-disciplinary theater piece. We'll spend the first six weeks in a monastic development period that will include nightly Gregorian Chant, shared meals and chores, and a rigorous communal schedule. The final six weeks, we will tour the work to Italian festivals, aspiring to change the lives of the people who experience the show.
How will the AMP use the money?
Your money goes to a lot of really awesome, practical, useful things that will make this summer’s programming possible! For example: an electric guitar, a video projector, costumes and fabric, power cords and converters, fixing the broken keys on our piano, just to name a few. One of the guiding principles at the Art Monastery is Resourcefulness, so it’s one of our highest priorities to make sure that your money goes a long way.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi there!  I'm Nate Courteau and I've been an independent special effects artist and sculptor since the early 90's and if there's one thing that I've learned in all my years, it's that Zombies make the world go 'round!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I first designed the Bobble Dead back in 2006. I wanted to create a fun product that had instant appeal and a proven background. Well, Bobbleheads have been around since ancient China, and Zombies are not only back en vogue, but hotter than ever! So, after talking to various toy companies, I decided to launch the first wave independently, gauge the response and possibly sell the property to a manufacturer. But to do this, I need to fund a small run of each Bobble Dead, around 250 copies of each and that's where YOU come in! YAY!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bobble Dead are part of a larger business model conceived by Nate Courteau and his business, n8-fx. Formerly Courteau Sculpture Studio, n8-fx supplies special makeup effects, props and sculpture to various industries and the ultimate goal is to help grow and sustain the local arts community through viable and ethical business practices.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> I currently have three completed Bobble Dead prototype dolls, I'd love to have all three manufactured for sale, and it's costs roughly $3000.00 each for a run of 250.  </p>
<p>If this campaign is successful and indeed surpasses the initial goal, all of the additional money will go to production of the first three Bobble Dead dolls as well as improve and expand the Bobble Dead line, develop its web identity and promotions.  If the initial goal is not reached with this campaign, the existing money will go into the production of the first one or two Bobble Dead dolls; and the proceeds from these will go into further production. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>YOU can help spread the love and warming, warming love that only a bobbling zombie can! Please spread the word via any medium you can think of; Internets, telephone, (cell or land line), rumor, underground magazine, cup-and-string, message in a bottle, confession, (provided the priest is unethical) careless whispers and ETC! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><font size=""5"">But with all sincerity, I'm hoping that you could be a part of the successful, domestic, and ethical business I've always wanted to realize. Any help would be so very appreciated. Thank you!!</font></p>

<p>Solana Beach asked me for the sculpture just as the school was pooring footings to anchore the sculpture.   Solana Beach only has $500 which is intended to cover the cost of transporting an already existing sculpture.  This is why I am reaching out to all of you for help.  Let's a <em>new</em> Tree Pose Sculpture.   The new one will be a slightly different expression of the same idea.  The main difference will be the surface and color.   With more funds I can make it bigger and better.  With less funds I will make it smaller.  With your help it will be big enough to look like a true monument.</p>
<p>Some of the funding will go towards materials, some will go towards transportation of such a large sculpture, and some of it will help me support my family while I work on it.

<p><strong>What is Beautiful People?</strong></p>
<p>Beautiful People is a photographic book with stories, in which i want to help overcome stereotypical portraiture of the lives of people in Roma communities. To me Roma are beautiful and proud people, whose culture and identity have been almost systematically destroyed by several regimes in the recent history of Central Europe.</p>
<p>The people in my photographs live in the worst possible conditions just outside of the town Kezmarok, in Velka Lomnica, Slovakia. 2.000 people live without water supplies and canalization. But despite the slum-like conditions, their houses are always clean and tidy. And every one has at least one set of nice clothes for special occasions. When I portrayed them, i asked them to show themselves in the way that they want to be seen.</p>
<p>These photographs show men and women who try to live a better life. Men and women who show us that change is possible.  </p>
<p> </p>

<p>The book Beautiful People will be an important resource of how to approach a broad and foreign audience.

<p> </p></div>","What is Beautiful People?
Beautiful People is a photographic book with stories, in which i want to help overcome stereotypical portraiture of the lives of people in Roma communities. To me Roma are beautiful and proud people, whose culture and identity have been almost systematically destroyed by several regimes in the recent history of Central Europe.
The people in my photographs live in the worst possible conditions just outside of the town Kezmarok, in Velka Lomnica, Slovakia. 2.000 people live without water supplies and canalization. But despite the slum-like conditions, their houses are always clean and tidy. And every one has at least one set of nice clothes for special occasions. When I portrayed them, i asked them to show themselves in the way that they want to be seen.
These photographs show men and women who try to live a better life. Men and women who show us that change is possible.

 in Reykjavik, Iceland. While there I will have access to a living space
 and a studio and will be able to explore new installation and large 
scale drawing ideas. Over the course of two months I plan to make and 
document a series of new installations that deal with multiples and 
miniatures, generate a new series of drawings that deal with landscape, 
line work and texture, and take in the art scene of Iceland. I will also
 take a few trips around the country on several of the weekends to 
collect images, sketches, and experiences for my work. And I have wanted to go to Iceland since I was a kid so I will, in general, be elated and camera happy the whole time I'm there.<br/><br/>For the 
month of August I am planning to back pack around Europe and eastern 
Europe. I have not planned the itinerary as yet, though it will include 
several cities where I know artists and where I plan to 
collaborate/experiment. As well, I see this time in between as a way to 
absorb more fuel for making and to process the work I made while in 
Iceland.  The cities on the list to be narrowed down, no doubt, are 
Glasgow, London, Berlin, Budapest, Vienna, Toulon, Barcelona. <br/><br/>For
 the months of September and October I will be at another residency called DRAWInternational in 
Caylus, France, where I will be working with a group of artists on the 
question ""what is drawing?"" This residency will allow for both group 
exploration and solo studio time and it's emphasis is on drawing - in 
particular, the experimentation of drawing and it's possibilities.

<p>With great excitement and anticipation we are planning to make DOCNOW 2013 the best yet.

These outlets will help to increase the visibility of the important issues addressed in the films, photography and new media installations. </p>
<p>As a student run, non-profit arts festival, the majority of our budget comes from the funds that we are able to raise ourselves. All of the money raised in this campaign, whether we reach our goal or not will go directly towards expenses such as venue costs and promotional materials – both of which are vital to the successful operation of DOCNOW 2013.

<p>Although Toronto has a rich tradition of expression in the documentary arts, with festivals like Hot Docs and CONTACT, DOCNOW offers the unique perspective of being a free, mixed-media festival. Far from being a simple student festival, DOCNOW features artists, both emerging and established, from a diverse range of cultural and artistic backgrounds. As such, DOCNOW is becoming a vital part of Toronto's artistic community, however we cannot successfully build the profile and visibility of the festival without the support of our generous donors.</p>

<p>Hi! ALEGRIA: Hope through Art inspires and empowers the most underserved youth and their communities to achieve their potential and transform their lives through the arts. What began as a grassroots effort of communities has grown into a movement invested in seeing the trajectory of youth's lives changed. Hogar de la Sagrada Familia is a haven for abandoned children living in the outskirts of Lima, Peru. ALEGRIA supports La Sagrada Familia through arts education and sustainable resources that allow the children to thrive. We are currently creating capacity to support additional youth in need, and strengthening ALEGRIA as a partner of these communities. This coming year, ALEGRIA plans to partner with NYC nonprofit organizations to provide intensive summer v<span>isual arts, slam poetry, hip-hop, fashion and photography </span>programming for 50 youth in need. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>$10,000 will provide 8 weeks of intensive summer visual arts, slam poetry, hip-hop, fashion and photography programming for 50 NYC youth who deserve the chance to artistically express themselves! These kids have endured tough situations at home and will benefit from creatively exploring the world around them.</p>
<p>To break it down:</p>
<p>$5,000 will go toward supplies and field trip costs- paper, pencils, charcoal, paints, markers, ink, glue, brushes, fabric, thread, sewing machines, cameras, space rentals, and transportation and entrance fees for the kids to attend<span> unique creative performances and experiences.</span></p>
<p>$2,000 will go toward sustainability- extra supplies, lesson plans for a continuation of programming, future hours dedicated to ensure that the kids have the opportunity to further their interest in creative arts.</p>
<p>$1,500 will go toward program planning and administration- 80+ hours of planning will be dedicated to ensure that these kids receive the best supplies, attention and guidance possible.</p>
<p>$1,500 will go toward stipends- teachers will dedicate two-weeks of their time sharing their visual art, poetry, hip-hop, fashion and photography craft with the kids.</p>
<p>When we say intensive- we mean hands on, one-on-one attention for kids who will greatly benefit from creative outlets.</p>
<p><em>ALEGRIA: Hope through Art is a 501(c)3 charity and your donations are tax-exempt to the extent of the law. You will receive a tax-deductible receipt for your contribution.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Art is universal. Hopelessness is universal. New York City is home to many of the world's most renowned artists and creative experiences, yet we also have so many youth who face tremendous odds. We are so excited to inspire and empower underserved youth in NYC through artistic opportunities and arts education resources they would have never otherwise experienced.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Even if you are not able to make a contribution today, share, share, SHARE. Use the Indiegogo share tools to send our campaign to friends and family who may be inspired to give today. If you are an artist, and would like to talk more about joining the ALEGRIA team, please contact us. ALEGRIA means joy. We find joy in sharing and building community, and we hope you will too.</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Banff National Park. Growing up I took courses at the Banff School of Fine Arts and spend many hours with my family in the mountains hiking and fishing (I was painting). After high school graduation I attended the Kootenay School of Art in Nelson B.C. Then I got married and had 3 beautiful girls. Later, I found myself supporting my children alone. I went back to school twice, once doing equine studies and working with racehorses and then to study computer science. I worked as a computer professional with the government for 20 years while raising my girls. Through those years I drew and painted whenever I could find the time. I retired as soon as I had enough of a pension to support myself. I knew I would not have much money to live on but I wanted to try being a full time artist before I got too old. <strong><em>Now I have this wonderful opportunity to paint in the </em></strong><strong><em>Arctic</em></strong><strong><em> as well as on the north shores of </em></strong><strong><em>Lake Superior</em></strong><strong><em> but I need your help to be able to do it.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What is this Campaign all about?</h2>
<p>I was looking for a way to travel to Canada’s Parks to paint when I learned about Parks Canada Artist in Residence programs so I applied to a few. I am thrilled to say my efforts were rewarded with not one Artist in Residence program but two!</p>
<p>The one I am most excited about is called “<strong>Art in the Park at Ivvavik National Park”</strong>. It takes place in June 2012. Ivvavik National Park is in the top Northwestern Corner of the Yukon. It borders on Alaska on the Western side and the Beaufort Sea (Arctic Ocean) on the northern side. Out of the many artists that applied only 3 were chosen from the list of applicants and 3 more participants that are beneficiaries of the Inuvialuit land claim. So Northern and Southern Canadian painters will be living and painting together. We will be flown from Inuvik to Ivvavik to live in tents and paint together for 2 weeks in June. The bugs are ‘best” then apparently and the caribou are migrating through the park along with their predators, wolves and grizzly bears. 3 Parks Canada employees will be along as our guides and protectors. I am sure the exchange of ideas will be very illuminating! Oh Yes! There will be 24 hours of sunlight so we can paint all night too!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second Project  is called “<strong>Artist-In-Residence Pukaskwa National Park</strong>”. It takes place the last week of August 2012.  Pukaskwa National Park is located in Ontario on the Northeast shores of Lake Superior on Heron Bay. I will live in the campgrounds at the park and give 2, 2 hour workshops for visitors to the park. I will give a workshop on “Creating a Travel Sketchbook” and one on “Plein Air Watercolors”. I will be painting in the park and my work will be on display in the Information Center.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2> What do I need and what will you get in return?</h2>
<h3>For Project #1 Art in the Park at Ivvavil National Park</h3>
<p>Parks Canada covers all expenses for the Ivvavik Project once I get to Inuvik Northwest Territories. Getting that far is the expensive part. Parks Canada will reimburse me up to $500.00 for travel to Inuvik. The problem is the return flight to Inuvik from Edmonton is over $2000.00. And I have to get to Edmonton. I will stay in Alberta and visit relatives and they will pay my way back to Ottawa. I have applied for grants with the Canada Council for the Arts but discovered their grants do not cover a project put on by another government department. I tried to apply for a travel grant from the Ontario Arts Council but they only cover travel between Ontario and Quebec. They do have an exhibition grant that I expect to be applying for in the fall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a list of expenses I need to cover.</p>
<p>One way to Edmonton                                                               255.00</p>
<p>2 nights in a hotel in Edmonton (one night each way)              176.00</p>
<p>Return from Edmonton to Inuvik                                             1952.00</p>
<p>Sub Total Travel                                                     2383.00</p>
<p>Art Supplies</p>
<p>  Watercolor Blocks (paper) Arches 9 * 12                                 43.00</p>
<p>Total                                                                                         2426.00</p>
<p>Minus a gift from a dear friend who has already contributed <strong>1600.00</strong>!</p>
<p>Total I still need for this trip                                                      826.00</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>For Project #2 Artist-in-Residence  Pukaskwa National Park</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For the second project I will need to drive my car to Pukaskwa National Park and then I will be given a campsite once I get there. (Both projects involve camping). I need gas and hotel money for this project.</p>
<p>Gas for my car (Pt Cruiser traveling  981 kms each way)</p>
<p>For a total of 1962 kms. Since I get around 10km per liter (although sometimes less)</p>
<p> 196.2 liters @ 1.25 (hope the price stays stable)  =  245.25 for gas so lets round that up to                                     250.00</p>
<p>13 hours 19 mins  - this is too far for me to drive in one day.</p>
<p>Two nights in a hotel each way                                     200.00</p>
<p>So this project will cost me approximately                     450.00</p>
<strong>Total needed for both trips                                              1276.00</strong><br/><p><strong>What will you get in return? <br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$10.00 – a post card with an image from one of the National Parks in the   project signed by the artist and a big thank you</li>
<li>$25.00 -  6""x6"" original sketch created in Ivvavick National Park signed by the artist</li>
<li>$50.00 -  6""x6"" original sketches, one created in Ivvavik National Park and one created in Pukaskwa National Park, each signed by the artist.</li>
<li>$75.00 – Your choice of a 7” * 10” original watercolour painting done in either National Park</li>
<li>$100.00 – A photocopy of the watercolour journal that I will create while in the Arctic ( Ivvavik National Park)</li>
</ul>
<p>If it should happen that I do not achieve the full amount of the campaign, I have already purchased my tickets to Inuvik on borrowed money so I would still go to Ivavik National Park and not be able to repay the loan. I would have to consider canceling my trip to Pukaskwa.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>  Parks Canada believes that work produced and exhibited by artists visiting and painting in the park will reach a much broader urban audience than other outreach efforts. Each artist is required to donate one of their paintings created at Ivvavik National Park to Parks Canada to use in their promotions.</p>
<p> I have told Parks Canada that I will exhibit work done in the Park in Ottawa, Quebec and perhaps in other provinces in order for Canadians to develop a stronger sense of connection to the park. I did not know about this park before I applied for this project!  I believe I will be inspired by these remote wilderness areas and by the communication with the others artists. I believe it is so important to preserve these areas. Your contributions will make this all possible.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p><strong>SHARE</strong></p>
<p>Let everyone know, please pass it along – Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Thank you, thank you!</strong></p>
<p>I wish to thank all my friends that have already contributed by lending me such things a tent, sleeping bag, mattress, down vests, quick dry towels, bug jacket, mosquito hat and pack sacks.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>For over 20 years I’ve been putting words together because I love to write. I fell in love with poetry when I was in High School. I love the art. It was my hobby, something I found more entertaining than anything in this world. In 2005 when my dad drowned due to staying in New Orleans for hurricane Katrina, poetry became my therapy. Before Katrina I hadn’t performed spoken word much. Just at school mostly. It wasn’t until I moved back to New Orleans that I started hitting the stage and performing in front of people. In 2008 I put out my first book “I Write To…” That’s when I started to move towards a more professional mind frame concerning poetry. But I still was in school for nursing, still maintaining my day job as a front end Supervisor at Whole Foods Market. Fast forward to 2013, I successfully started my own company SWMN Publishing, I published 7 books, 6 books are my books, One of my books is currently being sold in a Whole Foods Market, I’ve recorded 3 spoken word albums, my words have reached countries all over the world, I’m Write NOLA Festivals 2012 Writer of the Year, I’m one of the faces of spoken word in New Orleans, I’ve successfully organized or helped organize many spoken word events in my city, and I’m currently traveling the United States.  Days after being fired from Whole Foods Market where I was employed for 10 yrs of my life, I’m sitting here reflecting on my journey thus far. I’ve wanted to quit my job at Whole Foods for some time now. But I wanted to quit when I felt I was financially ready. Honestly I’m not sure if I ever would have quit because I was too comfortable. The Money was good. The job was easy. Those who were above me gave me the time I needed to travel and perform. But on the other hand I didn’t sleep much, there was shows I had to turn down because I couldn’t get that particular day off or I didn’t know ahead of time and I had to decline. Now I don’t have Whole Foods in my way of my true passion. It’s bittersweet because I loved some of the people I worked with. I loved the opportunities the job gave me. I mean I spent 10 yrs of my life working for the company. I only had 2 solid jobs before that. Funny all of those years came to an end because I got caught using my cell phone and was told on. My fault completely. I was trying to manage the many things I do outside of Whole Foods while working at Whole Foods. It caught up to me. So they fired me. The sweet side is, I got what I wanted. God has given me the opportunity to pursue something fully that I was halfway pursuing. I’m sitting here today a full time Artist/Publisher, self employed, no money, but I’m happy. I finally feel free. I can’t lie and say I’m not a bit nervous for this new stage in my life. I can’t lie and say this will be easy. But I can say I’m going to do my best. I’ve failed myself. I’ve let myself down. I was on such a roll and lost balance. Now I have no choice but to maintain my focus and work harder than ever before. But I can’t do this alone. I need my family more than ever. I need my friends more than ever. All of my fans I need YOU more than ever. My art will literally keep me fed and put a roof over my head. Without your help I’m not sure where I will be. All I ask is that you support me and trust that I will give you my best. Purchase my books/CDs, visit my website sexwithmynotebook.com, tell your friends about me, and be looking forward to what I have coming in the future. This is my life. I welcome everyone to take this journey with me.</p>

Fast forward to 2013, I successfully started my own company SWMN Publishing, I published 7 books, 6 books are my books, One of my books is currently being sold in a Whole Foods Market, I’ve recorded 3 spoken word albums, my words have reached countries all over the world, I’m Write NOLA Festivals 2012 Writer of the Year, I’m one of the faces of spoken word in New Orleans, I’ve successfully organized or helped organize many spoken word events in my city, and I’m currently traveling the United States.  Days after being fired from Whole Foods Market where I was employed for 10 yrs of my life, I’m sitting here reflecting on my journey thus far. I’ve wanted to quit my job at Whole Foods for some time now. But I wanted to quit when I felt I was financially ready. Honestly I’m not sure if I ever would have quit because I was too comfortable. The Money was good. The job was easy. Those who were above me gave me the time I needed to travel and perform. But on the other hand I didn’t sleep much, there was shows I had to turn down because I couldn’t get that particular day off or I didn’t know ahead of time and I had to decline. Now I don’t have Whole Foods in my way of my true passion. It’s bittersweet because I loved some of the people I worked with. I loved the opportunities the job gave me. I mean I spent 10 yrs of my life working for the company. I only had 2 solid jobs before that. Funny all of those years came to an end because I got caught using my cell phone and was told on. My fault completely. I was trying to manage the many things I do outside of Whole Foods while working at Whole Foods. It caught up to me. So they fired me. The sweet side is, I got what I wanted. God has given me the opportunity to pursue something fully that I was halfway pursuing. I’m sitting here today a full time Artist/Publisher, self employed, no money, but I’m happy. I finally feel free. I can’t lie and say I’m not a bit nervous for this new stage in my life. I can’t lie and say this will be easy. But I can say I’m going to do my best. I’ve failed myself. I’ve let myself down. I was on such a roll and lost balance. Now I have no choice but to maintain my focus and work harder than ever before. But I can’t do this alone. I need my family more than ever. I need my friends more than ever. All of my fans I need YOU more than ever. My art will literally keep me fed and put a roof over my head. Without your help I’m not sure where I will be. All I ask is that you support me and trust that I will give you my best. Purchase my books/CDs, visit my website sexwithmynotebook.com, tell your friends about me, and be looking forward to what I have coming in the future. This is my life. I welcome everyone to take this journey with me.

<p>I was suggested by a <em>really good</em> friend of mine to create this Indiegogo and help pave the way to my magical experience on the playa for the first time ever.</p>
<p>This year I was granted a low income ticket, and even with that <em>AMAZING</em> help and opportunity, I am not working enough to translate my income into the de-virginizing journey into the desert this year.</p>

<p>This is where you can help! I totally understand it's a difficult task to just give away money, and I know, who is really deserving of free money? I certainly don't think I am.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> it would mean the world to me if anyone of you could aid me in this situation. I thought I was going to be financially stable this far out after graduation but it appears that is not the case. A couple situations occured and more money was needed than originally planned.

<p>If there is any amount of money you want to drop into the Get-Ryan-to-the-Playa fund this is the place to do so. I don't expect to reach the (minimum allowed) goal of $500 but if that does happen, then my entire trip should be fully funded by the love of my friends and family!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the cost of the ticket, this Indiegogo will cover my other expenses for the trip as well! I will be staying in The Neighborhood camp that my friends created and are located at 8 &amp; Extraterrestrial.

<h3>The LED Zeppelin Needs Your HELP!</h3>
<p>The LED Zeppelin made its first appearance out on the playa last year and provided entertainment for many.  For those that don't know of it here's a brief:</p>
<p>The Zeppelin is built on an electric vehicle platform composed of a 3hp electric motor and deep cycle batteries.  Angelo Figallo and I radically modified it into a large 14 person Zeppelin with 960 high-lumens LED lamps.  The lamps are controlled by an array of solid state relays and on-board computer system that synchronize to music.</p>
<p>Video and photos of the LED Zeppelin here:</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Problem and The Resolution</h3>
<div>
<p>Despite efforts to recondition the power system on the vehicle we have been met with problems.  The current battery system is depleted and has also caused irreversable corrosion on the primary power wires.  The system needs a total of 18 new 6v deep cycle batteries to move and <strong>they are not cheap!  </strong>Your donations go towards the purchase of new batteries and wiring!</p>

<h3>Contribute to Burning Man Art</h3>
<p>Burning Man is an experience that is made by the people.  Without artist, musicians, actors, and other creativity the event would not exist.</p>
<p>This is the 2nd Mutant Vehicle over the course of 9 years I have brought to the playa.  They take an incredible amount of effort, resources, ingenuity, and HELP to build.  Any contributions bring this closer to lighting up the playa and putting wows on people's faces!</p>

<h3>WHY A CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>I am married to my high school sweetheart, Andrew, and we have been together for 12 years. After a few years of being unsuccessful in naturally expanding our family, we are so excited to announce that WE ARE ADOPTING! We are eager to be parents but the adoption process can be quite long, unpredictable, and expensive. The idea to crowdfund with my artwork in an effort to raise funds for our infant adoption came to me early on. I have been working hard the last few months to crank out a new body of work just for this campaign.</p>
<p>To my surprise, my idea of home has changed drastically for me and I am excited to see how this will reflect in my artmaking. Our home will feel empty until we are matched with Baby Temple and this inspired me to create my ""There’s No Place Like Home"" campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT THE ARTWORK</h3>
<p>All of the paintings in this campaign are original and most are made specifically for this campaign. Since we currently have an 'empty nest' I began a new series of work inspired by 'empty homes' located in Omaha, Nebraska. ‘Empty’ makes reference to homes that are not currently occupied. They may be between renters, on the market to sell, foreclosed by the bank, or just abandoned. As an artist, I am engaged with expressing ‘home’ as a physical structure and vessel that holds us as humans. </p>
</div><div>
<p><i>All of the perks I am offering are original paintings in a variety of sizes. </i>In my artistic process, I paint and draw on watercolor paper and once I feel the piece is almost complete, I adhere the paper onto 1.5” depth wood panels. I add some final touches, like painting the sides of the piece, and then attach hanging hardware on the back.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>The entire adoption process can cost upwards of $40,000 depending on: what the birthmother’s medical needs are, agency starter costs, state-mandated education/homestudy, fingerprinting/background checks, and travel costs to pick up Baby Temple (our agency is out of state). There can also be additional medical/travel costs if the infant has to stay in the hospital longer than expected due to an early birth, Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, or unresolved paperwork. 100% of the funds raised will be put towards our infant adoption.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<p><i>Step 1:</i> Select the painting size you would like on the right hand side of the campaign page and follow the steps to donate funds.</p>
<p><i>Step 2:</i> Wait anxiously and excitedly to ""adopt"" a painting of mine as I personally select your piece and prepare for a stork drop!</p>
<p><i>Step 3:</i> Receive your new ""bundle of joy"" via mail or drop-off(local to Omaha only).</p>

<p>Please spread the word with friends, family, and co-workers that you think may like my work, especially on your social media platforms!

</div></div>","WHY A CAMPAIGN
I am married to my high school sweetheart, Andrew, and we have been together for 12 years. After a few years of being unsuccessful in naturally expanding our family, we are so excited to announce that WE ARE ADOPTING! We are eager to be parents but the adoption process can be quite long, unpredictable, and expensive. The idea to crowdfund with my artwork in an effort to raise funds for our infant adoption came to me early on. I have been working hard the last few months to crank out a new body of work just for this campaign.
To my surprise, my idea of home has changed drastically for me and I am excited to see how this will reflect in my artmaking. Our home will feel empty until we are matched with Baby Temple and this inspired me to create my ""There’s No Place Like Home"" campaign.

<h3>What is Second Street Gallery?</h3>
<p>Founded in 1973, Second Street Gallery is the oldest nonprofit (501(c)3) community run contemporary art space in Central Virginia and is now one of the oldest nonprofit galleries in the United States. Established by a group of ten artists affiliated with the University of Virginia and the local community, SSG was the first art space in Downtown Charlottesville and a leader in the revitalization of the Historic District. It is now located inside the City Center for Contemporary Arts building at Water and Second Streets. Completed in 2003, the CCCA also houses two other nonprofit groups, Live Arts (a community theater) and Light House Studio (a youth media organization).</p>
<p>SSG presents 10 to 14 separate exhibitions each year. In addition, SSG presents a full calendar of related educational and outreach activities that complement its exhibition season.</p>
<p>SSG’s primary mission is <i>to enliven Virginia through access to the best in contemporary art and artists and to inspire new ways of thinking, seeing, and doing</i>. We do this through:</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAMMATIC EXCELLENCE:</strong> SSG has a 45-year history of exhibiting the very best “art of our time” through the presentation of contemporary art in a professional gallery space, on par with major art galleries in much larger cities.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: </strong>SSG provides a resource for those interested in contemporary art and encourages an appreciation of contemporary art and culture by educating the public through exhibitions, lectures, workshops, classes, tours, and publications.</p>
<p><strong>INSTITUTIONAL STEWARDSHIP: </strong>SSG has a history of providing the resources and personnel necessary to maintain and promote programmatic and organizational excellence. Our current Executive Director &amp; Curator brings over 14 years’ experience at a highly competitive and successful art gallery in New York City to SSG. The gallery is supported by memberships, donations from the local community, and grants from foundations and the state.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need to Raise $45,000 for SEASON 45</h3>
<p>For the past two years, Second Street Gallery has been the recipient of a generous grant from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts that assists with funding for our exhibition season and related programming. This year, our multi-year grant is ending, and we are required to take a year off before applying for additional funding. Unfortunately, this leaves an enormous gap in our Season 45 exhibition budget. That’s why we are asking for assistance from you—our community, our neighbors, and our friends—to try to raise at least <strong>$45,000 for SEASON 45!</strong></p>
<p>To continue to bring the best of contemporary art and artists to Central Virginia, just as we have for the past 45 years, we need your support for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Art Shipping ($11,000):</strong> Shipping art is expensive! A large portion of our exhibition costs stems from transporting works of art to Charlottesville from all over the country and the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Printing ($6,000):</strong> Exhibition cards, posters, wall texts, vinyl signage, and graphic design work is necessary for publicizing every SSG show or event.</li>
<li>
<strong>Artist Expenses ($5,000):</strong> SSG believes that it is important to support artists, not only through the presentation of their artwork in exhibitions, but also through necessary financial sponsorship. Examples of this support include artist travel, stipends for workshops, and assistance with art production costs (such as framing).</li>
<li>
<strong>Insurance ($5,000): </strong>We need to keep our artwork safe, whether in transit or here in the gallery. Artwork insurance is a costly but absolutely necessary expense.</li>
<li>
<strong>Outreach Opportunities ($5,000):</strong> Giving back locally is a core part of SSG’s mission, which is why we encourage our exhibiting artists to participate in FREE artist talks and hands-on outreach workshops throughout the community. We partner with organizations such as Charlottesville City Schools and the Boys &amp; Girls Club on these outreach opportunities. Help us keep these workshops and events going!</li>
<li>
<strong>Installation and Packing ($4,000):</strong> SSG hires professional art handlers to assist the curator with the installation of each exhibition. This doesn’t just guarantee the safety and integrity of the artwork; it also improves the overall quality of the installation. After each show, the artwork is uninstalled and professionally wrapped with care before being returned to the artists.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lighting ($3,000): </strong>SSG has a professional lighting rig that rivals some NYC galleries. But we need to keep the lights on and replace bulbs as needed. This will ensure that each work in our exhibitions is shown in its best light—literally and figuratively!</li>
<li>
<strong>Gallery Maintenance ($2,500): </strong>We need to repaint and repair our walls, polish the floors, clean the windows, and keep the gallery looking clean and professional throughout the season.</li>
<li>
<strong>Photography ($2,000):</strong> We like to supply our exhibiting artists with professional installation photos from each show. These photos (and by extension, our shows) are also shared online with the rest of the world. We loving sharing photos of our friends and neighbors enjoying art here in the gallery, whether at an exhibition opening, First Friday, or other special event.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public and Community Events ($1,500): </strong>We hope you enjoy attending our First Friday opening receptions as much as we love hosting you! Although we do receive generous donations of food and wine for these events, we incur a number of other expenses throughout the year, including ABC licenses, cleaning supplies, paper goods, and ice.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p><i>As you can see, a lot goes in to running a gallery and putting on a full season of exhibitions! </i>Our $45,000 goal is only a portion of our overall Operating Budget of $200,000.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we would like to publish exhibition catalogues for a few of our shows this season. We would also love to make a few equipment upgrades (a new iPad, a new database, and a new desktop computer) in the gallery and start planning for our Season 46!</p>
<h3>Why Your Support Impacts the Entire Community</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign to fund our 45th Season of exhibitions, you are helping both the gallery (with shipping, travel, installation, insurance, and other costs), and providing opportunities and support to the artist(s) who exhibit with us. In just the past 5 seasons, Second Street Gallery has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Held <strong>52</strong> exhibitions in our Main and Dové Gallery spaces.</li>
<li>Exhibited the work of over <strong>189</strong> artists.</li>
<li>Provided the community with over <strong>133</strong>  FREE exhibition-related programs, such as workshops, artist talks, and over events.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are also making a contribution to the arts and culture scene that makes Charlottesville such a great place to live, visit, work, and learn! Thanks to the generosity of some of our community sponsors and talented artists, we are able to offer some exciting perks as part of our $45,000 for SEASON 45 Campaign.<br/> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>SSG is a lean organization; both our full-time Executive Director/Chief Curator and part-time Outreach Coordinator work tirelessly to make the gallery programs best in class. SSG’s small staff is supported in this effort by active, engaged volunteers and a dedicated working board with diverse skill sets and areas of expertise.</p>
<p>Second Street Gallery has an incredible year planned for our 2018–2019 season—12 exhibitions and related programming with almost 100 exhibiting artists—but without help we will not be able to execute the season we have planned. We need community support so we can keep or doors open and continue to connect, excite, and educate through artist-led community programming. Your financial contribution to SSG is more important than ever before!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>Help Us Spread the Word! Make your gift go further by considering a few ways of inviting others into this community-based effort:</p>

Risks and Challenges
SSG is a lean organization; both our full-time Executive Director/Chief Curator and part-time Outreach Coordinator work tirelessly to make the gallery programs best in class. SSG’s small staff is supported in this effort by active, engaged volunteers and a dedicated working board with diverse skill sets and areas of expertise.
Second Street Gallery has an incredible year planned for our 2018–2019 season—12 exhibitions and related programming with almost 100 exhibiting artists—but without help we will not be able to execute the season we have planned. We need community support so we can keep or doors open and continue to connect, excite, and educate through artist-led community programming. Your financial contribution to SSG is more important than ever before!

<p> </p>
<h3>A Quick Background</h3>
<p>Thanks to the local community the launch of <a href=""http://www.thekelseytheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Kelsey Theater</a> has been a growing success, and even given birth to what we now call <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/LakeParkArtsDistrict/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lake Park Arts District</a>. That left us wondering, ""What else can we do to make Lake Park great?"" The answer is to utilize the only real estate we have left in a project that benefits local artists and the community alike.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481476474/o9toafgxdejogezafllq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Where others saw only a blank wall <a href=""http://www.singlehandedstudio.com/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A.J. Brockman</a> and company saw a blank canvas with seemingly endless opportunities. The plan is to turn the backside of the 700 block into a giant mural with contributions from multiple artists. Much like Miami's Wynwood we are taking an otherwise unremarkable alleyway and turning it into a cultural destination.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481476222/pe6waz50a21jzzwjvn0t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So why are we raising money? All of the artists involved are professionals, people who make their living from their art. Many times people get artists to do something like this in exchange for ""exposure"" and as artists ourselves we feel that is not always fair. They deserve compensation for their contribution. So the money raised will first purchase the materials needed and then every remaing cent will go to paying the artists for their work. </p>
<p>Won't you join us and make Lake Park beautiful again? <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481476897/gihudnhubrgzdi92qxi6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, we need to fill this wall with eye-popping color that will make The Lake Park Arts District visible from outer space! Okay, maybe that's a bit unrealistic, but we still want to beautify this town with public art. The extent to which the wall gets painted depends on how much money we raise. Here is a quick illustration for those visual learners. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484167816/x8zweyvvcrt10rkz15vc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>100% of all the funds raised will be going towards supplies, rental equipment, permitting and actually paying these artists because artwork is WORK. Once we reach our initial goal any additional money raised will be put into escrow and applied to the next round of muralists until we are able to paint the entire 700 building (pretty much a city block). After that, we start again right back at the beginning so there is always fresh imagery to inspire our community.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481483126/v7z6ztz7ww4b9igckcjx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are also partnering with local businesses, art stores, construction companies, and the suppliers themselves in order to minimize the amount of money we have to actually spend to make this wall happen. In turn, we are able to put more money into the artist pockets allowing them to continue to share their work and make a living.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481483151/ymabsojvevezf0vbwqhz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Now to the good part… What you get in return for your support! We have a bunch of great perks at all different contribution levels, the majority of which center around ""The Back Alley Art Festival"" scheduled for January 28, 2017 from 1 PM to 11 PM. This will serve as our official wrap party and unveiling of the finished mural. Food trucks, vendors, craft beer, live music, art demonstrations, and much more will be going down as we put the finishing touches on this masterpiece the day of. Not a local? No problem, many of our perks are easily shipped so you can help support this project from anywhere in the world.

I am Sheridan James Lunt, an artist living and working in Bristol, England.


I make animations under the name Piski Films, and you can see my work in the video clip above. 


I’ve had a life-long fascination with playing cards and poker decks, and over the years I've made a wonderful personal collection of some curious and beautiful card decks. 


Late last year I designed my own poker deck.




My Dream...


I wanted to make something beautiful and unique, that would celebrate diversity, and would be full of little surprises that reward repeated study.


The finished deck got a great response from those who saw it, and on the advice of friends, I've set up this campaign to get the Piski Poker Deck printed.


I’d like to see it made to the very highest standard, with fine quality print on durable stock that could enjoy a lifetime of card games and handling.


How We Can Make it Real
To do it properly will cost £1,111. This covers the cost printing a quality deck, which must be made in a limited issue of 250 decks (a minimum quantity to make the project cost effective). This figure will also cover shipping, postage and costs of producing the gifts I offer to contributors below. 


Any donation (no matter how small) would be so gratefully received, and you can always help enormously simply by sharing links to this campaign on facebook or twitter. However... 

*a £5 donation secures the contributor an mp3 digital download of my 5 track album 'Kindness', which includes track 'St. James Bell' heard in the campaign video.




*a £10 donation secures the contributor a beautiful limited edition A5 print of the Queen of Clubs, signed with a personal message of thanks AND the digital download of my 5 track album 'Kindness', which includes track 'St. James Bell' heard in the campaign video.

The Faculty Led Travel

conducted in Paris, France for the month of June. As Ernest Hemingway once wrote to a friend, “If
you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you
go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable
feast.” Hemingway was one of many
American writers, artists, and intellectuals, who felt the pull of “the city of
light” and succumbed to its attractions and cosmopolitan environment. In this brief but intensive program, we
will explore most of the major sites and museums of Paris with an emphasis on
French art and culture. Classes will be conducted on-site in such places as the
Louvre, the Centre Pompidou, the Musée d’Orsay, the Musée Carnavalet, Shakespeare
&amp; Co., the gothic cathedrals of St. Denis and Notre Dame de Paris. With its many world-class museums, which
house objects that span the entire history of art, its abundance of cultural
landmarks, its many grand chateaus nearby, Paris has become a pilgrimage site,
a Mecca, for any serious student of the visual arts.<br/></p><h4>What is Needed:</h4><p>The course I will be taking is <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ARTHI 3828-01: A Moveable Feast: French

Through this campaign I hope to about raise half of the funds needed for the program. I am very grateful to have been awarded scholarships, grants, and loans in order to complete my education at the Kansas City Art Institute.

meeting them face to face years later and they seem so much more real. Being able to stand in front of many of the artworks I have studied in class has an unquantifiable value to me.

<p></p>
<div>
<p>I’m Maax.</p>
<p>Half of my
life I was working with children, learning, teaching and doing a lot of stuff
together. Maybe this is why I like toys, any types of toys, handmade and retail
ones, plastic, wood or rubber, action figures, minifigures, collectible sets, designer vinyl, and custom toys. Some
time ago I’ve got an idea to make my own do-it-yourself platform, blank toy.  </p>
<p>I did
several sketches on paper, few designs, until this little creature came to mind.</p>

<p>Hmmm… do
you know why we use a light bulb to illustrate an idea?</p>

<h4>Introducing Lumi!</h4>
<p>Lumi is
a modern mystical or magical creature, light spirit, body of light that simply brings
ideas to you. So if you need ideas just grab it and keep it closer. Empower it
with your own touch. Do you know already how your personal Lumi will look
like?</p>
<p>For true unbelievers,
those who don’t believe in fairytales or particularly in this storyline:  </p>
<p>Lumi is
a do-it-yourself platform toy, designed on paper (high technologies free), hand
sculpted (non 3D modeling product) and hand casted in plastic.</p>

<p><b>Здравствуйте,</b></p>
<p>Меня зовут Макс, по паспорту действительно Максимилиан. Большую
часть своей жизни я работаю с детьми, вероятно, здесь кроется мое увлечение
игрушками. Некоторое время назад, у меня появилась идея сделать свою
собственную дизайнерскую игрушку D.I.Y. платформу.  Много времени ушло на подготовку, менял дизайн…
пока это маленькое существо не появилось на свет.</p>
<p>LUMI– волшебное создание, которое вдохновляет и порождает идеи.
Может принимать любой облик. А в каком образе LUMI приходит к
вам, выбор за вами.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>                  ЧТО ЖЕ ТАКОЕ LUMI ???</b></p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>Я собираю средства для выпуска первой серии LUMI. Необходимо закупить
оптом материалы для изготовления и литья форм, дополнительное оборудование, сопутствующие расходные материалы.</p>
<p><b>Цель! </b></p>
<p>Выпуск дизайнерской D.I.Y. игрушки, созданной и производимой
в России, доступной и узнаваемой. Развитие дизайнерской виниловой игрушки как

<p>D.I.Y.  (от английского Do-it-yourselfсделай это сам). В нескольких словах, если мы говорим об
игрушках, то D.I.Y. это фигурка для раскрашивания. К
примеру, на Руси расписывали матрешки, в современном мире используют виниловые,
пластиковые фигурки разнообразных форм, как основу для
воплощения своих идей. Такие игрушки-фигурки можно раскрашивать карандашами, маркерами,
красками, их можно видоизменять, резать, пилить, сверлить, приклеивать или
лепить дополнительные детали. Такие работы становятся авторскими, уникальными
произведениями искусства. Игрушки превращаются в героев разных культур, кино,
мультфильмов и комиксов, а также в существующих или вымышленных персонажей, невиданных
существ от милых и добрых до страшных и ужасных. </p>
<p>Наверное, многие рисовали на бумаге, доске
для мела, стене или асфальте. Так вот дизайнерские игрушки – рисование на объемных
поверхностях.  </p>

I’m Maax.
Half of my
life I was working with children, learning, teaching and doing a lot of stuff
together. Maybe this is why I like toys, any types of toys, handmade and retail
ones, plastic, wood or rubber, action figures, minifigures, collectible sets, designer vinyl, and custom toys. Some
time ago I’ve got an idea to make my own do-it-yourself platform, blank toy.  
I did
several sketches on paper, few designs, until this little creature came to mind.
                                                        ***EUREKA***  
Hmmm… do
you know why we use a light bulb to illustrate an idea?



Introducing Lumi!
Lumi is
a modern mystical or magical creature, light spirit, body of light that simply brings
ideas to you. So if you need ideas just grab it and keep it closer. Empower it
with your own touch. Do you know already how your personal Lumi will look
like?
For true unbelievers,
those who don’t believe in fairytales or particularly in this storyline:  
Lumi is
a do-it-yourself platform toy, designed on paper (high technologies free), hand
sculpted (non 3D modeling product) and hand casted in plastic.






                Head in
the shape of a light bulb – here the ideas come from.   
                Articulated
arms.

               Lumi body - compatible to lightbulbs with E27 socle, so you can easily                  use a lightbulb instead of its head. 

              Hight:    135mm (  5,3"" )

Give it
your own unique design, draw on it, paint, modify, cut or drill or leave it as
it is. Have fun.





-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download LUMI template from the gallery --> Draw your design on this template --> Post it on Instagram with hashtag #lumicontest and @mxmilian --> Be ready to win and receive LUMI DIY! 
Help spread the word about LUMI Contest reposting this on facebook & instagram
I'll post all best creations here in the gallery and blog, shoutout on my instagram, and facebook page.

Where will the funds go

Your help and support will go for the first run of in-house production!


1.            Buying materials for molds and casting
2.           Equipment and tools
3.           Shipping costs
4.           Also I’m
planning to take part at the first COMICCON Russia which will be                held in Moscow
this autumn. And I will prepare some toys and get ready for it.




Здравствуйте,
Меня зовут Макс, по паспорту действительно Максимилиан. Большую
часть своей жизни я работаю с детьми, вероятно, здесь кроется мое увлечение
игрушками. Некоторое время назад, у меня появилась идея сделать свою
собственную дизайнерскую игрушку D.I.Y. платформу.  Много времени ушло на подготовку, менял дизайн…
пока это маленькое существо не появилось на свет.
LUMI– волшебное создание, которое вдохновляет и порождает идеи.
Может принимать любой облик. А в каком образе LUMI приходит к
вам, выбор за вами.

                  ЧТО ЖЕ ТАКОЕ LUMI ???

                  Это фигурка - талисман, которую раскрашивают. Люми - дизайнерская                           игрушка белого цвета, высотой 13 см.
Модель сделана вручную и в                                 дальнейшем вручную отливается из пластика.


Я собираю средства для выпуска первой серии LUMI. Необходимо закупить
оптом материалы для изготовления и литья форм, дополнительное оборудование, сопутствующие расходные материалы.
Цель! 
Выпуск дизайнерской D.I.Y. игрушки, созданной и производимой
в России, доступной и узнаваемой. Развитие дизайнерской виниловой игрушки как
направления в России.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Сохрани макет - контур Люми из галереи --> Придумай и нарисуй своего Люми на этом макете --> Выложи эскиз в Instagram с тэгом #lumicontest и @mxmilian --> Готовься к выигрышу фигурки Люми!
Помогите распространить информацию об этом конкурсе, участвовать могут все, взрослые и дети, друзья и знакомые. Разместите этот рисунок выше у себя в Facebook и Instagram.
Лучшие эскизы я опубликую здесь и в блоге, в своем instagram и facebook. Победитель получит белую фигурку Люми, для реализации своей идеи!

поверхностях.

</div></div>","From youth through 75 years I have devoted my life to - THE ARTS - as a dancer, painter oil on canvas and silk, and ceramics. ""SILK"" brings my over 40 years of silk work into a beautiful comprehensive form for friends, other artists, and the world to enjoy.

I have been informed that it will cost approximately $3,000 USD to produce.
The book is already in outline form and ready to proceed. 
If I don't reach the goal, the funds raised will still go to the book's production.

Beginnings

Having been taught to play with batik painting on fabric, my friend Alan Campbell……not the Dorothy Parker one……and I continued to play on.Alan, being  well situated socially and closet of friends with Sister Parish and Albert Hadley…two of New York’s LEADING decoratorsgave them gifts of our batik play.They loved ‘em and decided to give us a show in their office.Although novices, off we were on a lucrative business painting upholstery fabric for leading NY decorators with hot bees wax and dyes....if ever I should come down with sever lung problems, blame it onyears inhaling beeswax fumes

Refugio - The Refuge Art Studio - created by Emily K. Grieves</u></i></p>
<p><i><b>My artistic vision:</b></i> The desire and the opportunity to create artwork has been
one of the greatest gifts in my life. Art has saved me many times over,
allowing me shelter in times of darkness and blessing me with a way for joyous
expression in times of light. The creative process for me has always been
linked to inquiry into life’s meaning and purpose, and has taken me into realms
of understanding and inner knowledge I never could have imagined had I not
chosen to walk the art-making path.  While
my intention with my art-making is to create beauty in the world, that does not
necessarily mean making a pretty picture. Rather it means developing my
imagination and intuition and opening the eyes of my interior vision to see the
world as beautiful, to experience life as beautiful, to discover a way into
beauty and harmony and peace by shifting perspective and looking for light in
all the dark places. </p>
<p><i><b>Bringing the vision to the people of Teotihuacan:</b></i> Because people ask me all the time about my artwork and the
vision behind it, I recognized a need here in my community in Teotihuacan to
provide this type of experience in a guided studio setting.  Women and girls in particular have expressed
a need for a comfortable safe space in which to explore their own imagination
in a positive way, perhaps for the first time in their lives, and so it is my
intention to make that space available for them with gentle guided visioning
resulting in creating a painting following transformative step by step
instruction.  I am developing a small
commercial storefront we have available into an art studio that will provide
shelter and refuge from the storms of life, where people can come and relax
into their interior worlds for a couple hours, enjoy playing with color and
shape and texture, and learn how to tune into their own connection to the
source of their inspiration. This space will be called “Taller de Arte El
Refugio” … which translates to English as The Refuge Art Studio. This year I will complete training as an Intentional Creativity Coach and Intuitive Painting teacher in the Color of Woman method developed by Shiloh Sophia McCloud, and I'm excited to be able to offer this deeply healing creative process to the people here. </p>
<p><i><b>How you can help:</b></i> Thankfully I can provide this opportunity for a fairly minimal cost
to students, but I need your help to make it happen.  My immediate needs are for basic things like
a glass front sliding door, lighting, plumbing repairs, easels, shelving units,
tables and chairs, and basic communal art supplies. We are seeking donations to help cover the costs of these items.  My goal is to begin the first class on Sept. 22, so I'm working hard to make the place look beautiful and inspiring soon! Your generous donation to bringing art and consciousness opportunities
to the local population of Teotihuacan is deeply appreciated with heart-felt
gratitude! </p><p><i><b>To find out more about Emily and her art, please visit:  <a href=""www.EmilyKGrievesArt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.EmilyKGrievesArt.com</a></b></i></p><p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Taller de Arte El

Art Basel is the leading contemporary art fair in the world. With 150 members, Con Artist is one of the largest and most active artist collectives in New York City. Our mission is to exhibit at Art Basel for the first time this year, and we need your help to do it.
Con Artist is a collective workspace and gallery in the Lower East Side of NYC, a gritty neighborhood with a notoriously punk rock history. We’ve been growing for the past four years, hosting new exhibitions every three weeks and partnering with other organizations like CultureFIX, Chashama and Recession Art. Recently the space doubled: we added a street-level gallery and storefront upstairs from our underground studio.
It’s easy to get lost on the contemporary art scene, especially in NYC. But Con Artist Collective represents an incredibly important demographic, eager and emerging artists. We refuse to be lost. We are the ones working all day and through the night , fighting for the space and attention our work deserves. So we couldn’t help but build a support system, a creative infrastructure. 
All donations will help us break even on expenses (shown below), and will be reciprocated with acknowledgement, gifts, and a lasting relationship with a remarkable network. If you’re part of a company or organization, we’d love to discuss a customized promotional exchange.

For nearly 15 years, Jess Curtis/Gravity has been
captivating audiences the world over with body-based performance art using a
variety of disciplines including contemporary dance, physical theater, live
music, and aerial acrobatics. Founder and Artistic Director, Jess Curtis, has
created a body of work ranging from the underground extremes of Mission
District Warehouses with Contraband and CORE (1985-1998) to the formal
refinement and exuberance of European State Theaters and Circus Tents with
Compagnie Cahin-Caha (1992-2002) and
Jess Curtis/Gravity (2000-present).Jess Curtis, Artistic Director, GravityDually-based in San Francisco and Berlin, Jess
Curtis/Gravity aspires to the creation of exceptionally engaging body-based art
that explores and addresses issues and ideas of substance and relevance to a
broad popular public.
What We Are Doing
We are raising funds for the US premiere of Performance Research Experiment #2.2 (PRE#2.2),
January 30 - February 1, 2014 at the Joe Goode Annex in San Francisco, CA. PRE#2.2 is the latest phase of our Performance Research
Experiment, an ongoing performance project attempting to marry art and science
- questioning and quantifying the physical effects of artistic performance on
the body.
In an era where software updates to applications have become
ubiquitous and necessary in order to pursue optimal operating efficiency and
seamless user experience, we are rolling out a sinewy revamp of a piece that
came to life this past spring in both SF and Berlin. Over the past several
months, we have significantly reconfigured the work to provide a more seamless
and theatrical user experience.Jess, Jörg, and Yoann testing media integration in PRE#2.2 PRE#2.2 features Gravity Artistic Director and Performer

 to “SKIN:<strong> </strong>A<strong> </strong>Meditation”. Our project began a few years ago when I 
voiced to Julia my interest in creating a visual interpretation of one 
of her poems. I had just finished working on another visual arts film 
and was inspired to begin another collaboration.</div><div>Not long 
after mentioning my idea, Julia handed me a poem she had written 
when traveling to the midwest. The poem was titled “SKIN” and it’s 
subject matter was the story of her living with Melanoma and recalling the experience of healing after her first surgery. I realized that this poem’s 
subject would make a compelling and thought-provoking film.<br/><br/>Little did we know the journey we were about to embark on.<br/><br/>SKIN,
 has now become a project that is gaining momentum and generating 
excitement. Timothy Cramer, Kimia Rahgozar and Jose Vargas have jumped 
on board to work with us because they share our belief that SKIN can 
have a powerful impact on all those that experience it.<br/><br/>Larendee

 centerpiece of the installation is a film diptych of Julia Knight’s 
poetry supported by Timothy Cramer's sound design. A gallery 
of photographs (some of which are included in the film) by Kimia 
Rahgozar, will be shown in a separate room.<br/><br/>SKIN will be also be experienced through interactive elements:<br/><br/>Video
 selfies will be displayed on monitors in the space. We are using social
 media as a tool to ask individuals to send in a 10 second soundbite 
expressing how they feel about their skin. Twenty (20) submissions will 
be selected for inclusion in our installation.<br/><br/>Writing boards will be hung in the space prompting people to express “How they live in their skin.”<b><b><br/><br/><b>WHAT WE NEED</b> <br/><br/></b></b>Our
 goal is to raise $25,000. This seed money will be put towards securing a

 business expertise in helping us strategize the project.We have also created a Board of Directors for SKIN which now has 3 members.WHAT IS SKIN: A MeditationSKIN
 is a multi-media installation combining film, poetry, photography, 
surround sound and interactive elements which invite the viewer to 
immerse themselves into an environmental meditation.
We want to blur the line that creates division between 
people based on age, race, and gender as we seek to continue a dialogue 
about self-respect and perception.NUTS AND BOLTS The
 centerpiece of the installation is a film diptych of Julia Knight’s 
poetry supported by Timothy Cramer's sound design. A gallery 
of photographs (some of which are included in the film) by Kimia 
Rahgozar, will be shown in a separate room.SKIN will be also be experienced through interactive elements:Video
 selfies will be displayed on monitors in the space. We are using social
 media as a tool to ask individuals to send in a 10 second soundbite 
expressing how they feel about their skin. Twenty (20) submissions will 
be selected for inclusion in our installation.Writing boards will be hung in the space prompting people to express “How they live in their skin.”WHAT WE NEED Our
 goal is to raise $25,000. This seed money will be put towards securing a
 NYC gallery, completing the surround sound design and executing a 
digital media strategy. OUR MISSION — “THE NEW NORMAL”See and appreciate those around youKindness and respect towards othersInside and out, we love all SKINNecessary

<h3>An Art and Music Project to Benefit Northeastern Japan produced by TokyoDex</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/678448/pictures/full/20130225193201-MINIslide_crossover3.jpg?1361849528"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>An Art Project to Revitalize the Community</h3>
<p>On 3/11/2011, the Tohoku region of Japan was changed forever by a colossal earthquake, tsunami, and the nuclear disaster that ensued. Nearly two years later, the region remains in shock and in need of support. While volunteers from all over Japan remain in the area to help survivors, the need for physical labor has dwindled and volunteers are looking to find new ways to best support local communities. The physical cleanup process is nearly complete, but life is by no means back to normal and spirits remain low. What is needed now is community outreach designed to energize people and celebrate life, rather than focusing on the disaster. The Tohoku Artist Caravan project produced by TokyoDex is exactly that.</p>
<p>The Artist Caravan will bring artists and musicians from all over Japan, and all over the world, to gather in the town of Karakuwa, Kesennuma to bring a much-needed cultural infusion to the area. This will be the beginning of a long-term art project designed to get locals involved and to bring visitors from across Japan, raising awareness and building the local economy. The initial art installations will be completed over a three-day period, culminating in an opening party that features many renowned musicians across multiple genres. This entire process will be filmed and include first-hand accounts from locals as well as participating artists to document the experience and help raise awareness of the current situation of a largely forgotten region that has fallen out of the news cycle.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/646299/pictures/full/20130204005631-8407051837_d0215d9610_o.jpg?1359968194"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Karakuwa Artscape</h3>
<p>One of the most striking comments we heard when visiting Karakuwa was about the “impenetrable gray” that has pervaded the landscape since the disaster. When the tsunami swallowed up whole districts of Karakuwa, it washed much of the town’s color out to sea, and even with the rubble removed and the town slowly recovering, the landscape remains bleak. The main initiative of the Tohoku Artist Caravan will be the “Karakuwa ArtScape,” an ongoing art initiative that will add color to the community and change the landscape in a powerful way. The artists we bring to Karakuwa will create several murals at various high-visibility areas that are also symbolic within the community. These large-scale works of art will not only serve as a memorial to the disaster, but also become beacons of hope for the future, beginning a permanent outdoor art exhibition that would be a powerful draw for tourism. Karakuwa ArtScape could be added to and updated on a periodic basis to really put the town of Karakuwa on the map as a cultural center. It would bring outside visitors, and their financial support, to the area for years to come.</p>
<h3>Why Karakuwa</h3>
<p>Karakuwa is a small town that is located on the eastern side of Kesennuma in the Prefecture of Miyagi that suffered a great deal of damage as a result of the 2011 Great Eastern Earthquake Tsunami. However, because of Karakuwa's relative small size and geographically isolated location on a small peninsula, it was largely overlooked immediately after the disaster. The very first responders for Karakuwa were actually US Navy. Karakuwa was fortunate to have many volunteers to assist in recovery and relief efforts, but the numbers didn't compare to many of the bigger cities across Tohoku. </p>

<p><strong>1. Oyster Processing Facility in Shibitachi</strong></p>
<p>Shibitachi is a coastal area in Karakuwa known for its fishing industry. “Moriya-suisan,” an Oyster business run by local resident Ichiyo Kanno, was completely destroyed in the tsunami and rebuilt last year. The land that the facility stands on today is where some of her employees use to live. Their houses were destroyed and many lives were lost. Working extremely hard to rebuild her business, this year Ichiyo-san is finally able to process oysters again. But Shibitachi is still completely grey, and the once-lively town remains devastated. Bringing in artists to add some color to her newly reopened business will provide some much-needed color as well as hope for the future.</p>

<p><strong>2. “Kaeru-Juku”</strong></p>
<p>On 3/11, Kuniaki Baba lost his home which he built out of wood that was passed down from his mother, including pillars several hundred years old. He now lives in a small hut next to the lot where his home used to stand and has always opened his doors to house relief volunteers. The hut has been nicknamed “Kaeru-Juku,” (“Return House”), reflecting Baba-san’s open-door policy for all past volunteers who might wish to return to Karakuwa.</p>

<h3 class=""p1"">Energizing Local Youth and Planning for the Future</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/717458/pictures/full/20130321202749-ArtistCaravan_06.jpg?1363922875"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the most positive stories to emerge from the devastation that took place in 2011 was the powerful volunteer movement that emerged in the wake of the disaster.Thousands of young people quit whatever they were doing at the time to dive into the Tohoku area and make themselves useful in anyway possible-- removing rubble, cooking food, and providing care however they could. In 2013, the heavy lifting is over, but many of these young people have remained in local communities where they continue to be catalysts of change.This phenomenon was palpable in Karakuwa, where many residents described how this infusion of young people from outside their community had reenergized the town. They explained how they provided not only much-needed extra hands in the clean-up process, but also acted as role models that gave hope and purpose to local youth who were feeling defeated and at a loss as to how to move forward.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The “Karakuwa Rookies” is an initiative started by those volunteers who have remained in Karakuwa.They understand that the young people of the community are key to revitalization, and they have become the “glue” that bonds the local youth of Karakuwa together. One of their main goals in to get young locals to be become more involved in the community, to participate in local festivals and other gatherings, and to proactively plan for the future.The Kawakuwa Rookies have pledged their support to the Artist Caravan project, and in return, we will pledge a percentage of all funds raised to this group so that they may continue to do their good work and invest in the future of Karakuwa long after the Artist Caravan leaves town.</p>

<h3 class=""p1"">Opening Party: “Reunion”</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/717497/pictures/original/20130321204446-ArtistCaravan_09.jpg?1363923885"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""p1"">When discussing various benefit events that had already taken place in the area, we learned that one of the most memorable ones was a visit from the internationally renowned taiko ensemble, Kodo. As fate would have it, Artist Caravan core team member D.H. Rosen has a long history with the Kodo drummers and a close personal relationship with members past and present, including a former member who was born and raised in Kesennuma. Assembling a group of former Kodo members to play together is something that has never been done before and would make for an incredible gathering of musicians who have already proved popular with the Karakuwa community. The opening party for this exhibition will take place in Kesenuma proper (venue to be determined) and will act as a celebratory kick-off and a vehicle to garner traffic to Karakuwa ArtScape.</p>
<p class=""p1"">(Participation by former Kodo members Ryutaro Kaneko,Tetsuro Naito, Kaoru Watanabe,Takahito Nishino, Tsubasa Hori, Natsuki Saito, confirmed as of 2/24/2013.)</p>

</div></div>","Tohoku Artist Caravan 2013
An Art and Music Project to Benefit Northeastern Japan produced by TokyoDex

 
An Art Project to Revitalize the Community
On 3/11/2011, the Tohoku region of Japan was changed forever by a colossal earthquake, tsunami, and the nuclear disaster that ensued. Nearly two years later, the region remains in shock and in need of support. While volunteers from all over Japan remain in the area to help survivors, the need for physical labor has dwindled and volunteers are looking to find new ways to best support local communities. The physical cleanup process is nearly complete, but life is by no means back to normal and spirits remain low. What is needed now is community outreach designed to energize people and celebrate life, rather than focusing on the disaster. The Tohoku Artist Caravan project produced by TokyoDex is exactly that.
The Artist Caravan will bring artists and musicians from all over Japan, and all over the world, to gather in the town of Karakuwa, Kesennuma to bring a much-needed cultural infusion to the area. This will be the beginning of a long-term art project designed to get locals involved and to bring visitors from across Japan, raising awareness and building the local economy. The initial art installations will be completed over a three-day period, culminating in an opening party that features many renowned musicians across multiple genres. This entire process will be filmed and include first-hand accounts from locals as well as participating artists to document the experience and help raise awareness of the current situation of a largely forgotten region that has fallen out of the news cycle.

Karakuwa Artscape
One of the most striking comments we heard when visiting Karakuwa was about the “impenetrable gray” that has pervaded the landscape since the disaster. When the tsunami swallowed up whole districts of Karakuwa, it washed much of the town’s color out to sea, and even with the rubble removed and the town slowly recovering, the landscape remains bleak. The main initiative of the Tohoku Artist Caravan will be the “Karakuwa ArtScape,” an ongoing art initiative that will add color to the community and change the landscape in a powerful way. The artists we bring to Karakuwa will create several murals at various high-visibility areas that are also symbolic within the community. These large-scale works of art will not only serve as a memorial to the disaster, but also become beacons of hope for the future, beginning a permanent outdoor art exhibition that would be a powerful draw for tourism. Karakuwa ArtScape could be added to and updated on a periodic basis to really put the town of Karakuwa on the map as a cultural center. It would bring outside visitors, and their financial support, to the area for years to come.
Why Karakuwa
Karakuwa is a small town that is located on the eastern side of Kesennuma in the Prefecture of Miyagi that suffered a great deal of damage as a result of the 2011 Great Eastern Earthquake Tsunami. However, because of Karakuwa's relative small size and geographically isolated location on a small peninsula, it was largely overlooked immediately after the disaster. The very first responders for Karakuwa were actually US Navy. Karakuwa was fortunate to have many volunteers to assist in recovery and relief efforts, but the numbers didn't compare to many of the bigger cities across Tohoku.

Relief Volunteers in Karakuwa
 
Karakuwa ArtScape: Initial Sites
We have already received permission to create murals on two properties in Karakuwa

1. Oyster Processing Facility in Shibitachi
Shibitachi is a coastal area in Karakuwa known for its fishing industry. “Moriya-suisan,” an Oyster business run by local resident Ichiyo Kanno, was completely destroyed in the tsunami and rebuilt last year. The land that the facility stands on today is where some of her employees use to live. Their houses were destroyed and many lives were lost. Working extremely hard to rebuild her business, this year Ichiyo-san is finally able to process oysters again. But Shibitachi is still completely grey, and the once-lively town remains devastated. Bringing in artists to add some color to her newly reopened business will provide some much-needed color as well as hope for the future.
 

2. “Kaeru-Juku”
On 3/11, Kuniaki Baba lost his home which he built out of wood that was passed down from his mother, including pillars several hundred years old. He now lives in a small hut next to the lot where his home used to stand and has always opened his doors to house relief volunteers. The hut has been nicknamed “Kaeru-Juku,” (“Return House”), reflecting Baba-san’s open-door policy for all past volunteers who might wish to return to Karakuwa.
 
Energizing Local Youth and Planning for the Future

One of the most positive stories to emerge from the devastation that took place in 2011 was the powerful volunteer movement that emerged in the wake of the disaster.Thousands of young people quit whatever they were doing at the time to dive into the Tohoku area and make themselves useful in anyway possible-- removing rubble, cooking food, and providing care however they could. In 2013, the heavy lifting is over, but many of these young people have remained in local communities where they continue to be catalysts of change.This phenomenon was palpable in Karakuwa, where many residents described how this infusion of young people from outside their community had reenergized the town. They explained how they provided not only much-needed extra hands in the clean-up process, but also acted as role models that gave hope and purpose to local youth who were feeling defeated and at a loss as to how to move forward.
The “Karakuwa Rookies” is an initiative started by those volunteers who have remained in Karakuwa.They understand that the young people of the community are key to revitalization, and they have become the “glue” that bonds the local youth of Karakuwa together. One of their main goals in to get young locals to be become more involved in the community, to participate in local festivals and other gatherings, and to proactively plan for the future.The Kawakuwa Rookies have pledged their support to the Artist Caravan project, and in return, we will pledge a percentage of all funds raised to this group so that they may continue to do their good work and invest in the future of Karakuwa long after the Artist Caravan leaves town.
 
Opening Party: “Reunion”

When discussing various benefit events that had already taken place in the area, we learned that one of the most memorable ones was a visit from the internationally renowned taiko ensemble, Kodo. As fate would have it, Artist Caravan core team member D.H. Rosen has a long history with the Kodo drummers and a close personal relationship with members past and present, including a former member who was born and raised in Kesennuma. Assembling a group of former Kodo members to play together is something that has never been done before and would make for an incredible gathering of musicians who have already proved popular with the Karakuwa community. The opening party for this exhibition will take place in Kesenuma proper (venue to be determined) and will act as a celebratory kick-off and a vehicle to garner traffic to Karakuwa ArtScape.
(Participation by former Kodo members Ryutaro Kaneko,Tetsuro Naito, Kaoru Watanabe,Takahito Nishino, Tsubasa Hori, Natsuki Saito, confirmed as of 2/24/2013.)
 
The Website

The Artist Caravan website will be a “home base” for the project, designed to give general information about the project, and also to track the progress of the caravan in real time once the journey begins. This frequently updated website will include “check-ins” and photos of the journey along the way, as well as featuring an interactive map that indicates where the caravan is at any given time. Facebook and Twitter feeds embedded in the site itself will allow viewers to interact online with Caravan travelers and be a part of the experience.

I received a degree in Studio Art from Saint Louis University and have been working as an artist and doing other small jobs since graduating. My work has been featured in many different venues and shows in the area including, Naughty Gras, Saint Louis Art Fair, Laumeir Art Fair, Koken Art Factory, and Mad Art Gallery. In addition to working on projects for these shows I make custom artwork and have been working on a few ideas for comic books. Progress on current works and projects can be seen on my facebook page. The nitty gritty of this project is to be able to raise funds for a move into a new place where I will have more space to create. In addition funds will also go to a new scanner from which I will be able to archive my work better, and be able to print archival quality prints. What We Need & What You GetI have been drawing my whole life and being able to have time and space to do my art is something that is very special to me. While I have had successes with my art work so far, I am just starting my career as an artist. With more funding I can take more time to focus on my art which is the most important thing in my life. For donating I will be giving out some of my own work both as prints and as originals. At higher levels there is even the option of custom work.  Here are some examples of the type of work I do.

<p>With the ability to create your own character, the Dragon Age series offers players the chance to craft their own unique adventure. Many fans take that a step further, exploring their Wardens and Inquisitors through art, fanfic, comics, and more.

<p>Lauren Ashizawa and Caitlin Scannell are both comic artists who spend maybe a little too much time drawing fanart of their Lavellans and coming up with Dalish headcanons. When they’re not crying over elves, Caitlin runs a space age fantasy comic, Heir Presumptive, and Lauren runs a high fantasy comic called Innkeeps. They both self-publish their work and regularly exhibit at comic conventions across the US and Canada.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The major risk we face in this campaign is not hitting our funding goal, and being unable to cover printing costs as well as not being able to donate our goal of $3,750 USD to the ACLU. Though this is a little larger scale than we're used to, being indie comic artists means both of the editors are familiar with book production and printing. The majority of artist cards and codex entries are already completed, and the rest should be completed before the campaign wraps up. There's always a chance for delays in production, including shipping delays and proof adjustments, and we intend to keep both backers and contributors updated in the event of any setbacks.</p>
<p>In the event that the campaign is not fully funded, we have chosen the flexible funding option to ensure both the backers and the contributors receive their copies of the books and other rewards. We will do a smaller run of the books with a company called RA Comics Direct, which both editors regularly use print our own comics, though this will make the cost per unit slightly higher and we won't be able to reach our initial donation goal of $3750 for the ACLU.</p>

<h3>Why go to Vidcon 2017?</h3>
<p>My name is Ian Garland and I am the Off Kilter Crafter on Youtube. I have been making Youtube videos for the past 3 years and have built my channel from the ground up. I have had great opportunities that have helped my channel grow to almost 5,000 subscribers. I chose the name Off Kilter Crafter because no matter how hard I try, my cards are never perfect. So instead, I embrace the imperfections and make each project my own. The reason I want to go Vidcon is it will expand my horizons and give me experience, knowledge, information, connections, and friends who will help my Youtube channel grow. I am currently a smaller channel, and hope to bring back to my channel all that I learn at Vidcon. I will also have the opportunity to attend panels, Q&amp;As, and activities. All of which will build my skills and create better Youtube content. With the support I receive I can bring it back around to you in my videos. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get In Return:</h3>
<p>Here are the expenses I need help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare</li>
<li>Hotel</li>
<li>Food/Snacks</li>
<li>Transportation To/From Airport</li>
<li>Disneyland day for creators</li>
</ul>
<p>In return I have several perks for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5: A thank you email from me for your support.</li>
<li>$25: Behind the scenes access to a secret Facebook group for Facebook Live events, access to raw YouTube footage from each day.*  </li>
<li>$40: Special Vidcon SVG file and post card from Vidcon.</li>
<li>$65: One of a kind Off Kilter Crafter Tote Bag.</li>
<li>$100: One of a kind Off Kilter Crafter T-shirt.</li>
<li>$250: I will make a 10 pack of one layer cards for you to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Subject to Wi-Fi availability.</p>
<p>Any left over funds I will use those for  a contingency fund to have with me while at Vidcon. Once back home, I will use any left over money to help buy new video equipment for better camera shots, as well as crafting supplies and/or tools. Those products will then be helpful tools for my future videos.</p>

</div></div>","Why go to Vidcon 2017?
My name is Ian Garland and I am the Off Kilter Crafter on Youtube. I have been making Youtube videos for the past 3 years and have built my channel from the ground up. I have had great opportunities that have helped my channel grow to almost 5,000 subscribers. I chose the name Off Kilter Crafter because no matter how hard I try, my cards are never perfect. So instead, I embrace the imperfections and make each project my own. The reason I want to go Vidcon is it will expand my horizons and give me experience, knowledge, information, connections, and friends who will help my Youtube channel grow. I am currently a smaller channel, and hope to bring back to my channel all that I learn at Vidcon. I will also have the opportunity to attend panels, Q&As, and activities. All of which will build my skills and create better Youtube content. With the support I receive I can bring it back around to you in my videos. 

What I Need & What You Get In Return:
Here are the expenses I need help with:

Airfare
Hotel
Food/Snacks
Transportation To/From Airport
Disneyland day for creators

In return I have several perks for you:

$5: A thank you email from me for your support.
$25: Behind the scenes access to a secret Facebook group for Facebook Live events, access to raw YouTube footage from each day.*  
$40: Special Vidcon SVG file and post card from Vidcon.
$65: One of a kind Off Kilter Crafter Tote Bag.
$100: One of a kind Off Kilter Crafter T-shirt.
$250: I will make a 10 pack of one layer cards for you to use.

*Subject to Wi-Fi availability.
Any left over funds I will use those for  a contingency fund to have with me while at Vidcon. Once back home, I will use any left over money to help buy new video equipment for better camera shots, as well as crafting supplies and/or tools. Those products will then be helpful tools for my future videos.

<p>We are told that the country is divided. The divide I find most complex and interesting is the line we draw between local individual identity, and global identity. I am hard-pressed to find someone who feels rightfully represented by our mass media dialogue, yet, when it comes to understanding other groups and individuals, mainstream social and corporate media sources provide most of our knowledge. As individuals we are sorted, categorized and fictionalized by mainstream dialogues. Local identity is globalized through the exchange of digital media, and meanwhile these global narratives also materialize locally, in the forms of laws, mailboxes, protests, Home Depot gardens and Bikram Yoga studios. My project aims to explore the material interface that negotiates this encounter between global and local identity. I will do so, in part, by using objects to activate new channels of long distance, personal communication. The goal is to draw attention to the ways materials engage in their own political dialogues and express their own global concerns. I want to focus on communication that lives 'in the flesh' rather than in the cloud.  </p>
<p>The highway will be my avenue. I'll be driving south from the Bay Area and then heading east, spending time in settlements of every sort--cities, towns, parks, ghost towns, ruins and truck stops. My only plan is to meet people and carry out my directives. </p>
<p>The directives are sponsored by Donors. When you donate you acknowledge your multiple personalities: subject, object and enzyme. You will choose a perk that directly influences the direction and content of my journey, and that also activates some aspect of your identity in an unplanned future location. Most of the perk options put you in direct social-material dialogue with a distant place. </p>
<p>I believe a more humane world depends directly upon a more honest approach to the way we connect to and extend through the materials around us--food, roads, forests, trash, toys, coins, etc. Global warming, resource scarcity, extinction and oil wars all result from our unwillingness to reconsider our relationship with our physical environments. Our focus on humans as the only 'active,' 'thinking,' 'choice making,' and 'valuing' entities, limits an honest approach to the way objects and media act through and upon our choices and character. This is an ecological, political and philosophical endeavor to look for vitality in objects. While it will sound to many like indulgence in a fantasy, I agree with Timothy Morton when he writes, ""the lineage that brought us slavery and racism is also the lineage that brought us the anthropocentric boundary between human and nonhuman."" It may be very worth while to look beyond these boundaries. </p>

It is an evolution of Minimarket, which was first held at Konstnärshuset in 2006. Over the years SUPERMARKET has grown into the biggest art fair in the Nordic countries featuring hundreds of artists from all over the world.</p>

We are asking for $2000 to produce a professional-quality catalog for our exhibition. We need anywhere between 3 and 5 thousand dollars to produce our catalog. Through various fundraisers and with the help of some generous organizations we are most of the way there. We need your help to put us over the top. 
The funds we raise will go to the printing and distribution of our exhibition catalog. Any extra fund will be distributed among the group for art supplies and materials.
Your contributions will get you anything from catalogs to unique pieces of artwork from the members of our cohort.

<h3><u>What is the project?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>This is a national community arts project that will creatively link charities responding to addiction or homelessness in Manchester, Bristol, Canterbury, Newcastle and Birmingham.</h3>

<p><strong>The Political History of Smack and Crack </strong>is a theatre show inspired by the writer’s own experience in jail and rehab. It is an epic love-song to a lost generation following Neil and Mandy through the heroin epidemic of the Thatcher years.</p>
<p>After the riots of 1981, smack, and in its wake crack, became rife in urban areas, enchanting both the vulnerable and the disillusioned through both addiction and crime. This echoes even now with people affected still accessing support from charities across the country such as the Mustard Tree and the Men’s Room in Manchester, Bristol Drug Project, SIFA Fireside in Birmingham, Catching Lives in Canterbury and Skylight Crisis in Newcastle.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with all these charities over the last few months to develop a project to creatively link service users at these charities in remembering the riots of 1981 through a national art project. Especially as we now approach its 40-year anniversary next year.</p>
<p>Art workshops will take place at these charities and participating service users will be supported to co-create a new artwork, which will be influenced by the themes and content of <strong>The Political History of Smack and Crack</strong>.</p>
<p>Written by Ed Edwards, this acclaimed production is about two long-term addicts charting their lives from the Moss Side riots in 1981 through the heroin epidemic that followed to the present day in Manchester. The show will be on a national tour between 21st January and 22nd February.</p>
<p>Using <strong>The Political History of Smack and Crack </strong>as inspiration, participants will create their own artistic response to these issues on an A5 Art Tile. Throughout the tour, more and more Art Tiles will be created and the collection will be displayed in each theatre venue as a collage of individual responses that make up the whole artwork and the participants will be invited to see the play for free.</p>
<p>Once the tour is over, the artworks we will make digital copies of the Art Tiles. The original Art Tiles will be returned to the artists and, <i>if we raise enough money</i>, we will produce high-quality prints of the whole collection which will be gifted to each participating charity for exhibition.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We have already secured Arts Council funding for the touring production and we are asking for your support to reach our £1300 target so that we can achieve the ambition of this national community arts project.</p>
<p>We will incur the following costs, which we are asking for your help towards:</p>
<p>£175 fee for the work of experienced facilitators in each of the 4 participating locations</p>
<p>£60 for the materials used at each of these workshop including the blank Art Tiles</p>
<p>£500 for the scanning of the original artworks and printing of high-quality prints</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><u>Why are we doing this?</u></p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>The Political History of Smack and Crack </strong>performed for 13 nights at the charity Mustard Tree in Manchester, who have been combating poverty and preventing homelessness across Greater Manchester since 1994. These performances were part of the International Arts and Homelessness Festival curated by <a href=""http://with-one-voice.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">With One Voice</a>.</p>

<p>During these performances, the play connected with many people who had experience of homelessness and related drug dependency issues; people who rarely see their experiences represented on stage in an accessible way. We also provided numerous opportunities for creative community engagement during that time, including writing sessions, drama workshops and performance opportunities. The response to this from participants was fantastic!</p>
<p>Remounting the play for a national tour, we felt it was imperative to work with Mustard Tree again to support their vital work and we wanted to develop a new creative project that partnered the play. With the production touring the UK, we felt it was a great opportunity to connect with other organisations like Mustard Tree in other cities.</p>
<p>We are delivering this national arts project in order to engage with more people with experience of the play’s issues. We want to provide opportunities for creative expression and have that proudly exhibited in major venues alongside people with similar experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already raised much of the funding from other sources such as an Arts Council England grant. Everything has been fully costed and budgeted.</p>
<p>We have identified and engaged with amazing facilitators in each location to support the delivery of this work and ensure the wellbeing of all participants. We have ensured that each facilitator has ample experience of working with vulnerable adults as well as a passion for this particular project.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are working closely with each of the participating charities to encourage their clients to be involved, support the project in the workshop and ensure the participants' wellbeing. The charities involved are all very well established and have a track record of delivering creative programmes for their clients. The charities include:</p>

Each artist has contributed their unique style to the calendar, with mediums ranging from film photography and digital art to watercolor and wool painting. While each piece is unique, they all share roses as a central theme. This one-of-a-kind calendar is only available through this fundraiser, which supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in their search for a cure.</p><h3>Cystic Fibrosis and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</h3><p>Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic disease that affects more than 70,000 people worldwide. When a person has two mutated copies of the CFTR gene, the mucus in their lungs and digestive system becomes very thick and sticky. This mucus creates a perfect breeding ground for bacteria in the lungs, causing chronic infections and permanent lung damage. The thick mucus can also make it more difficult for the body to absorb nutrients, leading to malnutrition and problems gaining weight. Over time, cystic fibrosis can impact the liver, the pancreas, bone density, fertility, and much more.</p><p>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is the leading nonprofit organization that supports people with cystic fibrosis and their families in the United States. Their mission statement is “to cure cystic fibrosis and to provide all people with the disease the opportunity to lead full, productive lives by funding research and drug development, promoting individualized treatment, and ensuring access to high-quality, specialized care.” The life expectancy of people born with cystic fibrosis has doubled in the past thirty years, in large part due to the work of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Your contribution to this fundraiser will directly improve the quality of life of people living with cystic fibrosis and support the search for a life-saving cure.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about cystic fibrosis and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, you may visit their website at <a href=""http://www.cff.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cff.org</a>.</p><h3>Budget Breakdown</h3><p>For each $30 contribution, approximately $14-$17 will be donated to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; the exact amount depends on several factors, which are explained below. The rest of the money will be spent on three major expenses: printing the calendar, paying IndieGoGo platform and credit card fees, and paying the artists who created the calendar. (Shipping costs are charged separately so that more money from each contribution can be donated.)</p><p>The calendars will be professionally printed by <a href=""http://smartpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Smartpress</a> on 100# glossy paper, and the pages will be saddle stitched together for a smooth look. The cost per calendar will depend on how many donations we receive: the more calendars we order, the cheaper each calendar will be to print.</p><table style=""width:100%;"">

My daughter's diagnosis took me by surprise, and while it has definitely brought its fair share of challenges, it has also led me to a thriving online community I otherwise never would have found: the community of people who live with cystic fibrosis and the people who love them. Their support in the early days of my daughter's diagnosis inspired me to give back to the community, and so the “Cystic FibRoses” calendar was born. As my daughter grows up, I hope to inspire her to likewise give back to her communities in ways both big and small.</p><p>I am the behind-the-scenes organizer who coordinates the creative team's efforts and manages the logistics of the fundraiser.

Making the donation directly has two benefits: your donation will be tax-deductible, and 100% of your donation will go to the organization (rather than IndieGoGo fees).How can I help, other than by purchasing a calendar?Help us spread the word about this fundraiser! You can follow and share our Facebook page (fb.me/cfrosescalendar), print out a flyer to hang at your school or workplace (goo.gl/F1284R), and (the best approach of all) personally reach out to people who you think would love this calendar and this cause and invite them to order a calendar.Does the calendar include any holidays or other days of interest?No. To make the calendar equally appealing to an international audience, we chose not to print them with any national holidays, religious holidays, or other days of interest. However, orders shipping within the United States will include a list of federal holidays in 2019 so that you can easily write them in yourself if desired.Why did you choose roses as the theme for the calendar?To learn more about the connection between roses and cystic fibrosis, visit www.cff.org/About-Us/About-the-Cystic-Fibrosis-Foundation/The-65-Roses-Story.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, I am <strong>Dr Galaxo Magic</strong>.  My wife, <strong>Kai'om</strong>, and I are bringing back the <strong>Bi-Polar Express</strong> for a fifth year at <strong>Burning Man</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been building or running <i>Mutant Vehicles</i> at <strong>Burning Man</strong> since 2001.   In 2014 we decided to build a MV that would ride up on a trailer and The <strong>Bi-Polar Express (BPE) </strong>was born. <br/><br/>Each year we have made improvements and this year is no different.  New paint, new lighting, new gennie box, two new tires and a new generator.  We are also having to rent a truck to pull the <strong>BPE</strong> and trailer to the Burn or spend $1500-2000 to fix our present tow vehicle.  <br/><br/>While we absorb the greatest amount of the financial responsibility, we are hoping that our friends, family, and fellow Burners and lovers of art can help us cover some of these expenses.  <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need two new tires, a generator to run the lights, steam, and music, and we need to rent a truck or fix ours to transport the train to the playa.</p>
<p>We also plan to repaint the majority of the base train and touch up some of the wonderful art on the train.  And build a generator box to baffle the sound.</p>
<p>New paint, new lighting, new Gennie box, two new tires and a new generator.  We are also having to rent a truck to pull the <strong>BPE</strong> and trailer to the Burn.  </p>
<p>If we reach past our goal we will have even more lights and goodies to add.  </p>
<p>There are Perks available for your donations, including beautiful and colorful <strong>Bi-Polar Express</strong> patches!</p>
<p>We will be offering up a three hour tour for up to 7 campmates during Burn Week!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>Bi-Polar Express</strong> adds to the art fabric of this magical art festival.  The train can hold up to a 10 folks and we give free rides to everyone that comes along if there is any room at all!  We love the wonderful comments we get from fellow Burners and meeting new people every year  making new friends for life!</p>
</div><div>
<p>I have successfully built and been involved with seven different <i>Mutant Vehicles</i> (artcars) at <strong>Burning Man</strong> and the <strong>Bi-Polar Express</strong> has the benefit of being able to go to parades and events in the default world!  Your help will continue to make this possible.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle we face this year is simply getting the train to the event.  We will get it there, we always do, but my truck has been to 14 Burns and is in need of extensive repairs including a new radiator and tires.  Therefore, we may find it necessary to rent a tow vehicle to pull the train over the Sierras.</p>
<p>The second biggest hurdle is getting a generator that can handle all the power we need.  Minimum generator need would be 2000w.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your help, I think we can achieve all of our goals.  We would also appreciate your help in letting other folks know about our campaign.<br/><br/>Thank you and stay dusty my friends,<br/><strong>Dr. Galaxo Magic and Kai'om</strong></p>

My old machine died today and while I backed it up and should still have my files, I can't access any of them until I get a new computer with a working hard drive.  For better or for worse, my life depends on having a working computer. By helping me purchase a new one, you will allow me to continue to do commissions for people, color the graphic novel project I am in the middle of, finish Volume 1 of Briar Hollow and put out a new mini comic, along with the latest issue of Briar, for convention season which is upon us.
   What I need:  I need 1,000 dollars. All of the work I do is on a macbook pro and while I could get a different machine, time is of the essence and I'd like to install my backed up files straight to a computer as similar as my previous one and get to work.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>What's This All About?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>I've been offered a remarkable opportunity: a month-long residency at Arteles Creative Center in rural Finland. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453442770/wlujdfbuojrl65f6et0o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(photo from <a href=""http://www.arteles.org/photos.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arteles</a>)</div>
As a part of the NEO FUTURE theme residency, I'll be spending May 2016 at Arteles in Haukijärvi, Finland, generating site-specific performance material and shooting a ton of digital video footage. This residency program has been offered to a carefully selected international cohort of ""future-oriented"" artists, of which I am honored to be a part. <div>
<p>You can read more about the themed residency on <a href=""http://www.arteles.org/future_residency.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Arteles website</a>, which contains this provocative opening:  ""Utopians, dark dystopians, transhumanists and cyborgs. Space travel and other galaxies. Singularity. Retro-futurism and future societies – after artificial intelligence, after apocalypse, after art?""</p>
<p><b>During my time in Finland, I will be generating moving image material to create a series of video works titled <i>enter body into field</i> -- a title designed to evoke both the image of a human body in a natural environment, and the language of digital interfaces. This project is an exploration of possible futures for the human relationship to the body, nature, and technology, as we move toward myriad utopian or apocalyptic landscapes. </b></p>
<p>In order to make this dream a reality, I'm reaching out for your help. I'm so thrilled to get to make this work in this truly unique context, and even more so to share it with you! </p>
<p><b>This is an ambitious undertaking, and a contribution of any size will help make it happen.</b> And in addition to getting to see the project upon its completion, scroll on down to see a few other perks you can receive for donating. </p> <div> <h3>$$$???</h3>
<div>This campaign is aiming to raise $2,000 out of the total budget for this project, but to help you get the full picture, these are all the anticipated costs for this stage of ""enter body into field"".</div>
<div>Residency fee: $1,070 (this is with the current exchange rate, and after the residency fee has been reduced by 50% through financial support by Arteles.)</div>
<div>Air travel to Scandinavia: ~$600</div>
<div>Transportation costs within Finland: (for gas, the residency is providing access to a rental car): ~$80</div>
<div>Air travel back to the United States; ~$600</div>
<div>Meals while in Finland for the month: ~$250</div>
<div>Camera/Sound Recording Equipment: whether I rent or buy camera equipment will partially be determined by whether or not I receive any grant money for this item, and from what sources, as grants often prohibit the purchase (rather than rental) of A/V equipment. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Buy camera and audio recorder: ~$1,500. Rent for five weeks: ~$1,800. </span>
</div>
<div>Other costs I may incur with this project include<span style=""background-color: initial;""> travel insurance, costume and prop purchases, camera accessories, Indiegogo fees, application fees for grants and other sources of funding.</span>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Are These Perks Of Which You Speak?</h3>
In addition to my extremely enthusiastic gratitude and getting to see the work I make in response to this residency, there are some fun things you can get or experience by donating to this campaign. </div>
<div>
<ul><li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">Postcard from Finland</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - A  personal, handwritten postcard in the mail from me while I'm at my residency in Finland or traveling within Scandinavia. I'm going to look for the most delightful postcards I can find while on this adventure.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">Video Postcard</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - A unique video postcard made by me for you, posted to YouTube while I'm in Finland. This could include footage of the countryside, of what I'm working on, or of trips into town.</span><br/>

</div>
<div><ul><li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">Digital Divination Reading Video Chat</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I'm really, really excited about this one, as it allows me to include you directly in some of my current research. I'm interested in how technology becomes a part of spiritual, superstitious, and supernatural beliefs, and how being immersed in digital culture can impact occult practices. This will be a blending of traditional tarot, John Cage-inspired chance operations, and a kind of internet bibliomancy, aimed at giving both parties a topic of deep consideration for the future. (These will happen during my time in Finland, in the month before, and the month after.)</span><br/>
</li></ul></div>
<div>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>1,000 Words (&amp; A Picture)</i> - </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A new, ~1,000-word piece of writing, with an accompanying image, created by me for you. This will be in some way a reflection on the themes of my residency (possible futures of the body, nature, and technology) and/or my experiences during the residency.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>IRL Sneak Peek of Raw Footage</i> - </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A private, IRL screening of selected raw footage after I complete the residency and begin the process of creating video pieces out of the material shot on location. (Only available in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Helsinki, and Stockholm, with available dates varying for each location.)</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>Become a Part of a Video</i> - </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Become a collaborative part of one of the video pieces I create in 2016-2017 by sending me your own footage to incorporate into a new work!</span>
</li></ul>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Why Is This a Big Deal for You, Sid? </h3>
<p></p>
<p>This series of video works is the first large-scale media project I am embarking on after completing my MFA thesis, and thus marks the beginning of a new chapter in my career as an artist.

(image from Elektra Day - Last Nights, a multimedia project from 2015)
I'm a multimedia artist based in Chicago and Los Angeles, working primarily in video, sound, text, and performance. I make work blending pop culture, classical literature, and speculative autobiography, exploring ideas of mortality, the body, gender, and ability in digital culture. I'm also a poet, a contributing writer for the contemporary art blog Bad at Sports, and a lecturer at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

What's This All About?

I've been offered a remarkable opportunity: a month-long residency at Arteles Creative Center in rural Finland. 

(photo from Arteles)
As a part of the NEO FUTURE theme residency, I'll be spending May 2016 at Arteles in Haukijärvi, Finland, generating site-specific performance material and shooting a ton of digital video footage. This residency program has been offered to a carefully selected international cohort of ""future-oriented"" artists, of which I am honored to be a part. 
You can read more about the themed residency on the Arteles website, which contains this provocative opening:  ""Utopians, dark dystopians, transhumanists and cyborgs. Space travel and other galaxies. Singularity. Retro-futurism and future societies – after artificial intelligence, after apocalypse, after art?""
During my time in Finland, I will be generating moving image material to create a series of video works titled enter body into field -- a title designed to evoke both the image of a human body in a natural environment, and the language of digital interfaces. This project is an exploration of possible futures for the human relationship to the body, nature, and technology, as we move toward myriad utopian or apocalyptic landscapes. 
In order to make this dream a reality, I'm reaching out for your help. I'm so thrilled to get to make this work in this truly unique context, and even more so to share it with you! 
This is an ambitious undertaking, and a contribution of any size will help make it happen. And in addition to getting to see the project upon its completion, scroll on down to see a few other perks you can receive for donating.   $$$???
This campaign is aiming to raise $2,000 out of the total budget for this project, but to help you get the full picture, these are all the anticipated costs for this stage of ""enter body into field"".
Residency fee: $1,070 (this is with the current exchange rate, and after the residency fee has been reduced by 50% through financial support by Arteles.)
Air travel to Scandinavia: ~$600
Transportation costs within Finland: (for gas, the residency is providing access to a rental car): ~$80
Air travel back to the United States; ~$600
Meals while in Finland for the month: ~$250
Camera/Sound Recording Equipment: whether I rent or buy camera equipment will partially be determined by whether or not I receive any grant money for this item, and from what sources, as grants often prohibit the purchase (rather than rental) of A/V equipment. Buy camera and audio recorder: ~$1,500. Rent for five weeks: ~$1,800. 

Other costs I may incur with this project include travel insurance, costume and prop purchases, camera accessories, Indiegogo fees, application fees for grants and other sources of funding.


What Are These Perks Of Which You Speak?
In addition to my extremely enthusiastic gratitude and getting to see the work I make in response to this residency, there are some fun things you can get or experience by donating to this campaign. 


Postcard from Finland - A  personal, handwritten postcard in the mail from me while I'm at my residency in Finland or traveling within Scandinavia. I'm going to look for the most delightful postcards I can find while on this adventure.


Video Postcard - A unique video postcard made by me for you, posted to YouTube while I'm in Finland. This could include footage of the countryside, of what I'm working on, or of trips into town.







Digital Divination Reading Video Chat  - I'm really, really excited about this one, as it allows me to include you directly in some of my current research. I'm interested in how technology becomes a part of spiritual, superstitious, and supernatural beliefs, and how being immersed in digital culture can impact occult practices. This will be a blending of traditional tarot, John Cage-inspired chance operations, and a kind of internet bibliomancy, aimed at giving both parties a topic of deep consideration for the future. (These will happen during my time in Finland, in the month before, and the month after.)



1,000 Words (& A Picture) - A new, ~1,000-word piece of writing, with an accompanying image, created by me for you. This will be in some way a reflection on the themes of my residency (possible futures of the body, nature, and technology) and/or my experiences during the residency.


IRL Sneak Peek of Raw Footage - A private, IRL screening of selected raw footage after I complete the residency and begin the process of creating video pieces out of the material shot on location. (Only available in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Helsinki, and Stockholm, with available dates varying for each location.)


Become a Part of a Video - Become a collaborative part of one of the video pieces I create in 2016-2017 by sending me your own footage to incorporate into a new work!

   Why Is This a Big Deal for You, Sid? 

This series of video works is the first large-scale media project I am embarking on after completing my MFA thesis, and thus marks the beginning of a new chapter in my career as an artist. This is the time to put into practice all that I have learned by developing, completing, and disseminating a new body of work, and its level of success will greatly impact the next stages of my career.  
The Neo Future Residency will provide not only a breathtaking environment, completely new to me, that will shape the material I generate, but also brings a new level of ambition and international audience to my work.
    What Are Some Risks & Challenges?
If I don't meet my goal on this campaign, and I don't receive any of the grants I have applied for, then I may not be able to take advantage of this opportunity this year. I am, however, working very hard to reduce that risk to as little as possible by seeking multiple sources of funding. 


How Else Can I Help? 
   
While even the smallest amount helps, I truly, truly understand that financial contributions are not always feasible. Seriously. If you'd like to help in other ways, please reach out to me, or share this campaign with others!

<h3>{ Idea &amp; Motivation }</h3>
<p>Through Visionary Art we are expressing our experiences and feelings which are interconnected with the fully present higher consciousness. The installation is inspired by spiritual awakening and it is reflecting the flow of energy that is all around and our inner connections with the universe — the one.

<p>The creative outcome of that are 6 real-sized semi-transparent human body sculptures gathered in a circle. The seventh (empty) position in the circle is open for the festival audience to interact with the installation. The circle of the 7 represents 7 chakras. Fluroscent Visionary Paintings on the outside of the sculptures and The Cosmic Light from inside will highlight and visually express the opening of each chakra.</p><br/>
<h4>{ Sculptures &amp; Paintings }</h4>
<p>This installation contains 6 sculptures gathered in a circle and lifted from the ground around 20 cm. They will have slightly spread and open arms. The materials from which the sculptures are built are polyester resin and fiberglass which will give us a strong structure and a beautiful semi-transparent texture.</p>

<p>We will do a painting on the front of each sculpture with the spiritual story behind chakras as the original inspiration. On every sculpture a different energetic chakra center will be highlighted with a fluorescent painting. Each of the paintings will be individually designed in a unique context of the artist’s self expression.</p><br/>
<h4><span>{ Light &amp; Interaction }</span></h4>
<p><b>This work is a celebration of the light and the illumination of our existence.</b> Light has a very strong meaning for us and its visionary properties perfectly go with our idea. The challenges for us as visual artists are rethinking the light as material and sculpting with the light. From the very source of the light to the furthermost destinations, we will play with its infinite symbols.</p>
<p>Each sculpture will have addressable LED strips installed from the crown (top of the head) to root chakra (bottom of the spine). Strips will all be connected to Arduinos (<i>open-source microcontroller board</i>s) and controlled in vvvv (<i>live-programming environment for easy prototyping &amp; development</i>). These platforms are giving us freedom to play, experiment and at the end create a unique awakening experience.</p>
<p>Lights will be creatively programmed and fine tuned in order to visually express each chakra individually, as well as a circular group harmony. One of the goals is to reinforce the inner light as a great symbol of the awakening. We will dedicatedly focus and work on each light change to create a fully connected atmosphere. We will also create visual interaction between sculptures by 'passing' the light from one to another.</p>

<p>With the Kinect 2 sensor we will track motion of the people who will approach the installation. When a person from the audience joins and closes the circle with his/her arms, all the sculptures will start to have powerful harmonic LED changes which represents the awakening.</p>

With the Kinect 2 sensor we will track motion of the people who will approach the installation. When a person from the audience joins and closes the circle with his/her arms, all the sculptures will start to have powerful harmonic LED changes which represents the awakening.
We will open source the whole project and put it in the public domain for others to use in any way imaginable.
Funding details
2000€ =400€ for Sculpting Materials (~40kg of resin + fiberglass);180€ for Fluorescent Acrylic Paints;340€ for Addressable LED Strips;80€ for Microcontroller Boards;70€ for 'Connectivity' (cables etc.);490€ for transport of sculptures (from Croatia to Hungary & back);500€ for traveling costs (5 x two-way train tickets);100€ Perks.+ PayPal Fees+ Indiegogo FeesYou can choose from our appreciation perks or donate any amount by clicking on ""CONTRIBUTE NOW"" button.
If we get more funds than asked we will do a tour with the installation and share it with as many people as possible. With more money we will also be able to rent couple of projectors and implement the 3D projection mapping technique on each of the sculptures.

</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Due to annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing war in Ukraine, I had to relocate to Poland in order to continue teaching and working as an artist. Students who used to travel to me in Ukraine no longer felt safe and increasingly, it was getting harder for me to get visas to travel to my international teaching engagements. My husband and I decided to relocate to Poland, leaving our home, studio and most of our possessions behind, so that I could continue to reach my audience. He is a freelance technical translator/interpreter and can work anywhere and our daughter is studying in Germany, so Poland has been a good decision for us, especially since the language is similar enough for us to learn it quickly. </span><br/></p>
<p>I have found and rented a studio space that serves my working purposes in Gdansk. However, this relocation has left us with very little financial recourse and I would like to secure the space for one year so that I can focus on rebuilding my workshops and establish a presence here. The cost of one year rent is US $7,300. Aside from rent, I also need to furnish the studio, invest in marketing, buy supplies, and build a new website. If I can have peace of mind about the location and not have to worry about moving again, I can focus on these other things.</p>

eco-dyed garments.<br/><br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Back Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My work has evolved
into a pursuit for understanding how we can better co-exist with nature.
Eco-dyeing has become a popular interest among textile artists who are
concerned with the toxicity of commercial dyes and the impact it has on our
environment. We still have a great deal to learn about how to use plants, soil
and naturally occurring chemicals in our dye process. For the last several
years, I have documented my experiments in my blog and have had great success
in the international community in establishing my role as a mentor in this
field.</p>
<p>I had been teaching
twice a year in Lithuania, did workshops Holland, and had invitations to do the same in
Germany and Norway. But, by the end of 2014, it became harder to get visas to
travel and we realized that we needed to leave quickly if we were still going
to be able to continue this work. Poland offered us the possibility to
establish a business here so that both of us could continue to work. The
economy in Ukraine was spiraling downwards and although the war had not
reached our area when we left, we had a couple of terrorist incidents that
spread fear in our community. Not knowing how the situation would evolve, I
canceled all workshops that were local and we made our move to Poland, leaving
our home and possessions behind. We hope to be able to return someday, but have
no idea what will happen there. Living in Poland will allow me to resume my
teaching engagements and research.</p>

<h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My dream is to
establish an arts and crafts center where there can be a vibrant program for

love what I do and I thrive when I can share it with others and I believe that
the conversation between traditional and innovative textile skills has a great

 MAKING ART IS EXPENSIVE! While many artists work for free, all of us want art to be our living. Here is why you should help us:   We are cultural researchers, and our work is made to better the world. It's not hobby! Art-making is our vocation. 

Supporting this project doesn't only support us; it supports the work of all artists developing sustainable lives on their own terms.  Advocate for the value of art in our society!    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  
Spread the word! If you support our mission please share on social media!

Come to our show on September 11th, 12th and 13th. You can find more info on the Fringe Arts website.

I identify as a young transgender person--an aspiring transsexual. Something that is hugely important to me as a trans person is top surgery, aka the process whereby my breasts are removed. (I promise, it sounds a lot more painful than it actually is.) The surgery is actually a pretty basic procedure, particularly when done with an intelligent surgeon and with the emotional and physical support of friends. It is indeed my friends who have helped me reach the decision to undergo surgery.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My family does not support me at all, both with the surgery and with respect to my gender identity. As a full-time college student who is working a job and maintaining several extracurricular activities, I don't have the time or ability to raise the full expenses for the surgery myself. The necessity of the surgery for me at this point in my life, however, has driven me to fundraise--the necessity of being able to be comfortable and feel safe and okay in my body. Unfortunately I am not longer able to bind my chest due to scoliosis and related back problems, and baggy clothes can only get a person so far. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">More painful than my back when binding is the pain of getting misgendered and having my gender identity invalidated and ignored because of my appearance. Top surgery isn't a magic cure-all that will fix everything at once, but it <em>is</em> a massive step in the right direction, and something that will help my body dysphoria and self-perception.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">What I need: </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I'm hoping to raise $7500, the amount I would need to pay Dr. Garramone (Garr-ah-moan-ee!), the Florida surgeon I have chosen. The amount covers the operating room fees and the surgeon's fees, as well as part of the expenses for lodging for one week. (Dr. Garramone asks patients to stay in town for one week for recovery time and a follow-up appointment.)Even if the goal amount isn't reached, I hope to keep the funds raised to go towards my top surgery in the future, when I've managed to save up enough money on my own.</span></p>

</p><h2><b>Reclaimed: The Second Life of
Sculpture is an important exhibition highlighting significant issues facing
artists who make 3-dimensional work.</b></h2>

Reclaimed will be presented within
The Briggait's 1873 Hall during Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art from 5<sup>th</sup> April to 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2014 . The Briggait is run
by Wasps Studios, a charity who supports artists and arts organisations by
providing them with affordable studio space. <p></p>
<h4><b>Reclaimed will....<br/></b></h4>
<ul><li>Allow over 25 wonderful sculptural works languishing in storage to
     be seen by the public again. </li></ul><ul><li>Highlight problems encountered by artists and gallerists around the
     production and storage of sculptural works</li></ul><ul><li>Challenge the notion that older artworks become redundant beyond
     the life of exhibition for which they were made</li></ul><h4><b>What we need &amp; what it will do</b></h4>
<p>We aim to raise £1,500 towards the cost of mounting
this ambitious exhibition. This money will help us to bring works from 25 of
the UK and Europe's most exciting artists out of storage to be enjoyed again.
Some of these works have not been seen by the public for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Specifically, the money will help us to buy
materials for a specially constructed sculpture landscape creating a unique
experience that hundreds of visitors will not forget for a very long time! </p>
<p>Artists are productive people, and often make work
consistently year in, year out- often for decades. Studios, spare bedrooms and
garden sheds across the country are full of artworks, some of which have only
been shown once or twice, and others which have toured regularly in their

Sculpture is an important exhibition highlighting significant issues facing
artists who make 3-dimensional work.

Reclaimed will be presented within
The Briggait's 1873 Hall during Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art from 5th April to 2nd May 2014 . The Briggait is run
by Wasps Studios, a charity who supports artists and arts organisations by
providing them with affordable studio space. 
Reclaimed will....
Allow over 25 wonderful sculptural works languishing in storage to
     be seen by the public again. Highlight problems encountered by artists and gallerists around the
     production and storage of sculptural worksChallenge the notion that older artworks become redundant beyond
     the life of exhibition for which they were madeWhat we need & what it will do
We aim to raise £1,500 towards the cost of mounting
this ambitious exhibition. This money will help us to bring works from 25 of
the UK and Europe's most exciting artists out of storage to be enjoyed again.
Some of these works have not been seen by the public for over 20 years.
Specifically, the money will help us to buy
materials for a specially constructed sculpture landscape creating a unique
experience that hundreds of visitors will not forget for a very long time! 
Artists are productive people, and often make work
consistently year in, year out- often for decades. Studios, spare bedrooms and
garden sheds across the country are full of artworks, some of which have only
been shown once or twice, and others which have toured regularly in their
hey-day but are now retired.This can be a real problem for artists and gallerists
and we hope the show will stimulate discussion around these issues.

For 30 years I focused on watercolor. Once acrylics were improved I found that I enjoyed working with them as well. Recently I have renewed my love of oils. Truly I enjoy whatever medium I am using. In the past 27 years I have been teaching art to adults and children. During this time I have seen so many lives changed through my classes as my students learn to see through artist's eyes. Quality of life is always improved. Painting has certainly enriched my life in varied and vast ways.</p><p>There are two things I have longed to do to improve my painting skills. One is to spend several weeks just focusing on painting. The other, which I have sampled in smaller portions, is to travel and to experience the quality of light and the landscape in new (to me) locations. Of course, I have longed to visit France where so many of the respected artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries lived and worked. Many parts of fulfilling this longing have come together. Already, the flight, the workshop and a shared home for one week has been provided.</p><p>The remaining need is to cover housing, food, and transportation for three and a half weeks.  Your contributions would also cover museum fees. I fully expect that this experience will inspire me as an artist and as a teacher. Traveling simply and alone will enable me to focus on painting everyday.<br/></p><p>Your contributions will enable me to spend quality time painting and interacting with the light, the land, the history and the people of Provence. I will have an opportunity to focus on my development as an artist instead of focusing on class preparation and teaching each week. It will be like an artists residency on the move! Investment of this type has proven to be very valuable and is an investment in fine art and culture. This will be the first painting trip or break in my classes in 14 years. It is time I give attention to some replenishment as an artist. If I don't raise enough money I will be returning home shortly after the workshop and without the travel to the various towns that I am eager to paint.<br/></p><p>The perks I am offering are all designed to share my experiences along the way.  They are paintings of various sizes and mediums. A small painting will be a wonderful marker of what your donation created. They will all be painted while I am in France.  Many will be shipped from France. All will be frame or mat ready. Once home I will compile a book of my journey with writings, photos and paintings. This perk would make a lovely gift to an art lover. A final perk is an invitation to study with me for a few days in June when I will be in Avignon. This is a perk for someone who enjoys walking and who has some stamina. <br/></p><p>I feel such gratitude that others are taking an interest in this art journey. Your contribution will mean so much.
