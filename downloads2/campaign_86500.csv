<h3><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM6vN6nZhKw"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Love and Music</i></a></h3>
<p>My name is <strong><a href=""https://www.karaalimusic.com/bio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kara Ali</a> </strong>and I am a singer/songwriter and music industry professional based in New York City.  For the past 5 years, I have been performing on the NY scene and honing my craft at venues like Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, Pianos, Bowery Electric and Pete's Candy Store as well as playing intimate shows as part of <a href=""https://www.sofarsounds.com/nyc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sofar Sounds</a>, AcousticQueers and various songwriter's circles.  In the past, my music has been featured in documentaries, web series' and both theater and radio shows, and in late 2016, I self-released a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE_4PquZTAg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music video for my song ""In Blue"" on VEVO</a>.  Now, on the heels of my latest single release, <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/5jSYJ2tqnf1Y9ep4RM7vGz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""In My Mind""</a>, it's time for a complete EP!</p>
<p>To me, music is everything.  It is part of my day life and my night life.  It has helped me face complicated questions in our ever changing world as well as provide a brief reprieve from these questions.  Songwriting provides a level of introspection that is unparalleled. Over the years, my songwriting has most notably helped me face my own questions around self identity and I can say with certainty that music gave me the courage to come out. (I even wrote a love ballad to my girlfriend, which is <i>definitely</i> going to be included!)</p>
<p>With your contribution, you will be breathing life into the rough demos I've had laying around, just waiting to be heard.  The sincerity in songs you may have heard live in the past will be translated to recordings and I will finally be able to take my content to the next level with an authentic finished product I am proud of and you will enjoy listening to.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>The Project</i></h3>
<p>I am aiming to create a 5 song EP.  Given that this is a flexible goal campaign, I will scale the project up or back depending on the amount of funding achieved.</p>
<p>Your contribution will be going toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pre-Production: </strong>I will sit down with my producer and go through each song to determine the best arrangements for the tracks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Recording: </strong>After pre-production, we will get into the studio.  I will track guitar, vocals and pianos and loop in musicians as needed to track bass, keys, drums and others sounds.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing:</strong> Once all recording is done, mixing will ensure the right balance between each instrument and the most artistically authentic sound.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering:</strong> The final touch.  I will send the songs off to a mastering engineer to ensure they are streaming and radio ready.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Why Now?</i></h3>
<p>If not now, then when?  Over my 5 years in NY, I've gone through ups and downs and a major split with a producer who I had been working toward a full album with.  Despite some setbacks, I've spent the time re-defining and sharpening my sound as well as becoming happy and comfortable with myself as both an artist and as a person.  I feel that now, with a sharpened sense of self and a refusal to be put in a genre box, I can create the most impactful and special music.  Additionally, I can be a vehicle for change and spread love through my music, especially during a time when the world seems to need it most.</p>
</div><div><p>A big risk many artists face is a fear of vulnerability.  For me, asking for help was a great fear of mine for a while, but now I am so happy to be making myself open in this way.  In exchange for your contribution I promise to give my whole true self to this music and to this EP to make the best product possible.</p></div><div>

</div><p><b>ALBION ALBUM</b></p>
<p>Songs and music are very popular in the Harts, sitting around the campfire at night. It has been suggested to me that the faction would like some new songs to sing around the campfire, as well as a way for people to learn the established ones we all love. It was suggested to me at Midsummer after seeing the Dragon Faction singing that I should record some new and old songs so that people can expand their reportoire and that is when the idea of this album came into being. I mainly require some extra recording equipment, so I am going to give Indiegogo a try. I am trying this way so that basically the more pre-orders I get, means I can create a better album depending upon how much money is raised. It will be availiable as a CD or Digital Download, and after I have purchased the equipment I need, then half of the rest of the profits will go directly into faction funds, so please support my campaign so I can make more music at your faces!</p>

     call the stations, they can refer to all the press my publicist has been
     creating for me.  Another thing my publicist does is get me in the
     right place at the right time.  Red carpet events, product endorsement deals and opportunities for
     me to perform, make an appearance, or just get known, is all up to my
     publicist.

 
And if for
some reason we don't reach our goal, we are still going ahead as planned, just
shortening the duration of the campaign.  The $20,000 goal gets us a 12
week run, so anything less in funds, just means less time.  Nothing can
stop us!
 The Perks
Since I'm
not doing this campaign for the creation of a tangible CD to which I can credit
my contributors on the CD itself, I decided to make the perks much more
personal, and that much cooler!  I always tell my fans (my peeps!) how
much I love them, so I decided it's time we get to know each other more. 
We've got great perks that include a Skype chat with me, or even lunch with me
in Nashville!  Take a look at the column
to the right of the page; I’ve included perks that are more experience
oriented.  And I look forward to making some
new friends and fun memories together!
 
The Thank
You's 
I appreciate
each and every single one of you!  And I value your support regardless of
what you can or cannot pledge.  Please feel free to pledge whatever you
can or share this video campaign with your family and friends!  Don't
forget to use the cool IndieGogo sharing tools right here.  Let's get
together and MAKE SOME NOISE!
I love you
guys!

<h3>Explain Yourself, Rob!</h3>
<p>I've been an improv-comedy guy in Calgary for over 20 years, and I love performing with my dear friends at the Loose Moose Theatre Company.  I have also been a musician and composer for years, but something about the vulnerability of sharing songs has always seemed a bit scarier to me than making ""The Jokes""... This summer, a good friend asked me to open up for her music gig, and I suddenly felt brave enough to share my music with people (like you)!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509923461/aowbtlzbtdlvaaimv3mh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With your support, I'm hoping to get a lot done:</p>
<p>-I'll have the songs professionally mastered and made so pretty!</p>
<p>-I'll print CD's and release my songs to online stores for download!</p>
<p>-I'll get a snazzy album cover designed (probably including a bunch my own basement self portraits).</p>
<p>-I'll get set up to invite you to online concerts from the emotional safety of your very own basement! So Cozy!</p>
<p>-I'll be able to have the local college radio station ship my album all over the place!</p>
<p>-I'll be able to get a venue for an actual, real life concert!</p>
<p>And that's not to mention all the potential for low budget basement music videos down the road, upcoming new music, the chance to print to vinyl, and so much more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get:</h3>
<p>I'm looking for help with the following:</p>
<p>About a 20% of the funds are assigned to mastering the album. Then it's all done, the album will be radio ready and comply with all the digital streaming standards and amusement park ride regulations. The songs must be, for example, loud and well balanced enough so that the guy at the summer fair can say ""Do you wanna go faster?"" and we can't be heard responding.</p>
<p>The next 50% of our goal is printing a limited run of CDs, and getting digital distribution in your favourite online music stores. This is the main element, as this will get the songs out there to humanity, and not just my mom.</p>
<p>Finally, the last 30% of the funding will be used for preparing for online concerts, securing a venue for real life concerts, paying for graphic design (because that's one thing I'm not doing by myself), and getting you your perks delivered!</p>
<p>If, by sheer force of will, we go over the goal, we can start talking about vinyl, more shows, and a digital release of my ""Rejected Songs"" album, which is full of glorious gems...</p>
<h2><strong>So, the PERKS:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>- Get The Album: </strong></p>
<p>For most of our contributors, you'll be getting my album in the format of your choice! Want the real thing signed? I'll do that! Want the digital thing signed? I'll figure out a way to do that.</p>
<p><strong>-Get ""Rejected Songs"": </strong></p>
<p>Get the album, AND For folks with a keen ear for weirdness, you can get a special download of my ""Rejected Songs"" album, which, as previously mentioned, is full of genius, strangeness, and randomness. Highlights include ""Christmas Metal"", the 6 second long""Luchadorks"", and ""There is Something in My Eye"", which is exactly like what it sounds like. Plus much, much more!</p>
<p><strong>-Get it on Minidisc?</strong></p>
<p>Get the album in a normal format, and then,yeah, minidisc. I'll burn it for you myself, send over a miniaturized version of the album art and everything. </p>
<p><strong>-Exclusive Online Concert Live from My Basement!</strong></p>
<p>Get the album, AND a show!  There's no parking fees, no dress code, nobody will shame you for eating an entire bag of candy in one of those ""sharing"" size bags by yourself! I'm busily rehearsing, and soon I'll start taking requests.</p>
<p><strong>-A Real Live Show in the Real World!</strong></p>
<p>We will all convene at a real venue in the real world, we will come prepared with whatever social anxiety coping mechanisms we require, and then I will rock you folkfully! You'll tell your kids about it, for sure. I can guarantee a very funny show that also features very sincere music!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>But Rob, what happens if you don't meet your goal?</strong></p>
<p>Well, The mastering is underway, and I will painstakingly and very gradually prepare my album for release some time in the future. But do you really want to miss the musical equivalent of this image? Yeah, nobody does. So photoshoppy!</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Genuinely, your support is going to make a real dream come true for me. I have always imagined myself sharing my songs with everyone! I'm so proud of this album, there's a fun variety, you'll dance, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and also there's that one song about soup.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This one is easy. The album is finished, and all it needs is a final push. I'll take a second job if I have to. There's a pretty sweet gaming store about a block away. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>I'm on Facebook at ""Rob Mitchelson's Music n' Such""</p>

We use culturally relevant arts as a motivational platform to inspire youth toward academic achievement, increased self-confidence and the building of essential life skills.



With your support, we’ll be able to create ME Phoenix and pay for 12 months worth of operation costs.  After that, the programs become completely self sustaining.  Thanks to this unique business model, you can be confident that your donation will continue helping under-served youth and foster youth for many years to come.



In 2005, our Founder and CEO Ian Welsch came to Miami to begin his career
in education.  As a public school
teacher, he watched from the front row as budget cuts gutted school arts
programs.  
In addition to education, Ian is also an entrepreneur who
started an in-home tutoring company shortly after he arrived in Florida.  Unfortunately, he came to realize that many
of the children who needed his help the most couldn’t afford private tutoring.

Ever the visionary, Ian looked at two big problems and saw
one huge opportunity.  In 2008, he
founded The Motivational Edge.
The Motivational Edge is a non-profit outreach and after school
program serving the inner city youth of Miami, Florida and South Florida. We use culturally relevant arts as a
motivational platform to inspire youth toward academic achievement, increased
self-confidence and the building of essential life skills.







The Motivational Edge provides academic tutoring as
well as instruction in music and art.  At
The Motivational Edge, students can take classes in:
-  The Art of Creative Writing and Lyrial Expression
- 
Music Production
-  Dance Expression
- 
DJing
- 
Many Musical Instruments 
- 
Urban Arts Expression




Our free tutoring services are available to any qualifying child
in our community who needs support in order to succeed academically.  Through no fault of their own though, many of
these children are facing realities in which scholastic achievement is not the
priority. We provide culturally relevant arts instruction to these
children free of charge.  In exchange, we
require that our young musicians and artists maintain their grades.  Any student running below a ""C"" average in any of
their core courses is required to receive tutoring in order to participate in the music and arts program(s).










The benefits to our kids are undeniable.  Many children who are unable to express and
process their emotions verbally can do so through music and art.  When youth participate in our arts program we
regularly see:



Academic improvement


Increased parental involvement


Motivation to succeed in and out of school


Increased confidence and morale


Increased self-awareness and discipline


Inspiration of the creative spirit through music
and rhythm



In addition, we bring jobs to the community and can be a
referral source to other youth organizations.



We have been so inspired and encouraged by the change we've seen in our Miami
community and its youth, we want to offer The Motivational Edge's programs to youth across America.  Obviously that won’t happen overnight, so
we’re starting small.  One new location at a time,
one new city: Phoenix, Arizona. We anticipate to serve over 400 students in the first 12 months of operation, but need your help!











Besides a little community support and a lot of kids ready
to learn and have fun, we need $200,000. 
With that money, we’ll be able to create ME Phoenix and pay for 12 months
worth of operation costs.  After that,
the programs become completely self sustaining. 
Thanks to this unique business model, you can be confident that your
donation will continue helping under-served youth and foster youth for many years to come.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am looking at an international career in opera and would very much appreciate your help in aiding me to pay for a doctoral program in the UK.</p>
<ul>
<li>I hold a BA in music, voice emphasis, from Whitworth University in Spokane, WA.

<li>I am raising funds to help me study in the United Kingdom at either the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland or the University of Cardiff. I have been given a great gift and am looking at an international opera career. This career would be greatly aided by a degree from a reputable European university, such as both previously mentioned schools. </li>
<li>By studying in the United Kingdom, I would kickstart my career on stages such as the Welsh National Opera in Cardiff, Wales, I would be able to sing in houses including the Sydney Opera House, Covent Garden, La Scala, perhaps even the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

<p>Beyond a simple desire to go to Europe, I am feeling called to follow my giftings out of the United States and use them in a much larger arena for the Lord's glory and praise.

<p>America's Disaster Relief is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, whose purpose is to help people get back on their feet after major natural disasters occurring in the continental United States.  When fire, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes strike, America's Disaster Relief is a <i>second </i>responder.  After the first responders leave survivors still need help.  America's Disaster Relief arrives to 
help those survivors put their lives back together.  When possible, disaster victims are fed for free in their neighborhoods.  Personal and household
 items are also delivered by 18 wheelers to prearranged distribution locations.</p>
<p>All personnel, including board members donate their time, so <span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"">contributions go directly to helping people in need.</span>  Like most relief organizations however, America's Disaster Relief is limited in how much they can help by the amount of charitable gifts they receive.  There are no professional fundraisers on the payroll, so getting enough donations of cash and supplies is always a challenge.<br/></p>
<p><b><font color=""#151b8d"">The purpose of this Campaign</font></b> is to kick off a privately funded First Aid Kit product, which will be offered for sale on Amazon.com.  <span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"">America's Disaster Relief will receive half of the profits from this venture</span> in exchange for endorsing the First Aid Kit and licensing the use of America's Disaster Relief branding on the Kit.  The expected revenue from this project is not intended to replace normal charitable giving, but could be an important source of supplemental income that America's Disaster Relief will put to good use for many years.  </p>
<p>The America's Disaster Relief First Aid Kit has been designed with quality as a top priority.  Most of the items in the Repair Kit will be manufactured in the United States, and the Kits will also be assembled in the U.S.  That does mean that the Kit is a little more expensive to make than some of our competition, however we feel that being able to ensure consistent quality justifies the added cost.  We also believe potential customers will be more supportive of U.S. made products and have more confidence in them.  In addition, we expect to win many customers who need a First Aid Kit, but also want to support America's Disaster Relief.  Finally, the profit margin we have priced into the First Aid Kits is very modest, so we're able to offer a great kit at an affordable price.  We believe this combination of quality, affordability and support for America's Disaster Relief will result in many sales for many years.</p>

The Computer Crashes...

Willow Park set out on a journey to release it's 1st 5 song EP the end of Feb 2013 and.....it didn't happen ;(    In the middle of recording, we got the infamous blue screen of death and then zap....no power.  It's a horrible feeling when we were on a roll and had great momentum.  We let it stop us in our tracks for a few months but then decided the music was too special not to move forward.
We used all the money we saved for the project to fix the computer that crashed mid project, software that was too outdated to work on the upgraded system and the hardware that well, you guessed it....stopped working.

<div>
<p>'The Fall of the House of Usher', a new chamber opera by Felix Jarrar, is based on Edgar Allan Poe's story of the same name. The story is about a nameless friend (to be played by tenor, Jonas Budris) that visits Roderick Usher (to be played by bass-baritone, Jeremy Hirsch), an old companion from his boyhood, in an unspecified gothic land. When the friend arrives at the House of Usher, the place where Roderick lives, he learns of the illness that has plagued and killed almost all the members of Roderick's extended family. The only surviving members of the Usher family are Roderick and his elusive and decrepit twin sister, Lady Madeline (to be played by soprano, Corrine Byrne). As the friend gradually begins to experience the effects of the Usher illness in the House, his loyalty to Roderick turns into an obsession. The nature of the relationships between all three characters becomes blurred and hazy as they come face to face with their respective destinies. </p>
<p>The opera is unique in that it tells the famed gothic story from the perspective of Lady Madeline. In Jarrar's libretto and score, the audience gets to hear Madeline's side of the story in all of its horrific ghoulishness. Jarrar draws on various literary theories about the Poe story to create an original, terse and dramatically compelling adaptation of the tale. He is writing the libretto and score for the work as his capstone project for his undergraduate thesis in music composition and piano performance at Marlboro College.</p>
<p>'The Fall of the House of Usher' will receive it's world premiere at Marlboro College's Whittemore Theater in Marlboro, Vermont on Monday March 28th and Tuesday March 29th, 2016 at 8:00 pm. The New York premiere performances of the work will take place at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music in New York City on Friday April 15th, 2016 and Saturday April 16th, 2016 at 8:00 pm. The production will be directed and designed by Kristi Leigh. The piano quartet will consist of Brendan Speltz on violin, Molly Carr on viola, Andrew Janss on cello and Felix Jarrar on the piano.</p>

<p>Ok here

<p>•<span> 
</span>We are an Edinburgh based Orchestral Folk Rock Band, named after a

<p>•<span>

our 1st one are sadly no more, so we're going to put out the new one ourselves.</p>
<p>•<span>

album incurs. With your help we can get it out there, and you can get awesome
exclusive stuff in return!</p>
<p><b>We
Need You!</b></p>
<p>The new
album is recorded. We did it at our good friend Keith's home studio on the
outskirts of Edinburgh. We started in January 2012. It's taken this long to
make due to many things, but mainly through losing a couple of members because
of personal reasons, which meant having to put recording on hold whilst we
auditioned new folks Caroline and Craig to the fold and taught them the songs.</p>
<p>We are
now seeking funding to do the following:</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Professionally Master the album</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Pay for Promo CD Copies to be pressed and sent out to Press &amp; Media</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Pay for CD's of the album in Shrink Wrapped Jewel Cases with 8 Page
Booklets for you good people out there</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Pay For a 3 month PR Campaign to successfully promote the album release</p>
<p>We are trying to raise £2500. If we do not
raise the full amount we could put some of what we raise towards some of the
above, but to allow us to get the album out there, fully promoted, and to do
the album justice, it's important we reach the full amount, so please help all
you can.</p>
<p><b>How
Your Contribution Will Help &amp; What You Get In Return</b></p>
<p>See this
as a place to pre-order our 2nd Album, but with the added bonus of getting it
in your hands before anyone else, anywhere. When you pledge some money today, you will instantly get a digital download of an unheard track demoed for the record.</p>
<p>You can
also bag other exclusive stuff like your name in the liner
note 'Thank You's', invites to secret album playback parties, free entry to the
album launch gigs in the new year, an Acoustic Show in your living
room for you and all your friends, and even the hand illustrated Acoustic Guitar that Scott used on the first album and tour!</p>
<p>We want
to show our appreciation to you for supporting us in any way we can.</p>

<h3>Our Goal:</h3>
<p>We are on a mission to raise an additional $5,000 to establish a start-up fund for the 2012-2016 One Million Strong Traveling Photo Essay Exhibit, which kicked off at the Hayti Heritage Center in Durham, North Carolina on October 2, 2012 and closes on February 25, 2013. </p>
<p><strong>*If you donated to the previous campaign for the exhibit launch and would like to donate again, please know that the featured images for all the perks in this campaign are different than the last, so even if you donate at the same level, you'll get 2 distinct gifts in return.*</strong></p>
<p>Any money raised in excess of our funding goal will be used to pay our grant writer and event consultant for additional weeks - or if you're feeling really generous - additional months of work.</p>
<h3>About One Million Strong:</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/onemillionstrong"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""One Million Strong Facebook Page"">One Million Strong Traveling Photo Exhibit</a> captures the essence of the Million Man March (Washington, D.C.) and the 10 years of subsequent political/cultural gatherings it inspired: The World Day of Atonement in New York City (1996); The Million Women March in Philadelphia (1997); The Million Youth March in Harlem (1998); The Million Youth Movement in Atlanta (1998); The Million Family March in Washington, DC. (2000); and the Millions More Movement March in Washington, DC (2005).</p>
<p>The One Million Strong Exhibit consists of one hundred 16"" x 20"" photos, as well as essay text and video, and caters to community and educational groups. This the first full-showing of the collected work and it will become a traveling exhibit, available to colleges, community centers, and museums.</p>
<p>Installations of this work have previously been shown at the North Carolina Museum of History (Raleigh, NC), the International Center &amp; Civil Rights Museum (Greensboro, NC), Delta Fine Arts Center (Winston-Salem, NC), and Lucy Florence Coffee House (Los Angeles, CA).</p>
<p>You may view images here: <span><strong><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/onemillionstrong"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/onemillionstrong</a>.</strong></span></p>
<h3>Targeted Cities for the Tour Include:</h3>
<p>Atlanta; New York; Los Angeles;, Dallas; New Orleans; Washington, DC; Philadelphia; Orlando; Detroit; Chicago; St. Louis; Oakland; Greensboro; Winston-Salem; Houston; Austin; Minneapolis; Cincinnati; Cleveland; Jackson, Mississippi; Tallahassee; Little Rock; Hartford; Boston; Baltimore; Richmond; Seattle; Wilmington, North Carolina; Oklahoma City; Phoenix; and Nashville.</p>
<h3>Your Donation Pays for...</h3>
<p>• Computer equipment - an Apple laptop, an iMac and a hard drive to be used for editing/printing photos, editing/distributing video from the discussion series, storing important files, laying out the forthcoming book... All equipment will be put to good use.</p>
<p><em>If you'd like to make a material donation in the form of the aforementioned items, please email <a href=""mailto:katina@katinaparker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">katina@katinaparker.com</a> for specs.</em></p>
<p>• Paying a grant writer to help us get dough so that the project is sustainable.</p>
<p>• Creating a digital press kit, including a video about the exhibit, to send out to potential exhibit venues.</p>
<h3>One Million Strong is being used to:</h3>
<p>• Celebrate and affirm images of Black people who have engaged in political protest for the betterment of their families and communities.</p>
<div>
<p>• Foster critical dialogue about the diversity of political perspectives that exist in Black communities and develop methods to work across our differences.</p>
<p>• Inspire participants (youth in particular) to document their communities.</p>
<p>• Engage, activate, and organize participants around pressing issues that continue to threaten the health of our families like the prison industrial complex, youth violence, housing, education, and unemployment. </p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Our Goal:
We are on a mission to raise an additional $5,000 to establish a start-up fund for the 2012-2016 One Million Strong Traveling Photo Essay Exhibit, which kicked off at the Hayti Heritage Center in Durham, North Carolina on October 2, 2012 and closes on February 25, 2013. 
*If you donated to the previous campaign for the exhibit launch and would like to donate again, please know that the featured images for all the perks in this campaign are different than the last, so even if you donate at the same level, you'll get 2 distinct gifts in return.*
Any money raised in excess of our funding goal will be used to pay our grant writer and event consultant for additional weeks - or if you're feeling really generous - additional months of work.
About One Million Strong:
The One Million Strong Traveling Photo Exhibit captures the essence of the Million Man March (Washington, D.C.) and the 10 years of subsequent political/cultural gatherings it inspired: The World Day of Atonement in New York City (1996); The Million Women March in Philadelphia (1997); The Million Youth March in Harlem (1998); The Million Youth Movement in Atlanta (1998); The Million Family March in Washington, DC. (2000); and the Millions More Movement March in Washington, DC (2005).
The One Million Strong Exhibit consists of one hundred 16"" x 20"" photos, as well as essay text and video, and caters to community and educational groups. This the first full-showing of the collected work and it will become a traveling exhibit, available to colleges, community centers, and museums.
Installations of this work have previously been shown at the North Carolina Museum of History (Raleigh, NC), the International Center & Civil Rights Museum (Greensboro, NC), Delta Fine Arts Center (Winston-Salem, NC), and Lucy Florence Coffee House (Los Angeles, CA).
You may view images here: http://www.facebook.com/onemillionstrong.
Targeted Cities for the Tour Include:
Atlanta; New York; Los Angeles;, Dallas; New Orleans; Washington, DC; Philadelphia; Orlando; Detroit; Chicago; St. Louis; Oakland; Greensboro; Winston-Salem; Houston; Austin; Minneapolis; Cincinnati; Cleveland; Jackson, Mississippi; Tallahassee; Little Rock; Hartford; Boston; Baltimore; Richmond; Seattle; Wilmington, North Carolina; Oklahoma City; Phoenix; and Nashville.
Your Donation Pays for...
• Computer equipment - an Apple laptop, an iMac and a hard drive to be used for editing/printing photos, editing/distributing video from the discussion series, storing important files, laying out the forthcoming book... All equipment will be put to good use.
If you'd like to make a material donation in the form of the aforementioned items, please email katina@katinaparker.com for specs.
• Paying a grant writer to help us get dough so that the project is sustainable.
• Creating a digital press kit, including a video about the exhibit, to send out to potential exhibit venues.
One Million Strong is being used to:
• Celebrate and affirm images of Black people who have engaged in political protest for the betterment of their families and communities.

• Foster critical dialogue about the diversity of political perspectives that exist in Black communities and develop methods to work across our differences.
• Inspire participants (youth in particular) to document their communities.
• Engage, activate, and organize participants around pressing issues that continue to threaten the health of our families like the prison industrial complex, youth violence, housing, education, and unemployment.

<h2>The Scoop</h2>
<h3>My name's Kyle Roberts and my partner J.D. Junkins and I are opening up a new venue in Birmingham, AL on July 7th, 2012. Zion is going to be a place where kids can come hang out and feel safe while enjoying their favorite bands. We are going to be booking shows of all different genres and pride ourselves on a positive atmosphere. By positive atmosphere we mean that there won't be any drinking, smoking, cursing, or fighting. We will also be booking only bands that we see as positive..you won't have to worry about getting called out from the stage for your religious or political beliefs.</h3>

<div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<h3>We are asking for a measly $3,500 hundred bucks, but this money means the world to us and your experience at Zion. </h3>
<h3>The money will help us to get over the hump of start-up costs, purchase a PA/Sound System and provide you with the best music experience possible. We need to buy banners, lights and concessions that will enhance Zion greatly.</h3>
<h3>We owe a great deal to The River Church for allowing us to put on shows in their building and the least we can do is help them with what will be a hefty power bill!</h3>
<h3>Lastly, we want to be able to pay the bands that spent their time rehearsing and drove(probably in a large van) out to our venue to play. </h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Brett Weller and The Congregation (BWTC) is an inspirational band hailing from New Orleans. Joining with frontman Brett Weller and his unique rhythm-guitar groove, is a collective of artists adding a variety of styles. It has been said that BWTC brings “a gumbo of sound” to the table. Similar to the likes of Switchfoot, Mumford &amp; Sons, and John Mark McMillan, the band does not shy from it’s roots of faith, but channels it into anthems of life, love, and honest humanity. Add this message to the band’s New Orleans’ funk groove, and you will find BWTC brings a sound that is truly music for the soul.</p>
<p>Brett Weller and The Congregation needs your support to record and release a new album! Over the past couple of years, fans of our New Orleans based funk-rock band, have been asking the question, “When will we get to hear these songs on a record?”. The truth of the matter (and one that we all know) is that recording and releasing a record cost a good bit of money. Of course, some bands sign a record deal which covers the studio, release, and promotional cost of a record; however, the band itself still has to find a way to pay that money back. This is not the situation BWTC finds ourselves in for this recording project. What we want to do is find our fans across the country, make new ones along the way, and ask YOU to help us fund this project! In return, we have a number of really special gifts we wish to bestow upon you to show our appreciation of your support!</p>
<p><i><strong>The next couple of paragraphs are just more info on the band. If you would like to stop here, and start supporting this project then scroll down to ""What We Need &amp; What You Get""! </strong></i></p>
<p>In 2015, Brett Weller began to collaborate heavily with other members of BWTC in order to discover the core sound of Brett Weller and The Congregation. Later that year the band released their single “Without a Trace” which was unlike anything the group had recorded before. This single set the tone of what the band was looking to bring to the table. Since then, the next step has been to release a full album representing this new wave of BWTC songs. Throughout the past couple of years, the band has continued to write and introduce new songs to fans at shows in order to best determine which songs will make it to the recording floor. </p>
<p>We are very excited to announce that the songs we have been working on for this album are finally ready to record. We want to do the absolute best we can with your support! As an independent band, there is a limitation to what we can do ourselves. The level of support you provide will determine what we are able to accomplish.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In simple words, we are asking YOU to be our record label. We are currently asking for at least $4,000 to get us started. This will help cover tracking, basic mixing, and distribution. If we exceed this goal then it will only help us to put more funds into the album, pay more talented people to get involved, and make this project the best album we can for you!</p>
<p>For your support we have a entire tour of perks to explore. Visit the perks section of our campaign to take a tour through our home town, New Orleans. Each street you visit will give you something to pick up along way. Start your tour on Canal Street and if you are feeling really generous then head on all the way through the city to the big prize on St. Charles Avenue. Each street's perk adds on to the previous perk's package.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to contribute financially, we understand! There are many ways you can still help us get the word out. Please consider sharing the link to our campaign and/or our promotional campaign video to your Facebook, website, and blogs.  There is a great ""share"" link at the top of our Indiegogo campaign that will send your followers directly to this campaign page.  </p>

For your support we have a entire tour of perks to explore. Visit the perks section of our campaign to take a tour through our home town, New Orleans. Each street you visit will give you something to pick up along way. Start your tour on Canal Street and if you are feeling really generous then head on all the way through the city to the big prize on St. Charles Avenue. Each street's perk adds on to the previous perk's package.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are not able to contribute financially, we understand! There are many ways you can still help us get the word out. Please consider sharing the link to our campaign and/or our promotional campaign video to your Facebook, website, and blogs.  There is a great ""share"" link at the top of our Indiegogo campaign that will send your followers directly to this campaign page.

<h3>`My Story</h3>
<p>Since the 6th grade, I have been writing and recording music with many talented musicians. Between the Urban Funk Monkeys, <a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/strikeoftheheart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Strike of the Heart"">Strike of the Heart</a>, other smaller projects including a jazz quartette, and producing an EP by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh0oSdFlxJo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jared Vincent"">Jared Vincent</a>, I have put a lot of music on tape. However, throughout all of this time, I have never had the opportunity to record my own music, unless it was done in my basement or apartment using Garageband on my MacBook. Now I am setting out to record my very own, 10 track, nicely polished, solo album.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Aside from playing music, I also perform in musical theater. Over the last few years, I find myself having to submit music, or recordings of me playing different instruments. Productions of <i>Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story, </i>or <i>American Idiot,</i> and the like, require that you play instruments. However, I have never had my own recordings to submit. I would like to finally have material of my own to represent myself professionally, while also trying to branch outside of theater and into the music world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>I will be using <a href=""http://www.studiocrash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"" title=""Studio Crash"">Studio Crash</a> in Philadelphia, PA, where I have worked previously on a demo for <a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/strikeoftheheart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"" title=""Strike of the Heart"">Strike of the Heart</a>. After talking with the owner, Michael Harmon, about the breakdown of each song, how long everything will take to record, master, and then press, we came up with the $7,000 budget that I am asking your help with. After recording, mixing and mastering are complete, the album will be printed on CD and also available online for download!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal of $7,000, I still want to record. I will use what I have to produce a shorter EP. I would still  make it available online and use it to represent my own material in the professional world. </p>

<br/><h3>How we make it future-proof</h3>
<p>Originally Geek Source just like other music servers on the market, we developed a nice PCB from standard PC that with the Intel standard CPU, situate hard drives or solid state drive there. It works ok; but we know that is not ideal. So there are three things we decided to push the envelope a bit more. </p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Instead of using more power consuming standard PC CPU, we decide to use a more future-proof <b>Quad core ARM</b> core CPU. It reduced the power related high frequency noise, the system doesn't need a noisy fan inside anymore.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By using System On Module (<b>SOM</b>) design, Geek Source could even upgrade the CPU in future when you needed. All related power supply and cache got upgraded too. All you need to do is pop-out the SOM card and insert the new one. Job done! </span><br/>

<p>As its name suggests, Geek Source is THE BEST music source in your home stereo. Geek Source is the most powerful and high-end music server available for under $1500. It was also specifically designed with the modern high definition DAC in mind. </p>
<ul>
<li>Geek Source features a whopping 2TB (4TB optional) of internal hard drive storage space. That's enough space to store 5000+ Hi-Rez tracks or 50,000+ CD quality tracks!</li>
<li>Built in Double Phase Re-Clock Jitter Elimination circuit for all output digital circuits. Every digital output is precisely timed making it the perfect fit for any system that has a dedicated DAC.</li>
<li>Many of us have trouble playing FLAC or DSD files with iTunes. Fret no more. Geek Source is a high resolution music playing specialist. Looking to play FLAC, DSD, DSD2, DXD and 384K? Geek Source handles it all.</li>
<li>Dedicated <b>USB 3.0</b> audio port output with a noise free power supply. This isn't your Grandpa's PC or MAC music server. Geek Source is a super high speed playback machine.</li>
<li>Less noise, more music. Geek Source has an external power supply, keeping the bad noise at bay while letting the good noise (your tasty tunes) in.</li>

<h3><b>Industry leading USB 3.0 output HD music server </b></h3>
<p>Connect a nice USB cable from Geek Source to Pulse DAC and you're ready to rock. Did we mention that the USB output for Geek Source is in <b>SuperSpeed USB 3.0</b> port? By this future-proof design, you would be able to play even higher resolution or multichannel high resolution music file in future. If you have our LightSpeed USB <b>10G</b> cable too, you could make sure your music system definitely has enough bandwidth for your highest sampling rate music file.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449199485/pkgpsi9s9itsyzyyvjw4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>Optional Triple Femto Clocks</b></h3><div>In the beginning of the design, we put optional<b> Dual Femto</b> clocks for all the SPIDE/AES audio outputs.

SATA II interface will direct connect to your 2T or 4T or higher capacity hard drive there. The power supply of these hard drive has special design to block out the mechanical generated power surge noise. </p><p>Geek Source has full size SDXC card slot, high speed WiFi interface and 1000M Ethernet to provide all the extension and connectivity you need. </p><p>You could choose Solid State Drive (SSD) as an option. So there will be NO mechanical spinning parts inside your Geek Source. Absolute quiet! The life span of SSD should be more stable too. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>The technical specifications of Geek Source  (Audio related part)</b></h2><p>Second part of specifications will give you more details about ""Audio related"" design. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449734196/kddhxb40kfa5w6fjnrkm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

</div><div><br/></div>First of all, SPDIF and AES/EBU output will be well controlled by ultra low jitter TCXO audio clocks. Again, this is not ordinary PC music server. If you ask something even better, Geek Source Femto will provide dual audio master clocks that controls all the digital audio outputs? These Femto clocks' jitter is 100 times less the the ordinary clocks you will find on the market.<p>The AOS (Audio optimized Operation System) is another essential part of the whole platform. We wrote the software dedicated to all audio transmission path. From CPU, to internal bus transmission, to USB 3.0 IC all the way out. The whole system boot up super fast and still kept very stable for running in weeks. </p><p>DSD native output via either DSD over PCM (DoP) or native DSD protocol are all provided.

We love to provide you upgrade possibilities. Future proof. And this time, thanks for your patience for our design time. (We know it is been one year and more), we decide to make this upgrade <b>FREE for every Geek Source backers!!</b><br/><div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>* Ultra-low ESR Power Cap Upgrade</b><div>
<p></p>
<p>Larry believes the best power supply is the foundation of everything. We will install 5 special low ESR Power capacitors in strategic important places for the mother board. Where is the most important places?  Core S.O.M, digital audio output and USB 3.0 port! thanks for your patience for our design time. We decide to make this upgrade <b>FREE for every Geek Source backers!!</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>* Power Cap upgrade Plus: </b>For the people who back the power cap upgrade before, We will enhance the following: Besides the 5 low ESR caps that everyone has, there will be 10 more ultra high speed PPS bypass power caps to replace the original MLCC capacitors. Bring down the 10M Hz above noise 6 dB more around the digital audio output and USB 3.0 audio output. </p>
<p>Let's call it ""Power Cap upgrade Plus""!</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">* Geek Source Plus upgrade. </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> The original design in the campaign was the Intel PC architecture. Now we change to ARM core based with SOM modular design. The benefit of that is future proof. Also bring one good benefit: We don't need to boot up the operation system from hard drive. All Geek Source boot up from the EMMC flash. So in the spirit of ""Plus"" upgrade, we add the 64G ultra high speed flash as separate cache  and add more layer of cache dedicated to USB audio output usage which will further reduce the output jitter. </span><br/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">* Dual Femto Clocks Upgrade</b><br/></p>
<p>Upgrade the two audio clocks inside Geek Source to customized, lowest-jitter, USA-made Crystek TCXO clocks. This special upgrade will belong to the Indiegogo backers who pledge this upgrade during the campaign. Expect the price will be at least double for this configuration in MSRP. <br/></p>
<p>As for the third Femto clock that works with USB 3.0 output. We will update more information for the final details.</p>
<p></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Roon and Tidal support in software</h2>In our current internal beta software, we already structured a good framework for support these two great services in near future. With Roon service enabled, you could use Geek Source with local/remote music library, and works perfectly with Tidal lossless music service too. </div>

<div>There are five more items need to be finished as we saw in the chart. Internal storage (hard drive) mechanical design is the target this month. And we are working with our WiFi module provider to make sure what is the problem. Software part is very time consuming but our plan is to ship something has core function smooth and add the new features via software upgrades. </div>
<div>The most important thing here is definitely USB 3.0 interface. We already optimized the 5V power supply there, tested noise level is 5.7uV (20~20K), but we really hope to maximize the signal through put by the putting an even better USB 3.0 IC which has been used in many advanced industrial grade computer server.</div>
<div>We will keep this section updated bi-weekly until we finish all the remaining pieces.</div>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1. Will Geek Source support I2S over HDMI?</div>
<div>Answer: Yes. </div>
<div>2. How Geek Source connect with Pulse DAC or Vi DAC?</div>
<div>Answer: You could choose from USB (preferred) or AES/EBU or Coaxial (least preferred)</div>
<div>3. Why design team decide to change from Intel CPU to ARM core CPU?</div>
<div>Answer: We tested between different platforms. ARM Core CPU's OS foot print is smaller and energy consumption is lower. So we could provide cleaner and better decoupling caps there which will lower the potential output high frequency noise. </div>
<div>4. Why you let OS all run from flash instead of hard disk?</div>
<div>Answer: The boot up time is faster. It works quiet.  And you could make your mechanical hard drive a TOTAL music file storage. Easier for you to swap.</div>
<div>5. How will you guys design the power supply? Is it linear?</div>
<div>Answer: We will update another concise chart for power distribution. All of the core audio circuit and USB 3.0 related circuit are powered by ultra low noise linear power supply. Not a single point compromised. </div>

Three major design goals:   Build a stable and yet future proof high res music playback platform Design to be ""audio"" optimized from the software to hardware Provide great connectivity via WiFi, ethernet and easy to expand storage space  




How we make it future-proof
Originally Geek Source just like other music servers on the market, we developed a nice PCB from standard PC that with the Intel standard CPU, situate hard drives or solid state drive there. It works ok; but we know that is not ideal. So there are three things we decided to push the envelope a bit more. 


Instead of using more power consuming standard PC CPU, we decide to use a more future-proof Quad core ARM core CPU. It reduced the power related high frequency noise, the system doesn't need a noisy fan inside anymore.

By using System On Module (SOM) design, Geek Source could even upgrade the CPU in future when you needed. All related power supply and cache got upgraded too. All you need to do is pop-out the SOM card and insert the new one. Job done! 


USB 2.0 audio output like everybody else?  No. Let's make it real 3.0. From the CPU decoding to internal transmission bus, all the way to the end of USB 3.0 SuperSpeed output IC. No compromise here. Not limited to 480M bps transmission speed anymore, now you have 5G bps. 10X more. 

   

Geek Source Overview
As its name suggests, Geek Source is THE BEST music source in your home stereo. Geek Source is the most powerful and high-end music server available for under $1500. It was also specifically designed with the modern high definition DAC in mind. 

Geek Source features a whopping 2TB (4TB optional) of internal hard drive storage space. That's enough space to store 5000+ Hi-Rez tracks or 50,000+ CD quality tracks!
Built in Double Phase Re-Clock Jitter Elimination circuit for all output digital circuits. Every digital output is precisely timed making it the perfect fit for any system that has a dedicated DAC.
Many of us have trouble playing FLAC or DSD files with iTunes. Fret no more. Geek Source is a high resolution music playing specialist. Looking to play FLAC, DSD, DSD2, DXD and 384K? Geek Source handles it all.
Dedicated USB 3.0 audio port output with a noise free power supply. This isn't your Grandpa's PC or MAC music server. Geek Source is a super high speed playback machine.
Less noise, more music. Geek Source has an external power supply, keeping the bad noise at bay while letting the good noise (your tasty tunes) in.




Industry leading USB 3.0 output HD music server 
Connect a nice USB cable from Geek Source to Pulse DAC and you're ready to rock. Did we mention that the USB output for Geek Source is in SuperSpeed USB 3.0 port? By this future-proof design, you would be able to play even higher resolution or multichannel high resolution music file in future. If you have our LightSpeed USB 10G cable too, you could make sure your music system definitely has enough bandwidth for your highest sampling rate music file.Optional Triple Femto ClocksIn the beginning of the design, we put optional Dual Femto clocks for all the SPIDE/AES audio outputs. One is for 44.1K band sampling rate (44.1K/88.2K/176.4K) and the other is for 48K band sampling rate (48K/96K/192K). With several deep researches, we decided to put optional 3rd Femto level clocks that dedicated to USB 3.0 interface alone. Benefit? We will reduce the USB audio output signal jitter even lower which translated into a much more stable sound stage and natural music when you use your USB DAC.The technical specifications of Geek Source  (Platform part)We know you care about every details of this design. So let's start with the essential platform part. (Please download the PDF here)This platform use Quad Core ARM core CPU with ultra-fast NAND storage and eMMC flash as secondary cache. SATA II interface will direct connect to your 2T or 4T or higher capacity hard drive there. The power supply of these hard drive has special design to block out the mechanical generated power surge noise. Geek Source has full size SDXC card slot, high speed WiFi interface and 1000M Ethernet to provide all the extension and connectivity you need. You could choose Solid State Drive (SSD) as an option. So there will be NO mechanical spinning parts inside your Geek Source. Absolute quiet! The life span of SSD should be more stable too. The technical specifications of Geek Source  (Audio related part)Second part of specifications will give you more details about ""Audio related"" design. 
(Please download the PDF here)
First of all, SPDIF and AES/EBU output will be well controlled by ultra low jitter TCXO audio clocks. Again, this is not ordinary PC music server. If you ask something even better, Geek Source Femto will provide dual audio master clocks that controls all the digital audio outputs? These Femto clocks' jitter is 100 times less the the ordinary clocks you will find on the market.The AOS (Audio optimized Operation System) is another essential part of the whole platform. We wrote the software dedicated to all audio transmission path. From CPU, to internal bus transmission, to USB 3.0 IC all the way out. The whole system boot up super fast and still kept very stable for running in weeks. DSD native output via either DSD over PCM (DoP) or native DSD protocol are all provided. Compared to the original specification we had, now we make it even higher to DSD256. Unique Dual Power DesignLarry designed a complex power supply star system for the whole Geek Source board. From the beginning of power input, we have TWO separated 12V DC input sockets. One dedicated to audio related circuit, if you have Pulse LPS4 or LPS8, that is the place you should plug-in. It will use its Super Quiet Linear Power to power up the master audio clocks (Femto clocks), USB 3.0 output part, and digital clocks transmission IC.The other socket provide the power for the rest, including CPU, WiFi, Hard drive, and our 5'' touch screen. For your convenience, if you want to plug-in one power only. That is no problem. The main power socket will automatic power up the audio power socket if there is no audio power plug-in. Chassis DesignThe design goal is to make the chassis fully integrated with your potential Vi DAC and Pulse DAC. The different element we have considered is the internal chassis volume that is good enough for air flow and mechanical hard drive. Also, our goal is to make swap hard drive in/out EASILY enough that you don't need to send back your unit. Front panel design is a complete new design of works that inherit the spirit of Vi DAC design elements. (See the ""V"" shape there). Due to the center touch screen size, it is not 100% copy and clone from Vi DAC chassis.The chassis dimension is FULL rack mount size. 16.5'' wide, with a good 4.5'' height that could fit in our 6.5'' inches lovely touch screen. The touch screen is capacitive type and has its own separate software module to work with AOS. We could separately  update this User Interface firmware when necessary. Dimension:  16.5'' (420mm) Width , 8.3'' (210mm) Depth,  4.5'' (113mm) Height.Indiegogo Crowd-design only perks* USB 3.0 Audio Output UpgradeYes. We love to provide you upgrade possibilities. Future proof. And this time, thanks for your patience for our design time. (We know it is been one year and more), we decide to make this upgrade FREE for every Geek Source backers!!

* Ultra-low ESR Power Cap Upgrade

Larry believes the best power supply is the foundation of everything. We will install 5 special low ESR Power capacitors in strategic important places for the mother board. Where is the most important places?  Core S.O.M, digital audio output and USB 3.0 port! thanks for your patience for our design time. We decide to make this upgrade FREE for every Geek Source backers!!

* Power Cap upgrade Plus: For the people who back the power cap upgrade before, We will enhance the following: Besides the 5 low ESR caps that everyone has, there will be 10 more ultra high speed PPS bypass power caps to replace the original MLCC capacitors. Bring down the 10M Hz above noise 6 dB more around the digital audio output and USB 3.0 audio output. 
Let's call it ""Power Cap upgrade Plus""!

* Geek Source Plus upgrade.  The original design in the campaign was the Intel PC architecture. Now we change to ARM core based with SOM modular design. The benefit of that is future proof. Also bring one good benefit: We don't need to boot up the operation system from hard drive. All Geek Source boot up from the EMMC flash. So in the spirit of ""Plus"" upgrade, we add the 64G ultra high speed flash as separate cache  and add more layer of cache dedicated to USB audio output usage which will further reduce the output jitter. 

* Dual Femto Clocks Upgrade
Upgrade the two audio clocks inside Geek Source to customized, lowest-jitter, USA-made Crystek TCXO clocks. This special upgrade will belong to the Indiegogo backers who pledge this upgrade during the campaign. Expect the price will be at least double for this configuration in MSRP. 
As for the third Femto clock that works with USB 3.0 output. We will update more information for the final details.



Roon and Tidal support in softwareIn our current internal beta software, we already structured a good framework for support these two great services in near future. With Roon service enabled, you could use Geek Source with local/remote music library, and works perfectly with Tidal lossless music service too. 





Current Development Progress 



[updated in Dec.8-2015]

The whole development progress is a long journey. Thanks for the support from our backers. We are able to focus on the technology improvement and make the best music server on the market. 





There are five more items need to be finished as we saw in the chart. Internal storage (hard drive) mechanical design is the target this month. And we are working with our WiFi module provider to make sure what is the problem. Software part is very time consuming but our plan is to ship something has core function smooth and add the new features via software upgrades. 
The most important thing here is definitely USB 3.0 interface. We already optimized the 5V power supply there, tested noise level is 5.7uV (20~20K), but we really hope to maximize the signal through put by the putting an even better USB 3.0 IC which has been used in many advanced industrial grade computer server.
We will keep this section updated bi-weekly until we finish all the remaining pieces.

FAQ

1. Will Geek Source support I2S over HDMI?
Answer: Yes. 
2. How Geek Source connect with Pulse DAC or Vi DAC?
Answer: You could choose from USB (preferred) or AES/EBU or Coaxial (least preferred)
3. Why design team decide to change from Intel CPU to ARM core CPU?
Answer: We tested between different platforms. ARM Core CPU's OS foot print is smaller and energy consumption is lower. So we could provide cleaner and better decoupling caps there which will lower the potential output high frequency noise. 
4. Why you let OS all run from flash instead of hard disk?
Answer: The boot up time is faster. It works quiet.  And you could make your mechanical hard drive a TOTAL music file storage. Easier for you to swap.
5. How will you guys design the power supply? Is it linear?
Answer: We will update another concise chart for power distribution. All of the core audio circuit and USB 3.0 related circuit are powered by ultra low noise linear power supply. Not a single point compromised.",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Hello friends!</h3>
<p>Here I am, humbly asking for your support to make a new record of songs written to the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay.</p>
<p>Last summer, stuck in a bit of a writing rut, I took the advice of my therapist and opened a book of poetry and sat at the piano. I had only read a poem or two of Millay in the past, but hers was the book I chose. Within 2 hours, I had written 3 songs. Our voices seemed to mingle quite well. The next day, I sat down at the piano again, re-visited the songs I had written, liked them, and decided to keep going. By the end of the third day, I had 12 songs.</p>
<p>They sat in my voice memos for about 6 months. I checked in on them once in a while, still liked them and thought, ""What am I going to do with these?"" I really connected with her writing. It is liberating to sing someone else's words, and Edna has a beautiful mix between heavy/sorrowful and light/playful.</p>
<p>One day I sat down in the studio and actually starting arranging one of the songs, ""Ashes of Life,"" and I started to get excited about this material. I started on another, ""Sorrow,"" and actually hired some horn players to give it this brassy, bluesy kind of feeling. It is so fun to build songs from the ground up and give these poems new lives.</p>
<p>So I decided I would make a record of all the songs.</p>
<p>But I need help.</p>
<h3>The Poems</h3>
<div>
<p>These are the initial twelve poems I wrote songs to:</p>

<li>She is Overheard Singing</li>
<li>Portrait by a Neighbor</li>

<li>Witch-Wife</li>
<li>The Penitent</li>
<li>Midnight Oil</li>
<li>Mariposa</li>
<li>Exiled</li>
</ul>
<p>When I played them for Sunny, he asked why there wasn't a train song, so I found one called ""Travel"" which I may include as well.</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>The easiest thing to do is to donate some money to this project. Here are some of my anticipated costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-Producer - While I can do a lot of the heavy lifting of arranging and recording these songs, I need a partner in crime to help me get the sounds I am hearing in my head, to engineer and produce my vocal performances, and to mix the songs when the recording is done.</li>
<li>Musicians - I can play a lot of the instruments, but having some other voices in the mix will give this record more variety. Horns, strings - these are things I cannot do myself</li>
<li>Mastering - when the mixes are done, the final touch to make it all sound cohesive.</li>
<li>Distribution - the first goal is to make a record for an online release, but if I were to raise enough, I would love to make a physical copy on vinyl.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>But...</h3>
<p>You are a musician and you are broke - ""Sure Mustang, I'd throw you a couple of bucks, but I haven't had a gig for a year"" - I hear you!</p>
<p>I would gladly accept a donation of a guitar part, a sax solo, or an offer to mix one of the songs. Just let me know and I'll make it work!</p>
<p>Maybe you want to come in and shoot some footage of the creation process - or make a music video! Or some album art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't throw down, either financially or artistically, I only ask that you share this campaign with anyone you think might have some interest. I really want to get these songs out into the world, and every little bit will help me reach that goal.</p>

<p>Dear beings, </p>
<p>8 years ago I packed my ’86 Ford truck, left Colorado, and moved to California in pursuit of my passions. </p>
<p>After years of working on many projects and collaborations I am now ready to branch out on my own. Music serves many mediums. I direct mine not only for songwriting, but working with meditation, children and animals.  I feel the calling to sit quiet, listen and write in a redefined space.  One that is both ageless yet young.</p>
<p>I am in the process of making my first solo record. I need your support on this journey. The funds raised will allow me to finish the production of this record! For years now I have been working with a dream that is asking to show itself in real time. There are moments I have been the observer, separate from body, and now I mold the two with the soul. I have learned recently that making music has become a practice.  Something like a ritual where I can embrace a feeling and watch it unfold. It is a place I go to out of curiosity and comfort. A place that forms the expression through the act of nurturing. A place of understanding through body and spirit. </p>
<p>So far in the process of making this record I have learned to be more gentle with myself and to listen more to the teachings of the earth. I have learned that the voice carries movement for our ancestors and those unable to speak. I see music as health and a source of therapy. I can’t wait to share this record with you.</p>

ein paar Kameras, einem Tonmischpult, etwas Filmlicht, einer guten
Campingausrüstung und ein paar Orangen im Gepäck, möchte Orange ’Ear im Mai
2015 Musik auf Island aufnehmen.
<p>Auf der einmonatigen Orange ’Ear-Tour fahren wir
von Ort zu Ort. In kleinen Ansiedlungen abseits der Ringstraße oder
in der Metropole Reykjavík bitten wir die ortsansässigen Musiker
für Orange ’Ear zu spielen. Dabei spüren wir bestimmt punkrockende Schüler,
einen immigrierten ungarischen Tenor, oder Gärtnerinnen, die virtuos
die singende Säge spielen, auf.

<span style=""color: #808080;""> Throughout the month we will be travelling from town to town. In tiny places beyond the ring road as well as in Reykjavík we are going to be asking local musicians to play for us.

kennen gelernt. Die Natur, das nordische Licht, die Mentalität und
Individualität der Menschen hat uns beeindruckt. Aber wirklich
gefangen genommen hat uns der isländische Umgang mit Musik:
<p>In diesem kleinen, zauberhaften Land
ist es eine alltägliche Selbstverständlichkeit eigene Songs zu
machen. Selbst in kleinsten Dörfern findet man Bands, die
anspruchsvolle Musik mit ganz eigenem Sound produzieren.</p>
<p>Bei unseren bisherigen
Islandaufenthalten haben wir oft erfahren, dass die Isländer gerne
spontan, bereitwillig und unkompliziert auch etwas abwegig
erscheinende Anliegen unterstützen. So fragten wir in der Tankstelle
des kleinen Ortes Flateyri in den abgelegenen Westfjorden nach dem
legendären Tonstudio Tankurinn. Über mehrere schnelle Telefonate,
einen Umweg über die Kneipe und einem Abschlusskonzert der
ortsansässigen Musikschule konnte uns der Toningenieur noch am
selben Nachmittag durch das Studio, das in einem alten runden
Betontank der ehemaligen Walstation eingebaut war, führen. Am
nächsten Abend hatte er für uns sogar eine spontane
Recordingsession mit drei Bands organisiert.</p>
<p>
<i><span style=""color: #808080;"">Over the last five years we have gotten to know Iceland through numerous trips. Its nature, the quality of its northern light, the mentality, and the people’s individuality have made an unforgettable impression on us. But what really caught us more than anything else was Iceland’s relationship to music: In this small and magical land making music is almost a part of the daily routine. Even in the tiniest of villages you can find both individuals and bands making singular and challenging music with their totally own sound.</span> <span style=""color: #808080;""></span></i></p><p><i><span style=""color: #808080;"">In our experience Icelanders often eagerly and spontaneously support even somewhat “odd” sounding projects. For example, we remember asking once at the gas station in the town of Flateyri in the remote West Fjords about the legendary Tankurinn studios. After a number of rapid phone calls, a detour through a bar, and a closing concert at the local music school, the recording engineer took us on a tour of his studio, which is built in an old round concrete tank of a former whaling station. The following evening he had even organized an impromptu recording session with three bands for us.</span></i>

unserer Leidenschaft zur Musik. Uns ist es wichtig, dass wir ohne
finanziellen Profit Musiker mit unseren Mitteln fördern und Neues
entdecken und genießen können. Bei Orange 'Ear zu Hause in Berlin können
wir die Unkosten der Konzertreihe aus eigenen Mitteln stemmen.
<p>Auch bei der Orange 'Ear-Tour tragen wir selber
die Kosten für den Aufenthalt, die Fahrten und die Produktionskosten
auf der Insel. 
</p>
<p>Um die Kosten vor Ort gering zu halten,
möchten wir mit der Autofähre Norröna nach Island fahren. So
können wir im eigenen Auto das Orange 'Ear-Equipment transportieren, es
fallen keine Kosten für ein Mietauto an und wir können mit unserer
island-erprobten Ausrüstung auf Campingplätzen übernachten.</p>
<p>Mit dieser Kampagne möchten wir die
1720 Seemeilen von Hirtshals (Dänemark) nach Seyðisfjörður (Island)
und zurück finazieren. Für eine Seemeile benötigen wir 1,50 €. So bringst Du uns schon mit einem einzigen Song (Perk)

It is important for us to be able to support musicians through our means at no financial profit and to be able to discover, and enjoy, the new.

<p></p></div>","Orange ’Ear Orange ’Ear ist eine Konzertreihe in unserer
Ladenwohnung in Berlin-Friedrichshain. Begegnen wir Musikern, die uns
beeindrucken, öffnen wir unser Wohnzimmer für ein Konzert der
besonderen Art: Die Musiker spielen bei freiem Eintritt vor
aufmerksamen Publikum in privater Atmosphäre. In unserem
videostudioartigen Set zeichnen wir die Live-Auftritte mit mehreren
Kameras und aufwendigem Soundrecording auf. Dabei sind wir ganz nah
an den Musikern dran und fangen den Live-Charakter der Performance
ein.

Orange ’Ear ist ein Non-Profit-Projekt und
stellt die veröffentlichten Live-Videos den Künstlern frei zur
Verfügung.
Orange 'Ear is a concert series that takes place in our shop/living space in Berlin-Friedrichshain. Musicians who have made a particular impression on us are invited to play for free in our living room before an attentive audience in an intimate atmosphere. We record the live performances with our video-studio-like set-up from multiple cameras and the utmost of care. We therefore remain extremely close to the musicians and are able to capture the live nature of the performances in a unique way.
Orange 'Ear is proudly Non-Profit and makes its live videos available to the artists for free.
Die Orange 'Ear-Tour Nun möchte Orange ’Ear auf Reisen gehen: Mit
ein paar Kameras, einem Tonmischpult, etwas Filmlicht, einer guten
Campingausrüstung und ein paar Orangen im Gepäck, möchte Orange ’Ear im Mai
2015 Musik auf Island aufnehmen.
Auf der einmonatigen Orange ’Ear-Tour fahren wir
von Ort zu Ort. In kleinen Ansiedlungen abseits der Ringstraße oder
in der Metropole Reykjavík bitten wir die ortsansässigen Musiker
für Orange ’Ear zu spielen. Dabei spüren wir bestimmt punkrockende Schüler,
einen immigrierten ungarischen Tenor, oder Gärtnerinnen, die virtuos
die singende Säge spielen, auf.  

Damit Du miterleben kannst, was wir
entdecken, veröffentlichen wir die auf Island produzierten Videos
auf unserer Homepage. 

But now it is time for Orange 'Ear to take to the road: with a few cameras, a mixing board, some film lights, a trustworthy bit of camping gear, and a few oranges, in May 2015 Orange 'Ear is going to go on a music recording tour of Iceland.
 Throughout the month we will be travelling from town to town. In tiny places beyond the ring road as well as in Reykjavík we are going to be asking local musicians to play for us. From punk rock playing school kids, to Hungarian tenors, and gardener – virtuosos of the singing saw  – we are open to and ready for it all. So that you can be a part of everything we discover, we will be offering the videos we produce in Iceland through our website.
Island Island haben wir in vielen Reisen
kennen gelernt. Die Natur, das nordische Licht, die Mentalität und
Individualität der Menschen hat uns beeindruckt. Aber wirklich
gefangen genommen hat uns der isländische Umgang mit Musik:
In diesem kleinen, zauberhaften Land
ist es eine alltägliche Selbstverständlichkeit eigene Songs zu
machen. Selbst in kleinsten Dörfern findet man Bands, die
anspruchsvolle Musik mit ganz eigenem Sound produzieren.
Bei unseren bisherigen
Islandaufenthalten haben wir oft erfahren, dass die Isländer gerne
spontan, bereitwillig und unkompliziert auch etwas abwegig
erscheinende Anliegen unterstützen. So fragten wir in der Tankstelle
des kleinen Ortes Flateyri in den abgelegenen Westfjorden nach dem
legendären Tonstudio Tankurinn. Über mehrere schnelle Telefonate,
einen Umweg über die Kneipe und einem Abschlusskonzert der
ortsansässigen Musikschule konnte uns der Toningenieur noch am
selben Nachmittag durch das Studio, das in einem alten runden
Betontank der ehemaligen Walstation eingebaut war, führen. Am
nächsten Abend hatte er für uns sogar eine spontane
Recordingsession mit drei Bands organisiert.

Over the last five years we have gotten to know Iceland through numerous trips. Its nature, the quality of its northern light, the mentality, and the people’s individuality have made an unforgettable impression on us. But what really caught us more than anything else was Iceland’s relationship to music: In this small and magical land making music is almost a part of the daily routine. Even in the tiniest of villages you can find both individuals and bands making singular and challenging music with their totally own sound. In our experience Icelanders often eagerly and spontaneously support even somewhat “odd” sounding projects. For example, we remember asking once at the gas station in the town of Flateyri in the remote West Fjords about the legendary Tankurinn studios. After a number of rapid phone calls, a detour through a bar, and a closing concert at the local music school, the recording engineer took us on a tour of his studio, which is built in an old round concrete tank of a former whaling station. The following evening he had even organized an impromptu recording session with three bands for us.
Das FundingWir betreiben Orange 'Ear seit 5 Jahren aus
unserer Leidenschaft zur Musik. Uns ist es wichtig, dass wir ohne
finanziellen Profit Musiker mit unseren Mitteln fördern und Neues
entdecken und genießen können. Bei Orange 'Ear zu Hause in Berlin können
wir die Unkosten der Konzertreihe aus eigenen Mitteln stemmen.
Auch bei der Orange 'Ear-Tour tragen wir selber
die Kosten für den Aufenthalt, die Fahrten und die Produktionskosten
auf der Insel. 

Um die Kosten vor Ort gering zu halten,
möchten wir mit der Autofähre Norröna nach Island fahren. So
können wir im eigenen Auto das Orange 'Ear-Equipment transportieren, es
fallen keine Kosten für ein Mietauto an und wir können mit unserer
island-erprobten Ausrüstung auf Campingplätzen übernachten.
Mit dieser Kampagne möchten wir die
1720 Seemeilen von Hirtshals (Dänemark) nach Seyðisfjörður (Island)
und zurück finazieren. Für eine Seemeile benötigen wir 1,50 €. So bringst Du uns schon mit einem einzigen Song (Perk) 
3,33333333333333333333333333333333333333 Seemeilen dem Traum Orange 'Ear to Iceland
näher.


We have been running Orange 'Ear for five years because of our passion for music. It is important for us to be able to support musicians through our means at no financial profit and to be able to discover, and enjoy, the new. At our home in Berlin, Orange 'Ear is able to cover the costs of the concert series on its own. And even on the Orange 'Ear-Tour we will cover all of the housing, travel, and production costs ourselves. In order to keep costs down, however, we plan to take the auto-ferry Norröna over to Iceland. That way we will be able to transport Orange 'Ear’s equipment in our car, and we can use our foreknowledge of Iceland to plan overnight stays at campsites. The point of this campaign is to finance the actual 1720-nautical-mile trip from Hirtshals (Denmark) to Seyðisfjörður (Iceland) and back. One nautical mile costs €1.50.
 Therefore, with the purchase of just a single song you can already bring us 3,33333333333333333333333333333333333333 nautical miles closer to our dream!(English translation by Alexander  Booth)

This adds the additional cost of new medication as well and a very exspensive diet her Dr are putting her on. It is even more important we keep the studio running, and supporting itself, so we can not only continue to help other children, but also our own. </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>My name is Adam Sandberg, and I currently own and operate Another Element Recordings with my wife Kelly. Another Element Recordings is fully functional recording studio for all audio needs. I have 15+ years of experience in the music industry, and 8+ years of experience in the Audio Engineering field. A lot of our studio time is donated to helping children with special needs find their voice through music, and well as also giving at risk youth a positive place to showcase their talents as well as learn engineering skills. Any income we receive over covering the bills, we use for additional income to help our family.</p><p>Originally we had 6 children of our own, and then we adopted a family member after finding out she was placed in Foster Care. We then took on 2 more children that were family members for the exact same reason. When there is a big travesty in your life at such a young age there also come’s big issues and problems to try and overcome. Due to these circumstances we have dealt with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Reactive Attachment Disorder, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) from severe neglect and abuse. On top of all these obstacles we are dealing with we also have 3 children on the Autism Spectrum. So due to these circumstances my wife stays home and takes care of the children and their needs such as doctor’s appointments, counseling, med checks, and she also homeschools some of them.</p><p>During the day I work as the Revenue Accountant for the local Food Bank, and at night I work as a producer/Audio Engineer. I work 80+ hours a week so I can take care of my family and provide them with the things they need. My family is the most important thing in my life! So in actuality you would really be helping my family.</p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>Currently, we are setting a goal of $5,000.00. Here is a breakdown of what we intend to use the money for:</p><p>· Rental Security for at least 6 months.</p><p>· Marketing for the studio such as a website, flyers, ads for promotion, and any other ways we can get the name out for our studio.</p><p>· A better grade of microphones for drums, vocal sessions, and other instrument recording needs. This will help in recording a better quality sound.</p><p>· Better quality audio interfaces for more microphone inputs so we can capture the audio at a better quality sample rate.</p><p>· If any money is left over after these purchases we hope to acquire additional instruments such as guitars, basses, drum sets, amplifiers, and speaker cabinets for guitar and bass. This helps give the clientele different choices in producing a sound they may not have.</p><p>Also, if no one can contribute financially any expertise advice, used equipment, or anything is extremely appreciated.</p><p>Unfortunately, I’m not quite sure what I could offer anyone as a perk for your contribution. However, one thing I would like to do for each person that contributes would be a personal thank you letter as well as picture of the studio with my family inside showing the progress of your donation. I know it's not much, but that is all I really have to offer at this point.</p><p>If for some reason we cannot reach our goal, any funds that come our way will be used in a prioritized list in order to help maintain our studio.</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p><p>If you chose to help us in efforts to obtain new recording hardware, new computer, and the deposit for our new facility we would be eternally grateful.

This adds the additional cost of new medication as well and a very exspensive diet her Dr are putting her on. It is even more important we keep the studio running, and supporting itself, so we can not only continue to help other children, but also our own. My name is Adam Sandberg, and I currently own and operate Another Element Recordings with my wife Kelly. Another Element Recordings is fully functional recording studio for all audio needs. I have 15+ years of experience in the music industry, and 8+ years of experience in the Audio Engineering field. A lot of our studio time is donated to helping children with special needs find their voice through music, and well as also giving at risk youth a positive place to showcase their talents as well as learn engineering skills. Any income we receive over covering the bills, we use for additional income to help our family.Originally we had 6 children of our own, and then we adopted a family member after finding out she was placed in Foster Care. We then took on 2 more children that were family members for the exact same reason. When there is a big travesty in your life at such a young age there also come’s big issues and problems to try and overcome. Due to these circumstances we have dealt with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Reactive Attachment Disorder, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) from severe neglect and abuse. On top of all these obstacles we are dealing with we also have 3 children on the Autism Spectrum. So due to these circumstances my wife stays home and takes care of the children and their needs such as doctor’s appointments, counseling, med checks, and she also homeschools some of them.During the day I work as the Revenue Accountant for the local Food Bank, and at night I work as a producer/Audio Engineer. I work 80+ hours a week so I can take care of my family and provide them with the things they need. My family is the most important thing in my life! So in actuality you would really be helping my family.What We Need & What You GetCurrently, we are setting a goal of $5,000.00. Here is a breakdown of what we intend to use the money for:· Rental Security for at least 6 months.· Marketing for the studio such as a website, flyers, ads for promotion, and any other ways we can get the name out for our studio.· A better grade of microphones for drums, vocal sessions, and other instrument recording needs. This will help in recording a better quality sound.· Better quality audio interfaces for more microphone inputs so we can capture the audio at a better quality sample rate.· If any money is left over after these purchases we hope to acquire additional instruments such as guitars, basses, drum sets, amplifiers, and speaker cabinets for guitar and bass. This helps give the clientele different choices in producing a sound they may not have.Also, if no one can contribute financially any expertise advice, used equipment, or anything is extremely appreciated.Unfortunately, I’m not quite sure what I could offer anyone as a perk for your contribution. However, one thing I would like to do for each person that contributes would be a personal thank you letter as well as picture of the studio with my family inside showing the progress of your donation. I know it's not much, but that is all I really have to offer at this point.If for some reason we cannot reach our goal, any funds that come our way will be used in a prioritized list in order to help maintain our studio.The ImpactIf you chose to help us in efforts to obtain new recording hardware, new computer, and the deposit for our new facility we would be eternally grateful. Having these items would help us develop ourselves to the next level of this profession. With better equipment and a well-maintained facility we can offer more to potential clients, which can produce more income for my family and help with gas to get them to appointments, medicine refills, doctor bills, etc.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute financially I would greatly appreciate it if you could share this link with your friends. The greater amount of people that are aware of our situation the more it could potentially help my family, Another Element Recordings, and me. Also, if you happen to have any music equipment you can donate or know of someone who could donate music equipment to us, which would help us out greatly in our campaign.Thank you from the bottom of my heart, in any support you can provide.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>On Saturday May 9, at 10PM, “Guitar”
George Baker will take the stage at Cafe Nine in New Haven, CT for “A Night to
Remember.” The concert will be the occasion of a very rare, live, multi-track
recording of George and his band. The purpose of this Indiegogo campaign
is to help raise funds to pay for recording the show, and the associated
post-production and manufacturing costs for making a CD featuring selected
performances from the show. We are trying to raise $2000 to supplement the money raised from ticket sales to the event.</p>
<p>You can hear George tell his
own story in the video for this campaign, but here is a snapshot - he was
raised in Louisiana, and has been a guitarist (jazz, blues, R&amp;B) and singer
for nearly 50 years. George was in the House Band at the Apollo Theatre in
Harlem, toured with Melba Moore, performed with the Drifters, the Flamingos and
others in and around New York, and had a two-year stint as music director and
guitarist for Marvin Gaye (1968 - 1970.) He moved to Connecticut in the mid-80s,
and has been performing in the region since.</p>
<p>In a career full of milestones,
May 9th will be an important one: the first-ever recording of a live
performance by George with his own band, for CD and download. The album will be
only his second album as a leader. George released “Mojo Lady” in 2006.</p>
<p>Performing with George will
be: Willie Moore on bass; Derrick Tappin on drums; Nick Lloyd on keyboards; Lou
Ianello on tenor saxophone; and Tony Dioguardi on guitar.</p>
<p>Please join us in helping to
make this recording a reality! Anything you give will be helpful.</p><p>Tickets for the show are available here:</p><p><a href=""http://ticketf.ly/1CWSiMG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://ticketf.ly/1CWSiMG</a><br/></p><p><br/></p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Burn is a large R&amp;B original music band led by Tom Pergola, who is also the band's Songwriter, Producer, and Guitarist.

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>Hello there!!! My name is Rebeka Kashkin, I am a junior Television-Radio student at Ithaca College, and I have a focus in audio production and design. For my audio capstone/thesis, I will be producing a 4 song EP. In addition to being my capstone, this project is also being produced partially to serve as the soundtrack/score of a cinema thesis, directed by Bass Conde, that will be in production later this year. </p>
<p>This EP is experimental and conceptual in nature, as we are composing it to ideally mimic the story beats of the script. We plan to incorporate elements of sound design, ambient recording, and both analog and digital recording and mixing techniques. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where is my donation going?</h3>
<p>You might be wondering why I need donations for this project. I am fortunate enough to attend a school that offers me both facilities and industry-standard equipment to use for projects, free of charge. However, there are a few supplemental costs we need to cover.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer of paying artists for their effort and time. While many students will work for free, I intend to pay each recording artist a flat rate of $75 for composition, and $100 for a studio session. This totals out to $700, accounting for all the artists that we will be working with. We have also worked in an extra $100, to cover costs in case artists need to come back into the studio and re-record.</p>
<p>Aside from that cost, which is the majority of our budget, we have also accounted for a total of $200, to cover any distribution and production costs. This covers streaming services, as well as creating physical media, such as CDs and cassettes. </p>
</div><div>
<p>By donating this project, you will be supporting all the local artists we are working with, as well as helping supplement some of the unexpected costs of a thesis production (which, believe me, they add up). </p>
<p>Also, we have a bunch of cool perks for donating! Want your name in a song? We have a perk for that! Want to full on NAME an ENTIRE song? There's a perk for that too! Do you love the preservation of physical media? We have CDs and cassettes up for grabs! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have roughly a two-month timeline to compose, record, edit, and mix this entire album. This time crunch is definitely the biggest hurdle in our way. Additionally, as mentioned briefly above, we plan to use analog recording technology. While I do have some experience with analog interfaces, a lot of research and practice will have to be conducted in order to get a quality result. This process will be time-consuming within an already stress-inducing time crunch.</p>

<h3>About this project...</h3>
<p>A lot has happened in this country since I released <i>The Lumberjack </i>a year ago<i>.</i> The Global Change Climate Program released its 4th annual Climate Assessment, Toledo Ohio granted human rights to Lake Eerie, the Senate designated 1.3 million acres of wilderness, and the state of Illinois rolled out an agenda to achieve zero carbon by 2050.</p>
<p>Last summer's tour took us around the country and up through Canada. We passed through the smoke of America's most punishing wildfire season in history, stood 30 yards from where lightning struck land during an extreme precipitation event Texas, and narrowly avoided the devastating floods of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The climate is changing and that's what this album is about. </p>
<p>My name is Eleanor Elektra and I am a singer songwriter and interdisciplinary artist. I have been expressing my connection with nature through music since I started writing songs as a teen. This will be my third release to date and my most ambitious project yet! But more on that later; the inspiration for this album first came to me when I was 16 years old, in the form of a Norse genesis story wherein the earth is born from the corpse of a giant named Ymir. Ymir’s flesh becomes the earth, his blood the rivers, his brains the clouds, his skull the sky. His blood drowns the inhabitants of the world except for two of his offspring who float away in a sea of gore.</p>
<p>Five years later I did an ""exquisite corpse"" cowrite with a fellow songwriter; we passed the notebook back and forth writing lyrical passages, and the metaphors that conceived these songs came from this.</p>
<p>The Exquisite Corpse is about things that are started by one generation and taken up by another, it’s about the struggling condition of the earth. The Exquisite Corpse is also the cycle of death and regeneration. It’s a way of looking at the Earth that says one thing ends, another begins, and it is also a call to action, compelling us to bring an end to the paradigm of exploitation so a paradigm of restoration can begin. It is the concept of Nature as a body, and it holds physical and spiritual implications about the current condition of the Earth and what it means to us.  </p>

<h3>About the impact of your support...</h3>
<p>Funding for this project will help bring a new work of art to fruition. This album is meant to contribute to a cultural force that sanctifies Nature—something that has been alternately feared and exploited by the western world for centuries. This task is indelibly related to sustainability, because it shapes the way we treat our planet. The global community does not have much time to drastically change the way it operates and we need to work quickly; this is the reality that my generation has grown up with and now, as young adults, we are closing in on an ultimatum. As an artist, I've been drawn to expressions of nature again and again over the years by a sense of awe, urgency and justice. </p>
<p>My sound has definitely grown since recording my solo EP <i>Comet </i>on a field recorder in the hills. Arranging these strange songs for an ensemble is not a simple task! But working with these musicians has been such a joy and an incredible learning experience. This record is pushing me to a new level of music and leadership that will bring forth transformative year with your generous support. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is slated to take about a year to complete, and what I'm raising here through indiegogo is just part of the total costs! In the next nine months, I plant to save $6,000 from the two day jobs I hold down to help pay for everything. Managing those jobs, preventing surprise expenses from piling up, and making sure the agenda stays organized and rolling, will be a challenge. But things are looking good so far, as I've already squirreled away $3,000 for this project and managed to keep all the moving parts in working order! Releasing my last album <i>The Lumberjack </i>and touring extensively this past year taught me that things don't always go as planned, and stuff happens on the road, but it also taught me how to deal!</p>

<p>On March 14, 2016 the
Philadelphia music community lost a dear, long-time friend: clarinetist,
composer, and conductor <a href=""http://www.arnerunning.com/biography.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arne Running</a> who passed away at age 72 following an
illness. </p>
<p>Arne was a well-loved and
respected colleague who had a multi-faceted career as a clarinetist with
numerous Philadelphia ensembles, as a composer who wrote pieces for many local
music groups (including Orchestra 2001), and as a conductor who formerly led
orchestras at Swarthmore College and elsewhere in the area.
His presence in our local community will be sorely missed.</p>

</div>","On March 14, 2016 the
Philadelphia music community lost a dear, long-time friend: clarinetist,
composer, and conductor Arne Running who passed away at age 72 following an
illness. 
Arne was a well-loved and
respected colleague who had a multi-faceted career as a clarinetist with
numerous Philadelphia ensembles, as a composer who wrote pieces for many local
music groups (including Orchestra 2001), and as a conductor who formerly led
orchestras at Swarthmore College and elsewhere in the area.
His presence in our local community will be sorely missed.
Orchestra 2001 would like
to honor Arne by asking his musical friends and colleagues to contribute, in
his memory, to our newly-created Clarinet Chair, the ""Friends and Colleagues Chair in Memory
of Clarinetist, Composer, and Conductor Arne Running.”

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>When I was in first grade, every day at recess I was singing on the swings and singing at the top of my lungs. Somewhere in a dusty old box my parents have a videotape of me at 3 years old, in a pink leotard singing opera to Gloria Estefan's ""Miami Sound Machine"", on my ""stage"" AKA the fireplace. (Yes this video actually exists and it is HILARIOUS!) I have known all my life that this is what I was put on this earth to do. I am so lucky that I have had the chance to make a living and see the world doing what I love. Now that I am all grown up I realize what music can mean to people and how powerful it is. That is really what makes me love what I do everyday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. Although I always sang, I started out my musical education studying the violin then moved on to drums, then piano, with a few experiments in guitar, and bass. I began my singing endeavors with the Columbus Children's Chorus singing with the Columbus Symphony at age 10. By the time I was ready to graduate high school I found that singing would always be my first love. In the fall of 2002 I attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. It was there that I began to develop my artistic style and I had this crazy notion that maybe jazz vocalists don't have to just sing the standards, solo over ""A"" then come back in on the bridge. So I began to write original songs, arrangements of popular songs, and dive into the ever expanding world of improvisation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am not just a vocalist I am an instrument. I like to use my voice as a storyteller whether through improvisation or through the delivery of lyrics. My stance as an artist is that the music should make people feel something! Jazz shouldn't be approached just from the technical side. I do believe in substance but music that doesn't speak to the heart won't move people and I don't see the point. People connect to a song when it identifies with a piece of their humanity. That is what I try to do. I want to bring joy and excitement to people making every performance an experience to remember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my professional career, I have been privileged to share the stage with an extraordinary array of musicians such as Kurt Elling, Ellis Marsalis, Meredith Monk, Sheila E., Esperanza Spalding, Riannon, and Bryan Baker.<span style=""""> As well as small club performances some of my </span>past performances include The Montreux Jazz Festival, where I was awarded second place in the 2007 vocal competition, The Beantown Jazz Festival, The Boston Pops Jazz Festival, and The International Association of Jazz Educators Convention. In addition to live performances, I have been interviewed as a featured artist on Boston’s 89.7 WGBH National Public Radio. This year I was chosen for the Betty Carter Jazz Ahead Arts In Residence Program at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. While focusing on performance, I have also become a deeply committed educator, dedicating my life to the preservation and promotion of American Jazz and its history to future generations.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let's face it we live in the digital age where everything is available electronically. Record labels don't make the money they used to and many artists are promoting and recording independently. The one thing that helps an independent artist make it to the next level is having a professional recording! Come on, be honest we have enough plastic bubblegum culture out there. With all the constraints of the current economic times people want things simpler, faster, and easier with that the quality of our entertainment has gone down. Musicians are getting paid less and less or even being replaced by machines. Now auto tune can make anyone a star! This project is about promoting real live music and real art! if you are paying the money to go out to a club, buy a record, or see a concert...THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE DAMN GOOD! This is bigger then just my career. Plain and simple, if we don't raise money for projects like this then the substance of our culture just keeps getting degraded further and further. Let's support quality!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It is extremely expensive to make, produce, promote and distribute an album! Record labels spend tens of thousands (sometimes a hundred thousand) dollars on an artist's record cycle. My goal is $7000. Lofty as it may seem, this is what is needed to make this special project and if everyone gives $10 or even $25 we will meet, and even possibly exceed the goal! You don't give for nothing.....you get all sorts of cool prizes. Anything from a free digital download, to lyric sheets, to a mix tape, to original artwork, or a free private concert! The larger the contribution the better the perks. Credit card donations are accepted. We can do it!!</p>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>We are Crossroads Duo, an acoustic blues duo performing both original and cover blues music. We have been performing blues music individually for decades and since September, 2015 as Crossroads Duo.

We will incur gasoline, food and hotel room expenses for an entire week. As none of the IBC performances pay and both of us will have to leave our other musical gigs for a week (guitar instructor, radio host) we will need your help to get us to Memphis AND sustain us for the week until we return to our regular jobs and our Crossroads Duo gigs that DO pay...</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $3,000 to cover our expenses of gasoline (we're driving there), food (for the whole week) and hotel room (for 6 days). As stated above, we will not be able to work our paying gigs (guitar instructor, radio host and of course Crossroads Duo paid gigs) for the entire week so not only do we need to get ourselves to Memphis and back but we will not have any income for the week. Just to be able to compete in the IBC is a huge thing for the duo. The prestige of performing there we hope will carry us to the next level of the blues music scene. In exchange for your kind contribution you will receive any of the perks we have listed which include autographed posters, CDs, and souvenir memorabilia from our respective instruments...</p>

She gave the entire message with big hand-drawn cards, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">like Bob Dylan in his 60‘s video, “Subterranean Homesick Blues” .<br/></span></b><b>And what is so brilliant about all this? It connects the artist directly with the listener. The challenging side is that I wear all the hats: Visionary, composer, performer, producer, pioneer, manager and fund-raiser!

In fact, this project, PEACE IS NOW, could be my “piece de resistance”, a culmination of many years of visions and dreams. I hope you can help me bring it to life!

WHY INDIEGOGO?

So why a crowdfunding campaign? Over the last couple of years, I have been so inspired by the success of other artists using this fundraising tool; Todd Boston produced a beautiful CD with Will Ackerman, Brindle ran a successful campaign for her music, Jumana in Ashland, Oregon raised funds to launch her amazing water therapy center, Onyay Pheori from Los Angeles raised money for her beautiful violin music and of course the famous Amanda Palmer raised $1.2 million & never spoke a word on the video! She gave the entire message with big hand-drawn cards, like Bob Dylan in his 60‘s video, “Subterranean Homesick Blues” .And what is so brilliant about all this? It connects the artist directly with the listener. The challenging side is that I wear all the hats: Visionary, composer, performer, producer, pioneer, manager and fund-raiser! As you can see, I can use and appreciate all of your support.

<p><span><i><b>About
Progressive Rock</b></i></span></p>
<p>Progressive rock, or
“prog rock”, is a rock music subgenre originated in the UK in the late 1960s.
Progressive rock is characterized by its complex sound of rock fused with
diverse elements, such as classical, jazz, and/or contemporary music.  Ma<span style=""background-color: initial;"">jor bands of
progressive rock include Yes, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis, and Emerson,
Lake &amp; Palmer.</span></p>
<p>Progressive rock is not a
popular genre in Japan. But, in Europe and the US, the music is regarded as an
established genre, and supported by a wide range of generations, as well as
youth.

<h3>
<br/>Biography</h3>
<p>Formed in 2009, Yuka
&amp; Chronoship is led by Yuka Funakoshi, a rare female artist in the genre,
and consists of three other leading studio musicians in Japan: Shun Taguchi,
Miyazawa Takashi, and Ikko Tanaka.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465276069/yuka_and_chronoship_artist_photo_2015_02_cvtl98.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>&lt; Photo from

Producer)<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Shun made a debut in 1980. As a member of bands such as Lorelei and Sense of
Wonder, he released seven albums. From 1982, he started to provide lyrics to
many Japanese artists, and later on work as a producer. He has been working as
a producer of Yuka Funakoshi since her debut, and had also worked as a producer
of Princess Princess, a five-piece Japanese pop/rock girl band.</span></p>
<p>■<span>  </span>Takashi Miyazawa (Guitar / Mix)<br/>
Takashi had worked as a studio musician for some projects led by Masataka
Matsutoya, a Japanese arranger, composer, music producer. He is also working as
a composer/arranger of TV commercial and game music. Takashi did the mixing of
2<span style=""font-size: 12px;line-height: 0px;"">nd</span> and 3<span style=""font-size: 12px;line-height: 0px;"">rd</span> albums of Yuka &amp; Chronoship.

</p>
<p><span>■<span>  </span>Yuka Funakoshi (Keyboard/Vocal/Composition)<br/>
As a singer-songwriter, Yuka had released three J-pop albums from Pioneer LDC
and Sony. She also had worked as a radio personality, and composed incidental

Himuro, and Namie Amuro.<br/><br/></span></p>
<h3>Discography</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Yuka &amp; Chronoship’s
1st album, “Water Reincarnation”, was released in June 2011, and their 2nd
album, “Dino Rocket Oxygen”, in April 2013 from the French progressive label,
Musea. In September, 2015, the band released their 3rd </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">album, “The 3rd </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Planetary Chronicles” from Cherry Red Records in the U.K.</span><br/></p>
<p><b><i>Water Reincarnation</i></b></p>
<p>As a country consisting
of four main islands surrounded by the sea, Japan has long benefited, but at
times greatly suffered from water from the ancient times. This album depicts
such an ever-recurring water cycle. From an almost cosmic perspective and with
technical and musical richness, this grandiose concept-album portrays the
reincarnation of water. The rain is turned into a river; a river pours into the
sea; the sea then forms clouds; and clouds are turned back into the rain.<br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfOCJxNfegDA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfOCJxNfegDA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfOCJxNfegDA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><b style=""background-color: initial;""><i>DINO ROCKET OXYGEN</i></b><br/><p></p>
<p>The album is made of
three suites: “Dinosaur Suite”, “R is for Rocket Suite”, and “Oxygen Suite”.
Compared to the 1st, this album’s arrangement gives it more of a touch of band
sound. The band &amp; title logo are designed by Roger Dean, an iconic
progressive rock artist who has created many covers of legendary progressive
rock bands.<br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAgU2b1f7HqU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAgU2b1f7HqU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAgU2b1f7HqU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i><b>About Roger Dean</b></i></span><br/><p></p>

In September, 2015, Yuka
& Chronoship made their UK debut with their 3rd album, “The 3rd Planetary Chronicles”. Since then, there have been so many requests for the
album’s music video from the fans and the media overseas. The band now decided
to make the music video to extend their popularity.

Yuka & Chronoship is
a Japanese progressive rock band that made a UK debut with their 3rd album, “The 3rd Planetary Chronicles”, from Cherry Red Records in
September, 2015. Yuka & Chronoship is
the first Japanese artist to release its album from a semi-major label in the birthplace
of progressive rock. Since its release, the album has received enthusiastic
responses. Especially in UK and other European countries, the album has been
rated with four and five stars from the media. In no more than two weeks after
the release, 1,000 copies of the album have been sold and picked up by more
than 70 radio stations and internet media.

As there have been
mounting requests for the album’s music video especially from the overseas
media, the band now decided to make its music video to expand its popularity
overseas.
With your support, we
want to create an attractive music video that enchants the whole world, and
mark the beginning of a new chronicle that puts Yuka & Chronoship on the
center stage of the world’s progressive rock scene.


About
Progressive Rock
Progressive rock, or
“prog rock”, is a rock music subgenre originated in the UK in the late 1960s.
Progressive rock is characterized by its complex sound of rock fused with
diverse elements, such as classical, jazz, and/or contemporary music.  Major bands of
progressive rock include Yes, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis, and Emerson,
Lake & Palmer.
Progressive rock is not a
popular genre in Japan. But, in Europe and the US, the music is regarded as an
established genre, and supported by a wide range of generations, as well as
youth.

Discography

Yuka & Chronoship’s
1st album, “Water Reincarnation”, was released in June 2011, and their 2nd
album, “Dino Rocket Oxygen”, in April 2013 from the French progressive label,
Musea. In September, 2015, the band released their 3rd album, “The 3rd Planetary Chronicles” from Cherry Red Records in the U.K.
Water Reincarnation
As a country consisting
of four main islands surrounded by the sea, Japan has long benefited, but at
times greatly suffered from water from the ancient times. This album depicts
such an ever-recurring water cycle. From an almost cosmic perspective and with
technical and musical richness, this grandiose concept-album portrays the
reincarnation of water. The rain is turned into a river; a river pours into the
sea; the sea then forms clouds; and clouds are turned back into the rain.DINO ROCKET OXYGEN
The album is made of
three suites: “Dinosaur Suite”, “R is for Rocket Suite”, and “Oxygen Suite”.
Compared to the 1st, this album’s arrangement gives it more of a touch of band
sound. The band & title logo are designed by Roger Dean, an iconic
progressive rock artist who has created many covers of legendary progressive
rock bands.About Roger Dean
Roger Dean is an English
painter, illustrator, and art designer. He became widely known for his album
cover work for Yes’s 4th album, “Fragile”, with the touch of fantasy that
perfectly matches the theme of the album. In addition to many other album
covers of Yes, he created a variety of album artworks of Uriah Heep, Gentle
Giant, and other progressive rock bands. He also designed Virgin Records
(original) logo and label.   http://www.rogerdean.com/


The 3rd Planetary Chronicles

The band’s 3rd album,
“The 3rd Planetary Chronicles”, is a grandiose concept album themed with
scientific/technological revolutions in the history of the Earth (the third
planet from the Sun). The album’s booklet is designed by Hideji Oda, a reputed
manga artist/illustrator of “Diffusion Disease”, “Coo’s World”, and “Miyori no
Mori”.

quality of this memorable UK debut album, the band used MotionGallery
crowdfunding. With the album made possible with many crowdfunding contributors,

<h2>THE BAND</h2>
<h3>MACHINAE SUPREMACY – where machines rule!</h3>
<p>In the dawn of online distribution a small Swedish group appeared on the digital horizon and raised an army of retro gamers and metal warriors. Their music combines classic power metal and other nordic influences with the chiptune melody and soundscape of the ‘80s. Ladies and gentlemen, I present you Machinae Supremacy.</p>
<h3>INCEPTION</h3>
<p>The year is 20xx when a team in Luleå wants to create something outstanding. This is before the era of YouTube and online music sharing is still in its infancy. It was a bold move to make their first works available for free. And they succeeded! At the time of their first album, produced by a major publisher (Spinefarm) the downloads exceeded millions and their fame skyrocketed in geek circles. Some can’t even fathom that all of this happened before the age of online streaming and yet managed to reach a wide audience. Machinae Supremacy is the living proof of the creative community bonding powers of the internet. They are the heralds of amateur content creation gone professional. This, of course, couldn’t have happened without the world wide web. The recipe is simple. At the home of “In Flames” every computer network hosts a fair amount of melodic and fierce metal music. The boys cranked this up to 11 by introducing a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektron_SidStation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SIDStation</a>, a synthesiser utilising the sound chip of the legendary C64. Today it is expected to hear serious symphonic interludes and sophisticated chiptune segments alike.</p>
<h3>MODERN QUALITY METAL</h3>
<p>Following their initial success, they had their fair share of tours. They are recurring guests at Scandinavian demoparties, eSports leagues and the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2D8Mxs_XOI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Play! A Video Game Symphony”</a> concerts. They also had the opportunity to share the stage with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. In the meantime, they made music for the indie shmup <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gof24qfxsro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Jets ‘n’ Guns”</a>, worked on the music for the reimagined <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xckhXilEzTs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bionic Commando</a> by Capcom, a new <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9zuxmwwGs0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Giana Sisters”</a> title and they celebrated Zelda’s 30th birthday with a cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrZRg4R8Qx0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Gerudo Valley”</a>. A good indication of their outstanding creativity and dedication to quality is the fact that Plogue (the creators of the famed VST synth plugin <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdAZ5IoaR4o&amp;amp;list=PLB96D20AC8CC3A55D"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chipsounds</a>) is among their prestigious sponsors - such as Jackson Guitars and Asus’ Republic of Gamers brand. The Swedish pixel warriors are no strangers to Hungary. If we get the support we need they will grace us with their presence yet again.</p>
<h3>MEET THE LEGACY</h3>
<p>To this very day, one can download a tremendous amount of material from the band’s <a href=""http://machinaesupremacy.com/tagged/download"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, for free of course. Their colourful collection - titled <a href=""http://machinaesupremacy.com/post/110484247970/echoes-compilation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Echoes</a> - absolutely left a mark on the metal-chiptune crossover genre and inspired a great line of artists. If you are looking for an even more substantial experience I recommend following it up with the free album called <a href=""http://machinaesupremacy.com/albums/deus-ex-machinae"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Deux Ex Machinae”</a>.  This being their first quasi-professional album it stands as a homage to such gaming classics as the intro to Final Fantasy VI closed by the track Flagcarrier. If this still wasn’t enough head to <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/machinae-supremacy/id202781028"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ITunes</a>, <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Machinae_Supremacy?id=Ao5edgb6ixgezrlgt35pnze3fia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google Play Music</a> or to your preferred platform and blast the triumvirate of “Redeemer”-”Overworld”-”A view from” all day long!</p>

<h2>THE ORGANISER</h2>
<h3>Improving gaming communities with fun</h3>
<p>The main goal of Insert Coin Association for Video Game Culture (founded in 2013) is to improve the local gaming community. <a href=""http://insert-coin.hu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://insert-coin.hu/</a> (non-profit organisation)</p>
<p>PixelCon is our video game cultural party brand.</p>
<p>PixelCon is not a commercial event selling the latest gamer stuff, nor a gaming history exhibition. PixelCon presents the real values of gaming culture, the fun experience. Not only by showcasing these video games but with fostering any creative manifestation that has roots in it: like video game music.</p>
<p>This is why the live music acts are among the most important parts of PixelCon parties. Loud video game music blows your mind!</p>

<h3>The most expensive part</h3>
<p>Previously 75% of the PixelCon parties' budget has been used for the concerts.</p>
<p>Some said this is unfair against those who don't want to stay until the concert and don't want to pay the full price PixelCon ticket.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the budget is bigger the financial risk is higher.</p>
<p>For the next PixelCon we've invited the famous Swedish band MACHINAE SUPREMACY. Following the will of the Insert Coin Association members, we have to handle the financial risks by raising the money for this show via crowdfunding.</p>
<p>If it succeeds, this show will blow your mind. But if it fails, we won't charge the backers and we have to give up on the MaSu concert.</p>

THE BAND
MACHINAE SUPREMACY – where machines rule!
In the dawn of online distribution a small Swedish group appeared on the digital horizon and raised an army of retro gamers and metal warriors. Their music combines classic power metal and other nordic influences with the chiptune melody and soundscape of the ‘80s. Ladies and gentlemen, I present you Machinae Supremacy.
INCEPTION
The year is 20xx when a team in Luleå wants to create something outstanding. This is before the era of YouTube and online music sharing is still in its infancy. It was a bold move to make their first works available for free. And they succeeded! At the time of their first album, produced by a major publisher (Spinefarm) the downloads exceeded millions and their fame skyrocketed in geek circles. Some can’t even fathom that all of this happened before the age of online streaming and yet managed to reach a wide audience. Machinae Supremacy is the living proof of the creative community bonding powers of the internet. They are the heralds of amateur content creation gone professional. This, of course, couldn’t have happened without the world wide web. The recipe is simple. At the home of “In Flames” every computer network hosts a fair amount of melodic and fierce metal music. The boys cranked this up to 11 by introducing a SIDStation, a synthesiser utilising the sound chip of the legendary C64. Today it is expected to hear serious symphonic interludes and sophisticated chiptune segments alike.
MODERN QUALITY METAL
Following their initial success, they had their fair share of tours. They are recurring guests at Scandinavian demoparties, eSports leagues and the “Play! A Video Game Symphony” concerts. They also had the opportunity to share the stage with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. In the meantime, they made music for the indie shmup “Jets ‘n’ Guns”, worked on the music for the reimagined Bionic Commando by Capcom, a new “Giana Sisters” title and they celebrated Zelda’s 30th birthday with a cover of “Gerudo Valley”. A good indication of their outstanding creativity and dedication to quality is the fact that Plogue (the creators of the famed VST synth plugin Chipsounds) is among their prestigious sponsors - such as Jackson Guitars and Asus’ Republic of Gamers brand. The Swedish pixel warriors are no strangers to Hungary. If we get the support we need they will grace us with their presence yet again.
MEET THE LEGACY
To this very day, one can download a tremendous amount of material from the band’s website, for free of course. Their colourful collection - titled Echoes - absolutely left a mark on the metal-chiptune crossover genre and inspired a great line of artists. If you are looking for an even more substantial experience I recommend following it up with the free album called “Deux Ex Machinae”.  This being their first quasi-professional album it stands as a homage to such gaming classics as the intro to Final Fantasy VI closed by the track Flagcarrier. If this still wasn’t enough head to ITunes, Google Play Music or to your preferred platform and blast the triumvirate of “Redeemer”-”Overworld”-”A view from” all day long!

THE ORGANISER
Improving gaming communities with fun
The main goal of Insert Coin Association for Video Game Culture (founded in 2013) is to improve the local gaming community. http://insert-coin.hu/ (non-profit organisation)
PixelCon is our video game cultural party brand.
PixelCon is not a commercial event selling the latest gamer stuff, nor a gaming history exhibition. PixelCon presents the real values of gaming culture, the fun experience. Not only by showcasing these video games but with fostering any creative manifestation that has roots in it: like video game music.
This is why the live music acts are among the most important parts of PixelCon parties. Loud video game music blows your mind!

The most expensive part
Previously 75% of the PixelCon parties' budget has been used for the concerts.
Some said this is unfair against those who don't want to stay until the concert and don't want to pay the full price PixelCon ticket.
On the other hand, if the budget is bigger the financial risk is higher.
For the next PixelCon we've invited the famous Swedish band MACHINAE SUPREMACY. Following the will of the Insert Coin Association members, we have to handle the financial risks by raising the money for this show via crowdfunding.
If it succeeds, this show will blow your mind. But if it fails, we won't charge the backers and we have to give up on the MaSu concert.

<p>BOSTON
HASSLE is one of the three main components of the 501(c)(3) non-profit BRAIN Arts Organization. Our mission is:</p><p><i>Foster an innovative, compelling, and interconnected music, art, and film community in the greater Boston area through grassroots and inclusive participatory culture.</i></p><p>Boston Hassle is a <b>COMPLETELY VOLUNTEER-RUN</b> project that constantly interacts with, participates in, writes about, and generally shines a light on Boston and New England's art, music, and film communities! </p><p><b>
We cannot throw this festival without your support! </b>We are a group of individuals united by a love of art and infused with a DIY
spirit that guides us in making this and all of our other events
and projects happen. We serve the artistic
community of Boston and New England and we aim to show through this campaign that
our community believes in what we do.</p>
<p>By
supporting Boston Hassle and our biggest event of the year, Hassle Fest 6,
you can ensure that our organization and all of its artistic, community-minded
initiatives get the most exposure that they will receive all year. You'll also
be helping to guarantee that a seriously amazing and eye-opening music festival
has the support that it needs to be as wonderful and exciting as it possibly
can be!<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>
</span></p><p><b><span></span></b></p><h3><b>What We Are Asking For</b></h3><p></p>
<p>We
are trying to raise $6,500 via this campaign. After fees this will leave Boston
Hassle with roughly $6,000 if successful. This amount is roughly 1/3 of the overall cost of throwing Hassle Fest 6. Funding
for the rest of the fest and its many costs* will come from ticket sales and
various fest sponsorships. This
Indiegogo campaign must succeed for the fest to go on as planned!<br/><br/>
*Most of the costs for Hassle Fest are performer related, but there are other
costs as well including: Venue fees, printing, and art. Hassle Fest will
cost about $17,500 to put on. No individual in our organization receives any compensation for their effort in producing this festival.</p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why Support This Campaign (and Boston Hassle)?</b><br/></p><p></p>
<p>This
is our 6th annual Boston Hassle Fest. This year also marks our 4th crowd-sourced
fundraising effort on behalf of Hassle Fest. In each previous year we have
achieved our goal and each and every year the fest,

your commitment to our core principle of offering affordable, all-ages shows featuring
engaging musical artists that are fairly compensated.</span></p>
<p>Together
with your support, we will not only succeed in throwing an incredible festival but more importantly we will demonstrate to Boston and the wider public that
there is <b>a viable alternative, non-profit model for supporting
music and the arts</b>, one that avoids the pitfalls of alcohol-driven profits and ""safe,"" industry-sponsored musical acts. As our message travels farther and
reaches more ears we will hopefully have more opportunities to initiate and
support even more art-focused and community-minded projects.<br/></p>

HASSLE MUSIC FESTIVAL. We are Boston's Underground Music Fest!BRAIN Arts Organization is proud to present the 6th Annual Boston Hassle Fest! This year's festival will be held on November 7 and 8 at Cuisine en Locale in Somerville, MA and is bigger and better than ever with 40+ bands over two days (scroll to bottom for full lineup and event details) and featured headliners:

Body/Head (Kim Gordon (of Sonic Youth) and Bill Nace)
Chris Corsano and Bill Orcutt duo
No Joy
Jason Lescalleet and Kevin Drumm duo
Nautical Almanac

Bill Orcutt (solo)

Blues Control



BOSTON
HASSLE is one of the three main components of the 501(c)(3) non-profit BRAIN Arts Organization. Our mission is:Foster an innovative, compelling, and interconnected music, art, and film community in the greater Boston area through grassroots and inclusive participatory culture.Boston Hassle is a COMPLETELY VOLUNTEER-RUN project that constantly interacts with, participates in, writes about, and generally shines a light on Boston and New England's art, music, and film communities! 
We cannot throw this festival without your support! We are a group of individuals united by a love of art and infused with a DIY
spirit that guides us in making this and all of our other events
and projects happen. We serve the artistic
community of Boston and New England and we aim to show through this campaign that
our community believes in what we do.
By
supporting Boston Hassle and our biggest event of the year, Hassle Fest 6,
you can ensure that our organization and all of its artistic, community-minded
initiatives get the most exposure that they will receive all year. You'll also
be helping to guarantee that a seriously amazing and eye-opening music festival
has the support that it needs to be as wonderful and exciting as it possibly
can be!


What We Are Asking For
We
are trying to raise $6,500 via this campaign. After fees this will leave Boston
Hassle with roughly $6,000 if successful. This amount is roughly 1/3 of the overall cost of throwing Hassle Fest 6. Funding
for the rest of the fest and its many costs* will come from ticket sales and
various fest sponsorships. This
Indiegogo campaign must succeed for the fest to go on as planned!
*Most of the costs for Hassle Fest are performer related, but there are other
costs as well including: Venue fees, printing, and art. Hassle Fest will
cost about $17,500 to put on. No individual in our organization receives any compensation for their effort in producing this festival.Why Support This Campaign (and Boston Hassle)?
This
is our 6th annual Boston Hassle Fest. This year also marks our 4th crowd-sourced
fundraising effort on behalf of Hassle Fest. In each previous year we have
achieved our goal and each and every year the fest,
and with it our organization, has grown substantially.By
contributing to this campaign and sharing it with others YOU show
your commitment to our core principle of offering affordable, all-ages shows featuring
engaging musical artists that are fairly compensated.
Together
with your support, we will not only succeed in throwing an incredible festival but more importantly we will demonstrate to Boston and the wider public that
there is a viable alternative, non-profit model for supporting
music and the arts, one that avoids the pitfalls of alcohol-driven profits and ""safe,"" industry-sponsored musical acts. As our message travels farther and
reaches more ears we will hopefully have more opportunities to initiate and
support even more art-focused and community-minded projects.
Lend a Hand!
Please
share our campaign and our campaign video! We are into embeds and shares but
we are also into word of mouth! People used to do that before the internet! Remember that?!
The Boston Hassle webzine and the Boston Compass newspaper exist as platforms for artists,
writers, video makers, and designers (from New England and beyond) to showcase
their art. Use us as a platform, enrich what we do, and get your
work seen or heard by our huge worldwide readership and viewership.
WE ALSO NEED AWESOME PEOPLE (like
you!) TO VOLUNTEER WITH BOSTON HASSLE. Please get in touch about show listings, writing for the paper or website, taking photos, site/calendar maintenance, videography, organizational
help, social networking, Compass distribution, or ANY OTHER NEW IDEAS you may
have for what this organization could be. We are open to new ideas, in fact, WE
LOVE THEM. If what you’re into is not represented in our pages or on our site but you think it should be, TAKE INITIATIVE AND BECOME A PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING! Get in touch at bostonhassle@gmail.com or take a look at one of these sites:
www.bostonhassle.comwww.bostonhassle.com/boston-compasswww.bostonhassle.com/hassleshowswww.bostonhasslefest.comStretch GoalsReach for the sky! If you help us get beyond our goal of $6,500 you can support Boston Hassle in the following ways:

$7,500: We will purchase a new subwoofer so that we can bring in the best electronic music performers from around the world for your enjoyment.

$9,000: We will purchase a new PA system so that we can put on EVEN MORE than the 100+ shows we already do per year. And with a new PA each and every one of those shows will sound better and LOUDER than they already do.

$12,000: Boston Hassle will give back to you with a FREE SHOW HEADLINED BY LIGHTNING BOLT. Seriously.

Thanks again for stopping by our crowdfunding page! We hope you'll support us, either with a donation or with your time. A special thanks goes to Marina Argyriou, Stephen Hill, Sydney Kinchen, Matt Lundin, James Moore, and Véra Vidal for the excellent campaign video above! Party on dudes, and we'll see you in November!

Fans of the arts are the only reason the music industry exists in the first place, so without you we would be nothing. I'd also like to thank J for her passion and willingness to accomplish her dreams, regardless of what ""Labels"" told her because without that we would have never met to take this idea to the next level. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Thank you for the introduction J. As she said in the Video, I'm Chad, an entrepreneur and long time problem solver (or at least that's what I'm told). I've consulted with numerous start ups and business owners, and when I decided to take my skills online I met J. I'll always remember the first Skype we had because as I do with all of my clients, I asked the question: ""Why are you doing this?"" She responded by saying, ""because I want to touch peoples hearts and make them happy."" By this time I had already watched a few of her videos, and even though I couldn't understand what she was saying through much of the songs (English is my only fluent language), I couldn't stop listening because that's exactly what her music did; these feelings are exactly what led me to my second set of questions: ""Why can't you do this for a living? Haven't you contacted labels, tried producing records, etc.?"" and her response is what has inspired this journey I'm on with her. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When J told me she had performed at numerous shows, contacted multiple record labels, spoke with producers, and collaborated with other industry artists and still had to work a day job because she didn't fit the ""image"" necessary to be a part of ""their industry"" I was more than upset. As a passionate lover of music, I've never believed that a person had to fit a specific ""image"" to perform well. Music is about creating beauty out of sound and passion, not magazine covers and photo shoots. So the beauty I found in her inspired me to solve this problem. This campaign is not only the launchpad for J's career, but also the launch to a business system I have specially designed that makes the only things necessary to be a professional performing artist are passion and fans. </span><br/></p>
<p>By backing this campaign you are helping launch a talented young artist's first album, while also helping take an industry back and give it to the fans and artists who created it. When other up and coming or ostracized artists see the success created here, they will know that they can mimic this system to make a living performing full time without being under the thumb of a label.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3> <p>First and foremost, we need your attention. We need you to share this campaign as often as possible with as many people as possible. Without awareness, there can be no change, and your willingness to share is what will create the awareness we need to succeed. </p>
<p>Second, we need you to give whatever you can spare for the cause. Even a dollar gets us closer to showing industry labels that the revolution has begun. The following is a cost chart for producing the album and other perks we've added for this remarkable occasion.</p>

<li>While composing new music for my second album, I'm being hampered by the fact that my current harp, a beautiful but aging, third-hand instrument, is having a variety of technical problems.  It is also quite large and cumbersome, and a more portable instrument would greatly enhance and expand my music-sharing opportunities.    </li>
<li>WIth your kind and generous help, a new harp will allow me to continue performing to support my first album, and give me what I need to continue composing for my second and beyond, G-d willing!  I seek a new, high-quality instrument that will last many years of inspired song-making.  I am happy to say that when people come to my concerts, it makes a real positive difference in their lives.  I think this music of harp and voice gives people a rare, precious moment to connect to the soul within. </li>
<li> Please help me continue to give the gift of inspirational Music to many more people!</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>A high quality, long-lasting new harp is not so cheap!  34 strings are a lot more than the six on a standard guitar.  I'm hoping to purchase a new, high-quality, portable, 34-string harp from a reputable harp maker, and I've done a lot of research on what that constitutes.  (I'm looking mostly at Dusty Strings and Thormahlen, as well as Blevins).</li>
<li>If I don't reach the entire goal, I will use whatever money is made towards a harp anyhow, and I may have to purchase a less costly model or a used model.  Whatever you contribute is significant to me and will help-thank you so much!!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>This music business is not what one would call financially lucrative!  But for years I have sweated, learning how to use my head, heart, voice, and hands to coax the music from my harp and soul.   Raising my beautiful family and making time for music has been a solid challenge, but I must press on because I feel fundamentally that this is what G-d wants from me.  And little in this whole world makes me feel more alive than when someone says, ""This music is so deep.""  That means it touched them, and in today's world I can think of little that is more truly valuable.      </li>

Hi!  My name is Rachael Rosenbaum.  Thanks so much for reading.  I sing and play the lever harp (and other unique instruments), and make music in hopes of uplifting and deepening the lives of fellow women.  The harp, rather than the guitar or piano, is the instrument which, for some reason, my hands and voice feel most comfortable with!  (See www.harprachael.com for more information.)  
While composing new music for my second album, I'm being hampered by the fact that my current harp, a beautiful but aging, third-hand instrument, is having a variety of technical problems.  It is also quite large and cumbersome, and a more portable instrument would greatly enhance and expand my music-sharing opportunities.    
WIth your kind and generous help, a new harp will allow me to continue performing to support my first album, and give me what I need to continue composing for my second and beyond, G-d willing!  I seek a new, high-quality instrument that will last many years of inspired song-making.  I am happy to say that when people come to my concerts, it makes a real positive difference in their lives.  I think this music of harp and voice gives people a rare, precious moment to connect to the soul within.

What We Need & What You Get
A high quality, long-lasting new harp is not so cheap!  34 strings are a lot more than the six on a standard guitar.  I'm hoping to purchase a new, high-quality, portable, 34-string harp from a reputable harp maker, and I've done a lot of research on what that constitutes.  (I'm looking mostly at Dusty Strings and Thormahlen, as well as Blevins).

 l'album - pendant une formation de Yoga que j'enseigne. <br/></p><p>""My Man"" est la toute ma première chanson que j'ai composé. J'écrivais en anglais, Marianne est franco-américaine, nous avions toutes les deux sortie notre premier album en 2008 sans le savoir. Cette 
collaboration s'est imposée tout naturellement, et le choix du compositeur 
Naïm Amor s'est fait dans la continuité. <br/></p><p>Dès la première chanson ça 
marchait et on a fait 11 titres ! </p><p>Le choix du guitariste Yan Péchin sonnait aussi comme une évidence parce qu'il est dans la rupture, les contrastes, la dissonance, ce qui collait parfaitement avec la couleur recherchée pour l'album.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Toute l'équipe !<br/>

Man"", is comprised of 11 tracks written by Vanessa in French and English
 and composed by Naïm Amor, with producer Marianne Dissard.

Nouvel album My ManSans chercher à refaire du Velvet Underground mais fortement inspirée 
par leur liberté de faire et par leur son, pour ce
 nouvel album, je me suis entourée d'artistes franco-américains dont Marianne
 Dissard à la réalisation et le multi-instrumentiste Naïm Amor à la 
composition.L'album contient 11 titres dont une reprise des Velvets 
Underground ""After Hours"". Auteure des textes, j'ai aussi co-composé 4 titres, dont ""My Man"". Il vient d'être enregistré à Paris, au 
studio Haxo, avec Yan Péchin à la guitare (guitariste d'Alain Bashung, 
Brigitte Fontaine, Miossec..), à la batterie Arthur Vint et à
 la basse Scott Colberg, venus tout droit de New York. © Murielle SauzotLa sortie de l'album est prévue 
pour le printemps 2015. Mais pour le finaliser je dois encore prévoir pas 
mal de choses dont le mixage à Minneapolis, au fabuleux studio Hideaway fondé par Joe Mabbott, et le master avec Loud 
mastering. Il restera également les droits SDRM et le pressage de 
l'album à financer.Ce troisième album est très important pour moi, parce que j'ai pris les 
choses en main dès le début pour la première fois, dans le choix et la 
structure des textes à mettre en musique, des mélodies et des 
compositions, afin de faire des chansons qui me correspondent vraiment. 
C'est tout cela que j'aimerai partager avec vous...Parution dans le Journal La Marseillaise19-06-2014L'enregistrement au studio Haxo à Paris
A quoi servira le financement ?L'enregistrement est fait, le shooting et la pochette de l'album aussi. Pour finir 
et sortir cet album comme prévu, il manque encore quelques étapes : le mixage, le mastering, le règlement des droits SDRM de la Sacem, et le pressage des albums. Si
 je n'atteins pas la somme espérée, la priorité sera le mixage à 
Minneapolis. Le mixage à Minneapolis 
Mixer l'album à Minneapolis est vraiment dans la continuité du projet, pour la couleur franco-américaine de l'album... The
 Hideaway Studio of Minneapolis, founded by Joseph Mabbot, MN, is a premier music recording facility 
serving the Minneapolis, MN market and such artists as Snoop Dogg, 
Justin Bieber, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, Cloud Cult, The Matches, Marianne Dissard, and 
Doomtree...La petite histoire...
Alors que je 
travaillais depuis quelques mois à l'écriture de mes nouvelles chansons, j'ai rencontré Marianne Dissard - qui réalise
 l'album - pendant une formation de Yoga que j'enseigne. ""My Man"" est la toute ma première chanson que j'ai composé. J'écrivais en anglais, Marianne est franco-américaine, nous avions toutes les deux sortie notre premier album en 2008 sans le savoir. Cette 
collaboration s'est imposée tout naturellement, et le choix du compositeur 
Naïm Amor s'est fait dans la continuité. Dès la première chanson ça 
marchait et on a fait 11 titres ! Le choix du guitariste Yan Péchin sonnait aussi comme une évidence parce qu'il est dans la rupture, les contrastes, la dissonance, ce qui collait parfaitement avec la couleur recherchée pour l'album.Toute l'équipe !
 Marianne DissardElle est franco-américaine, parolière et réalisatrice. 
Auteure-interprète de 3 albums, elle a collaboré avec Naïm Amor, 
Calexico, Howe Gelb, Sergio Mendoza, Fredda… Elle a réalisé elle-même 
ses 2 derniers 
albums, et celui de Orso Jesenska. Naïm AmorIl est franco-américain. Auteur compositeur et multi-instrumentiste, il a écrit et composé plusieurs albums (Dansons, La sanguine…) et collaboré à divers projets également, dont le premier album de Marianne Dissard. Yan Péchin Il est français, guitariste et compositeur. Il a collaboré en studio et sur scène avec plusieurs artistes comme Alain Bashung, Brigitte Fontaine, Chloé Mons, Miossec...Vanessa Philippe Elle est française, auteure-interprète de 2 premiers album sortis en 2008 (La dérive) et en 2011 (La fille sans qualités). Elle commence à composer pour ce troisième album. Elle est aussi danseuse contemporaine et chorégraphe pour la pièce ""Tenez votre droite"".Last words
L'album n'attend plus que d'être mixé et masterisé pour sortir enfin. C'est l'affaire de quelques semaines, avant de pouvoir l'écouter chez vous :)Le clip du premier single sortira dès la rentrée 2014 ! And don't forget...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello folks - so happy to have you here!</p>

Hello folks - so happy to have you here!
I'm a singer/songwriter from Newfoundland, Canada.  I've spent the last few years in Seoul, South Korea and I've managed to record my second album there.
This time, I've had the pleasure of visiting a real studio with an amazingly talented producer/engineer.


What I Need & What You Get
All of the tracks have been recorded and I've already paid that process.
All that's left is to have the album edited, mixed and mastered.  
I'm not looking to make any money from this. I just want to be able to release it!
Essentially this campaign is a pre-ordering of the album.  
You pre-buy the album at a discounted price, I then have enough to have it finished, and ultimately you get the digital download of the album when it's ready!


Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't want to pre-buy the album, any amount helps!
Also, helping spread the word goes a long way. :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We wake up early.</h3>
<p>First and foremostly, thanks for stopping by and checking us out.  We are The 8:30 Band*, a 5-piece band from Glen Burnie, MD.  We're either a Rock band that plays Worship music, or a Worship band that plays our music in ways that could be classified as ""Rock"". We're not sure how to classify it except to say that we love Jesus a ridiculous amount and we tell Him that in energetically loud ways.  Sometimes quieter ways...but mostly loud-ish to loud ways.  We've been together for almost 10 years (October 1st is our Band-iversary, if sincerity and precision is your thing) leading worship at Faith Baptist Church.</p>
<p>(*We lead the 8;30 worship at Faith.  That's how we got such a creative name.  There's nothing more to it than that.  We told you we wake up early.)</p>
<p>After almost 10 years together (again, October 1st...but you understand), we decided it was time to record an album like real bands do.  We kicked around a lot of different ideas, looked at where most of our attention has been regarding writing and arranging worship music - and we discovered where so much of our attention has been spent over the years.</p>
<h3>We wake up early...for Christmas.</h3>
<p>We love Christmas.  We love music.  We REALLY love Christmas music.</p>
<p>We realized that, as the self-proclaimed ""Most Christmasy Band Ever"", we've put so much time and creative energy into putting together our own Christmas songs and versions of popular Christmas carols for our ""Christmas with The 8:30 Band"" Christmas shows, it only makes sense that our first album EVER should be of the festive variety.  Our problem then became, ""How do we pick which songs to include?""  With all of the Christmas shows and worship concerts we've done, we had so many tunes to pull from and we love them all.  Do we include one of our 15-minute medleys? Is the world asking for a country/funk/blues/gospel/operatic version of ""Jingle Bells""? Should we include ""Dominck the Donkey"" and pay massive royalties for that ridiculous song</p>
<p>No.  No to all of that.  </p>
<p>Then we asked ourselves, ""The 8:30 Band...what are you really about?"" The answer gave us our direction.</p>
<h3>We wake up early...for the true meaning of Christmas.</h3>
<p>We're here to point to Jesus Christ. If this is the only album we ever put together (we hope not...but at this rate...let's be honest) the one thing we want to communicate is the joy we have because of Jesus Christ.  Without realizing it, the songs that we have written and arranged over the years have had the theme of ""Joy"" running through all of them. </p>
<p>Joy because of hope made possible.</p>
<p>Joy because of rescue made a reality.</p>
<p>Joy because the Creator of the universe, in love and mercy, stepped down from His throne in Heaven to enter into our mess and provide a way out for us.  There is nothing greater, nothing more deserving of praise, than this. This calls for a really loud-ish to loud celebration.</p>
<p>Dominick the Donkey will just have to wait.</p>
<h3>Exceeding Great Joy.</h3>
<p>Our album is all about communicating this joy, celebrating Jesus Christ coming into our world and giving everything we have to Him in worship.  In Matthew 2:10, we're told that when the wise men saw the star, they ""rejoiced with exceeding great joy"".  On this side of the manger - on this side of the cross - that realization is even greater for us.  So, we choose to look at the word ""exceeding"" not as an adjective, but a verb.  There's joy.  There's GREAT joy.  But because of Jesus, we're going beyond that.  We're EXCEEDING great joy (see what we did there? Our next album will be called, ""Play on Words"").</p>
<p>So, here we are.  We've been hard at work in the studio with Greg Parker of Amped Recording, and we are SO excited about what's being put together.  We're working on a 10 song album called ""Exceeding Great Joy"".  We're about halfway finished and have the end in sight!</p>
<h3>But...</h3>
<p>We need your help to finish the album.  </p>
<p>We've put out all of our resources and have come to the point where we need you to come alongside us and be a part of this project so that we can complete the album the way we are hoping. In order to finish the full project, we need to raise another $5,000.</p>
<p>This will allow us to complete the recording process, as well as have the full album mixed and mastered.  This will also allow us to put together a full, professionally designed CD package for your festive enjoyment (you may also enjoy the album during non-festive times.  We certainly would never discourage that.)</p>
<p>We are asking you to prayerfully consider being a part of this process by helping us raise the funds to put this whole thing together.  Even if we don't raise all of the money, we will put together and package whatever we can based on what God provides.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">We want you to wake up early, too.</span></strong></p>
<p>When we say things like, ""We want you to come alongside us"", or, ""We want you to be a part of this""...this is totally true, not just some hip-sounding verbage to try and ask for money without you realizing it.  We really do want you to be a part of this.  Like, be a part of the whole thing.</p>
<p>This is not our day job.  We aren't relying on this campaign/this album to help feed our families.  We just love Jesus, we love this music and we want to put together the best album we can.  The band members won't take one red cent (or any other color cents, for that matter) from your donations and any money made from album sales goes right into a fund for a future album.  This means...all we need is to fund the album, and that's given us the freedom to offer some creative ""perks"" to make you feel like you're a part of this whole experience.</p>
<p>At every level of donation, you'll get some kind of merchandise (none of these ""virtual high-fives"". Though, we will give those out for free if you really, really want that. (There.  Just did it.) With each donation, you will also receive all the perks that are offered at the other levels before it.</p>
<p>AND because of our partnership with Faith Baptist Church, your donations are TAX-DEDUCTIBLE (check each perk on the right to see how much is deductible)!</p>
<p>Everyone who contributes $8 (they wouldn't let us do $8.30.  We really wanted to.  We thought it was so clever) will get a digital download of the full album as soon as it's available.  We're also offering the full album, a signed drumstick, an 8:30 guitar pick and an 8:30 sticker all at various levels of donation.</p>
<p>We're really excited about the perks offered at the $60 donation level.  At this level, you and your family will be invited to be a part of the first 8:30 Band Christmas Extravaganza (that's a fancy word for ""party""/""get-together""), complete with tacky sweaters, Christmas carol singing with The 8:30 Band and so much more.  Also, at this level of donation, you'll get an extremely rare, CHRISTMAS edition of the original fan-design ""I Wake Up Early"" t-shirt.  These shirts will also be individually numbered to prove to the world that your shirt is remarkably special (and people will say, ""8:30 Who?"").</p>
<p>BUT what we're REALLY fired up about is the chance for you to LITERALLY be a part of this album. At the $100 level, you will be invited to come sing group vocals on one of the songs on the album, as well as have your name printed in the liner notes (as well as receiving ALL of the other perks offered at the previous levels).</p>
<p>The experiences don't end there.  At $500, you will become a vital part of The 8:30 Band's Christmas show experience.  You'll get the VIP treatment as well as come ON STAGE with us to perform ""Little Drummer Boy"".  We will teach and rehearse the song with you and you will be a part of 8:30 history. </p>
<p>At the $1,000, get yourself some business cards printed up because you, my friend, will be a PRODUCER of the album, and will receive credit as such in the liner notes.  We will also come to your house (in the Baltimore-metro area) or whatever space has an outlet, and we will perform an acoustic Christmas/Worship set for you and anyone else you'd like to include!</p>
<p>For $1,830 (see, we'd work that '8:30' in some way!) you will get all of the merchandise and experiences, PLUS an autographed guitar used to record the album, as well as a very special ""Thank you"" in the liner notes of our album. (And it will be verbose and well-written!)</p>
<p>Finally, if you fund the whole project, you will get everything previously offered...and only one other thing.  You get to cut Jeff's mohawk off onstage at one of the Christmas shows.  Jeff feels confident that his 'hawk is safe, but many are holding out hope that it doesn't make it to New Years.  Primarily, Jeff's wife...HELP HER OUT!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We wake up early...to thank you.</h3>
<p>So many of you have supported us over the years, and it is impossible to express how grateful we are for each of you.  We want to put something together that will enhance your Christmas celebration and bring honor to Jesus. We are so appreciative to all of you for helping to make this possible.</p>
<p>Even if you can't help financially - and we TOTALLY understand that - please consider praying for us and help us get the word out!</p>
<p>Thanks again - and Merry Christmas!</p>
</div>

The experiences don't end there.  At $500, you will become a vital part of The 8:30 Band's Christmas show experience.  You'll get the VIP treatment as well as come ON STAGE with us to perform ""Little Drummer Boy"".  We will teach and rehearse the song with you and you will be a part of 8:30 history. 
At the $1,000, get yourself some business cards printed up because you, my friend, will be a PRODUCER of the album, and will receive credit as such in the liner notes.  We will also come to your house (in the Baltimore-metro area) or whatever space has an outlet, and we will perform an acoustic Christmas/Worship set for you and anyone else you'd like to include!
For $1,830 (see, we'd work that '8:30' in some way!) you will get all of the merchandise and experiences, PLUS an autographed guitar used to record the album, as well as a very special ""Thank you"" in the liner notes of our album. (And it will be verbose and well-written!)
Finally, if you fund the whole project, you will get everything previously offered...and only one other thing.  You get to cut Jeff's mohawk off onstage at one of the Christmas shows.  Jeff feels confident that his 'hawk is safe, but many are holding out hope that it doesn't make it to New Years.  Primarily, Jeff's wife...HELP HER OUT!


We wake up early...to thank you.
So many of you have supported us over the years, and it is impossible to express how grateful we are for each of you.  We want to put something together that will enhance your Christmas celebration and bring honor to Jesus. We are so appreciative to all of you for helping to make this possible.
Even if you can't help financially - and we TOTALLY understand that - please consider praying for us and help us get the word out!
Thanks again - and Merry Christmas!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My associate Alex is also a graduate with a bachelor’s in Music Management. We both have had our own established bands that have served Pacific on numerous occasions. My band, Sugar Water Purple, performed at last year’s TEDx event, and Alex’s band, Tipping Point has also played for countless Pacific events such as profile day, preview day, and ASUOP events. I am the assistant director at a family owned nonprofit music school run by my parents called the Zion Academy of Music here in Stockton.</p>
<p>            On Friday, April the 12<sup>th</sup> at Weber Point, I am, with the support of the Zion Academy of Music, putting on a concert for the city of Stockton called <em>the Reclaim Concert – Something Beautiful for the City</em>. <em>Reclaim </em>will include a band along with an orchestra and guest singers. The band will consist of keyboards, organ, bass, guitars, drums, brass, and a 30 piece orchestra, which will consist of strings, woodwinds, and other brass. All this will be happening at the Reclaim Concert and it will all be free for the public. No admission charge at all.</p>
<p>            The purpose of the concert is to counteract the doubt and hopelessness and show the beauty that is in Stockton. This is our mission statement:</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><em>“The Reclaim Concert is an artistic effort to serve as a catalyst to the ongoing positive message that there is still hope in Stockton, and to regain ownership of our city. We reject any and all forms of apathy toward Stockton, and we strive to bring out the beauty that already exists within her.”</em></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>            We seek to use our artistic gifts and talents to partner with the positive movements that already exist in Stockton; great movements like <em>Serve Our Stockton</em>, <em>the</em> <em>Summer Success Leadership Academy</em>, and <em>the</em> <em>Beyond Our Gates Initiative</em>. <em>Reclaim</em> will be a beautiful evening of live original music, poetry, and more; all of it dedicated to the city. The concert itself will be professional both musically and aesthetically with expert sound engineers and lighting, and it will all be free for the public.</p>
<p>            One of our short-term goals is to draw in Stockton natives, and spectators and to make a positive spectacle of downtown. Our long-term goal is to make this concert a regular occurring event that the city becomes known for. We wish to assist the city in making itself more attractive to business owners looking for cities to plant their businesses. Furthermore, through this concert, we seek to change the mindset of those who would otherwise have a very apathetic view of Stockton. We believe and maintain that music is a very powerful inspirational tool that can change hearts and attitudes; and once the mindset is changed, actions will follow. Lastly, we seek to make this something that can be easily replicated so that we may be able to travel to other cities like Stockton with the same purpose and vision, working with the officials, community leaders, and orchestra within those cities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            In order to make <em>Reclaim </em>a success, we need one key and crucial thing, and that is financial Support. Of course, anything of this caliber needs money. We have all of our musicians, singers, and engineers in place, a lot of which have agreed to donate their talents for free. That cuts down a lot of the cost, but nevertheless, there are still a lot of expenses that we need money for such as sound equipment, lighting, the renting of the space, electricity, and the payment of guests singers; one of whom is Joanna Borromeo, a very well known Canadian RnB singer, songwriter, and keyboardist. According to our budget, we need to raise $15,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>            Would you consider partnering with us and donating money to this cause? We have garnered support from amazing people such as President Pamela Eibeck of the University of the Pacific, who has said that she “will match up to $5,000 gifts, including in-kind, from the city, private businesses and donors.” So if there is anything that you can contribute to this lofty endeavor, it would mean a lot for this project and this city. </h3></div>","My name is Joshua Washington; I am a recent graduate of the University of the Pacific with a bachelor’s degree in Music Composition.

<p>It's time to make my next album... so let's do something
different, shall we?!</p>
<p>In the past two years my expression of life, music and
songwriting has evolved into a much more fluid notion.  It seemed, only
natural then to also make this next album in this new way of Being.  </p><p>Here some sound bytes to listen to: </p><p><b><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/02-fill-you-up-mp3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/02-fill-you-up-mp3</a></b><br/></p><p><b><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/08-nothing-could-be-better"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/08-nothing-could-be-better</a></b><br/></p><p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/one-my-love"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/one-my-love</b></a><br/></p>
<p>I have asked 2 special artists,  people I really
admire, who inspire me &amp; have great enthusiasm for life (they are The
Magnificent), to bring their creative elements to this Liquid Love Journey.
 </p>
<p>My path within and to places both near and far, has painted
a swirling idea into being and together with The Magnificent we get to
create a wonderful product that will encapsulate all the love and passion we
all have for our individual art and craft.  I treasure having found
like-minded souls in a place where only soul &amp; art exists.</p>
<p>You are a huge part of this creative process as every single
contribution you make here will create a more relaxed and inspired space for
this Creation to come into being.  Art is nothing if not shared, whatever
your opinion - All remains valid.</p>
<p>Amazing poet, Luzaan Ackermann and songwriter, photographer
supreme Andy Lund make up The Magnificent team.  ""Liquid Love""
will have exquisite quality of songs and music, with the most exciting part
being - the passionate, creative additions added to the album by these
inspirational souls. For this I need your assistance and contributions to make
the art count in beautiful colour - be it film, photos, graphics, music, studio
performances and poetry.</p>
<h3><b>What the funds raised will be used for &amp; what you can
receive for your gracious involvement.</b></h3>
<p>Making an album is a wonderful intricate process and
involves devoted time and energy to tell a story in sound!  The funds
raised during this campaign will go towards
recording/mixing/mastering/producing as well as fees for musicians &amp; the
distribution and marketing of the album (which include photos, video &amp;
promotion).</p>
<p>We have some awesome perks available to choose from
(including advance copies of the new album, attending a recording session and
many more!)</p>
<p>The first 50 people that contribute to the campaign will
receive a (download) copy of Skye's first album ""Transformme"" over
and above the normal perks.</p>
<h3><b>We all do it together</b></h3>
<p>I am overwhelmed and so appreciative of the incredible
support and love I receive at my gigs.  It is an inspiring and phenomenal
space to create and experience with you all.</p>
<p>We get to create this album in a similar way, where you
contribute in advance and the Magnificent and I do the work and put the package
together! Awesome!</p>
<h3><b>Challenges</b></h3>
<p>Having always worked on a tight budget with original
recordings, trimming down our  working environment and being more prepared
when heading into the studio are things well known to me.  The challenge
is to aim high and believe!</p>

In the past two years my expression of life, music and
songwriting has evolved into a much more fluid notion.  It seemed, only
natural then to also make this next album in this new way of Being.  Here some sound bytes to listen to: https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/02-fill-you-up-mp3https://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/08-nothing-could-be-betterhttps://soundcloud.com/1skyewilson/one-my-love
I have asked 2 special artists,  people I really
admire, who inspire me & have great enthusiasm for life (they are The
Magnificent), to bring their creative elements to this Liquid Love Journey.
 
My path within and to places both near and far, has painted
a swirling idea into being and together with The Magnificent we get to
create a wonderful product that will encapsulate all the love and passion we
all have for our individual art and craft.  I treasure having found
like-minded souls in a place where only soul & art exists.
You are a huge part of this creative process as every single
contribution you make here will create a more relaxed and inspired space for
this Creation to come into being.  Art is nothing if not shared, whatever
your opinion - All remains valid.
Amazing poet, Luzaan Ackermann and songwriter, photographer
supreme Andy Lund make up The Magnificent team.  ""Liquid Love""
will have exquisite quality of songs and music, with the most exciting part
being - the passionate, creative additions added to the album by these
inspirational souls. For this I need your assistance and contributions to make
the art count in beautiful colour - be it film, photos, graphics, music, studio
performances and poetry.
What the funds raised will be used for & what you can
receive for your gracious involvement.
Making an album is a wonderful intricate process and
involves devoted time and energy to tell a story in sound!  The funds
raised during this campaign will go towards
recording/mixing/mastering/producing as well as fees for musicians & the
distribution and marketing of the album (which include photos, video &
promotion).
We have some awesome perks available to choose from
(including advance copies of the new album, attending a recording session and
many more!)
The first 50 people that contribute to the campaign will
receive a (download) copy of Skye's first album ""Transformme"" over
and above the normal perks.
We all do it together
I am overwhelmed and so appreciative of the incredible
support and love I receive at my gigs.  It is an inspiring and phenomenal
space to create and experience with you all.
We get to create this album in a similar way, where you
contribute in advance and the Magnificent and I do the work and put the package
together! Awesome!
Challenges
Having always worked on a tight budget with original
recordings, trimming down our  working environment and being more prepared
when heading into the studio are things well known to me.  The challenge
is to aim high and believe!
I include here for those who wish to make a direct deposit
into my bank account the details: S. Wilson / First National Bank (FNB) / Branch code: 250655 / Account no:  62395219259  / FNB Swift code:  FIRNZAJJPlease include your email address as the reference so we may
contact and thank you.
Do you share this vision
with me? Some more ways in which you can help!
Your help in sharing the word about my campaign will be
invaluable.  Thank you in advance for letting your friends &
like-hearted community know about it.
Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word by
email, Twitter, Facebook and more!  Thank you for your loving support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>Hi, I'm Blake. <br/><br/>The Passing Clouds are basically myself and a loose collective of friends I get the pleasure to jam, gig, &amp; otherwise collaborate with. <br/><br/>here's a link to our facebook: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/omg.passingclouds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/omg.passingclouds</a> ..also our myspace: <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/omg.passingclouds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.myspace.com/omg.passingclouds</a> ..they both have demo recordings of songs that will be on the album.<br/><br/>This will be my first professionally produced recording. There's been a lot of special energy gone into the making of this record.<br/><br/>The vibe was first captured in a log cabin in the woods where most of the initial writing and recording process was done. It was a very pivotal, transformational, &amp; cathartic process that developed my craft as a songwriter. The songs speak of my inspiration, inner reflection, struggles, &amp; hardships through a time of upheaval, transition, transformation, personal &amp; artistic experimentation &amp; development.    <br/><br/>Some of the amazing folks I jammed with in the making of this record include: Tea &amp; Pickles (pictured), Dan-o, Slippers, Radical Suggestions, Katie, Aaron, Greg, Micheal Waters, &amp; Migiz.   <br/><br/>It's produced by Doug ""Slippers"" Fury @ Fortissimo Sound in Vancouver who has worked with other such artists as Bif Naked, Pride Tiger, Scatterheart &amp; the Smears. <br/><br/>This record was made with myself on guitars, harmonica, drums, &amp; vocals, Tea on bass, &amp; Slippers doing producing.<br/><br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>The ""Long Road to Mend"" EP is a soul, funk, rock, record for anyone searching to find their voice.

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Brynn and Katelyn have been studying and performing music for all of their lives. They met nearly 6 years ago as students at Columbia College Chicago and began collaborating. Brynn, a talented songwriter, has recorded three EPs of her original songs which are <a href=""http://brynnmawr.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target="""" title="""">currently available online</a>: ""Parting"", ""The Words Left Unsaid"", &amp; ""Made From Scratch"". Brynn has played as a featured performer at Schuba's NY Songwriter's Circle, The Bluebird Cafe, &amp; Uncommon Ground. Katelyn is an accomplished cellist and singer-songwriter who has played at the Chicago Blues Festival, the Double Door, and Elbo Room among other legendary Chicago venues.

<p><em><strong>A little background....</strong></em></p>
<p>Have you looked in the mirror lately? Well, you look really great. Anyway, so have you heard about crowdfunding? To sum it up quickly, Crowdfunding is a fairly new grassroots platform to raise money for projects - businesses, art projects, inventions, charities - you name it. It's a pretty exciting new business model, because it puts the power in the peoples' hands -- before something even exists, you have the power to be part of it right from the ground up.</p>
<p>Now to me -- some of you have known me since I started playing music. You were there when I played my first show ever at the Freetimes cafe, when I played teen angst anthems, ""Dirty Man"" and ""Skinny's Out"" and maybe you put $5 in the jug. Hard to believe that was almost 8 years ago now...and you haven't aged a day! What's your secret? Or maybe you were at my show in Red Deer in 2006 (on my first tour), when I awkwardly signed my first autograph on my DIY release, ""Up to Here."" Or maybe you just stumbled upon this page or a friend sent you here -- in that case, it's very nice to meet you, and thanks for taking the time to get to know me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hey, thanks guys...</em> </strong></p>
<p>To those of you who have been there with me from the ground up, and those of you I've come across along the way, THANK YOU. Everytime you put money in the jug, the hat, the guitar case, everytime you bought a CD, T-shirt, Touque, Everytime you paid cover, requested a song on the radio, or watched a youtube video, you have helped me, and I really have come a long way.</p>
<p>As you're probably aware, there is no longer a ""make it or break it"" world for musicians, outside of the <em>X-Factor, Idols</em>, and TV talent shows. What there <em>is</em> are good people like yourselves; supporting in projects and people that you believe in. I come from a community of hard-working musicians who want to create great music and bring it to as many people as possible, in hopes that they find some joy in listening to it.</p>
<p>So, in essence, you, my good looking smart and lovely friends, are the new record label.</p>
<p>For the last few years I have been travelling across Canada and parts of the U.S. doing what I love to do - play music. For the last 4 tours however, I was still toting <em>Mayflower</em> as my latest album. Many of you have been asking when the new album is going to happen -- the time is now!</p>
<p><em><strong>The new album...</strong><br/></em></p>
<p><em>Fire Breathers</em> consists of 13 songs spun together by a spaghetti-western love story that follows three imperfect characters --<em> the outlaw, the lady, and the man who was too good</em> -- through the torments and the pleasures of the heart.</p>
<p>Featuring Luke Stackhouse on bass, Jay Swinnerton on guitar and Pat Phillips on drums, <em>Fire Breathers</em> picks up where <em>Mayflower</em> left off -- picking up the pace and the decibal level to make a roots-rock record that I know you will be proud of.</p>
<p>Your help making this record will mean I'm out on the road again sooner, with more songs to bring to you. It means that I can move forward with my career at a steady and healthy pace, taking it one step at a time, to the next level. Maybe even level 11 (any Spinal Tap fans out there?)</p>
<p>I'm more than ready to release a new album -- I have the momentum, the drive, the team and the community -- all I need is a new record to keep me on track.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to some savings and some personal donations already received, recording is already underway, and it sounds amazing! I'm so excited to get this project off the ground!</p>
<p>If we can raise <strong>$6000</strong> this means we can record everything we want to hear, at top quality, with great equipment and great people. The money goes to studio time, engineering, mixing, mastering and manufacturing. </p>
<p>Some recording is being done at<em> River 16 Studio in Oakville</em> - they have a big beautiful live room, as well as some wonderful equipment, and talented engineers.</p>
<p>The rest of the recording is being done at <em>Reguladora Studio in Toronto</em>. This is the studio of Steve DaSilva -- a very talented young engineer with a passion for making fantastic sounds. Reguladora's mission is to replicate the gear and sounds found at Abbey Road studios in London. We certainly aren't the only ones to see that Steve DaSilva is a rising talent in the music engineering world -- upon completion of <em>Fire Breathers</em>, Steve will be heading to France to study the art of mixing with Eddie Kramer (who has worked with the likes of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Curtis Mayfield, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and many more).</p>
<p>If we don't reach this goal, there will still be a record. We'll see where we can get with the help of our friends and do the best we can with what we've got. It just might take a little longer.</p>
<p>If we surpass our goal, then bells will ring and rainbows will appear, and we will be able to reach further into the vision of this record and push ourselves to new heights -- think horn sections and chamber chorus!</p>
<p>There are perks for getting involved from the ground up! Check out the different prizes and incentives (on the column to your right) you could get by helping us out. From merchandise to artwork, baked goods and quality time, we have just the prize for you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every little bit helps -- and what you're doing is helping to keep the indie music scene alive! I'm really excited about this album, and even more excited to think how many people will have been involved with it before it even goes to print.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you want to help but just can't swing the bucks, I understand. If you can help me get the word out by passing this around to your social networks, your efforts are a huge value to me and I appreciate it!</p>

<p>I ran an indiegogo campaign last year for my most recent album which was recorded in a hunting lodge, I was amazed and surprised about strangers and friends generosity. With that last campaign we ( a huge team of us) managed to pull off an impossible task and got the album out to radio within six weeks of finishing at the lodge. That album has spun the globe and has hit numerous charts in the roots and blues area and has even received some Country music plays. It has hit big on the Bluesville Siriusxm Radio Network remaining in the top ten for weeks, Hit #1 a few times on the Roots Music Report, #2 across Canada on Roots Charts and many more listings, rankings, reviews etc.</p>
<p>We have set up a campaign as we are excited to be working on another CD this coming summer. Past recordings have earned numerous awards.......</p>
<p>Accolades include:</p>
<p>· IMA Best Blues Song of the Year Voters Choice</p>
<p>· Blues411 Best International Blues Release</p>
<p>· Blues Female Vocalist of the Year at SevernFM (uk)</p>
<p>· Runner up for Best Acoustic Blues Album of the Year (GR)</p>
<p>· Nominee for Solo Album of the Year in Northern Ontario</p>
<p>reviews and more are on my website <a href=""http://www.sundaywilde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sundaywilde.com</a></p>
<p>This time around, instead of recording in a remote hunting lodge where we recorded live with limited overdubs, we are now heading to North Dakota to record 10 brand new songs and some favorite cover songs in a fully equipped state of the art studio.</p>
<p>We will be working with Untouchable Productions and Studios, in their brand new recording facilities. Though we intend to stay with the live performance during the recording process, the studio setting will allow more options with more complex overdubs allowing us to import horns, strings, backup vocals and percussion.</p>
<p>Untouchable Productions have a reputation in the blues scene in the US and have worked with Blues Music Awards nominee Nora Jean, Native American Music Award winning band BlueDog, and many others. Little Bobby, guitarist, engineer and producer, who operates Untouchable Productions will be working on the project with us.</p>
<p>We have set up a variety of perks so our supporters/fans can donate and help invest in the new project. When you contribute towards the project, you can help us out by pre-purchasing the new release amoungst many other perks listed at the side. The money we raise towards this new recording will be used for a variety of expenses associated with including: travel, musician fees, mastering, mixing, photography, pressing and promotion.</p>
<p>The estimated costs for a recording and the promotion of an album can run into thousands....</p>
<p>· $2,000 Travel</p>
<p>· $3,000 Musican fees</p>
<p>· $5,000 Engineer, Producer, Mixing Fees, mastering</p>
<p>· $2,000 Artwork, photography, pressing costs, online fees for digital distribution</p>
<p>· $5,000 - $8,000 for promotion and advertising</p>
<p>· TOTAL expenses will range between $16,000 - $20,000</p>
<p>But we are hoping to raise less than half of our expenses with this indiegogo campaign. 7,000</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few quotes from reviews from my last album....</strong></p>
<p><em>""We get to take a peek ‘down the alley’ and into the world of obsession and the total commitment that it takes to live and appreciate it. Shadows of Billie Holiday and the many other Blues Ladies stir to greet Ms. Wilde as she sings of having not eaten, or taken care of herself since she found this love. She is on a ‘Love Bender’.

<h2>THANK YOU!!!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm incredibly honored and totally blown away by your generosity. We've surpassed my goal in just three incredible days, and I'm ecstatic to get to call this instrument my own. I am so grateful to all of you and excited to share lots of new music with you!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point I've already gotten enough contributions to buy my violin, so I'll be using the surplus to outfit it with all the gear that will help me sound my best with my new Adam Ezra Group bandmates. These additional components are so important to have on the road, and until now I thought I wouldn't be able to afford them for a long time to come!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You are AMAZING!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I have all that I need now- thank you!!! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those of you who still want to contribute, I want to let you know that once I've purchased the gear that I need, I'll be paying forward your incredible generosity by donating the extra to a few organizations dedicated to providing music education to the ""voiceless."" </p>
<p>I promise to post info on the specifics as soon as I get off the road, but for tonight, it's late and I'll sign off-- with the utmost gratitude, joy, and thanks to each of you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Corinna</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>Hi! Corinna here. I'm a fiddler/violinist and a music teacher, and I'm incredibly lucky to get to do what I love for a living (well, almost a living anyway!) I've been playing violin for 20 years, and I hope to play for another 80!!</p>
<p>Last month while on tour with the Adam Ezra Group (<a href=""http://www.adamezra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.adamezra.com</a>) in Bloomington, Indiana, my beloved fiddle was stolen from backstage during a concert. That instrument had been with me since I was 14, through adventures and auditions, weddings and funerals, parties, performances, and practice sessions, and had been my voice ever since I knew I even had a voice. It was the only material possession I had really cared about, and suddenly it was gone. I was heartbroken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I filed a police report, called over 100 pawn shops and instrument dealers, kept a vigilant eye on eBay and craigslist, and blasted facebook with the information (which my friends shared more than 500 times!), and spent an embarrassing amount of time crying and worrying about the safety and well-being of my four-stringed friend. Fortunately, I had the help of some really generous folks, who spread the word, helped make calls, and even loaned me a violin to perform with while I searched. But unfortunately my own instrument has not been recovered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, I began the quest for a new violin which would give me back my voice and my career...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m thrilled to tell you now that I’ve found something I really love! This instrument, a 1933 John Aschower violin made in California, was tucked into a corner of my local violin shop and as soon as I started playing it, I felt like it had potential. The good people at Shar were kind enough to loan it to me, and every day that I’ve been playing it, I’ve loved it even more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It feels GREAT to get my voice back!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks to my parents’ good judgment getting my violin insured years ago, as well as the generosity of the good folks at Shar who are giving me a great deal, I’m not starting from scratch trying to fundraise for this instrument. But I do still have a ways to go—a little over 4 thousand dollars—which from the perspective of a traveling musician, is a LOT of money.</p>

<p>-Corinna</p></div>","dear friends,
THANK YOU!!!
 
I'm incredibly honored and totally blown away by your generosity. We've surpassed my goal in just three incredible days, and I'm ecstatic to get to call this instrument my own. I am so grateful to all of you and excited to share lots of new music with you!!
 
At this point I've already gotten enough contributions to buy my violin, so I'll be using the surplus to outfit it with all the gear that will help me sound my best with my new Adam Ezra Group bandmates. These additional components are so important to have on the road, and until now I thought I wouldn't be able to afford them for a long time to come!
 
You are AMAZING!!!
 
I have all that I need now- thank you!!! 
 
For those of you who still want to contribute, I want to let you know that once I've purchased the gear that I need, I'll be paying forward your incredible generosity by donating the extra to a few organizations dedicated to providing music education to the ""voiceless."" 
I promise to post info on the specifics as soon as I get off the road, but for tonight, it's late and I'll sign off-- with the utmost gratitude, joy, and thanks to each of you.
 
Love,
Corinna
 
-----------
Hi! Corinna here. I'm a fiddler/violinist and a music teacher, and I'm incredibly lucky to get to do what I love for a living (well, almost a living anyway!) I've been playing violin for 20 years, and I hope to play for another 80!!
Last month while on tour with the Adam Ezra Group (www.adamezra.com) in Bloomington, Indiana, my beloved fiddle was stolen from backstage during a concert. That instrument had been with me since I was 14, through adventures and auditions, weddings and funerals, parties, performances, and practice sessions, and had been my voice ever since I knew I even had a voice. It was the only material possession I had really cared about, and suddenly it was gone. I was heartbroken.
 
I filed a police report, called over 100 pawn shops and instrument dealers, kept a vigilant eye on eBay and craigslist, and blasted facebook with the information (which my friends shared more than 500 times!), and spent an embarrassing amount of time crying and worrying about the safety and well-being of my four-stringed friend. Fortunately, I had the help of some really generous folks, who spread the word, helped make calls, and even loaned me a violin to perform with while I searched. But unfortunately my own instrument has not been recovered.
 
So, I began the quest for a new violin which would give me back my voice and my career...
 
I’m thrilled to tell you now that I’ve found something I really love! This instrument, a 1933 John Aschower violin made in California, was tucked into a corner of my local violin shop and as soon as I started playing it, I felt like it had potential. The good people at Shar were kind enough to loan it to me, and every day that I’ve been playing it, I’ve loved it even more.
 
It feels GREAT to get my voice back!
 
Thanks to my parents’ good judgment getting my violin insured years ago, as well as the generosity of the good folks at Shar who are giving me a great deal, I’m not starting from scratch trying to fundraise for this instrument. But I do still have a ways to go—a little over 4 thousand dollars—which from the perspective of a traveling musician, is a LOT of money.
 
So, I'm launching this campaign to try to raise the rest- no more, no less. I hope there'll be some rewards you enjoy, and that together, we can turn my small tragedy into a happy occasion for everyone! I’m so thankful for the kindness and generosity I’ve been shown, and I want to show you how much I appreciate it. Please check out the rewards in the column—and if you think of something you’d like which isn’t listed, let me know!
 
Thanks for reading, thanks for supporting me, thanks for being a part of my life and this craziness called being a musician! I couldn’t do it without you.
 
TRULY- thank you.

<p><strong>(1929-1992)</strong></p>
<p>“One of the most heard guitar players in the world.” Throughout the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, HR was one of the busiest guitarists in Los Angeles, appearing on hundreds of album, movie and TV dates, and his own LPs established him as one of the premier jazz guitar stylists of his generation. He applied a lifelong passion for learning theory to writing books and columns as well as conducting legendary seminars. His efforts raised the standards for guitar education and culminated in the establishment of Guitar Institute of Technology, the world’s first full-time contemporary guitar program. (now Musicians Institute)</p>
<p>HR’s accomplishments are far too vast to detail in this forum, but a recent article in Vintage Guitar Magazine, by Jim Carlton, gives a good historical perspective:</p>

<p><strong>Who is Jay Roberts?</strong></p>
<p>As the son of two professional Jazz Musicians, Jay was inspired to listen to, learn and play music at an early age. He began teaching guitar and drums at age 14, and went on to open <a href=""http://robertsmusicinstitute.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>ROBERTS MUSIC INSTITUTE</span></a> in 2004.(the leading guitar school in the Northwest)</p>
<p>Howard and Jay were very close and collaborated on numerous educational projects and publications. They worked together daily until HR’s tragic passing in 1992. As he did for so many, HR instilled in Jay his set of ‘lifemanship’ qualities that have proven indelible: <strong>Kindness, Honesty &amp; Chops</strong></p>
<p>Today, following in his Fathers footsteps as a uniquely talented Improviser, Jay is excited  to honor what Howard frequently referred to as The BIG NOW… Collaborating with HR’s friends and colleagues creates an inspiring and significant opportunity, and one in which YOU play a pivotal role-</p>

<p><strong>Studio time to record / produce the song = $1,200</strong>  <em>( I paid this out of my pocket … well, actually my parents did).</em>  This will not be reimbursed through this project, I just wanted you to know what it cost to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Professional video crew</strong> (2–day shoot) = $2,700</p>
<p><strong>Editing &amp; Production</strong> = $1,600</p>
<p><strong>Promotion &amp; Distribution</strong> = $700 </p>
<p><em>(* if we exceed our goal , any extra funds will be used for further promotion of the video)</em></p>
<h3>What is in it for You?</h3>
<p>In addition to my eternal thanks, I want to offer some really cool perks to anyone who joins me.  Besides the “stuff” I think you’d like to have, I want to offer a real solution to bullying, so I’m working with some fantastic people who teach bullying prevention to kids all across the country.  They have a great bullying prevention program called <strong>Agent G</strong>, and this DVD should be seen by every child and every parent.   You can get one by supporting this project.  </p>
<p>You can also get a “Made to Be Me” t-shirt  <em>(I have different colors and designs)</em> … you can choose the perfect one and let everyone know that you <strong>BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!</strong> </p>
<p>I just recorded my first CD with 14 original songs – You can get one of those and let me know if you enjoy my music.</p>
<p>Are you a songwriter?  Want a song written for you?  You can get a songwriting session with me.  How about a powerful Bullying Prevention seminar for your group with expert instructors; and/or a private concert by me??  Check it all out in the perks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all know about bullying, and the devastating effect it can have on people – especially kids.  The song and video don’t just talk about the problem of bullying, but rather the SOLUTION!   I want people to know how to deal with bullying, and even more importantly … how to prevent it.</p>
<p>I’m so excited because a handful of organizations, and a HUGE bullying awareness website have agreed to feature the video once it is done, so I know that the video will be seen by a kazillion people and make a real impact.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you watching this and I’m so grateful for any help you can give me.  If this video touches the life of just one person … its all worth it.  So tell all your friends and join the MADE TO BE ME movement!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.  Ask all your people to get the word out and make some noise about <strong><em>Made to Be Me</em></strong>, and remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!  Bless you!</p>
</div>
<p> </p></div>","Who. What. Why?
Hey, my name is Tenasie, and I just finished recording my latest song and I want to do something really special with this one because it is about something near and dear to my heart … bullying. 
I am going to create a music video and send it out around the world to continue to bring awareness to bullying.  And I need your help to make this happen.    
The song is called Made to Be Me – and it has a  POSITIVE & POWERFUL message … Believe in yourself, follow your dreams, and be a leader.

My Story


Originally from Austin Texas, I moved out to LA 2 years ago and into the most intense period of emotional and spiritual development I've experienced this lifetime.Somewhere in the middle of all this growth I began living on a modest sailboat and meditating, writing, and expressing all that I'd felt in my previous relationship.
In this process, with the help of some amazing friends, I recognized that there's nothing to forgive others of only things to forgive within myself and that all the pain and frustration that I'd felt so deeply all stemmed from ancient wounds that had very little to do with my last partner.
These songs emerged as gifts to aid me in embodying these realizations and
now that they've delivered me into a new life I wish to share them with the world.


About the EP ""Leave on the Lights""

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Summary<br/>
</h3><p>Hi my name is H.E. and I am a musician and artist putting together an album of catchy songs and video art, based on my 1st Single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOjOiGUVZ48"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Everytime You're Gone</a>. Most of the songs are actually written but being a sucker for complex arrangements and tight production, it's going to take time. Which is basically the reason you're here, reading this: You can have a direct effect on just how long it's going to take.<br/></p><h3>Who's H.E.?<br/>
</h3><p>For those who don't know me: I've started out in the UK music industry in the early 2000's as a teen, at the infamous Motor Museum Studios in Liverpool, through which an incredible array of artists went through (Oasis, Travis, Arctic Monkeys, The dead 60's, Atomic Kitten, OMD; Kraftwerk, the LA's, just to name a few).</p><p>Initially I was a singer/guitarist but after switching to producing, success came quickly and I felt quite comfortable working outside the spotlight, especially since I got to learn how to make hit records from some of the most incredible talents. At some point however, I realized that there was more to me than supplying other artists with ideas and material and I set out to do my own thing. </p><p>What I didn't have though at that point was much life experience. After all, I had spent my entire youth in dark smoky rooms (called recording studios), hanging out with freaks. If I've had known that it'd take years to find my own voice as an artist, I'd have probably just stuck with what I had back than, but being stubborn, I just went for it anyways.<br/></p><p>Today I am pretty clear about my path and with the support of my amazing family and inspiring community here in Mokpo, South Korea, I am busy working on the 1st album of my own songs. Thanx to my past I am even in the luxurious position of being able to write and produce myself (which is generally not  recommended but in my case seems too work well). <br/></p>Anyways, when I started this project in 2011, I had not quite figured out how to go about 
making videos but now that I have, it's become apparent that the equipment I had 
budgeted for, turns out embarrassingly inadequate. To give you an idea: to make the drawings for the 1st video took about 2 weeks - to put them together in the computer took 4 month (mainly starring a progress bars)! Which is...<br/><br/><h3>...Where you come in<br/>
</h3><br/><ul>
<li>When, thanks to your brilliant support, we'll have hit the target of 2000€ ($2700) we'll be able to replace some seriously outdated PC Hardware to help cut down the production time of videos from 3-4 month to approx. 4 weeks (=Album out Winter 2014)<br/>
</li>
<li>If we go beyond the target (e.g.  €3000 / $4000), we'll be able to upgrade some audio equipment also and thus have more songs come your way even faster (= Album summer/fall 2014)<br/>
</li>
<li>Should you go nuts and support the hell out of this, any additional funds will be allocated to Marketing, which otherwise would be subject to a separate campaign<br/>
</li>
<li>In case we miss the target, no worries, new stuff will come, it's just gonna take a whoooooooooooole lot longer...<br/>
</li>
</ul>In Essence, any contribution of yours will accelerate the project. So if you're ready to see how it feels to be a living turbo booster - take a look to the right of the screen and pick one or more items that suit you. There's all kinds of stuff reaching from<br/><br style=""font-weight: bold;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Music/Art</span><br/><br/><ul>

Hi my name is H.E. and I am a musician and artist putting together an album of catchy songs and video art, based on my 1st Single Everytime You're Gone. Most of the songs are actually written but being a sucker for complex arrangements and tight production, it's going to take time. Which is basically the reason you're here, reading this: You can have a direct effect on just how long it's going to take.Who's H.E.?
For those who don't know me: I've started out in the UK music industry in the early 2000's as a teen, at the infamous Motor Museum Studios in Liverpool, through which an incredible array of artists went through (Oasis, Travis, Arctic Monkeys, The dead 60's, Atomic Kitten, OMD; Kraftwerk, the LA's, just to name a few).Initially I was a singer/guitarist but after switching to producing, success came quickly and I felt quite comfortable working outside the spotlight, especially since I got to learn how to make hit records from some of the most incredible talents. At some point however, I realized that there was more to me than supplying other artists with ideas and material and I set out to do my own thing. What I didn't have though at that point was much life experience. After all, I had spent my entire youth in dark smoky rooms (called recording studios), hanging out with freaks. If I've had known that it'd take years to find my own voice as an artist, I'd have probably just stuck with what I had back than, but being stubborn, I just went for it anyways.Today I am pretty clear about my path and with the support of my amazing family and inspiring community here in Mokpo, South Korea, I am busy working on the 1st album of my own songs. Thanx to my past I am even in the luxurious position of being able to write and produce myself (which is generally not  recommended but in my case seems too work well). Anyways, when I started this project in 2011, I had not quite figured out how to go about 
making videos but now that I have, it's become apparent that the equipment I had 
budgeted for, turns out embarrassingly inadequate. To give you an idea: to make the drawings for the 1st video took about 2 weeks - to put them together in the computer took 4 month (mainly starring a progress bars)! Which is......Where you come in

When, thanks to your brilliant support, we'll have hit the target of 2000€ ($2700) we'll be able to replace some seriously outdated PC Hardware to help cut down the production time of videos from 3-4 month to approx. 4 weeks (=Album out Winter 2014)

If we go beyond the target (e.g.  €3000 / $4000), we'll be able to upgrade some audio equipment also and thus have more songs come your way even faster (= Album summer/fall 2014)

Should you go nuts and support the hell out of this, any additional funds will be allocated to Marketing, which otherwise would be subject to a separate campaign

In case we miss the target, no worries, new stuff will come, it's just gonna take a whoooooooooooole lot longer...

One dollar out of every 10 raised towards the album will be donated to <b>Charity:Water</b>. And 100% of that money will go to provide clean drinking
water. It's a win-win! Information on <b>Charity:Water</b>, updates on
funding and news from the studio will be posted throughout the campaign.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hey There!</p>
<p>I'm Ryan Kirkland. I'm a Singer/Songwriter from Southern California. Some of you may know, that for about five and a half years I was in a band from Orlando, FL called Between The Trees. We had some great success and a lot of fun during that time, and impacted people along the way. That might even be why you're here now. But when I felt called away from the band, I made one of the scariest steps of faith I had ever made in my entire life. </p>
<p>I knew that one day I would write/record again, but not in that moment. This step was away from all of that. This step was into the unknown. I had no plan, no sure direction, but I knew it was right. Within the first few hours of that step I immediately felt peace. Unbelievable peace. Unlike anything I had ever felt before. I wrote at least three songs that week!</p>
<p>The emotion and the words couldn't come quick enough! But something was still pulling at me. So I stayed focused on what was pulling me and never quite kept complete focus on the music. And the music kept coming! It was so freeing! I know that some of you don't believe the same things I do. But I know now that God was showing me He had me! And with a little trust, and the letting go of what I wanted, I found me! Again, I know you may be reading this and not believe what I believe, but if you could just imagine yourself in the exact place you know you're supposed to be, doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing, and feeling the most complete you have ever felt... That's what I felt like when I wrote these songs.</p>
<p>I've been writing ever since I left for California 2 years ago, and I haven't stopped. Among the fights and the fears, the joy and sorrow, I keep writing. And I finally feel like it's time to put it all down! I hope to put out as many records as I can this year, but lets just try and start with one for now! :) </p>
<p>I'm super excited that I will be recording with one of my all time favorite producers, Stuart Brawley! Stu was the same producer Between The Trees worked with on our Spain record! He is an incredible guy and a very talented and seasoned writer and producer. Stu has worked with some of the greatest voices in music (Michael Jackson, Don Henley, Celine Dion, Barbara Streisand, Lenka...  and I feel so blessed to call him a friend and a colleague. I won't go on and on, but you can see a little more into who Stuart Brawley is and who he's worked with here: <a href=""http://www.stuartbrawley.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stuartbrawley.com</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need around $18,000 to pay for recording costs, (producer, gear, time, musicians) and the rest will be for travel, lodging and the manufacturing and completion of all the perks. ABSOLUTELY NONE of the money is going in my pocket!</p>
<p>For this, I've been thinking up some common and not so common perks!</p>
<p><b>$5 - Thanks!</b>  I know that times are hard but like ""My MoOom"" always says, ""every little bit counts!"" I'll include a digital download of one of the songs.</p>
<p><b>$15 - The Sounds.</b>  You will recieve a hard copy of the record with a handwritten Thank You.</p>
<p><b>$25 - The Connection. </b> A signed hard copy of the record and a surprise bonus track inside your copy!</p>
<p><b>$50 - The Swag.</b> All the above and a limited addition shirt that will only be available during this campaign.</p>
<p><b>$100 - The Ink. </b>  In addition to the above, instead of just the handwritten note, I will also include your name in the thank you's on the inside of the CD jacket.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$150 - The Insight.  </b>Are you a budding songwriter or artist? Have some songs that you'd like feedback on? Submit 3 songs to Ryan's producer, Stuart Brawley, and he'll write up a critique of your songs. Melody, structure, lyric, arrangement will all be considered. If you don't have recordings and want to come to our studio in LA, you can come play 3 songs for Stuart and he'll give you feedback and suggestions, live and in person.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$150 - The Local.</b>  This is for those local to (or those planning to be local to) Southern California. In addition to all the above, we'll set up a day for you to come up to LA and spend the entire day in the studio with me!</p>
<p><b>$250 - The Skype Show.</b>  Excluding ""The Local"" you get all the above, as well as a skype acoustic show for you and whoever you want! I'll show you some songs from the record. Catch up! And maybe even sing some older favorites!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$400 - The House Show.</b>  Excluding the ""Local"" and the ""Skype Show"", you get all of the above and Acoustic show in your home. You can invite whoever you want!      <i>*must be within 75 miles Driving Distance of Orange County. We will work out the specific date via Email or Phone</i></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$500 - The Demo.  </b>So you're an indie artist or wish you were.  You've written a couple songs, and really want to record them.  Come to the studio and give the whole music biz thing a try!   Includes 3 hours in the studio with Stuart to record your demo.  Solo performances, not full bands please!</p>
<p>If you're not a singer/songwriter but know one, this would make a great Christmas gift!</p>
<p><b>$600 - The Blessing. </b> If you are giving this, then you are blowing my mind right now! I will give you your pick of all the above and would love to just be able to personally call and thank you from the bottom of my heart! And personally invite you to the CD release, whenever/If ever that takes place. </p>
<p>If for some reason we don't hit our goal, I plan to put all the money toward getting the record done and fullfilling as many of the perks as I can. If I run out before I do, then I will start selling copies and using the proceeds to complete all the perks. I promise to be honest and trustworthy with the blessing you are placing on me.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I have been involved with music and leading worship for 27 years.  I am currently serving as worship director at Grace Church in Hudson, MA.  It has always been a dream of mind to take some of my original music along with worship favorites and put them into an album.  I don’t know if it was lack of confidence or time, but I was never able to get around to making it happen.  </p>
<p>In July of 2017, my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.  He passed away later that year.  Through the entire journey of his illness, he echoed one request of me. You need to record.  So in January of 2018, I drove out to Old Bear Studios near Buffalo, NY to work producer Chris Hoisginton and record the first track of this new album. This past January I headed back to NY with my wife to spend two days writing and finishing songs to round out the remaining tracks.  Now it’s time to record the rest of the project.  Unfortunately, my dad was never able to hear the first track before he passed, but with your help, I can honor his request and hopefully bless the body of Christ with some great songs to sing in troubled times.  </p>
<p>The album will be called “Faithful.”  If there is one thing my family and I have experienced over the past few years as we have journeyed through the loss of loved ones and significant life changes are that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.  He will never leave us or forsake us.  That if we seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, all the things we need in this life will be taken care of.  I hope that as you hear these songs, your faith will be strengthened. That you will have a new sense of hope. Not hope in yourself, but hope in a Jesus who is ready and able to save.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>So what do we need to make this happen?  The cost of finishing this album is $11,000.  It seems like a large sum of money, but if we do this together, anything is possible.  I have made a significant investment already in studio time, travel, and related expenses, but to finish the work, I will need your help.  </p>
<p>If you are able to partner with me, I have a whole list of perks from a simple digital download to a full band worship night.  Would you consider becoming a partner?</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this album is to shine a light on God’s faithfulness.  </p>
<p>“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”(Romans 8:38-39) </p>
<p>“Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God  who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,”(Deuteronomy 7:9)</p>
<p>“If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.”(2 Timothy 2:13 )</p>
<p>“Your faithfulness endures to all generations;  you have established the earth, and it stands fast.”( Psalms 119:90  )</p>
<p>“Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.”( Hebrews 10:23  )</p>
<p>“The LORD’S loving kindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness.”( Lamentations 3:22-23 )</p>
<p>“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”( Deuteronomy 31:6 )</p>
<p>My desire is that these songs would become anthems for you in times of anxiety, worry, and doubt, like they were and are for me.  </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The biggest risk in this project is putting myself out there.  Will anyone even pledge?  What happens if all the money is not raised?  I have prayerfully, along with my family, determined that this is what God wants me to do.  That he used the situation with my dad to push me towards His will.  So with that, you can know that every dollar raised will go toward the recording of this project.  If we do not raise enough, I will use the money we do raise to record as much as I can.  I refuse to cut corners on the project so I will not record something sub par to just finish.  If we raise more money than what is needed, I will record more songs.  I have enough materiel to record a 10 song album, but thought a 6 song EP would be a more attainable goal.  </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I understand that for some of you, pledging money is not an option.  I work in full time church ministry so being tight on funds is a daily struggle.  But there are still ways you can get involved.</p>
<p>First, please pray for me and the team recording.  It is a long process that we want to do well.  Pray that we stay healthy and that travel to and from the studio is safe.  Pray that in every note that is played, the Holy Spirit speaks to the hearts of those who will listen.  Pray that through the project, many will come to know Jesus and follow Him for the rest of their lives.  </p>
<p>Oh…and share the heck out this.  Tell all your friends and family.  If my ministry has affected you in any way, let people know so they can get involved.  </p>
