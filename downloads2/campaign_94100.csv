<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>My name is Corinna Del Bianco and I am researcher in architecture and urban studies and I’m Adjunct Professor of urban design at the Politecnico di Milano. My research and professional interests regard local development and I conduct documentation and analysis of the cultural identity of places with a focus on the culture of living in self-built urban environments. I am founder and board member of the Fondazione Romualdo Del Bianco, a private foundation based in Florence, Italy, dedicated to creating dialogues among cultures through heritage and travel. In 2020 I founded the Studio Corinna Del Bianco in which I conduct research, curatorship projects and educational activities on the topics of architecture and urban design.</p> <p><strong>The project</strong></p>
<p>Since the second half of the twentieth century, the majority of the islands in the Mediterranean Sea have turned their economic activity exclusively to tourism, abandoning their history, their productive realities and subsequently their cultural identities. These islands—from the Pelagie to the Cyclades—hold rich diversity in terms of location, conformation, resources and history.</p> <p>Born in 2018, ‘Archipelago’ is a research project that intends to document and valorize the diversity of the cultural identities of the Mediterranean islands. It considers all archipelagos and islands, particularly those which are inhabited, seeking to uncover the relationships that dwellings and architecture create with the sea and the land. The project revolves around photography, maps and a selection of recommended readings. It is a long-term project that is expected to span 50 years, of which the first goal is representing the Italian islands.</p>
<p>The debut exhibition of the project was asked to be shown at the Italian Cultural Institute in Hamburg, Germany in December 2021. The exhibition will showcase a combination of maps and photographs of a selection of Italian archipelagos: the Tuscan Archipelago (Arcipelago Toscano), Aegadian Islands (Isole Egadi), Aeolian Islands (Isole Eolie) and the Pelagie Islands (Isole Pelagie).</p>
<p>Following the visit to Hamburg, the exhibition is expected to travel to other premises around the world.</p> <p><strong>What I need and what you get</strong></p>
<p>I need approximately € 6000 to print the 48 photographs and perks that form the core component of the exhibition. The photographs will be printed from a reputable, local printing studio in Hamburg. You can donate any amount (no matter how small!) and I will include your name on the list of acknowledgements (unless you would rather remain anonymous). Alternatively, you can claim one of the perks that I am offering. These include 5 limited-edition postcards or a copy of the exhibition book (electronic or print). If I fall short of the goal, whatever money I receive will still be used to print and frame the photographs at the highest quality.</p> <p><strong>The impact</strong></p>
<p>The exhibition raises awareness for the protection of culture by uncovering the beauty and diversity of the islands, helping to foster the development of new economies and protecting thousands of years of history.</p>

<p>The project <strong><em>""Northern Russian Monasteries""</em></strong> started several years ago by the team of the Russian photographer Oleg Yushkov. By now, a huge collection of top-quality images of major northern monasteries (particularly in Vologda region) has been gathered (in different seasons and weather conditions). Moreover, an illustrated album ""Volodga"" has already been published.</p>
<p>Now we are starting the next step of this project. Our team is planning to publish an illustrated album on Ferapontov monastery (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferapontov_Monastery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferapontov_Monastery</a>), one of the most beautiful and sophisticated monasteries in Russia, which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. We would like to attract attention to this great place and to rethink its history in our images.</p>
<p>Our team has already prepared all the images for the project (we are pleased to present some of them to you here) and also a text in Russian and English about the long and rich history of the monastery.</p>
<p>Now we need funds to finalize the project and publish the illustrated album ""Ferapontov monastery"". If we reach our funding goal, we will be able to publish it by end October 2013.</p>

<strong>THE PROGRAM</strong> We are the <strong>Dawson College Commercial Photography</strong>
 Graduates of Winter 2013. The goal of this program is to give 
graduating students the technical, visual &amp; business skills to 
perform commercial tasks typically done by self-employed or staff 
photographers in a manner that meets industry &amp; professional 
standards. We have been instructed in various aspects of professional 
photography including advertising &amp; editorial illustration, 
portraiture, catalogue photography, architectural photography, fashion 
photography, industrial photography &amp; digital imaging. In courses 
designed to cover both theory &amp; practice, we learned to use small 
&amp; large format cameras, tungsten &amp; electronic flash for studio 
or location lighting, &amp; computer imaging software for output &amp; 
media applications. Throughout the program, a mature &amp; disciplined 
approach to commercial photography was emphasized &amp; at the same 
time, we were encouraged to develop a personal creative vision of the 
world.</p>
<p>
<strong>THE VERNISSAGE</strong> We have finally reached the culmination 
of all of our work – it is time to graduate, &amp; exhibit our work to 
friends, fans, potential clients &amp; buyers. We will be holding a 
Vernissage at Dawson College, &amp; we are in need of contributions to 
further our potential for success as we head into the workforce. That is
 where you come in -- your money will be helping to fund our Vernissage 
in order to make it the most impressive visual presentation possible.</p>
<p>
<strong>THE GOAL</strong> We have 1500$ granted to us by the college, 
but that only goes so far with nearly 20 graduates. We are hoping to 
raise a total of 5000$. This money will go to the matting &amp; 
potential framing of portfolios, producing our promo book, refreshments 
for the exhibition, printing of posters &amp; so on. Regardless of 
whether we reach our entire goal or not, the money will be going 
straight to the Vernissage – we will produce our exhibition in the most 
economical &amp; visually inspiring manner with the funding we have. The
 more funding we have, the more effective our exhibit will be.</p>
<p>
<strong>THE IMPORTANCE</strong> Some of us will soon be off to find 
employment in the field as assistants or employees, whereas others will 
be diving head first into opening their own studios &amp; businesses. 
This is not the only portfolio we will ever produce, but for many of us 
this Vernissage is a golden opportunity to get a head start in the 
industry here in Montreal. The reason this Vernissage is so important is
 due to the fact that industry professionals will be viewing our work --
 these guests may provide possible business ventures for us in the 
future, &amp; we want to impress. We understand that not everyone can 
contribute a monetary value to our campaign -- however, you can still 
help by spreading the word or donating goods &amp; services to our 
exhibition. We really appreciate your help!</p>

about the Europe’s CLIMATE KILLER NUMBER ONE with a unique perspective of
direct struggles against its chaotic influences on the local environment and
climate in general</b>. Exhibitions will firstly take place in West Germany, in
towns around the largest opencast mine in Europe—the main causer of all the
alarming issues explained in the further text.
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<h2><u>The situation:</u></h2>
<p>A 12.000 years old &amp; once the biggest forest in the region, <b>the
beautiful Hambach forest is being completely destroyed because of the largest
opencast mine in Europe</b>—located in the west Germany, around 25 km west from
Cologne [50.91061, 6.517956 <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/XIFoa"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://goo.gl/maps/XIFoa</span></a>]<b>.</b> The Hambach opencast mine „measures 85 sq km and contains 2.5
billion tons of lignite at a depth of up to 450m“. The responsible owner of
this mine and many others in the region is the leading power company, the
notorious RWE [<a href=""http://www.rwe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.rwe.com</span></a>]. The process goes like this: They cut trees, dig out the earth couple of
hundreds meters deep, then excavate the brown coal (also called <i>lignite</i>),
transport it by trains to some of many power plants situated around the mine
where they burn the brown coal to produce electric energy. So far I know, <b>the
Rhenish lignite-mining area, or it's better to say RWE is the climate killer
number one in Europe</b>—achieving all the bad highscores.</p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/18534/files/20130818003935-HAMBACH1.jpg?1376811575"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p></span><blockquote>
<span class=""notranlsate""><i>To dig out they use the world's biggest
excavators which are 220m long, 96m high &amp; weigh 13,500 tons. „Every day,
they can extract 240,000 tons of coal – enough to fill up a football stadium
30m high.“</i></span><br/><span class=""notranlsate""></span>
</blockquote>
<span class=""notranlsate""><br/><b>The most dirtiest &amp; non-renewable way possible.</b> What is left behind? A
giant hole, actually the biggest on our continent &amp; that's not all.



<p><b>People are being permanently evicted</b> because of the expansion of the mines in
the surrounding area and future greedy plans of the RWE company. I've seen
three former villages where the entire life has been completely dislocated and
merged into, let say, one new little town—the company moved everything, stuff
from the churches, cemeteries.... everything. People's lifes have been
interupted as well as their former neighborhoods which will be completely
destroyed as the mines around are getting bigger.</p>
<p>The <b>radioactive fine/respirable dust</b> coming out of the mine (more
fine dust than all car traffic in Germany) is causing serious health problems
to lots of people in the surrounding area. Because the excavators are mining
24/7 including the night time as well, the emission of loud noise is a <b>big
problem for animals</b> in the forest and the strong light is <b>polluting our
sky</b> (the mine at night looks like the surface of the Moon, but not that
calm at all!). What also happens is subsidence and loss of aquifers which
affects local farmers who have to irrigate crops more often. Of course there's
also a great amount of CO2 being emitted by RWE ‒ close to 100,000,000 tonnes
per year ‒ and they are planning to build even more power plants in the near
future. They just built the new railway for transporting coal and in
cooperation with the road construction company they built a new section of the
highway between Düren &amp; Kerpen because the Hambach opencast mine is growing
[official info: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1bySwJc"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://bit.ly/1bySwJc</span></a>].</p>
<p>With its high proportion of oak, small-leaf linden etc. the Hambach forest
is an ecologically valuable habitat for a host of endangered <b>plant &amp;
animal species</b> (for example rare speices of bat and mice) which are <b>in
danger</b> since the Hambach opencast mine is active and their natural
territory is becoming smaller. Once upon a time the forest covered an area of
5,500 hectares. Unfortunatelly, more and more trees are being cut down every
year.</p>
<p>I'm worried that people's relationship to the nature is being lost because
RWE and such companies are irretrievably &amp; greedily destroying everything
on their way just to make more money. They calculate values in how many times
per day the excavators are turning the big bucket-wheel, they calculate on how
many vagons of coal they have transported each day etc. I keep asking myself:
<b>How RWE can do all this crime to the nature &amp; people who live there,
legally; and where is all this going?</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<h2><u>About me:</u></h2>
<p>My name is Danijel Šivinjski and I'm a photographer &amp; artist passionate
about documentary and experimental work. I'm coming from Istria, the north-west
coast of Croatia, but I’m currently living and working in Serbia. As a
documentary photographer I am mostly focused on the social &amp; environmental
issues and as an artist I desire to discover the next level &amp; ask deeper
questions. Check my website <a href=""http://www.sivinjski.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.sivinjski.com</span></a> or check some of my previous documentary
work below on this page.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<h2><u>The story:</u></h2>
<p>I was shocked last year when I've heard what's going on around the Hambach
opencast mine. But, on the other hand, I was happy to see there's also a group
of activists in the forest next to the mine, struggling against its bad
influences [their blog <a href=""http://hambachforest.blogsport.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://hambachforest.blogsport.de</span></a>]. I've contacted them and decided to come and do a photo reportage about
their activities.</p>
<p>On 14th of April 2012. a group of activist squatted a part of the Hambach
forest which was threatened by clear cutting. They established an occupation
camp there, built treehouses, installed hanging platforms and built wooden
houses on the ground as well. This whole infrastructure in the camp was a new
meeting point for people to connect, debate about issues of the mining area,
but also a place for growing the culture of resistance. People there were
horrified about the total destruction of life &amp; nature and said „<i>the
current politics totally failed and keep on failing in answering the pressing
matter of climate change!“</i>. The activists are not only protecting the
forest, but also asking a very important question: <i>“What do we want our
economy to look like in the future, if we do not want to destroy the climate of
this planet?”.</i> Burning fossil fuels is for sure not the answer and
companies like RWE shall loose their <i>„right“</i> of determining the future
of our planet, unscrupulously destroying the local &amp; global fundaments of
life.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<b>
</b><h2><b>My photo story is all about the struggle:</b></h2>
<b>This is a story about very brave people
who decided to put their lives on the line and fight against „legal“
destruction of complete life under, on and above the ground.</b> I spent lots of
time with the activists in the forest and around the mine trying to capture all
more-or-less crucial moments of the struggle; struggle was my main focus. At
some point I realised that I was the only photographer present in some of
direct actions and that my role is becoming more important, role of documenting
these historical events.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/18535/files/20130818004020-HAMBACH2.jpg?1376811620"" src="""" style=""""/></p>After some time direct actions became more
effective and caused more damage to RWE, as on the other side RWE’s mining
activities caused more damage to the nature as well. I felt like moving on a
thin line <b>between these two conflict sides</b> and that’s actually what I summed up
in a story for this unique photo exhibition.
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In November it took 4 days for 500 police officers to evict the first
forest occupation. That was the longest and most expensive eviction in Germany
so far. During the eviction I was also arrested, unjustifiably, as the only
journalist <i>(independent photojournalist)</i>, the only who has some really
important photographs of that terrible police event.</p>
<p>Since the eviction there exists the second occupation camp on the the
meadow close to the forest. They have survived a cold winter and are still
struggling. Fortunatelly, as before, they are gathering a big support from the
local people.</p>
<p>After the whole experience, my photo story became very deep so I decided to
come back again and finally exhibit.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<h2><u>Why this exhibition is important:</u></h2>
<p>I believe my photographic documentation of this very specific activist
struggles is very important as an <b>awareness factor of delivering the truth</b>
direct to the people; as well as a celebration of past fights and inspiration
for the potential future ones. I believe that the artistic language of my
photographs means <i>“change”</i>. </p>
<p>The exhibition shows specific aesthetics, the beauty of <i>“here &amp; now”</i>.
 It shows contents and ideas about the real world, nature, human beings
&amp; life. It has ethical base, moral weight and for that a deep humanistic
nature. Documentary photography is here to communicate between the viewer and
reality without any drastic post-production, just pure frozen moments.
Photography as a medium can touch people's emotions and awake their
consciousness of the reality, which can inspire and motivate them for taking
constructive actions or joining such a movement.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<h2><u>Why your support is important:</u></h2>
<p>I kept all the photographs unpublic for a whole year now and <b>I need your
support to make them public</b>. I need funds simply for two things: to print
photographs and buy a two-way bus ticket to Germany. You can donate/buy perks <i>(listed on the right)</i> by Credit Card or via PayPal; if none of these options are not working for you but you still wanna donate please contact me to danijel {at} sivinjski {dot} com.<br/></p>
<p>To give back I’ve prepared unique perks for you: <b>A Photo Book with Extended
Story</b> (limited edition; larger selection of photographs with descriptions),
<b>an Exclusive Sneak-peak Catalogue</b> (all the photographs that will be
exhibited), <b>special Thank-You letters</b> and a big set of <b>signed photo
prints</b>. All the perks will be high-quality printed &amp; shipped directly
to you.</p>
<p><br/></p>

about the Europe’s CLIMATE KILLER NUMBER ONE with a unique perspective of
direct struggles against its chaotic influences on the local environment and
climate in general. Exhibitions will firstly take place in West Germany, in
towns around the largest opencast mine in Europe—the main causer of all the
alarming issues explained in the further text.


The situation:
A 12.000 years old & once the biggest forest in the region, the
beautiful Hambach forest is being completely destroyed because of the largest
opencast mine in Europe—located in the west Germany, around 25 km west from
Cologne [50.91061, 6.517956 http://goo.gl/maps/XIFoa]. The Hambach opencast mine „measures 85 sq km and contains 2.5
billion tons of lignite at a depth of up to 450m“. The responsible owner of
this mine and many others in the region is the leading power company, the
notorious RWE [http://www.rwe.com]. The process goes like this: They cut trees, dig out the earth couple of
hundreds meters deep, then excavate the brown coal (also called lignite),
transport it by trains to some of many power plants situated around the mine
where they burn the brown coal to produce electric energy. So far I know, the
Rhenish lignite-mining area, or it's better to say RWE is the climate killer
number one in Europe—achieving all the bad highscores.

To dig out they use the world's biggest
excavators which are 220m long, 96m high & weigh 13,500 tons. „Every day,
they can extract 240,000 tons of coal – enough to fill up a football stadium
30m high.“

The most dirtiest & non-renewable way possible. What is left behind? A
giant hole, actually the biggest on our continent & that's not all.



People are being permanently evicted because of the expansion of the mines in
the surrounding area and future greedy plans of the RWE company. I've seen
three former villages where the entire life has been completely dislocated and
merged into, let say, one new little town—the company moved everything, stuff
from the churches, cemeteries.... everything. People's lifes have been
interupted as well as their former neighborhoods which will be completely
destroyed as the mines around are getting bigger.
The radioactive fine/respirable dust coming out of the mine (more
fine dust than all car traffic in Germany) is causing serious health problems
to lots of people in the surrounding area. Because the excavators are mining
24/7 including the night time as well, the emission of loud noise is a big
problem for animals in the forest and the strong light is polluting our
sky (the mine at night looks like the surface of the Moon, but not that
calm at all!). What also happens is subsidence and loss of aquifers which
affects local farmers who have to irrigate crops more often. Of course there's
also a great amount of CO2 being emitted by RWE ‒ close to 100,000,000 tonnes
per year ‒ and they are planning to build even more power plants in the near
future. They just built the new railway for transporting coal and in
cooperation with the road construction company they built a new section of the
highway between Düren & Kerpen because the Hambach opencast mine is growing
[official info: http://bit.ly/1bySwJc].
With its high proportion of oak, small-leaf linden etc. the Hambach forest
is an ecologically valuable habitat for a host of endangered plant &
animal species (for example rare speices of bat and mice) which are in
danger since the Hambach opencast mine is active and their natural
territory is becoming smaller. Once upon a time the forest covered an area of
5,500 hectares. Unfortunatelly, more and more trees are being cut down every
year.
I'm worried that people's relationship to the nature is being lost because
RWE and such companies are irretrievably & greedily destroying everything
on their way just to make more money. They calculate values in how many times
per day the excavators are turning the big bucket-wheel, they calculate on how
many vagons of coal they have transported each day etc. I keep asking myself:
How RWE can do all this crime to the nature & people who live there,
legally; and where is all this going?


About me:
My name is Danijel Šivinjski and I'm a photographer & artist passionate
about documentary and experimental work. I'm coming from Istria, the north-west
coast of Croatia, but I’m currently living and working in Serbia. As a
documentary photographer I am mostly focused on the social & environmental
issues and as an artist I desire to discover the next level & ask deeper
questions. Check my website www.sivinjski.com or check some of my previous documentary
work below on this page.


The story:
I was shocked last year when I've heard what's going on around the Hambach
opencast mine. But, on the other hand, I was happy to see there's also a group
of activists in the forest next to the mine, struggling against its bad
influences [their blog http://hambachforest.blogsport.de]. I've contacted them and decided to come and do a photo reportage about
their activities.
On 14th of April 2012. a group of activist squatted a part of the Hambach
forest which was threatened by clear cutting. They established an occupation
camp there, built treehouses, installed hanging platforms and built wooden
houses on the ground as well. This whole infrastructure in the camp was a new
meeting point for people to connect, debate about issues of the mining area,
but also a place for growing the culture of resistance. People there were
horrified about the total destruction of life & nature and said „the
current politics totally failed and keep on failing in answering the pressing
matter of climate change!“. The activists are not only protecting the
forest, but also asking a very important question: “What do we want our
economy to look like in the future, if we do not want to destroy the climate of
this planet?”. Burning fossil fuels is for sure not the answer and
companies like RWE shall loose their „right“ of determining the future
of our planet, unscrupulously destroying the local & global fundaments of
life.



My photo story is all about the struggle:
This is a story about very brave people
who decided to put their lives on the line and fight against „legal“
destruction of complete life under, on and above the ground. I spent lots of
time with the activists in the forest and around the mine trying to capture all
more-or-less crucial moments of the struggle; struggle was my main focus. At
some point I realised that I was the only photographer present in some of
direct actions and that my role is becoming more important, role of documenting
these historical events.After some time direct actions became more
effective and caused more damage to RWE, as on the other side RWE’s mining
activities caused more damage to the nature as well. I felt like moving on a
thin line between these two conflict sides and that’s actually what I summed up
in a story for this unique photo exhibition.


In November it took 4 days for 500 police officers to evict the first
forest occupation. That was the longest and most expensive eviction in Germany
so far. During the eviction I was also arrested, unjustifiably, as the only
journalist (independent photojournalist), the only who has some really
important photographs of that terrible police event.
Since the eviction there exists the second occupation camp on the the
meadow close to the forest. They have survived a cold winter and are still
struggling. Fortunatelly, as before, they are gathering a big support from the
local people.
After the whole experience, my photo story became very deep so I decided to
come back again and finally exhibit.


Why this exhibition is important:
I believe my photographic documentation of this very specific activist
struggles is very important as an awareness factor of delivering the truth
direct to the people; as well as a celebration of past fights and inspiration
for the potential future ones. I believe that the artistic language of my
photographs means “change”. 
The exhibition shows specific aesthetics, the beauty of “here & now”.
 It shows contents and ideas about the real world, nature, human beings
& life. It has ethical base, moral weight and for that a deep humanistic
nature. Documentary photography is here to communicate between the viewer and
reality without any drastic post-production, just pure frozen moments.
Photography as a medium can touch people's emotions and awake their
consciousness of the reality, which can inspire and motivate them for taking
constructive actions or joining such a movement.


Why your support is important:
I kept all the photographs unpublic for a whole year now and I need your
support to make them public. I need funds simply for two things: to print
photographs and buy a two-way bus ticket to Germany. You can donate/buy perks (listed on the right) by Credit Card or via PayPal; if none of these options are not working for you but you still wanna donate please contact me to danijel {at} sivinjski {dot} com.
To give back I’ve prepared unique perks for you: A Photo Book with Extended
Story (limited edition; larger selection of photographs with descriptions),
an Exclusive Sneak-peak Catalogue (all the photographs that will be
exhibited), special Thank-You letters and a big set of signed photo
prints. All the perks will be high-quality printed & shipped directly
to you.

Funding details:
$600 =
$390 for printing photographs on film,
mounting on big plastic board & cutting into single
pieces;
$168 for traveling costs (two-way bus
ticket);
$42 Indiegogo Fees.
If I get more funds than asked I would
give a half to the activists and a half will use to travel with the exhibition
even more, to share the story with as many people as possible.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Helena and I am an amateur astrophotographer and astronomer from Scotland. I've always had a strong interest in space from a very young age but that interest grew even further when back in 2016 I applied for a programme called 'The Dengineers'. My application was successful and they came and built a dark sky observatory in my back garden! Having the den has changed my views on astrophotography and astronomy. It has motivated me to do more with my photographs, promote my work and even create a YouTube channel! Through this Indiegogo campaign, I am aiming to fundraise for a high-quality telescope with ED (Extra Low Dispersion) glass installed to minimise chromatic aberration (when more than one colour wavelength doesn't meet up causing false colour in the final image). By using your donations I can explore galaxies, globular clusters and supernovae from my observatory and inspire other young people with a love of astronomy! It would mean the world to me if you could check out my perks to see what you get back from donating. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise £800 to cover the costs of the SkyWatcher 80-ED-DS PRO Telescope, The HEQ5 PRO GO TO Mount and The Skywatcher Power Tank. You'll notice that in the mount's specifications it mentions GO TO. This means that I can track an object in the sky (let's say M42 The Orion Nebula for example) without having to move the telescope. Having this system will reduce noise, camera shake, and distortion in the final image, meaning I can share sharper images with you all. </p>
<p>In exchange for your donations, I have included some unique perks for supporters. If you donate £5, I will send you a personalised thank you email. If you donate £10, I will send you one of my astronomy pictures to download via email. If you donate £20, I will send you one of my astronomy photos printed and signed on glossy paper. Finally, if you go all the way to £100, I will give you a tour of My Dark Sky Den this winter! You should receive all of these perks by August 2019. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my full goal by the end of the 30-day campaign, I plan to keep saving to raise the balance and will let you know as soon as I've bought the kit. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've been interested in astronomy from a very young age however, it's only recently that I've got into astrophotography. </p>
<p>I'm here to inspire children and young people (especially women interested in science) to take up this fantastic, educational hobby - or take it further. I recently started a YouTube channel and a Facebook page to share my interest and adventures with my followers. I’d also love to get my local community involved by having people for visits, tutorials on how to use the telescope and stargazing sessions! My goal is to learn, teach and inspire. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I appreciate that not everyone can afford to donate financially but hope that even if you can't, you'll help me spread the word about my campaign with your friends and family, subscribe to my YouTube channel, follow me on Flickr and give my Facebook page a like. If I don't reach my target I'll keep saving on my own and exploring other possible funding sources. I certainly won't lose my interest in the world of astrophysics and will keep sharing my adventures. Without your support, it will simply take me longer to reach my goal and to buy the equipment.</p>
<p>Thank you, everyone, for checking out my campaign and for all the ongoing support! : ) </p>

<h3>An overview</h3>
<p>‘Out of the loop’ is a photography-based project which looks at waste (predominantly plastic) in our urban and rural environments. The title makes reference to waste material that has escaped ‘closed or open-loop’ recycling – waste which will neither compost or safely biodegrade into the natural environment.</p>
<p>This outcome of this project is both landscape photography, and temporary installation. It has the potential to re-engage viewers with a common problem in our consumer throw-away society, not just relevent in the UK but any other location on this blue planet of ours. </p>

<p>The objective of this final phase of this project is to <strong>emphasis</strong> the ongoing issues of waste within a local context through <strong>'scale'</strong>. </p>
<p>To do this I plan to supersize a number of waste images – <em>as shown in the gallery section of this pitch</em> – onto vinyl banners and possibly billboards, and photograph them against rural and urban backdrops.

<p>To conclude, this project will then be documented into a published limited edition book and available for exhibiting from Autumn 2012.</p>
<p>This project has the endorsement from the <strong>National Trust</strong> to shoot a temporary installation along the River Lyn in Devon, an area of outstanding beauty and variety.</p>
<h3>Mutual benefits all round</h3>

<p>At the high of the Potteries industry, the Stoke on Trent skyline was once dominated by 2000 bottle kilns. Now less than 50 remain.</p>
<p>When I started this photography project in October 2017, I wanted show that the remaining kilns are still very much part of the Potteries landscape. To document them all in their current surroundings and the way in which they interact with Stoke on Trent's modern landscape.</p>
<p>The project is a historic document of Stoke’s iconic bottle kilns in 2018.</p>

</div></div>","At the high of the Potteries industry, the Stoke on Trent skyline was once dominated by 2000 bottle kilns. Now less than 50 remain.
When I started this photography project in October 2017, I wanted show that the remaining kilns are still very much part of the Potteries landscape. To document them all in their current surroundings and the way in which they interact with Stoke on Trent's modern landscape.
The project is a historic document of Stoke’s iconic bottle kilns in 2018.

<p>Hi Indiegogo, my name is Callie Clark, I live and work
in Rome, GA, and I need your help!</p>
<p>Artistic crowdfunding has completely taken over my life--the first
thing I do in the mornings before emails or even making my coffee is check out the home page to see what amazing ideas and products you geniuses have put out there while I was sleeping. <br/></p>
<p>Checking out and backing
your mind-blowing work has been pure joy, but thanks to nerves and down right
fear, I've been putting off starting my own project. But no more, because
I<span> and several other artists have been
afforded the fantastic opportunity to take up residency in Brazil from December
13th to the 21st (my birthday!) to write, paint, and in my case--photograph the
city of Fortelza. Our generous patron, colleague, and friend will be hosting us
and taking on the burden of our quarters and food, but there are other expenses
I need your help in covering, which are listed below in as transparent detail
as possible so far, with more information to come as it's available. </span></p>
<p>While coming up with the perks, I tried to
keep in mind the kind of incentives I like and what I'm willing to pay for
them, so I hope it's a comprehensive list with something for everyone, but if
you have ideas or requests, please let me know, we're completely open.</p>
<p>Me, my family, and my friends are SO excited about this
project but we can't do it without you and would be thrilled for you to come on
board. But if it isn't your cup of tea, shoot me a message anyway so I can
check out your cool work--I'm always afraid I'll miss something! </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time today and your potential support in the
future. Talk soon and best wishes. Peace!</p>
<p></p>

<p>With
 your help and support we can all have a terrific time planning, 
executing, and enjoying the spoils of this photography project! </p>
<p>Your investments will be spent on the following necessities:</p>
<p>* Round trip airfare</p>
<p>*
 Rental fees for the photography equipment needed that can't be 
purchased while we're trying to keep overhead as low down as possible.</p>
<p>* Communications cost such as wi-fi cafes and international cell service</p>

<div>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Short Summary-</b></span></p>
<p>I am excited to tell you about The How We Are Connected Photo Exploration Project, a photography portrait series of performing artists of various cultures and the similarities they share. My goal is to create a festive geographic exhibition with an interactive visual perspective on cultural identity.</p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">My Background-</b></p>
</div>
<p>I am a visual artist with a camera working in the fields of photography and film. I have been in love with photography since the age of 7 years old. I began freelancing part-time in 2003 documenting people, culture, and the performing arts. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461634775/My-work-1_nqp32t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My Inspiration-</b></p>
<p>As a youth growing up in the Bronx, New York City- the most ethnically diverse place in the country; I became familiar with various cultures at an early age. I would literally listen out of my living room window and hear Dominican music, then hear Haitian music from the kitchen window, Hindu music from another window and Nigerian music from down the hallway in my apartment building. By the time I was old enough to attend the parties, events, and festivals, I noticed similarities, and regardless of the music playing the performing arts and dancers shared traits of movement amongst each other.</p>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My Research-</b></p>
<p>Many cultural dances are rooted to civilizations that maintain the pieces of their history and livelihood through these performances. The same is true at the roots of many ethnic groups, as dance is a common language that unites us all on some level. Outside of the typical images of tap performers and ballerinas, there are countless cultural dances that are just waiting to be discovered.</p>

The project grew into a community family and fathering development initiative. I was presented with a Seal of Acclimation from the Brooklyn Borough President. The project also developed into a Proud Poppas Family Day Outing we raised over $2000 dollars and gifted over $5000 in giveaways and prizes from sponsors and local businesses. We held the official Proud Poppas Photo Exhibition in Brooklyn in Nov 2015.</span></p>

<p>I began the HWAC-PE project in 2014 while living in New York City, since then:</p>
<p>- I have attended 25 cultural festival and functions,</p>
<p>- I have worked with 7 dance schools</p>
<p>- I have photographed over 30 participating artists.</p>
<p>- I also received several invites to attend upcoming festivals.</p>
<p>I plan to travel to 9 cultural festival events this year and early next year around the US and a few countries. The funding will assist in studio rental, travel, and lodging, image scanning, printing, marketing, and installation, as well as personnel such as a research assistant, production assistants, a copy editor and a cartographer.</p>
<p>My aim in this project is to preserve and promote culture, inspire, empower and educate people all over the world, bringing us closer. I will present the images on tall vibrant metal prints. </p>

</div></div>","Project Summary

Short Summary-
I am excited to tell you about The How We Are Connected Photo Exploration Project, a photography portrait series of performing artists of various cultures and the similarities they share. My goal is to create a festive geographic exhibition with an interactive visual perspective on cultural identity.
My Background-

I am a visual artist with a camera working in the fields of photography and film. I have been in love with photography since the age of 7 years old. I began freelancing part-time in 2003 documenting people, culture, and the performing arts. 

My Inspiration-
As a youth growing up in the Bronx, New York City- the most ethnically diverse place in the country; I became familiar with various cultures at an early age. I would literally listen out of my living room window and hear Dominican music, then hear Haitian music from the kitchen window, Hindu music from another window and Nigerian music from down the hallway in my apartment building. By the time I was old enough to attend the parties, events, and festivals, I noticed similarities, and regardless of the music playing the performing arts and dancers shared traits of movement amongst each other.
 
 



My Research-
Many cultural dances are rooted to civilizations that maintain the pieces of their history and livelihood through these performances. The same is true at the roots of many ethnic groups, as dance is a common language that unites us all on some level. Outside of the typical images of tap performers and ballerinas, there are countless cultural dances that are just waiting to be discovered.

My Experience-
This will be my 2nd publicly featured project. My previous project was called - The Proud Poppas  Photo Project. The initially started as a portrait series to advocate proactive fathers. The project grew into a community family and fathering development initiative. I was presented with a Seal of Acclimation from the Brooklyn Borough President. The project also developed into a Proud Poppas Family Day Outing we raised over $2000 dollars and gifted over $5000 in giveaways and prizes from sponsors and local businesses. We held the official Proud Poppas Photo Exhibition in Brooklyn in Nov 2015.
 
 
  
My Vision-
I will produce portrait and motion still images highlighting the similarities in attire, movement, instruments as well as an insight into the background of the artists and performances- creating a geographic portrait trail of people, costumes, sounds and movement.

My Contribution-
I began the HWAC-PE project in 2014 while living in New York City, since then:
- I have attended 25 cultural festival and functions,
- I have worked with 7 dance schools
- I have photographed over 30 participating artists.
- I also received several invites to attend upcoming festivals.
I plan to travel to 9 cultural festival events this year and early next year around the US and a few countries. The funding will assist in studio rental, travel, and lodging, image scanning, printing, marketing, and installation, as well as personnel such as a research assistant, production assistants, a copy editor and a cartographer.
My aim in this project is to preserve and promote culture, inspire, empower and educate people all over the world, bringing us closer. I will present the images on tall vibrant metal prints. 
 
 
My Risk and Challenges-Due to the lack of budget and resources, I have had photo sessions on rooftops, busy sidewalks and parks. I have also missed opportunities and photo sessions with willing artists and organizations due to lack of travel funding and studio space. I also have been working with outdated equipment with limited capabilities. 

Your Support-
I am aiming to raise $9,000. With your support, I plan to travel to 9 cultural festival events this year and early next year around the US and a few countries. The funding will assist in studio rental, travel and lodging, image scanning, printing, marketing and installation, as well as personnel such an a research assistant, production assistants, a copy editor and a cartographer. For our Indiegogo supporters, we have a number of perks and will be developing more. 

I have big plans for the future, including in-depth stories and enhanced coverage of festivals and performances. In the months ahead, I will be engaging with you about the development of the project and new artists I meet. Connect with us online by typing @THWACPEP on your favorite social media site. We hope you will join us on this exploration.

<p><b><i>We

<p>Thanks to many of you, we are sold out of
our ""Wild in Arizona: Photographing Arizona's Wildflowers"" books. <span>We continue to have requests for
copies (that we don't have) and many of you sent in great suggestions for new
locations and new flowers. </span></p>
<p>So, after considerable thought, Paul Gill and I (Colleen Miniuk-Sperry) are
working hard to come out with the <u><b>Enhanced 2nd Edition</b> </u>of our award-winning guidebook,   ""Wild in Arizona: Photographing Arizona's Wildflowers, A
Guide to When, Where, &amp; How"" (scheduled to be published in March 2015).</p>

</p>
<p><b><u>But we need your help!</u></b><b> Publishing

<p>To publish the Enhanced 2nd Edition will cost about $14,000, considering costs associated with printing, shipping, etc. (Most authors do not make money on books, and this is why they
call us ""Starving Artists!"" LOL!) </p>
<p>Paul and I<span> are requesting your help to raise $5,000 to help us cover less than half of these costs to publish the book. 
We are so passionate about helping others grow in their own photography and helping others get outside to enjoy all that Arizona has to offer.  <br/></span></p>

Earlier this year I spent the most amazing ten days in Israel on a Taglit-Birthright trip. 
My ten days in Israel completely changed
my life, in the best way possible. I feel so much more connected to the Jewish
religion, Jewish people and to G-d, than I did before I left. 
Even though my
trip had a lot of hiccups, like being stuck in the Newark airport overnight
because our flight got cancelled, to finally getting to Israel and it rained
almost every day. I can honestly say it was the best trip of my life despite
everything bad that happened.
I absolutely loved being in Israel, so much so that I am
getting ready to go back this coming September. I will be staying there for

jump-start my photography career, as well as becoming more connected to my

This beach is blessed by the image of a saint, the Virgin of Copacabana, who came from Bolivia in the seventeenth century. The saint gave not only her name but her blessing on a place which eventually became synonymous with joy, cultural diversity and natural beauty. Today, she is known as ""The Princess of the Sea,"" and the beach lies at the center of the city and the 2014 World Cup. Every day, tourists and locals alike come together to enjoy themselves, lie in the sun, relax and have a good time. In short, Copacabana is the copa — the cup — of the city of Rio.</i><br/>
</h3><div>
<div>
<h4>
<i><br/></i><i>But the notion of the beach has another side. Pleasure, unfortunately, often goes together with excess—too much sun, too much food, too much fun. Excessive consumption combined with a sedentary lifestyle has brought on health problems in Brazil, particularly obesity.  On average, Brazilians eat 177 pounds of meat per year and approximately 48% of the population is overweight. Despite our country's reputed love for movement (in dance and in futebol), we are slowing down.<br/></i><i>So, ""Copa na Copa,"" takes a look at the Copacabana in a different light. Rather than seeing it as a tourist mecca, these pictures present one of the most traditional neighborhoods of the city (its population is 30% elderly). My pictures show the beach in an ironic and amusing way, portraying its beauty in a way not usually shown on TV. But I also want to reflect on the way Brazilians are living their lives today. How long can the party go on?  </i>

<div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">""Copa na Copa"" started as a joke, a form of protest to show a different Copacabana, a side of consumption and quite typical excesses to Brazilians. But also show that the traditional neighbourhood hosts the largest number of elderly in Brazil and is considered the ""oldest"" neighbourhood in the country. With Copa na Copa, I wanted to show that the Brazil's most famous beach has another kind of beauty, not the one shown normally. </span><br/></p>
<p>The project ""Copa na Copa"" grew during the World Cup 2014 and has been gaining prominence in Instagram, reaching the cover of renowned LensCulture site. </p>
<p><b>With the material done during the games, and an invitation to join the NY Art Book Fair 2014 to be held at MoMA PS1 during days 26-28 of September, I am asking for help to fund the initial print of 10 books, 50 pages, 43 pictures 7x7 inches, to be printed on the Blurb platform.  </b></p>
<p>The book will be printed on the best paper, the ProLine Pearl Photo, to enhance the colors and the joy of the photos. I choose to use a Softcover, first because I want to reduce the production costs, and second because this will give the book a look of Rio magazine of the 70s, an aesthetic that pleases me greatly.</p>
<p>My initial idea is to print only 10 books to be sold on the NY Art Book Fair 2014, but this number can increase if I fund more than $500. Every extra $50 will be used to print an extra book.</p>

Copacabana. This beach is blessed by the image of a saint, the Virgin of Copacabana, who came from Bolivia in the seventeenth century. The saint gave not only her name but her blessing on a place which eventually became synonymous with joy, cultural diversity and natural beauty. Today, she is known as ""The Princess of the Sea,"" and the beach lies at the center of the city and the 2014 World Cup. Every day, tourists and locals alike come together to enjoy themselves, lie in the sun, relax and have a good time. In short, Copacabana is the copa — the cup — of the city of Rio.



But the notion of the beach has another side. Pleasure, unfortunately, often goes together with excess—too much sun, too much food, too much fun. Excessive consumption combined with a sedentary lifestyle has brought on health problems in Brazil, particularly obesity.  On average, Brazilians eat 177 pounds of meat per year and approximately 48% of the population is overweight. Despite our country's reputed love for movement (in dance and in futebol), we are slowing down.So, ""Copa na Copa,"" takes a look at the Copacabana in a different light. Rather than seeing it as a tourist mecca, these pictures present one of the most traditional neighborhoods of the city (its population is 30% elderly). My pictures show the beach in an ironic and amusing way, portraying its beauty in a way not usually shown on TV. But I also want to reflect on the way Brazilians are living their lives today. How long can the party go on?  


—Vitor Sá, with interpretation by Alexander Strecker



""Copa na Copa"" started as a joke, a form of protest to show a different Copacabana, a side of consumption and quite typical excesses to Brazilians. But also show that the traditional neighbourhood hosts the largest number of elderly in Brazil and is considered the ""oldest"" neighbourhood in the country. With Copa na Copa, I wanted to show that the Brazil's most famous beach has another kind of beauty, not the one shown normally. 
The project ""Copa na Copa"" grew during the World Cup 2014 and has been gaining prominence in Instagram, reaching the cover of renowned LensCulture site. 
With the material done during the games, and an invitation to join the NY Art Book Fair 2014 to be held at MoMA PS1 during days 26-28 of September, I am asking for help to fund the initial print of 10 books, 50 pages, 43 pictures 7x7 inches, to be printed on the Blurb platform.  
The book will be printed on the best paper, the ProLine Pearl Photo, to enhance the colors and the joy of the photos. I choose to use a Softcover, first because I want to reduce the production costs, and second because this will give the book a look of Rio magazine of the 70s, an aesthetic that pleases me greatly.
My initial idea is to print only 10 books to be sold on the NY Art Book Fair 2014, but this number can increase if I fund more than $500. Every extra $50 will be used to print an extra book.

And the more likely that with proceeds from book sales we will be able to support the wonderful initiatives and programs designed to help local populations in the tsunami regions learn about tidal surges and tsunamis and plan routes of escape as well as early warning systems.</p>

Tuesday, December 2, 2014.
4:04 pm Pacific Standard Time.
Right here on Indiegogo.
On December 2, #GivingTuesday, we received an extraordinary swell of support and went from 19% to 103% funded in less than 24 hours. Dan and I were stunned, thrilled, humbled. But most of all, grateful—grateful because the promise we made to the people Dan photographed ten years ago can now be fulfilled.
Because of all of you.
THANK YOU.
Here is the project web page, enjoy!Stretch Goals


We have set the following next-phase goals for this project to realize our long-term mission:

POSTCARDS: $750 to print a set of 5,000 5x7 postcards with inspirational captions. We'll print several different images from the book, for a total of 5,000 postcards to be distributed at presentations and workshops for all ages on survival and resilience. Postcards double as exercise tools as participants can write notes on the back.


SCREENSAVER: $250 to put together a digital package of images with inspirational quotes (and another version with captions from the book) you can upload to your desktop and use as a screensaver.



PRESENTATIONS IN SCHOOLS: $2500 to put together a first series of workshops and presentations on the subjects of strength, survival and resilience in the face of trauma and/or disaster, whether man- or nature-made, and conduct these events at local Bay Area high schools and colleges. We are working with the California Health Medical Reserve Corps on this.





The Tsunami


Sunday, December 26, 2004.
00:58:53 am Coordinated Universal Time.
160 km off the west coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia.
The world sleeps blissfully after the holidays. A 9.1 earthquake suddenly explodes deep beneath the Indian Ocean, setting off a series of tsunamis that swallow the shores of 11 countries and rip $9.9 billion in damages. Over quarter of a million people lose their lives; hundreds of thousands are left injured, homeless, or destitute.
That was the Indian Ocean Tsunami. 
Dan and I wanted to do something to make sure the world never forgets.
The Book
My name is Birgitte Rasine. I'm an author and producer based in Northern California. In January 2005, I approached ICLEI, a non profit working with local governments all over the world on sustainability, with the idea of a photography book to celebrate resilience, rejuvenation, and rebuilding in the aftermath of the tsunami, not death and destruction that so much of the mainstream media was focusing on. 
ICLEI loved the idea and gave us a travel grant; in March 2005 I sent photographer Dan Root to India and Thailand, the two countries where ICLEI had support personnel. He came back with hundreds of stunning photographs—images as evocative and meaningful today as they were the moment he took them. 
After Dan's trip, we ran into a few roadblocks that forced us to table the book idea.  So we built a website with what was left from the initial funds—the site is still up to this day.
But Dan and I never gave up hope that one day, this book we intended to produce, this promise we made to the people Dan encountered in the tsunami-affected areas, would become a reality.  
You can now hold that reality in your hands.  




With the sea changes taking place in the publishing sector, we no longer need a major publisher to give us the green light for this book. We have our own imprint, LUCITÀ Publishing, which has already released a number of titles.  
TSUNAMI: IMAGES OF RESILIENCE is a gorgeous full-color hardcover book of Dan's most striking and memorable images from India and Thailand. You can see some of the images from the book in the ""Gallery"" tab above.
We're also producing a digital version of the book—an eBook for your iPad, Kindle, Nook, or Kobo eReader.  

The print book is 112 pages, 10x8 landscape format.  The interior of the book will be printed in luscious four colors on 80lb matte paper.

The book layout is simple yet elegant:


Five sections of photographs: After the Wave, Water, Rebuild, Home, and Family. Poetic captions and quotes from Dan's original field notes accompany the images.

Personal statements by Dan and Birgitte 
Caption index that provides details about each image and where it was taken
A list of the international aid organizations active on the ground in the months following the tsunami








The Prints
What is a book without its best images printed in fine archival format, adorning the walls of your home? We have selected ten of the most powerful images from the book and are making them available as fine prints. The Gallery tab above showcases these ten prints (plus a few more images from the book).

The selected photographs will be printed with archival inks on Hahnemühle Fine Art Pearl 285gsm 40 mil paper and will be signed by the photographer, Dan Root. Available in two sizes, 8'' x 12'' and 16'' x 24''.

Here's one of our favorites, its light and texture reminiscent of Rembrandt: ""Making Poori.""






The Team

Dan Root is a Portland, Oregon-based photographer and former photojournalist who has shot for Nike, adidas, Manchester United, the Oregon Food Bank and many other companies and organizations. When he's color balanced too many images at a stretch he goes off fishing. See www.drootphoto.com.
Birgitte Rasine is a literary author, publisher, producer, and entrepreneur based in Silicon Valley. A former journalist for the Hollywood film industry, she is a member of various publishing organizations. Her idea of a great vacation is rubbing piranhas' bellies and swimming in ancient Mayan canals in Latin America. See www.birgitterasine.com.
Luba Ortoleva is a classically trained artist and designer originally from the Czech Republic based near New York. She's a true Renaissance woman—print, web, animation, and actual art drawn by hand, she can do it all. When threatened by a lazy Sunday, she can whip up a mean homemade crêpe.

Andrea Jiménez Guerrero is a designer based in Bogotá, Colombia. In addition to her work on this book, she’s also the head of design at a startup providing graphic, web and digital design services.  When she’s not at her desk, she loves to dance and chase new musical rhythms.
Our publishing assistant Amanda Broughton is a budding photographer in her own right; on this project she's supporting us with research and marketing & sales outreach. On top of it all she's incredible with kids.


Special thanks to Balanza (www.balanza.de), an amazing band from Germany that composed the music used in the video you've just seen, and to Chris Hornbecker, the man behind the camera. (Haven't watched it yet? Go back up to the top of the page!)







Use of Funds



Dan and I have put in countless hours of our time and resources combing through all of the images from his trip ten years ago, all over again; optimizing and color balancing them; working with the designers to lay out the book; writing the text and supplemental materials. And shooting the video you see at the top of this page.


In short, for us this is a labor of love.  What we do need your help and support on is funding the physical printed copies and the eBook version of TSUNAMI: IMAGES OF RESILIENCE.  We seek to raise an initial $9,006 in funding, which will enable us to print and store 1,000 copies and produce the eBook.
Here's how it breaks down: 


Four-color printing (1K copies): $7,006

Fulfillment, storage, and order processing fees: $500 
Image optimization for CMYK and RGB colorspace, digital production, conversion, & beta testing: $1,500

The funds are going not to us individually but to LUCITÀ Publishing, the publisher of TSUNAMI: IMAGES OF RESILIENCE and the publishing arm of LUCITÀ Inc., a company that has been in business since 1999.
#GivingTuesday update:
We have reached our initial funding goal of $9,006. Upon discussion with some of our collaborators, we have decided that instead of simply printing more books, we are going to devote our stretch goals to producing other types of products with these images that we can employ in workshops, conferences and other events that engage participants in discussion on survival, strength, and resilience (see Stretch Goals above).
However, our original plan for the one thousand copies of the book still remains:
The net profits from book sales will be utilized to donate and distribute the books to schools, libraries, cultural institutions, trauma prevention centers, disaster preparedness programs and other similar entities and initiatives, including in India and Thailand where the images were taken. 








It's Never About Just a Book
We may understand the words and numbers that describe the destruction caused by the tsunami, but we may not easily resonate with those words and numbers.
But when we look at a single image, an image of a human being—a man, a woman, a child—who survived the Tsunami, we can instantly relate. We can feel that person’s pain, that person’s loss as strongly as we feel his or her courage, strength, resilience, and hope for a new future.This is why this book is a book of images and not words or numbers.


And because we believe in the power of the image to reach far beyond its source, its place of origin, we're working with selected partner organizations and groups to harness these images to raise funds for disaster preparedness programs in the regions impacted by the Tsunami on the one hand, and on the other, to inspire and support survivors of other disasters and traumatic events not related to the Tsunami. This collaboration may result in photography exhibits, seminars, presentations, fundraisers, and other types of events and initiatives.
Please see our campaign updates for more information on the development of these efforts.











Risks & Challenges
We've waited ten years to produce this book; we're not going to let anything stop us. But we need your help to print those first one thousand copies and produce the eBook. 
We are no spring chickens when it comes to publishing—Birgitte is one mean book producer and Dan leaves entire busloads of photographers in the dust when it comes to image optimization and color balance (not to mention how awesome his images are in the first place). We're blessed with two incredible designers, and a community of friends, colleagues, and more friends who believe in this project and the power of these images as passionately as we do. If not more so.
We have already received the first hardproof of the book and it's gorgeous.  In other words, the design and layout are done and the files are at the printer's, ready to be transformed into living breathing books.
So, there's little to zero chance of us not being able to deliver—barring a stampede of ravenous chihuahuas busting down our printer's doors in the middle of the night (but they have insurance against that. We think.).
Ditto for the fine archival print facility we have selected—they're a shop in Portland, Oregon that Dan has worked with in the past, so there's an established relationship there.
As far as the eBook is concerned, we manage the entire process from start to finish, beta test on multiple devices, and upload our own files so we have total control over the final product. Those of you who've read our other titles in eBook format know the quality of our work.
Now that we have secured funding for the one thousand copies we set out to print, we are turning our attention to our stretch goals. So we STILL need your support, but this time it's to help us and our collaborators take this project to the next level. The more support we have, the more products and uses we can produce with these images, and the more hands can touch these pages that have waited ten years to be produced. And the more likely that with proceeds from book sales we will be able to support the wonderful initiatives and programs designed to help local populations in the tsunami regions learn about tidal surges and tsunamis and plan routes of escape as well as early warning systems.

<p><strong><em>Stories and Slides</em></strong></p>
<p>Focusing on the qualities of selflessness central to Guanyin, we explore her incarnation as the folk lengend Miao-shan, and compare her to the Handless Maiden in western tales.  Pertinent to our lives today, these stories ask a soul-searching question: what is sacrifice and what is unconditional love? </p>
<p>Miao-shan is adolescent girl. As an adult figure, Guanyin has mastered the teachings of the Buddha. She wears an Eternal Buddha at her forehead and gestures with her left hand in a teaching mudra.  Like Sophia, she a feminine representation of great wisdom.</p>
<p>In sculptures and paintings we see Guanyin confidently standing in the back of a lion, carp, turtle or horse. Sometimes she is standing on the back of a dragon skimming the ocean waves.  Her all-knowing faith profoundly connects her to the natural environment.  How does she speak to our modern world?</p>
<p><strong><em>Contemplations</em></strong></p>
<p>The contemplations deepen our experience and understanding.  To set the tone a brief introduction and short periods of sitting and walking meditation will be offered. </p>
<p>During the contemplations, one might simply reflect on a quote or image. A phrase is repeated to see what arises in the mind. An icon is simply appreciated or one may notice what other images, feelings or insights are evoked. </p>

As this went a lot faster than I ever anticipated, I have some stretch goals!  Keep reading to see them! Please don't stop donating!!  Thank you!!This November, there will be an exhibit at the Botanical Gardens of Buenos Aires of my series of photos of the Jacaranda trees that grace the streets, plazas and parks of Buenos Aires. This campaign will raise funds to pay for this exhibit and be a way for my extended family, friends, and maybe even some fans of my work to participate in this exhibit from both near and afar with both financial and emotional support. My name is Beatrice Murch and I am a photographer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Originally from the USA and the UK, I immigrated to Argentina in 2006 and immediately fell in love with the beauty of the trees of Buenos Aires.What is Needed & What you GetThe exhibit will cost at least $1500. This total includes printing and mounting costs of the twelve photos, all promotional materials, and opening party supplies. I am asking for $3000 to cover the costs of the perks that will be given out to supporters and IndieGoGo’s cut. For example, my photo book “Seasons of Buenos Aires” printed by blurb.com costs $80 to print and ship. This is why this perk is the most expensive and for supporters who contribute $200.
Seasons of Buenos Aires $200 ($80 is my cost)
Canvas Prints are $125 ($70)
Jigsaw Puzzles are $100 ($45)
2018 Calendars are $75 ($35)
Dozen Photo Cards are $50 ($30)
8x10” Print is $25 ($10)
High Res Print $15
Twitter Thank you $10
The ImpactJardín Botánico de Buenos Aires hosts monthly art exhibits in the prominent exhibit hall in the center of the garden. This beautiful brick building was the former home of the famed landscape artist Carlos Thays who is responsible for the design of most of the plazas and parks in Buenos Aires. A selection of my Tipa tree photographs was chosen for an exhibit in 2011, and I am thrilled to be invited back for this show of my Jacaranda tree photographs while the Jacarandas are in bloom in Buenos Aires. This exhibit will showcase the beauty that is the natural greenery that can be found on the streets and the plazas of Buenos Aires. It will help promote tourism to the city, create a positive experience, and bring a greater audience to my body of work.Risks & ChallengesThough I have chosen the photographs for this new exhibit, the logistics are still to be worked out and executed. Having had a show in this specific location before and worked with the administrators, I know the steps, and am better organized and prepared this go round. That being said, this is Argentina and chaos has a way of infecting itself into projects. This is why I am starting early with the planning and have received quotes and timetables to get the photos printed and mounted, the promotional materials made, and the press release written and waiting to be sent to generate excitement about the show.  If the fundraising goal is not reached, the promised rewards of course will be shipped. The remaining costs of the exhibit will be born by myself. The show must go on!!Stretch GoalsWe made the first stretch goal of $5,000 - Thank you so much!!  The following improvements to the exhibition will be made:
The prints will be of higher quality than first imagined.
The opening reception party will get a bit of an upgrade. :)
A videographer will be on hand to capture the event to show all my amazing supporters what they created.

<h3>Who</h3>
<p>I am a photographer who has finally found the subject matter that makes my heart the happiest. Over the last few years, I have self published several documentary style books, chronicling everything from carnival workers to wise words from our elders. In more recent years, I have also been working on concept photography, and when I found that dealing with my feelings about current social and political events by being able to capture my perception of them in images was therapeutic, I had a new mission.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>This ten image series, was compiled to start a conversation. I want us to be able to laugh at ourselves, to be shocked, and maybe to even feel a bit uncomfortable with what is happening in these images, as it is a reflection of what is happening directly around us. I knew that I wanted to do something different with this project, and to make the biggest impact I have to date and because I have a limited amount of images in this series I plan on printing them to an awesome 40"" x 60"". I want every detail, pore, twig, and wrinkle - to have an impact on the viewer standing in front of it.</p>
<p>I have arranged the printing with a local print company, as well as taken into consideration the cost of transportation / cases for prints of this size. I am reaching out to small businesses and friends for the idea of sponsorship per canvas, but am also asking for anyone interested to donate towards the final goal. Whether you would like to sponsor an entire print, or secure a book of the prints, or just throw in a 'good luck' buck - I am forever grateful and humbled by whatever you would like to contribute. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>I want you to walk into a art show where these canvases are on display, and I want you to really see the image. The faces, the places, each piece of costume, each element of the story, and although I don't expect you to feel like a changed person, I hope that I can make you want to talk about current events, or maybe even appreciate art and it's various outlets a little bit more.  All of my projects have always been to help the world see itself a little better. This project has opened up so many new visions for my future endeavors, and I truly feel like I have found my stride. With your donation, you are supporting a local artist, and although that is only a small part of the 'why' of this project, the impact will be felt by how we see ourselves and want to change if only a little - by seeing our place in the stories these images tell. Of course, art is subjective. I know what I want you to see, but if you only take away the fact that art and self-expression is important, especially today in the fight for change, then I've done what I set out to do.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>Any donation towards this project will help! All funds gathered will be put towards</p>
<p>-  (10) 40"" x  60""  Wrapped Canvas Prints</p>
<p>-  Hardcover Books of the series, ""Gaudy"" - A Social Commentary Series 2018</p>
<p>-  Fees, Expenses Exhibits / Gallery Costs</p>
<p>Whether you are all in to sponsor an entire print, want a book or just to throw in anything you can to help - you are making a huge difference! Any sales of the prints after the exhibits in 2018 will be given to charitable organizations which I will have a compiled list of before the project is over.</p>

Cooper began his successful career as a fashion photographer for <i>British Vogue</i> capturing the vibrant energy of the Swinging Sixties in London. In 1964, through the art dealer Robert Fraser, Cooper became immersed in the art and music scene and photographed many leading figures in music, art, fashion, and literature, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Andy Warhol, Cecil Beaton, Twiggy, Jean Genet, and Allen Ginsberg among many others. Cooper's close association with the Rolling Stones, resulted in his largest body of photographic work. As a trusted friend, Cooper was right there with them, camera in hand, capturing every moment, at home, at play, and in the studio. In 1967, Cooper photographed two of the most legendary rock and roll covers of all time, The Beatles’ <i>Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, and The Rolling Stones’ <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request.</i> In 1973, Cooper took his own life leaving behind an unparalleled photographic legacy that is cared for by his son Adam. </p><p><strong>We are pleased to offer the first ever Brian Jones photo book to be published as a deluxe limited edition. </strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562085226/rz1rptnymedlpbzqh8rf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Rolling Stones: Their Satanic Majesties Request &amp; The Beatles: Sgt.

<h3><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p><i><strong>I’VE ALWAYS BEEN A COWBOY IN MY HEART​<i> </i></strong> </i>is my outsider's observations of the weird happenstances that present itself on the great American road trip, as seen through the wide eyes of a Scotsman. After relocating from my native homeland of Scotland in the 90's, I have now spent over half my life in Texas. This 12-year project chronicles my fascination with everyday occurrences in the social landscape and explores the spaces between clarity and imperfection, composing a personal slice of America. </p>
<p>When put into a photographic context, the aesthetics convey recurring visions of scrutiny, Scottish humor, absurdity and empathy, transforming the most banal scenarios into a nostalgic connection to myself and my background.</p>
<p>It has always been my dream to publish this project as a photobook, and  this year I have teamed up with with <a href=""http://www.yoffypress.com/cowboy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yoffy Press</a>, a kick-ass publisher in Atlanta, GA.</p>
<p>Your kind donations, help and good vibes toward the production of this photobook will make you part of a weird journey with me through the States and keeping physical media alive.</p>

THE PROJECT
I’VE ALWAYS BEEN A COWBOY IN MY HEART​  is my outsider's observations of the weird happenstances that present itself on the great American road trip, as seen through the wide eyes of a Scotsman. After relocating from my native homeland of Scotland in the 90's, I have now spent over half my life in Texas. This 12-year project chronicles my fascination with everyday occurrences in the social landscape and explores the spaces between clarity and imperfection, composing a personal slice of America. 
When put into a photographic context, the aesthetics convey recurring visions of scrutiny, Scottish humor, absurdity and empathy, transforming the most banal scenarios into a nostalgic connection to myself and my background.
It has always been my dream to publish this project as a photobook, and  this year I have teamed up with with Yoffy Press, a kick-ass publisher in Atlanta, GA.
Your kind donations, help and good vibes toward the production of this photobook will make you part of a weird journey with me through the States and keeping physical media alive.

<p>With a successful first few weeks, I've decided that it's time to formally launch the project's crowdfunding campaign here on Indiegogo. <br/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">WHY I'M UNDERTAKING THIS PROJECT</span></p>
<p>Despite technology making the world a smaller place, it has also created an information overload where incredible, individual human stories from everyday people around the world are never heard or too often lost. </p>
<p>Captured Earth aims to find and retell some of these stories; stories which also promise to help showcase and remind us about the raw elements of humanity that exist inside every one of us, no matter our age, wealth, sex, religion, race or where we live. </p>
<p>The photographic stories captured from the journey can be followed online at <a href=""http://www.capturedearth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CapturedEarth.com</a> and on the project's social media pages. Next year a beautiful coffee table book will be published containing a curated set of the stories captured.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>A unique part of the project is that it's crowdsourced, meaning you have input and can influence how it grows and develops! For example, <i>you</i> decide where in the world the project travels to capture these photographic stories of humanity. Since you help decide how it develops, let's call it <i>our</i> project :). </p>
<p>Since commencing the journey six weeks ago, the project's followers have already sent me to several different locations to capture stories. These locations were determined by an interactive poll at <a href=""http://www.capturedearth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CapturedEarth.com</a>. The result from the most recent poll has brought me to Nepal, where I'm currently gathering and publishing some incredible stories from the amazing people here.</p>
<p>The next destination depends on the result of the newest poll on the project's website. Where would you like me to capture stories next? <br/></p>

</div>
</div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Undertaking an ambitious global project like Captured Earth is difficult without outside support; support which is critical for the continuation and growth of the project.</p>
<p>After careful consideration and budgeting for the likely expenses involved, I've set a fundraising target of US$12,000. I believe this is how much I would need to allow me to reach my goal of capturing 1,000 photographic stories of humanity from people around the world. Essentially, the more raised, the longer the project can continue and the more stories I can capture and showcase to you. </p>
<p><br/><span style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px;""><b>WHAT THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR</b></span></p></span></div><div>
<p>The big ticket items such as flights, travel visas, insurance and the various costs involved in running a website and keeping my camera equipment maintained all add up to a scary sum.</p>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will help with all these expenses as well as the day-to-day costs that enable me to survive, capture stories and connect to the online world so I can continue to bring you the stories through the rest of 2014 and into 2015.</p>
<p>Once the goal of capturing 1,000 stories is achieved (early-mid 2015) I will return to New Zealand and start work on the Captured Earth coffee table book, to be published later next year.</p>

A global photography project you can influence

 

 Hello! I'm Tom, a New Zealander currently far from home. Six weeks ago I launched a photography project called Captured Earth, a project to capture and showcase amazing, sad, happy, funny, deep and sometimes brutally honest photographic stories of humanity from people around the world. 
With a successful first few weeks, I've decided that it's time to formally launch the project's crowdfunding campaign here on Indiegogo. 
WHY I'M UNDERTAKING THIS PROJECT
Despite technology making the world a smaller place, it has also created an information overload where incredible, individual human stories from everyday people around the world are never heard or too often lost. 
Captured Earth aims to find and retell some of these stories; stories which also promise to help showcase and remind us about the raw elements of humanity that exist inside every one of us, no matter our age, wealth, sex, religion, race or where we live. 
The photographic stories captured from the journey can be followed online at CapturedEarth.com and on the project's social media pages. Next year a beautiful coffee table book will be published containing a curated set of the stories captured.
>> More about Tom and the story behind Captured Earth
THIS IS OUR PROJECT. YOU CAN BE INVOLVED!


A unique part of the project is that it's crowdsourced, meaning you have input and can influence how it grows and develops! For example, you decide where in the world the project travels to capture these photographic stories of humanity. Since you help decide how it develops, let's call it our project :). 
Since commencing the journey six weeks ago, the project's followers have already sent me to several different locations to capture stories. These locations were determined by an interactive poll at CapturedEarth.com. The result from the most recent poll has brought me to Nepal, where I'm currently gathering and publishing some incredible stories from the amazing people here.
The next destination depends on the result of the newest poll on the project's website. Where would you like me to capture stories next? 






Feel free to head over to CapturedEarth.com and have a browse of the stories captured from the journey so far! New stories are usually added on a daily basis.

What does being invited to help create the Captured Earth coffee table book involve?

WHAT ARE SUPPORTER STORIES?

As you've hopefully seen on CapturedEarth.com, I've managed to capture some incredible stories from people in the locations I've visited. That said, I know there're so many people around the world with equally incredible stories that I'll never have the opportunity to meet.

If you know someone with an incredible story you think should be captured and shared with the world, I will interview them (via email, Skype or phone call), capture their story and publish it on CapturedEarth.com and the project's social media pages, just like I have with all the other stories captured so far. The story will also feature in the Captured Earth coffee table book in 2015. 

The person whose story is told could be a family member, a friend, an inspirational community leader, a volunteer, the shopkeeper down the road, the postman or even yourself! At the end of the day, everyone has a story of some sort to tell. Supporter Stories allows this story to be captured, published and then be seen and appreciated by thousands of people around the world. Having the story also published in the Captured Earth coffee table book would allow the story to live on for many years to come.


How will you capture them and will you need a photo to go with the story?
I will interview the subject just like I do any of the other people I capture stories from, although instead of interviewing in person I shall be asking the questions by email, Skype or phone call. I'll then write up a story based on the interview and send it to you/the subject to make sure you're happy with it before it's published.
I will also require a photo of the person to be posted with the story. All photo credit will of course be given to the person who took the picture.

WHAT ARE THE BRONZE, SILVER & GOLD SPONSORSHIP PACKAGES?

These perks are aimed at companies and organisations wishing to support the project. Individuals are welcome to claim them as well if they wish.
As well as exposure of the company's logo and links through the Captured Earth website, social media pages and in the Captured Earth coffee table book, each of these packages also include a number ofSupporters Stories. These can be given out to people of your choosing who you think should have their story told to the world. Signed copies of the Captured Earth coffee table book will be sent out to you when published later in 2015. See FAQs below for more details regarding exposure your company will receive.
What sort of exposure will my company/organisation receive?
You will have your logo, company name and links published on the home page at CapturedEarth.com, across several pages on the site and of course be featured heavily on the Supporters Wall as a bronze/silver/gold sponsor of the project. 
You'll also be listed on the project's social media pages and receive exposure in the Captured Earth coffee table book when it is published later in 2015.
To discuss sponsorship or for more information, please feel free to contact me.

WHAT DOES BEING INVITED TO HELP CREATE THE CAPTURED EARTH COFFEE TABLE BOOK INVOLVE? 
To link in with the crowdsourced theme of the project, I'll be putting up interactive polls and lists on CapturedEarth.com in 2015 where you can choose what photographic stories and other content should go into the coffee table book.

As a supporter you will be sent an special invitation to take part in this. Come help make a beautiful coffee table book!

<h2>Hello and Welcome.</h2>
<p>A few years ago, at a charming bakery in Lexington, Kentucky, I met Rosie Moosnick. I was instantly drawn to her eclectic style and her attractive personality. Before long, Rosie asked me to photograph the people she had interviewed for her second book, ""Arab and Jewish Women in Kentucky, Stories of Accommodation and Audacity."" (<a href=""http://ethnickentuckian.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ethnickentuckian.com/</a>) This collaboration was the beginning of our beautiful friendship.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Rosie encouraged me to come listen to Diane Cornelius talk about her work that intertwines community service with her business. The decision to attend this lecture has led me to this very opportunity to travel to Haiti. Diane is the owner of Ruth's Bridal, a local bridal boutique in Lexington, Kentucky (<a href=""http://www.ruthsbridalshop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ruthsbridalshop.com/</a>). Three years ago, Diane began a journey that has since changed her life. She helps in donating the gift of marriage to Haitian couples that have been living in a common law marriage for years. (<a href=""http://ruthsbridalshop.com/brides-helping-brides/brides-helping-brides-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ruthsbridalshop.com/brides-helping-brides/brides-helping-brides-2/</a>) The sacrament of marriage will allow these couples, more specifically women, to be accepted in society and receive inheritance if their loved one should pass.  Once married, younger women will be treated with respect and middle-aged women will now be called Madame. By purchasing the rings, marriage license, and even dressing the bride and groom, Diane has made a huge impact on the people of North West Haiti.</p>
<p>I, too, want to make an impact on these people's lives with my talent. Most Haitian families are not graced with the everyday luxury of photographs like you and I are so accustomed to and can easily afford.  The average income in Northwest Haiti, specifically in St. Louis du Nord, is no more than $2.00 per day and it is rare for the opportunity of work to present itself. Feeding and giving shelter to their children is the woman’s first priority and in most cases, there is no money left for a wedding.</p>

<p>This campaign is intended to help me travel, document, and then print photographs for twenty couples that will be marrying at the end of March. I want to give the gift of photographs to these couples so they can cherish their wedding memories for a lifetime—photographs that can be passed down to their children and grandchildren. With every donation given in support of this campaign, it will help a family receive a collection of photographs from their wedding day. The more funds raised, the more lavish of a gift we can give them, for example, larger prints and a wedding album. I have been photographing American weddings for eight years. These years, I believe, have been in preparation for this very trip. If you believe in my campaign, or in me, please donate now.</p>

While I was studying abroad for 10 months in Ghana on a US State Department scholarship, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with Tremendous Entertainment in producing two shows that aired on the Travel Channel.

<br/>My first study abroad experience took place five years ago in South Korea on a scholarship from the Naples Council on World Affairs. Since then, I have not looked back; this summer will be my fourth experience studying abroad. This time, I will be attending a university in Taiwan on a Taiwan-USA scholarship. As always, when I study abroad this summer, I will maintain my travel, food, and culture blog, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/photography-prints-by-avery-segal/x/www.averysegal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.averysegal.com</a>.<div></div>

<p>My goal is to take a step up in photography by purchasing the Canon 6D.  My Canon T3I has taken me far, but is designed as an entry-level DSLR.  A mid-level full-frame camera like the 6D is essential for capturing low-light and high-dynamic range photos. With the new camera, I plan to start a daily photoblog of my summer travels on my website.</p>

<p>I believe that traveling responsibly has the ability to make a difference in the way no other thing can. World politics and international relations are often simplified to one country being good, and another bad.

</div></div>","Bio

Hi everyone! My name is Avery and I am a third year student at the University of Florida studying Chinese and History. While I was studying abroad for 10 months in Ghana on a US State Department scholarship, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with Tremendous Entertainment in producing two shows that aired on the Travel Channel. After returning home I bought my first DSLR camera, and have been taking photos ever since.
My first study abroad experience took place five years ago in South Korea on a scholarship from the Naples Council on World Affairs. Since then, I have not looked back; this summer will be my fourth experience studying abroad. This time, I will be attending a university in Taiwan on a Taiwan-USA scholarship. As always, when I study abroad this summer, I will maintain my travel, food, and culture blog, www.averysegal.com.



My Goal:
My goal is to take a step up in photography by purchasing the Canon 6D.  My Canon T3I has taken me far, but is designed as an entry-level DSLR.  A mid-level full-frame camera like the 6D is essential for capturing low-light and high-dynamic range photos. With the new camera, I plan to start a daily photoblog of my summer travels on my website.
Even the smallest amount helps. The lowest perk costs less than a cup of coffee, and would be deeply appreciated. The perks range from thank you notes to postcards and prints. All profits will go towards my next camera.
I'm not purely asking for donations, but am instead looking to sell my photographs. I've printed several canvas and prints over the past six months, and love the feeling of having art hanging on walls..







How Do I Travel?
I believe that traveling responsibly has the ability to make a difference in the way no other thing can. World politics and international relations are often simplified to one country being good, and another bad. Oftentimes, we only hear the negatives about the outside world.  Traveling allows us to see the individuals -  to meet and understand the people of the world. In this manner, I often discover that we are more similar than people often think.
My favorite photography subjects include food, landscapes, and people. However, I have learned that indiscriminately taking photos of people abroad often leads to  a zoo mentality. I've been asked, ""Why do you want to take my photo?"" Rather, I've found that the best photos I've taken are of my friends and acquaintances abroad whom I've gotten to know, and received permission to take their photo.  Afterwards  I make a point of taking their email or address to eventually send the photos taken.

Photographer Johany Jutras will hit the road alone on July 20th, and she will
make a stop at each of the 9 CFL cities: Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton,
Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. During this journey she will
spend about 6-8 days in each city, and immerse herself with the fans of the
local CFL team, letting her capture the essence of the culture and the love of
the fans for their team. A social media campaign is going to be conducted along
the journey. Fans and supporters will be able to follow her through her many
social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat) as well as on an
online blog that she will update every 3-4 days with stories, photos and
videos. </span>

(and a lot of photos)





GOAL: Photographer Johany Jutras is going to embark on a roadtrip
across the beautiful Canadian countryside,
completing the first ever documented CFL roadtrip. Along that amazing journey,
she will capture - through her lens - each CFL city's unique culture and
history, finally telling you the story of our Canadian Football passion,
with the end result being a premium 112-page long photobook. 



ABOUT THE ROADTRIP: The
roadtrip is going to be a 70-75 day long journey travelling through Canada.
Photographer Johany Jutras will hit the road alone on July 20th, and she will
make a stop at each of the 9 CFL cities: Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton,
Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. During this journey she will
spend about 6-8 days in each city, and immerse herself with the fans of the
local CFL team, letting her capture the essence of the culture and the love of
the fans for their team. A social media campaign is going to be conducted along
the journey. Fans and supporters will be able to follow her through her many
social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat) as well as on an
online blog that she will update every 3-4 days with stories, photos and
videos.

<p>
</p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">An ambitious project to photograph those impacted by the proposed Energy East pipeline.</span></h3>
<p>In a few weeks I will be starting out on a long journey to follow the route of the proposed Energy East pipeline from Hardistry, Alberta to St.John, New Brunswick in Canada. I will use photography to create portraits and multimedia pieces that put a human face on this pipeline. Through this work I hope to demonstrate the strength of Canadians and First Nations, what we value and how this project will have far reaching implications.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The end goal of this project is a photography exhibit that will help elevate the conversation in Canada around pipelines and climate change. Several leading environmental NGOs in Canada are already planning how to incorporate this exhibit into their work. </span></h3>
<p>I was born in Canada and lived for many years in the Netherlands. I believe in the role of art and photography to create a thriving world. Throughout my career I have used photography to focus on issues related to our rapidly changing climate. I have worked for Canadian Geographic, National Geographic Traveler and a variety of NGOs. My work can be found at <a href=""vanwaardenphoto.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vanwaardenphoto.com</a>.</p>

<h3>About Energy East</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">TransCanada, the same company behind the Keystone XL pipeline, is proposing another pipeline but this time across Canada. If approved, Energy East would transport 1.1 million barrels of diluted bitumen a day from the oil sands of Alberta to St. John. It would cross hundreds of waterways and drinking water supplies and would be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions that would equal 7 million new
cars on the road. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Is this the future we want?</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With your support, I will build a body of work that documents people along the pipeline route and share these striking pieces with Canada and the world. </span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Visual media has been a critical tool in mobilizing tens of thousands of people in Canada and the US to stop the extraction and exporting of Tar Sands oil. Poignant and powerful photographs and videos were key to visualizing and sharing the struggle and delaying the Keystone XL pipeline in the US.<br/><br/>Energy East is Canada's opportunity to do the same. ""Along the Pipeline"" will share the untold story of what the pipeline will really mean for Canadians and First Nations.<br/><br/>By leveraging the power of visual storytelling we can bring people from all over Canada to the frontlines of this issue. People who see this exhibit will recognize themselves and their communities in the faces of others and realize that they are not alone. <br/><br/>The great news is that I have already partnered with several leading environmental groups in Canada to put this media to use. We will work to come up with the best strategy to share the exhibit far and wide through a mix of online and offline media outlets and venues.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>À propos de East Energy </h3>
<p>TransCanada, l’entreprise soutenant le projet de pipeline Keystone XL, propose un autre pipeline, mais cette fois-­‐ci traversant le territoire Canadien. Si le projet est approuvé, East Energy pourra transporter 1,1 million de barils de bitume par jour à partir des sables bitumineux de la province de l’Alberta à Saint-­‐Jean. Il croisera des centaines de cours d'eau et fournisseurs en eau potable et sera responsable d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre égale à 7 millions de voitures neuves circulant sur les routes. </p>
<p>Est-­‐ce l’avenir que nous voulons ?</p>
<p>Avec votre soutien, je vais créer un ensemble de travaux qui informera les populations durant la traversée du pipeline et fera partager ces résultats impressionnants au Canada et dans le monde. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>L’impact </h3>
<p>Les médias ont été un outil essentiel dans la mobilisation de dizaines de milliers de personnes au Canada et aux États-­‐Unis pour arrêter l’extraction et l'exportation de pétrole des sables bitumineux. Les photographies et reportages poignants et lourds d’émotions ont joué un rôle clé dans le combat et ont permis de retarder le projet de pipeline Keystone XL lancé aux États-­‐Unis. </p>
<p>Le projet East Energy est l'occasion pour le Canada de renouveler ce combat. "" Le long du pipeline "" vise à sensibiliser le public sur la signification du pipeline pour les Canadiens et les Premières Nations. </p>
<p>En profitant de l’intensité de la narration visuelle, nous pourrons conduire les gens au Canada à réfléchir sur cette question. Les personnes qui assisteront à cette exposition se reconnaitront dans ces communautés et prendront conscience qu'ils ne sont pas seuls. </p>
<p>La bonne nouvelle est que j'ai déjà tissé des liens de partenariat avec plusieurs grands groupes environnementaux du Canada afin d’utiliser ce média. Nous allons travailler à la mise en place de la meilleure stratégie pour diffuser cette exposition par divers canaux d’informations, tant en ligne que dans les points de vente ou sur des sites internet. </p>
<p>Alors maintenant, je dois juste le créer ! </p>
<p>Avec les antécédents de projets et d’images affichées à l'Organisation des Nations Unies (ONU) à New York, sur la Colline du Parlement à Ottawa et au Parlement européen à Bruxelles, je suis convaincu qu’avec votre soutien, nous réussirons. Comment nous aider ? </p>

<h3>Encore plus de bonnes nouvelles!</h3>
<p>Nos partenaires d'organisation environnementales ont déjà apporté un financement de démarrage. Cependant, il n’est pas suffisant pour le considérer comme un succès, c'est pourquoi je fais appel à votre générosité. </p>
<p>J'ai besoin de financements pour des éléments basiques comme le transport, le carburant, la nourriture et – d’un assistant. Avec votre soutien, je peux engager un webdesigner spécialisé en multimédia / vidéo / médias sociaux (et déjà prêt à partir!) pour nous aider durant le voyage. Nos partenaires nous aideront avec les médias sociaux, la documentation, la logistique et bien-­‐sûr la conduite, pour que je ne m'endorme pas au volant ! </p>

<h3>Ce que vous obtenez </h3>
<p>En plus de mon éternelle reconnaissance et de ce sentiment agréable qui vient à l'appui d'un projet, j'ai compilé plusieurs « avantages » excitants (à mon humble avis) pour votre contribution. Il s'agit notamment de cartes postales mystérieuses, postées d’un peu partout au Canada, de posters, de consultations et quelques petites choses. Détails à droite. </p>
<p>Si grâce à votre soutien généreux je soulève plus de 10 000$, ce serait génial! L’excédent sera utilisé pour créer un mini-­‐ documentaire sur le voyage, construire un site web , et consacrer une partie du temps pour le succès du projet.</p>

 Version Français Dessous
 

I am looking for supporters that believe that culture and art have an important role to play in building a better world. Supporters that believe in thriving communities. Supporters that care about the environment and think it is time for change! Are you one of those? Than please add your voice, donate and join me on this journey.


What Is 'Along the Pipeline'


An ambitious project to photograph those impacted by the proposed Energy East pipeline.
In a few weeks I will be starting out on a long journey to follow the route of the proposed Energy East pipeline from Hardistry, Alberta to St.John, New Brunswick in Canada. I will use photography to create portraits and multimedia pieces that put a human face on this pipeline. Through this work I hope to demonstrate the strength of Canadians and First Nations, what we value and how this project will have far reaching implications.
The end goal of this project is a photography exhibit that will help elevate the conversation in Canada around pipelines and climate change. Several leading environmental NGOs in Canada are already planning how to incorporate this exhibit into their work. 
I was born in Canada and lived for many years in the Netherlands. I believe in the role of art and photography to create a thriving world. Throughout my career I have used photography to focus on issues related to our rapidly changing climate. I have worked for Canadian Geographic, National Geographic Traveler and a variety of NGOs. My work can be found at vanwaardenphoto.com.



About Energy East
TransCanada, the same company behind the Keystone XL pipeline, is proposing another pipeline but this time across Canada. If approved, Energy East would transport 1.1 million barrels of diluted bitumen a day from the oil sands of Alberta to St. John. It would cross hundreds of waterways and drinking water supplies and would be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions that would equal 7 million new
cars on the road. 

Is this the future we want?
With your support, I will build a body of work that documents people along the pipeline route and share these striking pieces with Canada and the world.

The Impact




Visual media has been a critical tool in mobilizing tens of thousands of people in Canada and the US to stop the extraction and exporting of Tar Sands oil. Poignant and powerful photographs and videos were key to visualizing and sharing the struggle and delaying the Keystone XL pipeline in the US.Energy East is Canada's opportunity to do the same. ""Along the Pipeline"" will share the untold story of what the pipeline will really mean for Canadians and First Nations.By leveraging the power of visual storytelling we can bring people from all over Canada to the frontlines of this issue. People who see this exhibit will recognize themselves and their communities in the faces of others and realize that they are not alone. The great news is that I have already partnered with several leading environmental groups in Canada to put this media to use. We will work to come up with the best strategy to share the exhibit far and wide through a mix of online and offline media outlets and venues.


So now I just have to create it!
With a track record that includes projects and images being displayed at the UN in New York, on Parliament Hill in Ottawa and the EU parliament in Brussels, I am confident that with your support we can make this happen.







How You Can Help 

More great news! Those environmental organization partners have already provided some seed funding. However, it isn't enough to make this a success and that is why I am asking for your help. 
I need funding for basic items like transportation, fuel, food and - critically - an assistant. With your support I can hire an amazing multimedia/video/social-media person (who is already ready to go!) to help out on the journey. They will help with the social media, documentation, the logistics and of course the driving so I don't fall asleep at the wheel. 
You can help by donating above.

What You Get

Besides my eternal gratitude and that fuzzy feeling that comes with supporting a project, I have compiled some really exciting (in my humble opinion) 'perks' for your support. These include mystery postcards from somewhere in Canada, prints, consultations and a few other things. Details on the right. 
If through your generous support I raise more than 10K that would be amazing! The extra will be used to create a mini documentary about the voyage, build a website, and dedicate time post journey to make the project a success.



Other Ways You Can Help

If you can’t contribute financially, that doesn’t mean you can’t help. Share this campaign with your friends. Use the Indiegogo share tools on this site to help me get the word out!
Or Get Involved. Join or volunteer with a local organization or community campaign. Here are some great organizations to consider.  


Greenpeace is always running exciting campaigns.
In Ontario, Environmental Defence is running some exciting community based initiatives. 
In New Brunswick the Conservation Council and the New Brunswick Environmental Network are amazing. 
In Quebec, Equiterre is an the one to seek out, join them. 
350.org is building an incredible movement world wide. 
LeadNow, an independent advocacy organization that is bringing Canadians together to achieve progress through democracy is great, connect with them.

TransCanada, l’entreprise soutenant le projet de pipeline Keystone XL, propose un autre pipeline, mais cette fois-­‐ci traversant le territoire Canadien. Si le projet est approuvé, East Energy pourra transporter 1,1 million de barils de bitume par jour à partir des sables bitumineux de la province de l’Alberta à Saint-­‐Jean. Il croisera des centaines de cours d'eau et fournisseurs en eau potable et sera responsable d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre égale à 7 millions de voitures neuves circulant sur les routes. 
Est-­‐ce l’avenir que nous voulons ?
Avec votre soutien, je vais créer un ensemble de travaux qui informera les populations durant la traversée du pipeline et fera partager ces résultats impressionnants au Canada et dans le monde. 


Environmental Defence

L’impact 
Les médias ont été un outil essentiel dans la mobilisation de dizaines de milliers de personnes au Canada et aux États-­‐Unis pour arrêter l’extraction et l'exportation de pétrole des sables bitumineux. Les photographies et reportages poignants et lourds d’émotions ont joué un rôle clé dans le combat et ont permis de retarder le projet de pipeline Keystone XL lancé aux États-­‐Unis. 
Le projet East Energy est l'occasion pour le Canada de renouveler ce combat. "" Le long du pipeline "" vise à sensibiliser le public sur la signification du pipeline pour les Canadiens et les Premières Nations. 
En profitant de l’intensité de la narration visuelle, nous pourrons conduire les gens au Canada à réfléchir sur cette question. Les personnes qui assisteront à cette exposition se reconnaitront dans ces communautés et prendront conscience qu'ils ne sont pas seuls. 
La bonne nouvelle est que j'ai déjà tissé des liens de partenariat avec plusieurs grands groupes environnementaux du Canada afin d’utiliser ce média. Nous allons travailler à la mise en place de la meilleure stratégie pour diffuser cette exposition par divers canaux d’informations, tant en ligne que dans les points de vente ou sur des sites internet. 
Alors maintenant, je dois juste le créer ! 
Avec les antécédents de projets et d’images affichées à l'Organisation des Nations Unies (ONU) à New York, sur la Colline du Parlement à Ottawa et au Parlement européen à Bruxelles, je suis convaincu qu’avec votre soutien, nous réussirons. Comment nous aider ? 

Encore plus de bonnes nouvelles!
Nos partenaires d'organisation environnementales ont déjà apporté un financement de démarrage. Cependant, il n’est pas suffisant pour le considérer comme un succès, c'est pourquoi je fais appel à votre générosité. 
J'ai besoin de financements pour des éléments basiques comme le transport, le carburant, la nourriture et – d’un assistant. Avec votre soutien, je peux engager un webdesigner spécialisé en multimédia / vidéo / médias sociaux (et déjà prêt à partir!) pour nous aider durant le voyage. Nos partenaires nous aideront avec les médias sociaux, la documentation, la logistique et bien-­‐sûr la conduite, pour que je ne m'endorme pas au volant ! 
Vous pouvez aider en faisant un don ci-­‐dessous. 
Ce que vous obtenez 
En plus de mon éternelle reconnaissance et de ce sentiment agréable qui vient à l'appui d'un projet, j'ai compilé plusieurs « avantages » excitants (à mon humble avis) pour votre contribution. Il s'agit notamment de cartes postales mystérieuses, postées d’un peu partout au Canada, de posters, de consultations et quelques petites choses. Détails à droite. 
Si grâce à votre soutien généreux je soulève plus de 10 000$, ce serait génial! L’excédent sera utilisé pour créer un mini-­‐ documentaire sur le voyage, construire un site web , et consacrer une partie du temps pour le succès du projet.

If you're seeing this then we likely know each other, so lets get shooting. But if we're not acquainted yet, please read on. Since 1997, I have worked professionally in front of and behind the camera in film, television, and print modeling, so I'm experienced, fun to work with, and I know what style of photos work in the industry. I can also bring out your best in personal photos, family portraits and capture all the right moments at events. www.1jameshuang.com/photo
James Huang Photography (1jameshuang) This is me:






Photography is an extension of my current actors demo reels business which I've been doing for many years as a way to help my fellow actor by filming and/or editing performance reels. You'll see on my IMDb that I'm a very active filmmaker and have written and directed feature films and short films. My whole life has been dedicated to working in the arts and photography feels like a natural progression and extension of my career. To build my body of work, I am offering my photographic services as very inexpensive perks to you.

Why I'm IndieGoGo-ing?


I'm not a novice, but I'm still working on my craft. I want to build my business and practice my photography with people I can feel comfortable with. I feel this model will ease the pressure of us working together and I hope to spread the word this way through my network of friends and referrals. I will work my tail off to deliver fantastic photos. I'm establishing myself so you can be assured I'm going to do my best for you. Let's establish a working relationship together and continue to working in the future.
Photo gear is really expensive and I need to buy more. So I'm putting in the work to build my brand and expand my photo capabilities. 

  Risks & Challenges 
We're in this together. I'm nice, easy going, and very good at taking all kinds of photos. But everyone has their own idealized notion of photography. Let's talk about the looks you want to achieve and discuss how we can get the photos you want ahead of time.
I will do everything I can to ensure that you have great photos and a great experience. We're helping each other - Remember, this is IndieGoGo, not Groupon. Either way, you're getting a steal.
PRIVACY - I plan to include my best photos to build my professional portfolio on-line but I will NOT include a photo of you without your permission first. I will guarantee the safety of your images as it is in both of our best interest as professionals. 
  Other Ways You Can Help 
Please spread the word to people you know or surprise a friend by gifting them a perk. Everyone needs photos - just maybe not right this minute. So book me now and schedule me later.
You can chip in a few bucks just to be super awesome or even get a link to your website on my photo website's 'Wall of Thanks' for $15 or $25.

<p>Becoming Iranian is a book of 81 photographs, captions and notes that give vision to a misunderstood place. The book is my way of answering a question: what does it mean for me to be Iranian as a young man born and raised in the United States?</p>
<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p>On September 10th, 2011 the only thing I could
think about was how to come up with $10,000 to
pay the Iranian conscription board and avoid 21
months of military service. It was 91 days since I
landed in Tehran which meant I wouldn’t be
allowed to leave without serving or paying. I
could have left earlier, but I needed more time.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>In June 2011, I moved to Iran to
spend a year understanding the place where my
father was born and raised, and to which I had
never been. I went in blind, not speaking Farsi, to
meet my family, to ask what it meant for me to be
Iranian. My tools were a camera, dozens of
journals and a tape recorder. </p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Over the next two and a half years I
photographed my way through Iran. It took a
year to pay off the military, teaching English for
$3.40 an hour. I made friends, fell in and out of
love and joined the ranks of Tehran’s wandering
souls. I traveled throughout the country, road
tripping with friends through Iranian Kurdistan,
Azerbaijan and the Turkmen Sahra. I hitchhiked
across the central Iranian desert from Isfahan to
the Afghan border near Tabas and ferried
between the islands of the Persian Gulf. </p>

</div></div>","BECOMING IRANIAN BOOK
Becoming Iranian is a book of 81 photographs, captions and notes that give vision to a misunderstood place. The book is my way of answering a question: what does it mean for me to be Iranian as a young man born and raised in the United States?
THE STORY





On September 10th, 2011 the only thing I could
think about was how to come up with $10,000 to
pay the Iranian conscription board and avoid 21
months of military service. It was 91 days since I
landed in Tehran which meant I wouldn’t be
allowed to leave without serving or paying. I
could have left earlier, but I needed more time.






In June 2011, I moved to Iran to
spend a year understanding the place where my
father was born and raised, and to which I had
never been. I went in blind, not speaking Farsi, to
meet my family, to ask what it meant for me to be
Iranian. My tools were a camera, dozens of
journals and a tape recorder. 



Over the next two and a half years I
photographed my way through Iran. It took a
year to pay off the military, teaching English for
$3.40 an hour. I made friends, fell in and out of
love and joined the ranks of Tehran’s wandering
souls. I traveled throughout the country, road
tripping with friends through Iranian Kurdistan,
Azerbaijan and the Turkmen Sahra. I hitchhiked
across the central Iranian desert from Isfahan to
the Afghan border near Tabas and ferried
between the islands of the Persian Gulf. 


WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETWe are asking for your help in raising $11,350 to fund the final editing, design, and printing of the book. Every perk is 100%  original and unique; from original content and design to unique perspectives on Iran.
Editing $2,000: I've teamed up with New York City artist and master black and white printer Barron Rachman, www.barronrachman.com. Barron’s commitment to image construction is uncompromising. In addition to dedication to form and design Barron has unique experience in the region working as a photojournalist in the middle east throughout the 1990’s and early 2000’s.

Design $2,000: Barron and I will also oversee the design team.

Printing $6,140: At 500 units, the cost per book allows us to offer the final copy at an accessible price. Our goal is to give as many people access to the work as possible without losing the cohesion of the work.
ISBN Number and Barcode $160: In order for the book to be distributed beyond the campaign we'll need it to be identified with an International Standard Book Number and an individual Universal Product Code.

Indiegogo $1050: Estimating the cost associated with Indiegogo is difficult because it depends on the number of donations and the method of donating. Indiegogo's base fee is 5% of the total funds raised. They also charge 3% plus $0.30 per credit card transaction or 3-5% for each Pay-Pal transaction. Estimating 500 donations, mostly via credit card a rough cut for Indiegogo is $1,050.






If our goal is not reached all the funds will go toward the production of a smaller version of the same book. Our aim is to produce a final piece, not simply a series of photographs, but a story. A document.






THE IMPACT
 




The world is dominated by storybook images, sound bites and immediate conclusions, so much
so that complexity and nuance are often lost. Conclusions aren’t drawn from a review of news
outlets, they are doled out by them. Becoming Iranian was photographed over two and a half

I don't shy away from the complexities of Iran, identity and dual societies. I embrace them. Becoming Iranian is not a series of conclusions; I leave that to the reader, trusting that individuals can and should reach their own understanding. 







RISKS & CHALLENGES

 




It is a risk pricing using 500 units as a reference point. The margin of error
is as low as it can be. When asked what qualifies me to overcome this challenge the answer is
simple. I’ve raised $10,000 once before, only it wasn’t for 500 books. It was to get home.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In 2016 we started our first Indiegogo campaign for ""Those Who Remain"" and we were blown away by the support we got for the project. Since then we have been working hard in Moldova with our deportees to tell their story and bare witness to the injustices they faced under the Soviet Union. The description of our project is;</p>
<p><i>In Moldova, there is a lost generation of children who were deported with their families, without trial, to the Eastern Soviet States in the early 1900's. These children are now living the twilight years of their lives with the memories of their deportation deeply ingrained in their minds. Those Who Remain explores the personal histories of surviving deportees as a way to provide a platform for sharing and exploring the issues and history of the deportations on a national and international level.  </i></p>
<p><i>We want to share these story without bias, in a truthful, genuine manner and in a way that gives deportees back the voices that were stripped from them.</i></p>
<p>And we have done just that! We have worked to gather stories and put them together to tell the beautiful and in-depth stories around the deportations. While our initial Indiegogo campaign allowed us to start the project, our Indiegogo campaign now will allow us to finish the story with the completion of Stage 2 shooting and completing all photography work in Moldova. Before we continue we want to share some story excerpts from the work we have done thus far;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491985335/mwej8dndoxqwonmmystz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>One December afternoon Ana and I went to her mother's gravesite to visit at my request. On the way there, Ana joked that she was calling her mother to tell her she was coming. ""Mama? Mama? Can you hear me?"" She said into her hand, ""We are coming to visit OK? I am coming with [Clary]."" I smiled as we walked arm in arm.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>When we arrived and Ana stepped closer to her mother's grave she began to cry, ""Mother I am here."" She kept saying, ""I am here, mother. I have come."" As we leave she laid to small sweet cookies on the gravestone. ""These are for my mother,"" she says, ""but the birds will eat them for her.""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491985429/wr5fng9zj9r8ruglsave.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>When Pasha's son, Leonid, came to visit from Ukraine, she lamented that he spent so little time with her. Leonid, in his youth, was a professional soccer player, a fact that Pasha is proud of despite the fact that it required him to be away often. One day during Leonid’s visit, wearing a red dress sent to her from family in Italy, she said, ""I dressed nicely, yet Leonid doesn't come."" Leonid instead decided to spend much of his trip visiting his cousin, Alex, Ana's son.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Both Pasha’s sister, Ana, and her daughter-in-law, Ludmilla lament that same fact. “As you can see she has no one,” they tell me one evening, “She has no one to come visit her and she is very lonely.” Ana is even moved to tears that the family cannot do more for her.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and as a result life can be extremely hard. Ludmilla has to travel to Italy every three months to work to pay off the wedding of her eldest child, Ana’s grandchild, Ioana, and the family worries about Pasha’s death. “That would be a tragedy if she died,” she says, “We cannot pay for the funeral and my son, Pavel, will be getting married as well.” Ana cries to me, “Please do something for Pasha, please!” “I will try.” I say, but I little know what to do.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>A common theme to the deportee’s story is that the story did not end after Stalin’s death. The larger story is about the social and political repression felt by deportees after they returned to Moldova, as well as the long process of building their lives back up after having everything taken away. The resilience of the deportees who experienced this history shows that through great pain, life does go on.</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491985585/cala9lxquimorszhiqej.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Ion says goodbye to Nina one last time at her gravesite on November 27th, 2016. I had called Thanksgiving day in hopes that I could spend ""Old Christmas,"" the orthodox epiphany date of Christmas in Moldova held on January 7th.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Ion answered the phone. When I asked how he was doing he simply replied, ""Bad."" ""Why bad?"" I asked. ""Nina a morit."" He said. Nina died.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>I was shook by the unexpected loss. For the next couple of days I was sure that I had misheard Ion. 'My Romanian is bad, I couldn't have understood correctly,' I thought. But unfortunately, when I went to their home, there Nina was. This beautiful light of a woman was gone.</i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What Have We Done So Far?</h3>
<p>In short, A LOT! Our team has done a number of things for the project including;</p>
<ul>
<li>Working one-on-one with deportees to cover all aspects in life from daily life to celebrations, from holidays to funerals, from the exciting to the dull, and everything in between</li>
<li>Developing and hosting oral history workshops across Moldova so that we can bring together people interested in the deportees history, as well as train the next generation of photographers, videographers and historians around this subject</li>
<li>Worked one-on-one with our animation partner to begin developing documentary animation for the project</li>
<li>Translated pages and pages of interviews to be shared with English-speaking audiences</li>
<li>Interviewed dozens of deportees across Moldova so that they can be archived and shared with future generations and researchers</li>
</ul>
<p>But there is still more to do! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need to Finish</h3>
<p>Our needs are quite simple, we need to finish shooting on location in Moldova. This includes traveling to the home-villages of former deportees and finding the homes they were evicted from, the train stations they we deported from and the traces of history that has been left in the Moldovan earth. Below we have a map of shooting locations;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491986041/pmcu2tek6b0w3cvwt8ss.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Floresti </strong><ul><li>The train station Pasha and Ana were deported from to Kazakhstan</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Nemteni</strong><ul><li>The village Nina and her family moved back to when they returned to Moldova, her sister is currently living there and we plan to interview her as well</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mereni</strong><ul><li>The village Ion's family lived in before their deportation and returned to after their release</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Northern Moldova, Glodeni region</strong><ul><li>We will be going to a region of northwestern Moldova to try and find Nina's mother and father's original home before they were deported</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Chisinau</strong><ul>
<li>The old train station in Chisinau where hundreds of thousands of Moldovans were deported</li>
<li>The largest cemetery of Eastern Europe, where many former deportees are buried</li>
<li>The Museum of History and Ethnography, where our animation partner, Ghenadie, lives and works and who we will be working with to make a series of animated documentary videos based on deportee stories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to all of these locations, we will be working with local historians to find and document regional areas associated with the deportations in order to expand the story and how it etched Moldova's history as a whole. We will also continue to conduct a series of deportee interviews with deportees across Moldova to share them with you once the project is complete! Once we have completed travel to each of these locations in Moldova we will start and finish compiling all of the work into one large exhibition which can be shared with our audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What are We Working Against?</h3>
<p>As we explained in our previous campaign;</p>
<p><i>We are working with a number of Moldovan partner organizations to get this project off the ground, and to keep it accurate to the experiences of Moldovans during the Soviet era. This is a complex and deep story and we recognize the importance of having Moldovan partners on board to tell it correctly.</i></p>
<p><i>Our biggest risk right now is time. Many of our deportees are very elderly and will not be with us much longer. We want to make sure their voices are preserved before they leave us. By helping us start this project now, not later, we can insure that their voices are preserved. We have relationships with these people and they want to tell their story. </i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, time has caught up with us and we lost one of our amazing deportees, Nina Postica. Nina died on Thanksgiving of 2016 and it was a surprising and terrible blow for the entire team. As part of the project we documented her funeral and continue to work with her husband, Ion, to tell their story. This issue continues to be something we work against. We have only a limited time to work with our deportees and we have to be sure that their story gets told.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
In 2016 we started our first Indiegogo campaign for ""Those Who Remain"" and we were blown away by the support we got for the project. Since then we have been working hard in Moldova with our deportees to tell their story and bare witness to the injustices they faced under the Soviet Union. The description of our project is;
In Moldova, there is a lost generation of children who were deported with their families, without trial, to the Eastern Soviet States in the early 1900's. These children are now living the twilight years of their lives with the memories of their deportation deeply ingrained in their minds. Those Who Remain explores the personal histories of surviving deportees as a way to provide a platform for sharing and exploring the issues and history of the deportations on a national and international level.  
We want to share these story without bias, in a truthful, genuine manner and in a way that gives deportees back the voices that were stripped from them.
And we have done just that! We have worked to gather stories and put them together to tell the beautiful and in-depth stories around the deportations. While our initial Indiegogo campaign allowed us to start the project, our Indiegogo campaign now will allow us to finish the story with the completion of Stage 2 shooting and completing all photography work in Moldova. Before we continue we want to share some story excerpts from the work we have done thus far;

One December afternoon Ana and I went to her mother's gravesite to visit at my request. On the way there, Ana joked that she was calling her mother to tell her she was coming. ""Mama? Mama? Can you hear me?"" She said into her hand, ""We are coming to visit OK? I am coming with [Clary]."" I smiled as we walked arm in arm.
When we arrived and Ana stepped closer to her mother's grave she began to cry, ""Mother I am here."" She kept saying, ""I am here, mother. I have come."" As we leave she laid to small sweet cookies on the gravestone. ""These are for my mother,"" she says, ""but the birds will eat them for her.""

When Pasha's son, Leonid, came to visit from Ukraine, she lamented that he spent so little time with her. Leonid, in his youth, was a professional soccer player, a fact that Pasha is proud of despite the fact that it required him to be away often. One day during Leonid’s visit, wearing a red dress sent to her from family in Italy, she said, ""I dressed nicely, yet Leonid doesn't come."" Leonid instead decided to spend much of his trip visiting his cousin, Alex, Ana's son.
Both Pasha’s sister, Ana, and her daughter-in-law, Ludmilla lament that same fact. “As you can see she has no one,” they tell me one evening, “She has no one to come visit her and she is very lonely.” Ana is even moved to tears that the family cannot do more for her.
Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and as a result life can be extremely hard. Ludmilla has to travel to Italy every three months to work to pay off the wedding of her eldest child, Ana’s grandchild, Ioana, and the family worries about Pasha’s death. “That would be a tragedy if she died,” she says, “We cannot pay for the funeral and my son, Pavel, will be getting married as well.” Ana cries to me, “Please do something for Pasha, please!” “I will try.” I say, but I little know what to do.
A common theme to the deportee’s story is that the story did not end after Stalin’s death. The larger story is about the social and political repression felt by deportees after they returned to Moldova, as well as the long process of building their lives back up after having everything taken away. The resilience of the deportees who experienced this history shows that through great pain, life does go on.

Ion says goodbye to Nina one last time at her gravesite on November 27th, 2016. I had called Thanksgiving day in hopes that I could spend ""Old Christmas,"" the orthodox epiphany date of Christmas in Moldova held on January 7th.
Ion answered the phone. When I asked how he was doing he simply replied, ""Bad."" ""Why bad?"" I asked. ""Nina a morit."" He said. Nina died.
I was shook by the unexpected loss. For the next couple of days I was sure that I had misheard Ion. 'My Romanian is bad, I couldn't have understood correctly,' I thought. But unfortunately, when I went to their home, there Nina was. This beautiful light of a woman was gone.
 
What Have We Done So Far?
In short, A LOT! Our team has done a number of things for the project including;

Working one-on-one with deportees to cover all aspects in life from daily life to celebrations, from holidays to funerals, from the exciting to the dull, and everything in between
Developing and hosting oral history workshops across Moldova so that we can bring together people interested in the deportees history, as well as train the next generation of photographers, videographers and historians around this subject
Worked one-on-one with our animation partner to begin developing documentary animation for the project
Translated pages and pages of interviews to be shared with English-speaking audiences
Interviewed dozens of deportees across Moldova so that they can be archived and shared with future generations and researchers

But there is still more to do! 

What We Need to Finish
Our needs are quite simple, we need to finish shooting on location in Moldova. This includes traveling to the home-villages of former deportees and finding the homes they were evicted from, the train stations they we deported from and the traces of history that has been left in the Moldovan earth. Below we have a map of shooting locations;



Floresti The train station Pasha and Ana were deported from to Kazakhstan


NemteniThe village Nina and her family moved back to when they returned to Moldova, her sister is currently living there and we plan to interview her as well


MereniThe village Ion's family lived in before their deportation and returned to after their release


Northern Moldova, Glodeni regionWe will be going to a region of northwestern Moldova to try and find Nina's mother and father's original home before they were deported


Chisinau
The old train station in Chisinau where hundreds of thousands of Moldovans were deported
The largest cemetery of Eastern Europe, where many former deportees are buried
The Museum of History and Ethnography, where our animation partner, Ghenadie, lives and works and who we will be working with to make a series of animated documentary videos based on deportee stories.



In addition to all of these locations, we will be working with local historians to find and document regional areas associated with the deportations in order to expand the story and how it etched Moldova's history as a whole. We will also continue to conduct a series of deportee interviews with deportees across Moldova to share them with you once the project is complete! Once we have completed travel to each of these locations in Moldova we will start and finish compiling all of the work into one large exhibition which can be shared with our audience.

 
What are We Working Against?
As we explained in our previous campaign;
We are working with a number of Moldovan partner organizations to get this project off the ground, and to keep it accurate to the experiences of Moldovans during the Soviet era. This is a complex and deep story and we recognize the importance of having Moldovan partners on board to tell it correctly.
Our biggest risk right now is time. Many of our deportees are very elderly and will not be with us much longer. We want to make sure their voices are preserved before they leave us. By helping us start this project now, not later, we can insure that their voices are preserved. We have relationships with these people and they want to tell their story. 
Unfortunately, time has caught up with us and we lost one of our amazing deportees, Nina Postica. Nina died on Thanksgiving of 2016 and it was a surprising and terrible blow for the entire team. As part of the project we documented her funeral and continue to work with her husband, Ion, to tell their story. This issue continues to be something we work against. We have only a limited time to work with our deportees and we have to be sure that their story gets told.

<p>I started over a year ago where I set out to take a picture a day for one year. After each photo was taken I would upload it to Facebook and allow my friends to suggest names for each image.</p>
<p>The intent of this project was to capture riveting images, and have them put into a book(s). While out on my year long journey,  I noticed that there were a great deal of homeless veterans on the streets of Dallas, as well as, veterans that are disabled and wounded warriors.</p>
<p>After a great deal of prayer and guidance from the Lord,  I realized I wanted to do something to stop the epidemic that is not only effecting Dallas, but this nation. And I had the tools at my hands to do so. The statistics of homeless veterans are  staggering. About 1 in 5 homeless people on the streets of Dallas are vets, that comes to a little over 2500 and climbing each day  with the returning vets from Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This project is to raise fund and awareness to benefit wounded and homeless veterans here in Dallas. I am not benefiting from it one bit. I hope you will feel the same as me, and the urgency to do whatever we can to make a difference in this growing crisis. I would like to thank you all in advance for your support and assistance in making this project come to life.</p>

<h3>Why a book on Vancouver?</h3>
<p>It all started some 10 years ago with a handful of photographs of iconic Vancouver landmarks including the Orpheum, the Marine Building and Siwash Rock to name a few. Produced as a small collection of commercial art prints, these led to the creation of my Vancouver Series of Fine Art Canvases, which has now grown to over 100 images.</p>
<p>Throughout this journey, what has always been magical for me are the connections people have with my work and their fond memories of places and time spent with their loved ones.</p>
<p>As the rapid urban development of Vancouver continues and the city's post-war character diminishes, I feel it is important to capture and preserve these experiences in a beautiful fine art book that can be cherished now and by future generations.</p>

<p>The Children of Inti project began by teaching art classes in the indigenous village of Pampacorral, in the Sacred Valley of Peru. </p>
<p>Resting 13,000 feet above sea level, the village has of around 100
students.  </p>
<p>Over the past years, the AASD has raised funds to purchase digital
cameras for the students – most of whom have never been exposed to technology
before.  AASD’s Eric Ebner taught
photography to more than 30 students between the ages of 10 and 18.  </p>
<p>The course produced incredible photography.  We were so amazed at the scenic photos

<p>So on March 21<sup>st</sup>, 2015 – we want to take 30 students to
the city of Cusco to post a large photo mural right in the Historic Center in
the main Plaza de Armas.</p>
<p>We want to provide this opportunity for the students because webelieve in their creativity
and the empowerment it triggers.  The photo mural project enables the

</div></div>","The OUTREACH program is the start of discovering your potential, and is committed to seeing you
succeed. —Ebti Nabag, artist, teacher,
and 2011 participant

Every year, with the support of individuals like
you, Gallery 44 offers free, creative workshops to youth from under served communities across the Greater Toronto Area.
OUTREACH, an award-winning education program designed for youth, uses photography as a medium and catalyst for creative
self-expression. Engaging youth in a
process they direct from beginning to end, OUTREACH helps to break down
barriers to the arts, and encourages independence and creative growth.""I love this program. It keeps me active, it keeps me out of trouble, it keeps my mind going...it makes me see things in a whole different way.” —Rickson Thom, OUTREACH participant, 2014Photo by Jocelyn Reynolds, OUTREACH instructor 2015
In conjunction with the program’s
artistic goals, OUTREACH aspires to provide a better sense of connection with
the self and with peers, while creating a platform to address issues significant
to the participants. OUTREACH helps build confidence through artistic production and participation. Photo by Heran Genene, OUTREACH participant 2014About Gallery 44Gallery 44 Centre for Contemporary Photography is a non-profit artist-run centre committed to photography as a multi-faceted and ever-changing art form. Founded in 1979 to establish a supportive environment for the development of photography, Gallery 44’s mandate is to provide a context for reflection and dialogue on contemporary photography and its related practices.Gallery 44 offers exhibition and publication opportunities to national and international artists, award-winning education programs, and affordable production facilities for artists. Through its programs Gallery 44 is engaged in changing conceptions of the photographic image and its modes of production.“The OUTREACH program was my first official introduction to the magic of darkroom film photography. G44 gave me a chance to believe in myself and what I was capable of achieving. The OUTREACH program changes the lives of youth; I am a living example. For once in my life I was given an opportunity to believe in myself and to explore a new medium.”—Giselle Mira Diaz, OUTREACH participant and David Barker Maltby Award winner, 2011. Giselle is currently participating in North Sur, a photo exchange project for PANAMANIA, commissioned by the Arts and Culture Program of the TORONTO 2015 Pan Am and Parapan Am Games.Youth working in Gallery 44 Darkroom, 20142015 Community Partners“Nia’s partnership with Gallery 44 has a profound impact on young photographers”—Mark Campbell, executive director, Nia Centre for the Arts Gallery 44 works collaboratively with community
groups serving youth to provide a program that can be customized to the needs
of the participants. Qualified photographers with a personal connection to each
community organization teach the hands-on photography workshops.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Dino Mangano, and I am a high school teacher, as well as a freelance photographer  One of my passions, in addition to photography, is wine, specifically Michigan wine.  Most of America knows about the West Coast wineries, but very few know about the amazing wines made here on the ""North Coast"".  My dream is to create a Michigan Wineries Photo Book that is as vibrant, unique, and appealing as the wineries and vineyards it will contain.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will this book be a wonderful collectors item, but it will help to open the eyes of American wine lovers to the special wines created here in Michigan, a State that is in dire need of positive economic growth.  We have award winning wines that rival those in more well known regions, and some incredibly beautiful landscape to grow them on.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This plan will not be overly expensive, but fundraising is still necessary.  I will need to take a 3-4 day photo excursion to the Leelaneau and Old Mission Peninsulas, during August or September (when grapes are their fullest).  I'll need funding to cover basic trip costs (lodging, food, gas, etc).  Once done, I'll need funds for editing, printing and publishing.  My goal is to do all this for $1000.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word!  This project can help not only a blossoming photographer, but also lend a helping hand to a wonderful area of a wonderful State.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Neil and I currently reside in Arizona.  Since 1996 I was in Law Enforcement. In 2008 I was forced out of career due to pain in my upper back and neck.  The doctors couldn't diagnose the problem for three years, but they finally found out what was causing so much pain.  Late last year I was required to have surgery on my neck, fusing the C4-C6 vertebrae, thus ending any chance of returning to Law Enforcement.  Now, I'm forced to start all over at the age of 42.  This is the toughest thing I've ever had to do, however, I have decided that since I must make a new start in life, I am going to do something I love to do, which is photography.  Now, here's the problem I face.</p>
<p>Three years of doctor's visits, ending in a surgical procedure has drained my pension and my savings. Like millions of people out there, I struggle with making ends meet.  My wife is on Disability and it is the only income we have.  Unfortunately, it barely covers our costs of living.  We have had to sell of many of our possessions, to include our vehicles, just to maintain a roof over our heads. But, God has blessed me with a talent that can help me and my family stay above the proverbial water line. </p>
<p>The biggest issue I'm facing at the moment is the fact that no one wants to take me seriously enough to give me a paying job.  The reason for that isn't the quality of my work, but the equipment that I have.  You see, I'm currently using a Nikon Coolpix L120.  Great camera, in fact, everything posted in the Gallery section was taken with it.  But, if you ask any photographer out there, today, they'll tell you that to get a serious job, you need serious equipment.  If you look like an amateur, you'll be treated like one.</p>
<p>Now, I have two choices. Either I dwell on what was lost, or put my heart and soul into another dream I've had since I was young. You guessed it, I'm going to put everything I have into my passion for photography. Speaking of passion, I can think of nothing more symbolically passionate than a Sunset. Not just any Sunset, though, I'm talking about the kind of Sunsets you can only find in the Deserts and Mountains of Arizona. Not to mention the Grand Canyon. How often can you say that you've seen the Sun set over one of the 7 Great Wonders of the World? I want to bring this kind of passion to you via my photography. Unfortunately, there's something lost in it that can only be captured with a DSLR. And this is where you come in.</p>
<p>If you look off the right of your screen, you'll see some perks for donating. These perks might seem trivial, afterall, who am I to send out autographed photos, right? I""m the guy thats going to make a big splash in the world of Photography and when I do, these early prints that I'm offering here will <strong>only go up in value</strong>. Now, if you can't afford to donate cash, there's another option. If you have used equipment you would like to donate you can contact me at neilorrphotography@gmail.com and I will give you a shipping address.  Every little bit helps.  Thank you and God Bless.</p>

Through hard work and dedication, we are fundraising money by selling handmade products. For one week, we design sculptures out of recycled bike parts and take photographs, letting our creativity flow while stimulating our evolving minds. The photographs taken are turned into a variety of things, such as coasters, mouse-pads, notebooks, calendars, and cards, while the sculptures are sold to raise money in the hope of future chances to engage in immersive learning outside of school.</p><p>   The money raised is used to give us opportunities to go on field trips and provide us with extracurricular educational experiences.  One of the most prominent weeks we focus on in the Middle School is Drama Week. During Drama Week we develop our skills in the performing arts by writing short stories and bringing them to life in plays. During Drama Week, students focus on building their self-confidence and working with each other.  </p><p>   There are other purposes for our fundraising, too.  Near the end of the year, we go to a three-day sleep-away camp; the University of Arizona’s Sky School on Mt. Lemmon. There, our work is mostly centered around astronomy.  We also research other fields of science as well, like geology, ecology, and engineering. </p><p>   We make our metal art by going to a bike shop that recycles old bike parts and turns them into artistic pieces. Our group designed multiple metal pieces of artwork that were later welded by a professional welder, including a coffee table, candleholders, a jellyfish, and flowers. To create our unique photographs, we walked around the University of Arizona campus taking high-quality pictures of our urban and desert setting. We hope that you enjoy the work we have spent this week doing and will help us reach our goal of 2,000 dollars. Thank you! </p><p>Continue to scroll down to see the different types of candle holders you are able to purchase, as well as the pictures we took.

14 seventh and eighth graders from a Montessori Middle School. Through hard work and dedication, we are fundraising money by selling handmade products. For one week, we design sculptures out of recycled bike parts and take photographs, letting our creativity flow while stimulating our evolving minds. The photographs taken are turned into a variety of things, such as coasters, mouse-pads, notebooks, calendars, and cards, while the sculptures are sold to raise money in the hope of future chances to engage in immersive learning outside of school.   The money raised is used to give us opportunities to go on field trips and provide us with extracurricular educational experiences.  One of the most prominent weeks we focus on in the Middle School is Drama Week. During Drama Week we develop our skills in the performing arts by writing short stories and bringing them to life in plays. During Drama Week, students focus on building their self-confidence and working with each other.     There are other purposes for our fundraising, too.  Near the end of the year, we go to a three-day sleep-away camp; the University of Arizona’s Sky School on Mt. Lemmon. There, our work is mostly centered around astronomy.  We also research other fields of science as well, like geology, ecology, and engineering.    We make our metal art by going to a bike shop that recycles old bike parts and turns them into artistic pieces. Our group designed multiple metal pieces of artwork that were later welded by a professional welder, including a coffee table, candleholders, a jellyfish, and flowers. To create our unique photographs, we walked around the University of Arizona campus taking high-quality pictures of our urban and desert setting. We hope that you enjoy the work we have spent this week doing and will help us reach our goal of 2,000 dollars. Thank you! Continue to scroll down to see the different types of candle holders you are able to purchase, as well as the pictures we took.

The project:""DOLOMITI, see them, love them"" is a premium quality photo-book about the Dolomites. The book is the first part of the long-term project ''I love the Dolomites' to document the Dolomites in all their aspects.
The Dolomitesare widely regarded as being among the most attractive mountain landscapes in the world. (UNESCO, STATEMENT OF OUTSTANDING UNIVERSAL VALUE, CRITERION VII:to contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance)
The book includes:   
120 images (with GPS-coordinates of the peaks and the point of view)

My top-10 Vie Ferrate

Information about ""Alte Vie delle Dolomiti""

information for summer and winter sports (vie ferrate, climbing, biking, skiing)

historical and geolocial facts

All the huts and tourist information offices including email, phone and website (+ GPS data)




Why I need your help:I invested a lot of effort, time and money to take the pictures and collect all the material. At this point I need your help to cover the initial costs of the print process. The first production run to print a high quality book is costly. 
The quality of the book:The book will be a hard cover, landscape format (31,5cm x 24,5cm), high quality paper, printed by one of the best book printers in Italy. The pictures were taken with high-quality cameras with amazing details.You will enjoy this quality from the first moment you will hold the book in your hands. It's a photo-book for mountain-lovers, hikers, climbers, explorers and everybody interested in the unique beauty this mountains offer.About me:I am a photographer / designer living in the Dolomites. The last ten years I spent every free minute I had hiking and climbing up to special spots to take pictures, make timelapse movies and collect informations about the Dolomites, the so called pale mountains.I collected a lot of material! Really a lot!NOW it's time to share the beauty of the mountains I love with you. My goal is to make a premium quality, 200 page hardcover book with all the relevant informations about the Dolomites. Along with the book there will be the website 'i Love the Dolomites' delivering additional informations like GPS coordinates where the pictures have been taken.How can you get involved?

I want to also share the making of process with you and offer the possibility to buy an affordable art print.
<p>I don't have problems with hunting for food. But I do have a problem with trophy hunting when an animal is killed merely for its antlers or the head and the rest of the carcass goes to waste. Also killing endangered species is a huge problem. I want this image to reflect these aspects.</p>

<p>In Ontario, there isn’t a single museum that is dedicated to Photography and its’ related artifacts. There are many people who are passionate about photography and have their own collection. However, as these are private collections, the general public never has a chance to see them. This is why I started the Photographic Museum of Ontario.</p>
<p>In the 1995 Kodak Canada sold their 55-Acre property in Toronto as a means to downsize. Metrus Properties purchased that land in order to build mega box stores. The citizens of Weston (a small area in Toronto) protested this idea for many years. With continuing resistance from local residents, Metrus Properties sold the land to Metrolinx. Now the property is slated to become a subway hub and the last remaining building is designated to become offices.</p>
<p>We need to preserve our photographic history and particularly in the City where photography truly began in Canada. At this point in time, most levels of government are not interested in helping with the start up of the museum. The onus will be on the generosity of the public.</p>
<p>We are now in communication with Metrolinx to purchase or lease this historic property to preserve our history. The cost to purchase and renovate will run into the millions. Thus your generous donations will be essential to the success of our museum.</p>
<p>All donations to the Photographic Museum of Ontario will receive a Canadian tax receipt. Any amount is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Thank you for you time and generosity. Please spread the word about our mission.</p>

However, as these are private collections, the general public never has a chance to see them. This is why I started the Photographic Museum of Ontario.
In the 1995 Kodak Canada sold their 55-Acre property in Toronto as a means to downsize. Metrus Properties purchased that land in order to build mega box stores. The citizens of Weston (a small area in Toronto) protested this idea for many years. With continuing resistance from local residents, Metrus Properties sold the land to Metrolinx. Now the property is slated to become a subway hub and the last remaining building is designated to become offices.
We need to preserve our photographic history and particularly in the City where photography truly began in Canada. At this point in time, most levels of government are not interested in helping with the start up of the museum. The onus will be on the generosity of the public.
We are now in communication with Metrolinx to purchase or lease this historic property to preserve our history. The cost to purchase and renovate will run into the millions. Thus your generous donations will be essential to the success of our museum.
All donations to the Photographic Museum of Ontario will receive a Canadian tax receipt. Any amount is greatly appreciated. 
Thank you for you time and generosity. Please spread the word about our mission.
For updates on the museum, or to make a donation, please visit: www.photographicmuseumofontario.org
 
Thank you,

<p>Here, ""TBD"" means that I have at least a few candidates but I may not have chosen the final casting yet. Rest assured there are several viable candidates for these roles, and I'm in the process of test shooting and choosing the final one. </p>
<p>Depending on the level of funding the project receives, I may add the Wise Man and other bonuses. </p>
<p>As you can see above, I have already cast the two most difficult parts to fill. I've done extensive test shooting with my ""Babydoll"" and some test shooting with ""Amber"". I'm fully confident that I will cast the remaining three in time to do the shoot and fill the perks. If I have to, I can always import models from anywhere, should the stretch goals get high enough. We'll explore that later. </p>
<p>I'll be adding images from the first Babydoll test shoot really soon, but wanted to go ahead and get this launched now. </p>
<p>For a special look at the first test shoot, see the images below, or find the full size images on my site at <a href=""http://www"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www</a>.<a href=""http://uryaen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uryaen.com</a>. </p>
<p>This shoot will happen even if the project isn't funded. How many projects promise you that? The main difference is whether we get to see some of neat upgrades to it that I have planned, and the perks. So pledge with confidence! This is purely a fun project, and not a ""for profit"" project. No images are being sold. Pledges go into materials, paying models, and renting space and equipment and fulfilling perks. </p>
<p>The output of this project is a set of high quality, stylized images, and a brief video featuring the models in motion. No copyrighted music will be used in this video, so sorry, no soundtrack music from the movie.</p>
<p>I'm starting this thing off extremely modest, and as Indiegogo takes a good chunk as do perks, all perks will be modest unless the project is funded beyond 100%. </p>
<p><strong>Who is Uryaen?</strong></p>
<p>Qualifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with <a href=""http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,76281/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video game design</a>, web design, and software development.</li>
<li>Experience in product evaluation, with an emphasis on technology such as computer parts.</li>

<li>Photography, videography, visual effects ( <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200493/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">movies </a>) and photo manipulation.</li>

<li>For a real world view of my varied abilities, look no further than uryaen.com itself.</li>
</ul><div>
<p><strong><a href=""http://uryaen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uryaen.com</a> and Indiegogo: </strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://uryaen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uryaen.com</a> is hoping Indiegogo users will love the idea enough to fund the various levels of perks we have planned. We'll go over that in a moment, but first; let's break down how funds are to be used.</p>
<p><strong>How Funds are used:</strong></p>
<p>All funds go directly into the acquisition of costumes, which are being designed and created especially for me, the studio rental space, paying Make Up Artists, possibly paying the models if we get enough, and some extra materials and supplies this shoot needs. The more we get, the better the props, etc!</p>
<p>The project as set up will fund the perks for the shoot, and that's pretty much it. I'm keeping the perk levels fairly modest, but if we go levels above that, I'll offer new, higher tier perks!</p>
<p><strong>What if we go above the 100% goal?</strong></p>
<p>Might as well answer this here. For additional funding, which I highly encourage, we'll have the chance to do a number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay the models, because they deserve it!</li>
<li>Pay an additional Make up or hair artist or two, to add to the overall quality level of the shoot.</li>
<li>Purchase additional quality props like swords and guns and the other crafted bits that make it more special.</li>
<li>Possibly higher quality lenses, and lighting gear, sky is the limit!</li>
<li>Higher tier perks .</li>
<li>Possibly other bonuses, let's see how it goes. </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>Perks </strong></p>
<p>The fun stuff!</p>
<p>The perks section isn't big enough to hold all of the goodness we're offering, so here is a breakdown of the actual perks , including the truly special stuff for the big pledges:</p>
<p><strong>Perk Level $1</strong></p>
<p>You get to be part of the project and I'll send you an email the moment the image set is released online. You'll get to be among the first to view them!</p>
<p><strong>Perk Level $5</strong></p>
<p>A download link to the full set of images. I'll be releasing a set of images for free online but only pledges this tier and above get the full set. I promise there will be some nice exclusives in there. </p>
<p><strong>Perk Level $25</strong></p>
<p>Access to an exclusive ""Extended Edition"" video, with extra material not seen in the released version.</p>
<p>If the project meets the $2500 mark, I'll add a ""Behind the Scenes"" sequence filmed by a second production shooter, complete with Make up, bloopers, set up, and other surprises. This tier will gain access to this video.</p>
<p><strong>Perk Level $75</strong></p>
<p>For this tier, I will do a short run of 8.5x11 or so prints, and have a model sign one. You will receive this print once everything is produced, and I can schedule the model to sign it. Prints will be on basic photo paper. If higher tiers of funding are achieved, I will look into higher quality prints. </p>
<p>I'm limiting the run of these to add to their exclusivity. There will ONLY be ONE image of a solo model per model and ONE set of all five in a run of five. That's a total of TEN printed and signed photos so get there fast!</p>
<p>Which image will you get? Sorry, that's for me to decide. </p>
<p>Shipping is extra, as I cannot control where the perk goes and final shipping cost to be determined by print size.   </p>
<p><strong>Perk Level $250</strong></p>
<p>For this tier, I will do a short run of 8.5x11 or so prints, and have all five models sign each. You will receive this print once everything is produced, and I can schedule the models to sign it. If higher tiers of funding are achieved, I will look into higher quality prints. </p>
<p>I'm limiting the run of these to add to their exclusivity. There will ONLY be ONE set of all five in a run of ten. That's a total of TEN printed and signed photos so get there fast! This set is unique from the previous set. </p>
<p>Which image will you get? Sorry, that's for me to decide. </p>
<p>Shipping is extra, as I cannot control where the perk goes and final shipping cost to be determined by print size.</p>
<p><strong>Perk Level $250 International and Digital Friendly Package</strong></p>
<p>Want something special but don't want to bother with shipping? For this tier, I will do a special set of images and a video with Backer Only content. You get everything in the lower tiers, as far as exclusive images, and you get a special thank you video from all of us</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals!!</strong></p>
<p>I'm starting small, but here is how I see the breakdown if new tiers of funding are achieved:</p>
<p>If funding reaches:</p>
<p><strong>$1250</strong></p>
<p>I will add a real replica Babydoll sword, instead of the plastic one we're currently set to use.</p>
<p><strong>$1500</strong></p>
<p>I will rent a higher quality, low F-Stop lens, to increase the quality of the shoot.</p>
<p>I will add a few bits and pieces to the costumes to increase accuracy.</p>
<p>I will add a second MUA ( Make Up Artist ) to increase the quality of the shoot. </p>
<p><strong>$2500</strong></p>
<p>I will hire a second video shooter to document parts of the shoot, including Make up, behind the shooting, bloopers, etc. </p>
<p>A new Perk bonus will be added for $25 and above perk tiers to access this content.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, this stretch goal only requires 60 $25 backers to hit. We can do that! We can do better than that!</p>
<p><strong>$5000</strong></p>
<p>If the project really takes off, I'll add a second day of shooting, on location outside, for some action shots and video sequences in full costume. </p>
<p>I will add a new perk tier - $500, and those backers will receive ONE piece of the props. This may include goggles, fake lollipop, or whatever other bits we have. This will NOT include the weapons, as there may be shipping regulations to worry about, or the costumes. This tier will be extremely limited, and may go FAST. </p>
<p>I will also add an additional bonus pay to each model, because they work hard. Don't worry, it'll be worth their time. </p>
<p><strong>$10000</strong></p>
<p>For this tier, I'll do one additional day of shooting, and add a new HIGHLY exclusive perk tier: $1000. For this plus shipping, I will send you one randomly selected full backup costume from the shoot. This costume will not have been worn, as that would be inappropriate, but it will be an exact duplicate of one of our costumes. </p>
<p>Shipping will be extra and TBD.</p>
<p>At this tier I'll be able to hugely increase the overall quality of the lighting by using a full set of Paul C Buff lights. </p>
<p>Depending on costume and model availability, I might be able to do a Wise Man or maybe Steampunk Nazi's. If things get higher, I'll just keep adding content!! </p>
<p>I may have some other surprises up my sleeve if we hit this stretch goal. </p>
<p>Can there be stretch goals beyond this? You bet. I have many ideas, ( better lighting, additional characters from the movie ) but let's hit this one before we really talk about those . . .</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for viewing, and if you think it's a great idea, toss in a few bucks. If this thing takes off, I'll update with possible new tiers and perks. </p>

</div></div>","Uryaen, photograper founder of uryaen.com is doing an EPIC Sucker Punch Cosplay Shoot. This photography shoot will involve the following characters: Babydoll - played by Elora, the model you see in the picture above Sweet Pea - Played by AbbyRocket - Played by TBD Amber - Played by Lin Blondie - Played by TBD but tentatively filled
Here, ""TBD"" means that I have at least a few candidates but I may not have chosen the final casting yet. Rest assured there are several viable candidates for these roles, and I'm in the process of test shooting and choosing the final one. 
Depending on the level of funding the project receives, I may add the Wise Man and other bonuses.

I'll be adding images from the first Babydoll test shoot really soon, but wanted to go ahead and get this launched now. 
For a special look at the first test shoot, see the images below, or find the full size images on my site at www.uryaen.com. 
This shoot will happen even if the project isn't funded. How many projects promise you that? The main difference is whether we get to see some of neat upgrades to it that I have planned, and the perks. So pledge with confidence! This is purely a fun project, and not a ""for profit"" project. No images are being sold. Pledges go into materials, paying models, and renting space and equipment and fulfilling perks. 
The output of this project is a set of high quality, stylized images, and a brief video featuring the models in motion. No copyrighted music will be used in this video, so sorry, no soundtrack music from the movie.
I'm starting this thing off extremely modest, and as Indiegogo takes a good chunk as do perks, all perks will be modest unless the project is funded beyond 100%. 
Who is Uryaen?
Qualifications include:

Experience with video game design, web design, and software development.
Experience in product evaluation, with an emphasis on technology such as computer parts.
Published writer since 1989, with articles in national print magazines as recently as 2010. ( HD3D article in GameFan Magazine, PDF available )
Photography, videography, visual effects ( movies ) and photo manipulation.
Recognized expert and contributor to the toy industry, with a line of custom Nerf Guns on a separate blog with 57k views and my own entry on the worlds most viewed toy blog.
For a real world view of my varied abilities, look no further than uryaen.com itself.

uryaen.com and Indiegogo: 
uryaen.com is hoping Indiegogo users will love the idea enough to fund the various levels of perks we have planned. We'll go over that in a moment, but first; let's break down how funds are to be used.
How Funds are used:
All funds go directly into the acquisition of costumes, which are being designed and created especially for me, the studio rental space, paying Make Up Artists, possibly paying the models if we get enough, and some extra materials and supplies this shoot needs. The more we get, the better the props, etc!
The project as set up will fund the perks for the shoot, and that's pretty much it. I'm keeping the perk levels fairly modest, but if we go levels above that, I'll offer new, higher tier perks!
What if we go above the 100% goal?
Might as well answer this here. For additional funding, which I highly encourage, we'll have the chance to do a number of things:

Pay the models, because they deserve it!
Pay an additional Make up or hair artist or two, to add to the overall quality level of the shoot.
Purchase additional quality props like swords and guns and the other crafted bits that make it more special.
Possibly higher quality lenses, and lighting gear, sky is the limit!
Higher tier perks .
Possibly other bonuses, let's see how it goes. 


Perks 
The fun stuff!
The perks section isn't big enough to hold all of the goodness we're offering, so here is a breakdown of the actual perks , including the truly special stuff for the big pledges:
Perk Level $1
You get to be part of the project and I'll send you an email the moment the image set is released online. You'll get to be among the first to view them!
Perk Level $5
A download link to the full set of images. I'll be releasing a set of images for free online but only pledges this tier and above get the full set. I promise there will be some nice exclusives in there. 
Perk Level $25
Access to an exclusive ""Extended Edition"" video, with extra material not seen in the released version.
If the project meets the $2500 mark, I'll add a ""Behind the Scenes"" sequence filmed by a second production shooter, complete with Make up, bloopers, set up, and other surprises. This tier will gain access to this video.
Perk Level $75
For this tier, I will do a short run of 8.5x11 or so prints, and have a model sign one. You will receive this print once everything is produced, and I can schedule the model to sign it. Prints will be on basic photo paper. If higher tiers of funding are achieved, I will look into higher quality prints. 
I'm limiting the run of these to add to their exclusivity. There will ONLY be ONE image of a solo model per model and ONE set of all five in a run of five. That's a total of TEN printed and signed photos so get there fast!
Which image will you get? Sorry, that's for me to decide. 
Shipping is extra, as I cannot control where the perk goes and final shipping cost to be determined by print size.   
Perk Level $250
For this tier, I will do a short run of 8.5x11 or so prints, and have all five models sign each. You will receive this print once everything is produced, and I can schedule the models to sign it. If higher tiers of funding are achieved, I will look into higher quality prints. 
I'm limiting the run of these to add to their exclusivity. There will ONLY be ONE set of all five in a run of ten. That's a total of TEN printed and signed photos so get there fast! This set is unique from the previous set. 
Which image will you get? Sorry, that's for me to decide. 
Shipping is extra, as I cannot control where the perk goes and final shipping cost to be determined by print size.
Perk Level $250 International and Digital Friendly Package
Want something special but don't want to bother with shipping? For this tier, I will do a special set of images and a video with Backer Only content. You get everything in the lower tiers, as far as exclusive images, and you get a special thank you video from all of us
Stretch Goals!!
I'm starting small, but here is how I see the breakdown if new tiers of funding are achieved:
If funding reaches:
$1250
I will add a real replica Babydoll sword, instead of the plastic one we're currently set to use.
$1500
I will rent a higher quality, low F-Stop lens, to increase the quality of the shoot.
I will add a few bits and pieces to the costumes to increase accuracy.
I will add a second MUA ( Make Up Artist ) to increase the quality of the shoot. 
$2500
I will hire a second video shooter to document parts of the shoot, including Make up, behind the shooting, bloopers, etc. 
A new Perk bonus will be added for $25 and above perk tiers to access this content.
To put this in perspective, this stretch goal only requires 60 $25 backers to hit. We can do that! We can do better than that!
$5000
If the project really takes off, I'll add a second day of shooting, on location outside, for some action shots and video sequences in full costume. 
I will add a new perk tier - $500, and those backers will receive ONE piece of the props. This may include goggles, fake lollipop, or whatever other bits we have. This will NOT include the weapons, as there may be shipping regulations to worry about, or the costumes. This tier will be extremely limited, and may go FAST. 
I will also add an additional bonus pay to each model, because they work hard. Don't worry, it'll be worth their time. 
$10000
For this tier, I'll do one additional day of shooting, and add a new HIGHLY exclusive perk tier: $1000. For this plus shipping, I will send you one randomly selected full backup costume from the shoot. This costume will not have been worn, as that would be inappropriate, but it will be an exact duplicate of one of our costumes. 
Shipping will be extra and TBD.
At this tier I'll be able to hugely increase the overall quality of the lighting by using a full set of Paul C Buff lights. 
Depending on costume and model availability, I might be able to do a Wise Man or maybe Steampunk Nazi's. If things get higher, I'll just keep adding content!! 
I may have some other surprises up my sleeve if we hit this stretch goal. 
Can there be stretch goals beyond this? You bet. I have many ideas, ( better lighting, additional characters from the movie ) but let's hit this one before we really talk about those . . .
Conclusion
Thank you for viewing, and if you think it's a great idea, toss in a few bucks. If this thing takes off, I'll update with possible new tiers and perks.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

to stand alone, in their own right, for others to enjoy. This is a chance to

<p><i><strong>Have you every looked at a turd and thought ""Wow!  That looks just like a bratwurst!""?  No? You haven't? Really!?!?  Well we have!  And because we're a little bit not right, we took that turd, put it on a bun and served it up with a beer for the month of September.  Get your copy to see the rest of the year!</strong></i></p>
<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
<p>This all began over 15 years ago with two best friends and a little dog named Jake, who's turds looked like breakfast sausage.  One day, while on a road trip, the two friends came up with an idea to, just for a goof, prepare a special breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast and ""sausage"", take a picture and send it to a sister.  Well the sister thought it was hilarious, and the idea for a calendar full of poop on a plate was born!  We kicked it around for more than 15 years and finally decided that, at the end of the day, it's darned funny and that we should share it with the rest of the world. </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We're just two middle-aged women who still find poop funny.  Fortunately, one of us married a professional photographer who also thinks poop is hilarious.  Together, the three of us have created a full year of mouth-watering photographs and assembled them into this beautiful calendar.</p>
<p>While we'd really love for our children to inherit a fortune built on a poop empire ('cuz...American dream, right?), we're really only trying to see this years-long idea through and share it with all of you who appreciate a little silly humor.</p>
<h3>But...WHY?</h3>
<p>There really is no good reason, except that it's just funny.  Here's a list of some of the people who have said so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmer Joe</li>
<li>The lady at the county clerks office who helped us get a business license</li>
<li>The woman at the post office who helped us set up our P.O. Box</li>
<li>My cousin Cheri</li>
<li>Ramona from work</li>
<li>The nice guys at the box store who helped us sort out our shipping needs</li>
<li>Kate's mom</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of presenting both sides...the following people do NOT think it's funny at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lady at the bank who opened our business account</li>
<li>Every telemarketer who calls us and has to say the business name out loud</li>
<li>Tim</li>
</ul>
<p>*Kimberly's dad is on the fence, but he's leaning toward funny.</p>
<h3>We Do Have Standards</h3>
<p>Here are a few important facts you should know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We ONLY use animal poop.  Human poop will NEVER be an option. </li>
<li>That's gross.No animals are EVER harmed in the production of this calendar.</li>
<li>We do not modify the specimens in any way.  We use it as we find it, with the exception of occasionally slicing it.</li>
<li>No Mom, you can NOT send us homemade samples.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $2500 for the initial print run of the calendar.  For being one of our backers, you'll get a great deal on your very own copy!  This is a time-sensitive project, as we need to be able to start shipping in November to make sure you have them in time for the holidays and the new year.</p>
<ul>
<li>All funds raised will be put toward printing and shipping costs.</li>
<li>Exciting perks and deals for helping us out!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal...you will still get your calendar!  If we exceed our goal, we'll print more calendars and start working on the 2018 edition.  We also have a greeting card line in the works!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There really are no risks to you.  It's simple.  You donate, we send you your stuff. </p>
<p>As far as challenges, we have already overcome all of those.  For example, there was a really mean duck at the farm that did NOT want us near the poop.  We won...with no harm to the duck, but it was definitely a challenge.  You may not realize all that went into this project.  For example, where does one get all that poop?  Have you ever thought about where it would be stored until the photo shoot?  How about not gagging as you serve it up?  What happens when you can't find any rubber gloves and the perfect turd is right there...just daring you?  How do you ever eat spaghetti again after that?</p>

<p>HELLO FRIENDS. I am reaching out to my community of dreamers, makers, advocates, and wild-hearted humans who believe as I do, that whatever makes your life beautiful, is essential. Please share this with the people in your world too. I am so grateful for your support.</p>

<p><strong>story. </strong></p>
<p>Photography is a memorial art, retelling our stories and framing our joys and our losses. I want my images to be an honest account of the imperfect perfectness, the letting go, the yes of it all. The forever of a single moment. An act of love.</p>
<p>In the hurriedness of my days, I am attempting what feels like the impossible - to show up for my life and for my craft in a new way.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>your gift.</strong></p>
<p>My business has grown a lot in the last few years, but I have been limited by not having the capital to build an infrastructure (a foundation of using the right technology, in the right moment, in the right space, with resources available to me when I need them),  or to invest in the equipment that I need to truly grow into the photographer that I hope to be (a faster camera, lenses that allow me flexibility and balance in my shooting, and other equipment that will mean more creative freedom). </p>
<p>Your support will allow my business to thrive, to have continuity, to further partner with individuals, educators and organizations that are doing amazing things in this world, and identify ways to give back to the communities that I work with. </p>
<p>Please note that any amount at all can be given. It does not need to be the amount listed under the perks section. </p>
<p><strong>the impact.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>I want and need the work that I do, with both children and adults, to cultivate connection, and a sense of self-acceptance and self-sanctuary. The impact of your contribution is sharing in that truth. When I give back, it is the people who supported me during this journey giving back too. Thank you so much.</p>

</div></div>","HELLO FRIENDS. I am reaching out to my community of dreamers, makers, advocates, and wild-hearted humans who believe as I do, that whatever makes your life beautiful, is essential. Please share this with the people in your world too. I am so grateful for your support.
 
story. 
Photography is a memorial art, retelling our stories and framing our joys and our losses. I want my images to be an honest account of the imperfect perfectness, the letting go, the yes of it all. The forever of a single moment. An act of love.
In the hurriedness of my days, I am attempting what feels like the impossible - to show up for my life and for my craft in a new way.

your gift.
My business has grown a lot in the last few years, but I have been limited by not having the capital to build an infrastructure (a foundation of using the right technology, in the right moment, in the right space, with resources available to me when I need them),  or to invest in the equipment that I need to truly grow into the photographer that I hope to be (a faster camera, lenses that allow me flexibility and balance in my shooting, and other equipment that will mean more creative freedom). 
Your support will allow my business to thrive, to have continuity, to further partner with individuals, educators and organizations that are doing amazing things in this world, and identify ways to give back to the communities that I work with. 
Please note that any amount at all can be given. It does not need to be the amount listed under the perks section. 
the impact.

I want and need the work that I do, with both children and adults, to cultivate connection, and a sense of self-acceptance and self-sanctuary. The impact of your contribution is sharing in that truth. When I give back, it is the people who supported me during this journey giving back too. Thank you so much.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Die Fotografie eine Leidenschaft!</strong></p>
<p>Hallo ich bin Happy Berry und bereits 23 Jahre alt und komme aus Leipzig , ja aus dem wundervollen Leipzig wo auch die Buchmesse ihr Zuhause hat.</p>
<p>Da fing damals alles an .. ja die Buchmesse , damals war ich noch Cosplayerin und locker 50 Kilo leichter xD ich liebte es vor der Kamera zu stehen und mich Ablichten zulassen .. nur merkte ich schnell das die damaligen Fotografen nichts auf dem Kasten hatten und sich einen "" Dreck"" um ihre Modele gekümmert hatten ... nach ein paar Jahren und einer Freundin die ich wirklich oft damals ""Geknipst "" hatte , sagte sie mir ... das ich echt paar gute Winkel drauf habe und auf die kleinsten dinge achte und da fing ich an das Cosplayen an den Nagel zu hängen und mein Herz endgültig der Fotografie  zu schenken.</p>
<p>Was alles so leicht klingt und alles so schnell ... naja das dauerte gut 4 Jahre bis ich mich dazu entschloss eine bessere Kamera zu Kaufen .</p>
<p>Ich hatte allerdings nie viel Geld und naja meine familiären Umstände waren nie so gut. Ich musste eine menge Steine aus dem Weg Räumen um an eine ordentliche Kamera zu kommen und um meinem Traum "" Ich will die allerbeste sein..."" ein bisschen näher zu kommen.</p>
<p>Darauf folgte ein Jahr im Üben, jeden Menschen vor die Kamera zu ziehen, wieder viele Menschen von denen ich Hass abbekam und abneigung.. Viele Freunde gingen neue freunde kamen. Wieder viele Steine und Geröll aus dem Weg räumen um das zu tun was ich so Liebte und das mir half mit meinen Problemen klar zu kommen.. es lenkte mich ab , ich versteckte mich hinter der Kamera , hinter dem Namen ""Happy Berry"" , mitlerweile.. ist es nicht mehr nur ein Name .. Mittlerweile kennt man mich und das war wirklich nicht Leicht., mittlerweile bin ich in der Ausbildung zum Fotografen, habe eine wundervolle Beziehung und einfach super tolle Freunde die nicht einfach so gehen wenn es mal schwierig wird oder auch mal Probleme verstehen und mir Helfen!</p>
<p>Wie ihr Lest oder auch nicht , bin ich nicht einer der Fotografen die damit Geld verdienen wollen oder Anerkennung haben wollen! Für mich ist es KUNST! Meine Auslebung , flucht aus dem Alltag und ein bisschen Kopf abschalten.</p>
<p>Deswegen ist mir diese Kampagne auch so extrem wichtig, ich stehe vor einem Problem , ich bin 2 Lehrjahr , kaum verdienst alles mache ich nebenbei... alles Kostenlos . Ich brauche daher eure Hilfe für meine nächsten Projekte die groß werden etwas Geld zusammen zu kratzen .</p>
<p>Daher habe ich mit großartigen Cosplayern dieses Jahr daran gesessen 3 Kalender euch anbieten zu können!</p>
<p>Alle in A3 Größe in den Kategorien :</p>
<p>-Cosplay</p>
<p>-Fantasy , Fabelwesen, Gijinkas</p>
<p>-Fashion</p>
<p>oder 13x18 Prints</p>
<p>Sowie Poster in 30x40 mit verschiedenen Motiven , vielleicht auch von euren Lieblingen ;)</p>
<p>Es geht mir nicht darum um mit dem Geld was bei raus kommt , mir nen Fetten zu machen und in den Urlaub fliegen zu können ... <strong>NEIN</strong>! Ich brauche nur Unterstützung .</p>
<p><u>Was ihr bewirkt? Neue großartige Projekte mit vielen Modelen... wenn euch meine Seite oder sogar ich euch als Mensch viel bedeute ... bitte Unterstütz meine Modele und mich dabei , noch krassere Sachen zu Planen und umzusetzen</u></p>
<p>Happy Berry ist ungern die 0815 Fotografin um die Ecke, sie will DIE Fotografin werden und dafür Opfere ich meine Freizeit und großteils die Zeit mit meinem Freund... Urlaube die ich hätte schon längst machen können und Conventions zu denen ich hätte fahren können.</p>
<p>Ich Stecke <strong>jedes </strong>Geld was ich irgendwie über habe .. da rein und das können alle meine Modele bestätigen, sei es ein neuer HG bei mir zu Hause , ein neuer Nebler oder eine neue Kamera ( danke meine Freunde) besten Einfälle.</p>

The smaller event like job fairs, food pantries, fund raisers, and river cleanups improves our quality of life.</p><p>As a self-unemployed (employed on paid assignment, unemployed between assignments) I was only able to cover some of the many people,  events, protests and news stories that took place in the last three decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.  The challenge for me was to show through photographs and stories the essence of those thirty very important years.  I hope you agree and make this book possible.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566709722/dfav0zzdqwitd1unwtnq.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><h3> </h3></div>","Growing with AtlantaAtlanta Through My Lens: The Photography of Ron Sherman is my fifth hardcover book since my arrival in Atlanta in 1971.  Two of the four books were sponsored by Atlanta Organizations, the Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development Commissions and the other two by publishers.  These book assignments allowed me to create a collection of Atlanta photos that helped build my extensive photo archives.My current book is about the people and events that made this city what it is today.  Most other Atlanta books are basically travel guides, including my first four.

I arrived in Atlanta in 1971 and in 1972 ceased publishing its weekly magazine. Then it was plan ‘B’.  I had connected with the UPI wire service while in college and they welcomed me in the Atlanta Bureau as a stringer.  I also made contacts with Life, Newsweek, Time, and Business Week and started getting assignments from them.  There were also organizations like Volunteer Atlanta and the Boys Club looking for help marketing their services, so I volunteered for them.Stock photography are photographs either done on assignment or self-assignment that are collected, organized and captioned by photographers, who then market these images to publications, advertisers and other potential users.  Some photographers find a stock photo agent to license their images, so they can keep on making photos while someone else distributes them. My first agent started to represent me in 1964 and I continued to have an agent until 2005.  Over the years, I have built up an archive of over 500,000 black and white and color negatives, transparencies and prints.  About half represent my collection of Atlanta subjectsThe Atlanta Through My Lens hard cover book will feature photographs of famous and not so famous people. On my volunteer photo assignments, I found many of the individuals I documented may have had ordinary jobs, but they were extraordinary people.  Atlanta Festivals allows us to see through the dance, songs, dress and food the variety of cultures that live in our city.  The large events like the Super Bowl, National Conventions, and the Olympics gave Atlanta national and International exposure. The smaller event like job fairs, food pantries, fund raisers, and river cleanups improves our quality of life.As a self-unemployed (employed on paid assignment, unemployed between assignments) I was only able to cover some of the many people,  events, protests and news stories that took place in the last three decades of the 20th century.  The challenge for me was to show through photographs and stories the essence of those thirty very important years.  I hope you agree and make this book possible.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of Photography students studying in our final year at the University of Hertfordshire. The Apex Exhibition will be the last collaborative work as a group and will promote our photographic work in the heart of London at the Old Truman Brewery, Brick Lane. </p>
<p>Donations and contributors will help us realise this opportunity in showcasing in the Big City and pay for the venue, as well as all the delights of drinks for the ""big night"". </p>
<p>All contributors are invited to the Apex Exhibition, running from 28th June - 3rd July 2018. (Located: 2nd Room, Bottom Floor, The Old Truman Brewery, Brick Lane)</p>
<p>Opening Night: 28th June 6pm - 10pm</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to raise £3,000 in total to pay for the gallery space and the refreshments for the showcase, in order to make our night as successful and your night as enjoyable as possible. </p>
<p>We will also be using the money to print posters, postcards, flyers and stickers to put in the exhibition. They will all be available for you to take as a souvenir. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As Final Year students, this is the last and most important exhibition of our photographic career so far, as potential employers and clients are attending the showcase. This creates a lot of pressure on us to assure that our full potential is realised because ""first impressions"" do count! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are risks in all projects involving money and donations, although the biggest hurdle we face is not making enough money to pay for the exhibition space.</p>
<p>This, however, can be overcome by fundraising more around the university grounds and the surrounding towns of St. Albans and Hatfield Town Centre, in order to get the local people involved in the donations.

<h3 align=""center"">We raised money through fundraisers and partnerships, but we need $2500 more!</h3>
<h3 align=""center"">Support a good cause now and help us turn this dream into reality!</h3>
<p align=""center""><em>“We live in a global community and our care and concern for others often finds us helping in places far from home. We are a nation known for our compassionate and generous people and we make a difference in the world. Humanitarians give freely to those in need. They ask little for themselves and they bring comfort and relief wherever possible. Documenting these acts of care and kindness is a valuable tribute to those who experience the uncertainties of altruism, when they leave the safety and security of our land for often hostile and dangerous places. Our London connection to those serving abroad will create a tangible link to the challenges they face and the changes they make.”  <strong>Honourable Joe Fontana – Mayor of London, Ontario, Canada</strong></em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>The HUMANitarians</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em><strong><span>the Faces, the Places, the Challenges</span></strong></em></p>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong><strong>What is The HUMANitarians?</strong></p>
<p><span>The HUMANitarians is an idea we strongly believe in. It is a recurring dream and careful planning of years. It is a <em><strong>photographic documentary</strong></em> initiative about the human side of voluntary work. It is about feelings, fears and emotions. It is about situational, cultural and personal challenges. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p><span>Relief work makes it into the media mainly on the basis of crisis situations. But as much as you hear about the circumstances, little is mentioned about the people who face danger and adversity to help others. It rarely makes the headlines, although the functionality of providing assistance would not be possible without the dedication of field staff.</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to give a little credit where credit is deserved and shed some light into the backstage darkness of voluntary medical support. By presenting a different angle to humanitarian work, we aspire to raise awareness and recognition, while honoring the tremendous effort that goes into providing aid. Featuring impressive photographs, personal stories and interviews from the field operations we will pursue compassion and pay tribute to the personalities behind the scenes.</span></p>

<p><strong>What is your part?</strong> </p>
<p><span>We invite you to dream our dream with us and be a part of something truly majestic. Something that <em><strong>is</strong> </em>good, <em><strong>feels</strong> </em>good and <em><strong>does</strong> </em>good. With your contribution we can bring forward the human elements of such inhumane circumstances and show support to the supporters. </span></p>
<p><span>With your gracious generosity we can visit three different geographical locations to offer regionally and culturally diverse context. Emergency assistance is needed in cases of armed </span>conflict, natural disaster, epidemic and health-care exclusion. To deliver insight from these areas, we focus on the regions of West Africa, North India and South-East Asia. Our three-month journey begins at the end of November and we will be steeped in the day-to-day realities beside the field crews.</p>

<p><strong><span>What do we need and what do we offer?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We need <em><strong>$19,000</strong></em> to cover the costs of travel and research.</span> We want to do something important. We do not intend to build a house or fly to the moon. We promise that every pledged penny will go towards getting us there and back and getting you as many pictures and stories as possible. The funding for The HUMANitarians - after having paid all the fees - will be used for travel costs (i.e. flights and local transportation), for personal and gear insurances and for food and accommodation. We have modest needs, modest expenses, but big dreams. </p>
<p><span>We would like to honor your philanthropy by offering unique gifts for believing in us and our dream including archival quality prints, copies of our previous book, recognition and a whole lot of gratitude.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What if...?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>If we surpass our goal? We fly to the moon... Ok, maybe not, but we will get closer to having the material published and being able to offer it to the charity organizations we work with for fundraising and recruiting purposes. </span></p>
<p><span>If you can't afford to contribute financially, your support is still needed and highly valued. Please assist us in spreading the word and <em><strong>make some noise</strong></em> to get the ball rolling!</span></p>

<p> </p></div>","ONLY $2,500 MORE!!! 
 
We raised money through fundraisers and partnerships, but we need $2500 more!
Support a good cause now and help us turn this dream into reality!
“We live in a global community and our care and concern for others often finds us helping in places far from home. We are a nation known for our compassionate and generous people and we make a difference in the world. Humanitarians give freely to those in need. They ask little for themselves and they bring comfort and relief wherever possible. Documenting these acts of care and kindness is a valuable tribute to those who experience the uncertainties of altruism, when they leave the safety and security of our land for often hostile and dangerous places. Our London connection to those serving abroad will create a tangible link to the challenges they face and the changes they make.”  Honourable Joe Fontana – Mayor of London, Ontario, Canada
The HUMANitarians
the Faces, the Places, the Challenges
 What is The HUMANitarians?
The HUMANitarians is an idea we strongly believe in. It is a recurring dream and careful planning of years. It is a photographic documentary initiative about the human side of voluntary work. It is about feelings, fears and emotions. It is about situational, cultural and personal challenges. 
Why?
Relief work makes it into the media mainly on the basis of crisis situations. But as much as you hear about the circumstances, little is mentioned about the people who face danger and adversity to help others. It rarely makes the headlines, although the functionality of providing assistance would not be possible without the dedication of field staff.
We would like to give a little credit where credit is deserved and shed some light into the backstage darkness of voluntary medical support. By presenting a different angle to humanitarian work, we aspire to raise awareness and recognition, while honoring the tremendous effort that goes into providing aid. Featuring impressive photographs, personal stories and interviews from the field operations we will pursue compassion and pay tribute to the personalities behind the scenes.

What is your part? 
We invite you to dream our dream with us and be a part of something truly majestic. Something that is good, feels good and does good. With your contribution we can bring forward the human elements of such inhumane circumstances and show support to the supporters. 
With your gracious generosity we can visit three different geographical locations to offer regionally and culturally diverse context. Emergency assistance is needed in cases of armed conflict, natural disaster, epidemic and health-care exclusion. To deliver insight from these areas, we focus on the regions of West Africa, North India and South-East Asia. Our three-month journey begins at the end of November and we will be steeped in the day-to-day realities beside the field crews.

Who are we?
Juozas is a Canadian artist who has received his BFA from Concordia University in Montreal, and his MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He is a professional photographer passionate about showing the shadows not just the colors.
Anita is a Hungarian economist, a graduate of Oxford Brookes University (Budapest). She is in constant search of information about people, stories, motivations, thoughts and feelings to find the good in the world.
Together, we run Forward Factory, a web-based enterprise where art and adventure meet charity. It is a forward thinking concept about an artistic approach to providing information, traveling responsibly while helping devotedly.

What do we need and what do we offer?
We need $19,000 to cover the costs of travel and research. We want to do something important. We do not intend to build a house or fly to the moon. We promise that every pledged penny will go towards getting us there and back and getting you as many pictures and stories as possible. The funding for The HUMANitarians - after having paid all the fees - will be used for travel costs (i.e. flights and local transportation), for personal and gear insurances and for food and accommodation. We have modest needs, modest expenses, but big dreams. 
We would like to honor your philanthropy by offering unique gifts for believing in us and our dream including archival quality prints, copies of our previous book, recognition and a whole lot of gratitude.
What if...?

If we surpass our goal? We fly to the moon... Ok, maybe not, but we will get closer to having the material published and being able to offer it to the charity organizations we work with for fundraising and recruiting purposes. 
If you can't afford to contribute financially, your support is still needed and highly valued. Please assist us in spreading the word and make some noise to get the ball rolling!
WE APPRECIATE YOUR HELP TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

<p class=""p1"">The harmony between them starts instantly but being respectively the teacher and a participant they have to wait until the show is over, from then on they are inseparable.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Dixie Ramone</p>
<p class=""p1"">After many years of dance training and driven by a great passion for music and performing arts, she studies at the Academy of the Art of Burlesque of the Micca Club of Rome, cradle of the industry in Italy, she becomes its teacher and raises newcomers now well known on an international level. She is one of the first Italians to perform on international stages: Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, Dusseldorf, New York, and more.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In 2011 she takes part, in the role of teacher, in the first talent show about burlesque “Lady Burlesque”, on air on Sky Uno TV in prime time for ten weeks; the same year following the wave of this success she is the first Italian performer to participate in and win the “Dixie Evans Burlesque Festival” in Las Vegas and the first to partake in the New York Burlesque Festival where she is by now at home.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In 2012, after being assigned the lifetime achievement award during the Catania Film Festival, she sets another record being the first Italian to take part in the Perth International Burlesque Festival and its tour in Western Australia. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In 2013 she wins the 8<sup>th</sup> edition of the Rome Burlesque Festival which happens every year at the Micca Club.</p>
<p class=""p2""> Albadoro Gala</p>
<p class=""p1"">The typical screenplay where the main character goes with her friend to an audition and she gets selected instead!</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is how the burlesque kidnaps Albadoro during the talent show “Lady Burlesque”, pulling her out from her business woman life made of grey suits.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From then on she performs in the best clubs in Italy and Europe, takes part in the Fish &amp; Whips Contest in Berlin and in the Milan Burlesque Award in 2012 and with Dixie goes to the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of the New York Burlesque Festival. In 2013 she wins the Best Classic award during the Munich Burlesque Festival.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">They start to tour the world together between international clubs and festivals, first as separate artists and then giving life to “The Missunderstanding”.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Missunderstanding is a whimsical duo and after a few weeks from its life it is selected for the Milan Burlesque Award 2013.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the duo is not just about art: the experience of the first and the entrepreneurship of the latter bring the two ambitious performers to be determined to create and produce events, but especially to give back to this ancient art the prestige that it deserves, contributing to the building up of a burlesque community in Italy like it exists in the rest of the world and bringing the Italian burlesque scene to an international level.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is where the idea of producing the “Eternal Beauty” 2014 calendar comes from, with the aim of portraying the burlesque scene of Rome.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A comparison between the eternal beauty of the city of Rome and the fleeting one of its performers, between the austerity of its artistic patrimony and the frivolousness of burlesque, between the urban folklore and the glamour of the proscenioum.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The subject of every shot will be a performer and a roman view; from hidden corners of the capital to sights that are by now famous all over the world, highlighted by the splendor of the protagonists.</p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the experiences that Dixie and Albadoro shared was modeling for the 2013 calendar “Girls and Legendary US Cars” by the german photographer Carlos Kella, produced by Sway Books.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Carlos Kella is a photographer based in Hamburg. His passion for photography became his profession in 2007, after 20 years of work in the field of art buying, consulting and production for the advertising industry. </p>
<p class=""p1"">His artistic works are dominated by american cars of the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's combined with feminine beauty, a combination that portrays the power of women through their beauty, elegance and irony.</p>
<p class=""p1"">He met Dixie and Albadoro during his shootings for his 2013 calendar ""Girls &amp; Legendary US cars"" for which they posed as models.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Some of his books and calendar publications include:</p>
<p class=""p1"">Coffeetablebook „Private Arrangements Part 1“ (2007)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Postcardbook „Erotic to go“ (2008)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Coffeetablebook „Model-Edition Vol. 1“ (2008)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Coffeetablebook „Model-Edition Vol. 2“ (2009)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Weekly calendar „Girls &amp; legendary US-Cars“ (2009 - 2013 every year)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Monthly calendar „Burton on the Road“ (2011, 2012, 2013)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Monthly calendar „Gents &amp; legendary US-Cars“ (2013)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Coffeetablebook „Photos, Love &amp; Stories.“ (2012)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Monthly calendar „Queen Calavera - The Home of Burlesque“ (2013)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Postcardbook „SAY IT SWAY“ (2013)</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">""Eternal Beauty"" is a new and challenging project for him, and he has embraced it with his typical enthusiasm and passion,  characteristics that make Carlos unique and a real pleasure to work with.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We, The Missunderstanding, have chose Carlos as the photographer of ""Eternal Beauty"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the advantages of this cooperation is that the calendar will be distributed in Germany, Austria and Switzerland thanks to the label ""Sway books"" and in Italy thanks to the Caput Mundi International Burlesque Award, when it will be released.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">This is an important project for the italian burlesque community, it will be a step towards the growth of this amazing and very valuable art, which has a long tradition and can fit in different industries, like art, culture, fashion, cinema and so on.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Italian artists are very talented and we feel the responsibility of our future, this is why your contribution will be of immense importance for the days to come.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The possible profit that we will get with the sale of ""Eternal Beauty"" 2014 calendar will be allocated to subsidize the Caput Mundi International Burlesque Award, an international burlesque festival that will be organized by us, The Missunderstanding, and will take place in Rome in november 2013, during which the calendar will be presented.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The funding are needed to cover the expenses of the achievement of this project.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Carlos will have to fly to Rome in the month of july for the shooting straight from Hamburg, Germany, he will need accommodation and a per day, this amounts to about 500 euro.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Equipment will have to be rented, the estimate is of about 2500 euro.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The post-production work and the printing will cost about 2500 euro.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It is fundamental to reach the entire goal in order to turn this little dream into reality.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">This calendar will have a limited edition of 1000 copies and will be issued in occasion of the international burlesque festival in Rome called “Caput Mundi International Burlesque Award” organized by The Missunderstanding, which will take place in November 2013.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It will be distributed in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria but it will be available on line, hoping that the beauty of Rome will get much further.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Here is a preview of the performers that have enthusiastically married this project and that will pose for us: Vampfire, Sophie D'Ishtar, Candy Rose, Peggy Sue, Giuditta Sin, Scarlett Martini, Rita Lynch, Grace Hall and of course us, Dixie Ramone and Albadoro Gala.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">During the photo shooting also a brief video of the “making of” will be shot, and it will show how every performer turns from the girl next door into a diva, what kind of relationships are set up between them and the photographer, how the set will be organized, and noteworthy moments, funny and not, that now is impossible to predict but that will surely add interesting material for our supporters.</p>
<p class=""p2"">We will be happy to receive any sort of offer and we want to thank you in advance for the support that we hope to get.</p>
<p class=""p2""> If you can't contribute, we will be happy and grateful to all those who can spread the word about this campaign in any way they can.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Thanks for your attention and support, we strongly believe in the power of people and we are positive that this project will inspire all those like us who strive to make the world a beautiful place with their art and passion!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Joshua Gyovai. I am currently a student at Radford University where I am studying Elementary Education, one of my two passions in life. My second passion is photography, although over the past year or two I have not been able to contribute to my portfolio as much as I would like. My digital SLR is slowly becoming out of date (Nikon D70) and due to some lens issues, my only lens is an 18-55mm. This means that I am very limited when going out to take photos. I am asking for donations because I want to have the desire to photograph anything and everything again, and have confidence in doing so. After graduating, and becoming a teacher, I would love to be able to use my photography skills as a summer / side job. For those of you that know photography, you know that it can be a very expensive hobby. Lenses alone can cost thousands of dollars which is a real bummer, especially to a college student. That is the real reason for creating this campaign. Fifteen hundred dollars is not really close to what I need in order to purchase new equipment, but it is a start, and I'd rather not be too greedy. Please continue to read and thank you already for showing interest in my campaign. </p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My primary need is of course new equipment, preferably: </p>
<p>- Nikon D800 or something along those lines</p>
<p>- Various lens lengths and functionalities</p>
<p>- Printing Money</p>
<p>I will be offering various perks for those of you that are able to contribute:</p>
<p>- 4x6 photographs</p>
<p>- 8x12 photographs</p>
<p>- Autographed prints</p>
<p>- Poster sized prints (18x24)</p>

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thank You</span></h4>
<p>Thank you for visiting our page. We are a group of students from the University of Westminster studying for our BA in Photography. At the end of this, our final year, we will be exhibiting our final projects at the Free Range Shows held at Old Truman Brewery in Shoreditch, London. A leading industry show, Free Range is open to the public and will also be attended by many leading industry professionals, providing us with an unparalleled opportunity to share our work in a professional context. </p>
<p>The aim of this crowdfunding campaign is to support us, a group of 45 students, in raising enough money to help pay for our show catalogue, our space at the show, as well as printing, materials for framing and display, and any other additional costs that come with installing a high quality, professional standard exhibition.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h4>
<p>We're looking to raise a total of £3,000. This money will primarily go towards collating and printing our show catalogue, an important presentation of all of our work that visitors to the exhibition can take away with them. </p>
<p>The remaining budget will go towards paying for the exhibition space (alongside contributions from the University and ourselves), and materials, framing etc. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Impact</span></h4>
<p>The show represents a culmination of three years of consistent hard work and dedication towards our craft as photographers. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a team we will be responsible for designing, setting up and curating the exhibition space. It is extremely important to make this show happen for all us, as it’s an exciting platform to show our work to a large audience and many great future opportunities are born out of exhibitions such as this one. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></h4>
<p>If you're unable to donate, you can still help just by letting people know about the show! Please share this page with all of your friends, and we hope to see you all there. </p>

The aim of this crowdfunding campaign is to support us, a group of 45 students, in raising enough money to help pay for our show catalogue, our space at the show, as well as printing, materials for framing and display, and any other additional costs that come with installing a high quality, professional standard exhibition.


What We Need & What You Get
We're looking to raise a total of £3,000. This money will primarily go towards collating and printing our show catalogue, an important presentation of all of our work that visitors to the exhibition can take away with them. 
The remaining budget will go towards paying for the exhibition space (alongside contributions from the University and ourselves), and materials, framing etc. 


The Impact
The show represents a culmination of three years of consistent hard work and dedication towards our craft as photographers. 
As a team we will be responsible for designing, setting up and curating the exhibition space. It is extremely important to make this show happen for all us, as it’s an exciting platform to show our work to a large audience and many great future opportunities are born out of exhibitions such as this one. 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you're unable to donate, you can still help just by letting people know about the show! Please share this page with all of your friends, and we hope to see you all there.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I knew that this year I didn't want to leave anything out.With previous issues of the zine I have held back and edited what I put in the zine and just put in what I thought was the best but really ended up regretting not putting some pictures in.With that being said, this year I am not holding anything out, every photograph that I have shot with my FujiFilm x100 will be put into the zine which makes it pretty much twice the size.This is where you come in!Because its twice the size its hard for me to pull the funds to push a project this big on my own.I have lined up a ton of cool rewards for every backer and will be busting my butt to make sure we (because with out you it can't happen!) can put this project into motion.So thats about it!Summer of Shred 2014 is all put together and ready to be sent off to the printer, I just need the help to send it there!Shred Til Death,Jamie M.

Just because the campaign is over doesn't mean you can't support the Kenya workshop!Just donate directly on our website!

We are View Finder Workshop.And we create opportunities for disadvantaged children to discover self-expression, self-confidence & self-worth through photography. We put cameras in the hands of children, letting them tell their own stories of who they are & how they see their world. The results are phenomenal. 


Photographs taken by restaveks (child slaves) & other vulnerable children during our Haiti workshop, January 2013.

Where we are going next.
This November, we are partnering with The Supply, an organization that built a secondary school in the heart of the Lenana slum in Nairobi, Kenya. They are committed to developing the children’s awareness of who they are within their own community. Together, we are designing a tailor-made 5-day workshop for all the students in Form 1 (that’s 9th grade to you) to explore the themes of identity & human dignity.

At the end of the week, we will host a gallery show at their school to exhibit the children’s photographs & share their vision with the local community. All the camera & printing equipment we bring to Kenya will remain at the school in Lenana, so the children can continue their photography education long after the workshop is over.
All, for just twenty bucks.The cost of the whole workshop is $20,000. That's 1,000 people giving only $20 each. Just $20! Which is the equivalent of just 4 Starbucks coffees or a pedicure or a large pizza with all the trimmings. Donate $20 today! And ask 5 of your friends to donate, too. But let’s be honest. If you're inspired to give more, we won’t turn you down. 
 
What your money will buy.   • Cameras & printing equipment*   • Basic travel & living expenses for 4 volunteers for a week
     • Production of a short documentary about the workshop

*Price List                        $15 : camera case                       $20 : rechargeable battery                       $25 : memory card                       $30 : one ink cartridge                       $75 : one ream of paper                     $150 : camera                      $175 : hard drive                     $200 : printer                  $1,500 : laptop
What you'll be getting.A very big, heartfelt thank you from us. Some warm & fuzzy feelings. A great story to share with your friends. Oh, and some highly desirable perks too:   • A beautiful digital book of the children’s photographs   • A gorgeous print of one student’s work   • A stunning coffee table book with images taken by the children   • Even Producer title on the film about the workshop!




Thank you, thank you, thank you!Big or small, your donation will make it possible for 40 children living in the slums of Nairobi to experience photography for the first time. And that is extraordinary.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>The life in the streets of the Indian megacities New Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Bangalore fascinated me. In all parts of the society I could see the traces of westernization and on the other side I could feel the deep routedness of the citizens in the traditional Indian culture. The vivid urban chaos full of crazy contradictions is showing the permanent competition between the different value systems. Billboards, advertising campaigns, film- and election posters, fashion images are mixed together with omnipresent god idols and historical symbols in the cityscape.</p>
<p>The lust for all this attractions in everyday situations is permanently forcing changes in social life. Indian Culture is influenced by the spiritual idea of Karma and this effects, that every single action in life is very important and has consequences. By taking photographs I was driven by this catchable tension, looking for all the normally overseen details and not illustrating distant ideologies. My respectful view on this overwhelming, mesmerizing and also sometimes irritating world is also meant as a statement of tolerance for different ways of life and religions.</p>

<p><i>Untitled, </i>New Delhi, 2013, from the book<i> Karma Driver</i><br/> </p>
<h3>The Philosophy of images</h3>
<p>My challenge of the encounter with the unfamiliar world of Indian megacities is to create an individual picture language, which not keep the unknown in the realm of the exotic, but which discovers the nearness in the strange. The image of India in the international media world is dominated by colorful clichés of happiness or dramatic journalistic visions of disasters. My vision is more literary, influenced by the magic realism of Indian writing, such as by Salman Rushdie. Only a many-layered imagery full of unexpected discoveries and surprises can express my various feelings during the adventure of Indian everyday life.</p>
<p>In the book <i>Karma Driver</i> I am combining two different styles of photography. Vertical fragmentary views on urban spaces and objects were put together on the double pages to collage-like picture constellations. The enigmatic visual dialogue is creating an aesthetic ambivalence between harmony and confrontation. The spectator has the freedom to find own interpretations for the culture clash of eastern and western values. Another layer in the sequencing of photographic images are horizontal street photographs, focussing in a straight and at once subtle way on the condition of human life in the cities pf contemporary India.<br/> </p>

<h3>The Book <i>Karma Driver</i>
</h3>
<p>I am very happy, that the famous agency Heine/Lenz/Zizka is supporting me again by creating the design of the book <i>Karma Driver</i>. We realized together my earlier book projects <i>Drift </i>(2007), <i>China! Which China? </i>(2008), <i>Catch </i>(2015) and I really trust in their great skills.</p>
<p>The book should not be an ordinary container for photographic images. It must be a special object and all used materials have to work together to make it unique. The specialist for printing and enthusiast for book making Richard Reisen will help me to find the perfect papers and the exact image processing to give the colors in the photographs from India a bright life.</p>
<p>The 93 color photographs in the book will be framed by two very different texts. The introduction will be by the German Indologist Heinrich Zimmer. His philosophical statement from 1930 about <i>Eternal India</i> is at the same time an intense reflection of the role of images in the context of cultural identity. The essay <i>My Hindi-Medium Father</i> by the young Indian author Nimisha Misra at the end of the publication is a very personal and intelligent view on the influences of westernization to private life in contemporary India.</p>
<p>It’s fantastic, that <i>Karma Driver</i> will be published by Fotohof Salzburg,<br/>an internationally very well known center for photography.<br/><br/>The publication is planned in May 2018<br/>and will be launched at the Fotobookfestival Kassel (31.5.-3.6.2018).</p>

The truth of the matter is, women today in the first world are treated far better than anywhere else in the world and in all of history.</p><p>The first thing you need to understand is that we do not hate women. We believe in equality for both genders, and endorse the idea that helping men doesn't take away support from women. This isn't about hate, this is about love of all people. Except when it comes down to it, the greatest victims are those who are unable to have a voice, who are blamed for all the ills of the world. Men are expected to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, even if that means no one will be there for them when they are in need of help.</p><p>Men suffer at a greater rate than women in the western world, but you never hear about it. Many organizations out there do what they can to silence the voices of those who just want a discussion, whether it's protesting a public speaking event, or shutting down the screening of a movie discussing important issues.</p><p>This calendar attempts to bring to light many problems that are easily ignored. The three of us (Modern Medusa, Reading Wren, and mad_cat) have seen men overlooked by society. This is why we dedicate our lives to helping in any way we can. The first step is to raise awareness, and that starts with releasing a calendar that will not only feature many women who want to help men, but also discuss key issues that many try to silence or ignore.</p><p>We only need <strong>$500</strong> to produce calendars with pictures of beautiful ladies and facts about men's issues! Once we have the calendars, we will continue to sell each one for $20 on our <a href=""http://www.llofmm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. With every sale we make, a portion of the proceeds will go to Veterans Mentoring Veterans, an awesome charity that trains veterans in high-demand careers!</p><p>It is our hope that we reach well-beyond our asking amount, as that allows us to expand our products, and donate even more to help veterans!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493887844/jhwntybpkqlbvbkigbzc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Confirmed Models</h2><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">(so far)</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Anna Cherry (January)<br/>Rachel Souza (February)<br/>Shagrin Anne Barrett (March)<br/>Prim Reaper (April)<br/>Unvarnished Void (May)<br/>RioVenture (June)<br/>Reading Wren (July)<br/>Sassy Shelly (August)<br/>Stuttering Soliloquy (September)<br/>Modern Medusa (October)<br/>Based Mama (November)<br/>Mercedes Carrera (December)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496973474/askhp0chkvrit72knitc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Tiered Items</strong></h2><p><strong>$1</strong> - We want to remember each and every one of you who donate to us.

Since we are based in the United States, shipping overseas requires additional fees. This is only for the tiers that have physical items.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How are you supporting Men's Issues with pictures of women?</strong></p><p>First off, there are many women within the Men's Movement that want to see men given a voice. They have fathers, brothers, sons, lovers, and friends who are men, and are tired of them getting a raw deal in society and being punished simply for being born male.</p><p>Secondly, whether it's men or women, straight or gay, we know people love the look of a beautiful woman. We know that this will be one of the main reasons someone buys our calendar, which is why we want to include facts about men's issues with each picture. Thus, when someone hangs this calendar up; others will see it, and be exposed to facts that are otherwise silenced in our society today.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Do these women know you're using their images?</strong></p><p>Yes, they know. We asked each one personally if they want to appear in this calendar.

The truth of the matter is, women today in the first world are treated far better than anywhere else in the world and in all of history.The first thing you need to understand is that we do not hate women. We believe in equality for both genders, and endorse the idea that helping men doesn't take away support from women. This isn't about hate, this is about love of all people. Except when it comes down to it, the greatest victims are those who are unable to have a voice, who are blamed for all the ills of the world. Men are expected to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, even if that means no one will be there for them when they are in need of help.Men suffer at a greater rate than women in the western world, but you never hear about it. Many organizations out there do what they can to silence the voices of those who just want a discussion, whether it's protesting a public speaking event, or shutting down the screening of a movie discussing important issues.This calendar attempts to bring to light many problems that are easily ignored. The three of us (Modern Medusa, Reading Wren, and mad_cat) have seen men overlooked by society. This is why we dedicate our lives to helping in any way we can. The first step is to raise awareness, and that starts with releasing a calendar that will not only feature many women who want to help men, but also discuss key issues that many try to silence or ignore.We only need $500 to produce calendars with pictures of beautiful ladies and facts about men's issues! Once we have the calendars, we will continue to sell each one for $20 on our website. With every sale we make, a portion of the proceeds will go to Veterans Mentoring Veterans, an awesome charity that trains veterans in high-demand careers!It is our hope that we reach well-beyond our asking amount, as that allows us to expand our products, and donate even more to help veterans!Confirmed Models(so far)Anna Cherry (January)Rachel Souza (February)Shagrin Anne Barrett (March)Prim Reaper (April)Unvarnished Void (May)RioVenture (June)Reading Wren (July)Sassy Shelly (August)Stuttering Soliloquy (September)Modern Medusa (October)Based Mama (November)Mercedes Carrera (December)Tiered Items$1 - We want to remember each and every one of you who donate to us.

This would include behind-the-scenes of the special photoshoot, as well as interviews with models, those putting the calendar together, guest speakers, and those in attendence. More than that, we want to start doing special videos in the future of going to college campuses or public locations to do interviews on the street and ask about Men's Issues. This would help pay for a camera and mic, as well as other equipment to make this happen.Anything beyond that will allow us to print more calendars and other products!FAQHow big will the calendar be?The calendar, when open, will be 8.5 x 11.I'm outside the US, why am I being charged more?This is an extra charge for shipping. Since we are based in the United States, shipping overseas requires additional fees. This is only for the tiers that have physical items.How are you supporting Men's Issues with pictures of women?First off, there are many women within the Men's Movement that want to see men given a voice. They have fathers, brothers, sons, lovers, and friends who are men, and are tired of them getting a raw deal in society and being punished simply for being born male.Secondly, whether it's men or women, straight or gay, we know people love the look of a beautiful woman. We know that this will be one of the main reasons someone buys our calendar, which is why we want to include facts about men's issues with each picture. Thus, when someone hangs this calendar up; others will see it, and be exposed to facts that are otherwise silenced in our society today.Do these women know you're using their images?Yes, they know. We asked each one personally if they want to appear in this calendar. They are also aware that this for Men's Issues, and all of them wanted to be part of this for that reason.You are for Men's Rights and have a calendar full of women wearing almost nothing, do you hate women?No, we don't hate women. We in fact love women... that's why we are doing this. Being for Men's Rights doesn't mean we are against women having rights. This isn't a zero-sum game for us, and we believe both can be treated equally under the law and within society itself. That is our ultimate goal.Furthermore, sexuality is very beautiful and what makes us human. Many of us are quite sexual, and enjoy the display of beautiful women in sexy poses. Whether one's sexuality is masculine or feminine, no one should feel ashamed for what they desire.Why can't I just give my money to the charity itself?You are welcome and encouraged to do so. It is an amazing charity that does great things for  veterans who need help. It is our hope however, that by giving people something they want, we can raise more money to get more products, with a portion of each sale going to charity.Plus, our calendar has information listed on it that would be good for anyone out there that might not know about these problems that men face. So in supporting this campaign, we can raise awareness and help out a great cause... all at the same time!So are you capitalizing on the Men's Movement, and taking advantage of Men's Issues for profit?The money that is earned from this campaign will go into buying products for us to sell. The money earned from sales will go to charity and to those who put this calendar together (including our Lovely Ladies). Our goal is not to make money from this. Our primary goal is to get the message out there about the issues men have, while also helping veterans.I'm interested in appearing in the calendar, what do I need to do?If you would like to be in our 2018 calendar, we are accepting submissions from all women willing to get involved.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Elijah Kihlstadius. I'm 19 years old, and I want to make a difference in this world. My story starts many years back, really. Growing up, is was in a very emotionally and verbally abusive environment. I was always the odd kid out, the odd ball, and the misfit. Unfortunately that environment changed me for the worse, as I grew up hating myself and hating everyone around me as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As I grew into my teen years, simple self hate and low self esteem stemmed into real serious problems. At first, it was simple self neglect and social avoidance. Then growing into my later teen years, I began to develop an poor eating habits, depression, and extreme avoidance of everyone around me.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">In May of this year I was diagnosed with extreme depression. I was told that I should not be able to function. I was told that people in my mental state should not be able to work or go to school. I was told that people, like me, should be immediately admitted into a hospital for intensive treatment and therapy. And yet, here I am. Still trying to achieve my goals and show the world that God is not limited by my weaknesses.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">“But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” - 2 Corinthians 12:9-10</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In addition to being diagnosed with depression, I have also been fighting an eating disorder. Technically classified as E.D.N.O.S.

<p>Excerpts from the books foreword</p>
<p><i>“These are the ordinary woods, we all know
woodlands like these; often over-looked, unnoticed or ignored by most. Places
to be passed as we go about our lives, patches in the corner of fields, by the
roadside, on the fringes of urbanisation, all remnants of a once heavily wooded countryside – forming parts of
the ‘edgelands’.”</i></p>
<p><i>“...In all
cases, what appears to be no more than invaluable woodland has an unexpected
beauty of its own, sometimes best enjoyed by walking alone; in solitude.”</i></p>

<p>The premise is not to create a mass produced piece
of work, partly driven by my desire to finish the production of each book by
hand. This fits with my ethos of direct physical involvement with each and
every image; from making the photographs, developing the film, preparation for
print and hand finishing each book.</p>
<p>Quality and presentation of the work will be at the
forefront of the project and I believe those objectives will be obtained both
through my own passion for quality but also through selecting to work with
arguably one of the leading fine art photography book producers as a mentor;
Eddie Ephraums. With 30 years experience in the trade and himself a talented photographer;
Eddie’s knowledge of fine art book production is second to none.</p>

work for me and somewhat reduces the amount of books that can be produced, it
fits with my ethos of producing as much of the work by my own hand and I believe
is complementary to the body of work itself.</span><br/></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p>                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431018480/mj3d87sozvmjlw9rfnu6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 440.5px; height: 352px;""/></p>

<p>I have limited each image in the overall photographic

of all printed sizes. </p><p>For the 5 image options being made available with the Collector’s
Edition book (see below). Only 7 of 15 from each image edition will be made available to purchase with the Collector’s Edition book. Choice of image print option is based on a first come

<p>Backing the project is as simple as choosing to
pledge a nominated amount of funds, with an option to take a ‘perk’ or not;
both routes are showing your support to help me fund the production of the
final amounts of materials to create the books.</p>
<p>The concept of perks allows me to reward your
support through providing products or services in return. The perks I will be
providing are based on three aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single Standard Edition
     book choice.</li>
<li>Five choices based around the
     Collector’s Edition book, each choice is based on one of the fine art
     print options (See image options in the following section).</li>
<li>An opportunity to experience
     photographing with an 8x10 large format field camera on a 1-to-1 workshop
     with me (further details in a later section).</li>
</ul>
<p>You are more than welcome to make any combination
of or, choose multiples of one or more of each of the perk choices or, as
outlined to simply pledge without taking a perk.</p>
<p>Perks are chosen at the point you pledge using one
of the perk boxes down the right hand side of this page. For multiple perks
and/or repeat perks, this is perfectly possible but unfortunately the Indiegogo
campaign platform requires you to choose each perk as individual pledges.</p><p><b>For this campaign only, prices include postage and packaging costs within the UK</b>. Unfortunately I will have to charge a supplement for overseas postage, see bottom of the page for more details.</p>

Storytelling is one of mankind's defining features in our ability to communicate and no more so than through images. For me, images
- photographs - are best printed, in either print or book form. As such the intent of publishing a book of a series
of photographs with an option of accompanying prints is a natural conclusion to
close of a chapter of images I have produced, to allow that story to be told.The photographsThe images themselves were taken during some of the wettest years Britain had suffered in living memory; 2012-2014. They capture the unexpected beauty of a flooded woodland edgeland.
                        
Excerpts from the books foreword
“These are the ordinary woods, we all know
woodlands like these; often over-looked, unnoticed or ignored by most. Places
to be passed as we go about our lives, patches in the corner of fields, by the
roadside, on the fringes of urbanisation, all remnants of a once heavily wooded countryside – forming parts of
the ‘edgelands’.”
“...In all
cases, what appears to be no more than invaluable woodland has an unexpected
beauty of its own, sometimes best enjoyed by walking alone; in solitude.”
“It is through enjoying solitude in woodlands, or
indeed the countryside as a whole, that we come to experience nature and
understand its being and our relationship to it; for we are nature”
                        I am honoured to say that work from this series has been commended as part of the UK Outdoor Photography magazine 2015 awards and has also been shortlisted as part of the acclaimed international contemporary photography awards; Fotofilmic '15
The project ethos
The premise is not to create a mass produced piece
of work, partly driven by my desire to finish the production of each book by
hand. This fits with my ethos of direct physical involvement with each and
every image; from making the photographs, developing the film, preparation for
print and hand finishing each book.
Quality and presentation of the work will be at the
forefront of the project and I believe those objectives will be obtained both
through my own passion for quality but also through selecting to work with
arguably one of the leading fine art photography book producers as a mentor;
Eddie Ephraums. With 30 years experience in the trade and himself a talented photographer;
Eddie’s knowledge of fine art book production is second to none.

Note: The images shown on this site of the book are from the first set of prototypes I made to develop the concept. As such the final specification of the book may change subtly during final production stages.I will be using a hand finished book binding
technique for the book; based on a traditional stab binding/stitching process. I have designed and prototyped the book from scratch to ensure it handles and reads to complement the photographic subject matter, the aim being to invoke senses beyond just sight.The constituent components of the book will be printed and manufactured commercially under the guidance of Eddie and, myself to sign off proofs and materials. I will then assemble, hand finish and bind them all myself. Whilst this is arguably more
work for me and somewhat reduces the amount of books that can be produced, it
fits with my ethos of producing as much of the work by my own hand and I believe
is complementary to the body of work itself.                       

The book will be available in two versions - a
Standard Edition and a Collector’s Edition.Standard Edition:
This edition will be limited to a 65 copy first edition print run and, will be signed and numbered by me. 
Note: Just 30 of these will be made available through this campaign, further sales will be handled thereafter through my website and other outlets with an initial expected retail price of £45.00 plus postage and packing.
210 mm x 300 mm, ~80 pages.

Tactile soft cover with stitched binding technique using contrasting thread.

                                        Collector’s Edition:

Featuring the same book content as the Standard Edition. 
This edition will be limited
     to just 35 copies; ever and, will be signed and numbered by
     me. 
Note: Just 15 of these will be made available through this campaign, further sales will be handled thereafter through my website and other outlets with an initial expected retail price of £95.00 plus postage and packing.
This edition includes
     a unique cloth bound case with each case inset with a
     different image featured in the series, making each
     Collector's Edition a one-off. 


This edition will also come
     with a limited edition print, of which you will be able to make a choice
     of an image from a small selection of photographs from the series itself (these
     choices form the basis of the pre-order options - ‘perks’ - with details provided further down the
     page).


                                  
Please note: the image shown on the case is for illustrative purposes. Each and every copy of the Collector's Edition will feature a singularly unique image from the overall series of photographs; making each copy of the Collector's Edition unique!

The fine art prints
All fine art prints are made using archival quality
materials; fine art papers and ink set. I will be printing these myself, this
way you can be assured of receiving a final print that meets the exceptionally
high standards I set myself.
I have limited each image in the overall photographic
series to a total edition size of 15 prints per image; that total is inclusive
of all printed sizes. For the 5 image options being made available with the Collector’s
Edition book (see below). Only 7 of 15 from each image edition will be made available to purchase with the Collector’s Edition book. Choice of image print option is based on a first come
first served basis.
How to back the project
Backing the project is as simple as choosing to
pledge a nominated amount of funds, with an option to take a ‘perk’ or not;
both routes are showing your support to help me fund the production of the
final amounts of materials to create the books.
The concept of perks allows me to reward your
support through providing products or services in return. The perks I will be
providing are based on three aspects:

A single Standard Edition
     book choice.
Five choices based around the
     Collector’s Edition book, each choice is based on one of the fine art
     print options (See image options in the following section).
An opportunity to experience
     photographing with an 8x10 large format field camera on a 1-to-1 workshop
     with me (further details in a later section).

You are more than welcome to make any combination
of or, choose multiples of one or more of each of the perk choices or, as
outlined to simply pledge without taking a perk.
Perks are chosen at the point you pledge using one
of the perk boxes down the right hand side of this page. For multiple perks
and/or repeat perks, this is perfectly possible but unfortunately the Indiegogo
campaign platform requires you to choose each perk as individual pledges.For this campaign only, prices include postage and packaging costs within the UK. Unfortunately I will have to charge a supplement for overseas postage, see bottom of the page for more details.

The teamJoe Wright(Photographer and author of The Floods)                                                                 Having spent much of my formative years living, learning and working in the countryside it was inevitable that when I picked up a camera it would be directed towards landscapes. I am passionate about using images to tell stories of the often overlooked typically quieter ordinary places of the British countryside.I also regularly contribute and feature in national and international photography related articles and features, both printed and online.Joe's website - http://www.joewrightphotography.comEddie Ephraums(Technical and artistic mentor)Photographer, writer, photobook maker and mentor. Eddie runs Envisage Books, providing creative and practical support for photographers wishing to convey their unique vision through bespoke small edition books.As well as running his London-based Envisage photobook mentoring scheme, Eddie also co-runs the Open Studio Photo Workshop Centre in the wilds of NW Scotland, leading workshops with top UK photographers.Over the years, Eddie has written for many eminent photography magazines, including the BJP and Black & White Photography, for whom he is a monthly columnist, sharing his particular vision on monochrome, with special emphasis on photobook making. He’s also been a judge of many prestigious competitions, including B&W Photographer of the Year and Landscape Photographer of the Year.Eddie's website - Envisage BooksIn summaryIn summary the project is based around a few simple
objectives:

To bring to life a completed
     series of photographs through the publication of an edition based
     book; available in two formats.
Provide an opportunity to
     obtain Limited Edition prints of the photographs.
Offer the book and prints at
     an introductory below retail price.
A unique opportunity to
     experience working with an 8x10 large format film camera “on the location”
     through a one day 1-to-1 workshop with me (with an alternative bespoke
     option available).

TermsNote: p&p is included within the price for the UK only – a separate additional p&p supplement applies for non-UK based locations. As follows:Standard Edition book

Western europe - £6.00


Rest of the world - £10.00

Collector's Edition book (Quite a bit heavier)
Western europe - £15.00
Rest of the world - £20.00
Here's how to buy if purchasing from overseas. Indiegogo don't make this easy unfortunately! Please read carefully.DO NOT select a perk, instead, pledge the total amount required to buy the book plus the required postage amount. When you submit the pledge you will be able to choose a perk and pledge an additional amount which allows you to add the postage amount.For example, to buy the Standard Edition book and ship to the USA: £35.00 + £10.00 = pledge amount of £45.00. So, pledge £45.00, choose the Standard Edition book perk and then add the £10.00 for postage in the 'additional' pledge amount box.Note: Until the book goes into production all specifications are subject to last minute change.It leaves me to just say for now that the book will go ahead regardless of the campaign funding target being reached! So, all being well that covers everything you need to go
ahead and support my project; otherwise feel
free to contact me directly either through this campaign page or through my
website

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello :)</p>
<p>My name is Monica, I'm a 23 years old girl and I live in Spain.</p>
<p>My dream is to become a fashion photographer! that's why I studied photography for 2 years and I've dedicated it all to grow up in the photography industry.</p>
<p>Even so, I've realized I still need to learn a lot about fashion photography, since I studied photography in general, so I decided to keep on my studies to be able to grow up as a better photographer and to take a Fashion Photography course in Barcelona to achieve my dream and keep my passion. Here's where I need your help... that academic course costs 5.000€, and though I've been looking for a job like crazy the whole year to pay for it, I barely earned a little part because of the unemployment situation in my country.</p>
<p>I won't stop fighting, of course not :) but if someone there gives me a hand,  i would be incredibly grateful and happy! I will do my best!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As I said, I need 5,000€ to pay my studies about Fashion Photography. That academic course takes place in an Arts University in Barcelona, called IDEP.</p>
<p>I've been working hard to get great photographies for my portfolio, and even though I need to improve a lot (and I will!), each of my pictures is an important part of me, and to every person that helps me I'm sending some of my work to say thank you♥</p>
<p>You will get photography prints and stuff. You can see it on the right ^^</p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><font size=""4"">My Story</font></h3>
<p>I have been working as a photographer for the last six years. I studied photography at LCC, part of University of the Arts London and graduated with a distinction in 2009. The majority of my work has been commission based, primarily in the fields of environmental portraiture and live events such as festivals, concerts, theatre productions and even a dabble in movie stills.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Something I have been lacking, however, is personal projects. Because of this, I feel that I've restricted myself creatively, which is a vital piece of the puzzle as a photographer. For several months I have been itching to launch myself into a project whole-heartedly, and that's what this is about.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For the last two years I have spent much of my time working as a bicycle messenger. I have met some great, interesting people who spend every day risking their lives dodging vehicles and pedestrians to get urgent packages across the city through wind, rain and snow. Even considering the constant danger of the job, it still often pays below minimum wage. These people don't do it for the money. For these people, it's about the thrill of being outside, cycling with such adrenaline, and a sense of freedom that barely any other job can provide. It is these very people I wish to document.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm looking to conduct a portrait series of these couriers. I want to capture the detail of these people, the clothes that they wear, their weathered faces, their tattoos, scars, even their bikes. I want to do this through medium-format colour film. I want to do it properly. I'm hoping that from this, I will be able to have the work printed larger than life and exhibited in a gallery space in London as well as release a full photo book of the portraits. <span class=""text_exposed_show"">I also intend on submitting it to several photo competitions like the Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize.</span></p>

<h3><font size=""4"">The Impact</font></h3>I'm hoping that through this project, people will be able to acknowledge bicycle messengers as a persons, a community, and enable us to bring people together to appreciate photography. I find bicycle messengers to be very visually interesting people, I can't help but want to photograph them, and want to bring this to the attention of the masses. I want people to be able to see every detail of the bicycle messenger, large and in-depth.<br/><br/><span class=""text_exposed_show"">If I manage to complete this project, a

whilst at work.</span><br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3><font size=""4"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</font></h3>
<p>To make this project possible, I'm going to be taking a step away from everything else and focus entirely on photographing this series. I'm hoping I can invest in the right equipment, not settling for a 2:3 ratio image, but rather a classic 6:7 medium format to capture the subjects in the right way and absorb all the detail they have to offer in the images.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I will be looking to raise funds to cover the costs of equipment, film, processing and development, printing and framing of the exhibition pieces as well as the potential printing of an accompanying photo book.</p>
<br/>I will be funding this project as much as I can myself, but hope that you will be able to assist me to make this happen. I believe that at least $5000 (about £3000) is a realistic goal to help achieve what I believe possible. The more I can raise, the more likely it will develop into a project that can be displayed in a better gallery, with larger prints with a professional finish and the materialisation of a hardcover book.<br/><br/>In return, I am happy to offer many thanks, as well as prints of the images, invites to the private view of the exhibition, signed copies of the final book and more.<br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE: THIS SITE WORKS IN US DOLLARS - HERE IS AN APPROX.

<p>I
hope this video doesn't make me look like I am too full of myself. I
thought it was important I show you the scope of what I have done and
am capable of doing. This is of course only a
small sampling but there is already more than anyone really wants to
see and this video is way longer than the recommended length. 

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My
photos are  labor intensive and expensive to produce and even with
the new added advantages of Photoshop, they are not snapshots of some
remarkable object or extraordinary vista you've come upon and want to
record. My photos begin in my imagination and whatever I see there I
try to realize in the real world so I can share them with whoever is
interested. I have always dreamed beyond my pocketbook and “defied
the elephants” more often than not. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There
is very little I have ever done that was not achieved amidst a chorus
of nay sayers. I know they were all well intentioned and only being
sensible and looking out for my own good... trying to spare me more
failure. However if I had listened to their advice I would never have
done whatever I did that brought me to your attention. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This
is my new exploration. I believe there are people out there that do
not think a man is over with at my age. Most teenagers could not put
in as many hours as I do. I am betting on there being people who know
that this is the most productive and informed time of life for a
person such as myself. I still have so many pretty good ideas in one
day I have been criticized for having too many.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But
there is an added advantage.... I  have acquired... accumulated over
the years.... the knowledge how to achieve my vision whatever it
might  be. The first photos I took... never having been to any
photography school were of a sea nymph swimming in his underwater
fantasy world and it was shot in my front room. There were nothing
but naysayers then. They all laughed when I sat down at  the piano
...but when I  played!!!!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And
so despite the doubters that still surround me with warning after
warning, I am asking for your help to rise again above their protests
and to prove to some small part of the world that neither age, nor
fear of failure and being stored away in some home for the poor and

</div></div>","Dear friends,
I
hope this video doesn't make me look like I am too full of myself. I
thought it was important I show you the scope of what I have done and
am capable of doing. This is of course only a
small sampling but there is already more than anyone really wants to
see and this video is way longer than the recommended length. 




My
photos are  labor intensive and expensive to produce and even with
the new added advantages of Photoshop, they are not snapshots of some
remarkable object or extraordinary vista you've come upon and want to
record. My photos begin in my imagination and whatever I see there I
try to realize in the real world so I can share them with whoever is
interested. I have always dreamed beyond my pocketbook and “defied
the elephants” more often than not. 



There
is very little I have ever done that was not achieved amidst a chorus
of nay sayers. I know they were all well intentioned and only being
sensible and looking out for my own good... trying to spare me more
failure. However if I had listened to their advice I would never have
done whatever I did that brought me to your attention. 



This
is my new exploration. I believe there are people out there that do
not think a man is over with at my age. Most teenagers could not put
in as many hours as I do. I am betting on there being people who know
that this is the most productive and informed time of life for a
person such as myself. I still have so many pretty good ideas in one
day I have been criticized for having too many.


But
there is an added advantage.... I  have acquired... accumulated over
the years.... the knowledge how to achieve my vision whatever it
might  be. The first photos I took... never having been to any
photography school were of a sea nymph swimming in his underwater
fantasy world and it was shot in my front room. There were nothing
but naysayers then. They all laughed when I sat down at  the piano
...but when I  played!!!!


And
so despite the doubters that still surround me with warning after
warning, I am asking for your help to rise again above their protests
and to prove to some small part of the world that neither age, nor
fear of failure and being stored away in some home for the poor and
elderly, nor any amount of good sense and despite how humble my
circumstances ….dreams can still be made into realities. 



What
sensible person would have thought they could make a man appear to be
swimming through an underwater MGM set in their living room...before
computers...before anyone even considered something like photoshop?


One
more thought.. Naturally I am not implying I am in the same league
however Frank Lloyd Wright did some of his greatest work in his late
80s... and Betty White is still hot in Cleveland and being nominated
for and winning Emmy awards.
Thank you,

Me to Shed Some Light</b></p>
<p>It all started with
an experiment in lighting: isolating a figure in space, lit starkly from above
and directly below. I’d never dreamed of seeing the human body and spirit so
vulnerable, so powerful and so erotic. There was simply no going back. In the
nearly three and half years since those first exploratory sessions, over 100
models in 78 sessions have stepped into the Lumination spotlight.</p>
<p>I have never worked
harder, never lost more sleep, and never had so much support in any project
that I have ever attempted. The Lumination Project features dancers, fashion
models, athletes laying bare their raw power, passions, and vulnerabilities…</p>
<p>And now my sincerest
hope is to share that energy and experience with you.</p>
<p>I am Calgary-based
Photographer Tim Nguyen, owner of Citrus Photography, and I have been
photographing everything I come in contact with for nearly half of my life.
From fashion to industrial machinery to insects to nudes, every experience has
lead me here, culminating in this body of work. The Lumination Project is ready
for the printed page.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444797269/onwp9ia7y2p5xlblta9h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

Your Contributions Will Help</b></p>
<p>You will be directly
responsible for seeing this project realized in print – infinitely increasing
the exposure of the Lumination Project to local shops, galleries and art-loving
homes. But we don’t want Lumination to stop there! We have long-term plans for
copies to be sent to major publications in hopes of being picked up nationally
and internationally.</p>
<p>For all that to
happen, the skinny is this: digital book printing is very expensive, and we
need funding to produce the book. We’ve got the pagination done, and it’s a
vision to behold: a gorgeous, 108-page, 11” x 13” hardcover coffee table book.
This book will be a perfect collector’s item for lovers of fine art
photography, nudes, local art and those with too much space on their coffee
tables.</p>
<p>At the time of
putting this campaign public, the best quote received to print the book was
just over $70 per copy. The more books we can put in a production run, the
lower the costs, which means even more Lumination books around the world! We’re
ready to print when you are.</p>

Challenges</b></p>
<p>Your funding is going
towards offsetting a huge loan that we have taken to ensure that these books
are printed regardless of contributions. We want to take the printed product to
galleries, coffee shops, local book retailers and many others to share this
beautiful work as widely as possible.</p>
<p>What we need is for
you to help spread the word. The Lumination Book has finally arrived! And (all
things permitting) be in your hands for Christmas!</p>
<p>If our funding goals
are not met, the pre-orders made through this campaign will be fulfilled
regardless, but there will be even greater challenges ahead to bring our
visibility to the next level. </p>
