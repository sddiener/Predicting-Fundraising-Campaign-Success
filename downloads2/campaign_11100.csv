</div></section></div></div>","When a filmmaker’s wildest ideas materialize, an amazing video comes to life. Armed with photo gear that gives us magical powers, we the content creators, always strive to seize the moment. 
 
But a fully geared-up trip on a productive and high-quality film-making adventure requires so much equipment - a tripod, a monopod, a slider, a jib arm, a drone, a camera controller, and more.
 
 
Wouldn’t it be so much easier if we could have all the functions we need combined into one device? 
 
That’s why we created the MOZA Slypod Pro for all filmmakers, content creators, and videography lovers! The trusty monopod redefined into the 3-in-1 Slypod Pro. A monopod that combines an electric slider and jib arm empowering content creators to ""Capture the World's Wonders"". We know that you will enjoy the Slypod Pro as much as you enjoy film making. Check out our Slypod Pro Story Below: 


 

 
 
This compact and lightweight monopod achieves impossible angle shots, and puts ideas within reach so that filmmakers can go beyond the impossible to realize their full creativity with professional shots outdoors, while traveling lightly, and also saving space in their studios.  

 

We loaned pre-production samples of the Slypod Pro to some of our favorite content creators on YouTube. Here's what they had to say:

 

 


 

 

 

 


 
 
 
 
  
 As Powerful As Any Monopod  
The Slypod Pro can extend out to 530mm for a total length of 1380mm. Capture the world's wonders anywhere you go with a portable motorized slider that can be used as a slider or a jib. 
 

Slypod Redefines The Monopod 
The MOZA Slypod Pro is the world’s first electronic height adjustable monopod which can be fully extended and controlled with just one hand. To achieve this, a motor was installed inside the main body which enables it to be controlled more conveniently compared to traditional monopods. Save time, avoid complicated setups, and never miss a shot with Slypod Pro. 
 
 
 As Practical As Any Slider 
Tell your story with perfectly smooth motion shots. Using the ultra-portable and powerful Slypod Pro, to create cinematic shots and sublime video. 
 
 Fully Optimized Jib Arm 
The Slypod Pro is your smart electronic camera assistant. It acts as both a motorized slider and an extendable jib arm to capture memorable time-lapse photography from any desired angle. 
 
 
 
Easy To Set Up
As a cutting-edge camera partner, Slypod Pro was designed to take care of all settings, which eliminates time-consuming and complicated setup. It allows content creators to only focus on creativity, quickly get into the zone, capture shots from impossible angles fast and easy, and never miss an important shot. 
 
 
Macro Photography
With the support from Slypod Pro, it is possible to conduct an up-close exploration of the world using a macro lens and film objects like insects, plants, and food from unique angles and perspectives. The motorized slider enables content creators to move cameras forward and backward steadily and smoothly while the speed can be adjusted in a particular range via the MOZA Master App. Imagine the powerful visual impact and masterful video this technique can bring to your content. 
 
Spinning Shot
With lightweight and ultimate portability, the Jib Arm function of Slypod Pro can be utilized to create spinning shots, which can present the beauty of nature and landscapes in an imaginative way. 
 
God-like perspective 
Slypod Pro allows videographers to film from a high angle to the ground just like having a 'God-like perspective' of the world around us. From this perspective, you are given the omniscient power to see through everything from a wider angle and capture every small detail. Similarly, its Jib Arm function can simulate drone views, shooting from a high angle to a lower angle. Create fabulous scenes without expensive drones or when drones are prohibited at some scenic sites. 
 
Dynamic Time-lapse
Time-lapse photography, integrating a series of still photos captured over a period of time into a film, is one of the most exciting and impressive cinematography techniques. With Slypod Pro you can do this! 
 
Place Slypod Pro horizontally above a tripod, the extension part of it can slide out to take shots from multiple angles smoothly and steadily. During the capture, the speed and length can be precisely controlled by our smart but user-friendly MOZA MASTER APP. Star Trail Time-lapse
 
Dolly Shot
Using its slider function, Slypod Pro is able to create the famous Dolly Shot, one of the most fantastic filming techniques, which allows the scenes to be seen in a wider angle with more background but also draws the attention of the audience, emphasizing important objects. Add these eye-catching scenes to your content to elevate your films.
 
 Smooth Focusing
 
 Low-Angle Shots
 
 More Creative Ideas To Be Unveiled
 
Noise Reduction Optimise For All Scenes 
Compared to the last two generations, Slypod Pro has greatly improved on its noise level which is only around 5 decibels during operation. The Slypod Pro is the best creator tool for wedding and interview filming.

MOZA Master APP allows Slypod Pro to be linked with a MOZA gimbal, enabling 4-axis motion control for professional-level creative possibilities. 
 
 
 
 
Use the MOZA Master App and a smartphone to perform precise movements at variable speeds, program movements, and more.
 
Hi-Precesion Motion Control Made Easy
Experience the Ultra-high power drive motor technology that powers the Mars rover at your fingertips, with an unmatched precision movement of 1mm and acceleration from 0 to 10,000rpm in only 10 microseconds (1/100000s). 
 
 
The stiff carbon fiber body of Slypod Pro is ultra-lightweight and strong. The internally geared motor provides steady and smooth camera movement. The Slypod Pro is capable of supporting anything from a smartphone to large cameras, and most stabilizers. 
 
Weather Proof Design
The intelligent mechanical design provides Slypod Pro with maintenance-free performance, protecting the built-in transmission system from wind, sand, and dust.

 
 
Slypod Pro is compatible with all types of mirrorless or DSLR cameras, tripods, and a wide range of gimbals on the market. 
 
 Unlimited Power Supply 
The super built-in battery provides the Slypod Pro with up to 4 hours of run-time. It can also be charged by an external power supply for continuous shooting. With the enhanced power supply, creativity always shines. 
 
Optional Accessories for Better Experience
The intelligent modular design of Slypod Pro allows universal compatibility with most camera accessories and motion control systems for your indoor and outdoor filming setups. The quick and easy setup allows you to get in action in just a few seconds.

 As an Indiegogo Backer, you will receive priority beta test access (via TestFlight), so you can directly influence the app's development.    ProCamera is an award-winning “Swiss Army Knife” for iOS photography, bursting with state-of-the-art technology for photography, video, and editing.  Obscura brings the kind of controls you’d expect from a professional DSLR to your iPhone. Designed with intuitive controls, ergonomic design and beautiful filters, Obscura is the camera that gets out of your way.  Obscura will work seamlessly with Fjorden when it ships.  We love Moment's M-Series lenses, so we’ve made Fjorden’s iPhone MagSafe cases compatible with them. The Moment M-Series lens mount (available for all iPhone 12 and future models) series snaps right into our Fjorden iPhone 12-series MagSafe cases. When you're done shooting, Fjorden serves as a fully adjustable iPhone kickstand. Use it in portrait mode for video calls or notifications on your desk; rotate it to landscape mode for watching Netflix with your morning coffee.  With its quick-release clip, Fjorden snaps in and out of the Fjorden MagSafe cases in less than a second. When you upgrade your iPhone, simply swap Fjorden over to your new device.   Fjorden's iPhone cases for iPhone series 11, 12, and future iPhones are MagSafe-compatible. Easily mount them onto wireless chargers, car mounts, or MagSafe tripods.   Fjorden connects via Bluetooth and lets you shoot remotely using a tripod — perfect for shake-free night- and astrophotography.   A standard CR2032 coin cell provides up to 12 months of battery life and is easily swapped via the battery tray.  In decisive moments, Fjorden gives you speed and precision. It's discreet and doesn't draw attention. Control exposure to play with architectural shapes and shadows, create light trails at night, capture the feeling of your city.   Pocket-friendly, super-light, and with year-long battery life, Fjorden lets you bring a pro compact camera everywhere.

We're offering a two-year warranty and a full 30-day money-back guarantee.

The Unleashed puts complete control over your DSLR into the palm of your hand – right from your smartphone. It’s the first DSLR remote control that you won’t even notice is there. It becomes one with the camera’s design and won’t get in the way of what you love doing: taking photos and videos.
 
     We are proud to announce a cooperation between foolography and Triggertrap and making our Unleashed compatible with the Triggertrap app, and the Triggertrap app compatible with the Unleashed. You can use both our app as well as all the cool triggering features of the Triggertrap app that people might already be used to, but now wirelessly with your Unleashed!   Developing the Unleashed, we had one big design goal: it’s tiny size. You can leave the Unleashed on the camera at all times, even when packing it into your bag. The hot shoe stays free so you can keep using your external or popup flash, LED panels or shotgun mics.   The Unleashed is the first wireless remote that gives you complete control over your DSLR – as if it was still in your hands. Experience a professionally designed app for Android and iOS that lets you change all the important settings: aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, exposure compensation and much more.   With this you can easily get the perfect shot, no matter if you’re behind or in front of the camera, right next to it or further away. Change settings and trigger at the right moment– without even touching the camera. Experience a professionally designed app for Android and iOS Startrails by Oliver Everyone loves videos. So do we. The Unleashed lets you start and stop videos from a distance and easily adjust your settings for the next scene or while you film.     We designed the Unleashed to be ready whenever you want to use it. It doesn’t need to be charged, and automatically reconnects to your smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy so you don’t need to reconfigure your wifi settings each time you shoot remotely! It’s Plug’n’Play and always ready to use.   One of the biggest advantages of digital photography is the possibility to instantly see results. This is too cool to miss when shooting remotely, so the Unleashed will send a thumbnail to your smartphone for quick review and checking exposure. And if needed, simply adjust the settings right from your smartphone to get that shot you wanted!      Wireless remote control is vital for vibration free long exposures, breathtaking startrails, as well as epic timelapses. The Unleashed allows interval shooting and even supports carefully controlled exposure ramping for smooth day to night transitions – the “holy grail” of timelapses. In addition to setting the exposure ramp manually as depicted, we are working on a fully automatic mode with the help of Gunther Wegner, the author of LRTimelapse - the de facto standard in timelapse post production software.

<h3><strong>Hello!</strong></h3>
<p>MAYA is an enlarger timer that is designed help you create beautiful prints in your darkroom by offering you all the functionality you'll probably ever need. It can also help you develop your film by timing your development, fixing and other processes and with the modular interface, it might even one day develop your film and slow cook your food for you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/edPswofq5DRWmKkQow/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/82UH4tDGrLQ1ry7aA4/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We've started working on the project a few seconds after our old darkroom timer broke down. Realizing all the possible replacements were either lacking almost everything we'd like to have in a timer or having absolutely horrible interfaces with requiring button push combinations and no clear display to communicate with you, we took the matters into our own hands and started building a better product.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548707065/ysjawoxgcay7vr2v9odv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even though we've started designing MAYA for our own use in the first place, getting it out there for the whole analog community was always something we had in mind. We wanted to give something capable to well seasoned master printers so that their prints will be even easier to make and at the same time, we always wanted to give a warm welcome to the newcomes to the world of enlarging.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548707314/susmvl56dszn56nwysfr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For those who are on a budget or simply dislike seeing lots of lights in their faces, we knew we had to create a simpler alternative that would also be cheaper. However, all the core functionality had to be there. So maybe for the first time ever, we are democratising the F-Stop adjustments, test strip modes and almost all the other features that the most expensive timers have. That's right, our cheaper MAYA White Edition hardly is an entry model. Where it differs from the Black Edition is the interface, extension capability and the choice of materials. </p>

<p>Finally, we've reached a point in the prototyping phase where we're happy to present you with. So, here it is.</p>

<h3><strong>FEATURES </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Easy to Use Interface</strong></p>
<p>With the clean interface and dual rotary dials, you can quickly navigate between the menus and manipulate settings. You don't have to remember button combinations or try to decipher meaningless error codes, everything is displayed very clearly on the main LCD. And when you are ready, all you have to do is to press the Focus or the Expose buttons to direcly access the most important functions.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>F Stop Based... Everything</strong></p>
<p>If you are remotely interested in photography, you've probably heard of stops. All the exposure values in both photographing and printing are related to each other. Which means you can change your aperture one stop (from f/8 to f/5.6 for example) and compensate that with one stop of a change in the exposure time.</p>
<p>In darkroom practice, you can also speak in F-Stops or Exposure Values (EV) when you want to modify your print in a particular way. If you want your subject to appear slightly brighter, you can decrease the exposure time by 1/3 stops or if you want a much darker background, you can go for a 1.5 stop longer exposure.</p>
<p>Since they are so practical to think in, we've implemented F-Stop editing anywhere we could. You can edit in EV when you're adjusting your base time, when you want to add a dodge or burn time or you can even specify EV increments between your test strips. </p>
<p>Everything will be much faster to work with. You no longer have to guess what 1/4 stops of burning would require for a sky that was exposed for 43"" at f/11.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting the Base Time in 0.1 Seconds and/or EV (F-Stop) Mode</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/jxG2k2QFVMGBDI4yNi/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/vuPiEywcAjBoVg3GtI/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It is very easy to set a time for countdown and you can even modify it in either seconds or F-stop values. The left dial makes large adjustments while the right one makes smaller adjustments. While under 10 seconds, the left one adds or subtracts 1"" to your base time while the right one does the same with 0.1"". Over 10 seconds, they become much faster and add/subtract 10"" and 1"" respectively. In the F-Stop mode, they adjust in 1 EV and 0.1 EV respectively. </p>
<p><strong>Test Strip Mode with EV Steps</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/lYhfJN5OVhbQtuPW47/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Timing test strips is easier than ever. Having an F-Stop based strip mode makes it so much easier to nail down the required base time, even with papers and negatives you don't have experience with.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550123334/bdgl0jr0gyv9xvxvmwn1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since each individual exposure time is automatically calculated within a set F-Stop difference of each other (as opposed to simply increasing it by 5"" each time), you'll get even exposure differences between each test strip instead of all the darker ones looking similar to each other while the brighter ones have significant jumps in exposure.</p>
<p>You can decide on the number of strips you want as well as the EV difference between them. You can have your starting value as the middle strip or the shortest exposure time. You can even choose to do all your strips on a single piece of paper or individual ones. And you can set your favorite settings as the default mode so you'll never have to adjust them every single time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/kiX9OG8vzeDjUDmnyA/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You got your base time in the ballpark but you want to refine it further? You can go to your preferred settings for the REFINE mode with a single click and do a test with a much tighter spread. Once again, you can set the defaults for this mode so all you have to do is simply click REFINE after selecting your candidate from the initial run.</p>

<p>You can record up to 9 separate dodge and burn actions per memory channel. After doing the base exposure, MAYA will remind you which dodge/burn areas you've set and how long you need to expose them for. All adjustments are EV based so all you have to do is to enter how much lighter/darker you want a particular area. You can even set them separately for each filter while doing split grade printing.</p>

<p>Having two channels per memory bank, you can use them for split grade printing. The grade display will remind you which filter you have to use. Each channel stores and recalls separate base times along with dodge and burn times. </p>

<p>You've changed the aperture on your lens, paper size or simply you want to manually adjust your settings by some amount? MAYA will take care of all the calculations. You just enter in the values you want. You can even compensate both memory channels if you're doing split grade printing.

<p>Even though both models have twin channels for split grade printing (or simply for working on two prints at once), Black Edition takes it several steps further by offering 6 memory banks, each with two channels. That way you can save all your settings for a negative that you print often, go back and forth between two variations of a single print, have multiple people use MAYA without disturbing each other's print recipes or use one memory position to time the paper developer and toning, which will give you much more consistent results.</p>

<p>This wasn't the main goal when we started developing MAYA but since everything that is needed is already in, we simply said why not.</p>
<p>Select your film and developer settings from the list or simply add a custom one. Then enter the recommended development time. The whole development will be timed and you'll be reminded to agitate the tank at required times (every minute or every 30 seconds as you've chosen). You'll also get a visual and audible notification towards the end to pour out. You can even use the memory banks (separately from the darkroom timer memory banks) to store your favorite development settings and get consistent development each and every time.</p>
<p>What is more? We are also working on a thermometer module so that MAYA will compensate the development time for the changes in chemicals' temperature.</p>

<p>At the current point, we need some time and money to go on with developing this product any further. What we also need to see is how many of you are interested in this project. We've talked to many photographers of different experience levels to determine what needs to be in the design, now we need to know how many of you are out there. </p>
<p>In short, we need to have a better idea on the market size to determine what the final shape of the product will be. 50 of us out there? This'll be a boutique, handmade, hand assembled product. 250 of us are enough to turn this into a semi-mass produced product with a different finish, maybe material choices and production methods, as well as some interesting add-ons. 1000s of us analog photographers? That means we'll have the budget to use even more sophisticated production methods, start working on some really interesting projects.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549890101/qhbx6ubnuuheruxsigwp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>No matter what, we will keep on working on various add-ons, accessories and even bigger things such as SD-Card reader to save your recipes, multigrade controllers for enlarger heads with built in filters, thermometers to measure your developers and auto-compensate development times and even a fully automated film processor and a completely new LED multigrade enlarger from the ground up! A more successful campaign will only make things much faster.</p>

<p>Like the promises but you have something more in mind? From the day one, we've had the idea of making the project go open-source at one point. Some elements of the hardware and software will be shared publicly, so you can develop your own sensors, buttons, a custom power unit and even a relay box for your own needs. </p>
<p>If everything goes well and we become confident in going full open source, we will certainly do so as it'll only benefit all parties involved. If we receive the funds to develop a stable and flexible platform for all of our (both us and you!) darkroom needs, we're hoping to release both the firmware and the hardware specs so anyone can develop and carry the whole project to points we can't even imagine at this point.</p>

<p>You like the idea, you'd like to use MAYA as a film developer but you don't have a darkroom yet? No worries, you can simply buy MAYA and start using it as a film developer with auto temperature compensation. If you ever build yourself a darkroom later on, you can always choose to buy one of the power units to make it enlarger-capable. </p>

<p>You want the whole deal... We can't blame you. After all, we did the whole design around this package and if you like all the bells and whistles (Lights and buttons in this case), this is the one you need.

<p>We are already deep into our prototyping phase. Most of the coding has been done, interface has been designed, so apart from the finishing touches here and there, we need to find a supplier for the PCBs, various parts and the casing. Of course, the final physical form of everything can only be determined after we have a good number of how many units we'll have to make. More than a few dozen units and we'll be able to afford custom made electronic boards, extruded aluminium chassis and even injection molding.  In more limited numbers, we'll have to stick to off-the-shelf electronic modules and a folded chassis with laser cut plates.</p>

<p>The exact design of the interface will be finalized after the crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>We're already in touch with some manufacturers but to order various prototypes, we need the funds and some time. Here's the schedule we have in mind at the moment:</p>
<p>Early April 2019: Order Pre-Release PCB</p>
<p>Late April 2019: Finalize the case design and get some prototypes made</p>
<p>May 2019: Final testing, Order Release Candidate PCB and casing</p>
<p>Late June/Early July 2019: First batch delivery</p>
<p>Late July 2019: Second batch delivery</p>
<p>Late August 2019: Third batch delivery</p>
<p>Having a healthier funding will let us go through more prototypes in less time and also start working on all the other projects that we've mentioned above. We'll also be able to afford more industrial production methods such as prebuilt PCBs so even though we'll end up spending more time on the design phase, the production phase will be much easier on us so we'll still be able to respect the delivery dates we've suggested above.</p>
<p>Hope you've liked what you've seen and we honestly hope there are enough darkroom printers in the world so we can elevate this project to a point where a new era of analog photography related gear can be based on. </p>
<p>Even if you're not interested in participating in this crowdfunding project, please, spread the word. Drop us a line. Share a comment. Discuss your own ideas and criticise ours! There have been a great collaboration for this project by quite a few members of the online analog communities so even if you can't physically help this project reach its goal, let us know that we have some support.</p>

</div></div>","Hello!
MAYA is an enlarger timer that is designed help you create beautiful prints in your darkroom by offering you all the functionality you'll probably ever need. It can also help you develop your film by timing your development, fixing and other processes and with the modular interface, it might even one day develop your film and slow cook your food for you!


We've started working on the project a few seconds after our old darkroom timer broke down. Realizing all the possible replacements were either lacking almost everything we'd like to have in a timer or having absolutely horrible interfaces with requiring button push combinations and no clear display to communicate with you, we took the matters into our own hands and started building a better product.

Even though we've started designing MAYA for our own use in the first place, getting it out there for the whole analog community was always something we had in mind. We wanted to give something capable to well seasoned master printers so that their prints will be even easier to make and at the same time, we always wanted to give a warm welcome to the newcomes to the world of enlarging.

For those who are on a budget or simply dislike seeing lots of lights in their faces, we knew we had to create a simpler alternative that would also be cheaper. However, all the core functionality had to be there. So maybe for the first time ever, we are democratising the F-Stop adjustments, test strip modes and almost all the other features that the most expensive timers have. That's right, our cheaper MAYA White Edition hardly is an entry model. Where it differs from the Black Edition is the interface, extension capability and the choice of materials. 



Finally, we've reached a point in the prototyping phase where we're happy to present you with. So, here it is.

 
 

FEATURES 
Easy to Use Interface
With the clean interface and dual rotary dials, you can quickly navigate between the menus and manipulate settings. You don't have to remember button combinations or try to decipher meaningless error codes, everything is displayed very clearly on the main LCD. And when you are ready, all you have to do is to press the Focus or the Expose buttons to direcly access the most important functions.



 
F Stop Based... Everything
If you are remotely interested in photography, you've probably heard of stops. All the exposure values in both photographing and printing are related to each other. Which means you can change your aperture one stop (from f/8 to f/5.6 for example) and compensate that with one stop of a change in the exposure time.
In darkroom practice, you can also speak in F-Stops or Exposure Values (EV) when you want to modify your print in a particular way. If you want your subject to appear slightly brighter, you can decrease the exposure time by 1/3 stops or if you want a much darker background, you can go for a 1.5 stop longer exposure.
Since they are so practical to think in, we've implemented F-Stop editing anywhere we could. You can edit in EV when you're adjusting your base time, when you want to add a dodge or burn time or you can even specify EV increments between your test strips. 
Everything will be much faster to work with. You no longer have to guess what 1/4 stops of burning would require for a sky that was exposed for 43"" at f/11.
Adjusting the Base Time in 0.1 Seconds and/or EV (F-Stop) Mode


It is very easy to set a time for countdown and you can even modify it in either seconds or F-stop values. The left dial makes large adjustments while the right one makes smaller adjustments. While under 10 seconds, the left one adds or subtracts 1"" to your base time while the right one does the same with 0.1"". Over 10 seconds, they become much faster and add/subtract 10"" and 1"" respectively. In the F-Stop mode, they adjust in 1 EV and 0.1 EV respectively. 
Test Strip Mode with EV Steps

Timing test strips is easier than ever. Having an F-Stop based strip mode makes it so much easier to nail down the required base time, even with papers and negatives you don't have experience with.

Since each individual exposure time is automatically calculated within a set F-Stop difference of each other (as opposed to simply increasing it by 5"" each time), you'll get even exposure differences between each test strip instead of all the darker ones looking similar to each other while the brighter ones have significant jumps in exposure.
You can decide on the number of strips you want as well as the EV difference between them. You can have your starting value as the middle strip or the shortest exposure time. You can even choose to do all your strips on a single piece of paper or individual ones. And you can set your favorite settings as the default mode so you'll never have to adjust them every single time.

You got your base time in the ballpark but you want to refine it further? You can go to your preferred settings for the REFINE mode with a single click and do a test with a much tighter spread. Once again, you can set the defaults for this mode so all you have to do is simply click REFINE after selecting your candidate from the initial run.
F-Stop Based Dodge and Burn Timers

You can record up to 9 separate dodge and burn actions per memory channel. After doing the base exposure, MAYA will remind you which dodge/burn areas you've set and how long you need to expose them for. All adjustments are EV based so all you have to do is to enter how much lighter/darker you want a particular area. You can even set them separately for each filter while doing split grade printing.
Split Grade Channels

Having two channels per memory bank, you can use them for split grade printing. The grade display will remind you which filter you have to use. Each channel stores and recalls separate base times along with dodge and burn times. 
Compensation with Smart Resize, Aperture Compensation and Dry-down Offset

You've changed the aperture on your lens, paper size or simply you want to manually adjust your settings by some amount? MAYA will take care of all the calculations. You just enter in the values you want. You can even compensate both memory channels if you're doing split grade printing. You can also specify an offset amount to give you more headroom for dry-down or toning.
Memory Channels

Even though both models have twin channels for split grade printing (or simply for working on two prints at once), Black Edition takes it several steps further by offering 6 memory banks, each with two channels. That way you can save all your settings for a negative that you print often, go back and forth between two variations of a single print, have multiple people use MAYA without disturbing each other's print recipes or use one memory position to time the paper developer and toning, which will give you much more consistent results.

 
Here are some videos of the prototype in use:

FILM DEVELOPER MODE

This wasn't the main goal when we started developing MAYA but since everything that is needed is already in, we simply said why not.
Select your film and developer settings from the list or simply add a custom one. Then enter the recommended development time. The whole development will be timed and you'll be reminded to agitate the tank at required times (every minute or every 30 seconds as you've chosen). You'll also get a visual and audible notification towards the end to pour out. You can even use the memory banks (separately from the darkroom timer memory banks) to store your favorite development settings and get consistent development each and every time.
What is more? We are also working on a thermometer module so that MAYA will compensate the development time for the changes in chemicals' temperature.
 
POWER BARS

Unless you want to turn your enlarger off and on manually, you'll also need a power bar. If all you want to do is develop some film or make prints without any automation, you obviously don't need these.
The power bars will both power MAYA and your other darkroom tools such as your enlargers, safelight, room light and maybe a paper flasher you've built. All sockets are connected to internal relays so they'll automatically be switched off and on as required.

For the most basic functions, which is enlarger and safelight control, PB2 with two power sockets will suffice. For more complicated tasks, PB3 and PB4 are recommended which have 3 and 4 sockets respectively. All sockets are reprogrammable as an enlarger, safelight, roomlight, paper flasher and a second enlarger. The more sockets you have, the more flexible the whole setup becomes. 
ACCESSORIES
You can choose to have footswitches, desk switches, hand remotes to trigger various functions such as countdown, focus, split grade channels and even toggle your room lights between red and white.

You can assign two different functions and select them by using the sliding switch. You can attach masks using paper clips to use when making a test strip, dodging and burning and start the exposure, change the split grade channel and start your second exposure without taking your hands off. 
 

Compact and easy to use by hand. Has a slide switch to select between two assigned functions and has a big, soft and red button to trigger it. Can be used on a desk or can be attached to the side of the enlarger.
 

Slightly harder to press by hand but since it's made of metal, it's usable as a footswitch. Can be assigned a single function.
 

Usable on your workbench or on the floor, each of the metal switches can be assigned to trigger different functions. 
 

You can also make your own remotes or use the ones you have (from almost any brand, even guitar amp and tattoo machine footswitches can be used). The required adapters, schematics for building your own remote and the physical interface (type of accessory port) will be announced later on.

We've talked to many photographers of different experience levels to determine what needs to be in the design, now we need to know how many of you are out there. 
In short, we need to have a better idea on the market size to determine what the final shape of the product will be. 50 of us out there? This'll be a boutique, handmade, hand assembled product. 250 of us are enough to turn this into a semi-mass produced product with a different finish, maybe material choices and production methods, as well as some interesting add-ons. 1000s of us analog photographers? That means we'll have the budget to use even more sophisticated production methods, start working on some really interesting projects.

No matter what, we will keep on working on various add-ons, accessories and even bigger things such as SD-Card reader to save your recipes, multigrade controllers for enlarger heads with built in filters, thermometers to measure your developers and auto-compensate development times and even a fully automated film processor and a completely new LED multigrade enlarger from the ground up! A more successful campaign will only make things much faster.



Like the promises but you have something more in mind? From the day one, we've had the idea of making the project go open-source at one point. Some elements of the hardware and software will be shared publicly, so you can develop your own sensors, buttons, a custom power unit and even a relay box for your own needs. 
If everything goes well and we become confident in going full open source, we will certainly do so as it'll only benefit all parties involved. If we receive the funds to develop a stable and flexible platform for all of our (both us and you!) darkroom needs, we're hoping to release both the firmware and the hardware specs so anyone can develop and carry the whole project to points we can't even imagine at this point.

Here are the ways you can contribute:


Did you know we also make one of the better designed leather camera straps on the market? Whether or not you want to participate in one of the more serious perks, you can choose to buy a $15 gift card, valid in our Etsy Store, for only $10.
 

 
You like the idea, you'd like to use MAYA as a film developer but you don't have a darkroom yet? No worries, you can simply buy MAYA and start using it as a film developer with auto temperature compensation. If you ever build yourself a darkroom later on, you can always choose to buy one of the power units to make it enlarger-capable. 

You want the enlarger control along with the safelight control and all the features we have built in but don't exactly need the Black Edition interface? This one is for you. 
 

For those who are slightly more ambitious, which means those who need a 3-socket power unit. Guessing it's for the room light control, which is one of our favorite functions. Or do you have something else in your mind? Care to share?
 

You want the whole deal... We can't blame you. After all, we did the whole design around this package and if you like all the bells and whistles (Lights and buttons in this case), this is the one you need. Comes with a 3-plug power unit so  you can control both your safelight AND your room light. Or maybe a paper flasher? Also available as an Early Bird package! Also also comes with a free remote of your choice!

The truly ambitious package. You didn't only like the the full package, you want to go beyond it. For whatever reason, you need those 4 sockets. Maybe for a second enlarger. Maybe just in case... Whatever you have in mind, we're throwing in two remotes of your choice for you. Enjoy!

This is getting really interesting. What are you buying it for? Are you buying for a school? Are you one of the last remaining photo labs in your area? We'd certainly like to have a chat with you.
For other group purchases, please don't hesitate to reach us.



We are already deep into our prototyping phase. Most of the coding has been done, interface has been designed, so apart from the finishing touches here and there, we need to find a supplier for the PCBs, various parts and the casing. Of course, the final physical form of everything can only be determined after we have a good number of how many units we'll have to make. More than a few dozen units and we'll be able to afford custom made electronic boards, extruded aluminium chassis and even injection molding.  In more limited numbers, we'll have to stick to off-the-shelf electronic modules and a folded chassis with laser cut plates.
Alternative Sketches






The exact design of the interface will be finalized after the crowdfunding campaign.
We're already in touch with some manufacturers but to order various prototypes, we need the funds and some time. Here's the schedule we have in mind at the moment:
Early April 2019: Order Pre-Release PCB
Late April 2019: Finalize the case design and get some prototypes made
May 2019: Final testing, Order Release Candidate PCB and casing
Late June/Early July 2019: First batch delivery
Late July 2019: Second batch delivery
Late August 2019: Third batch delivery
Having a healthier funding will let us go through more prototypes in less time and also start working on all the other projects that we've mentioned above. We'll also be able to afford more industrial production methods such as prebuilt PCBs so even though we'll end up spending more time on the design phase, the production phase will be much easier on us so we'll still be able to respect the delivery dates we've suggested above.
Hope you've liked what you've seen and we honestly hope there are enough darkroom printers in the world so we can elevate this project to a point where a new era of analog photography related gear can be based on. 
Even if you're not interested in participating in this crowdfunding project, please, spread the word. Drop us a line. Share a comment. Discuss your own ideas and criticise ours! There have been a great collaboration for this project by quite a few members of the online analog communities so even if you can't physically help this project reach its goal, let us know that we have some support.

<p>As everyone else, we have been facing the desire to automate our homes, but we, as lot’s of you, were facing a market with many smart home solutions which are either proprietary based protocols or very limited expandability.<br/><br/>Two and a half years ago we came together to develop a solution that will become the center of our and hopefully your smart home – integrating all modern IoT standards with a groundbreaking home security camera that will not only be as versatile as no other camera ever before, but also become a real jewel in your home or office. Throughout our journey, more and more people have joined our project adding their ideas to the final product, making it as a versatile gadget for any situation: be it a single room bachelor apartment or a 2 story family house with a dog and two children.<br/><br/>After drafting the idea and looking for available solutions, we experimented extensively, creating several designs and multiple prototypes until we found a solution that seamlessly combines sophisticated electrical engineering, like our patented stabilized levitation technology within a state of the art design.<br/><br/>We have partnered with award-winning software and hardware engineers, that have worked on several other large-scale industrial projects to make sure that the final product meets our and your highest expectations.<br/><br/>28 Months later we stand here with a product with patented technology ready for mass production and are extremely excited to introduce the Moon by 1-Ring to the world.<br/><br/>We hope you will like and support our pursuit for a better, easy to use and beautiful Smart Home!</p>

</div></div>","The Moon by 1-Ring is the most advanced and versatile Smart Home Solution and a Security Camera in the world.It features a revolutionary stabilized 360° levitation technology and allows easy integration of modern Smart Home and legacy devices into your personal Internet of Things. 

 

 
 
The proprietary technology used in the Moon provides for a noiseless, jerk-free and fully controllable levitation that has no equal on the consumer market. The Moon by 1-Ring can rotate smoothly and without delay in any direction and is charged wirelessly for 24/7 uninterrupted operation.
 

 
 
 



 
 


 

Unite your home and office appliances into your very own Internet of Things using the Moon by 1-Ring as the central Smart Hub. Combining major home automation standards, inbuilt sensors and a programmable IR Blaster the Moon by 1-Ring allows you to remotely control your home from anywhere in the world. Automate your daily routines with the moon Commander app to make the most out of your free time.
 

 

 

 
Should the Moon by 1-Ring detect movement or noise it will automatically rotate towards it, take a snapshot or respond in a predefined way. You can also take direct control of the camera to record a video, make a snapshot or communicate two-way at any time. 



 
 
 


 
 

 The Moon by 1-Ring's easily customizable Guard Mode will help keep both your home and office safe and secure e.g integrating a home alarm, or using our built-in Presence Simulation tool to let the Moon by 1-Ring occasionally switch on lights and other devices in a realistic pattern. Video chatting with your family or working together with colleagues abroad has never been easier or felt more natural. Connect the Moon by 1-Ring to a conference application of choice and use it as an interactive webcam. High-quality speakers and noise-canceling microphones ensure that you truly are a participant in any meeting, not just an observer.              
     
  

As everyone else, we have been facing the desire to automate our homes, but we, as lot’s of you, were facing a market with many smart home solutions which are either proprietary based protocols or very limited expandability.Two and a half years ago we came together to develop a solution that will become the center of our and hopefully your smart home – integrating all modern IoT standards with a groundbreaking home security camera that will not only be as versatile as no other camera ever before, but also become a real jewel in your home or office. Throughout our journey, more and more people have joined our project adding their ideas to the final product, making it as a versatile gadget for any situation: be it a single room bachelor apartment or a 2 story family house with a dog and two children.After drafting the idea and looking for available solutions, we experimented extensively, creating several designs and multiple prototypes until we found a solution that seamlessly combines sophisticated electrical engineering, like our patented stabilized levitation technology within a state of the art design.We have partnered with award-winning software and hardware engineers, that have worked on several other large-scale industrial projects to make sure that the final product meets our and your highest expectations.28 Months later we stand here with a product with patented technology ready for mass production and are extremely excited to introduce the Moon by 1-Ring to the world.We hope you will like and support our pursuit for a better, easy to use and beautiful Smart Home!

 


 

In addition to Moonlight Silver color, we unlocked two additional colors Galactic grey and Star White!

What is the range?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: GearEye may scan in up to three meters range, depending on a tag used.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: Do I need to charge anything?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: The GearTags don’t need to be charged as they are battery-free and last for years. <br/>The Dongle needs recharging, but it easily lasts a full shooting day.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: Can I purchase additional GearTags? How much will they cost?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, they will be sold separately at the end of the campaign at an average cost of $10 for 20 tags (5 metal + 10 non-metal tags).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: Can I customize my lists on the app?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Of course, you can have up to 10 personalized lists, with up to 50 different items in each.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: What can I stick the GearTags on?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: You can stick the GearTags to basically every item you want to keep track of. Different GearTags are for different items, depending on their size and material. There are GearTags for metal items and regular tags for other material.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: Is GearEye suitable only for photographers?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Definitely not. GearEye is for anyone who wants to keep an eye on important belongings, travellers, makeup artists, sound engineers, parents and more.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: Why is this better than other trackers?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Most of the other trackers are BLE tags. They are bulky and cannot be attached to the most of tiny items everyone has. Moreover, their accuracy is bad and there is no way to verify that the item is inside the bag or 3 meter from it. Bluetooth tags have battery inside, which is either replaced after a few months when it dies, or thrown away together with a tag. <br/>GearTags are incredibly thin, battery-free, and can last for years without replacement. They’re so cheap, with 40 RFID tags costing less than one Bluetooth tag, so we can put tags on anything. And with GearTag the chances of leaving something behind are much smaller.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: What RF technology are you using?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: We use EPC Gen 2, UHF 860-950 MHz band, depending on specific country's regulations.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: How do I check that I have all my gear?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Tap the ""Check"" button and scan the area of your bag with the tagged items. If you're using the Dongle it is best to hold it together with your phone. All the items in the bag will be checked with a V mark that they're in place. If an item is missing (withot V mark) you can tap on it, and GearEye app will guide you to the lost item using graphics and sounds.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q</strong>: How do I tag an item?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Tap the ""Check"" button and scan the area of your bag with the tagged items.

FIRST, we made sure we can make a product that actually works and that we'd want to use, only then we decided to crowdfund it.We're in this to make people happy. The only way to do this is to be 100% transparent. Here's a short video that shows what our electronics can do:

 Crowdfunders' Fund helps creators with great products finance great campaigns.   Tross is a creative agency that specializes in crowdfunding campaigns and performance marketing.    FAQQ:  Will the GearEye app work with both iOs and Android?A: Yes. Q: How far can GearEye scan the tags? What is the range?A: GearEye may scan in up to three meters range, depending on a tag used. Q: Do I need to charge anything?A: The GearTags don’t need to be charged as they are battery-free and last for years. The Dongle needs recharging, but it easily lasts a full shooting day. Q: Can I purchase additional GearTags? How much will they cost?A: Yes, they will be sold separately at the end of the campaign at an average cost of $10 for 20 tags (5 metal + 10 non-metal tags). Q: Can I customize my lists on the app?A: Of course, you can have up to 10 personalized lists, with up to 50 different items in each. Q: What can I stick the GearTags on?A: You can stick the GearTags to basically every item you want to keep track of. Different GearTags are for different items, depending on their size and material. There are GearTags for metal items and regular tags for other material. Q: Is GearEye suitable only for photographers?A: Definitely not. GearEye is for anyone who wants to keep an eye on important belongings, travellers, makeup artists, sound engineers, parents and more. Q: Why is this better than other trackers?A: Most of the other trackers are BLE tags. They are bulky and cannot be attached to the most of tiny items everyone has. Moreover, their accuracy is bad and there is no way to verify that the item is inside the bag or 3 meter from it. Bluetooth tags have battery inside, which is either replaced after a few months when it dies, or thrown away together with a tag. GearTags are incredibly thin, battery-free, and can last for years without replacement. They’re so cheap, with 40 RFID tags costing less than one Bluetooth tag, so we can put tags on anything. And with GearTag the chances of leaving something behind are much smaller. Q: What RF technology are you using?A: We use EPC Gen 2, UHF 860-950 MHz band, depending on specific country's regulations. Q: How do I check that I have all my gear?A: Tap the ""Check"" button and scan the area of your bag with the tagged items. If you're using the Dongle it is best to hold it together with your phone. All the items in the bag will be checked with a V mark that they're in place. If an item is missing (withot V mark) you can tap on it, and GearEye app will guide you to the lost item using graphics and sounds. Q: How do I tag an item?A: Tap the ""Check"" button and scan the area of your bag with the tagged items. If you're using the Dongle it is best to hold it together with your phone. All the items in the bag will be checked with a V mark that they're in place. If an item is missing (withot V mark) you can tap on it, and GearEye app will guide you to the lost item using graphics and sounds. Q: What if I lose the phone on which the app is installed? Can I track it via a laptop or desktop?A: There will be a web-interface, so you can easily find through it, or share your lists with your friend and look through any other device/app (authentication is required). Q: What is special about the GearTags?A: The GearTags are RFID tracking stickers which means they never have to be charged. They have a strong adhesive so they can be placed on practically every item you think of. The GearTags come in different sizes and are incredibly thin. Q: I would like to become a GearEye reseller. How do I do that?A: You can use the contact form on our website. Tell us about your business and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.",39.0,0,"1 Campaign

With these smart vision abilities, Wunder360 S1 could be able to estimate accurate depth map from even a single 360 degree footage.Once the depth maps are generated, our 3D reconstruction engine (containing the computer vision technology called SLAM: simultaneous mapping and localization), kicks in and calculates the position of the camera, while drawing the 3D point cloud of the environment. The 3D models and virtual tours will be done after all this processing.Original ImageDepth Image How does the Phantom Clipper work?We applied an advanced computer vision technology called DCNN background subtraction to segment the moving target from a video sequence. This algorithm learns environment information from the videos, and automatically recognizes the moving targets, such as human body, pets, and vehicles. Then the Wunder360 App will put all the segmented foregrounds with a clean background for the final Photon Clipper animation. Design Technical specifications PerksCalling all early adopters!

<h3>Introducing AFX by CDA-TEK</h3>
<p>The AFX is a comprehensive auto and manual focus control system for Blackmagic Pocket 4K and 6K cinema cameras as well as offering motor based control of manual focus lenses on all other cameras.</p>
<p>For Blackmagic Pocket 4K and 6K cinema cameras using native MFT/EF electronic lenses, there is no requirement for external focus motors and the AFX also supports adapted EF lenses on the Pocket 4K with compatible adapters.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603752062/nyzzyypw2tc4telahaic.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Powered by its own internal rechargeable battery, the AFX is a self contained unit which requires no cabling and communicates wirelessly over Bluetooth to your camera.</p>
<p>Originally conceived as an add on to our PBC controller, the AFX now also incorporates the full capabilities of the PBC so is a completely self contained system.</p>
<p>In addition, the AFX also incorporates an interface for Tilta Nucleus M and N motors to provide its auto and manual focus functionality to any lens on any camera.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603752158/eklham7wuf8xx53xqsq3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the heart of the AFX is a LIDAR sensor that constantly measures the distance to the nearest central object, which the AFX then processes to move the focus position of the lens to the correct calibrated position.</p>
<p>Using this method, the lens moves immediately and consistently to the focus position, so unlike other image based auto focus systems, not only is there no focus hunting but its performance is not impacted in low light.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603752300/rpo5hbigvigwun4wxzsz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Included with the AFX is a compact wireless remote which allows you to control its different operational modes and functions as well as manually control focus.</p>
<p>This compact controller can also be used to change an array of settings on your Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera such as aperture, ISO and white balance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603752370/juduf2d7gujnwwrwaaqa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The AFX screen provides full monitoring of the current status of these parameters as well as an alternative measured distance indicator screen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603752492/cabbq4jbjs3egyiibxpm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The AFX provides two auto focus modes; AFS and AFC.</p>
<p>In AFS mode, the lens is refocused on the nearest central object when the trigger on the controller is pressed and remains at that position until the trigger is pressed again or you manually refocus.</p>
<p>In AFC mode, the lens is continuously re-focused on the nearest central object enabling you to track a person walking towards the camera for example.</p>
<p>Using the controller you can instantly switch between AFS, AFC and manual focus modes and to provide smoother focus changes, you are also able to select four automatic transition times between focus points in the two auto modes.</p>
<p>The AFX also has an additional transition mode called Natural that automatically adjusts the focus transition time dependent upon the distance between the current and new focus position.</p>
<p>To provide you with even more focus assistance functionality, the AFX has a mode called QuadLock.</p>
<p>Using QuadLock, you can quickly store four focus positions using either the LIDAR sensor or manually and then switch between them instantly or with the currently set transition time applied.</p>
<p>An additional switched option in QuadLock allows you to manually move focus between the stored positions whilst automatically preventing overshoot when the target position is achieved.</p>
<p>To use the focus functionality of the AFX with your manual lenses, it is simply connected to a Tilta focus motor using an included cable and adapter. Users of Nucleus M motors will require an additional adapter that is now listed as an additional perk item and will ship at the same time as your AFX.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603752677/k4ts8hdfxyfi3sg9hntz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of the same manual and autofocus modes and features of the AFX are available when using the motor option irrespective of the camera and lens that you use it with.</p>
<p>For the many users of Blackmagic Pocket Cinema cameras who also like to use manual focus lenses, the AFX has a special Hybrid mode to enable lens control with a motor whilst still being able to wirelessly change functions such as ISO, White Balance and Shutter on the camera.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Introducing AFX by CDA-TEK
The AFX is a comprehensive auto and manual focus control system for Blackmagic Pocket 4K and 6K cinema cameras as well as offering motor based control of manual focus lenses on all other cameras.
For Blackmagic Pocket 4K and 6K cinema cameras using native MFT/EF electronic lenses, there is no requirement for external focus motors and the AFX also supports adapted EF lenses on the Pocket 4K with compatible adapters.

Powered by its own internal rechargeable battery, the AFX is a self contained unit which requires no cabling and communicates wirelessly over Bluetooth to your camera.
Originally conceived as an add on to our PBC controller, the AFX now also incorporates the full capabilities of the PBC so is a completely self contained system.
In addition, the AFX also incorporates an interface for Tilta Nucleus M and N motors to provide its auto and manual focus functionality to any lens on any camera.

At the heart of the AFX is a LIDAR sensor that constantly measures the distance to the nearest central object, which the AFX then processes to move the focus position of the lens to the correct calibrated position.
Using this method, the lens moves immediately and consistently to the focus position, so unlike other image based auto focus systems, not only is there no focus hunting but its performance is not impacted in low light.

Included with the AFX is a compact wireless remote which allows you to control its different operational modes and functions as well as manually control focus.
This compact controller can also be used to change an array of settings on your Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera such as aperture, ISO and white balance.

The AFX screen provides full monitoring of the current status of these parameters as well as an alternative measured distance indicator screen.

The AFX provides two auto focus modes; AFS and AFC.
In AFS mode, the lens is refocused on the nearest central object when the trigger on the controller is pressed and remains at that position until the trigger is pressed again or you manually refocus.
In AFC mode, the lens is continuously re-focused on the nearest central object enabling you to track a person walking towards the camera for example.
Using the controller you can instantly switch between AFS, AFC and manual focus modes and to provide smoother focus changes, you are also able to select four automatic transition times between focus points in the two auto modes.
The AFX also has an additional transition mode called Natural that automatically adjusts the focus transition time dependent upon the distance between the current and new focus position.
To provide you with even more focus assistance functionality, the AFX has a mode called QuadLock.
Using QuadLock, you can quickly store four focus positions using either the LIDAR sensor or manually and then switch between them instantly or with the currently set transition time applied.
An additional switched option in QuadLock allows you to manually move focus between the stored positions whilst automatically preventing overshoot when the target position is achieved.
To use the focus functionality of the AFX with your manual lenses, it is simply connected to a Tilta focus motor using an included cable and adapter. Users of Nucleus M motors will require an additional adapter that is now listed as an additional perk item and will ship at the same time as your AFX.

 
All of the same manual and autofocus modes and features of the AFX are available when using the motor option irrespective of the camera and lens that you use it with.
For the many users of Blackmagic Pocket Cinema cameras who also like to use manual focus lenses, the AFX has a special Hybrid mode to enable lens control with a motor whilst still being able to wirelessly change functions such as ISO, White Balance and Shutter on the camera.

Although the obvious standout feature of the AFX is providing single and continuous Autofocus for camera/lens combinations that do not have the facility natively, it is important to note that the nature of the sensor is to provide centre point detection only.
With this in mind, we have designed the AFX to be a complete focusing system with additional features such as manual control and the QuadLock system to supplement its autofocus capabilities and be a more rounded focus assisting tool.
MMX Multi Motor Add-On
The MMX is an optional expansion add on for the AFX focusing system and allows you to control up to three Tilta Nucleus N or Nucleus M motors.

This means that using the MMX, you can not only control the focus of your manual lens from the AFX but also, for example, its zoom and iris controls.
The MMX has two operational modes, called Single and Dual.
In Single mode, each motor is individually calibrated and they are then operated independently.
In Dual mode, two of the motors are used to create a bonded calibration that would typically be used for a dual focus anamorphic setup and effectively transforming it into a single focus system.
And of course this ganged control of dual focus anamorphic lens systems also means they can now also benefit from the the auto focus capabilities offered by the AFX.

For iris control, you are also able to calibrate one of your motors to the T stops on your lens and then use the controller on the AFX to switch between them as though it had electronic aperture control.
The MMX can control any combination of Tilta Nucleus N or M motors on its three ports and is powered by the motor on port one.

The MMX connects to the AFX wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy but can also be used with a wired connection.
When using the Tilta Nucleus N motors, you can use the included interface cable and users with Nucleus M motors will require an additional interface cable.
The MMX is available as a pre-order perk now for €105 and will be available to ship with your AFX.

 

What We Need & What You Get
The AFX is feature complete from a software and hardware perspective and are now seeking funding purely for production rather than development.
We have have two levels of perks, each with a different discount level from the retail price of the AFX.
The first of these is exclusively for existing owners of our PBC unit, so please do not choose this option if you do not own a PBC as it will be rejected.

No matter photography style, as Ansel Adams said, ""You don't take a photograph, YOU MAKE IT."" More than ever, it is now much easier to make creative photos by expanding the capabilities of your camera. Meet FLEX, a smart camera gadget for creative photography.After 3 successful Kickstarter campaigns in the last 6 years, we are back with FLEX. This powerful device helps you capture stunning time-lapse videos, HDR photos, high-speed actions, extraordinary lightning strikes, and more. You will be undoubtedly impressed by its great features and be amazed by the contribution it will make to your photography. Lightning strikes are one of the spectacular events of nature. With the help of FLEX, you can now automatically make daytime and nighttime lightning photos. Combine multiple lightning strikes in a single image in seconds to make awe-inspiring lightning photos. Holy-Grail Timelapse mode is a great feature for complex light conditions such as day-to-night and night-to-day transitions. FLEX adjusts the settings of your camera with the changing light conditions to create eye-catching timelapse videos. FLEX is one of the most powerful devices for making time-lapse videos. In addition to regular time-lapse modes, FLEX adds ""HDR Time-Lapse"", and even ""Holy Grail Time-Lapse"" for complex lighting conditions such as day-to-night transitions. Best of all, FLEX shows you a preview of your time-lapse video during the shooting progress.  Step into High-Speed photography with FLEX's smart sensors, which combine multiple high-speed photography features in a single unit. Unleash your creativity by freezing popping balloons or broken glasses as you capture images of flying objects. FLEX now gives you access to your camera's settings - right from your smartphone. Go ahead - put your camera in hard-to-reach places to get that amazing angle. Activate the shutter button without touching the camera to avoid camera shakes. Best of all - see what your camera sees with LiveView. Back up the photos from your camera to your FLEX instantly. Moreover, it is also possible to access and transfer these backed up photos wirelessly without installing any software on your computer.

Not anymore. The Volta 2.0 battery system is built after those same principles.
 
Whether you are looking to power a fully built-up Red DSMC2 rig, or you need to run-and-gun with your stripped-down mirrorless setup, our products are designed to adapt to your needs.
 

 
VOLTA 2.0 TOP HANDLE
 
Machined from aircraft grade 7075 Aluminium using high precision 5 axis milling, the Volta 2.0 top handle is designed to improve the functionality and ergonomics of your rig by combining a large capacity removable battery inside a minimalist handle.
 
 It features three outputs (2x 7.2V D-tap & 5V USB C 3A) which can be used simultaneously, offering you the freedom to set up your rig just the way you like it. It can power your camera, monitor, focus motor, wireless video transmitter, audio receiver or even your phone without the need for cumbersome splitters or adapters. We have compiled a full compatibility list which you can check out.   Since we can't agree on which is the better mounting option.  Why not... have both?The modular design allows you to choose between the cold shoe mount which is compatible with most cameras (and Tilta cages) or the Nato rail mount which makes installing and uninstalling the handle a breeze. And the best part? Both are included in the box.  For those situations where mounting points on the handle are a must-have, there are two options included. The 15 mm mount which uses a robust, one piece design and the new and improved monitor mount. Both of them can be used simultaneously.   Choose between the Military Green, Clear Silver and All Black colour schemes.  With the newly introduced Production Kit, we're offering unprecedented levels of customization with the option to laser etch your own design on the side of the handle. It can be your production company logo, your personal brand or anything that inspires you. And you also have full control over how to position it.   The Snapcharger®Powered by the increasingly more common USB-C PD protocol, the Snapcharger™ does not only provide incredibly fast charging speeds, but it can do it with your laptop adapter. People screw up.

So far, SIRUI APS-C anamorphic lenses are all in place to ignite your passion for shooting.​Designed with a unique structure, the lens squeezes images down 1.33 times horizontally to fit onto the camera sensor, which you then have to desqueeze in post. Images produced in this way would be in 2.4:1 wide-screen aspect ratio and of high resolution, way better than that of just cropping and adding black bars.



In terms of application scenario, 24mm lens is suitable for wide-angle shots, 35mm for humanistic shots, and 50mm for subject separation shots. When trying to portray characters in a subtle way or enhance emotional rendering, those lenses seem a bit insufficient in expression. In this case, getting a portrait lens will render the narrative more natural and coherent.















This lens is free from obvious perspective distortion relative to wide angle lens, hence characters are presented in a more natural way, as if seeing right through your eyes. The 75mm focal length guarantees not only a good distance between the photographer and the model, but also an easy switch between a bust portrait and a full-length portrait.



The lens is good at filling the frame with the subject and throwing the background out of focus. Also, sharp and high-resolution imaging contributes to the depiction of subtle emotions.
The 75mm focal length excels at revealing overlooked details in a chaotic scene, providing a fresh and unique perspective for film interpretation.Focal length of 75mm equals better long-range shooting capability, which renders long-distance shooting a worry for photographers no more.Spatial compression created by the lens narrows the distance between the background and the subject, amplifying the background while highlighting the subject, delivering a compact yet plump effect.This lens has got what it takes to produce a cinematic blockbuster - high-quality images without deformation, natural and saturated blue lens flares as well as elliptical bokeh.
Fast F1.8 aperture guarantees a sufficient amount of light, and the image remains sharp even with the aperture wide open. The enhanced shutter speed is favorable both for low-light shooting and snapshot taking, readily turning a casual shot into a cinematic poster.
Images produced by this lens are high in sharpness, small in chromatic aberration and curve of field, displaying distinctive Anamorphic features.Aircraft aluminum housing, CNC machining parts, German Schott Glass with multi-layer nano coating, focus and aperture rings with anti-slip teeth and filter spec of M67*0.75 all indicate that the 75mm lens intercuts seamlessly with the entire line of SIRUI Anamorphic primes in terms of appearance.

Five mounts, M4/3, Sony E, Fuji X, Nikon Z，and Canon EF-M, are designed for the 75mm lens, which is durable and lends images higher resolution.As the lightest and most affordable mirrorless Anamorphic lenses on the market today, SIRUI Anamorphic lenses are perfect companions for commercial directors, studio photographers, vloggers, cinematographers, and cinematic enthusiasts.

You are the reason to support us always keep the passion. We love filming, and enjoy it, Vmate is a new start, and Indiegogo is our trusted platform with our years of supporters, so we chose to first launch on Indiegogo.     A palm-sized gimbal camera with all your needs  Snoppa Vmate is a handheld compact high-performance 4k smart camera integrated with a micro 3-axis stabilizing system. It is light, portable, and lets you can carry it anywhere. With it, capturing great moments is easy: no need to take a bag of devices.   Micro 3-axis Stabilizing SystemSnoppa’s newly designed micro 3-axis stabilizing system can effectively eliminate shakes and jitters when filming handheld on the go, allowing for smooth and highly detailed footage. Gimbal stabilization  VS  Optical image stabilization Gimbal stabilization  VS  Electronic stabilization Gimbal stabilization  VS  Electronic stabilization & Optical image stabilization   Great PortabilityUnlike ordinary gimbals which are commonly big and heavy, Vmate only weighs 118 grams, which is as light as a lemon.  The Vmate is so small that you can easily carry it in your pocket, handbag, or even just hang it on your wrist.  Quick Initial SetupCompared with traditional gimbals, Vmate is much easier and faster to set up. It doesn’t require a phone to be mounted and doesn’t need balancing. It just starts ready for operation right away. You won’t miss the moment anymore!  High-quality Camera           Vmate supports a high-performance camera utilizing:
Image Sensor: 1/2.3 inch;
FOV: 81˚ wide lens;
Aperture: F2.0.
  Thanks to the powerful CPU with A53 cores, it can shoot:
Video up to 4k@60 fps;
8X slow-motion video (1080@240fps);
12-megapixel stills. 

  Fast And Accurate Auto FocusingVmate can quickly auto adjust the focus between objects of different distance, and always keep your filming target sharp and clear in the frame.  Multi-functional CaseThe Vmate carrying case is not only designed to protect the device. It comes with a foldable phone holder, to which you can attach a phone for a more comfortable grab.  One-hand control     Extra Bright Touchscreen DisplayVmate equips with a 1.22"" sharp touchscreen with high brightness up to 850 nits, allowing you to frame clearly even under bright sunlight. Touchscreen lets you set controls and change configuration with a finger touch right on the Vmate.   90˚ Rotating LensThe camera head-on Vmate can rotate by 90˚, which lets you switch between landscape and portrait orientation in a flick.   Wifi Connection  Vmate has a built-in WiFi module, providing the wireless interface to let your phone connect with it. Paired with Snoppa’s dedicated app, the phone can be used for a wireless preview and some advanced features like broadcaster mode.   The WiFi module allows you to wirelessly synchronize the files from Vmate to your phone anytime and anywhere.Transfer the captured media files to the phone  Superfast on File TransferVmate integrates a type-c port for charging and file transfer. Thanks to the USB 3.1 GEN 1 port feature, Vmate can export the file at a speed of 72MB/s, which is 8x as fast as an ordinary USB 2.0 port.   Built-in MicrophoneA good video always comes with good audio. Vmate has a dual-microphone system, providing two audio recording modes, either noise reduction or stereo. The Mobile application lets you switch between them, to fit any situation. External microphoneVmate also has a Bluetooth module. Aside from the built-in mic system, it is possible to use any Bluetooth microphone as an audio source while recording video. Wearing your Apple Airpods, or other TWS earbuds lets you comment your video flawlessly as it goes, making the process of audio recording much easier.  Broadcaster ModeBroadcaster mode lets you spend less time editing your footage! The selfie camera on the phone and gimbal camera can both record video simultaneously: show the scenery and your reaction to it at the same time.   Wonderful App FeaturesWith the dedicated app, people can get more gimbal controls and shooting methods  Automatically keeps the target centered in the frame Up to 8X slow motion (or 1080p@240fps) lets you stop time and watch cool action in detailThe POV mode lets gimbal smoothly follow your movements, recording first-person view footage. Timelapse, motion lapse, hyper-lapse, allows you to squeeze a long period of beautiful time into a short clip. Static timelapse  VS  Hyperlapse

<p>My Name is Helena Cochrane, and I am a 16-year-old deep space astrophotographer with a passion for inspiring young women in STEM!</p>
<p>Astrophotography is the art of capturing our universe, and it’s a challenge. From day one, I made the decision to create a YouTube channel and take my audience along with me in the hopes of passing on my passion to the younger generation. My aim was to make my channel as open as possible, showing my successes and my fails so my followers could learn from them. Needless to say, this community of people is like no other. I’ve made some lifelong friends through it!</p>
<p>Being on YouTube has given me many cool opportunities to collaborate with different astrophotography manufacturers. My dream is to make this a lifelong career, through content creation and giving back to the community what the community has given me. I have a huge passion for filmmaking, which is partly why I get so excited about making videos! Just this year, I was absolutely blown away when the camera company QHY got in touch, asking if I would like to review one of their cameras. I am currently in the process of reviewing it for my viewers, in the hopes it gives them an honest opinion, and another option when it comes to purchasing gear. Needless to say, this camera is awesome and beyond the level of anything I have ever used before. I would really like to be able to purchase it, to have as my new deep sky imaging camera.</p>
<p>This Campaign has been setup in the hopes that I can start to build up some savings to call this camera my own. However, I totally appreciate that not everyone can donate financially. If you’re reading this, the support and encouragement you have given me on my journey is more than enough and I will be forever grateful for your support.</p>
<p>I hope you are all keeping safe and well! If you would like to check out more of my work, here is a link to my YouTube channel -<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5Hd14VipcinOzhlI5aXhQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5Hd14VipcinOzhlI5aXhQ</a></p>

<li>
<strong><i>Other Wearable Cameras: </i></strong>Most of them are based on low end image processor which doesn't provide 4K or 60fps/120fps high frame rate video features. </li>
<li>
<strong><i>Mokacam Snap 4K:</i></strong> We packed 288 components into the tiny body of Snap, including a<i> Powerful Image Process</i><strong> </strong>with the latest camera technology. This is why Snap supports both 4K and smoother 1080P 60fps video filming.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Image Sensor:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<i><strong>Other wearable cameras: </strong></i>Most of the 1080P wearable/action cameras chose 3MP~8MP low end image processer to lower the cost, but the image/video quality is not good enough for you to record the precious moments. </li>
<li>
<i><strong>Mokacam Snap 4K: </strong></i>Snap has a <strong>13MP 1/3.06"" SONY Image Sensor</strong>, which is more realistic on color reproduction and provides much more details on both videos and still photos.</li>

<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>How many hours will Snap last if only used for taking pictures?</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>There are many factors and conditions to calculate this, but generally the battery life should last you for more than 1 day.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Can Snap connect to a microphone through a 3.5mm mic adapter?</strong></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Snap can charge on 100-220 volts right?</strong></strong></p>

Compare to see which one is more realistic on color reproduction Why Snap is More PowerfulImage Processor: 

Other Wearable Cameras: Most of them are based on low end image processor which doesn't provide 4K or 60fps/120fps high frame rate video features. 

Mokacam Snap 4K: We packed 288 components into the tiny body of Snap, including a Powerful Image Process with the latest camera technology. This is why Snap supports both 4K and smoother 1080P 60fps video filming.
Image Sensor:

Other wearable cameras: Most of the 1080P wearable/action cameras chose 3MP~8MP low end image processer to lower the cost, but the image/video quality is not good enough for you to record the precious moments. 

Mokacam Snap 4K: Snap has a 13MP 1/3.06"" SONY Image Sensor, which is more realistic on color reproduction and provides much more details on both videos and still photos.

<p>Unistellar’s App, currently under development, enables you to wirelessly control the eVscope (Bluetooth or Wifi). It runs on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac or Linux. You can choose between beginner and expert mode. In beginner mode, everything is done automatically: after the automatic alignment procedure completes itself, simply choose an object and the telescope will point to it, you can then save pictures, record videos, or add contextual information.</p>
<p>In expert mode everything can be set manually: choose the sky region for alignment, point manually anywhere in the sky, set the sensor sensitivity and exposure time, adjust noise reduction and gamma curve.</p>

<h1><b>Development Stage</b></h1>
<p>We have partnered with a highly-regarded manufacturer that’s highly regarded in its field and very experienced at making complex, high-quality consumer electronics. So, the final countdown has begun, and manufacture of your eVscopes is set to start in the very near future.</p>
<p>We’re now working closely with this company to take the eVscope through each step of the design-to-manufacture process. After finalizing the custom-made electronics and the mechanics, we are currently designing the first industrial prototypes. The whole process and its extensive testing will lead us to the set up of assembly lines then to mass production and an expected delivery starting in Q2 2019.</p>

<h1>Opening new Frontiers for Exploration, Entertainment, and Citizen Science</h1>
<p>Unistellar also wants to bring the wonders of astronomy back to city dwellers, most of whom have lost touch with the wonders of the night sky. Many more objects—most far, far more wondrous and beautiful than Pluto—are now well within viewing range of casual astronomers. Comets, extra-galactic supernovae, fast near-Earth asteroids, and much more —they’re out there every night, just above you in the sky, and they’re inviting you to have a look. Take them up on that invitation and your life will never be the same. </p>

   Here is how it works in practice:

A Compact and Portable Telescope

 
eVscope's Control App
Unistellar’s App, currently under development, enables you to wirelessly control the eVscope (Bluetooth or Wifi). It runs on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac or Linux. You can choose between beginner and expert mode. In beginner mode, everything is done automatically: after the automatic alignment procedure completes itself, simply choose an object and the telescope will point to it, you can then save pictures, record videos, or add contextual information.
In expert mode everything can be set manually: choose the sky region for alignment, point manually anywhere in the sky, set the sensor sensitivity and exposure time, adjust noise reduction and gamma curve.

Note: For the sake of clarity, we didn't overlay our night filter on these views of the app. Night filter dims the light of the smartphone so your eye stays sensitive to the fainter lighting of the night and nightsky objects.

Development Stage
We have partnered with a highly-regarded manufacturer that’s highly regarded in its field and very experienced at making complex, high-quality consumer electronics. So, the final countdown has begun, and manufacture of your eVscopes is set to start in the very near future.
We’re now working closely with this company to take the eVscope through each step of the design-to-manufacture process. After finalizing the custom-made electronics and the mechanics, we are currently designing the first industrial prototypes. The whole process and its extensive testing will lead us to the set up of assembly lines then to mass production and an expected delivery starting in Q2 2019.

Evolution of the eVscope
 
Completion Timeline
 

Opening new Frontiers for Exploration, Entertainment, and Citizen Science
Unistellar also wants to bring the wonders of astronomy back to city dwellers, most of whom have lost touch with the wonders of the night sky. Many more objects—most far, far more wondrous and beautiful than Pluto—are now well within viewing range of casual astronomers. Comets, extra-galactic supernovae, fast near-Earth asteroids, and much more —they’re out there every night, just above you in the sky, and they’re inviting you to have a look. Take them up on that invitation and your life will never be the same.",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

What we say is what you get. Individually calibrating the color engine of each fixture we produce ensures that you get accurate color properties at any settings true to our published data.   ConsistencyTo ensure consistency after years of use fixtures powered by the Rayzr Light Engine can be recalibrated by the user for accurate colors and color temperatures, always. Make sure you can rely on your fixtures independent of their age and that you can match various fixtures easily by calibrating them.With Source Match you can make your lighting more consistent and save time in post fixing non matching lights . The powerful Rayzr Light Engine enables you to match any light source. Enter the x/y coordinates you measured and your fixture will be an exact match bringing consistency to your lighting.  Creative FreedomWith full color tunability and a host of modes you can take full control about your lighting and concentrate freely on your creativity. With the RTX control App you don’t need to be an engineer to create complex lighting setups. Change the way you work with lights, create complex lighting setups with a simple to use interface and bring your lighting ideas to life easily. Intuitive User InterfaceAn intuitive user interface coupled with advanced control functions enables you to control each light in depth, separately or in groups of lights, with ease.*RTX1 router needer for App control or Wifi remote. The RTX tec SystemThe hardware and software of the RTXtec control system is designed to support large lighting setups reliably and with ease. RiggingWith a variety of mounting points and specialized accessories for certain setups you can mount the Peragos Tube in any way you can imagine.1/4"" Female Suspension RingGround Light Stand16 mm Pin V-Type Quick ReleaseWith a simple to use V-Type Quick Release you can quickly attach and detach the controller unit and smart Li-Ion battery pack to the backside of the tube. A female QR point in the center of the tube with fitting grip accessories like a Spigot makes it easy to rig the tubes. Additional ¼ inch threadings at strategic locations give even more rigging options. 
Extendable Controller & Battery Controller and Smart Li-Ion battery pack for the Peragos Tube are implemented in a modular way to give maximum freedom how to set them up. The controller is compatible to both the Peragos 60C and 120C and you can power the tubes by AC directly through the controller. 
Smart Li-Ion Battery and Charging With the exchangeable Smart Li-Ion battery you can power the Peragos Tube for up to 20 hours. The 4 pcs charger allows you to recharge multiple units at once and even from within their case. When the AC adapter is connected to the controller and the Smart Li-Ion battery pack is attached it automatically charges during operation, so that you are always ready to use it on battery without any wires.       Once you’ve backed this project, you can add additional accessories by simply increasing your pledge by the corresponding € amount. At the end of the campaign we will send you a survey to let us know which items you want.          Risks & ChallengesWith years of experience as a manufacturer of LED lights released under our various brands we know the challenges of a new product release very well. The expected product performance and quality has been tested through several prototype cycles. Any unforeseen problems we will solve with open communication and ensure our backers are happy with the products they supported. ShippingAll shipping fees will be collected separately once the campaign is over based on real shipping costs.

<h3>KOBRA Flash Modifier!</h3>
<p>If you backed us on our earlier campaign, we want to thank you and say welcome back! If this is new to you, we are proud to introduce the KOBRA.</p>
<p>The KOBRA was made to give photographers an effective flash modifier solution that is lightweight, flexible and with an attractive design.</p>
<p>As a professional photographer, I have used all the “on camera flash” modifiers that are available and have been unsatisfied with the results. I decided to stop complaining and make my own.</p>

<p>Prototype - Patent Pending</p>
<p>The <strong>KOBRA Flash Modifier</strong> is molded from a high-grade, flexible, light diffusing clear silicone that is not affected by high or low temperatures. This allows the <strong>KOBRA Flash Modifier</strong> to bounce back to its originally molded shape after being folded from storing in your camera bag.  </p>
<p>Making sure the <strong>KOBRA</strong> was aesthetically pleasing front &amp; back was paramount in the early design process.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529456290/q6rbomuykh3p12o23x9l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <strong>KOBRA Flash Modifier</strong> gets its backbone from the patent-pending built-in reflector. The reflector bounces the light forward through the clear silicone, acting as a second layer of diffusion, giving the photographer the ability to ""paint with the light, not spray."" </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The problem with most modifiers, light is sprayed everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>First Time Using Flash in Event Photography  </strong></p>
<p>Photographer Cole Ferguson was shooting an event and asked if he could borrow the <strong>KOBRA Flash Modifier </strong>prototype. The resulting images are remarkable from a photographer who is a self-proclaimed newbie to event photography. The KOBRA allowed him to be in control of capturing moments that otherwise would have been lost to low light conditions. This is why we made KOBRA.</p>

</div></div>","KOBRA Flash Modifier!
If you backed us on our earlier campaign, we want to thank you and say welcome back! If this is new to you, we are proud to introduce the KOBRA.
The KOBRA was made to give photographers an effective flash modifier solution that is lightweight, flexible and with an attractive design.
As a professional photographer, I have used all the “on camera flash” modifiers that are available and have been unsatisfied with the results. I decided to stop complaining and make my own.








Prototype - Patent Pending
The KOBRA Flash Modifier is molded from a high-grade, flexible, light diffusing clear silicone that is not affected by high or low temperatures. This allows the KOBRA Flash Modifier to bounce back to its originally molded shape after being folded from storing in your camera bag.  
Making sure the KOBRA was aesthetically pleasing front & back was paramount in the early design process.

The KOBRA Flash Modifier gets its backbone from the patent-pending built-in reflector. The reflector bounces the light forward through the clear silicone, acting as a second layer of diffusion, giving the photographer the ability to ""paint with the light, not spray."" 

KOBRA's light is bounced forward and not wasted.

The problem with most modifiers, light is sprayed everywhere.
 
The KOBRA Modifier & Band weighs in at a mere 4.3oz! 

The KOBRA is super light on your flash.

KOBRA gets its backbone from the built-in reflector, which is white inside with a black exterior.


First Time Using Flash in Event Photography  
Photographer Cole Ferguson was shooting an event and asked if he could borrow the KOBRA Flash Modifier prototype. The resulting images are remarkable from a photographer who is a self-proclaimed newbie to event photography. The KOBRA allowed him to be in control of capturing moments that otherwise would have been lost to low light conditions. This is why we made KOBRA.

With the KOBRA - Nice light, soft hair & skin tones.

Without the KOBRA - Direct flash is a good light for a police mug shot!
In most cases, there are no white walls or ceilings to bounce off of. That is where the KOBRA Flash Modifier is a game-changer. Now, you are walking around with your own wall. 
The KOBRA flash modifier generates softer fabric & skin tones.



""One step closer"" you get soft shadows with your subject.
Even with the advanced technology of today's cameras, low light conditions subject your images to movement or noise. To avoid this scenario, you need to bring light to the party. You need the KOBRA Flash Modifier. 


The KOBRA Band is molded from a high-grade, flexible, black silicone that is not affected by high or low temperatures. The KOBRA Band fits most flash heads. It's simple and self-contained with no need for hook-and-loop or magnet attachments. 

KOBRA Band
Incorporated into the design of the KOBRA Band are vent holes to allow air to circulate over the flash head and assist with preventing the potential for overheating.

Air Vents help with air flow.
Will fit almost all flash heads.

The KOBRA Band not only holds the KOBRA Flash Modifier but also multitasks by securing our KOBRA Color Gel System.

The KOBRA flash modifier is light & flexible and easy to pack.




Flash Modifier Comparison - Size, weight & coverage matters.


 



One of the first questions we are asked when meeting professional photographers who have seen the working prototype is, ""Where can I get one?” 







The KOBRA Flash Modifier is used off camera on a light-stand, which offers greater coverage than direct flash.

Even if you tilt your softbox at a deep angle or (for some reason) shoot inside a wind tunnel, the MagBox and the MagRing are staying put.</p><p><strong>EASY SETUP &amp; TEAR DOWN</strong></p><p>The MagBox is one solid piece. Pop it open with an easy, satisfying click. With magnets in the base, you can throw it onto your MagRing in a second. When you’re ready to remove the MagBox from the MagRing, simply press the Magnetic Field Disrupter (A.K.A. - the orange tab on top of the MagRing). Then fold up the MagBox; it collapses in one neat, portable piece and can be stored safely in the MagBox Case.</p><p><strong>2 INNOVATIVE DIFFUSERS</strong></p><p>We created a whole new way to modify your light, and it’s called the FocusDiffuser. The FocusDiffuser acts like grid and a lens combined, allowing you to control light spill and increase the effective light output. Just want soft light? Use our Fabric Diffuser. Embedded magnets in both diffusers make attaching them to your MagBox fast and easy.</p><p><strong>HASSLE-FREE, INTEGRATED GELS</strong></p><p>Forget taping flimsy gel sheets to the outside of your softbox. Our rigid gels snap right into a built-in gel holder. You don’t even have to remove your diffuser to change gels!  Use the MagBox's handy side zipper to access gels.</p><p><strong>SPEEDLITE AND STROBE COMPATIBLE</strong></p><p>The MagBox is the most versatile softbox ever, making it one super smart investment. Use the MagBox with 1 or 2 speedlights—any flash that has our patented MagGrip installed will work. Or use one of our adapters to mount your Profoto, Bowens, Elinchrom or Paul C. Buff strobe.</p><p><strong>OBSTRUCTION-FREE DESIGN</strong></p><p>The calculated design of the MagBox 24 Octa distributes light evenly and without a hotspot on a single or multiple speedlites. Hence, the reason why this softbox is devoid of an internal baffle. It’s not necessary! The MagBox provides the cleanest light quality and highest effective output.</p><p><strong>AWESOME</strong></p><p>The MagBox, MagRing and MagShoe help you work smarter, better and faster so you can focus on doing your thing: creating awesome images and impressing your clients. So go ahead and try new techniques—even under busy shooting conditions. Changing your lighting on the fly has never been simpler.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://magmod.s3.amazonaws.com/ks/gifs/mbgel.gif"" src=""""/></p><h2>MADE WITH THE MAGBOX</h2><p>We gave the MagBox to 5 amazing wedding photographers, and they took it for a test drive. Here’s what they created with the MagBox on their first time out the gate.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4eGiPNH4Wg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534455537/pcvmjo4gklpp6w5n2lsc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534455638/iw0qbr8g82p7cw8zyal7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534455706/im8orjrfk1vl1aixgzpb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534456020/zcgwiflluzq1t31qcpsc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://magmod.s3.amazonaws.com/ks/gifs/Focus_Diffuser_Fabric_Animation.gif"" src=""""/> </p><p>The <strong>FocusDiffuser</strong> controls light like a grid, but also focuses light like a lens—all while keeping it super soft.</p><p>Inside the FocusDiffuser, micro-structures alter the angle of light in 40 or 20-degree beam angles, softly redirecting light forward and causing less spill.</p><p>The FocusDiffuser actually increases the effective light output of your light—just like a fresnel lens! Our popular MagBeam (launched 2 years ago here on Kickstarter), introduced spotlight-like control and light intensity in a small modifier, and now the FocusDiffuser gives you the same increase in effective light output potential in a larger modifier.</p><p><strong>BETTER CONTROL OF SOFT LIGHT</strong></p><p>What MagMod’s MagGrid is to bare speedlights, the FocusDiffuser is to softboxes. Create beautiful soft light and place it exactly where you want it. The FocusDiffuser limits spill to give you the control you need to work more efficiently and save time in post.</p><p><strong>EASIER THAN A FABRIC GRID</strong></p><p>With an old-style softbox, your options for controlling light were limited to a fragile fabric grid that attached with annoying, noisy velcro. Lamesauce! The FocusDiffuser attaches to the MagBox in one second—quickly, quietly and easily—because magnets. And when you’re done with it, you can roll it up neatly and store it safely inside our MagBox Case.</p><p><strong>UP TO 700% MORE LIGHT</strong></p><p>When compared to traditional softboxes, the MagBox with FocusDiffuser is up to 2.8 stops brighter. It gives you the softness you’d expect with the control and precision of a grid, all while increasing the total light on your subject by up to 700% when compared to other competing softboxes.</p><h2>YA CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT A FOCUSDIFFUSER.</h2><p>To create the image below, Trevor Dayley used the MagBox 24 + FocusDiffuser and two AD200 speedlights.</p><p>As you can see in the behind-the-scenes shot, the model is standing in full, crazy bright Arizona summer midday sunlight. You can see her shadow cast on the wall behind her. The shadows of the tree branches, which end up in the final image, were also all created by the high angle of the sun.</p><p>Trevor used the FocusDiffuser and two AD200s on high power to cancel out the sun and put soft light on the model. It would have been impossible to make this image with portable flashes without the FocusDiffuser. Trevor would have needed a studio strobe to overpower the sun.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534456446/nl1iw6tzkpfgxrtlmp0e.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The FocusDiffuser is no gimmick.

Since the MagGrip works with pretty much any flash, you can use pretty much any speedlights you own inside your MagBox.</p><p><strong>ON-CAMERA TO OFF IN 1 SECOND</strong></p><p>Thanks to the freakishly strong neodymium magnets inside the MagGrip, speedlights attach securely to the MagRing—in literally 1 second. No special tools or locks required. The MagRing makes it easy to switch a speedlight from being on-camera to off-camera in a jiff.</p><p><strong>STRONG &amp; SECURE LOCKS</strong></p><p>The MagRing is rock-solid. With your flashes magnetically mounted in the ring, close the beefy security doors to lock ‘em in place. You spent a lot of money on your flash; protect your investment from kissing the pavement or getting lost in the ocean by locking it up securely in the MagRing.</p><p><strong>TIME-SAVING CONVENIENCE</strong></p><p>The MagRing is so convenient that you’re free to leave your mounted flash or flashes in it even when you don’t need your softbox. No need to waste time ripping apart your whole set up just cause you wanna change locations and modifiers.

Even if you tilt your softbox at a deep angle or (for some reason) shoot inside a wind tunnel, the MagBox and the MagRing are staying put.EASY SETUP & TEAR DOWNThe MagBox is one solid piece. Pop it open with an easy, satisfying click. With magnets in the base, you can throw it onto your MagRing in a second. When you’re ready to remove the MagBox from the MagRing, simply press the Magnetic Field Disrupter (A.K.A. - the orange tab on top of the MagRing). Then fold up the MagBox; it collapses in one neat, portable piece and can be stored safely in the MagBox Case.2 INNOVATIVE DIFFUSERSWe created a whole new way to modify your light, and it’s called the FocusDiffuser. The FocusDiffuser acts like grid and a lens combined, allowing you to control light spill and increase the effective light output. Just want soft light? Use our Fabric Diffuser. Embedded magnets in both diffusers make attaching them to your MagBox fast and easy.HASSLE-FREE, INTEGRATED GELSForget taping flimsy gel sheets to the outside of your softbox. Our rigid gels snap right into a built-in gel holder. You don’t even have to remove your diffuser to change gels!  Use the MagBox's handy side zipper to access gels.SPEEDLITE AND STROBE COMPATIBLEThe MagBox is the most versatile softbox ever, making it one super smart investment. Use the MagBox with 1 or 2 speedlights—any flash that has our patented MagGrip installed will work. Or use one of our adapters to mount your Profoto, Bowens, Elinchrom or Paul C. Buff strobe.OBSTRUCTION-FREE DESIGNThe calculated design of the MagBox 24 Octa distributes light evenly and without a hotspot on a single or multiple speedlites. Hence, the reason why this softbox is devoid of an internal baffle. It’s not necessary! The MagBox provides the cleanest light quality and highest effective output.AWESOMEThe MagBox, MagRing and MagShoe help you work smarter, better and faster so you can focus on doing your thing: creating awesome images and impressing your clients. So go ahead and try new techniques—even under busy shooting conditions. Changing your lighting on the fly has never been simpler.MADE WITH THE MAGBOXWe gave the MagBox to 5 amazing wedding photographers, and they took it for a test drive. Here’s what they created with the MagBox on their first time out the gate.  The FocusDiffuser controls light like a grid, but also focuses light like a lens—all while keeping it super soft.Inside the FocusDiffuser, micro-structures alter the angle of light in 40 or 20-degree beam angles, softly redirecting light forward and causing less spill.The FocusDiffuser actually increases the effective light output of your light—just like a fresnel lens! Our popular MagBeam (launched 2 years ago here on Kickstarter), introduced spotlight-like control and light intensity in a small modifier, and now the FocusDiffuser gives you the same increase in effective light output potential in a larger modifier.BETTER CONTROL OF SOFT LIGHTWhat MagMod’s MagGrid is to bare speedlights, the FocusDiffuser is to softboxes. Create beautiful soft light and place it exactly where you want it. The FocusDiffuser limits spill to give you the control you need to work more efficiently and save time in post.EASIER THAN A FABRIC GRIDWith an old-style softbox, your options for controlling light were limited to a fragile fabric grid that attached with annoying, noisy velcro. Lamesauce! The FocusDiffuser attaches to the MagBox in one second—quickly, quietly and easily—because magnets. And when you’re done with it, you can roll it up neatly and store it safely inside our MagBox Case.UP TO 700% MORE LIGHTWhen compared to traditional softboxes, the MagBox with FocusDiffuser is up to 2.8 stops brighter. It gives you the softness you’d expect with the control and precision of a grid, all while increasing the total light on your subject by up to 700% when compared to other competing softboxes.YA CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT A FOCUSDIFFUSER.To create the image below, Trevor Dayley used the MagBox 24 + FocusDiffuser and two AD200 speedlights.As you can see in the behind-the-scenes shot, the model is standing in full, crazy bright Arizona summer midday sunlight. You can see her shadow cast on the wall behind her. The shadows of the tree branches, which end up in the final image, were also all created by the high angle of the sun.Trevor used the FocusDiffuser and two AD200s on high power to cancel out the sun and put soft light on the model. It would have been impossible to make this image with portable flashes without the FocusDiffuser. Trevor would have needed a studio strobe to overpower the sun.The FocusDiffuser is no gimmick. Micro-structures focus light with beautiful softness, giving you a higher effective output to help you shoot in challenging situations with just speedlites!UNIVERSALJust pop any flash that has a MagGrip, our patented universal flash mount, into the MagRing. Since the MagGrip works with pretty much any flash, you can use pretty much any speedlights you own inside your MagBox.ON-CAMERA TO OFF IN 1 SECONDThanks to the freakishly strong neodymium magnets inside the MagGrip, speedlights attach securely to the MagRing—in literally 1 second. No special tools or locks required. The MagRing makes it easy to switch a speedlight from being on-camera to off-camera in a jiff.STRONG & SECURE LOCKSThe MagRing is rock-solid. With your flashes magnetically mounted in the ring, close the beefy security doors to lock ‘em in place. You spent a lot of money on your flash; protect your investment from kissing the pavement or getting lost in the ocean by locking it up securely in the MagRing.TIME-SAVING CONVENIENCEThe MagRing is so convenient that you’re free to leave your mounted flash or flashes in it even when you don’t need your softbox. No need to waste time ripping apart your whole set up just cause you wanna change locations and modifiers. Score!SECOND SHOOTER SOLUTIONYour assistant’s flash can be in the same position as yours—no need for a second light stand junking up your limited workspace and slowing you down.ONE BIG, HAPPY SYSTEMWe made the MagRing compatible with your existing MagMod modifiers. Throw on a MagGrid, MagGel or MagSphere without having to remove your flashes from the MagRing. Woo hoo!FINALLY! A DUAL MOUNT THAT DOESN’T SUCK. The MagRing makes it silly easy for you to mount two flashes at once.. . . which is pretty dope for, say, overpowering the sun or doubling your flash recycle times.With two flashes in the MagRing, you’ve got double the power of a single flash—almost the same amount as a studio strobe—without actually having to lug one around.FAST & EASYJust slide in your flash and turn the lock 90 degrees. It’s ready to go. The MagShoe’s sturdy lock renders that crummy, obnoxious twisty lock on your flash totally unnecessary. You’ll never have to waste time with that thing ever again.ONE-HANDED OPERATIONAdjust the angle of your light with one hand (!!!). Just press the handy orange button to make quick, precise adjustments.SECUREIn one swift motion, the MagShoe’s got your flash locked down tighter than Fort Knox. Your flash won’t come loose, and it’s not gonna wobble—even if you bump your stand.UNIVERSALThe MagShoe works with any flash.

We want a camera we can count on for quality recordings without worrying about it breaking or leaking.Tough. The underwater world is a tough place meant for tough people and tough products. Engineered by divers for divers. Inspired by our own dive gear we know that any product for diving has to be tough, easy to use, and able to go deep.So we've made the Paralenz Dive Camera in anodized aluminum and polycarbonate, with an easy-to-use two-button design, and with the ability to record at a depth of 200 m/656 ft.   Smart cam. To further enhance your dive experience the Paralenz Dive Camera has a pressure sensor for logging your dive in terms of depth and temperature, and for automatically adjusting the white balance according to your depth.  Worry-free recording. Paralenz Dive Camera is fully committed to make it as easy as possible to capture and share your dive. When diving you should not need to fumble with buttons or tweak irrelevant settings.
 
 



 

Is it only for diving? No, the Paralenz Dive Camera is perfectly capable of recording above water. Features designed for the extremes of diving also make recording easier above water.


 



 
 


Share the full experience. Equipped with a temperature and pressure sensor the Paralenz Dive Camera can log your dive and display your data together with your videos. At what depth did you see that manta ray? Now you know.

Navigating through your dive data Each dive has a specific dive log in the Paralenz App  Forget filters. With Paralenz you have no need for color filters. The Paralenz knows exactly how deep you are and adjusts your videos accordingly.  Colors underwater. As a diver you know that the deeper you go the more colors you loose. The first colors disappearing are red, orange and yellow. That's why most underwater footage captured below 10 m/33 ft. turns green. Auto white balance. The Paralenz Dive Camera is the first action camera in the world that automatically adjusts the white balance to match the depth you are at.   Snap Recording. Hold down the Activation Switch for 3 seconds and create a Snap Recording (short video clips) for quick and easy sharing. Adjust and share. When you return to the surface you can easily view your Snap Recordings on the Paralenz App. The Snap Recordings are automatically created.

So it's time to say THANKS!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First of all I'd like to thanks Stephan Wiesner. I'm still overwhelmed by his kindness and constant support in the development process of the CAMSLINGER Outdoor. This product wouldn't exist in this way without his help. Stephan is not just one super nice and reliable guy, he is also an amazing photographer, author and vlogger.Please vistit his webiste: http://www.stephanwiesner.de/blog/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/sportportraitsYouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/fotografietutorial/My next thanks goes to Andrea, Patrick and Steve from www.43rumors.com, www.sonyalpharumors.com, www.canonwatch.com and www.fujirumors.com as well as their readers. They presented this project in an early stage to their community and we got about 60(!) ideas and suggestions for the CAMSLINGER Outdoor. Many of them flowed in the final product and the bag wouldn't be so great without your support! Many thanks guys!!! :-)Bernhard and Mamba who are in charge of our EU and US logistics were always a huge support and will be when the CAMSLINGER Outdoor is about to ship. Many thanks :-)Thanks to Horst for the general support and assistance!!!Thanks to awesome PROBIS, Hamburg for the photos of cams in the CAMSLINGER Outdoor we made in their studio!!   Thanks to the amazing team of Foto+Digital Gressung, Saarbrücken, for their ideas and support!!!Thanks to Hanna and Sammi from the design and manufacturing team for their constant and constructive support.Last but not least a HUGE thanks goes to my wonderful wife Friederike and sweet little daughter Elfriede and cute baby Alwin for being so patient and supporting a super crazy photo bag guy :-)And many thanks to all you guys that are not mentioned here. All of you wonderful peeps out there are part of this project and without you we won't be where we are. FAQsWhen do you ship the CAMSLINGER Outdoor?Shipping starts by the end of April or beginning of May 2017 and we hope to get all CAMSLINGERs to backers in May 2017.Do I have to pay customs or VAT or shipping?We are shipping from warehouses/distributors in the US and Germany. So in these countries (and the EU) you dont have to pay customs. In other countries it might be, that you have to pay customs depending on the particular customs regulations in your country.VAT is basically included in every shipping respectively is not applicable inmany destinations. Shipping will be added when checking out. Depending on your country, it will be between 4,90 $US and 19,90 $US.What kind of company is COSYSPEED and what will you do with the money raised in this campaign?COSYSPEED GmbH is a German company (Ltd.) based near Frankfurt/Germany. The money from this campaign will be used for the manufacturing of the CAMSLINGER Outdoor bags.What will happen to my money if you do not reach the goal of 12.000 $USWe are using the flexible option wich allows to collect the backed money even if the targeted 12.000 $US will not be reached. However we would start the manufacturing process if we reach 9.000 $US and will ship as planned in May. If we do not reach 9.000 $US, we will refund the collected money to the backers.DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN YOU'D LIKE TO BE ANSWERED?

partners - stole two hours of breathing space between meetings in New York to travel to the Ground Zero memorial site. Guy is an avid photographer but he left his DSLR in the office, so all he had on him to document the exciting site was his iPhone. The images he was able to shoot frustrated him to the point that he decided that the next miggo project will be an advanced grip-control for iPhone photographers.</p><p><b>Fast-forward 6 months:</b> the miggo team prepare first sketches and begin to formulate designs. Very quickly we realized we were looking for a grip that will provide external control of the advanced and powerful iPhone camera. The process included searching for a suitable design concept of the Pictar body - one that resembled a camera without being too cumbersome.</p><p>At the same time we carried out a proper characterization of camera features which we would like to control externally: exposure, zoom, electronic shutter release, and more. Design took shape quite quickly - we knew from the start that it would look and feel like a classic camera. We examined a large number of sketches till we finally focused on the current direction. As you can see in the pictures, the process eventually led to the final result that we really love.</p><div data-id=""5669985""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Searching for the perfect shape"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1463421819/tddzry4dsohvc6fuxuqu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Searching for the perfect shape</figcaption></figure></div><p>The next stage was the most difficult - how to make the external buttons operate the iPhone camera without a physical connection?

The idea is that each external control emits a dual frequency when operated, that isn't detected by the human ear. Frequency duplication distinguishes between the frequencies produced by Pictar and similar frequencies that exist in the environment, thus avoiding false commands.</p><p>The specialized operating system we developed receives the frequencies and translates them into an order that results in an action.

Pictar’s shutter button offers a ""half press"" mode to lock focus and exposure for easy tracking of a moving object or to create a desired composition, as well as full-press for immediate shutter release. The button is located right under the index finger to enable precise and intuitive shooting, with one hand.Tip: if you're shooting in a cold environment, or taking pictures of extreme sports, you'll be happy to learn that with Pictar's shutter button you can now take pictures on an iPhone with your gloves! Half-press to lock focus and exposure. Press to shoot - even with gloves. Zoom with only one hand.Located right below the shutter release button, the rotating zoom ring does away with the need to touch the screen to pinch-and-zoom, and makes it easy for the user to zoom in and out with just one hand. The zoom ring can also be re-programmed by user to suit specific needs, such as the flash, white-balance, etc. if that's the case, zoom in or out will be done by ""pinching"" the iPhone's screen, like before. Let the fun begin!Clicking the zoom ring will switch between the iPhone's front and back camera for easy ""selfie"" shots. Like the rotation of the zoom ring, the button can also be re-programmed by user to suit specific needs and control other settings.Tip: Changed to ""selfie"" mode? Shooting one-handed? You can use the zoom ring for perfect composition, and shoot pictures you'll love to share.   Control light like never before!Strategically located in the right corner is the exposure compensation wheel, which lets the user quickly and easily control brightness level even before shooting. And just like with an advanced camera, the exposure compensation wheel changes the exposure in steps of 1/3 aperture, and the clear display appears at the bottom of the iPhone screen.Tip: In manual mode, the exposure compensation wheel changes its designation and allows control of ISO values. Fully customizable, the smart wheel allows users to control a variety of functions.Beginners will love the ease of control - in default mode the smart wheel controls 7 pre-set modes, which enable users to easily adjust the iPhone to any situation while focusing on actually taking the shot. Pre-set modes are:
Auto mode
Portrait mode
Landscape mode
Sport mode
Snow mode
Selfie mode
Video mode
Advanced photographers will feel right at home: the smart wheel lets you choose between 3 advanced modes:
Shutter priority
ISO priority
Manual (iPhone manual = Shutter + ISO adjustments).
The Virtual Wheel is another great feature that allows the user to control different modes such as Flash modes, Shutter speed, ISO and more - simply by using his thumb. Switching between modes is done by using the Smart Wheel.Feel like you're holding a real cameraThe iPhone is an amazing design icon, and we as designers are full of admiration for the people who brought it to the world - but let's face it: as a camera, it's nowhere near the comfort, safe feel and familiar grip of a traditional camera. So the second task we undertook - after developing advanced controls - was to design an ergonomic grip that would sit comfortably in one hand and let you take one-handed shots while holding it out the window of a speeding jeep. And we believe we did it! Pictar's grip is coated with anti-slip material and gives you something solid to grasp on one hand, while being compact enough to provide what we love about smartphones - accessibility and ease of storage. Pictar lets you take one-handed shots, anywhere, without falling out of your grasp. It provides sharp images thanks to the steady grip. We think it also looks great, with its trendy retro design inspired by classic cameras we love. Your iPhone will love it.Saves time looking for your iPhone so you'll never miss a shot or have your precious phone fall. It's rare to see a camera that isn't connected to a strap. So when we developed Pictar, we knew we wanted to design not one but two straps: a wrist strap to secure it against falling, and a neck strap for carrying. The classic Pictar kit offers a standard adjustable wrist strap with a fast connection clasp. The Pictar-Plus kit includes a neck strap too - which also connects to the same fast connection clasp.Tip: You can easily change between them or disconnect them both.The padded case will keep your PICTAR safe when not in use.Easily connect any tripod, for sharper than ever imagesThe mobile-camera revolution enables anyone to go out into the wild - jungle or city - armed with just an iPhone. There they discover that they sometimes lack a trusty buddy - a tripod. There are many ways to improvise, but you won't always find a convenient tree or flat rock to stabilize the iPhone when you really could use a tripod.That's why it was important to us to incorporate a standard 1/4"" thread in Pictar, just like real cameras have.Stable and reliable cold-shoe connector - for many camera accessory - not just iPhone oriented.The market offers an endless choice of LED-based lighting devices which add a fascinating dimension of light to the creative process. The problem is that many of them - especially the professional ones - are designed to be connected to real cameras with a standard upper connection. So Pictar offers a reliable and stable cold-shoe connection to hook up anything you want - via Pictar - to your iPhone.NOTE:
PICTAR's App does not support hand-held flash units.
The cold shoe mount can support lighting units weighs up to 300 gr. / 0,66 pounds.
Due to the fact that while it attached to PICTAR, the iPhone's connecting jack is concealed - any device that is using the connecting jack must be disconnected before actual attachment to PICTAR.
Pictar's semi-open body allows connecting most ""clip-on"" lenses. We've tested it with olloclip lens, and it works great. Mode shown: SPORTA powerful, dedicated app featuring patented high-frequency dual tone sound control.Pictar is designed to communicate with iPhone via a dedicated camera app which unlocks key features inaccessible on the native app to iPhone users. Each of the physical controls found on Pictar drive a specific function or setting and does so using high-frequency dual tone sounds. Each physical control is assigned a specific tone, and with each turn of a dial, press of a button or turn of a wheel, Pictar emits a sound that – when detected by the app – generates a corresponding action. The high-frequency dual tone (18,500 – 20,000 khz) is inaudible to the human ear and significantly increases battery life when compared to Bluetooth connectivity. High-frequency dual tone technology saves energy compared to ""Bluetooth"" systems.Using a standard CR ½ AA battery, we estimates 4-6 months of use before the need to replace the power source is required.We are offering two almost identical models who share the same features. PICTAR fits iPhone models 4 to 6S while PICTAR PLUS fits iPhone 6 PLUS and iPhone  6S PLUS.
 Perhaps one of the biggest challenges in the development process was how to let as many iPhone users benefit from Pictar, without making it too expensive by adding various adapters. The solution consists of two elements:
1: Wireless connection between Pictar and the iPhone using high-frequency sound waves (see separate chapter);2: A modular mechanical connection to connect different model iPhones of different sizes. The result - Pictar fits most existing iPhone models, and is ready for future models. If any backer plans to upgrade one day to a new model iPhone - chances are that it will fit.Tip: If you have numerous iPhones in the family, you can share Pictar without a problem by installing Pictar-Up (free) on all devices.Can I use my iPhone cover with Pictar?Pictar’s semi-open body design doesn't allow to connect a case while attaching the iPhone. The only exception is the iPhone 6 / 6s that can be fitted with a silicon case - similar to Apple’s original “Silicon Case”.And what about Pictar for Android?The decision to develop Pictar for iPhone only was not easy, and it required a lot of thought and long discussions into the night. In the end we have our reasons:1. Development of app and operating system: Thanks to Apple's unified OS it was easier for us to develop software for iPhone than Android, so we decided to focus the project to avoid wasting resources and valuable time. 2. The physical size - the iPhone comes in a limited number of models. Android phones come in so many different shapes, sizes and thicknesses, it was easier for our designers to develop a body that fits most iPhone models then to tackle countless Android models.3. Focus! The Pictar project was extremely challenging - even for companies much bigger than miggo. So it was important for us to focus only on iPhones so we could come up with a production-ready prototype as quickly as possible - and make it as good as can be. Diversification on many platforms would have diverted us from our goal.                                                                                                                           From dream to realityEighteen months ago, Guy - one of the miggo partners - stole two hours of breathing space between meetings in New York to travel to the Ground Zero memorial site. Guy is an avid photographer but he left his DSLR in the office, so all he had on him to document the exciting site was his iPhone. The images he was able to shoot frustrated him to the point that he decided that the next miggo project will be an advanced grip-control for iPhone photographers.Fast-forward 6 months: the miggo team prepare first sketches and begin to formulate designs. Very quickly we realized we were looking for a grip that will provide external control of the advanced and powerful iPhone camera. The process included searching for a suitable design concept of the Pictar body - one that resembled a camera without being too cumbersome.At the same time we carried out a proper characterization of camera features which we would like to control externally: exposure, zoom, electronic shutter release, and more. Design took shape quite quickly - we knew from the start that it would look and feel like a classic camera. We examined a large number of sketches till we finally focused on the current direction. As you can see in the pictures, the process eventually led to the final result that we really love.Searching for the perfect shapeThe next stage was the most difficult - how to make the external buttons operate the iPhone camera without a physical connection? The easiest solution - Bluetooth - was thrown out due to its tendency to ""hog"" power like there's no tomorrow, from both the iPhone itself and the grip.Advanced 3D-printing modelsAlona and DanA surprising solution came from an engineer who worked with us - using high-frequency sound waves of 18500-20000 kHz. The idea is that each external control emits a dual frequency when operated, that isn't detected by the human ear. Frequency duplication distinguishes between the frequencies produced by Pictar and similar frequencies that exist in the environment, thus avoiding false commands.The specialized operating system we developed receives the frequencies and translates them into an order that results in an action. The great advantage of the system is its zero power consumption. A standard CR ½ AA battery in Pictar can last for up to 6 months, with reasonable use.The picture above shows ""Albert"" - the experimental motherboard specially designed to simulate what Pictar knows how to do today. Clicking on each of the five buttons activating a high frequency which controlled the camera.While developing the voice system, we designed a dedicated app in collaboration with one of the best companies in the country. The app - free of course - offers even more control in terms of what the iPhone camera allows.We also added straps and a padded pouch to keep everything nice and safe, and we were ready to go. So this is it - we are ready to manufacture and hope for the best. Looking back - this past year was exciting, challenging and especially intense for the development team, but the result is worth it all.You may ask who we are and why are we here for the 3rd time?! Thanks for asking!Frankly, we believe in Kickstarter.We believe the crowd funding is the best way for a small and ambitious company like us to quickly and efficiently reach the people for whom we work so hard to develop breakthrough products.We like to listen.Kickstarter is a wonderful place to hear exactly what people think about your product - long before it reaches the market. Just think about it - this is the best, largest and most professional focus group in the world! Your knowledge is invaluable and what's really cool is that people are happy to share their knowledge and experience - to help developers like us bring to market products that might not have been developed using the traditional way.These are just some of the reasons we're here for the third time. This, and the adrenaline rush the campaign gives us, after so much hard work developing a product that we totally believe in.We were here 2 years ago with our strap&wrap - the world's first camera strap that morphs into a compact protective carrier. The campaign raised 400% above target and our young company received a huge infusion of energy to continue developing innovative products.A year ago we were back again with agua - an ipx3 storm-proof quick-draw camera holster - this time we raised 800% of what we asked for, with only 2000 amazing backers. It gave us a lot of confidence and resources to continue.In the 3 years that miggo has been around, we have developed over 10 new products with Kickstarter, and these products have been successfully sent to all backers and are also sold in over 30 countries around the world - in four different continents.Dear Kickstarter backers,We've come back to ask for your support again - help us bring Pictar to production and lend us a hand in changing the world of photography.Please join us by supporting Pictar or sharing this page with your friends and family. Any help will be appreciated for ever!Thank YOU!Team miggo",93.0,0,"3 Campaigns

No need to choose, you have both.The first low-cost digital back for your 35mm camera. For those who always wanted to have a ""hybrid"" camera working with photographic films or in digital mode.  Hi! I'm Samuel Mello Medeiros, and after 5 years and dozens of prototypes later, I'm Back® launches its final version, with a leaner design, an elegant bayonet docking system and with dedicated back covers for each of the most important brands ; Ready to order:Nikon F, Nikon F2, Nikon F3, Nikon FA, Nikon EM, Nikon FG, Nikkormat EL,  Nikon FM, Nikon FE, Nikon S2, Canon F1, Canon A1, Canon AE1, Canon FT, Pentax ME super, Pentax spotomatic, Pentax K1000, Praktica b200, Praktica MTL, Contax II, Contax RTS, Contax G2, Olympus OM1, Olympus OM2, Olympus OM4, Olympus OM10, Minolta Dinaxx 7000, Minolta XD series, Yashica JP, Yashica FX3, Leica M, Leica R, Diana F, Diana F mini, Ricoh. What if your camera is not in the above list? Do not worry! I have also created a universal accessory, which can be adjusted to almost all 35mm cameras. So if you have a Zenit, Alpa or other brand, you also will be able to use I'm Back®.Turn your analog camera into digital. Update - 07-21-2018The I'm Back has reduced its dimensions!

  Digital or analog? No need to choose, you have both.Pentax ME Super 50mm f1.7 + Im Back® 

 
Video by Pentax ME Super 50mm f1.7 + Im Back® I love photography, be it analogue or digital, and I love the great cameras that, by a sudden change of technology, ended up being archived and forgotten inside a box or drawer. So I couldn't stop thinking how to revive those wonderful vintage 35mm cameras.""It was during a hot summer night"" that I dreamed the I'm Back® device... After a few years of hard work and thousands of photos later, it's now possible to take your old camera out of the drawer, shoot pictures and even take videos in a very simple and quick way, with the same vintage flavour. The joy of joys is that I kept costs very low, not using large sensors, but through a system called ""image photo over the focusing screen"" and therefore the entire 24x36 area is optimised and digitally recorded. What they are talking about:""All I can say is “may God bless you”. I have been waiting 20 years for this product. I want one-where can I buy this wonderful piece of technology?I was a professional photographer in the 1970s. I have a wonderful (and very expensive) Canon F-1 system that I used for many years producing some beautiful shots. When the digital cameras came out, I tried a few and was frustrated and disappointed with the results (I was no longer a professional at that time). Now, with your brilliant I’m Back, I will be back working with my Canon F-1 and taking wonderful photos again! Thank you.""Tampa Florida USA - www.imback.eu - March 12, 2018""Ciao ho una Nikon f3, il vostro progetto mi entusiasma..."" G.L. - www.imback.eu - October 24, 2017""I am glad someone like you have such a great idea.

Kickstarter member - October 24, 2017""Hope you make it. Looks like the old Forsher Polaroid back for 35mm testing in the old days . Fabulous .""J.M.

Does it work for Nikon F100 Hope yes, please answer soon to support asap kickstarter campaign"" R.D. - Enquirer - www.imback.eu - March 17, 2017Who are talking about us... The design of this product is called ""Depth-of-field"" (DoF) adapter. In normal digital cameras, the image from the lens is directly projected onto the sensor. So the smaller the size of the sensor, the more the image is cropped which we call crop factor. In this DoF adapter ""digital back"", the image is projected onto the focusing screen.  And then we use a digital camera to take a photo of this focusing screen. There is no crop factor.  I'm Back® offers a 16mp Panasonic sensor that provides pictures and movies of 20, 16, 12, 8, 4, 2 mega pixels at your choice! Thanks to the focusing screen it will always maintain the nice vintage flavor of your 35mm camera. A smart 2"" touch screen display is included, making the device very user-friendly. Photos and videos can be transmitted through the WiFi and can be saved in your smartphone. You can also use the display of your smartphone, to have a bigger screen and to control the camera through it.   The PCB and the sensors may differ from the one showed at the pictures above, nevertheless the resolution and quality will be necessarily equal or higher. The result, as you can see in the photos published here, is something very special: although it is digital, it keeps the genuine flavor of your vintage camera. I'm Back® is unique in its kind; an extremely affordable solution to use your fantastic analogue photo-camera in a digital way. Try it! And, whenever you want, you can pull-off the back, put a roll of photographic films of your choice and shoot analogue photos like in the 1950s! I'm Back® joins the best of both worlds, analog and digital!  ""Mia"" my wife's cat. Nikon Fe 50mm 1.2 + I'm Back® I listened to all the comments and suggestions of the main photography forums on earth, and thanks to them I realised a new design resulting in a leaner, better and more functional device. I improved it with a small display and therefore the use of a smartphone is not necessary.  With a periscope system (two 45-degree mirrors), the posterior projection near the viewfinder decreases.2 ""touch screen display can be used as Live View Three buttons for; Turn on and off, access the menu, take photos or videos and connect the Wirelles ISO AUTO or MANUAL - 100 to 1600, EV Control, Foto resolution, 6, 8, 12, 20mp,  Withe balance,  Anti-Shaking,  HDR Scene, Video resolution and Language.  New and simple system to fit and lock the camera through two lateral clamps Bayonet system.

Now you can use smaller diaphragm openings that, thanks to the software, will lead your photos without dark edges.  I'm Back was intended for... for those who want to have fun and are tired to discuss about high resolutions and megapixels!!! Yes, because the magic about taking a photo is to study it, to click and why not, to make ""mistakes"", take it again and conceive a unique photo by analysing carefully the shape and not just caring about technology, as we used to do when we had only 36 poses clicking only when we were convinced to be ready.  I'm Back®.

<h3>Campaign Goal</h3>
<p>A cellphone camera is not an ideal solution for consistent quality and fine detail photography. This campaign's success will allow me to purchase a high-level camera capable of creating a portfolio to be published to a photo blog and printed out in large-scale format, such as wall-hanging canvas, to be sold in an accompanying online store. The proceeds of the store would go towards my return to college in order to further continue along my career path.</p>
<p>The camera I have chosen is the Nikon 1 AW1, which retails for $750 for a kit that includes 1 lens. This model was chosen for its waterproof &amp; shockproof ruggedness while still delivering reasonable fine detail and high quality results.</p>
<p>If the campaign does not succeed in reaching the goal, all funds remaining after transaction fees and perks will be put into the savings account for eventual purchase of the camera.</p>
</div>
<br/> <br/><h3>Stretch Goals</h3>The stated campaign goal is an initial milestone along an extensive path. As the title states, the milestones stretch from camera to college.

<h4>Nikon D810</h4>
<p><b>$4,000</b> : A higher-level camera body &amp; a couple lenses to further increase the fine detail &amp; quality of my photographs.</p>
<div>
<h4>Arborist Study Materials </h4>
<p><b>$5,000</b> : I am qualified to take the Certified Arborist exam through the International Society of Arboriculture and currently studying for it. These study materials are Continuing Education Units (CEUs) to reach the qualification necessary to take the Board Certified Master Arborist exam.</p>

<div>
<h4>Antipodes and Other Travel</h4>
<p><b>~$10,000 </b>: A photo set that I have in mind is a matched set of photos taken at exactly opposite points of the globe. One of the sets this is possible at, and be land-based at both places, is Christchurch Botanical Garden in New Zealand and the northern tip of Spain near A Coruña.</p>
<p>Scaled back, the travel would be to various botanical gardens nationally and regions with distinct plants.</p>

Turk's Cap
Malvaviscus arboreus var. drummondii


A different photo is added every other day. There are 21 photos spread over 42 days. A 22nd photo, a magnolia blossom, is a special only available as part of the full run. All are shown in the top image with those remaining faded out. The camera in the center is the desired result of this campaign.
The next photo will be put up at the end of the day on Tuesday, October 7.


 Currently...
All of these photos were taken by myself with a Kyocera Torque cellphone camera. They were selected from many taken over the past year as the best for display and printing. A cellphone camera is not ideal for consistent, fine-detail work.
My love of nature and eye for what would make a good photo are matched by a desire to share this knowledge and beauty with the world. A photo blog would be a good outlet. Many people have encouraged me to publish one as I kept showing them flower photos and telling them all about the plants.

<h3>Paying Attention to your Dreams </h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Since my first class in analog (darkroom) photography in high school, I've loved photography.  At the North Carolina School of Science I was lucky to live on a campus with almost 24 access to a darkroom and an awesome mentor (shout-out to Joe Liles!).  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Since then, through art classes at Brown University, photojournalism courses at PUC-Rio in Brazil, and documenting my travels through Latin America, my love of photography has only grown.  </span><br/></p>
<p>To me, photography goes beyond technicality; is about more than creativity.  It's about a way of looking at the universe, of noticing, of paying attention. Taking photos is an adventure into the world and it's wonders, and an adventure into my own perspective, my own soul.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time learning about photography, but have honestly always been a little intimidated to pursue it with greater professional and artistic commitment. This year I set some goals for myself. To make bold decisions and to follow through whether I feel ready or not. After all, if you wait till you feel ready, you might never do it at all.</p>
<p>So, ready or not, I'm diving in!</p>
<p>I'm currently working on putting up a photography exhibition at Early Girl Eatery in downtown, Asheville. It's an excellent opportunity for me to display art that I have worked very hard on over the last few years and that I care deeply about. It's a great way to open doors, and a jumping off point for committing myself wholeheartedly to doing more work with photography in the near future.</p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where does your money go?</h3> <p>Photography is an incredibly awesome, but expensive art. Printing, framing and hanging my photography for the exhibit alone costs nearly $500.  So your money goes directly into the cost of putting up the exhibit.</p>
<p>I've chosen indiegogo's flexible funding option, meaning that even if I don't meet my fundraising goal of $500, I'll still receive whatever has been raised when the deadline roles around.  The reason I've chose this option is because I took a leap of faith a few weeks ago and I am already working on this exhibit! It goes up on August 11th.  I've already made the commitment. I used my money that was supposed to be for bills and hacked into my meager savings to make this happen, trusting that the universe supports whole-hearted efforts.</p>
<p>Now I need your help to aid me in landing on solid ground after that leap of faith! </p>

<h3>What happens if I raise over $500?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Since indiegogo takes out a percentage of what I fundraise, the first place any extra money will go to will be to paying the site. After that, the first chunk of cash will go towards putting your perk packages together. </p>
<p>If I manage to raise enough money to pay for the exhibit to go up, cover indiegogo's fees and to pay for the cost of creating and sending your perks,  than any additional money will go towards furthering my creative work in photography in a variety of ways. Some possibilities include:</p>
<p>- Taking an advanced digital photography course to hone skills and continue building a knowledge base of how to use technology in the realm of photography. </p>
<p>- Acquiring a new computer that can handle storing and editing high quality images.</p>
<p>- Acquiring a lens (or two) that are better than my kit lens that came with my camera.  Because, as most photographers know, the quality of your lens affects your image way more than the body of your camera. Extra cash will definitely go towards funding photography equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>-Funding both big and small photography adventures where I can continue to build my portfolio, grow my body of work, and develop my skills.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>VIDDY is a screenprinted do-it-yourself pinhole camera kit made from tough, durable recycled card. It accepts both medium format and 35mm film. </h3>
<h1></h1>
<p>Each and every VIDDY is screenprinted and die-cut by hand in the UK and is available in 4 colours; Green, Black, Blue or Red. </p>
<p>VIDDY comes as a kit and the main pieces you'll need simply pop out so you'll go from flat pack to working camera in around half an hour! </p>
<p>Stickers and split pins are used to build the main body and you just need a small drop of glue to construct the film advance knobs. </p>
<p><b>There's no sharps, virtually no glue, and no mess.</b></p>
<p>Each VIDDY kit comes with everything you'll need to complete the camera, including a reclaimed medium format spool, a precision laser-cut pinhole, a red light-proof window, split pins, a sticker sheet and clear illustrated online instructions alongside an easy to follow how-to video. </p>
<p><b>It's simple, educational, fully functional and takes great photographs. But most importantly, it's fun!</b></p>

<p>A pinhole camera is a simple camera that uses a single small aperture - a pinhole - instead of a lens.</p>
<p>As light passes through this hole, an image is exposed onto the film loaded inside the camera. Exposure times are typically longer than with a normal lensed camera, due to the aperture being so much smaller. This means that pinhole cameras can typically take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to expose a photograph. Because of these long exposures the shutter is usually manually operated.</p>
<p>It strips complex photographic concepts down to their basic foundation: Light. How much to let in, and for how long!</p>

</div></div>","VIDDY is a screenprinted do-it-yourself pinhole camera kit made from tough, durable recycled card. It accepts both medium format and 35mm film. 

Each and every VIDDY is screenprinted and die-cut by hand in the UK and is available in 4 colours; Green, Black, Blue or Red. 
VIDDY comes as a kit and the main pieces you'll need simply pop out so you'll go from flat pack to working camera in around half an hour! 
Stickers and split pins are used to build the main body and you just need a small drop of glue to construct the film advance knobs. 
There's no sharps, virtually no glue, and no mess.
Each VIDDY kit comes with everything you'll need to complete the camera, including a reclaimed medium format spool, a precision laser-cut pinhole, a red light-proof window, split pins, a sticker sheet and clear illustrated online instructions alongside an easy to follow how-to video. 
It's simple, educational, fully functional and takes great photographs. But most importantly, it's fun!
















 Each VIDDY kit also comes with two decorative front sticker panels designed exclusively for this Kickstarter campaign by illustrators Becca Allen and Suzi Kemp. You'll receive both designs with your VIDDY kit. Check them out! 







A pinhole camera is a simple camera that uses a single small aperture - a pinhole - instead of a lens.
As light passes through this hole, an image is exposed onto the film loaded inside the camera. Exposure times are typically longer than with a normal lensed camera, due to the aperture being so much smaller. This means that pinhole cameras can typically take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to expose a photograph. Because of these long exposures the shutter is usually manually operated.
It strips complex photographic concepts down to their basic foundation: Light. How much to let in, and for how long!





 The VIDDY is the little sibling of our VIDERE pinhole camera.
(To read more about our first camera, VIDERE, check out our website.)
It's been in development for the past 6 months and is a direct result of the feedback we've received from the fantastic community of current Pop-Up Pinhole users. 

     This is our development method. It’s simple, but it works. 




We are always listening and making improvements to our designs. VIDDY is ever evolving and we'd love you to join the journey. 
VIDDY is easy to use, easy to load and has lots of new user experience features to make it our best model yet. These include a film viewing window, shutter indicator and virtually glue-free construction.
It's also the best kit yet for little hands and we've been successfully testing it in schools with children as young as 11 as part of educational workshops. Constructing a camera by hand that can take real photographs, using the simplest method possible, transforms complex concepts into hands-on understanding. 
So far the VIDDY has been used to teach subjects as wide-ranging as science, maths, history, art and design and engineering. 
When you support this project you'll not only be helping get the VIDDY get into production, but you'll also be be helping its development as an educational aid for use in schools and colleges. 




We could have just sent our VIDDY prototypes out to journalists and bloggers, but instead we decided to run a user testing programme and get the kits into the hands of the people that really matter: you!
We used what funds we had to make 80 VIDDY prototype kits, and we've been running testing sessions and workshops across the country and sending kits out for testing around the globe. They've been tried out everywhere from the south of Australia to San Francisco and our testers have varied from school kids to pro-baristas. We've also made sure we've tested them on everyone from pinhole fanatics to film photography virgins- we like to cover all bases!
If there's one thing we're certain of, it's that VIDDY definitely isn't just for photography buffs.

<p><strong>Our story</strong></p>
<p>We are Restrap, a British, family-run business specialising in hand-made outdoor accessories. We started life in a back bedroom in 2010. From a single sewing machine, founder Nathan began making accessories for the outdoor market, initially pedal straps for bicycles, and then bags and holsters. The back bedroom quickly became too small. Six years on and Restrap is now based in a large workshop on the outskirts of Leeds. We’re a close-knit team of outdoor enthusiasts, who design, develop and sew all our products by hand. We’re really proud of our Yorkshire roots and the landscape that’s inspired our products.</p>
</div></div>","The Sling
The Sling is a brand new, re-engineered camera strap from Restrap which gives photographers the power to switch cameras in seconds, shoot comfortably all day and keep their lens cap at touching distance at all times. 

 
Grip Sling 
The Grip Sling accompanies the Sling, keeping the camera firmly and comfortably attached to the hand for instant shooting. 

 
Cap Clip 
The revolutionary Cap Clip attaches to your Sling, belt or bag to keep your lens cap firmly in reach at all times. 

 
How does it work? 

 
These are “SNAPS”, dual 20mm magnetic connectors that make a solid link between your camera and the Sling. 
Attach one to your camera and it will seamlessly connect to the Sling straps for effortless photography. 
No more tugging straps or pulling buckles. The SNAPS allow you to attach, adjust, detach and change cameras in a matter of seconds. Photography on the go has never been easier.   
 
Our full range also includes our unique magnetic cap system. Attach our magnetic connector using the adhesive backing to the lens cap and shoot away. 
 
The two straps 
The Sling: an ergonomically designed shoulder strap that holds your camera in place across the shoulder or neck. Fully padded and adjustable for all sizes. 
The Sling is available with the option of three padding colours: black, orange and grey.

It's little brother the Grip attaches to the hand, allowing you to keep your camera close for those unforeseen photo opportunities. Like the Sling, we’ve got your comfort in mind, with padding and easy adjustment. 


Both versions contain magnetic quick release buckles so you can easily change between cameras.
Best of all, our straps are hand-made in Yorkshire, UK by a dedicated team who love photography as much as you do.
 
Strength and security

Materials 

The techy part...
Both the Sling and Grip Sling are made from high quality, performance materials:
Double layered, lightweight and breathable neoprene padding which fits the shoulder and neck perfectly. Available in black, orange and grey.
Super strong, lazercut Hypalon™ structure, famed for its resistance to extreme weather conditions.

Diego Delso is known as Poco a poco in Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. In case you don't know, Wikimedia Commons is a media file repository where anyone can share freely-licensed content with everyone. Wikipedia (the free encyclopedia you use every day), and every other Wikimedia project, uses Wikimedia Commons as its image repository, so, in fact, most of the times you view (or download) an image in Wikipedia, you are actually viewing a Wikimedia Commons image. 
While Diego is just one of the thousands of Wikimedia Commons volunteers, he is a very special one: he's one of the main Wikimedia Commons contributors ever, having some amazing records, such as being the user with the highest amount of Featured Pictures (153 images) and quality images (5,777 images). That's an awesome amount of very high quality material, that Diego has given to every living person for free.

Furthermore, Diego has contributed in Wikimedia Commons in other ways. One of them is by supporting (by being an organizer or a jury) two of the most important photographic contests in the Wikimedia movement (and in the world!): Wiki Loves Monuments and Wiki Loves Earth.

Sadly, while Diego was in Buenos Aires after participating in a Wikimedia Iberoamerican meeting with other Wikimedia volunteers, he got his equipment stolen. In this unfortunate event, he didn't only lost his camera, zoom lenses and laptop, but also every single picture he took during his 2 weeks trip in South America, which he was going to upload to Wikimedia Commons so they could be used by everyone, everywhere.

As Wikimedia volunteers and Diego's friends, we could not stand aside of this, so we decided to help him to restore his equipment. You can help, too, by contributing to this campaign!Our goal is simple: to collect enough money to help Diego to buy exactly the same equipment he lost.
The gear he lost in Argentina is described below, with a reference to the price from Amazon for the same equipment.

EspañolDiego Delso es conocido como Poco a poco en Wikipedia y Wikimedia Commons. Por si no lo sabes, Wikimedia Commons es un repositorio multimedia donde cualquier persona puede compartir contenido con licencia libre con todos. Wikipedia (la enciclopedia libre que usas todos los días), al igual que todos los demás proyectos Wikimedia, usa Wikimedia Commons como su repositorio de imágenes, así que, de hecho, la mayoría de veces que ves (o descargas) una imagen de Wikipedia, realmente estás viendo una imagen de Wikimedia Commons. 
A pesar de que Diego es sólo uno de los miles de voluntarios de Wikimedia Commons, es uno muy especial: es uno de los principales contribuyentes a Wikimedia Commons en toda su historia, teniendo algunos récords impresionantes, como ser el usuario con la mayor cantidad de Imágenes Destacadas (153 imágenes) y, al mismo tiempo, la mayor cantidad de Imágenes de Calidad (5,777 imágenes). Es una cantidad sorprendente de material de muy alta calidad, que Diego ha donado a todas las personas del mundo.

Para ir más allá, Diego ha contribuido en Wikimedia Commons de otros modos. Uno de ellos es mediante el apoyo (siendo organizador o jurado) a dos de los concursos fotográficos más importantes del movimiento Wikimedia (¡y del mundo!): Wiki Loves Monuments y Wiki Loves Earth.
Lastimosamente, mientras que Diego estaba en Buenos Aires tras participar de un encuentro Iberoamericano de Wikimedistas, personas inescrupulosas robaron su equipo fotográfico. En este evento desafortunado, Diego no sólo perdió su cámara, lentes y computador portátil, sino también todas las fotografías que había tomado durante su viaje de 2 semanas por Sudamérica, que iba a subir a Wikimedia Commons para que pudieran ser usadas por cualquier persona, en cualquier lugar.
Como voluntarios del movimiento Wikimedia y amigos de Diego, no podríamos quedarnos sin hacer nada, así que decidimos ayudarlo a restablecer su equipo. ¡Tú también puedes ayudar contribuyendo a esta campaña!
Nuestra meta es simple: reunir suficiente dinero para ayudar a Diego a comprar de nuevo el equipo que perdió.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

An amazing photo conveys emotions. Taking a great photo of something we feel passionate about gives us – and our audience – an incredible feeling.

It’s simply easier, more accessible, and less bulky. However, we all know how it feels when a blurry photograph is all that remains of a perfect moment.</p><p>Words can’t explain everything. We want to give our mobile photos the chance to reach into our hearts, to go beyond “beautiful”, “gorgeous”, and “amazing”.

An amazing photo conveys emotions. Taking a great photo of something we feel passionate about gives us – and our audience – an incredible feeling. Whether it's a magnificent mountain, the glorious sunset, an architectural wonder, our favorite person / animal, etc., we all have something that we love to photograph.We’ve been reaching increasingly for our phones to capture memories. It’s simply easier, more accessible, and less bulky. However, we all know how it feels when a blurry photograph is all that remains of a perfect moment.Words can’t explain everything. We want to give our mobile photos the chance to reach into our hearts, to go beyond “beautiful”, “gorgeous”, and “amazing”. That means giving more people the ability to capture images beyond the current limits of mobile photography. This is why we set out to create OOWA, the highest-quality mobile photography lenses in the market.OOWA lenses are unlike any other. Our patented free-form technology is uniquely optimized for translating the image circle onto the iPhone's rectangular sensor. This results in superior edge-to-edge image quality with no dark corners and no color bleeding. Mobile photography will never be the same again.We are thrilled to finally launch our first set of lenses - a 15mm wide-angle lens, and a 2.5X zoom lens for the iPhone 6 series. Join the mobile photography revolution. Pre-order your OOWA lenses on Indiegogo now! (Not an iPhone 6, 6+, 6S or 6S+ user? Click here to help us select our next phone model.)  Click here for an in-depth review of our lenses by Mashable.  15mm Wide-Angle LensBring the out of range into reach. Perfect for that mountaintop shot, a table-full of delicious delights, and a full-screen shot of our puppy’s nose. 2.5X TelephotoGet intimate from afar. Get up-close with your favorite band, sneak a photo of the cute skateboarder across the street, or make someone’s smile the highlight of the day.   Here are some beautiful images taken with OOWA lenses.  Our lenses come with a complementary case. We looked towards pro-cameras for inspiration in our design. Equipped with bayonet mounts, the lenses are attached to the case with a simple twist.  In The LabWe have entire walls and ceilings in our lab and office covered in dots. Literally like this.We take photographs of these dots with various products, carefully cut up the image and then examine the image quality of every single dot, at every single position. Compared to the leading competitor OOWA especially at the edges, performs better on measures of image sharpness (Spatial Frequency Response / SFR) and color bleeding (lateral chromatic aberration). In The FieldThe image below was taken with the OOWA 2.5x telephoto lens. The area circled in red is shown close-up to review in greater detail. Notice how the white base of the pavilion has a straight color edge against the black shadows. The image below was taken with a leading brand's 2x telephoto lens, standing in the same spot. The area circled in red is shown close-up to review in greater detail. Notice how the white base bleeds blue vertically into the black shadows below, and bleeds yellow on the left. Read more about our image quality in Martyn William's review for PC World.   What are free-form lenses? The differentiating feature of a free-form lens is that it is rotationally asymmetrical.

<h3><b>5 Degrees
of Freedom</b></h3>
<p>The 6 thrusters provide the CCROV 5 degrees of freedom: <b>forward &amp; back,

adjust in response to the IMU statues. </p>
<p>Its flexible mobility and precise control make the CCROV maneuverable
within 1m³. With an average of 3 thrusters, most ROV will need three times that
area to complete a circle.</p>

</div></div>","The underwater world has drawn more and more attention over the past few years.
After realizing that there was no option for a high-quality professional camera or ROV at a reasonable price for the general consumer, we decided to develop a professional grade underwater drone at the
lowest price-the CCROV.





“It's a seriously precise drone, too, being manoeuvrable to within 1 square metre where most ROVs need an area three times that size in order to complete a circle.”Joe Svetlik, Trusted Reviews

“Designed for both research and recreational use, the CCROV
allows scuba divers to share their adventure with guests on board as well as
professionally document their discoveries with the option to connect an FPV or
VR headset to experience the footage in 3D.” 5
YACHTING START-UPS TO INVEST IN NOW 

“In fact, it should even be able to venture well into technical diving
territory at depths where human divers would require special breathing gas
mixtures and lengthy decompression stops to prevent them succumbing to the
bends.” Mike
Tomkinsmkins, Imaging Resource




A remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is
a tethered underwater mobile device. They are common in deep water industries. We created a ROV which is mainly used for underwater photography. The CCROV (CC=See the Sea) with its 4K camera, 6 thrusters and 5 degrees of freedom,
will provide you a professional
experience at an affordable price. 









4K
Camera

As for now, most underwater drones or robots use HD (720P) or 1080P
camera, but we aim for the highest quality of video footage, this is why we
decided to equip the CCROV with a 4K camera.This built-in camera will
help you get the clearest underwater videos and photos. 



Camera specs




6
Thrusters

A ROV usually have 3 to 4 thrusters. To enjoy a
high stability we incorporated 4
horizontal and 2 vertical thrusters on the CCROV.












5 Degrees
of Freedom
The 6 thrusters provide the CCROV 5 degrees of freedom: forward & back,
up & down, right & left, yaw and the roll axis will automatically
adjust in response to the IMU statues. 
Its flexible mobility and precise control make the CCROV maneuverable
within 1m³. With an average of 3 thrusters, most ROV will need three times that
area to complete a circle.











Ultra-resistant
to Pressure and Anti-corrosion

The CCROV’s electronic components are placed in an aluminum alloy sealed compartment that can resist high water
pressure. This compartment is embedded in military
grade syntactic foam that not only provides stability but also avoids
erosion from sea water.This system assures the impermeability of the CCROV up to 100 meters deep.






Professional
Tether Deployment System (TDS)

The CCROV has a professional tether
deployment system that allows an easy packing and transportation. The  battery is located in the Tether Deployment System, it is removable and can be replaced while it's charging (90 minutes for a full charge) for an uninterrupted use of your CCROV. The tether’s
length ranges from 20 meters to 100 meters, and no matter the length, this
system makes it easy to manage. 






Here is what the CCROV has to offer








Here are some use cases for the CCROV
Check diving spotsSwim along with the divers Follow diversInspect boat before sailing awayThe CCROV was used for shooting the International Free Diving Championship 


                   The free diving champion (Jessea Lu with the CCROV)Vacation with family in Malaysia 



Though it is a
professional ROV, it is still very portable.
It can be easily carried in a backpack or a suitcase, even placed under your
seat. 
Take it along anywhere you go! Easy to use and ready to dive right out of
your backpack!
















Easy
to Use 





The
CCROV is easy to set up and user friendly, in three steps you are good to go:
-  Download and install the app (iOS and
Android) on your phone/tablet
- 
Connect your phone (and the controller if you want to use it) to the Tether
Deployment System via Wi-Fi
- 
Open the app and in one click, connect it to the CCROV.









Live Video Feedback

The CCROV will send live video feedback through the tether up to the
surface. The signal will then be streamed by Wi-Fi from the Tether Deployment
System to your phone/tablet/controller. 
Our company has experience in providing video transmission modules designed
for drones, so high speed and HD video transmission is kind of our advantage. 




VR/FPV Interface

We take a step further with Virtual Reality! Your CCROV will take you
through a real life experience under water. Swim in the ocean with a school of
fish in glorious 3-D, flow with the stream and discover the underwater world.



Personalized Color Customization



We will have different colors available. For now we have apple green and lemon
yellow prototypes and if you want new colors then we will personalize it for
you! Get your own customized CCROV!







The price of an underwater camera with 1080P video is usually above USD 1,000
and the professional ROVs are usually more than USD 20,000.
We aim for the best quality and want to provide a professional experience while being at the lowest possible price.

Our goal was to realize the perfect bundle, capable of satisfying any videomaker's needs in terms of camera movements: from a simple manual control to triple motorization control. It enables you to produce complex shootings or timelapse easily, thanks to the simplest remote control you already have in the pocket: your smartphone!  WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURESMODULARITY AND FLEXIBILITYWe design several solutions to provide easy plug of each element. In order to construct any specific set, every module is match-able mutually with the others in various way. V-SHAPE CONNECTIONSThe V shape of our connection systems is the best way to eliminate any backlash, resulting in a unique solid piece that allows impeccably smooth movements.    MOTOR MAGNETIC PLUGThe system is equiped with a unique plug and play motor coupling solution that allows the fastest mounting capability on the market. THE APPStarslider can be controlled by an accompanying app for  iOS, OSX and Android, that allows live control and configuration of preset, timelapse and stop motion. Set your start and your end points, add keyframes where you want and input duration/intervals/speed to suit:You have the ability to apply bezier curves for smoother moves, loop, save for repeatability, and bulb ramping.

PRESET CTRLIf you want to accurately design your shot you have to meet Starslider Preset Control. You can save and reload the same transition to shot it again in the same or different situations.  The Preset Control allows you to set multiple key-frames at different positions of the camera. Our algorythm calculates the interpolation and does the rest: it makes the transition smooth and guarantees fluid dynamics from the start to the end.  TIMELAPSETimelapse mode allows you to set the transition - the same way of Presets - using pictures instead video recordings. The Control Unit can communicate directly with your camera thanks to the universal shutter release cable, and you can set everything you need on your device. TECHNICAL SPECS THE CONTROL UNIT The control unit is the brain and the heart of the project. The power source is a battery with a standard V-lock adapter or a generic power supply. There are 3 output ports (12v, 7.2v, 5v) to feed your device, monitor, or other tools; 4 Ethernet connections to control the motors, and an intervalometer plug to control timelapse.
 

DEMOWe want to demonstrate how fast and easy is to take control of Starslider.In 2 minutes you can.. take your smartphone, go to wifi settings, connect to STARLSIDER, go to the application, launch it, select Live Control, play with default settings, change speed, increase acceleration, play again with Live Control, go back to the menu, choose Preset Mode, point a target moving three axis, set a keypoint, move the camera along starslider, point the focus again on the target moving pan and tilt, set the end point, play the transition - too fast - increase the duration, playback the transition. Ok, that's awesome! In only two minutes. GET WHAT YOU NEED AND DON'T FORGET THE EXTRAS.Do you desire extended features? The add-ons allow you to easily carry on your new flexible equipment or simply to extend the potentiality of it. Choose what you prefer and contact us to add the amount to your pledge.TEAMWe are a team of young professionals in the field of industrial design and industrial production, with a passion for videomaking. We developed Starslider to respond to two requests:a tool that allows the videomaker to produce interviews by himself (with the assistance of a remote control) and a robotic arm to make a product's video. We started our journey with these specific needs, working with talented engineers and collaborating with filmmakers & photographers in order to improve, prototype after prototype, our vision and product.“A good tool shouldn't be complicated or too expensive to utilize, whether you are a professional or an enthusiast, everyone has the possibility to realize their creativity.”  Product Designer - Marco FarmachidiIndustrial Engineer - Giovanni SchirinziMechanical Designer - Michele SalamoneUX Designer - Gionata Fronduti Electronic and Software Engineer - Nazmus SakibElectronic and Software Engineer - Luay YariFront-end, App Development - Pietro Di CostanzoStrategy Consulting  - Viola XuComunication & PR - Filippo RebuzziniVideomaker -  Andrea RevelliPhotographer - Marco Verna, Gabriele Daccardi RISKS AND CHALLENGESWe have already secured trusted partners in order to ensure the project flows as planned. The production includes several components with a high precision and complex proprietary electronics; therefore while we don't foresee any complications, potential supply chain issues or tweaking in the design may occur. We'll keep the community informed with prompt updates.",12.0,5,"1 Campaign

<p>Documenting Dystopia sounds like the title of a book or movie. It is the actually the name of a website born out of the vision of a man who had noticed the significant, rapid increase in the number of surveillance cameras all over the country. He realized that this is a red flag that warns us of the impending elimination of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p><br/>At the same time, he realized that the American People haven’t a clue about what is happening because most media outlets are not reporting on stories like these.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">How it Started</span></h3>
<p><br/>Documenting Dystopia was born out of a dire and obvious need for <strong>government transparency, </strong>especially involving the surveillance of lawful citizens.</p>
<p><br/>In August 2012, the story of an orwellian surveillance software known as Trapwire, began to make waves across independant media, thanks the ""GI FILES"" from Wikileaks.</p>
<p><br/>Out of disgust with the increasingly powerful surveillance state, that in many cases seems intent to silence free speech demonstrators, I created a collaborative google map called #TrackingTrapwire, with the intention of locating and exposing the location of the surveillance systems.</p>
<p><strong> Within less than a month we had received over a hundred thousand hits to the map.</strong></p>
<p><br/>This initial idea quickly expanded into what is now as Documenting Dystopia, which has over 2450 cameras in 4 countries and growing. Users are submitting pictures of cameras in their local areas.</p>
<p>Currently, anyone can send in pictures of surveillance cameras for us to pin on the map. This can be done using location data stored in the picture on a smart phone, or users can map the cameras themselves easily in Google Earth, and then send us their map.  We are working to automate this process in secure and efficient methods</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact and reciprocal transparency<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">:</span></strong></h3>
<p>Funded properly, Documenting Dystopia will become a driving force for transparency in public surveillance systems. Through public exposure, incentivized camera finding, and petitioning, we could make the public much more aware of the dangers that our surveillance state presents, and get them engaged and active in supporting the transparency we seek.</p>
<p><br/>Additionally, by creating a public service camera directory we would be dividing up the power of ""big brother"" and even those in the upper echelons of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, would be subject to the prying eyes of the cameras as everyday citizens become able to look through those same eyes.</p>

<p>CLUBS are dedicated to Technicals. I collated the most important topics such as manual shooting, white balance, color theory, understanding and reading a histogram, understanding the different types of filters, metering modes, RAW &amp; JPG, focus modes and drive modes. Once again, all topics are described with custom illustrations.</p>
<p>DIAMONDS describe different Shooting Styles and the most commonly used settings. I illustrated styles like flash photography, macro, sports &amp; motion, portrait photography &amp; bokeh, landscape, sunset, night, astro &amp; long exposure among other topcs.</p>

Imagine a super useful camera reference sheet which is printed on a deck of uniquely designed playing cards
Each numbered card illustrates the most important rules and techniques about photography. Each of the court cards has uniquely designed camera artwork.
Think of them as pocket-sized cheat sheets that you can bring wherever you travel.
The info on the cards can be combined so you will have everything you need for ANY shooting situation. 

 
The cards make a unique gift for anyone who likes cameras. No matter if you are shooting on a compact, mirrorless, DSLR or even your smartphone: This is the perfect travel companion and addition for your camera bag.

</h3><h3>
<br/>Short Summary</h3><div> <p>If you're a fan of independent professional wrestling, you've seen his photos.  Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.  Ring of Honor.  Evolve.  Dragon Gate USA.  All Pro Wrestling.  Hoodslam.  Big Time Wrestling.  Championship Wrestling from Hollywood.  Gold Rush Pro Wrestling.  He's shot them all.</p>
<p>His photos have been tweeted and retweeted thousands of times by some of the biggest names in professional wrestling.  His photos have been used as the basis of t-shirts sold by wrestlers through prowrestlingtees.com.  His photos have been used for the artwork of PWG and ROH DVDs.<br/></p>
<p>During the main event of Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's eleventh anniversary show, a Guerrilla Warfare match between The Young Bucks and Candice LaRae &amp; Joey Ryan, photographer Devin Chen's camera was broken--the lens snapped from the camera.  This unfortunate occupational hazard puts Devin out a few thousand dollars and takes away the instrument he would use to make money to replace it.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>This is where you come in!<br/>
</h3> <ul>
<li>Let's help Devin get back to his spot ringside where he gets some of the best photos of independent professional wrestling around.</li>
<li>Every cent donated through this campaign will go directly to paying for Devin's replacement camera.  If by your generosity, we raise more than we need, the money will go to other supplies that will help Devin get even better shots than he gets now. <br/>
</li> <li>As a thank you for donating to this cause, we have a number of different perks we're offering, ranging from photos, autographed photos, and even the camera broken during the match!<br/>
</li> <li>If we don't reach our entire goal, the money will still go a long way in helping Devin get back to shooting the high quality photos that have made him known as one of the best photographers in independent pro wrestling.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>What the money is specifically going towards:<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canon EOS-5D Mark III Digital SLR Camera Body, 22.3 Megapixel</li>
<li>Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens with Case and Lens Hood <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>Devin loves sharing his photos with the wrestling community.  He comes to most shows with envelops of photos that he gives out to both fans and wrestlers.  He spends countless hours editing and uploading his photos so people who couldn't attend a particular show can still witness the magic of the event.  He needs our help to keep doing this!<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know that everyone who sees this doesn't have the money to donate.  That doesn't mean you can't help!  Here are some other ways you can help:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Tell your friends.  Tweet about it.  Post about it.  Message about it.  Youtube about it.  Instagram about it.  Podcast about it.  Text about it.  Even Snapchat about it!  Let people know about this little campaign we're running to help out not only a pro wrestling photographer, but a fellow pro wrestling fan.<br/>

</div></div>","Note (12/27/14): Sorry it has taken so long, but my goal is to get everything sent out by the first week of January.  Thanks for being patient, everybody!

Short Summary If you're a fan of independent professional wrestling, you've seen his photos.  Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.  Ring of Honor.  Evolve.  Dragon Gate USA.  All Pro Wrestling.  Hoodslam.  Big Time Wrestling.  Championship Wrestling from Hollywood.  Gold Rush Pro Wrestling.  He's shot them all.
His photos have been tweeted and retweeted thousands of times by some of the biggest names in professional wrestling.  His photos have been used as the basis of t-shirts sold by wrestlers through prowrestlingtees.com.  His photos have been used for the artwork of PWG and ROH DVDs.
During the main event of Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's eleventh anniversary show, a Guerrilla Warfare match between The Young Bucks and Candice LaRae & Joey Ryan, photographer Devin Chen's camera was broken--the lens snapped from the camera.  This unfortunate occupational hazard puts Devin out a few thousand dollars and takes away the instrument he would use to make money to replace it.  
  This is where you come in!
 
Let's help Devin get back to his spot ringside where he gets some of the best photos of independent professional wrestling around.
Every cent donated through this campaign will go directly to paying for Devin's replacement camera.  If by your generosity, we raise more than we need, the money will go to other supplies that will help Devin get even better shots than he gets now. 
 As a thank you for donating to this cause, we have a number of different perks we're offering, ranging from photos, autographed photos, and even the camera broken during the match!
 If we don't reach our entire goal, the money will still go a long way in helping Devin get back to shooting the high quality photos that have made him known as one of the best photographers in independent pro wrestling.


What the money is specifically going towards:


Canon EOS-5D Mark III Digital SLR Camera Body, 22.3 Megapixel
Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens with Case and Lens Hood 




  Risks & Challenges 
Devin loves sharing his photos with the wrestling community.  He comes to most shows with envelops of photos that he gives out to both fans and wrestlers.  He spends countless hours editing and uploading his photos so people who couldn't attend a particular show can still witness the magic of the event.  He needs our help to keep doing this!
 
  Other Ways You Can Help We know that everyone who sees this doesn't have the money to donate.  That doesn't mean you can't help!  Here are some other ways you can help: 
Tell your friends.  Tweet about it.  Post about it.  Message about it.  Youtube about it.  Instagram about it.  Podcast about it.  Text about it.  Even Snapchat about it!  Let people know about this little campaign we're running to help out not only a pro wrestling photographer, but a fellow pro wrestling fan.

There are 3 ways to use mini Plaster Hand, it was designed to be used at any environment anytime conveniently. Mode A Suitable place : Any flat surfaceJust put it on a flat surface and done! This is the quickest way to use mini Plaster Hand! You even do not need to press the strap and let it flatten. Press the back of the plate lightly could enhance stability on rough surface, while you do not need to press if it is already in balance. You could also mount your long lens with a quick plate and a tripod head on it, with making adjustment accordingly. Mode B Suitable place : Any horizontal cylinder (1-4 secounds)Wrap the strap on curved rail and put it through from the front hole to the rear hole, and tighten it. Then place the middle part downward, and put it through the middle part. Lastly, wrap the rest of the strap to the rail and hold it by hand. Set the self-time on camera to 2 sec or more and done! It would be safer to slide the strap obliquely via the hinge, as it is a safety design to prevent any accidental fall of the camera. 
Mode C Suitable place : Any horizontal cylinder (5-60 secounds)

Put it on a curved surface and pass the strap through the back. Pull it upward and hold downward to tighten the strap. Put the middle accessory to the bottom and counter weight by a bag or any heavy stuff, and it will be perfectly secured. You can set the exposure time even longer.
 

Steps for usage

Notice before usage

<p>Photography is my greatest joy, my contemplation, my
expression. I’m out photographing every day. </p>
<p>I used to have a wonderful camera, but after more than ten
years of constant use, it died about 2 years ago - All the photos you’ve seen
over the past few years have been taken just on my iPhone. I sadly can’t afford
a new camera on one nonprofit salary - So I’m hoping you can help me.</p><p><b>Photography &lt;3</b></p>
<p>What I most like about photography is its ability to help
the viewer appreciate an aspect of the world that we are usually too busy to
notice. My pictures try to hold pieces of the beautiful world up to your eyes for
you to wonder at. I love the medium of the camera and lens, with their ability
to focus and distort what we see in order to bring to our eyes aspects of the
view that we couldn't see unaided. And of course, the storytelling of images, the
connection. </p>
<p><b>Why do I need a camera? </b></p><p>I could create the beautiful images that reside in my imagination, rather than struggling with the limits of a phone. With a real camera, I can tell the stories I see, return to
serious photography, express my artistic vision, exhibit my work, produce
gigantic, high-quality prints, learn portraiture and other new skills, maybe
even publish a book of my photography. These are all real opportunities that I’ve
had to turn down over the past year because I didn’t have the equipment. With a camera, I can say yes to art.</p><p><b>What will the money buy?</b></p>
<p>The camera that could serve my needs costs a LOT of money. (For you camera nerds - Canon EOS 5D Mark III) With all the lenses and filters and other accouterments, it'll actually cost more than the $5K I’m trying to raise here – I’m chipping in all I can
spare myself for this. If I raise less than my goal, I'll buy a similar but
less sophisticated model (Mark II). If I raise more, I'll get nicer lenses, and filters, lights, reflective umbrellas...! </p>
<p>I’ve hesitated for years

</div>","Photography is my greatest joy, my contemplation, my
expression. I’m out photographing every day. 
I used to have a wonderful camera, but after more than ten
years of constant use, it died about 2 years ago - All the photos you’ve seen
over the past few years have been taken just on my iPhone. I sadly can’t afford
a new camera on one nonprofit salary - So I’m hoping you can help me.Photography <3
What I most like about photography is its ability to help
the viewer appreciate an aspect of the world that we are usually too busy to
notice. My pictures try to hold pieces of the beautiful world up to your eyes for
you to wonder at. I love the medium of the camera and lens, with their ability
to focus and distort what we see in order to bring to our eyes aspects of the
view that we couldn't see unaided. And of course, the storytelling of images, the
connection. 
Why do I need a camera? I could create the beautiful images that reside in my imagination, rather than struggling with the limits of a phone. With a real camera, I can tell the stories I see, return to
serious photography, express my artistic vision, exhibit my work, produce
gigantic, high-quality prints, learn portraiture and other new skills, maybe
even publish a book of my photography. These are all real opportunities that I’ve
had to turn down over the past year because I didn’t have the equipment. With a camera, I can say yes to art.What will the money buy?
The camera that could serve my needs costs a LOT of money. (For you camera nerds - Canon EOS 5D Mark III) With all the lenses and filters and other accouterments, it'll actually cost more than the $5K I’m trying to raise here – I’m chipping in all I can
spare myself for this. If I raise less than my goal, I'll buy a similar but
less sophisticated model (Mark II). If I raise more, I'll get nicer lenses, and filters, lights, reflective umbrellas...! 
I’ve hesitated for years
to spend this much money on my own art, and I know there are many worthy things
you can put your money towards, but I’ll promise to use this camera to share beauty and tell important stories. (And it would bring me such great joy!)I can't do this alone
I truly can’t do this without you. I'm grateful that I can cover my basic needs, but I don't make enough to save up for this kind of expense. Please chip in any amount
today, and you’ll get all kinds of expressions of my gratitude!

<h3>Me,</h3>
<p>My name is Sam Masoni, currently working as a field guide/ranger on a small privately owned game reserve. I'm 23 years old and have a strong passion for wildlife and educating and showing people the animals I get to work with there is a great opportunity for me to enhance my photography here as we also do wildlife/safari weddings and photoshoots. Photography has always been a passion of mine starting from school days, taking photography class and getting to use the schools camera. I fell in love with photography right away. Now having the chance to capture the true beauty of these wild animal and being able to sow the work it is a dream come true. </p>
<p>I would like to start printing and creating post cards with my pictures to show the world our animal in an area where there is NO hunting. Seeing the calmness in the animals eyes is a true capture. My camera lens has broken and therefor I cannot take anymore pictures. I would love to start shooting again and taking 1000's of photos again.  </p>
<p>Any donations will allow me to get my lens fixed(if possible) or allow me to get the right equipment for wildlife photography and the equipment for editing for printing after capturing. I have repaired my lens before and having photography as a hobby it is as everyone knows its an expensive hobby, thus I want to start doing something with my photography skills and passion. </p>
<h3>Funds,</h3>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<p>All funds raised will go straight into photography gear, even if short of my goal. I want to buy a new camera with lenses and even try to join another photography class on wildlife photography to better my skills. Brand new gear is always better than second hand used gear as you never know if used gear will break 2 months after having it. Perks, shipment is expensive although once i'm back to capturing the beauty of these wild animals I will send my best shots on a personalized postcard.</p>
<p>Gear I need - A new Camera (Canon or Nikon), wide lenses, short lenses and 200-300mm lenses and the long lens 600/800mm. Along with a protective camera bag to fit all lenses</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can not start this phase of my photography without the help of anyone who is willing to contribute towards this campaign to help me start back up. If i don't have any contribution to help me start I will have to keep trying to win competitions in magazines and online, however everyone that enters has amazing equipment already. This is  my chance to get my pictures out there.  </p>
<p>I know there are many people who can not contribute with funds but everyone knows someone who knows someone out there that might be able to help me. Please share my campaign to everyone you know. </p>

Projekts „Und der Name des Sterns heißt Demut – Nahaufnahmen aus Tschernobyl“<br/></b>
</p><ul><li>Ich bin
     Alexander Kaschte, 36 Jahre alt, Autor, Musiker und freier Fotograf aus
     Marburg an der Lahn. Ich interessiere mich seit längerem für die
     menschlichen Aspekte der Tschernobyl-Katastrophe. Meine Erinnerungen an
     den Reaktorunfall, dessen Auswirkungen ich als Kind kurz vor Ende des
     Kalten Krieges und vor dem Hintergrund der revitalisierten
     Anti-Atomkraftbewegung in Deutschland miterlebt habe, sind nie verblasst.
     Fukushima ereignete sich wenige Wochen, nachdem meine Tochter in Moskau
     geboren wurde – der Unfall in Japan hat Tschernobyl wieder verstärkt in das
     Zentrum meiner Wahrnehmung und künstlerischen Arbeit gerückt. Ich
     engagiere mich seitdem ehrenamtlich in einem Verein, der Kindern aus von
     der Reaktorkatastrophe betroffenen Familien Erholungsaufenthalte in
     Deutschland ermöglicht. Ich habe in den vergangenen zwei Jahren mehrmals
     die Ukraine bereist und dabei Menschen und Schicksale kennengelernt, von
     denen ich in Wort und Bild erzählen und berichten möchte. Durch meine
     Vereinsarbeit konnte ich vor Ort ein zuverlässiges Netzwerk aus Freunden,
     Unterstützern und Kontaktpersonen aufbauen.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ziel
     meiner Kampagne ist die Veröffentlichung einer Fotodokumentation, die sich
     jenen Menschen widmet, die auch heute noch unmittelbar von Tschernobyl
     betroffen sind. Das gesammelte Material soll der Öffentlichkeit in
     Buchform, als Ausstellung und in Vorträgen zugänglich gemacht werden. Es
     geht mir bei meiner Arbeit weniger um den Reaktor und die von Extremtouristen
     und Sensationsfotografen tausendfach fotografierte Geisterstadt Prypjat,
     obwohl auch meine Dokumentation nicht ohne Fotos dieser Art auskommen
     wird. Im Vordergrund haben aber die Menschen zu stehen, die aus Prypjat
     evakuiert wurden, die Rückkehrerinnen, die ihren Lebensabend bewusst auf
     kontaminiertem Boden in der Sperrzone verbringen, alle, die zum Zeitpunkt
     der Katastrophe Kinder waren und heute selbst Kinder haben. Auch hoffe
     ich, durch diese Kampagne mein Netzwerk weiter ausbauen und Verbindungen
     knüpfen zu können, die später in der Gründung eines eigenen Vereins münden
     sollen. Das Ziel dieses Vereins wird es sein, Kinder aus den Zonen 2 und 3
     der Tschernobyl-Region langfristig in Belangen ihrer schulischen Bildung
     zu begleitet, ihnen ein Studium zu ermöglichen und den Austausch mit
     europäischen Universitäten zu organisieren. Der Verein soll mit seiner
     Arbeit da ansetzen, wo die Arbeit Erholungsurlaube ermöglichender Vereine
     aufhört.</li></ul><p></p>
<ul><li>Wer
     mich bei dieser Kampagne unterstützt, hilft bei der Realisierung eines
     sehr persönlichen und zutiefst menschlichen Projektes, das nicht nur für
     mich von großer Bedeutung ist. Ich erinnere mich genau an die Unsicherheit
     meiner Eltern, als Kinder im Mai 1986 nicht im Regen spielen und auch
     nicht durch Pfützen laufen durften - als im Sommer das Pflücken von
     Löwenzahn verboten war, niemand wusste, ob man Kuhmilch noch trinken kann
     und das Gemüse im Garten größer wuchs als je zuvor. Als Vater eines Kindes
     und als Mensch, der die schrecklichen Folgen des weltweit schwersten
     Unfalls in einem Kernkraftwerk mehrfach mit eigenen Augen gesehen hat, kann
     ich nicht verstehen, wie man Atomkraft noch positiv bewerten kann. Mit
     meiner Kampagne möchte ich zu einer weiteren Sensibilisierung bezüglich
     des Themenkomplexes beitragen und die Erinnerung am Leben erhalten: Fast
     30 Jahre nach der Havarie gerät Tschernobyl weiter in Vergessenheit,
     obwohl Menschen immer noch an den Folgen des Unfalls sterben.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1098477/files/20141215140423-IMG_5663.JPG?1418681063"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<ul><li>Zur
     Realisierung von <span>„Und der Name des
     Sterns heißt Demut – Nahaufnahmen aus Tschernobyl“ sind mehrere
     längere Reisen in die Ukraine geplant. Ich beabsichtige, nicht nur mit den
     von der Tschernobyl-Katastrophe betroffenen Menschen zu sprechen und sie
     zu fotografieren, ich möchte, um Ergebnisse von höchster Authentizität zu
     erzielen, über einen Zeitraum von mehreren Wochen am Leben dieser Menschen
     teilhaben und sie in ihrem Alltag begleiten.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Neben
     den Reisekosten entstehen auch Kosten für Unterkunft, für erforderliche
     Dokumente sowie für ortskundige Fahrer und Übersetzer. Ich bin des
     Russischen zwar insoweit mächtig, dass ich mich einigermaßen verständigen
     und mitteilen kann; da ich aber auch die leisen Töne und feinen Nuancen
     zwischen den Zeilen meiner Gesprächs- und Interviewpartner einfangen
     möchte, ist professionelle Hilfe unerlässlich. Sämtliche Gespräche werden
     aufgezeichnet, verschriftlicht und anschließend präzise übersetzt.
     Vergessen darf man auch nicht die am Ende entstehenden Satzkosten – aus
     meinen Fotos und Texten soll nicht nur ein berührendes und
     eindrucksvolles, sondern auch ein optisch ansprechendes Buch entstehen.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Darüber
     hinaus wird nicht nur Geld für Dienstleistungen benötigt: Meine
     Kameraausrüstung muss für dieses Projekt um einige Komponenten erweitert
     und aufgewertet werden, und so klischeehaft es auch klingen mag: Ich
     brauche auf Reisen einen eigenen, zuverlässigen Geigerzähler und eine
     Extraportion Pralinen und Wodka, die mir Türen zu Orten öffnet, an die man
     nur mit Pralinen und Wodka gelangt. Schlussendlich will ich die Familien
     und Kinder in den Zonen 2 und 3 auch nicht mit leeren Händen besuchen –
     Schokolade bringe ich nie mit, wohl aber Schreibhefte und Dinge, die in
     den Dörfern nicht erhältlich sind (z.B. Webcams). </li></ul>
<ul><li>Wenn
     einer eine Reise tut, dann kann er was erzählen: Es ist mir ein Anliegen,
     anderen Menschen von meinen Erlebnissen zu berichten, meine Erfahrungen zu
     teilen und meine Eindrücke zu schildern. Ob dies mittels meiner
     Info-Dossiers, im kleinen Rahmen zuhause mit Laptop und Beamer oder im
     Kontext eines Vortrags vor größerem Publikum passiert, macht für mich
     keinen Unterschied. Ich möchte vor allem eines: Menschen erreichen. Wie
     der Text zu dieser Kampagne eindrucksvoll demonstriert, ist das Thema sehr
     umfangreich – umfangreich soll auch das Buch werden, für das ich mit
     250-300 Seiten und einem Format von mindestens 30cm x 30cm rechne und das
     im April 2016 veröffentlicht werden soll.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Wenn
     ich von meiner „Kampagne“ oder meinem „Projekt“ spreche, meine ich damit
     mehrere Einzelkampagnen, die ich ca. einen Monat vor den anstehenden
     Reisen starten werde – die aktuell laufende Kampagne unterstützt immer
     meinen nächsten Aufenthalt in der Ukraine. Ich werde mindestens dreimal,
     wahrscheinlich aber fünfmal vor Ort sein. Auf diese Weise möchte ich
     Vertrauen schaffen und meinen Unterstützern und Unterstützerinnen die
     Möglichkeit geben, mich auf die Probe zu stellen: Sie können sich erst
     mittels der Info-Dossiers von der Qualität meiner Fotos und Texte
     überzeugen, bevor sie sich dazu entscheiden, mich durch den Kauf eines
     anderen Perks oder den Erwerb des Buches zu unterstützen.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Sollte
     meine Kampagne nicht das gesteckte Ziel erreichen, werde ich das Projekt
     trotzdem realisieren und irgendwie aus eigenen Mitteln zu finanzieren
     versuchen. Ich bin von seiner Wichtigkeit überzeugt und weiß um die Dinge,

<p><b>Warum „Und der Name des Sterns heißt
Demut – Nahaufnahmen aus Tschernobyl"" </b><b>so wichtig ist</b></p>
<ul><li>Atomkraft
     ist ein riskantes Spiel mit dem Feuer, ein Spiel mit dem Tod – dieses
     Spiel kann man nur verlieren. Die Menschen, die nach der Explosion von
     Reaktor 4 als erste vor Ort waren und dabei geholfen haben, das Feuer zu
     löschen oder Trümmer zu beseitigen, sind größtenteils innerhalb von 72
     Stunden gestorben. Wenn man die Sperrzone heute, fast 30 Jahren nach dem
     Unfall, bereist, darf man in ihr nicht rauchen, nicht essen und nicht
     trinken – die Gefahr der Aufnahme radioaktiver Partikel ist zu groß. Man darf
     sich nirgendwo hinsetzen, Taschen nicht auf dem Boden abstellen und muss
     vermeiden, mit Staub in Berührung zu kommen, der im Sommer von
     vorbeifahrenden Fahrzeugen oder dem Wind aufgewirbelt wird und von
     Türrahmen rieseln könnte. Die Rückkehrerinnen in der als für immer
     unbewohnbar geltenden Sperrzone sowie die Familien in den Dörfern der Zonen
     2 und 3 sind Selbstversorger – sie ernähren sich von Obst und Gemüse, das
     auf kontaminiertem Boden wächst, von Tieren, die verseuchtes Futter
     fressen, von ihrer Milch, ihrem Fleisch und ihren Eiern. Es werden
     auffällig viele behinderte Kinder geboren, unter Jugendlichen ist
     Schilddrüsenkrebs weit verbreitet, die Anzahl der Krebserkrankungen unter
     Erwachsenen ist enorm. Um zu verstehen, das dort vor sich geht, und zu
     erahnen, wie es ist, dort zu leben, muss man es gesehen haben.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Deutschland
     mag zwar nach Fukushima der Kernenergie den Rücken gekehrt haben, ist aber
     von Ländern umgeben, in denen es auch weiterhin Atomkraftwerke gibt. Die
     Frage nach dem Umgang mit ihren Abfällen, deren Transport und ihrer
     Endlagerung kann nur lückenhaft beantwortet werden. In einigen Regionen
     des 1986 bundesweit vom radioaktiven Fallout Tschernobyls am schlimmsten
     betroffenen Freistaates Bayern sind Pilze und Wildschweine noch immer radioaktiv.
     Es ist unvorstellbar, was mit uns geschehen würde, wenn sich in einem
     unserer Nachbarländer ein atomarer Unfall ereignete – doch auch in
     Tschernobyl, das weniger als 2.000 Kilometer von Frankfurt am Main
     entfernt liegt, ist mit dem sich seit 2012 im Bau befindlichen neuen
     Sarkophag die Gefahr nicht gebannt. Durch Projekte wie dieses werden die
     Folgen des weltweit schwersten Unfalls in einem Kernkraftwerk 30 Jahre
     später veranschaulicht und erlebbar, spürbar und nachvollziehbar gemacht.

<ul><li>Im
     Osten der Ukraine herrscht Krieg. Von diesem Krieg bekommt man in Kiew und
     im Westen des Landes nur sehr wenig zu spüren, das Leben verläuft nach den
     Ausschreitungen auf dem Maidan wieder in einigermaßen geordneten Bahnen.
     Trotzdem weiß niemand, was morgen passiert – die Menschen sind vorsichtig
     und unsicher geworden, sie wollen sich auf nichts festlegen, keine
     Verbindlichkeiten eingehen. Es ist schwer geworden, Pläne zu schmieden,
     Termine zu machen oder Sicherheit und Zuverlässigkeit zu verlangen. Die
     meisten meiner Kontakte wollen erst wenige Tage vor anvisierten Treffen
     angeschrieben oder angerufen werden, was mir ein Höchstmaß an Flexibilität

<ul><li>Die
     Menschen in der Ukraine sind sehr gastfreundlich – und stellen einem Gast
     in der Regel alles auf den Tisch, was sie im Haus haben und anbieten
     können. Verständlich, dass es einer Beleidigung gleichkommt, wenn man ihre
     Gastfreundschaft ablehnt. Wie ich mich verhalten werde, wenn man mir in
     der Sperrzone oder in den Zonen 2 und 3 angebautes Obst und Gemüse oder
     selbst gebrannten Wodka anbietet, weiß ich nicht. Auch bedarf die
     Beantwortung der Frage danach, wie ich mich ernähre, wenn ich mich für
     längere Zeit in den verseuchten Gebieten aufhalte, sowohl sorgfältiger
     Planung als auch einer gewissen Risikobereitschaft. Ich denke, dass ich
     mich für eine Mischung aus Vorsicht, faulen Ausreden und journalistischem

<ul><li>Da sich
     der Tag des GAUs von Tschernobyl am 26.04.2016 zum 30. Mal jährt, ist mit
     fotografischen und journalistischen Mitbewerbern zu rechnen – schon jetzt
     sind im Internet diverse Fotografen vertreten, die marktschreierisch und
     mit immer extremeren Fotos ihre Tschernobyl-Projekte anpreisen. Ich freue
     mich deshalb über den Sonderstatus und den zutiefst menschlichen
     Blickwinkel, den mein Projekt einnimmt, denn er grenzt meine Arbeit
     deutlich von der Arbeit anderer ab. In die Ukraine fliegen, Dollarscheine auf
     den Tisch legen, einen kontaminierten, leerstehenden Plattenbau fotografieren
     und am Computer den Kontrast erhöhen – das kann jeder. Die Bereitschaft,
     sich menschlichen Tragödien zu stellen, sich in die Erzählenden hinein zu fühlen
     und sie im richtigen Augenblick abzulichten, bringen nur wenige mit. Viele
     suchen die Sensation und nicht den Menschen, sie zeigen kein wirkliches
     Interesse an ihren Gesprächspartnern. Ich bringe die für dieses Projekt
     notwendige Bereitschaft, das Interesse und fotografische Leidenschaft mit.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1098460/files/20141215140055-IMG_3709.JPG?1418680855"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b></b></p><p><b>Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann</b></p>

     mich für eine Mischung aus Vorsicht, faulen Ausreden und journalistischem
     Wahnsinn entscheiden werde – in täglich unterschiedlichen Mischverhältnissen.
Da sich
     der Tag des GAUs von Tschernobyl am 26.04.2016 zum 30. Mal jährt, ist mit
     fotografischen und journalistischen Mitbewerbern zu rechnen – schon jetzt
     sind im Internet diverse Fotografen vertreten, die marktschreierisch und
     mit immer extremeren Fotos ihre Tschernobyl-Projekte anpreisen. Ich freue
     mich deshalb über den Sonderstatus und den zutiefst menschlichen
     Blickwinkel, den mein Projekt einnimmt, denn er grenzt meine Arbeit
     deutlich von der Arbeit anderer ab. In die Ukraine fliegen, Dollarscheine auf
     den Tisch legen, einen kontaminierten, leerstehenden Plattenbau fotografieren
     und am Computer den Kontrast erhöhen – das kann jeder. Die Bereitschaft,
     sich menschlichen Tragödien zu stellen, sich in die Erzählenden hinein zu fühlen
     und sie im richtigen Augenblick abzulichten, bringen nur wenige mit. Viele
     suchen die Sensation und nicht den Menschen, sie zeigen kein wirkliches
     Interesse an ihren Gesprächspartnern. Ich bringe die für dieses Projekt
     notwendige Bereitschaft, das Interesse und fotografische Leidenschaft mit.Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann

If you don't know already, there are two salient characteristics about my life: (1) I'm broke and (2) I love taking pictures.

<br/><br/>I just ""bought"" a new camera. 

It's the Canon 6D. It's about as a good of a camera you can get, and I'm in love with it. Only problem is, I can't really afford it.
<br/><br/>
I bought my new camera on credit, and I'm kindly asking you guys to help me pay it off on time. In return, and in my way of thanking you, I will take your picture with it!

<br/><br/>What it really comes down to is I (finally) decided to not let my financial situation keep me from doing what I love. After eight years of taking pictures, I came to the conclusion that a new camera is what will help me expand the scope of my photography.
<br/><br/>
<b>The Packages<br/></b>
If you have ever wanted me to take your picture, NOW IS THE TIME! Not only do I have an amazing new camera to do so, but I am also slashing my prices to 1/3-1/4 of what I usually charge! Please take a look at the various packages I have come up with.<br/><br/>
<b>Other Ways You Can Help</b>

<h3>Why WiCAM?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Some days it feels like our world isn't as safe as it used to be. People get robbed on the street, burglar sneaks into our house from the back yard, or bikers get hit by the car behind them. What if we had an extra eye to watch our back knowing if we're being followed by someone on the street, or watch the bad drivers from the back of my bike? What if we could see who’s in the backyard or front door without showing ourselves?</p>
<p>Yes, we can solve them with a camera! But, the cameras we have are either huge or wired which makes them impossible to carry. Or they are power hungry and we have to charge battery multiple times each day. Eventually they became expensive high tech toys sitting inside the drawer.</p>
<p>We need something better! It has to be wireless and super small, easy to carry and can be installed anywhere. And it has to be super low power so that a single charge can run for a long time. That’s why we created WiCam.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9_QCtXa7TWw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9_QCtXa7TWw%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9_QCtXa7TWw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>History</h3> <p></p>We started work on WiCam in July 2015 and demonstrated the first working prototype at Maker Faire New York in September 2015. The reaction was nothing less than astounding. We met folks who want to use WiCam on their drone, inspired robot builders, and a bodyguard who was excited about wearable surveillance. Perhaps what inspired us most was kids' reaction who had some of the most imaginative ideas about what they do with WiCam. Everyone that has seen the prototype has asked when and where they can buy it. After month's of hard work, we're set to move from prototype to commercial availability. </div><div>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>A Tiny Coin Sized WiFi and Bluetooth camera that You Can Install Anywhere!</h3> <p></p>WiCam is different from other cameras. It was designed from the ground up to be tiny, use little power and be completely self-contained. Not much larger than a coin, you can put WiCam in your pocket and take it wherever you go!  </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460401206/1_ao2f8r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Power Hungry?</h3>It sucks when your camera went out of juice. Compared to regular cameras, WiCam consumes only 5% of the power used by a regular camera. That means it's not the usual camera you know or have. Super low power empowers WiCam with worry-free magic. Attach it and use it. Forget about wires, forget about daily charging.<br/>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460401302/1_eydrko.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Wide angle, larger view</h3>
<p>WiCAM uses a 120 degree wide angle lens. You can attach WiCAM to the back of a bike and use it as a rear-view camera. WiCAM catches what you can’t see behind you and redisplays it on your smartphone.</p>
<p>Now you are assured that drivers behind you will do the right things when they know they’re being watched.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460404356/1_ajol7j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>WiCam is born to be wild!  </h3>
<p>WiCam is not like a usual security camera that has to stay at home and connected to your router. WiCam is meant to be wild! You can connect to WiCam directly from your smartphone at any place. WiCam expands your vision and help you see what you can't see remotely.</p>
<p>WiCAM is ideal for replacing some of the security cameras - especially for yards, landscapes, farmlands and camping sites. Its battery can last for months and has a maximum of 30 meters distance wireless coverage in open areas.</p>

</div><div> <p> </p>After the last 8 months of soldering, coding, hacking and iteration, WiCam is developed and in its finalize stages of refinement. Technical risks are very low at this stage since the hardware has been extensively tested and the software is nearly complete.

Why WiCAM? 
Some days it feels like our world isn't as safe as it used to be. People get robbed on the street, burglar sneaks into our house from the back yard, or bikers get hit by the car behind them. What if we had an extra eye to watch our back knowing if we're being followed by someone on the street, or watch the bad drivers from the back of my bike? What if we could see who’s in the backyard or front door without showing ourselves?
Yes, we can solve them with a camera! But, the cameras we have are either huge or wired which makes them impossible to carry. Or they are power hungry and we have to charge battery multiple times each day. Eventually they became expensive high tech toys sitting inside the drawer.
We need something better! It has to be wireless and super small, easy to carry and can be installed anywhere. And it has to be super low power so that a single charge can run for a long time. That’s why we created WiCam.

   History We started work on WiCam in July 2015 and demonstrated the first working prototype at Maker Faire New York in September 2015. The reaction was nothing less than astounding. We met folks who want to use WiCam on their drone, inspired robot builders, and a bodyguard who was excited about wearable surveillance. Perhaps what inspired us most was kids' reaction who had some of the most imaginative ideas about what they do with WiCam. Everyone that has seen the prototype has asked when and where they can buy it. After month's of hard work, we're set to move from prototype to commercial availability. 


  A Tiny Coin Sized WiFi and Bluetooth camera that You Can Install Anywhere! WiCam is different from other cameras. It was designed from the ground up to be tiny, use little power and be completely self-contained. Not much larger than a coin, you can put WiCam in your pocket and take it wherever you go!  



Power Hungry?It sucks when your camera went out of juice. Compared to regular cameras, WiCam consumes only 5% of the power used by a regular camera. That means it's not the usual camera you know or have. Super low power empowers WiCam with worry-free magic. Attach it and use it. Forget about wires, forget about daily charging.




Wide angle, larger view
WiCAM uses a 120 degree wide angle lens. You can attach WiCAM to the back of a bike and use it as a rear-view camera. WiCAM catches what you can’t see behind you and redisplays it on your smartphone.
Now you are assured that drivers behind you will do the right things when they know they’re being watched.  



WiCam is born to be wild!  
WiCam is not like a usual security camera that has to stay at home and connected to your router. WiCam is meant to be wild! You can connect to WiCam directly from your smartphone at any place. WiCam expands your vision and help you see what you can't see remotely.
WiCAM is ideal for replacing some of the security cameras - especially for yards, landscapes, farmlands and camping sites. Its battery can last for months and has a maximum of 30 meters distance wireless coverage in open areas.




You could also use WiCam outside the camping tent and watch the bear walking outside your tent from the WiCam, safely.





Wireless Camera on carsWiCam can also be used on cars and watch any blind spots from your smartphone. WiCam streams video wirelessly to your smartphone without wiring in the front or back of your car.





Open Source, designed with Makers in mind!
WiCam is a state-of-the-art wireless video camera supporting Wifi and Bluetooth technology. With a rich API designed for Makers, this camera can quickly be integrated into almost any project.
WiCAM is made with makers in mind. It’s fully open documents and SDK could help you easily integrate WiCam into a Drone, a Robot, and many more.
WiCAM has a built in temperature sensor for smart home temperature monitoring! It also has an I2S audio interface allow you to incorporate wireless audio!

Risks & Challenges
  After the last 8 months of soldering, coding, hacking and iteration, WiCam is developed and in its finalize stages of refinement. Technical risks are very low at this stage since the hardware has been extensively tested and the software is nearly complete. With the technical challenges behind us, we are facing the challenge to bring WiCam into the hands of everyone. The only major risk that we are facing is to get the production volumes up in order to get the price down and that's why we are here for crowdfunding. We have established fantastic working relationships with component suppliers, PCBA and tooling factories to bring you the highest quality coin cam on time. However, unforeseen events such as other players on the market may purchase the same components in large volumes just the time before us. Getting the product in time to you is always one of our first priorities, and we keep close relationships with our component suppliers to make sure those critical components are buffered and reserved for our Kickstarter backers.

It is also capable of operating in unknown and GPS-denied environments such as in houses, caves, tunnels or any other places where no accurate GPS signal is available, since it's not dependent on an external device or signal.

 LeveTop T1S can be used in many scenes. Such as entertainment, extreme sports, commencement, and touring. You can always rely on T1S while shooting a qualified video or taking a photo.  LeveTop's superior foldable design makes it convenient to carry. It can be taken everywhere and fits into your bag. No more hassle of carrying around a drone when you are not using it. 2x switchable cameras equipped! The main camera of LeveTop is equipped with SONY IMX179 1/3.2"" Sensor, 4G lens, it delivers smooth 1080P Full-HD video with stunning image quality.The second camera is at the bottom of the drone, so you can get different angles with it. All these features ensure you the best filming experience. Go for a run worry free while LeveTop Auto-Follows you. Simply download the App to your iOS or Android device, and control it at the click of a button. GPS tracking means it will stay with you no matter where you go. The App control system removes the awkwardness of traditional piloting remote.The battery life of LeveTop T1S is up to 20 minutes, which is longer than the average battery life of the drones in the market.Brushless motors inside the drone: Many portable drones use DC motors to lower the cost. DC motors have a short battery life (basically within ten minutes). The wind resistance is weak since the speed of drones powered by DC motor is low. But with LeveTop's brushless motors, the flying speed is the next level, so that the wind resistance is excellent. There is almost no limit to the service life (5,000 to 10,000 hours). DJI is undoubtedly the leader of the drone industry. However, the cost of a single product of DJI is quite high. LeveTop is more cost-effective compared with any other drone in the market, which makes it a perfect choice if you need a drone to record your precious moments.The Levetop T1S is smaller and lighter than the first generation. What's more, T1S provides two cameras, including a 1080 Full-HD camera and the other one at the bottom of the drone. It will give you a brand new photography experience with the two cameras of different angles. The switchable cameras of LeveTop allow you to capture selfie shots from a unique perspective. Taking pictures and videos is easy for anyone with the programmed flight modes. Great for newbie pilots who want to focus on getting that perfect selfie rather than worry about positioning the drone.The Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to share your photos and videos instantly.   We have designed an early warning indicator when there are less than 3 minutes of remaining battery life. LeveTop will return safely when the GPS connection is lost, as its onboard computer stores the GPS coordinates where it took off. What's more, experiments showed that the aircraft fell unharmed from a height of ten meters. There are four propeller protectors equipped with LeveTop. The design reduces the probability of accidental injury by the drone. In the meanwhile, it's also a kind of protection for the drone itself. The signal of remote control of T1 is 2.4G . There are two versions of T1S, 2.4G/5.8G. The transmission distance of the 2.4G version is around 100m. The 5.8G version has a more stable transmission and the transmission distance up to 500m. It's worth mentioning that the 5.8G version can even fly up to 300 meters. For applications in urban environments where tall buildings may obstruct a portion of the sky, we recommend the solution that works with both GPS and GLONASS satellites.If you rely on only one constellation, there may not be 4 satellites visible in such a small slice of the sky, making it difficult to get a position fixing. When you add a second constellation, you double your chances of getting a fixing in this environment.There are eight parts in the box, including 1x T1S drone, 1x Battery, 4x Propeller Guard(1 set), 1x Propeller(Backup), 1x Charger, 1x USB Cable, 1x Carrying Case, and 1x Quick Start Guide. LeveTop was founded by a group of talented engineers and designers based in Shenzhen, China. Their mission is to create drones that are simple to use and affordable. By perfecting the combination of portability and function, we are proud to bring LeveTop into your life.LeveTop's first drone was officially launched in November 2017 on Kickstarter, which successfully raised US$ 254,000 US dollars and got 2,201 backers worldwide. We've also got several patents in LeveTop T1S design, flight control, rotor system, and battery circuit.",50.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p>A one-handed single twist unlocks and locks Steadify’s monopod elements to its desired length. The fork-shaped mount on top is designed to reliably accommodate any device, letting it pan and tilt in all desired directions. The effect is instantly tangible and a truly stunning experience. Further, Steadify will handle the weight of your device so you can hold it for hours without tiring. The comfortable baseplate completely absorbs the weight of your gear. This is good news for wildlife photographers and filmmakers, for bird watchers, and hunters.</p>
<p>Steadify also functions as a jib arm for smooth vertical and horizontal camera movements, a bonus usually found in more lavish equipment. For cameramen, this feature adds life and dynamic to footage that can make a scene stand out.</p>

<h1>
<i>STEADIFY</i> IS DESIGNED FOR:</h1>
<ul>
<li>PHOTOGRAPHY: stable support for cameras, essential with long lenses and in low light. Working well on any terrain. The effect: crisp images regardless of the circumstances. Applications: outdoors, documentaries, events from concerts to weddings, shots from ships and planes, and much more.</li>
<li>FILMING: as above, additionally functioning as a jibarm for dynamic vertical and horizontal camera movements. The effect: professionally smooth, lively footage. (Please keep in mind that walking while filming will de-stabilize your images - <i>Steadify</i> is not a SteadiCam.)</li>
<li>ACTION: keeping action cams, compact cams, and smartphone cams closely attached to the body.</li>
<li>BIRD-WATCHING: comforting support for binoculars and scopes. The effect: absolutely clear and stable viewing, especially effective with long lenses and in low light. Weight is totally absorbed, offering endless viewing without fatigue. Do your arms feel relieved already reading this?</li>
<li>HUNTING: reliable support for tireless and safe aiming.</li>
</ul>

A one-handed single twist unlocks and locks Steadify’s monopod elements to its desired length. The fork-shaped mount on top is designed to reliably accommodate any device, letting it pan and tilt in all desired directions. The effect is instantly tangible and a truly stunning experience. Further, Steadify will handle the weight of your device so you can hold it for hours without tiring. The comfortable baseplate completely absorbs the weight of your gear. This is good news for wildlife photographers and filmmakers, for bird watchers, and hunters.
Steadify also functions as a jib arm for smooth vertical and horizontal camera movements, a bonus usually found in more lavish equipment. For cameramen, this feature adds life and dynamic to footage that can make a scene stand out.




 


 
 

 
 
 
 
 


STEADIFY IS DESIGNED FOR:

PHOTOGRAPHY: stable support for cameras, essential with long lenses and in low light. Working well on any terrain. The effect: crisp images regardless of the circumstances. Applications: outdoors, documentaries, events from concerts to weddings, shots from ships and planes, and much more.
FILMING: as above, additionally functioning as a jibarm for dynamic vertical and horizontal camera movements. The effect: professionally smooth, lively footage. (Please keep in mind that walking while filming will de-stabilize your images - Steadify is not a SteadiCam.)
ACTION: keeping action cams, compact cams, and smartphone cams closely attached to the body.
BIRD-WATCHING: comforting support for binoculars and scopes. The effect: absolutely clear and stable viewing, especially effective with long lenses and in low light. Weight is totally absorbed, offering endless viewing without fatigue. Do your arms feel relieved already reading this?
HUNTING: reliable support for tireless and safe aiming.

<p><i><b>The
Dawn of a Passion</b></i></p>
<p>Hello.
I am a passionate and aspiring photographer. I discovered photographer during
medical school while studying for my board exam. I was using my left-brain too
much for logic, and my right-brain for creativity was screaming to come out.
Although my doctoral career did not pan out, I realized that I am very good at
photography and have an eye for it. I started out shooting for my newborn baby
niece. Then I went on to shoot for events for nonprofits and startup companies.
Then my friends from church used me for their weddings. Nowadays, complete
strangers contact me to shoot their weddings!</p>
<p><i><b>The Motivation for this Funding</b></i></p>
<p>I have a wedding to shoot in October.
This wedding is special because it is the first wedding from a complete
stranger who contacted me from my website. This soon to be bride was referred
to me from a videographer that I have worked with and from a friend that she
was a bridesmaid to. I feel honored to be referred and to be contacted like
this, and so I want to do the best job I can possibly do. I will go all out and
work 12 hours that day and think about creative ways to make her wedding
special. Because she trusts me, I want to deliver a good product to build a
lasting relationship. My current camera has limitations and I have outgrown it.
To make her wedding as memorable as I can, it starts with a one step upgrade to
a fully professional camera.</p>
<p><i><b>The
Current Predicament</b></i></p>
<p>The
camera I have been using is the Nikon D5000. However, it is not a professional
level camera. Some potential clients turned me down because of my camera. I
wish to take one step up from my current camera and upgrade to the Nikon D7100,
which is $1100 on Amazon. If I reach $800, I can buy a used one on Ebay. I believe this camera has the full functions I need
and the appearance for clients to respect me. Although my work speaks for
itself, I believe a better camera can take my passion to a whole new level. </p><b>
</b><p><i><b>The
Perks for You</b></i></p>
<p>If you donate, I would forever be in
your debt. A new camera might exercise my right-brain even more. It might pave
a way to more clients and more adventures. A perk for you would be a free photo
session of your choice. Whether it is an engagement, wedding, family, or event
session, I will gladly do a one-day shoot for you for free. </p>
<p><b><i>The Passion Full Circled</i></b></p>
<p>Sometimes, work does not feel like work
when you’re doing something you love. I can shoot all day without feeling tired
at all, as my clients can attest to. Oftentimes, I shoot until they are tired,
but the result is something they are pleased with. I cannot afford this camera
right now because I am paying back medical student loans, but this passion
might help me pay back loans sooner. </p>
<p>In all honesty, I am thankful that you
have read this far my story. I wish to develop this passion but the fact that
you’ve read this far is very much appreciated. Any amount would be helpful but
feel free to share my story and visit my webpage at <a href=""http://www.duyphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.duyphotography.com</a>.

<h3>Catherine's Story</h3>
<p>I love to take photos of dogs in action. They can be our own, or those we meet while out at the dog beach or other favorite places. One day while we were out, I offered to email some pics to two ladies we met out with their dogs. The feedback was very positive, and when we met out walking again one lady mentioned that she would like to get prints of some of the pics I'd taken. Unfortunately, these type of action shots often have to be zoomed from a distance and the camera I have doesn't have a high enough resolution for printing of a decent size.</p>
<p>Recently I've been laid of from work and am looking to make a change in direction for my career. The career is not photography but actually alternative health, and I would need some other source of income to help me during training and starting up a business. What better than something I absolutely enjoy!!</p>
<p>To this end, I'm asking for a small contribution in support of this goal to kick start a new life purpose.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Sharing the Joy<br/>
</h3>
<p>The ability to take high resolution photos will benefit not only my family, but provide enjoyment for others for years to come.</p>
<p>For dog owners there is very little more uplifting than watching their dogs have fun off leash... with the wind in their fur and their paws splashing in puddles. However, capturing these moments can be trickier than you might think and I seem to have developed a knack for it.</p>
<p>Besides being a joy for me to do, it's also of value to others in that they can keep those treasured moments of their pets lives for ever.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Wished for Items and Thank-You's<br/>
</h3>
<p>I'm looking to purchase a camera like the one shown below. My current equipment is not a digital SLR and doesn't provide the fine detail required for printing (even though the results look fine on the screen). Also I'd like to purchase a tripod and some other small accessories (e.g. filters).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you are kind enough to help me reach my goal, then I will give you a mention on my website (unless you wish to remain anonymous). If you contribute $20 then I will provide you with a 8""x10"" print from a high resolution photo in my collection if my goal is reached. For a contribution of $100 take photos of your own dog in action and you can choose three prints from the session (or choose three prints from the collection).<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For the past 13 years I have been shooting photos of the changes in the landscape during spring/summer and winter. During the Ice Storm in 2013 I did what I would naturally do and took some shots of the landscape under ice cover. </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>I was sharing my picks with a friend who is always encouraging me to sell my photos and he suggested I make a calendar with some of my photos.  The idea did not take much prodding as I love graphic designing. So I went through my ice photos and came up with the best ones and started designing a calendar.</li>
<li>Another friend told me about INDIEGOGO and how I could get the funds needed to make my dream a reality.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>About The Project:</b></h1>
<div>This project is important to me as it will help to establish me in the graphic design community and give my grandchildren a token of my accomplishment.</div>
<div>The project is a 14 month 2015 calendar featuring the photos from the ice storm. Some with photos of the same objects during the other seasons.</div>
<div>Along with the photos there will be little stories about where it was taken and the person who took them if I use photos taken by others.<br/>
</div>
<div>With successful funding the calendar will be distributed from November 24,  to December 8, 2014.  My goal is to print and distribute 5,000 calendars.</div>
<div>With a great project idea and the material to get it under way I <span style=""background-color: initial;"">did my homework:</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">    *  I checked the crowd-funding platform and realized it might just work for my                 very imaginative project.</span></div>
<div>

</div></div>","About The Producer:


Hi, my name is Mauseia Mc Taggart a semi-retired grandmother from Scarborough, Ontario, Canada where I run my small business doing bookkeeping, income tax preparation and little graphic designs.

For the past 13 years I have been shooting photos of the changes in the landscape during spring/summer and winter. During the Ice Storm in 2013 I did what I would naturally do and took some shots of the landscape under ice cover. 

I was sharing my picks with a friend who is always encouraging me to sell my photos and he suggested I make a calendar with some of my photos.  The idea did not take much prodding as I love graphic designing. So I went through my ice photos and came up with the best ones and started designing a calendar.
Another friend told me about INDIEGOGO and how I could get the funds needed to make my dream a reality.

About The Project:
This project is important to me as it will help to establish me in the graphic design community and give my grandchildren a token of my accomplishment.
The project is a 14 month 2015 calendar featuring the photos from the ice storm. Some with photos of the same objects during the other seasons.
Along with the photos there will be little stories about where it was taken and the person who took them if I use photos taken by others.

With successful funding the calendar will be distributed from November 24,  to December 8, 2014.  My goal is to print and distribute 5,000 calendars.
With a great project idea and the material to get it under way I did my homework:

    *  I checked the crowd-funding platform and realized it might just work for my                 very imaginative project.

    *  Ask friends, family and acquaintances to contribute by submitting their ice                    storm photos which they will get credit for and support the crowd-funding                    campaign by backing it and spreading the news. 


     *  I checked the cost of printing for a project this size and found a great printing              company lined up with a favorably price. 


     *  I checked the price of packaging material and mailing costs.


     *  I then worked out the cost of everything from beginning to end and worked out          the best rewards for the backers.

Here are 4 sample pages of what to expect in the calendar hope you enjoy them.

 And idea of the front and back cover

 Idea of $75.00 reward Ad

 Idea of $100.00 Reward Ad

 Idea of $150.00 Reward Ad

 Idea of $250.00 reward ad
How can you help?
Every great project requires funding and am turning to you to assist me in funding my project.  I have worked out very reasonable packages for my backers and give my personal guarantee that you will receive your rewards and you will not be disappointed in backing this project.

Become a backer.  Check out the packages chose the one that fits you sign up and we are on our way.
Share the news with friends and family encourage them to support the project and get the rewards.

By doing so you will assist in sharing a great calendar with our community if we reach our goal these beautiful calendars will be on their way to a minimum of 5,000 happy recipients.
What We Need & What You Get
 
To achieve my goal I requires C$5,000.00. 80% of which will go to printing the balance to packaging and postage.  I am devoting my time free of cost as the end result are more valuable to me than cash.

As a backer you will be able to share this unique calendar with your friends and family as your reward will be copies of the calendar and your name in the thank you section in the calendar where everyone receiving the calendar will be able to recognize your generosity!
 If I do not achieve my $5,000.00 goal all funds received will go to printing the quantity of calendars it can and all backers will get their rewards. 
  The Impact I realize that there are a lot of calendars out there which might cost less than backing this one but this is not just a calendar to me it is a piece of Toronto weather history that can be passed on as a keepsake to your grandchildren as I  will be doing for mine.
I also realize that you do not know me and has no reason to trust me but there is a first time for everyone and everything and this is my first Indiegogo project and experience and I promise to go through projects and fund wherever I can not just looking for help willing to give back to the community. 
I look forward to growing with the Indiegogo family with my future projects.
  Risks & Challenges  The biggest risk to this project is delays!! Graphic design if I get sick and unable to complete it so I have enlisted back up just in case I need them. 
Printing if I do not get it there on time for the deadline, again back up help to ensure it gets there on time. 
The printer! I have chosen a experienced qualified printing company to do the job and they have given me a written guarantee if it get there on time they deliver it on time.
Other Ways You Can Help
 I realize that not everyone can financially support my project but to me it is the thought that counts so if you are one of those please support my project by passing the word around to your social media friends and relatives.
Thanks in advance for all your support.
