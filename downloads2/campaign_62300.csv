Her case specifically is dealing with abnormal bone growth behind her eye causing pressure to her nerves in her eye. Over the past few years it has caused one eye to grow out a little farther than the other and her eyesight has become progressively worse. If not treated soon she could lose vision in that eye as well as her hearing on that side of her head. She will be getting surgery soon but due to the rarity of this procedure and the delicate nature of the procedure the surgery will be quite expensive and risky. We are praying that everything will go well. In addition she will also have to have plastic surgery after the procedure to get her face looking the same again. With me going to college and having two other younger siblings, this is a lot to handle for my mom and stepdad. It's even worse because we never understood what was happening to her. We thought she just couldn't see well and glasses would help her. And that her eyes were just a bit uneven. My little sister is the best sister anyone could ask for. I want very much to help her so she can live a normal, happy life. Please donate, even the smallest amounts help! I will be posting more and posting pictures of when she goes into surgery. In the very least, please keep her in your prayers.<p></p>

<h3>Gail, the Ultimate Fighter</h3>
<p>My aunt Gail has put her boxing gloves back on for another time to continue her fight that began over 8 years ago with Ovarian Cancer. As an active member of her church, local community and online community of those also affected by Ovarian Cancer, Gail has shown great strength and bravery, and has used her experiences to give support back to others.</p>
<p>Her fight takes her to Houston, TX, where at MD Anderson Cancer Center she has begun a new clinical trial. Her treatment requires her to travel from Murray, KY twice a month. This involves driving 2 hours to Nashville and taking a plane to Houston. </p>

Work Completed To Date
The Lazarus Health Project is entering Phase 2 of its mandate to create an interactive, entertaining, online video-based education tool for all age groups, that will be free of charge.
Phase 1 involved putting the basic hardware in place, such as production equipment and postproduction software.

We created a simple yet useful wordpress website with more than a dozen edited video shorts, and we have been building relationships with social change groups both locally and internationally.

Why This Matters
Reclaiming our right to vibrant health is more crucial than ever.  Chronic and degenerative illness rates are on the rise. More of us can expect to get cancer and other debilitating conditions than ever before. Most of this increase is due to degradation in our food supply (leading to a nutrient-deficient diet), poor lifestyle choices as well as increased exposure to pollutants and environmental toxins.
There is an overwhelming amount of health information online, much of it narrowly focused or slanted towards a particular regimen or prescribed set of rules to follow. In addition, most health resources seem to be promoting products, practitioners, or solutions for profit. We aim to remain bias-free, both financially and ideologically, to serve an eclectic community of health practitioners and health-seekers and to integrate various tested and credible sources of information. 
What's Next and How You Can Help
We are at a turning point! We are now ready to launch Phase 2, the official Lazarus Health Project web site, and need your help. This is an ambitious undertaking and reflects our vision of a comprehensive online resource that will guide users through an interactive health education experience. Our web site will be designed around 8 core principles of health.

We will create an overview clip on each of these areas. We have already completed Nourish Yourself , we have 7 more to go and are well on our way with several of them! In addition, we will be generating a host of other short-format clips to be posted under the 8 categories, but also cross-linked to the other clips. That is why we need your support! 
From Nuts-and-Bolts to The Bigger Vision
To make this vision a reality, we need the technological know-how of the best web designers and online programmers in the field. To translate the holism and relationship between all areas of health, we need an online platform that mirrors this interconnectedness. We plan to achieve this by incorporating the following features in the new web site:

interactivity such as clickable text overlays and thumbnails
related video hotspots and content 'flagging' options
customizable table of contents under each user profile
one-click sharing of videos on social media sites and mobile devices
membership-based updates and webinars
We will also link to other trusted sources and advocacy groups around the world. Your contribution will enable the launch of this tool for creating one's own health curriculum and sharing the information in an online community setting.
Your Contribution Helps Preserve Independent Media on Health and the Environment
To date, the Lazarus Health Project has depended entirely on individual private donors and is not affiliated with government, corporate, or institutional sources of funding. It does not generate revenue by promoting or selling health products or health-related information. It is truely a project by the people and for the people! Your contribution, big or small, promotes this model of citizen journalism as a platform for education and advocacy. 
Please help us spread the word! Watch this video which features both of us sharing why this project matters!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Jairus.  I am 34 years old and I am pleading for your<br/>help!!  I have been diagnosed with a Neuroendocrine<br/>Stage 4 cancer called Paraganglioma. It’s a rare cancer that I have been battling for the past 2 years and if I don’t receive a procedure right away, called PRRT, I will die.  This aggressive cancer has destroyed my kidney leaving me with only one kidney. It has destroyed parts of my spine leaving me with rods in my back,<br/>numbness in my legs, I can’t stand up straight and can barely walk.  I have undergone those major surgeries that almost took my life. There are spots of the tumor on my lungs which affects my speaking &amp; breathing, on my head and the tumor that was removed in my back has returned. I live day to day in horrific pain. <br/>I am on Morphine and Oxycodone along with many other medications. I have received many types of chemo, intravenously and orally that had me so sick that I thought I wasn’t going to make it.  None of which had worked.</p>
<p> I have two boys, who will be teenagers soon, who needs their father.  You don’t realize how just seeing their smiling faces is what keeps me going.  I can be in a lot of pain, but just seeing their faces or just knowing they are in the next room, just makes my day.  THEY are motivation for living.  Oh how I would love to be able to coach their football and basketball teams again. throw a football or shoot a basketball, attend their games and be able to sit through the entire games again. My son asked me, “Daddy are you going to die?”  “Are you going to leave us and never come back?” “Don’t leave us daddy” I told him that with God's help daddy is going to do everything that he can to live. And he gave me a big hug and the tears rolled down my face after he left the room. Young boys need their fathers to help them stay out of trouble these days.  They are already asking me questions that kids ask at their age. They have a wonderful mom but they feel more comfortable talking to their daddy about certain issues rather  than their mother.  I treasure those much needed talks.</p>
<p>My pain and limited functions don’t allow me to be the man that I need and want to be.  I wake up in tears, due to the pain all throughout my body, but I won’t let my kids see daddy wiping those tears away.  I have to be strong for them.  They can’t see me when I’m depressed, they can’t see me when I feel I am not going to make it. I don’t want them to see the fact that I need help walking, standing, sitting and going to the restroom.  <strong>I WANT TO LIVE.  I DON’T WANT TO DIE!!  I DON’T WANT TO DIE!!</strong></p>

<br/><h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>It is the world's first E-INK Ebook Reader and
Monitor 2in1 device. We call it <b><i>CBR</i></b>. After the campaign ending, we
will reveal what <b><i>CBR</i></b> stands for to our contributors.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to use a regular
E-INK ebook reader as a second computer monitor, displaying text or images that
are displayed on LCD/TV monitors onto the E-INK ebook reader device. It’s better
for the eyes and much more readable for the user.</p>

<h1>Advantages</h1>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>CBR is your eye-friendly E-INK companion.<br/>
</li>
<li>It is mobile. Take it with you. Read ebooks everywhere, at home, on
the beach…<br/>
</li>
<li>Connect it to your computer. Surf and work on it without getting eye strain.<br/>
</li>
<li>Great for people who don't really need color monitor, such as children,
students, programmers, scientists, office workers, etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>Great for working in sunlight. Try to read on a LCD/LED display such
as your smart phone in sunlight. You will notice the difference. E-INK panels
deliver clear, crisp text and images with no glare.<br/>
</li>
<li>Great for people with eye problems.<br/>
</li>
<li>Built-in light (for the advanced CBR) evenly illuminates the screen
to provide the perfect reading experience in all lighting conditions.<br/>
</li>
<li>Holds up to 1,100 books - take your library wherever you go.<br/>
</li>
<li>Built-in Wi-Fi lets you download books in few seconds.<br/>
</li>
<li>Supports comics formats: CBR and CBZ<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1>What is E-INK?</h1>
<h2>E-INK displays are great for your eyes</h2>
<p>The E-INK (also called electronic paper or
epaper) screen is easier on the eyes for reading documents and web pages. Its
displays are easier to read than backlight displays, because they mimic the
appearance of ink on paper. You will not experience eye strain after long time
reading.</p>
<p>E-INK enabled displays are easily readable
even in direct sunlight because E-INK displays reflect light like ordinary
paper.</p>
<h2>E-INK enabled displays are green</h2>
<p>If we could replace all paper newspapers
with eNewspapers tomorrow, it would save 95 million trees which could remove 98
million tons of greenhouse gas each year.</p>
<p>E-INK Displays save 60% energy vs. LCD/LED. There
are 6 billion electronic displays in mobile devices, computers and signage
worldwide consuming 2,300,000 Megawatt Hours.</p>
<h1>CBR Features:</h1>
<p><i>2 in 1 E-INK EBook Reader + E-INK Monitor</i></p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>As an E-INK ebook reader: Our CBR
features all functionalities of an ebook reader like reading ePUB, PDF, TXT,
FB2, HTML, etc books, watching images like JPG, BMP, and reading comics.</p>
<p>Just take it with
you.</p>

<h1>Why do we need your help?</h1>
<p>We need your support at Indiegogo to help us to
fund our first mass production and manufacturing run. That means making
thousands of these devices to ship around the world. We also need your help to
develop ebook reader monitors with bigger size display such as 9.7inch. You'll
be worldwide amongst the first to have one so you can tell your friends and the
whole world too. </p>
<p>If you cannot contribute the dollar, but you
are willing to help us to make some noise on facebook, twitter, google+ or any
other similar websites, we would also be very grateful for your help.</p>
<h1>What's Next?</h1>
<p>We’re now getting ready to start production of
our CBR but we need your help to accomplish that. With the support from
Indiegogo we'll be able to start our first manufacturing run and we hope
to start shipping them to you in November 2013. </p>
<p>The product contains an E-INK Ebook reader with
a USB cable and a microfiber protection bag in one box. </p>
<h1>The products you will get:</h1>
<p>The CBRs are available in two display types, E-INK
panel with and without light. </p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>The
standard device uses a 6inch E-INK pearl white panel without front light,
resolution: 800x600.</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>The
advanced device uses a 6inch E-INK pearl white HD panel with front light,
resolution: 1024x758. With the front light, you can even use it in the
darkness. (The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite uses such a panel with front light)</p>
<h1>About us:</h1>
<p>We are a small development team specialized
in the development of E-INK-based devices such as Ebook readers, price display,

We proudly present the world's first E-INK
monitor.

UPDATE:
Dear CBR friends
Thank you very much again for your support!
Pls contact tian (at) szobt.com
if you want to order a CBR after the campaign.
Pls also
visit our 2nd Indiegogo project: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rocktheink/x/3419900
and let more people know about it.
We are working on new projects. 
Pls. follow our twitter or youtube. We will
announce them once finished.
Twitter: EINKODM

Best regards
Your EINK ODM team

What is it?
It is the world's first E-INK Ebook Reader and
Monitor 2in1 device. We call it CBR. After the campaign ending, we
will reveal what CBR stands for to our contributors.
The purpose of this project is to use a regular
E-INK ebook reader as a second computer monitor, displaying text or images that
are displayed on LCD/TV monitors onto the E-INK ebook reader device. It’s better
for the eyes and much more readable for the user.

How does CBR work?
As an E-INK ebook reader: just use it like
any E-INK ebook reader.


Update (14th Sep. 2013): New UI with the ""Monitor"" icon:



As an E-INK monitor:
Just connect the CBR to the USB port of
your computer.



Advantages


CBR is your eye-friendly E-INK companion.

It is mobile. Take it with you. Read ebooks everywhere, at home, on
the beach…

Connect it to your computer. Surf and work on it without getting eye strain.

Great for people who don't really need color monitor, such as children,
students, programmers, scientists, office workers, etc.

Great for working in sunlight. Try to read on a LCD/LED display such
as your smart phone in sunlight. You will notice the difference. E-INK panels
deliver clear, crisp text and images with no glare.

Great for people with eye problems.

Built-in light (for the advanced CBR) evenly illuminates the screen
to provide the perfect reading experience in all lighting conditions.

Holds up to 1,100 books - take your library wherever you go.

Built-in Wi-Fi lets you download books in few seconds.

Supports comics formats: CBR and CBZ



What is E-INK?
E-INK displays are great for your eyes
The E-INK (also called electronic paper or
epaper) screen is easier on the eyes for reading documents and web pages. Its
displays are easier to read than backlight displays, because they mimic the
appearance of ink on paper. You will not experience eye strain after long time
reading.
E-INK enabled displays are easily readable
even in direct sunlight because E-INK displays reflect light like ordinary
paper.
E-INK enabled displays are green
If we could replace all paper newspapers
with eNewspapers tomorrow, it would save 95 million trees which could remove 98
million tons of greenhouse gas each year.
E-INK Displays save 60% energy vs. LCD/LED. There
are 6 billion electronic displays in mobile devices, computers and signage
worldwide consuming 2,300,000 Megawatt Hours.
CBR Features:
2 in 1 E-INK EBook Reader + E-INK Monitor
1. 
As an E-INK ebook reader: Our CBR
features all functionalities of an ebook reader like reading ePUB, PDF, TXT,
FB2, HTML, etc books, watching images like JPG, BMP, and reading comics.
Just take it with
you.
2. 
Eye-friendly and easy to use E-INK
monitor
Connect it to
the USB port of your computer as a second monitor.

What have we done so far?
We had already made the prototype of our CBR
and its molding in March 2013. A small quantity trial production was
implemented in May 2013, it was very successful. Our software and hardware
design is complete. What you see on the photos are real working units.

Why do we need your help?
We need your support at Indiegogo to help us to
fund our first mass production and manufacturing run. That means making
thousands of these devices to ship around the world. We also need your help to
develop ebook reader monitors with bigger size display such as 9.7inch. You'll
be worldwide amongst the first to have one so you can tell your friends and the
whole world too. 
If you cannot contribute the dollar, but you
are willing to help us to make some noise on facebook, twitter, google+ or any
other similar websites, we would also be very grateful for your help.
What's Next?
We’re now getting ready to start production of
our CBR but we need your help to accomplish that. With the support from
Indiegogo we'll be able to start our first manufacturing run and we hope
to start shipping them to you in November 2013. 
The product contains an E-INK Ebook reader with
a USB cable and a microfiber protection bag in one box. 
The products you will get:
The CBRs are available in two display types, E-INK
panel with and without light. 
1.  The
standard device uses a 6inch E-INK pearl white panel without front light,
resolution: 800x600.
2.  The
advanced device uses a 6inch E-INK pearl white HD panel with front light,
resolution: 1024x758. With the front light, you can even use it in the
darkness. (The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite uses such a panel with front light)
About us:
We are a small development team specialized
in the development of E-INK-based devices such as Ebook readers, price display,
educational backpack, etc.
We started working together some years ago on
several new concepts with the aim of creating innovative solutions that would
make life easier for everyone who used them. We believe in innovation and
breakthrough, and that every problem must have a solution.

<p>SMRT Mouth provides peace of mind. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research, 54 high school football players died from heat stroke since 1995. An estimated 9,000 high school athletes are treated for heat illness annually, particularly during August, according to the Centers for Disease Control. SMRT Mouth provides biometric information that can help mitigate heat-related illness.</p>
<p>Proper hydration is also critical to regulating your body temperature and delivering oxygen, which helps transport nutrients to your muscles. Over 80% of muscle sprains and pulls are attributed to dehydration and overexertion. Without proper hydration, your muscles weaken, cramp and eventually spasm. When your water intake is balanced, you experience gains in performance while reducing fatigue. SMRT Mouth will help you figure out it’s time for a water break.</p>

<p>Other than more designs and decals, there have been few innovations and advances in mouth guards since 1947, when a Los Angeles dentist used transparent acrylic resin to fit the upper and lower teeth. SMRT Mouth utilizes wearable sensors to collect biometric data that is transmitted to mobile devices via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The app has different sensors that transmit data in different increments. For instance, your heart rates changes by the second, while your hydration level does not. Over time, the app and data will provide each athlete more clarity so they can find their “Zone.” And if parents are running late to the field, they can still track their child’s biometrics remotely.</p>

  Whether playing in the big leagues or for a local high school team, athletes are expected to perform their very best. But how can you or your coach tell when you’ve reached your limit?  
Meant for pint-sized & pro athletes alike, SMRT Mouth does a lot more than just protect your teeth. It tracks your key biometrics.

Tracking hydration, circulation, respiration, and exertion in real-time allows athletes and coaches to know when they need to hydrate, when they can go harder, and when they need to cool off. It can even be worn during non-contact sports to help athletes avoid problems like cramping or dehydration.
  Let's Change The Game 
The SMRT Move
Prevent Dehydration
 
SMRT Mouth provides peace of mind. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research, 54 high school football players died from heat stroke since 1995. An estimated 9,000 high school athletes are treated for heat illness annually, particularly during August, according to the Centers for Disease Control. SMRT Mouth provides biometric information that can help mitigate heat-related illness.
Proper hydration is also critical to regulating your body temperature and delivering oxygen, which helps transport nutrients to your muscles. Over 80% of muscle sprains and pulls are attributed to dehydration and overexertion. Without proper hydration, your muscles weaken, cramp and eventually spasm. When your water intake is balanced, you experience gains in performance while reducing fatigue. SMRT Mouth will help you figure out it’s time for a water break.
 
SMRT Sync
Track Biometrics From Mouth guard
 
Other than more designs and decals, there have been few innovations and advances in mouth guards since 1947, when a Los Angeles dentist used transparent acrylic resin to fit the upper and lower teeth. SMRT Mouth utilizes wearable sensors to collect biometric data that is transmitted to mobile devices via Bluetooth.
The app has different sensors that transmit data in different increments. For instance, your heart rates changes by the second, while your hydration level does not. Over time, the app and data will provide each athlete more clarity so they can find their “Zone.” And if parents are running late to the field, they can still track their child’s biometrics remotely.

Real Time Stats At A Glance

 
SMRT Mouth is designed for continuous use during training, practice and competition to provide real-time data that can help athletes optimize performance. The embedded heart rate monitor measures the most important vital statistic an active person can generate: Heart Rate Variability (HRV). An unhealthy heart is like a musician with no soul, beating at a robotic pace with intervals of identical length between each pulse. A healthy heart - like a musician with soul - goes with the flow, with beat intervals of varying length.
 
What Makes It SMRT?

 
SMRT Mouth measures osmolality in biofluid, which allows the sensor nodes to measure hydration. Tracking pulse for circulation and using an accelerometer for exertion, SMRT Mouth sends information to mobile devices. SMRT Mouth has a microcontroller with integrated BLE for wireless communications and can support a plurality of sensors that provide a small, electrical footprint. The BLE protocol offers up to 80% energy savings over classic Bluetooth.

Having the right food within your reach makes a huge and telling difference on your body over a long period of time. Having a healthy, balanced meal each day will make us feel better, and also keep the weight under control!
We created Fittbo to be the ultimate food box as it is:

easy to use
easy to clean
100% leakproof
microwave safe food tray
designed to fit the contemporary, always on the go lifestyle
thermo-insulated to keep the food fresh throughout the day
compartmented to hold everything you need to make a balanced diet in one place.  

  Fittbo is also available in black and you will get to choose the color before shipping!  
 


The main section lids are fitted with a rubber gasket for each compartment. The food tray also has a gasket that holds the entire body and exterior shell together as one piece. Even in the unlikely case you pack in a hurry and don’t close the lids correctly, the unibody designed shell won’t allow any leaking.
 

  
Fittbo is compartmented based on the ideal dinner plate for an adult.
For the main course, you have 1/2 of the space for vegetables 1/4 for low GI carbohydrates and 1/4 for lean protein.
To have enough fuel for the day, there are two small compartments for healthy snacks! These are a really important part of every diet. They help keep the appetite under control so you won't go about eating the first thing that comes your way!
  We thought a lot about how to create the compartments. After thorough research, we had to design it based on the optimum portions of nutrients. This makes it easy to keep a track of the optimum ratios of food, and transporting the different types of food separately keeps them fresh for longer.   
 
The dimensions are 9.25inch x 9.25inch x 1.59 inch - 23.5cm x 23.5cm x 4.5cm, the best size for it to be carried comfortably while still having enough food for the day!
It weighs less than 500 grams
The materials used are all premium and food safe! Made From the Highest Quality 100% Food Grade compliant, BPA Free Plastic   
  What's included in the package:   
 
 


 
We made A LOT of design prototypes. We basically wanted the box to be simple, easy to use and have a smart, clean design you'd be proud to take anywhere. Every feature we thought of had to be incorporated into the design: the insulation, the cutlery, the optimum ratio and division between compartments.As it's clear, a lot of effort has been put into designing this product. This design, combining wood with white materials has been inspired by Scandinavian products that are all over Pinterest. It has unique features smartly incorporated that no other lunchbox out there has.  Every detail is placed with a clear reason and nothing is random.    
 I’m Alan Alexandru, young designer, I've worked for some companies in the past, gaining a considerable amount of experience and understanding how a product is designed and implemented from the drawing board to the finished product. I finally got the courage to take this big step, leaving a comfy job to dedicate all my time creating products that would make life better. On this journey, i'm not alone.

<h2><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            My name is Daniel and I currently live in Cypress California. I am disabled with Cervical Spinal Stenosis secondary to acute Degenerative disc disease. I have been living in an ‘Extended Stay Motel’ for the past ten years. Honestly, it is all I can really afford. When I moved here I planned on staying six months. Getting the surgery I needed and then getting back to work. Four years passed just getting approved for Medicare and Social Security.</p>
<p>In that four years my disease progressed, became much worse. By the time I had insurance, the afore mentioned four years, my neck was in shambles. There was permanent damage to several nerve roots, and the beginnings of spinal stenosis. The nerve root damage has resulted in me having limited feeling and use of my left arm and hand.</p>
<p>The spinal stenosis has caused ‘left foot drop’ and many other medical problems and it only gets worse. I do not have the financial resources to get the <em>pricy </em>surgery that might help. I am not bitter, I just want to be safe and work at my blog whenever I can. I am not here to ask for assistance for a surgery, nothing that frivolous. I am asking for your assistance so that I can move.</p>
<p>As I said, I have been staying at this motel for the past ten years. However, recent developments have made me staying here not a viable option. First, there is the brown water. I have written about it extensively <a href=""http://theothershoe.blog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@ <em>The Other Shoe</em></a>. As well, there are three videos of this brackish water @ <em><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a></em>. I have talked and complained to the management here, yet the problem persists.</p>
<p>This property management company, that is, there is a <em>new </em>one coming… hang on I am getting ahead. This brings me to the second part, the company that has owned this building all the time I have been here is selling this building. The <em>new</em> company is taking over at the end of July. From what everyone here is being told? The new company is going to convert this building to all <em>senior living</em>. Normally this would be a <em>God send.</em> Why it is not, is simple.</p>
<p>We are being told that everyone in the building will be evicted, so that they can convert the whole building at once… and <em>“get a better class of people, living here…” </em>That, I was told, by a source close to the process. This causes me grave concerns and it was the <em>‘Straw That Broke the Camel’s Back’ </em>for me. I wanted to try to raise the money to move, again, since my first attempt did not succeed. Please, don’t get me <em>wrong</em>, everyone that gave to the original <em>Daniel’s Moving Assistance Fund </em>were angels indeed. I am touched by their help and moved by their generosity.</p>
<p>However, it takes more than I raised to move me. It has been a year, since, the last campaign. A year fraught with difficulty and growing pain, and a realization that soon I might not be able or capable to do what I do now. So, it is with a heavy heart and deep regret that I come back to Indiegogo and you to ask one more time. I come here to ask for your assistance, your help, your understanding and compassion.</p>
<p>It is only with your assistance that I can hope to escape. Escape a building with foul water, and a second story room with no elevator to get my power chair out alone.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to outline the expenses the best that I can. I have shopped for prices for this August and September. I have projected the best that I can.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>What I Need: </strong>(Please)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Truck Rental – Penske Truck Rentals = $56.00 per day + $0.79 per mile plus refilling the gas tank.  = <strong>$100.00</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Truck      Rental Deposit (Insurance as I do not currently own a car nor do I have      car insurance)  I was quoted $200 -      $250 depending on my DMV record. I have NO accidents EVER so I am hoping      for  =   <strong>$200.00 </strong>
</li>
<li>Labor to help me move… this gets      scary… From what I understand I can hire men @ the Home Depot (right      across the street) for $50.00 - $80.00 per day. I will need help packing      and throwing much stuff away. I would guess two people for two days would      be enough. @ ~ $60.00 (per) X 2 (people) X 2 (days) =   <strong>$240.00</strong>
</li>
<li>Next and Last. I will need      assistance with the initial rental and deposit. Looking on line at several      different sites. To rent a single (bachelor) here in Orange County will      cost between $1,000.00 and $1,200.00 a month in rent. I have not rented an      apartment for nearly ten years… I am sure they will want; First, Last and      a Deposit equal to at least one month’s rent.  That is the killer, and one I hope to      bring DOWN.  =   <strong>$3,000.00 - $3,600.00</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>That is all I can, in good conscience, ask for assistance. Any other expenses I will just handle the best that I can when and if they land in my lap. However, ALL the sites that I can use (to raise money) ALL charge a percent of what you raise (7%-10%), and there is a <em>‘Bank Transfer Fee’ </em>(last time it was $150.00).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Total Cost   =     $3,000.00                                    $3,600.00                   </p>
<p>                           $180.00 (6% fee)                         $216.00</p>
<p>                            <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$150.00 (Bank Fee)</span>                     <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$150.00</span></p>
<p>                         $3,330.00                                     $3,966.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore, <em>Best Case = $3,330.00 (with luck on my side and the wind at my back)</em></p>
<p><em>                  Worst Case = $3,966.00 (With it being Southern California and no ‘luck’)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I thought long and hard on this and I do not want a <em>repeat</em> of my last efforts (I did not consider all possible angles and problems… like getting the power chair out of my house) I will err on the side of caution and round this out @ <em>$5,000.00 = $4,500.00 After Indiegogo Fees and Bank Fees [Updated 714/13 dlh]</em> Just to be safe, just to be sure and not end up within striking distance and then <em>fall.</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<h2><strong>Impact:</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>      Let me be blunt, I will live longer and healthier with your help.  Moving will afford me the opportunity to find a <em>home</em> that is <em>safe</em>. This building is only safe, as it is now and that is not much, because of the efforts of myself and other residents that stood up to the drug dealers and prostitutes they used to rent to here. I took pictures and made videos of drug transactions and then shared them with the police and property management company. Only with our information and support did we rid <em>most</em> of the <em>‘Bad Elements’ </em>from this building. However, there are many residents that <em>still </em>I would not walk around this building at night alone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Freedom</em></strong> (guess that should have come first…) I can move to a building with elevators to get myself and my power chair <em>out of the building when I want! </em>Or, to a first floor room/apartment in a safer building with clean fresh water. That would give me a freedom I have not had in over eight years. Yes, it has been eight years since I was able to walk out of this building with my own two feet, and get past the front desk. My condition has worsened to the extent I cannot walk more than ¼ a block and one flight of stairs. My roommate/Caregiver helps me with everything else.</p>
<p><strong><em>IF</em></strong> I want to get out, just for fresh air or to see a movie (I have not done that in eight years, either) I need assistance. If I were to have your assistance I would be able to get in and out when <em>I want! </em>That is what I call <strong><em>Freedom.</em> </strong>That is what your help will give me; safety and freedom.</p>
<p>Last, Ii <em>know</em> that you noticed... you are very smart, that the total is $4,000.00 and I asked for $5,000.00. The remaining monies will go to; GLASSES that I have not had in SIX YEARS, some little trift store furniture... I currently only own a bed and frame, and some decorations for the new home... to make it more like a HOME. Maybe go out to dinner and see a movie in a theater, and money to SAVE for (I <em>know</em> it is coming) a rainy day. I hope you understand and approve. I just want a little <em>wiggle room.</em> ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>Other Ways YOU Can Help:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Not everyone that wants to give can afford to give, I understand that… believe me I <strong>do!</strong>  However, there are <strong><em>MANY </em></strong>other ways you can help, here are a few:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>‘Share’ </em>and <em>‘Like’</em> my campaign and posts (at Facebook and The <em><a href=""http://theothershoe.blog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Other Shoe</a></em>) With YOUR Facebook friends. Just press <em>‘Share’</em> right by the <em>‘Like’</em> button. This does TWO things. It shows your Facebook friends that you <em>care</em>. Second, it shows them that you <em>approve</em></strong> <strong>of my campaign. SO many people want to help, but hesitate because they do not <em>know </em>the person (me) and do not <em>know </em>if they can be trusted. Your support, this way, is a badge of honor to me. It shows that I can be trusted to do with the money what I claim. I <em>will</em> and I will post proof , like I did with my Power Chair Campaign. </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Talk about the campaign to; friends, family, fellow church members and members of professional or hobby based groups.</strong> <strong>Just like the <em>‘Like’s </em>and <em>‘Share’s </em>above, talking about the campaign tells your friends and family that you <em>approve</em> and that you can or do give, too. Post the URL to the campaign on <em>Community Bulletin Boards</em> and even ask for a mention in the weekly newsletter @ church or @ work. Honestly, I would prefer $5.00 from 1,000 people… but I am told that is a ‘<em>pipe dream’</em>. </strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Offer goods or services as <em>‘Donations’ </em>for me to give to people who can donate money. I am going to try to find ways that I can give items as rewards for contributions. Last time I gave away <em>‘Shout-Outs’ </em>on my blog(s) and on Facebook. You make a donation, of a certain amount at a certain time, and I <em>mention your name and “Thank you!’ </em>in the public domain for everyone to see. This was very popular last time. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Offer your time or assistance with me managing the campaign. Offer to share a recipe <em><a href=""http://theothershoe.blog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@ The Other Shoe</a></em> or an entertaining article. One of the most <em>difficult</em> tasks for me is keeping up the content and posting along with everything else I do. My pain gets SO extreme… and I leave and don’t post for a day or two. During that time my traffic falls, and so do the contributions. ANY assistance with content or posting would be of great assistance to me. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>That is all I can think of at this time. However, if I think of anything else I will share it just as soon as I can. Right now I am in extreme pain… I about finished so I am going to push through to the end. I have one more thing to say, then I will post this and pray.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<p> .</p>
<p>This is <strong><em>not </em></strong>the timing that I wanted, had planned or even desire. I <em>know</em> families are going on vacations. However, the timing was taken out of my hands. From what I am told I have, at the most, 60 days before I am forced out. Today is July 10<sup>th</sup>, 2013. I have made the campaign for 45 days, because I need the money by the end of September to avoid… the worst possible scenario. <em>If </em>you cannot give, now. Let me know and I will be happy to set up a way for you to contribute at a later time.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Last. <strong><em>“Thank YOU!” </em></strong> Let’s count how many times I say this over the next 45 days. I am guessing close to a thousand. It has taken me three days to write this… correct it… and make sure it is something I want in the public eye. Today is the day… Please. Please help me to move to a safe building with fresh clean water. A place where <strong><em>I </em></strong>can take out my power chair any time that I want without help… That would mean <strong><em>the world </em></strong>to me. And, again, <strong><em>“Thank YOU!”</em></strong></p>

However, it takes more than I raised to move me. It has been a year, since, the last campaign. A year fraught with difficulty and growing pain, and a realization that soon I might not be able or capable to do what I do now. So, it is with a heavy heart and deep regret that I come back to Indiegogo and you to ask one more time. I come here to ask for your assistance, your help, your understanding and compassion.
It is only with your assistance that I can hope to escape. Escape a building with foul water, and a second story room with no elevator to get my power chair out alone.
Now, I would like to outline the expenses the best that I can. I have shopped for prices for this August and September. I have projected the best that I can.
 

What I Need: (Please)

Truck Rental – Penske Truck Rentals = $56.00 per day + $0.79 per mile plus refilling the gas tank.  = $100.00



Truck      Rental Deposit (Insurance as I do not currently own a car nor do I have      car insurance)  I was quoted $200 -      $250 depending on my DMV record. I have NO accidents EVER so I am hoping      for  =   $200.00 

Labor to help me move… this gets      scary… From what I understand I can hire men @ the Home Depot (right      across the street) for $50.00 - $80.00 per day. I will need help packing      and throwing much stuff away. I would guess two people for two days would      be enough. @ ~ $60.00 (per) X 2 (people) X 2 (days) =   $240.00

Next and Last. I will need      assistance with the initial rental and deposit. Looking on line at several      different sites. To rent a single (bachelor) here in Orange County will      cost between $1,000.00 and $1,200.00 a month in rent. I have not rented an      apartment for nearly ten years… I am sure they will want; First, Last and      a Deposit equal to at least one month’s rent.  That is the killer, and one I hope to      bring DOWN.  =   $3,000.00 - $3,600.00


.
That is all I can, in good conscience, ask for assistance. Any other expenses I will just handle the best that I can when and if they land in my lap. However, ALL the sites that I can use (to raise money) ALL charge a percent of what you raise (7%-10%), and there is a ‘Bank Transfer Fee’ (last time it was $150.00).
.
Total Cost   =     $3,000.00                                    $3,600.00                   
                           $180.00 (6% fee)                         $216.00
                            $150.00 (Bank Fee)                     $150.00
                         $3,330.00                                     $3,966.00
 
Therefore, Best Case = $3,330.00 (with luck on my side and the wind at my back)
                  Worst Case = $3,966.00 (With it being Southern California and no ‘luck’)
 
I thought long and hard on this and I do not want a repeat of my last efforts (I did not consider all possible angles and problems… like getting the power chair out of my house) I will err on the side of caution and round this out @ $5,000.00 = $4,500.00 After Indiegogo Fees and Bank Fees [Updated 714/13 dlh] Just to be safe, just to be sure and not end up within striking distance and then fall.
.
Impact:
 
      Let me be blunt, I will live longer and healthier with your help.  Moving will afford me the opportunity to find a home that is safe. This building is only safe, as it is now and that is not much, because of the efforts of myself and other residents that stood up to the drug dealers and prostitutes they used to rent to here. I took pictures and made videos of drug transactions and then shared them with the police and property management company. Only with our information and support did we rid most of the ‘Bad Elements’ from this building. However, there are many residents that still I would not walk around this building at night alone.
Freedom (guess that should have come first…) I can move to a building with elevators to get myself and my power chair out of the building when I want! Or, to a first floor room/apartment in a safer building with clean fresh water. That would give me a freedom I have not had in over eight years. Yes, it has been eight years since I was able to walk out of this building with my own two feet, and get past the front desk. My condition has worsened to the extent I cannot walk more than ¼ a block and one flight of stairs. My roommate/Caregiver helps me with everything else.
IF I want to get out, just for fresh air or to see a movie (I have not done that in eight years, either) I need assistance. If I were to have your assistance I would be able to get in and out when I want! That is what I call Freedom. That is what your help will give me; safety and freedom.
Last, Ii know that you noticed... you are very smart, that the total is $4,000.00 and I asked for $5,000.00. The remaining monies will go to; GLASSES that I have not had in SIX YEARS, some little trift store furniture... I currently only own a bed and frame, and some decorations for the new home... to make it more like a HOME. Maybe go out to dinner and see a movie in a theater, and money to SAVE for (I know it is coming) a rainy day. I hope you understand and approve. I just want a little wiggle room. ;)
 
 Other Ways YOU Can Help:
 
Not everyone that wants to give can afford to give, I understand that… believe me I do!  However, there are MANY other ways you can help, here are a few:
 


‘Share’ and ‘Like’ my campaign and posts (at Facebook and The Other Shoe) With YOUR Facebook friends. Just press ‘Share’ right by the ‘Like’ button. This does TWO things. It shows your Facebook friends that you care. Second, it shows them that you approve of my campaign. SO many people want to help, but hesitate because they do not know the person (me) and do not know if they can be trusted. Your support, this way, is a badge of honor to me. It shows that I can be trusted to do with the money what I claim. I will and I will post proof , like I did with my Power Chair Campaign. 


Talk about the campaign to; friends, family, fellow church members and members of professional or hobby based groups. Just like the ‘Like’s and ‘Share’s above, talking about the campaign tells your friends and family that you approve and that you can or do give, too. Post the URL to the campaign on Community Bulletin Boards and even ask for a mention in the weekly newsletter @ church or @ work. Honestly, I would prefer $5.00 from 1,000 people… but I am told that is a ‘pipe dream’. 

Offer goods or services as ‘Donations’ for me to give to people who can donate money. I am going to try to find ways that I can give items as rewards for contributions. Last time I gave away ‘Shout-Outs’ on my blog(s) and on Facebook. You make a donation, of a certain amount at a certain time, and I mention your name and “Thank you!’ in the public domain for everyone to see. This was very popular last time. 
Offer your time or assistance with me managing the campaign. Offer to share a recipe @ The Other Shoe or an entertaining article. One of the most difficult tasks for me is keeping up the content and posting along with everything else I do. My pain gets SO extreme… and I leave and don’t post for a day or two. During that time my traffic falls, and so do the contributions. ANY assistance with content or posting would be of great assistance to me. 

 .
That is all I can think of at this time. However, if I think of anything else I will share it just as soon as I can. Right now I am in extreme pain… I about finished so I am going to push through to the end. I have one more thing to say, then I will post this and pray.
 
Conclusion:
 .
This is not the timing that I wanted, had planned or even desire. I know families are going on vacations. However, the timing was taken out of my hands. From what I am told I have, at the most, 60 days before I am forced out. Today is July 10th, 2013. I have made the campaign for 45 days, because I need the money by the end of September to avoid… the worst possible scenario. If you cannot give, now. Let me know and I will be happy to set up a way for you to contribute at a later time.
.
Last. “Thank YOU!”  Let’s count how many times I say this over the next 45 days. I am guessing close to a thousand. It has taken me three days to write this… correct it… and make sure it is something I want in the public eye. Today is the day… Please. Please help me to move to a safe building with fresh clean water. A place where I can take out my power chair any time that I want without help… That would mean the world to me. And, again, “Thank YOU!”",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Our very first year in action, we cleared more than 25 contractor bags full of trash and over 400 pounds of broken glass from the park. Unfortunately, the folks that are trashing the place have gone unchecked and there is another full compliment of glass on the ground. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The glass is not where our struggle ends, the City of Kalamazoo Department of Parks and Recreation has refused to empty the garbage cans with any regular schedule. The reasons that have been cited to explain this flagrant disregard to park goers include: Lack of funding (emptying the cans would take 1 hour a month), tough terrain (the city owns several atvs with trailers), and the idea that the park was designed without consideration of garbage removal. </div>
<div>
<br/>Well, we finally have a new parks director and we are seeking your help to jumpstart our campaign!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We have been doing these cleanups for four years now and have had minor success with the limited budget available. We hold tournaments and cleanup day events to raise awareness and money, but in order to make real changes, we need product to sell. The money you donate to our cause will be invested in merchandise that includes: Stickers, Discs, T-shirts, and/or bracelets. These will be resold at a reasonable price to provide funding for our fundraiser tournaments, direct park improvements (signs, better garbage receptacles, new chains on baskets, glass removal).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The first 20 people donating $25 will receive a disc of their choice out of the selection available. The first five donations of $50 gets you a pair of disc golf discs and one of our stickers! Finally, three lucky people with donations of $100 or more will receive a full set of discs, a sticker, and some special presents TBD from the manufacturers of the discs!<br/><br/>
</div>

<div>Thank you very much for your consideration!</div></div>","Hello, my name is Corey Nufer and for the past four years, I have been working for the cleaning and improving of a local disc golf course called Knollwood Park, here in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Our very first year in action, we cleared more than 25 contractor bags full of trash and over 400 pounds of broken glass from the park. Unfortunately, the folks that are trashing the place have gone unchecked and there is another full compliment of glass on the ground. 
 
The glass is not where our struggle ends, the City of Kalamazoo Department of Parks and Recreation has refused to empty the garbage cans with any regular schedule. The reasons that have been cited to explain this flagrant disregard to park goers include: Lack of funding (emptying the cans would take 1 hour a month), tough terrain (the city owns several atvs with trailers), and the idea that the park was designed without consideration of garbage removal. 

Well, we finally have a new parks director and we are seeking your help to jumpstart our campaign!

What We Need & What You Get
We have been doing these cleanups for four years now and have had minor success with the limited budget available. We hold tournaments and cleanup day events to raise awareness and money, but in order to make real changes, we need product to sell. The money you donate to our cause will be invested in merchandise that includes: Stickers, Discs, T-shirts, and/or bracelets. These will be resold at a reasonable price to provide funding for our fundraiser tournaments, direct park improvements (signs, better garbage receptacles, new chains on baskets, glass removal).
 
The first 20 people donating $25 will receive a disc of their choice out of the selection available. The first five donations of $50 gets you a pair of disc golf discs and one of our stickers! Finally, three lucky people with donations of $100 or more will receive a full set of discs, a sticker, and some special presents TBD from the manufacturers of the discs!

Any amount of funds raised will be put toward merchandise whether the goal is not met, has been reached, or is surpassed. (If there are more donations than I have asked for, I will include something extra in each perk sent!)

<li>Yoga for Personal Trainers Course: $219; Offered by the Academy for Holistic Fitness and recognized by NASM, this course would help me bring the mind-body focus of yoga to my one-on-one sessions with clients.  </li>

Heels on
the Ground’s (HOTG) mission is to improve and enrich the quality of life for caregivers
of America’s wounded soldiers by providing local support networks, workshops

HOTG firmly believes

artist from NYC. I am transgender (meaning that the gender was assigned 
at birth is not my gender). I am disabled. I am a very friendly person 
with a lot of serious anxiety, most notably in regards to my chest and 
the assumptions people make about my gender. Going out can induce severe
 panic attacks that negatively affect my already compromised heath. 
Getting a desperately-needed double mastectomy will majorly improve my 
quality of life and mental health! Unfortunately, this is not something 
my insurance will cover, and all things considered this will cost me 
over $8000 out-of-pocket which is not attainable on my own, which is why
 I need your help! <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>All funding will go to fund my surgery, with a small portion 
allotted for the travel and accommodations I will need during the week 
or so recovery period. I have a surgeon selected, Dr. Beverly Fischer. I
 have seen patient results and am extremely impressed, and she isn't too
 far from me.</li>
<li>This campaign may not have as many perks as most, but a chance
 to get a custom piece of art from me may be enticing! I will also 
mention backers in a thank you post on my well-known tumblr, transrants!</li>
<li>If I don't reach my full goal, all proceeds will be placed in 
my top-surgery fund. Regardless of whether I make my funding goal, your 
contribution will majorly help in getting me this surgery I so 
desperately need.</li>
</ul>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>Impact  <ul>
<li>On a global scale, this may not mean much. But this surgery will 
quite literally change my life and allow me to live my life with so much
 more confidence and happiness. At this current time, every time I go 
out I get jeered at because I do not fit the stereotypical expectations 
of either binary gender.</li>
<li>Many other transgender and disabled people have been able to 
achieve surgery goals through crowdfunding. A single dollar towards my 
surgery is a step forward to getting this surgery I need so badly.</li>
</ul>
</h3>
<p></p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!
 All I ask is for you to SHARE this campaign wherever you can. Like I 
said, a single dollar will get me that much closer to a major 
life-changing surgery I desperately need, so by boosting it to your 
friends, family, and followers, you are helping me majorly to reach 
those who can donate.<br/><br/>(NOTE: Don't forget to contact me to tell 
me who you are if you are selecting promo perks, and don't forget to 
send me what you want drawn if you are selecting art perks!)</p>

over $8000 out-of-pocket which is not attainable on my own, which is why
 I need your help!  What I Need & What You Get 
All funding will go to fund my surgery, with a small portion 
allotted for the travel and accommodations I will need during the week 
or so recovery period. I have a surgeon selected, Dr. Beverly Fischer. I
 have seen patient results and am extremely impressed, and she isn't too
 far from me.
This campaign may not have as many perks as most, but a chance
 to get a custom piece of art from me may be enticing! I will also 
mention backers in a thank you post on my well-known tumblr, transrants!
If I don't reach my full goal, all proceeds will be placed in 
my top-surgery fund. Regardless of whether I make my funding goal, your 
contribution will majorly help in getting me this surgery I so 
desperately need.

  
Impact  
On a global scale, this may not mean much. But this surgery will 
quite literally change my life and allow me to live my life with so much
 more confidence and happiness. At this current time, every time I go 
out I get jeered at because I do not fit the stereotypical expectations 
of either binary gender.
Many other transgender and disabled people have been able to 
achieve surgery goals through crowdfunding. A single dollar towards my 
surgery is a step forward to getting this surgery I need so badly.


 Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!
 All I ask is for you to SHARE this campaign wherever you can. Like I 
said, a single dollar will get me that much closer to a major 
life-changing surgery I desperately need, so by boosting it to your 
friends, family, and followers, you are helping me majorly to reach 
those who can donate.(NOTE: Don't forget to contact me to tell 
me who you are if you are selecting promo perks, and don't forget to 
send me what you want drawn if you are selecting art perks!)",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Ultimate Muscle Confusion</h3>
<p>Ultimate Muscle Confusion (UMC) is the easiest and best way
to get and stay in shape.  UMC uses a
system created by former college football player Bobby Bluford that combines
two scientifically proven methods for increasing lean muscle and decreasing
body fat- Muscle Confusion and High Intensity Interval Training.  We are currently building both a website and
an iphone and Android app to remove the barriers that prevent people from
maintaining momentum in their fitness and exercise program: <b>Time and Equipment Availability</b>.  We are in the process of developing and
offering the following features:</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Website</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">Members have access to workout videos based on
the UMC training system (see below for details on the UMC training philosophy).  The videos vary in time (10-50 minutes),
equipment used (from nothing at all or things you’d find around the home or
office to things you’d find in a fully equipped gym such as dumbbells and
barbells), and body parts worked (many are overall body, while others focus on
a specific group of muscles or specific purpose such as speed development or
agility improvement).  Additionally, the
videos are in real-time, so members can simply press play and follow along for
a complete workout, including warm up, cool-down, and motivational
encouragement with one of UMC’s talented and engaging trainers.</span></li>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">Members can set goals and track their progress
via reports, summaries, and various fitness tests.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Members check in periodically, recording their
results along 5 dimensions that include weight, body fat/BMI, and measurements.</span></li>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">Members log UMC minutes, earning shirts upon the
completion of certain levels.  For
example, 5,000 minutes logged (roughly 1 year @ 3 workouts per week) earns a
Green “5,000 Minute Club” Shirt</span></li>
</ul>

<br/><ul>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">The site will highlight and spotlight members at all levels for achievements including the reaching of minute milestones (new shirt color) and personal bests in fitness tests.</span></li>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">Members can build “Workout Buddies” lists,
teaming up with other members for motivation and encouragement; competition; or
just fun.</span></li>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">Members can view live group exercise sessions
(mostly bootcamps) from anywhere in the world. 
Select members (e.g. personal trainers who employ the UMC system) will
also have the ability to conduct their own exercise classes to broadcast to
other members.</span></li>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">Members will be able to find other members in
their geographic area and “meet up” for workouts if desired.</span></li>
<li><span class=""notranlsate"">Members can participate in live webinars with
experts in fields such as nutrition and sports training, which will be
available frequently (monthly, then weekly, then several times per week).</span></li>

<p></p>
<b>Mobile Site and Workout Tool (App)</b><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">When logged in, members can view the activity of
their “Workout Buddies”, including who is currently working out and how much
time they have remaining in their workouts. 
Members will be able to send real-time motivational messages to their
workout buddies.</span><br/>

<b></b><p><b>Where the UMC idea came from?</b></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">The Ultimate Muscle Confusion
(UMC) exercise system was created out of necessity. </span><br/></p>
<p><i>“I played football in college, so I’ve always been a gym
rat.  For years after I graduated from
college and finished my football career, I was working out 2 hours a day, 6-7
times per week.  But, as I got older and
began advancing in my career (in Corporate Finance) and building a family, I
found it more and more difficult to spend hours in the gym.  I simply didn’t have the time, or the energy,
to keep such an extensive and time-consuming workout regimen.”<br/></i>
-<b> Bobby Bluford; Founder, UMC </b>  </p>
<p>UMC removes the major barrier that prevents people from
getting and staying in great physical condition- MOMENTUM!</p>
<b></b><p>
<b>What do we mean by MOMENTUM?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We all have what we at UMC term “fitness seizures” at
times.  These moments where we tell
ourselves “Enough is Enough!” happen throughout the year.  Maybe we come across an old photo of
ourselves when we were thin.  Or we see
an old teammate that tells us how “buff [we] <b>used</b> to be.”  Or maybe we
just pass by the mirror after a shower or go for an annual checkup at the
doctor and finally confirm the weight we were pretty sure we’d gained.  And we all have this same fitness seizure on
or near January 1 of every year when we vow to ourselves and loved ones that we
are going to exercise more and eat better.</p>
<p>When these fitness seizures happen, what do we do?  We go out and buy new fitness gear or running
shoes.  We join the local gym or hire a
personal trainer.  And we rush to the local
supermarket and nearly clear out the produce section and health food aisles.  All of this builds <b>MOMENTUM</b>.  We are gung ho,
overwhelmingly excited about our future. 
This “fitness seizure” lasts several days or weeks and the <b>MOMENTUM</b> builds as we see a difference
in how we both look and feel.  This
discipline, this <b>MOMENTUM</b>, might
even last a few months.  But more times
than not, something eventually happens to derail our well-laid plans, to
interrupt our schedules.  We travel
across the country for work and are confined to a hotel room for days.  Or we are stuck at the office until late at
night for a week straight trying to meet an important deadline.  Or we’re unable to get to the gym or even pop
in our favorite fitness DVD because our child is home sick with the flu.  Inevitably, life has its way of putting a
wrench into our plans.  The result: <b>MOMENTUM</b> lost!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How does UMC fix
that, helping you to maintain MOMENTUM?</b></p>
<p>UMC helps people build and maintain fitness <b>MOMENTUM</b> by removing the two major constraints
that people face: <b>TIME AVAILABILITY</b> and
<b>EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY</b>.</p>

<td width=""500"">Working out at the gym is great; having a personal trainer is even better.  But one session, when you include travel time to and from the location, requires an investment in time of up to an hour and a half.  Popular fitness DVDs remove travel time from the equation, but the time for those workouts is fixed and difficult to adjust.  For example, if a particular DVD workout is 40 minutes, but you only have 20 minutes to work out, what do you do?  Are you going to start it and stop half way through?  Are you going to skip the warm-up?  The odds are that you are going to skip the workout altogether.  The simple truth is that, historically, fitness options have required people to adjust their lives to fit them in, not the other way around.  NOT WITH UMC! The UMC Workout Tool/App allows the user to choose how much time she has to work out.  From 10 to 50 minutes, furthermore, the Workout Tool adjusts for warm-up and cool-down accordingly.  All of the thinking is done for the user.  With UMC, working out and staying fit is no longer an “All or Nothing” proposition.   </td>

<td width=""500"">If you are in a gym, you have access to everything you need to work out.  You might even have your home set up to get a great workout most of the time.  But what if you don’t belong to a gym or have an efficient setup at home?  What if you don’t have a lot of equipment.  Or anything at all.  Or maybe you just have a jump rope and a medicine ball.  IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE!  With the UMC Workout Tool/App, it doesn’t matter what equipment you have or where you are.  With an ever-growing database of exercises, requiring different types of equipment or none at all, the UMC Workout Tool/App is always able to put together a great workout for you.  Whether you are a beginner that prefers only bodyweight exercises or an experienced athlete who loves the challenges that weightlifting, power movements, and plyometrics present, the UMC Workout Tool/App accommodates you. As a matter of fact, the best thing about the UMC Workout Tool/App is that it allows you to progress in your fitness at your own rate.  You can start out with 10-minute workouts, using only bodyweight exercises and those that use items that are readily available such as kitchen chairs or office desks.  Later, you can purchase a few items such as a pair of light dumbbells or a jump rope, adding to the set of possible exercises.  Slowly, you can make the workouts longer, then add resistance bands, pull-up bars, or even a sandbag and make your workouts even more intense.  And when you are ready to join a gym or take your workouts to the next level, the Workout Tool/App will be there with you.</td>

<b></b><p><b>The UMC Training Philosophy</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Ultimate Muscle Confusion combines two well known and scientifically proven methods for both building muscle and losing weight: <b>High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</b> and <b>Muscle Confusion</b>.  But even though these ideas are not new, UMC has made two significant upgrades, making the UMC system unique and <b>PATENT PENDING</b>.</p>
<ul><li><b>High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</b></li></ul>
<table align=""center"" border=""0""><tbody><tr>
<td width=""50"">
</td>
<td width=""500"">
<b><i>What is it?</i></b> <br/>An exercise strategy where short intense periods of exercise are followed by brief recovery periods.  Common examples include the 40/20 split, where intense exercise periods of 40 seconds are followed by rest periods of 20 seconds.
<br/><br/><b><i>UMC’s Enhancement</i></b><br/>Rather than have a uniform and constant mix of exercise and full recovery (rest) periods, the UMC philosophy is based on 30-second exercise periods with few, if any, scheduled recovery periods.  Furthermore, the UMC recovery periods are almost never full rest periods.  Instead, UMC uses Active Recovery Periods, which usually consist of jogging or walking in place and abdominal/core work).  The UMC system requires that users monitor their own rest periods.  This does two things.  First, it reduces the total workout time, allowing users to get a great workout in a fraction of the time other fitness methods take.  And secondly, it allows the user to control his own fitness, taking breaks as he sees fit (during any exercise period).  This creates a great self-evaluation tool, allowing the user to feel himself improving as the self-imposed rest periods become shorter and less frequent.

<ul><li><b>Muscle Confusion</b></li></ul>
<table align=""center"" border=""0""><tbody><tr>
<td width=""50"">
</td>
<td width=""500"">
<b><i>What is it?</i></b> <br/>A training principle based on the belief that the body’s muscles accommodate and adjust to specific types of stress if the stimuli are not adjusted or changed.  The theory states that, because the body is amazingly capable of adapting to anything it repeatedly encounters, building muscle and losing weight requires continuous change in the exercises those muscles are asked to perform.  

<br/><br/><b><i>UMC’s Enhancement</i></b><br/>DVD programs that are based on High Intensity Interval Training are fixed.   No matter how many DVDs are in the set, eventually your body will adjust.  Or you will become bored.  And whether the workouts use weights or they rely on bodyweight exercises, the actual workouts do not change.  Even if there are 20 workouts in a DVD collection, for example, those 20 workouts will always be the same length, using the same equipment.  The “U” in UMC refers to ULTIMATE because the workouts the system produces are ALWAYS DIFFERENT.  Whether through a certified UMC instructor or the UMC Workout Tool/App, each exercise in a UMC workout is almost completely randomly selected.   Once the time available and equipment available is determined, the workout possibilities are unlimited in both variety and intensity.</td>

<p></p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t need to spend hours in the gym; I spend
half as much time working out as I used to.</li>
<li>I don’t need to rely solely on weights to get a
great workout; I use weights roughly ½ of the time and RARELY lift heavy.</li>
<li>I don’t need to lift heavy to gain size, nor
lift light to gain definition.  If I push
myself as hard as I can for 30 seconds at a time, everything else will take
care of itself.  I can’t go for 30
seconds with weights that are too heavy. 
And I can’t push myself for those same 30 seconds if I go too light.  Yet, as you’ll see in #7, these workouts are
as productive as any I’ve ever done.</li>
<li>I don’t need to do traditional cardio (jogging,
riding the stationary bike, or using the stairmaster); instead, I rely on the
continuous movement that is the foundation of UMC to burn calories.</li>
<li>I don’t have to always have a plan for my
workout.  I simply decide what equipment
I want to use and how long I want to work out, then simply start.  I often literally take it one half minute (30
seconds) at a time.</li>
<li>
<p>Working out and general fitness is not an <b>“All or Nothing”</b> proposition.  If I have 10 minutes to work out, then I’ll
work out for 10 minutes.  If I have 50,
then 50 it is.</p>
<b>..And Most Importantly</b>
</li>
<li><p>I’m 40 and I look and feel as good as I did when
I was 20, well before I realized all of this!</p></li>

<p>In January of 2013, I began using the UMC system in bootcamps that I conduct.  Because of my experience using this methodology, I am able to create dynamic, challenging workouts that are completely different every time.

<b>Development of the
Workout Tool/App</b></b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
Ultimate Muscle Confusion (UMC) Workout Tool/App is currently being developed
and is due to be fully released in the Fall of 2013.  We are currently filming the hundreds of
video clips (each 30 seconds in length) that will make up the video
library.  As described earlier, the tool
will ask the user a series of questions that will determine how many and which
videos to pull for possible inclusion in the workout. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/32874/files/20130825113213-dashboard_userflow.jpg?1377455533"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>From this subset of videos that match the user’s criteria, the
initial version of the Workout Tool will then randomly select a video x number
of times, where x is the number of minutes available to work out times two (2),
until the requisite number of videos is pulled together to create a continuous
video reel.  Later versions will build
upon this logic, increasing the complexity of the algorithm used to create the
workout, taking into account the user’s ability level and progression, as well
as grouping exercises and stacking them into what we call rounds.  For example, the Workout Tool/App might randomly
select the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Push-Ups</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Planks</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Squats</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Burpees</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, group those four exercises into one round, having the user repeat
the four-exercise group two or three times, separated by an exercise (video)
that is conducive to slight recovery, then smooth transition.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Push-Ups</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Planks</span><br/>

Ultimate Muscle Confusion (UMC) is the easiest and best way
to get and stay in shape.  UMC uses a
system created by former college football player Bobby Bluford that combines
two scientifically proven methods for increasing lean muscle and decreasing
body fat- Muscle Confusion and High Intensity Interval Training.  We are currently building both a website and
an iphone and Android app to remove the barriers that prevent people from
maintaining momentum in their fitness and exercise program: Time and Equipment Availability.  We are in the process of developing and
offering the following features:

Website


Members have access to workout videos based on
the UMC training system (see below for details on the UMC training philosophy).  The videos vary in time (10-50 minutes),
equipment used (from nothing at all or things you’d find around the home or
office to things you’d find in a fully equipped gym such as dumbbells and
barbells), and body parts worked (many are overall body, while others focus on
a specific group of muscles or specific purpose such as speed development or
agility improvement).  Additionally, the
videos are in real-time, so members can simply press play and follow along for
a complete workout, including warm up, cool-down, and motivational
encouragement with one of UMC’s talented and engaging trainers.
Members can set goals and track their progress
via reports, summaries, and various fitness tests.
Members check in periodically, recording their
results along 5 dimensions that include weight, body fat/BMI, and measurements.
Members log UMC minutes, earning shirts upon the
completion of certain levels.  For
example, 5,000 minutes logged (roughly 1 year @ 3 workouts per week) earns a
Green “5,000 Minute Club” Shirt



The site will highlight and spotlight members at all levels for achievements including the reaching of minute milestones (new shirt color) and personal bests in fitness tests.
Members can build “Workout Buddies” lists,
teaming up with other members for motivation and encouragement; competition; or
just fun.
Members can view live group exercise sessions
(mostly bootcamps) from anywhere in the world. 
Select members (e.g. personal trainers who employ the UMC system) will
also have the ability to conduct their own exercise classes to broadcast to
other members.
Members will be able to find other members in
their geographic area and “meet up” for workouts if desired.
Members can participate in live webinars with
experts in fields such as nutrition and sports training, which will be
available frequently (monthly, then weekly, then several times per week).


Mobile Site and Workout Tool (App)



When logged in, members can view the activity of
their “Workout Buddies”, including who is currently working out and how much
time they have remaining in their workouts. 
Members will be able to send real-time motivational messages to their
workout buddies.







“Keep it up, Jim!”





“I’m gonna grab my shoes and join you,
Jill!”




Members can run any off-the-shelf videos
available on the website from their mobile device.  These videos can be downloaded and stored
(automatically or manually) to the member’s mobile device for use in offline
mode.  Which videos a member can view
will be dependent upon the user’s membership level (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold,
Platinum)
Members can run the Proprietary Workout
Tool/App.  Running the Workout Tool is
simple and fast.  The user simply answers
a few questions:






How much time do you have? (10, 20, 30, 40, or
50 minutes)

What equipment is available to you? (medicine ball, chair, wall, open running area, dumbbells, jump rope, etc.)


What body parts do you want to focus on? (e.g. a woman’s trouble areas, a man who wants to get a good chest pump before going to the beach)


What body parts do you want to avoid? (e.g. a bad knee or elbow, lower back pain)


What intensity level do you want? (light, moderate, heavy, intense)





The Workout Tool/App pulls from an ever-growing
database of 30-second exercise video clips (See Below for UMC Training
Philosophy) any and all videos that meet the criteria set by the questions the
member answered.
The Workout Tool/App randomly selects a video
from this subset of videos  x number of
times, where x is the number of minutes available to workout (question #1) times
two (2), then strings together all of the videos into a video reel.  For example, if the member desires a
10-minute workout, the Workout Tool/App will pull 20 (10 x 2) 30-second videos.
Once the Workout Tool/App has finished creating
the workout reel, the member will see a “Start” button.
The member can press play to begin the workout
Once the workout is completed, the minutes,
exercises, and specific playlist are all logged and saved in the member’s
profile.  How much information is kept
and stored for later use and analysis will be dependent upon the user’s
membership level (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
Members can save, share, and create custom
workouts.  This feature will be dependent
upon the user’s membership level (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
Members will receive weekly meal plans, along
with shopping lists.  This feature will
be dependent upon the user’s membership level (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold,
Platinum)
Members will correspond periodically (via phone,
email, and chat) with healthy lifestyle coaches.  This feature will be dependent upon the
user’s membership level (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)



Where the UMC idea came from?
The Ultimate Muscle Confusion
(UMC) exercise system was created out of necessity. 
“I played football in college, so I’ve always been a gym
rat.  For years after I graduated from
college and finished my football career, I was working out 2 hours a day, 6-7
times per week.  But, as I got older and
began advancing in my career (in Corporate Finance) and building a family, I
found it more and more difficult to spend hours in the gym.  I simply didn’t have the time, or the energy,
to keep such an extensive and time-consuming workout regimen.”
- Bobby Bluford; Founder, UMC   
UMC removes the major barrier that prevents people from
getting and staying in great physical condition- MOMENTUM!

What do we mean by MOMENTUM?

We all have what we at UMC term “fitness seizures” at
times.  These moments where we tell
ourselves “Enough is Enough!” happen throughout the year.  Maybe we come across an old photo of
ourselves when we were thin.  Or we see
an old teammate that tells us how “buff [we] used to be.”  Or maybe we
just pass by the mirror after a shower or go for an annual checkup at the
doctor and finally confirm the weight we were pretty sure we’d gained.  And we all have this same fitness seizure on
or near January 1 of every year when we vow to ourselves and loved ones that we
are going to exercise more and eat better.
When these fitness seizures happen, what do we do?  We go out and buy new fitness gear or running
shoes.  We join the local gym or hire a
personal trainer.  And we rush to the local
supermarket and nearly clear out the produce section and health food aisles.  All of this builds MOMENTUM.  We are gung ho,
overwhelmingly excited about our future. 
This “fitness seizure” lasts several days or weeks and the MOMENTUM builds as we see a difference
in how we both look and feel.  This
discipline, this MOMENTUM, might
even last a few months.  But more times
than not, something eventually happens to derail our well-laid plans, to
interrupt our schedules.  We travel
across the country for work and are confined to a hotel room for days.  Or we are stuck at the office until late at
night for a week straight trying to meet an important deadline.  Or we’re unable to get to the gym or even pop
in our favorite fitness DVD because our child is home sick with the flu.  Inevitably, life has its way of putting a
wrench into our plans.  The result: MOMENTUM lost!

How does UMC fix
that, helping you to maintain MOMENTUM?
UMC helps people build and maintain fitness MOMENTUM by removing the two major constraints
that people face: TIME AVAILABILITY and
EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY.

Time Availability




Working out at the gym is great; having a personal trainer is even better.  But one session, when you include travel time to and from the location, requires an investment in time of up to an hour and a half.  Popular fitness DVDs remove travel time from the equation, but the time for those workouts is fixed and difficult to adjust.  For example, if a particular DVD workout is 40 minutes, but you only have 20 minutes to work out, what do you do?  Are you going to start it and stop half way through?  Are you going to skip the warm-up?  The odds are that you are going to skip the workout altogether.  The simple truth is that, historically, fitness options have required people to adjust their lives to fit them in, not the other way around.  NOT WITH UMC! The UMC Workout Tool/App allows the user to choose how much time she has to work out.  From 10 to 50 minutes, furthermore, the Workout Tool adjusts for warm-up and cool-down accordingly.  All of the thinking is done for the user.  With UMC, working out and staying fit is no longer an “All or Nothing” proposition.   

Equipment Availability



If you are in a gym, you have access to everything you need to work out.  You might even have your home set up to get a great workout most of the time.  But what if you don’t belong to a gym or have an efficient setup at home?  What if you don’t have a lot of equipment.  Or anything at all.  Or maybe you just have a jump rope and a medicine ball.  IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE!  With the UMC Workout Tool/App, it doesn’t matter what equipment you have or where you are.  With an ever-growing database of exercises, requiring different types of equipment or none at all, the UMC Workout Tool/App is always able to put together a great workout for you.  Whether you are a beginner that prefers only bodyweight exercises or an experienced athlete who loves the challenges that weightlifting, power movements, and plyometrics present, the UMC Workout Tool/App accommodates you. As a matter of fact, the best thing about the UMC Workout Tool/App is that it allows you to progress in your fitness at your own rate.  You can start out with 10-minute workouts, using only bodyweight exercises and those that use items that are readily available such as kitchen chairs or office desks.  Later, you can purchase a few items such as a pair of light dumbbells or a jump rope, adding to the set of possible exercises.  Slowly, you can make the workouts longer, then add resistance bands, pull-up bars, or even a sandbag and make your workouts even more intense.  And when you are ready to join a gym or take your workouts to the next level, the Workout Tool/App will be there with you.

The UMC Training Philosophy


Ultimate Muscle Confusion combines two well known and scientifically proven methods for both building muscle and losing weight: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and Muscle Confusion.  But even though these ideas are not new, UMC has made two significant upgrades, making the UMC system unique and PATENT PENDING.
High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)




What is it? An exercise strategy where short intense periods of exercise are followed by brief recovery periods.  Common examples include the 40/20 split, where intense exercise periods of 40 seconds are followed by rest periods of 20 seconds.
UMC’s EnhancementRather than have a uniform and constant mix of exercise and full recovery (rest) periods, the UMC philosophy is based on 30-second exercise periods with few, if any, scheduled recovery periods.  Furthermore, the UMC recovery periods are almost never full rest periods.  Instead, UMC uses Active Recovery Periods, which usually consist of jogging or walking in place and abdominal/core work).  The UMC system requires that users monitor their own rest periods.  This does two things.  First, it reduces the total workout time, allowing users to get a great workout in a fraction of the time other fitness methods take.  And secondly, it allows the user to control his own fitness, taking breaks as he sees fit (during any exercise period).  This creates a great self-evaluation tool, allowing the user to feel himself improving as the self-imposed rest periods become shorter and less frequent.


Muscle Confusion




What is it? A training principle based on the belief that the body’s muscles accommodate and adjust to specific types of stress if the stimuli are not adjusted or changed.  The theory states that, because the body is amazingly capable of adapting to anything it repeatedly encounters, building muscle and losing weight requires continuous change in the exercises those muscles are asked to perform.  

UMC’s EnhancementDVD programs that are based on High Intensity Interval Training are fixed.   No matter how many DVDs are in the set, eventually your body will adjust.  Or you will become bored.  And whether the workouts use weights or they rely on bodyweight exercises, the actual workouts do not change.  Even if there are 20 workouts in a DVD collection, for example, those 20 workouts will always be the same length, using the same equipment.  The “U” in UMC refers to ULTIMATE because the workouts the system produces are ALWAYS DIFFERENT.  Whether through a certified UMC instructor or the UMC Workout Tool/App, each exercise in a UMC workout is almost completely randomly selected.   Once the time available and equipment available is determined, the workout possibilities are unlimited in both variety and intensity.



Where We Currently Are
Ultimate Muscle Confusion (UMC) in Action


I have been using UMC in my own life for more than two
years.  In doing so, I’ve discovered:


I don’t need to spend hours in the gym; I spend
half as much time working out as I used to.
I don’t need to rely solely on weights to get a
great workout; I use weights roughly ½ of the time and RARELY lift heavy.
I don’t need to lift heavy to gain size, nor
lift light to gain definition.  If I push
myself as hard as I can for 30 seconds at a time, everything else will take
care of itself.  I can’t go for 30
seconds with weights that are too heavy. 
And I can’t push myself for those same 30 seconds if I go too light.  Yet, as you’ll see in #7, these workouts are
as productive as any I’ve ever done.
I don’t need to do traditional cardio (jogging,
riding the stationary bike, or using the stairmaster); instead, I rely on the
continuous movement that is the foundation of UMC to burn calories.
I don’t have to always have a plan for my
workout.  I simply decide what equipment
I want to use and how long I want to work out, then simply start.  I often literally take it one half minute (30
seconds) at a time.

Working out and general fitness is not an “All or Nothing” proposition.  If I have 10 minutes to work out, then I’ll
work out for 10 minutes.  If I have 50,
then 50 it is.
..And Most Importantly

I’m 40 and I look and feel as good as I did when
I was 20, well before I realized all of this!



Bootcamp Usage


In January of 2013, I began using the UMC system in bootcamps that I conduct.  Because of my experience using this methodology, I am able to create dynamic, challenging workouts that are completely different every time.  Students in my bootcamp rave about UMC’s efficiency and enjoy the fast-paced, ever-changing nature of the program.  Here are some of the quotes:



“I never know what’s coming next.  I love it!”
“I have lifted weights for years and never sweated this much!”
“I thought I was working hard before.  I guess I was wrong.”
“In some of our workouts, we use just a chair.  I guess I have no excuses!”






Development of the
Workout Tool/App

The
Ultimate Muscle Confusion (UMC) Workout Tool/App is currently being developed
and is due to be fully released in the Fall of 2013.  We are currently filming the hundreds of
video clips (each 30 seconds in length) that will make up the video
library.  As described earlier, the tool
will ask the user a series of questions that will determine how many and which
videos to pull for possible inclusion in the workout. 

From this subset of videos that match the user’s criteria, the
initial version of the Workout Tool will then randomly select a video x number
of times, where x is the number of minutes available to work out times two (2),
until the requisite number of videos is pulled together to create a continuous
video reel.  Later versions will build
upon this logic, increasing the complexity of the algorithm used to create the
workout, taking into account the user’s ability level and progression, as well
as grouping exercises and stacking them into what we call rounds.  For example, the Workout Tool/App might randomly
select the following:


Push-Ups


Planks


Squats


Burpees


Then, group those four exercises into one round, having the user repeat
the four-exercise group two or three times, separated by an exercise (video)
that is conducive to slight recovery, then smooth transition.  For example:


Push-Ups


Planks


Squats


Burpees


Jog in Place


Push-Ups


Planks


Squats


Burpees


Jog in Place


Push-Ups


Planks


Squats


Burpees



Developers are also working on the tracking, analysis, and social media
tools that will be available to members based on their membership levels.  These tools include:

Automatic recording of workout details;
including total minutes as well as minutes broken down by body part and
intensity; time and ranking (scale of 1 to 5) of workout (to help members
realize best times to work out) 



Ability to save workouts that were particularly enjoyable.  These workouts will be available in offline mode.



Ability to connect with “Workout Buddies”.  Members can then share workouts with these “Workout Buddies” as well as see when they are working out, and can even send them motivational and encouraging messages. 



Ability to set goals and timetables, which can then be monitored manually or automatically.  For example, after each workout, a message will appear stating something like:






Goal Number of Minutes
1,000





Goal Date
8/1/2013




Minutes Toward Goal
370





Minutes Above/Below Pace
-20






 
The Workout Tool/App is being created for both the iphone and Android platforms.  Our initial focus is on the logic and algorithm behind the Workout Tool.  We will then focus strongly on the social media component, GUI, and overall user experience.


Purpose for Funding


I am looking to raise $25,000 in order to:
Professionally film and edit off-the-shelf full workouts, at a variety of lengths, using a variety of equipment.  Currently, I both film and edit these and would like to greatly improve the quality (lighting, sound, location) as well as hire others for some of the workouts.




Professionally film and edit the 30 second videos needed for the UMC Workout Tool/App.  The hope is to have 500 exercises, using a variety of equipment, by the end of 2013.  Currently, I both film and edit these and would like to greatly improve the quality (lighting, location) as well as hire others for some of the exercises.

<p><b>Problems with Traditional
LLLT Treatments for Skin</b></p>
<p>There are currently a number of different ways that LLLT is administered
to the face, but they all have significant shortfalls in providing effective
and consistent results. Here are the three main delivery methods:</p>
<p><b>1. Hand Held Devices</b> – Perhaps the most
common form of phototherapy is the hand-held system.  These types of systems are extremely
burdensome and difficult to use requiring the user to manually move the device
across the entire face surface.  While
these units do get results, they traditionally have minimal output, which will
produce fewer results than units with more surface coverage. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137349/files/20150107185520-iDerma_handhelds.jpg?1420685720"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>2. Clinical LLLT
Systems</b> – These typically provide significantly higher output and are usually
found in the offices of physicians, aesthetics practices and beauty
salons.  They provide full-surface
coverage, but use is limited to appointed times. Protocols typically
consist of one to two treatments per week for several weeks, and then treatment is
discontinued, denying the user of the full, ongoing benefits of facial LLLT. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/942062/files/20141019082407-iStock_000040264140_360x640.jpg?1413732247"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>3. Tabletop Home Use
Systems.</b> These units consist of panels of LEDs that are stand-alone units
that sit on a tabletop or vanity. 
Though of higher output than hand-held products, these units require the
user to find a comfortable position where the lights can shine onto the
treatment surface.  Since the beam size of
the LEDs is typically weaker with distance, these units do not provide consistency of use and therefore will not produce optimum, consistent results. </p>

<b>How Low-Level Light Therapy Works <span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wavelengths of red light (at 650-670nm) have been shown to
help improve the skin’s barrier function by strengthening its ability to retain key
elements it needs to heal and generate new collagen after its production has
slowed due to age or cumulative damage. Red light low-level LEDs are also
believed to target the skin’s oil glands to reduce cytokines, a class of
pro-inflammatory substances believed to play a role in chronic acne.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>Low-level red light is effective in helping to reduce signs of aging,
including fine lines and wrinkles. This wavelength appears to be a popular
choice for those struggling with both acne and wrinkles. There is minimal risk
of side effects, especially when used without light-activating chemicals. Many
dermatologists heavily rely on low-level red light therapy to treat rhytids
(wrinkles), rosacea, scarring and eczema.</span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>To treat facial fine lines and wrinkles, the iDerma Facial Beautification
System will administer low-level red light at 650 to 670nm. This wavelength
range of red light causes the cells to produce chemicals called cytokines,
which then trigger the fibroblasts or collagen-producing cells, that in turn
help heal the skin and plump up problem areas.</span></div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<b>

Q &amp; A:</b>
</div>
<div>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">How does this
compare to topicals: <span><br/></span></b>The
iDerma Facial Beautification System is a one-time investment that treats the
underlying cause rather than temporarily and 
superficially improving the skin's appearance.<span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Do you need to use the included iDerma serum for the light therapy mask to work?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>The iDerma LED Mask is effective and will produce positive results independent of any serums or creams.<br/></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">How long should I
use this?<span><br/></span></b>After the initial eight-week treatment period, a maintenance program ensures long-lasting
results from the iDerma Facial Beautification System. We suggest treating once
or twice per week or as needed.</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">How long does it
take to see results?<span><br/></span></b>For
some users, the skin looks and feels improved after several treatments;
smoother and more hydrated, skin takes on a natural radiant glow. Individual results will
vary. The average user will show the most benefit after the initial eight-week
treatment period.</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is an LED
Facial?  </b><br/>
An LED Facial is a technology-based skin treatment that uses specific wavelengths of
natural light energy to restore skin’s normal, healthy
activity. </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">How does it
work? <span><br/></span></b>The
energy delivered by the red and infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) enhances
cellular metabolism.  This in turn stimulates the body to build new
collagen, increase circulation, and improve the functioning of the lymphatic
system.  The result is younger, healthier-looking skin.  </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is there proof that
this technology works?  <span><br/></span></b>Clinical
studies, scientific and medical research, independent testing and patient
testimonials exist to prove the efficacy of light therapy. Research
conducted by NASA’s space program has proven that near-infrared LED light
therapy promotes wound healing and human tissue growth. </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Are there any
adverse effects from this treatment?  <span><br/></span></b>No. This treatment has no adverse reactions and no down-time.  LED-emitting devices are classified by the FDA as possessing
“non-significant risk” because they are completely safe and
possess no possibility of harm from over-exposure.  </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is the process
abrasive or painful?  <span><br/></span></b>No. LED treatment is a gentle, painless, safe, non-invasive and non-abrasive
treatment.  </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is the
recommended schedule for iDerma treatment?  </b><br/>

Recommended use for the
iDerma is 10 minutes three times per week for eight weeks followed by regular
maintenance of once or twice per week.</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is iDerma therapy a
good complement to other skin care treatments?  </b><br/>
Absolutely! It helps strengthen and rejuvenate the skin at a cellular
level so it amplifies the results achieved in any facial treatment. <span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I put my
make-up back on immediately?  </b><br/>
Yes, there is no downtime with this treatment.  </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I go out in the
sun after this treatment?  </b><br/>
Yes, the treatment does not increase photosensitivity.  It is recommended
that you apply a broad-spectrum UVA and UVB sunscreen every day. 
Sunscreen should be applied after every treatment.  </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Does this work for
everyone?  </b><br/>
While almost everyone can benefit from the use of light therapy, these
treatments will have the greatest impact on skin with sluggish metabolism and
slow cellular activity showing visible signs of aging. 
Contraindications for light therapy include pregnancy and epilepsy,
photoallergy, and medications that cause light sensitivity (such as
Tetracycline). Also, if you are currently taking steroids or cortisone
injections, you should not receive light therapy.</p>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">I
am not sure iDerma will properly fit my head. Does the headband adjust?</b><br/>
The iDerma device is fully adjustable to accommodate a wide range of sizes, using
a dial adjustment to increase or decrease the diameter of the strap that
secures the visor to the head and face. To ensure optimum comfort and a fully customized
fit, the iDerma is also equipped with elastic foam cushioning pads that are
customer-applied.<br/>

across the entire face surface.  While
these units do get results, they traditionally have minimal output, which will
produce fewer results than units with more surface coverage. 




2. Clinical LLLT
Systems – These typically provide significantly higher output and are usually
found in the offices of physicians, aesthetics practices and beauty
salons.  They provide full-surface
coverage, but use is limited to appointed times. Protocols typically
consist of one to two treatments per week for several weeks, and then treatment is
discontinued, denying the user of the full, ongoing benefits of facial LLLT. 



3. Tabletop Home Use
Systems. These units consist of panels of LEDs that are stand-alone units
that sit on a tabletop or vanity. 
Though of higher output than hand-held products, these units require the
user to find a comfortable position where the lights can shine onto the
treatment surface.  Since the beam size of
the LEDs is typically weaker with distance, these units do not provide consistency of use and therefore will not produce optimum, consistent results.

How Low-Level Light Therapy Works Wavelengths of red light (at 650-670nm) have been shown to
help improve the skin’s barrier function by strengthening its ability to retain key
elements it needs to heal and generate new collagen after its production has
slowed due to age or cumulative damage. Red light low-level LEDs are also
believed to target the skin’s oil glands to reduce cytokines, a class of
pro-inflammatory substances believed to play a role in chronic acne.

Low-level red light is effective in helping to reduce signs of aging,
including fine lines and wrinkles. This wavelength appears to be a popular
choice for those struggling with both acne and wrinkles. There is minimal risk
of side effects, especially when used without light-activating chemicals. Many
dermatologists heavily rely on low-level red light therapy to treat rhytids
(wrinkles), rosacea, scarring and eczema.
To treat facial fine lines and wrinkles, the iDerma Facial Beautification
System will administer low-level red light at 650 to 670nm. This wavelength
range of red light causes the cells to produce chemicals called cytokines,
which then trigger the fibroblasts or collagen-producing cells, that in turn
help heal the skin and plump up problem areas.




Q & A:


How does this
compare to topicals: The
iDerma Facial Beautification System is a one-time investment that treats the
underlying cause rather than temporarily and 
superficially improving the skin's appearance.
Do you need to use the included iDerma serum for the light therapy mask to work?The iDerma LED Mask is effective and will produce positive results independent of any serums or creams.
How long should I
use this?After the initial eight-week treatment period, a maintenance program ensures long-lasting
results from the iDerma Facial Beautification System. We suggest treating once
or twice per week or as needed.
How long does it
take to see results?For
some users, the skin looks and feels improved after several treatments;
smoother and more hydrated, skin takes on a natural radiant glow. Individual results will
vary. The average user will show the most benefit after the initial eight-week
treatment period.
What is an LED
Facial?  
An LED Facial is a technology-based skin treatment that uses specific wavelengths of
natural light energy to restore skin’s normal, healthy
activity. 
How does it
work? The
energy delivered by the red and infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) enhances
cellular metabolism.  This in turn stimulates the body to build new
collagen, increase circulation, and improve the functioning of the lymphatic
system.  The result is younger, healthier-looking skin.  
Is there proof that
this technology works?  Clinical
studies, scientific and medical research, independent testing and patient
testimonials exist to prove the efficacy of light therapy. Research
conducted by NASA’s space program has proven that near-infrared LED light
therapy promotes wound healing and human tissue growth. 
Are there any
adverse effects from this treatment?  No. This treatment has no adverse reactions and no down-time.  LED-emitting devices are classified by the FDA as possessing
“non-significant risk” because they are completely safe and
possess no possibility of harm from over-exposure.  
Is the process
abrasive or painful?  No. LED treatment is a gentle, painless, safe, non-invasive and non-abrasive
treatment.  
What is the
recommended schedule for iDerma treatment?  

Recommended use for the
iDerma is 10 minutes three times per week for eight weeks followed by regular
maintenance of once or twice per week.
Is iDerma therapy a
good complement to other skin care treatments?  
Absolutely! It helps strengthen and rejuvenate the skin at a cellular
level so it amplifies the results achieved in any facial treatment.  
Can I put my
make-up back on immediately?  
Yes, there is no downtime with this treatment.  
Can I go out in the
sun after this treatment?  
Yes, the treatment does not increase photosensitivity.  It is recommended
that you apply a broad-spectrum UVA and UVB sunscreen every day. 
Sunscreen should be applied after every treatment.  
Does this work for
everyone?  
While almost everyone can benefit from the use of light therapy, these
treatments will have the greatest impact on skin with sluggish metabolism and
slow cellular activity showing visible signs of aging. 
Contraindications for light therapy include pregnancy and epilepsy,
photoallergy, and medications that cause light sensitivity (such as
Tetracycline). Also, if you are currently taking steroids or cortisone
injections, you should not receive light therapy.
I
am not sure iDerma will properly fit my head. Does the headband adjust?
The iDerma device is fully adjustable to accommodate a wide range of sizes, using
a dial adjustment to increase or decrease the diameter of the strap that
secures the visor to the head and face. To ensure optimum comfort and a fully customized
fit, the iDerma is also equipped with elastic foam cushioning pads that are
customer-applied.

<h3>Northern Michigan Community Response to Overdose film and discussion night is put together by locals who are very concerned about the community lack of awareness of overdose <em>and innovative strategies to prevent overdose.</em>
</h3>
<p>We have seen the impact of some of these strategies- such as take home naloxone, fixed site prescription disposal, and community generated awareness campaigns- in other locations.  Before another member of our community dies, we need to consider some of these effective strategies.  </p>
<p>So, we asked experts and affected parties from all over the state and country to take the time and join us for this event.  Everyone is taking time off work and has gotten here on their own dime.  <em>We are asking for contributions to help offset that cost.</em></p>
<h3>Here's a review of the problem:</h3>
<p>Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, causing more deaths than motor vehicle crashes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), overdose rates have increased roughly five-fold since 1990.The CDC attributes the rise in drug overdose deaths to a higher use of prescription painkillers and increasing numbers of overdoses of cocaine and prescription sedatives. In 2008, the most recent year for which data is available, the CDC reports 36,500 poisoning deaths in the United States.</p>
<p>Providing overdose prevention, recognition, and response education to drug users and their neighbors, friends, families, and the service providers who work with them is a harm reduction intervention that saves lives. Opioid overdoses are particularly amenable to intervention because risk factors are well-understood and there is a safe antidote - <strong>naloxone</strong>.</p>
<p>We think naloxone a really important part of the solution:</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted in 2010 by the Harm Reduction Coalition of known naloxone distribution programs, between 1996 and June 2010, a total of 53,339 individuals have been trained and given naloxone as a result of the work of programs the US. These 48 take-home naloxone programs, spread over 200+ sites in 15 US states, have received reports of 10,194 overdose reversals using naloxone.  <strong>Michigan had 3 programs, now it has 1, none are in Northern Michigan.</strong></p>
<h3>Other ways that you can get involved:</h3>
<p>Ask your local public health department about naloxone distribution programs- suggest that they begin one.  <a href=""http://overdoseprevention.blogspot.com/p/resources-on-overdose.html%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This is a website with good information</a></p>
<p>Talk with your doctor about prescribing naloxone.  S/he might not be familiar with the practice, but <a href=""http://prescribetoprevent.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here is a lot of good information for prescribers.</a> </p>
<p>Join (or start!) your local substance abuse task force</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Northern Michigan Community Response to Overdose film and discussion night is put together by locals who are very concerned about the community lack of awareness of overdose and innovative strategies to prevent overdose.

We have seen the impact of some of these strategies- such as take home naloxone, fixed site prescription disposal, and community generated awareness campaigns- in other locations.  Before another member of our community dies, we need to consider some of these effective strategies.  
So, we asked experts and affected parties from all over the state and country to take the time and join us for this event.  Everyone is taking time off work and has gotten here on their own dime.  We are asking for contributions to help offset that cost.
Here's a review of the problem:
Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, causing more deaths than motor vehicle crashes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), overdose rates have increased roughly five-fold since 1990.The CDC attributes the rise in drug overdose deaths to a higher use of prescription painkillers and increasing numbers of overdoses of cocaine and prescription sedatives. In 2008, the most recent year for which data is available, the CDC reports 36,500 poisoning deaths in the United States.
Providing overdose prevention, recognition, and response education to drug users and their neighbors, friends, families, and the service providers who work with them is a harm reduction intervention that saves lives. Opioid overdoses are particularly amenable to intervention because risk factors are well-understood and there is a safe antidote - naloxone.
We think naloxone a really important part of the solution:
According to a survey conducted in 2010 by the Harm Reduction Coalition of known naloxone distribution programs, between 1996 and June 2010, a total of 53,339 individuals have been trained and given naloxone as a result of the work of programs the US. These 48 take-home naloxone programs, spread over 200+ sites in 15 US states, have received reports of 10,194 overdose reversals using naloxone.  Michigan had 3 programs, now it has 1, none are in Northern Michigan.
Other ways that you can get involved:
Ask your local public health department about naloxone distribution programs- suggest that they begin one.  This is a website with good information
Talk with your doctor about prescribing naloxone.  S/he might not be familiar with the practice, but here is a lot of good information for prescribers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kelsey Hill Worley, and I'm a mother of three (4, 2, and 6 months) from Chattanooga, TN. I have very recently, through social networking, become aware of Epidermolysis Bullosa - The WORST disease you've NEVER heard of. As a mother, it shattered me to realize this disease exists, and that these children suffer as greatly as they do. It devestates me to see their parents and loved ones suffering, having to watch their children suffer. I decided I wanted to raise money for an organization that can help them - The Butterfly Fund. Please read about EB, so you can understand why these families need our help so desperately!!</p>
<p>Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). EB is a rare genetic skin disease (affecting only 1 out of 50,000 births). In this condition, there is a defect in the connective tissue of the skin and mucous membranes that causes the skin to be so fragile that the slightest friction, minor injury, heat, rubbing, or scratching causes severe blistering —inside (such as the mouth, stomach, esophagus) and outside the body. These blisters can cause serious, sometimes fatal problems, when they become infected. The systemic and repetitive nature of the blistering leads to blindness, swallowing and breathing difficulties, scarring, infection, disfigurement, disability and dehydration. Ultimately, such devastating effects can produce a high rate of mortality. In fact, 87% of babies born with one of the more severe forms of EB do not live more than 12 months. There is NO cure for this horrific disease. Sufferers of EB have compared the sores with third-degree burns. They live in unthinkable pain. <br/><br/> With skin as fragile as butterfly wings, EB patients are dubbed “Butterfly Children."" On the outside, physical wounds and limitations brought on by this disorder prevent them from normal daily activities enjoyed by other children. On the inside, their dreams are the same as any child who loves, plays, learns and grows despite the pain and impediment caused by their disease.<br/><br/> The following is what it’s like to be diagnosed with one of the more severe forms of EB:<br/><br/> Imagine… <br/><br/> •a child with painful wounds similar to burns covering most of his or her body.<br/> •having to wrap each tiny little infant finger with Vaseline gauze and then cover it with gauze to prevent the hand from scarring, webbing and contracting.<br/> •never being able to hold your child tight because if you did, their skin would blister or shear off.<br/> •a child who will never know what it’s like to run, skip or jump, or to play games with other children because even the slightest physical contact will injure his or her skin.<br/> •a child who screams out each time it is bathed because the water touching its open wounds creates incredible pain.<br/> •a diet of only liquids or soft foods because blistering and scarring occur in the esophagus.<br/> •an active baby with his knees soaked in blood from the normal act of crawling.<br/> •a teenager with stumps for hands, the affected fingers scarred/healed together.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For families affected by this disease, the suffering is endless. Not only are many of the families unable to afford the sheer cost of bandages just to maintain their children's livelihood, many of them also have to travel very far to receive the specialized procedures and care involved in fighting this disease. This can be unbearably expensive. That is what breaks my heart the most about this disease. Not only do these parents and loved ones have to watch their children suffer, but they ALSO have to deal with the anxiety of financial stress just to maintain the medical care necessary to keep their children alive! As if that weren't enough, there is little awareness about EB, so they often feel alone in their suffering, and desperate for support! These precious babies fight for their lives in constant pain - and their parents must muster up the strength to watch it and be strong every single day. No one deserves to suffer the way these innocent children and their families do - and no one is stronger than they are. They are true heroes!!! There is valuable research being done for the purpose of finding a cure. Until there is a cure, The Butterfly Fund is committed to helping these families! Donations are used to help these families with travel, accomodations, medical expenses, bandages and supplies, and any other needs they may have. Until there is a cure, our financial support can make things easier on these precious, suffering families! As a mother of three healthy children, I feel a deep responsibility to DO something!! Donate only $15 (or more) and you will receive a beautiful solid perfume-filled locket with a butterfly charm to remind you of your generosity! :) All you have to do is provide your name and address in the donation process. Will you help me help the Butterfly Babies?!</p>

</p><p><b>This is an update to our request. At first we were not sure of all the costs and what services I would qualify for but now we have a better idea. Our figure is now $12,000 and that would cover travel to a few locations in the US for holistic and dietary healing to deal with the chemo and radiation, and to learn how to prevent it from coming back. Thank you for all the donations received so far.</b></p><p>My
friends, I have recently been diagnosed with late Stage 3
Orophalyngeal Squamous cell carcinoma, a big word for cancer on the
base of my tongue, and with  <i>metastasis
to the lymph node</i>.
As you would expect, it was a big surprise. My head is swimming most
of the time with disbelief.</p><p>How did I find it? It just felt like I have a little something stuck in my throat, like a piece of bread. It is not visible so it usually if found in stage 3, like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
As
with most of us men, I thought nothing could ever or would ever
happen to me so… I didn’t take care of myself as I should have, didn't excercise and t didn’t have
adequate insurance. We do have government insurance here in Japan but
it we have to pay for the procedures and visits first, then submit to
the city and hope they repay us the full amount. It is a blessing
that my wife, Kumiko works in insurance and she had me get a
hospitalization policy that will pay us $50/day for every day I’m
am in the hospital, but nothing for outpatient procedures. And, they also pay us back after we have paid for the stay. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
The
cancer has metastasized (spread) to the lymph node so the seriousness
is stepped up. It is a feeling I’ve never had before. I would like
to just run away but it’s like trying to run from your shadow.
We’ve all seen our kids do that, it doesn’t work. If it was just
me, I wouldn’t ask for any help but I’ve got a wife and 3 kids.
Brian, the oldest just finished college, Matt is 18, last year of
High School and wants to go to college, Lisa, 17, Junior, wants to be
a veterinarian. So pride set aside, here I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I’ve
done loads of research and my wife, Kumiko and I have decided to
proceed with the radiation/chemo as the doctors suggested. The
surgery is much too extensive and as the tumor is in my throat, I
don’t have time to fight it with alternative medicine. As much as
we hate the idea (thank you for all the loving advice we have
received and all the eye opening information provided) we don’t
want to, and feel we cannot delay the chemo. I will receive in
patient treatment commencing the 26th of August for 35 days over 7
weeks, that’s the plan. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
In
Japan, our government health insurance covers much but you have to
pay the bills up front, then submit them to your local court house
for evaluation and reimbursement. The cost is not too high, but with
all the testing and continual appointments, and as I will basically
be out of work for 2 months or more, our savings are quickly being
eaten up.</p><p>We are also looking into alternative follow up procedures to offset the effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments and to prevent reoccurrences.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
After
all is said and done, the reoccurrence is a possibility as is
development of other cancers from the radiation and chemotherapy. I
will overcome this situation and I will beat this cancer! We are
looking at a few clinics and other alternative methods, all of which
cost, and I will be out of work 2 months or more. Sadly, the
hospitals will not accept love in leu of payment. Any donation,
whether big or small is greatly appreciated. I humbly thank you, as
does my family, for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>
Who
am I?</b> (For those of you who don’t know me personally)</p>
<p>
I
am from Elyria, Ohio, from a large, supportive and loving family.
Right out of High School I joined the US Marine and got stationed
here in Okinawa where I met a cute girl who stole my heart.</p>
<p>
Living
on a small island, I have done every kind of work imaginable. I
currently independently operate a tilt bed tow truck. Business is
good at times, feast or famine. Anyone in sales can relate. It keeps
the bills paid.</p>
<p>
I
am also an independent distributor for Life Vantage, building that in
Japan and the US.</p>
<p>
Kumiko
and I have been married for 26 years and she has always been there
for me. God only knows how much she put up with over the years. We
have 3 beautiful, intelligent (sometimes trying) kids. The oldest,
Brian, has just finished college, Matthew, a Senior in High School is
just trying to figure out what school he wants to attend, and that
changes every few weeks. And Lisa, our 17 year old Junior, wants to
go to Veterinarian school.</p>
<p><b>
What
Am I asking for?</b></p>
<p>
The donations we are asking for are to help with the cost of eradicating the
cancer and preventing it from returning. We do have Japanese Government Health Insurance but we have
to pay first and then they reimburse the cost, minus our co-pay.</p>
<p>
Reoccurrence
is an ever-present risk, especially for this cancer since it has
metastasized to the lymph node. At present it is just in one, but the
lymph system is all interconnected, like the internet.</p>
<p>
We
are looking at a few different clinics that deal with the radiation
and chemotherapy, both which are known to result in other cancers
later on down the road. With a small island, the choices for quality
care are limited so our quest will lead me off Okinawa.</p>
<p>
The
money raised with help with travel, accommodations treatment away from home. I am going to go to the United States to seek holistic and dietary help for about 3 months.</p>
<p>
What
ever funds you lovingly donate will determine the course of action
that we will be able to pursue.</p>
<p><b>
Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>
I
am hoping to make the best choices concerning my recovery and
continued health to keep this cancer in check. I want to see my kids
grow and have kids. Isn't that every father's wish? That is why I'm
asking for your help.</p>
<p>
Some
people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Your support, love and prayers are requested, also. You can also
share my plight with others. Please remember to use the Indiegogo
share tools!</p>
<p>Sadly,
the hospitals will not accept love in leu of payment. Any donation,
whether big or small is greatly appreciated. I humbly thank you, as
does my family, for your help.</p></div>","This is an update to our request. At first we were not sure of all the costs and what services I would qualify for but now we have a better idea.

hospitalization policy that will pay us $50/day for every day I’m
am in the hospital, but nothing for outpatient procedures. And, they also pay us back after we have paid for the stay. 


The
cancer has metastasized (spread) to the lymph node so the seriousness
is stepped up. It is a feeling I’ve never had before. I would like
to just run away but it’s like trying to run from your shadow.
We’ve all seen our kids do that, it doesn’t work. If it was just
me, I wouldn’t ask for any help but I’ve got a wife and 3 kids.
Brian, the oldest just finished college, Matt is 18, last year of
High School and wants to go to college, Lisa, 17, Junior, wants to be
a veterinarian. So pride set aside, here I am.


I’ve
done loads of research and my wife, Kumiko and I have decided to
proceed with the radiation/chemo as the doctors suggested. The
surgery is much too extensive and as the tumor is in my throat, I
don’t have time to fight it with alternative medicine. As much as
we hate the idea (thank you for all the loving advice we have
received and all the eye opening information provided) we don’t
want to, and feel we cannot delay the chemo. I will receive in
patient treatment commencing the 26th of August for 35 days over 7
weeks, that’s the plan. 


In
Japan, our government health insurance covers much but you have to
pay the bills up front, then submit them to your local court house
for evaluation and reimbursement. The cost is not too high, but with
all the testing and continual appointments, and as I will basically
be out of work for 2 months or more, our savings are quickly being
eaten up.We are also looking into alternative follow up procedures to offset the effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments and to prevent reoccurrences.


After
all is said and done, the reoccurrence is a possibility as is
development of other cancers from the radiation and chemotherapy. I
will overcome this situation and I will beat this cancer! We are
looking at a few clinics and other alternative methods, all of which
cost, and I will be out of work 2 months or more. Sadly, the
hospitals will not accept love in leu of payment. Any donation,
whether big or small is greatly appreciated. I humbly thank you, as
does my family, for your help.


Who
am I? (For those of you who don’t know me personally)

I
am from Elyria, Ohio, from a large, supportive and loving family.
Right out of High School I joined the US Marine and got stationed
here in Okinawa where I met a cute girl who stole my heart.

Living
on a small island, I have done every kind of work imaginable. I
currently independently operate a tilt bed tow truck. Business is
good at times, feast or famine. Anyone in sales can relate. It keeps
the bills paid.

I
am also an independent distributor for Life Vantage, building that in
Japan and the US.

Kumiko
and I have been married for 26 years and she has always been there
for me. God only knows how much she put up with over the years. We
have 3 beautiful, intelligent (sometimes trying) kids. The oldest,
Brian, has just finished college, Matthew, a Senior in High School is
just trying to figure out what school he wants to attend, and that
changes every few weeks. And Lisa, our 17 year old Junior, wants to
go to Veterinarian school.

What
Am I asking for?

The donations we are asking for are to help with the cost of eradicating the
cancer and preventing it from returning. We do have Japanese Government Health Insurance but we have
to pay first and then they reimburse the cost, minus our co-pay.

Reoccurrence
is an ever-present risk, especially for this cancer since it has
metastasized to the lymph node. At present it is just in one, but the
lymph system is all interconnected, like the internet.

We
are looking at a few different clinics that deal with the radiation
and chemotherapy, both which are known to result in other cancers
later on down the road. With a small island, the choices for quality
care are limited so our quest will lead me off Okinawa.

The
money raised with help with travel, accommodations treatment away from home. I am going to go to the United States to seek holistic and dietary help for about 3 months.

What
ever funds you lovingly donate will determine the course of action
that we will be able to pursue.

Other
Ways You Can Help

I
am hoping to make the best choices concerning my recovery and
continued health to keep this cancer in check. I want to see my kids
grow and have kids. Isn't that every father's wish? That is why I'm
asking for your help.

Some
people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Your support, love and prayers are requested, also. You can also
share my plight with others. Please remember to use the Indiegogo
share tools!
Sadly,
the hospitals will not accept love in leu of payment. Any donation,
whether big or small is greatly appreciated. I humbly thank you, as
does my family, for your help.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>INSPIRATION – WHY DID I CREATE THESE PRODUCTS</b></p>
<p>After my first child was born I found myself without any
sort of fitness program and didn’t know what to do.  Even as a former professional ballet, Broadway and Radio
City Rockette dancer as well as a Pilates instructor, the conventional ways of
working weren’t working for me.  I
even lived next door to the gym but still couldn’t get there.  I realized there was a gap in fitness
products available.  I started
incorporating strength training into my existing beauty routine and realized being healthy and strong can become as routine as brushing my teeth.  </p>
<p>Athletes train throughout the day in order to stay in shape and improve their skills.  I thought, why not create
products that help others awaken their inner athlete.  Micro changes on a daily basis create macro results.  My goal is for everyone to feel the
benefits of lengthening and strengthening their muscles without taking any time
out of their busy day.  My goal is to eliminate the obstacles and excuses we all have to getting and staying healthy. 
If you brush your teeth you can work out.  If you sit at your desk you can work out.  This is how the Fitness Flower dream
began. </p>

<h3>STOP THE SUFFERING OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER</h3>
<h3>Toxic drug and radiation treatments for cancer don't have to be the only choices!</h3>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">We have a better and nontoxic way!</span><br/></p>

<p>Skidmore College Professor Anthony Holland discovered a new nontoxic way to destroy cancer cells using oscillating pulsed electric fields (OPEF), astounding the cancer experts, <em>but because this new method does not use toxic drugs , it's impossible to move the research work forward without your help! <em>[Big Pharma supports most cancer research which is based on finding the next toxic drug that can be patented!]</em></em></p>
<p><em>We are at a critical juncture in our research work and not one penny you give will go toward administrative expenses because all of our laboratory workers are volunteers, dedicated to developing what we believe will be the cancer therapy of the future!</em></p>
<h3>Help us break the stranglehold BIG PHARMA has over truly innovative cancer research by helping us purchase vital laboratory equipment!</h3>
<h2><strong><em><a href=""http://www.thecuredocumentary.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See Part of The Documentary Film-in-progress about our work entitled ""The Cure"" (click here to watch)</a></em></strong></h2>
<p>In 2009-10, I was invited to work for four months in a major cancer research laboratory in Philadelphia (Thomas Jefferson University Medical School [TJU], Department of Surgical Research) to test a theory I had that oscillating pulsed electric fields (OPEF) could destroy cancer cells.</p>

<h3>The top cancer experts in the lab were utterly astonished when my experiments worked and killed 30% of cancerous leukemia cells in repeated experiments!  Their top lab techs also noted we had slowed the growth of the cancer by as much as 60%. They'd never seen anything like it!</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The cancer experts said: <em>""if this had been a multimillion dollar drug developed by 'Big Pharma', this would have been considered a 'home run'!""</em></span> But this discovery was funded out of pocket by Professor Holland personally, not by a large grant or organization, AND because it is not a drug based method to kill cancer cells, there is a kind of 'Berlin Wall' we cannot break through to continue our cancer research.  </h3>
<p>BIG PHARMA supplies hundreds of millions of dollars to major cancer research centers around the world to develop ever more toxic drugs that leave the patient almost wishing for death, but no funding for small companies that have discovered a non drug approach to cancer, so we are turning to you, the public, to help us break Big Pharma's stranglehold over truly innovative cancer research!</p>

<h3>Team Malaysia </h3>
<p>After successfully hosting the first Asian Quidditch Cup in 2016, co-founders Andrew and Charmaine set their sights on the biggest premier quidditch tournament of them all: World Cup. The odds were against them because of the distance, currency strength, and a limited number of team members but they were determined to accomplish this feat anyway.</p>
<p>Fast forward almost two years and they've gotten themselves enough players, several coaches, and a little bit of money. They just need <i>your</i> help in the last leg of the race to ensure that <strong>every</strong> player who has been training hard for the past year can make it.</p>
<p>This team gives respite to its players from all walks of life. World Cup has been a goal we've been working hard towards and it would be absolutely heartbreaking if money was what stopped us after we have gotten this far.</p>
<p>Help make our dreams come true!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>The team consists of students and people who only recently started working. The average monthly salary is RM3000 (632 Euros). We have been hosting events to fundraise but alot of that money has been used for the team and player fees. Here's the cost breakdown of what is left:</p>
<ul>
<li>A return flight: RM2800 (728 USD or 588 Euros) </li>
<li>Staying in the village for the entirety of the tournament: RM1161 (305 USD or 245 Euros) per person</li>
</ul>
<p>But of course, we wouldn't ask for money in exchange for nothing which is why we have exciting perks in store like our jersey! More are coming soon. </p>

<h3>In Case You Were Wondering...</h3>
<p>We understand the community's hesitation to donate, because what if we can't make it after all that? Allow us to ease your worries:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't need visas, so money is truly the only issue (yay diplomacy)</li>
<li>We are scattered across the globe so our 8 US, UK &amp; Canada-based players (many of whom have already purchased tickets) will definitely be there to represent regardless of the outcome of this fundraiser</li>
</ul>
<p>The matter at hand is whether the 11 locally-based Malaysians who have been training weekly and fundraising at every opportunity will be able to make it. Our players have been scrimping and saving so they can afford the flight but not the accommodation for the entire duration of the World Cup, so every little bit helps. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>History Has Its Eyes On You </h3>
<p>By supporting our journey to World Cup, you'd play a role in the development of quidditch in Malaysia. Attending World Cup would be a major milestone that would put us on the map as well as attract more players, perhaps even enough to create a second team in the country. Additionally, it would help develop quidditch in Asia as a whole, as Malaysia is one of the only 4 Asian teams sending a team to World Cup. </p>

<h3>My name is Mark Purser, I am a student and teacher of yoga seeking to establish a groovy little bamboo yoga studio at the edge of the forest in Byron Bay Australia.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I have been studying and practicing yoga for a very long time, nearly 20 years, and have long held a dream to create a cool little space to share that love with other people.  I have recently returned to my home in Byron Bay to follow this dream and have been extremely lucky to be given the opportunity to build something in an amazing place close to the CBD in Byron - yet tucked away at the edge of the forest.<br/><br/>With the help of some amazing friends, we have come a long way. My friend and uber-architect Joe Oid has designed an incredible space using bamboo for construction and my yoga buddy Matt Foy, Joe and I have been cracking away over the last few weeks building it.<br/><br/>We have come a long way and hope to be finished the main frame of the construction before Christmas - but the funds are running really low and we would love some of your love to help us get the Tentple finished in early 2017.<br/> </p>
<p>We need money to finish the construction and do some landscaping as well as furnish the studio with a fancy cork floor and some curtains, cushions and matts for all of our amazing yogis to sit upon.<br/><br/>This is a low budget, no frills, honest as they come endeavour. Just a few friends who are passionate about sharing their love of meditation and yoga, pooling their resources and creating something really cool for others to enjoy.<br/><br/>As a yoga teacher setting our on my career, establishing this space is a big step. I've invested nearly $10,000 of my own money thus far, and have committed to spend more, but my own funds are running very low - and would really appreciate your assistance in getting this project across the line.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Your investment can be redeemed</strong> in the form of credit against any yoga classes or courses that I run here in Byron or anywhere else in the world, at any time in the next 10 years. Or if you don't chose to redeem the credit yourself, you can pass the voucher onto a friend who may utilise it, or you can let me know and I will make that credit available to someone in the local community who can't afford to pay for yoga themselves.</p>

</div>My name is
Verónica Arana and I am from Managua, Nicaragua. I studied contem- porary dance
professionally. I also studied dance as a therapy modality called “Psicodanza” and
I have been working on this for more than 15 years. In my country, without
costs, I have served children and teenage victims of sexual abuse, those with developmental
challenges such as Down’s syndrome and autism, and the vision impaired as well.
With a sense of humility and by helping others I feel guided by God.<br/><br/>
<p>The results for
these children have been AMAZING. And this has been a great source of joy
for their parents throughout the years. The last work of this nature was done
as a training session for the psychiatrists, nurses, social workers and
psychologists of the Psychosocial Nicaraguan Hospital, in Managua, to help them
implement this therapy with their in-patient clients.</p>
<p>I
truly believe that God gives us all special gifts and for this reason I wrote a
book that will help “differently-abled” children and their families to achieve
autonomy, responsible independence, and a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>A book on “Psicodanza” and its practice does
not otherwise exist in Central America. This book will provide effective and easy-to-understand
explanations of dance-therapy for children with special needs. This way the
child will learn with all of his or her senses. For me, publishing this book
will be a personal realization and an offering to Humanity; my gift for every child
and their family.</p>
<p><i>Your contribution</i> is going to help much more than

<p>Health access is very limited in remote regions of the Peruvian Amazon.  In addition to the environmental barriers to health access, most rural citizens in this area of the Rainforest cannot afford to travel long distances to find care, let alone purchase any continued care if and when a diagnosis is made.  Project Amazonas is a non-governmental organization that has been providing greatly needed care with mobile clinics to several of these communities over the last couple decades. MGY, a non-profit organization that has been working to develop sustainable health education and training with mobile health programs, is teaming up with Project Amazons to implement a community co-developed program based on the needs assessment of four rural communities in the Loreto Region: Santo Tomas, Santa Ursula, Comandancia, and Nuevo Israel. </p>
<p>MGY’s training program will do more than simply supply health workers in the region with waterproof equipment bags, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, watches, computer tablets, and certain medications.  It will develop and provide a multifaceted skill set for health workers with limited health resources which we hope will spread like wildfire.  The training will begin with courses on the tablets for the Health Workers (one from each community) to watch in Peruvian Spanish. By the end of the week of training, the training videos will be re-rerecorded with the Health Workers new or refined skills, creating a database of health videos for the Health Workers to begin accumulating as they will train the next four communities six months later.  </p>
<p>Computer tablets will serve multiple functions in addition to providing sustainable health education for continual education and new education for communities in the field.  The tablets will serve functions for disease surveillance, step-by-step health protocols, and as a resource to collect basic health information. Using an open-source disease surveillance application created by ICT-Edge, MGY has developed a similar disease surveillance application which will allow Health Workers to collect data over time and store it to the cloud. The cloud will automatically sync when a connection (via weekly travel to an internet source) is present.  Starting with basic surveillance guiding protocols, part of the training will include assessing and recording vitals signs, logging each step on the tablet, and following guided messages based on input such as ""perform malaria assay"" after vital signs demonstrate recurring intermittent high fever for several days.</p>
<p>This training program and plan has been developed based on community-based research which included introducing technology to these communities. Although most community members had seen a computer, most have never used one.  As MGY suspected, training with mobile health technology was not difficult, and always incredibly engaging. The use of technology in training will not be a barrier, but will serve as the catalyst to amplify educational programs created by communities themselves in very remote regions.</p>
<p>The week of Thanksgiving 2014, a team of medical students, dental students, physicians, water resource experts, and IT/computer experts traveled to the Amazon to live at Project Amazonas' biological station with the health workers to provide free training and equipment. The water and dental teams worked with the communities to assess how they wished to proceed in order to provide more accessible drinking water and improved oral health over the next few years. </p>
<p>This Thanksgiving 2015 the team will travel to the Project Amazonas' site again to assess the progress of the training videos and retention of material from previous visits by the community healthcare workers. The team will provide more and updated training videos for the community healthcare workers to use. Please be part of our project and donate.  We cannot do this alone.  100% of donations will go to the health worker training program. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

</p><p>According to statistics released by the National Safety Council (NSC),
There were 36,200 fatal traffic accidents in 2012, with more than half of these
accidents being caused by driver fatigue. One commonly unperceived cause
of driver fatigue is the poor indoor air quality in the vehicles. It is
commonly known that factors such as industrial pollution and CO2 emission have been
deteriorating air quality around us. Viruses such as SARS, H1N1, tuberculosis,
pneumonia, and influenza survive longer in confined spaces like vehicles and
offices. They can be easily spread and transmitted through the air and it is
difficult to eliminate viruses due to the very small size. A virus has a far
smaller volume than bacterium - most viruses measure 0.3 microns in diameter -
sothe virus particle may be inhaled and easily attached to cells in your body.
Moreover, 275 kinds of chemicals are found in new cars. Inside a hot idle
vehicle, the concentration of chemical pollutants from interior decorations,
such as TVOC, formaldehyde, benzene, etc., can reach more than 10 times higher
than the safe level. Some volatile organic compounds including formaldehyde and
benzene, which volatilize from carpet, rubber gasket and perfume, belong to
Class A carcinogen, and can cause a lot of damages to human health, especially
to those who are vulnerable (e.g., young children, pregnant women, and people
with chronic health conditions).</p>

enable you to have the ability to check the air quality in your vehicle anytime
and from anywhere by using AIRAPP in your smart phone. It can automatically turn
on when reaching poor air quality level. AIRSOD can also monitor relevant data
of oxygen content, temperature, humidity, formaldehyde, dust, etc. Furthermore,
it can remove harmful gas, second-hand smoke, pollen, odor, bacteria,
formaldehyde, benzene, volatile organic compound, virus, and other harmful
particles. It is a silent guarding angel in your vehicle. When
a shortage of oxygen occurs inside the vehicle, it will alert you to open the
window for ventilation. This will help to prevent driver fatigue and avoid accidents.
Additionally, when the air quality is low, the smart air purifier will
automatically get to work, creating a clean and refreshing environment for you.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/740187/files/20140724021557-7.jpg?1406193357"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/740192/files/20140724021836-icon.jpg?1406193516"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/></p><br/><p>As a novel and compact mobile

be set on half an hour before your regular driving time, so that you can enjoy
clean and refreshing air when you enter the car.</p>
<p>The third is the automatic mode.
The smart sensor in AIRSOD will automatically detect the air quality in your

We advocate environmental protection and call for the halt
of hunting. We want to make some contribution to the protection of the earth,
and that is exactly the reason we create the AIRSOD smart air purifier, which consumes

According to statistics released by the National Safety Council (NSC),
There were 36,200 fatal traffic accidents in 2012, with more than half of these
accidents being caused by driver fatigue. One commonly unperceived cause
of driver fatigue is the poor indoor air quality in the vehicles. It is
commonly known that factors such as industrial pollution and CO2 emission have been
deteriorating air quality around us. Viruses such as SARS, H1N1, tuberculosis,
pneumonia, and influenza survive longer in confined spaces like vehicles and
offices. They can be easily spread and transmitted through the air and it is
difficult to eliminate viruses due to the very small size. A virus has a far
smaller volume than bacterium - most viruses measure 0.3 microns in diameter -
sothe virus particle may be inhaled and easily attached to cells in your body.
Moreover, 275 kinds of chemicals are found in new cars. Inside a hot idle
vehicle, the concentration of chemical pollutants from interior decorations,
such as TVOC, formaldehyde, benzene, etc., can reach more than 10 times higher
than the safe level. Some volatile organic compounds including formaldehyde and
benzene, which volatilize from carpet, rubber gasket and perfume, belong to
Class A carcinogen, and can cause a lot of damages to human health, especially
to those who are vulnerable (e.g., young children, pregnant women, and people
with chronic health conditions).

Through nearly two years of
research and development, hundreds of experiments, and dozens of design
modifications, this mobile smart air purifier has been developed. We are very
proud to say, it is the world’s first mobile smart air purifier.Our product – AIRSOD - will
enable you to have the ability to check the air quality in your vehicle anytime
and from anywhere by using AIRAPP in your smart phone. It can automatically turn
on when reaching poor air quality level. AIRSOD can also monitor relevant data
of oxygen content, temperature, humidity, formaldehyde, dust, etc. Furthermore,
it can remove harmful gas, second-hand smoke, pollen, odor, bacteria,
formaldehyde, benzene, volatile organic compound, virus, and other harmful
particles. It is a silent guarding angel in your vehicle. When
a shortage of oxygen occurs inside the vehicle, it will alert you to open the
window for ventilation. This will help to prevent driver fatigue and avoid accidents.
Additionally, when the air quality is low, the smart air purifier will
automatically get to work, creating a clean and refreshing environment for you.As a novel and compact mobile
smart air purifier, AIRSOD can be placed anywhere inside your vehicle. Its
solar panel will quietly charge itself, and the environment will be kept clean constantly.
Unlike traditional on-board devices with 
annoying charging lines, this whole device
is a size of a piece of A4 paper, and can be put in various places within your
vehicle as well as other common places such as your handbag, on your desk, or in
a bathroom.AIRSOD can be controlled through
AIRAPP, and several modes are available:The first mode is especially made
for cars. In the car mode, AIRSOD will automatically turn on when you start the
car’s engine. And the mode will be automatically shut
down 10 minutes after the car engine stops.
The second is the set schedule
mode, specially designed for those who drive on a set schedule. The device can
be set on half an hour before your regular driving time, so that you can enjoy
clean and refreshing air when you enter the car.
The third is the automatic mode.
The smart sensor in AIRSOD will automatically detect the air quality in your
environment. When low oxygen content is detected, it will automatically raise
the alarm to remind you to open the window for ventilation. Poor air quality
can immediately trigger to start its operation.AIRAPP FOR CARPLAY
Through IOS CARPLAY, AIRAPP can display air quality information in your car,
enabling you to check and control your air quality similar to controlling the
air conditioner and music in your car.Furthermore, AIRSOD contains GPS
positioning. The device in your car can easily help you locate your car. The
location of your car can be easily found by checking the APP.AIRAPP also has a fun sharing
feature. The app allows you to share your surrounding information on various
social media platforms.
1. HAF material with 3M large
throughput of air filtered
The first is multiple filtrations
based on the electrostatic electret technology. Permanently static electricity
prevents the adhesion of bacteria. Through multiple filtrations, more than 70% of various particles
can be removed.
2. HEPA filter
The second is precision
filtration, which can powerfully remove 99% of the fine particles with diameter
of above 0.01 microns in the air, such as PM2.5, smoke, pollen, acarid, etc.
3. HAAC cellular materials
The third filtration can
efficiently absorb harmful gases, including formaldehyde, benzene series and
other volatile organic compounds, in order to create fresh and clean air.Benefits for Choosing AIRSOD

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi friends! I'm Serena Scanzillo and own my traveling personal training business called LEAN ON ME: Personalized Fitness &amp; Health out of Washington, DC. I meet with small groups, individuals, teens, new moms and athletes to focus on their nutrition and fresh ways to approach working out. I started LEAN ON ME in November of 2008 and have since gained a strong following in the Northern VA area...however, being as passionate as I am about fixing the nationwide obesity epidemic; my goal is to reach a much larger audience. 'The question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop 
me.'</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""slide-title""><em>Obesity is the plague of the 21st century. </em>Approximately 72.5 million American adults are 
obese. <em>People have got to take the initiative. </em>Annual medical costs of obesity are as high as $147 Billion. On average,
 obese people have medical costs that are $1429 more than medical costs 
of normal weight people. The US is also the biggest Big Mac consumer in the world. The list goes on and on. You've heard these facts before, over and over. It's redundant and depressing, I know.  If you're one of these people who help make up such staggering stats, then please help me, to help you. The truth is whatever you're doing now, may not be working so let your visions become reality and get yourself where you want to be. LEAN ON ME has the potential to reach thousands, even millions with the right funding and team collaboration. My approach is fresh, invigorating, and new. This could be huge.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm starting this campaign as an attempt to become the solution for 
overweight teens and adults by offering them more--fitness on the go phone applications, 
extra gear, closer nutritional tracking, food tasting demos, facility rentals, 
transportation, equipment, program development, and motivational treats/prizes. 
It costs a lot to provide clients with the necessary things to help them lose as much weight as possible and get a solid foot off the ground, once they've met their goals. Maintenance is huge and is often the hardest part of the weight-loss journey. <br/></p>
<p>I need the funding to ensure people that LEAN ON ME is truly a company one can turn to, in desperate times. We're not talking funding for treadmills, punching bags and spin bikes to be put in a generic gym. We're taking money to give you tools to make your work-out YOUR OWN, in any location. Tools to make your work out challenging, real and effective. Tools to make better choices in the kitchen and tools to reinvent your life.<br/></p>
<p>It's not going to be easy, but I'm extremely determined to get LEAN ON ME on the map and into the homes of families/individuals that have nowhere to turn, no support to implement a fitness plan and no motivation to get up and out. There is an answer. There is a way to get America back on track. There is a life out there that each and every person deserves to live. It starts today. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Plattsburg High School’s Class of 1995 has come together, 17 years later, to rally around our friend and former classmate, Jodi Brown.  Jodi was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and has recently started her challenging path to a full recovery.  As you may know, cancer treatments are the most expensive medical treatments in the United States.   Not only is the financial burden overwhelming but the physical and emotional toll this disease takes requires so much more than money can buy.  Thankfully, Jodi is a strong and resilient person and she is the only person who will win the battle ahead of her. </p>
<p>This page is to help gather our resources as a class and as a community to hopefully provide some financial relief to Jodi and her son, Carter.  As expected, Jodi has already missed a lot of work for doctor and treatment appointments and there is more to come.  As a healthy single mother, keeping up with a 2 ½ year old son is an already demanding and rewarding job.  Our goal is to help alleviate a fraction of stress from this experience so she can better focus on her recovery, and most importantly, her son.  </p>

<p><strong>Meet Scott Spence</strong></p>
<p>Imagine.  You have worked your whole life, even while enduring painful treatment for bladder cancer which is the most expensive cancer to fight because it reoccurs 100% of the time.  Throughout this ordeal, you see medical bills growing faster than you can pay them, and watch hopelessly as you deplete your savings accounts and sell your house hoping to stay ahead of creditors.</p>
<p>For Scott Spence, losing these material possessions was not important. Scott knew he had all he really needed--his wonderful wife and family, many terrific friends, his job as a kitchen designer, and most importantly, his health.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Scott received the devastating news that a growth on his chest is malignant melanoma.  Fortunately, he has found terrific doctors in Spokane willing to operate on Tuesday, June 26, and also provide follow-up treatment.  However, Scott and his family need to pay for this medical care, and do not currently qualify for any government assistance—because Scott works!</p>
<p>Scott’s friends and family are raising money through donations and fundraisers, and we hope you will be a part of this campaign to save his life. Elton John expresses our feelings for Scott best in “Your Song”--how wonderful life is while you're in the world.  His friends and family will do everything possible to help Scott survive this latest battle with cancer.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Scott and his family are devout Christians, and they have the support and prayers of a very large community.  While they appreciate this support, simply put, they are in dire need of cash to pay their medical expenses.</p>
<p>They are uncertain of the overall costs for treatment, so we have set an initial goal of $5,000, although the costs will likely be much higher.  All monies raised will go directly to the doctors.</p>

<p>We would appreciate it if you shared this page and Scott's story with as many people as possible. Please use this site's sharing capabilities to spread the word about our campaign to raise funds for Scott's medical expenses.

</div>Hello everyone, my name is Tonya and I am 32 years old. I live im Ozark,
 Missouri. I am in dire need of a surgery that will save my life.  It is
 the gastric sleeve weight loss surgery. I have been big all my life and
 I have been on so many diets. None have worked. I have very bad fluid 
build up all over my body and carrying that around makes it almost 
impossible for me to breathe. My knees and back are very bad as well. I 
can not do simple things such as bathing, cleaning, and walking. The 
right side of my stomach is so full of fluid that I can't reach to keep 
myself clean. I can't raise my arm because of fluid as well. I have been
 to doctors and they all agree that this surgery will save my life and 
will take care of the fluid and excruciating pain I endure every single 
day. After I get myself healthy, I plan on going back to school because I
 really want to work in the health industry.  I have insurance but I owe
 a past bill of 4000.00 and until I get that paid, they won't touch me 
even though this is life threatening. I can provide whatever else that 
is needed as proof of this. I have pictures and anything else you may 
need. Thank you so much.<p></p></div>","Hello everyone, my name is Tonya and I am 32 years old. I live im Ozark,

<h3>Long Story Short</h3>
<p>Over the past couple years I have noticed numbness in my feet as well as excruciating pain shooting through them, this is caused by Diabetic Neuropathy, which means my veins have constricted making it difficult for oxygen and nutrients to reach my nerves, specifically in my feet, though it has effected other areas to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>Any of you that know me also know that I have never had much money, and have had medical bills stacking up the past 9 years with no sign of them going away. Add to it the fact that I have no insurance, have to buy my diabetes meds out of pocket, food, gas, and other amenities to maintain a typical life. I can't ask family for help because no one is in a position financially to contribute what I need due to the many hardships we have faced the past 6 years. This is my last resort, I don't expect anyone to throw huge amounts of money into this, I just pray that I can get some sort of help, any help at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>My goal is $2000, that number will at least take care of doctors appointments and meds until such a time that I need any procedure done. I'm not out to get everything taken care of by others, just a helping hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many of you know how much my family means to me, and I would love to see my nephews get the same from me that my niece has had the past 13 years. I want them to have the opportunity to have their uncle pick them up and wrestle with them, carry them around when they're tired, and sneak them a cookie from a cabinet they can't reach. I really just want them to share in the joy they give me everyday just by having them around.</p>
<p>Another reason I desperately need your help, I want to be a chef. I know of blind chefs, chefs missing hands or fingers, but I have never heard of a wheelchair bound chef. It can't be done, you have to be able to move in the kitchen and be able to reach things on the stove, grill, shelves, etc. I've been trying so hard to make my dream come true and this could be the death of it. If you'd like to see what I can do, make a donation, I will be glad to make you dinner and dessert as a thank you for what you have done for me</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Pass this page around to people that may be inclined to help, some moral support if you can't contribute, a kind word if I'm having a rough day, or if I'm fortunate enough to see you a smile or hug. I truly wish I had another way to thank you for anything that you may contribute aside from a heartfelt thank you, but sadly I don't have anything to give.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The new technology behind the Neuro-Synergy System is designed to bring the core Body/Mind control centers in the nervous system into a state of complete synergy and balance....a state called HOMEOSTASIS. Homeo: within myself, STASIS: zero stress and balance. Homeostasis is a foundation state of the body that <i>must be present</i> before the body can really heal. At the Center for Neuroacoustic Research we work directly with the most prominent 21st century dis-ease, a dis-ease which is silently robbing the majority of society of good health and wellness and is the baseline cause of most diseases in the developed world. It is -- <br/></p>
<p>                                            The Loss of Homeostasis! <br/></p>
<p>What's causing this loss of Homeostasis? STRESS! Our bodies were designed for a sprint not a marathon. Our present body was designed hundreds of thousands of years ago for a very different environment of stress then we now experience. What used to be waking with the sun, grabbing a spear and going out to chase breakfast (and that's your workday) has become a never-ending series of stress assaults on our body/mind....alarm clock / rushed breakfast / processed food / traffic jams / fumes / pollution / stressful job / never enough money / home after a long day / rushed microwaved dinner / evening news on TV (!!!) / kids,homework,etc / ever wonder why you can't sleep... and tomorrow is ""Rinse and Repeat""! <br/></p>
<p>The Neuro-Synergy System specializes in reducing stress to ZERO and re-training the stress handling centers of the body to return to normal function: HOMEOSTASIS.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The main control centers in the body use the state of Homeostasis to tell all the systems in the body what to do. This loss of the ability of the body to return to its core zero-stress state of Homeostasis, causes the main control centers in the nervous system to begin to lose control of the body. Our clinical research over the past 30 years has resulted in patented techniques for measuring Homeostasis in the nervous system and returning the system to a state of homeostasis-synergy using precisely tuned sound frequencies through the body as low frequency vibrations. The whole approach used in the Neuro-Synergy System is very complex, but the core approach is returning the master control systems of the body to the Homeostasis State of Neuro-Synergy. </span><br/></p>
<p><i>From Wikipedia:</i></p>
<p><b>Synergy</b> is the interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce an effect different from or greater than the sum of their individual effects. The term <i>synergy</i> comes from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greek</a> word <i>synergia</i>συνέργια from <i>synergos</i>, <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B3%CF%8C%CF%82"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">συνεργός</a>, meaning ""working together"".<br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS BEHIND THE NEURO-SYNERGY SYSTEM?</b></p>
<p>Neuro-Synergy Systems (NSS) is dedicated
to placing a clinically tested, high-tech holistic healing system into the main-stream healthcare market.The strength of NSS’s work lies in its foundation of over
two decades of scientific clinical research with thousands of patients and
volunteers using recognized medical monitoring systems that can show the benefits of this therapeutic approach in the brain, brainwaves and deep nervous system control centers of the body for a wide range of health conditions without the use of drugs or surgery. This testing and research has shown us which types of sounds, music, brainwave entrainment frequencies and primordial sounds work best generically for a new breed of ""Prescription Only"" healing soundtracks beneficial for the largest audience possible.</p>
<p><b>THE NEURO-SYNERGY SYSTEM IS PLACED - NOT SOLD</b></p>
<p>Yes, our business model for the Neuro-Synergy System is <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>a new paradigm</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for many.  It is  unique, whereby we are Not selling the Systems, thereby assisting Venue owners to enhance their practice or business by asking for no capital outlay to pay for the System. We Place and then Maintain the Systems in doctor's offices, hospitals, spas; nursing and residential facilities; gyms, fitness centers and athletic facilities; human resource and nursing departments for employees and in corporate offices at No Cost. We charge a small fee, not a percent, whenever an individual uses the System, however. <br/></p>
<p>We also electronically monitor the functionality of the System through the internet. If something appears to be a slowing down or not performing correctly we can fix it remotely if it is a software problem. If it is a hardware problem, our placement personnel come and switch out the faulty part or replace the whole system if necessary, at no cost to the Venue. <br/></p>
<p>We want to empower as many practitioners and businesses as possible to enhance and complement their service to those who need to re-gain or ""find"" their Neuro-Synergy so they can better heal and enjoy good health.  We want to reward the Venues by boosting their income by upwards to $3,000 a month with no additional cost to them, simply by using the System. And we want all to help spread this new holistic healing modality throughout the world. Society needs help.  We need your help. Can you / will you ""Pay the good received thus far in your life Forward""? We hope so!  Everyone can and will profit!<br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL HERE?</b></p>
<p>The goal of CNR is to bring to the
scientific community and to the public-at-large, a well-researched, safe,
non-invasive, intrinsically gentle but powerful modality for managing personal
health and well-being, and for personal growth and transformation, safe for all ages. This is accomplished
through Dr. Thompson’s clinically tested sound compositions  and it is with his scientifically engineered Neuro-Synergy
Sound Chairs and Tables aka System that we move toward our vision -- a vision of
individuals, and eventually the world, healthy and living its highest purpose –
living, working and playing from its center. </p>
<p><i>Our Motto: </i></p>
<p><u>“Healing Body * Heart * Mind and
Spirit through the Scientific Application of Sound”</u> .</p>

<p><b>MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEURO-SYNERGY SYSTEM:</b></p>
<p>The 
Neuro-Synergy System is an electronically operated reclining chair and high-tech audio programs of the world-renown Dr. Jeffrey Thompson. The chair is super comfy with its ultra-soft, ""green certified"" upholstery and pads. The hand controlled electronic reclining feature is easy to
operate and gently swings your body into the ""Zero-Gravity"" position
at the touch of a finger, soon to be automatic with a gentle touch, with our new chair and the added electronic feature. The patented Right/Left Split Chair design is a unique feature
of the Neuro-Synergy System, corresponding, as it does, to the structure and physiology of the human body -- so necessary to bring a body into a state of balance and homeostasis -- our goal.  <br/></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">EACH EXPERIENCE IS A <i>WOW!</i> EXPERIENCE...</b><br/></p>
<p>Dr. Thompson’s CDs are recognized world-wide
and used in clinics, hospitals, spas, residential facilities, meditation centers and Fortune 100 and 500 companies. These soundtracks have been clinically tested for helping the body achieve the Homeostasis State of maximum stress-reduction, relaxation, healing, growth, personal transformation,
expanded awareness, peak performance, etc. The Audio Programs ""on-board the Neuro-Synergy System"" have been
developed through decades of clinical research with thousands of patients and
volunteer visits. </p>
<p><b>THE SOUND PROTOCOLS</b></p>
<p>The custom soundtracks that are available through the Neuro-Synergy System are the ""Heart"" of the whole program. They are set up in a series of programs which take patients step-by-step to the goal of better health and wellness. The audio programs are arranged in a series of
what we call “Protocols”.  Each Protocol is specific for different conditions and for boosting certain brain
abilities. </p>
<p><b>SOME OF THE PROTOCOL SERIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:</b> </p>
<p>Relaxation / Stress
Reduction (for stress related conditions)</p>
<p>Heal / Repair (for speeding healing
of injuries, rehab and pain relief)</p>
<p>Comfort and Integrate (for trauma repair of all kind) </p>
<p>Creativity and Peak Performance (for rehab and athletes)</p>
<p>We even have a ""Rejuvenation"" Protocol for those who want a healthy ""re-charge"" in their busy day!  It only takes 10 minutes and is still a ""Wow"" experience. </p>
<p>Each protocol has six
soundtracks and is designed to be used in order over the course of a few weeks. It Is a high-tech, clinically tested way to help one build a foundation for healing and/or personal growth.  It is like going to a Gym on the Inside"".           <br/></p>

<p>Ed.Note: We receive many thank you e-mails as notes from grateful users of Dr. Thompson's work. I would like to share one we just received from an individual who is legally blind. In his words, ""<i>Just wanted to drop you a quick note about the healing process by using the Bio-tuning. -- As you are aware, I struggle with a vision loss because of corneal scarring on both of the cornea’s, but I can still make out the Big E on he eye chart.  -- </i><i>Since using the Delta 1 and Delta 2 cd’s, the physical repair of the eye has been quite significant.  I can now make out the two lines following the Big E in both eyes.  No other medical intervention has been changed, reduced or added. This is an astonishing step forward for me. -- I will keep you posted on further eye exams in the time to come."" GH - CN</i></p>
<p>Ed.Note: GH's sharing, as from so many, <b><span>stirs us even more to get Dr.Thompson’s work out to more people. </span></b>As a “Bio-Tuning” it could help so many more than we are able to help at our Center with this very gentle, safe, and effective approach. <b>Contribute now </b>and help get this well-tested and fantastic product into the hands of those who <b>can help so many more people – perhaps even you, yourself.

<p>We're lucky to have someone with lifetime experience like Richard McGranahan on our team. Richard started off in the computer industry in 1969 where he left Kansas to go to New York where he automated the New York Stock Exchange. Whilst there, he provided technical support for a number of IBM mainframes. From there, his endeavors took him to Cleveland, Ohio where he automated their Police Department as well as the Water Department's booking systems. In 1970 he moved to Oskosh, Wisconsin to work at Kimberly-Clark, a paper company for whom he developed a management system for their forestries so that they could accurately measure the growth rate of trees and determine what their yields were going to be. After his time there, Richard ended up in Florida where he worked for TRW's electronics firms and automated their banking networks. In 1978, he became the Director of Communications for American Express working for them for two years. </p>
<p>It wasn't until 1979 that McGranahan found himself in sunny California, and decided to stay. His initial position was with a company called CubicWestern where he automated ski resorts' (across America) ticketing machines. Then he developed software for managing credit card processing and communications for the airline industry. He became a private consultant to the airline industry in 1980 where he helped a significant number or airlines (such as United, Delta, etc.) automate their back rooms and data centers. In 1983 he automated credit card processing for the hospitality across Mexico. He developed wireless boards until he retired in 1994, and now finds himself still eager to develop cutting edge technology for the right minded people. Ever since Richard discovered vibrational medicine, he has become a core member of this team.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Brainwave Entrainment and Hemisphere Synchronicity</b></p>
<p>This phenomenon of
hemisphere synchronicity is due to a quirk in how the brain processes
information and the physics phenomenon of the Critical bandwidth. When two
tones are tuned within 18% of one another (or within the critical bandwidth)
the brain cannot distinguish two separate tones, it hear one single tone with a
pulse within it. The speed of the pulse it hears is the difference between the
two tones. Through headphones, however, the opposite hemispheres, which process
sound information from each opposite ear, have to compare information in order
to hear the pulse. Actually the brain is manufacturing the pulse out of thin
air, moment by moment. When the hemispheres compare information, they synchronize
their activity: thus hemisphere synchronicity. </p>
<p>We know from other
research efforts that brainwave synchronicity does not happen often and when it
does, it is only for an instant. We know it is associated with the
""aha"" moment, the moment when the answer to a problem pops into
mind, in times of great inspiration, and certain high states of revelry and
meditation. With this new technological method of entraining brainwaves with
binaural beats using headphones, however, it is possible to float the brain in
this hemisphere synchronicity state for prolonged periods of time. Each time we
do this, it is like exercising a new brain function - which makes the brain
more able to engage this function as its normal repertoire of behavior. It is
like going to a gym on the inside and working the ""muscle"" of your
brain. </p>
<p>Using sound in
these ways, it is possible to make profound changes in brainwave patterns and
states of consciousness, observable on brainwave mapping equipment (EEG), as
well as positive changes in the body, measurable with blood tests, bio-feedback
equipment and other sophisticated procedures. We are also able to influence the
core balance and functioning of the brain and central nervous system as a
whole. </p>
<p>In a series of
recordings based on these principles I have used sound frequency patterns built
into the music that have been shown clinically to cause positive changes in
consciousness, brainwave and body function.</p>
<p>A good part of the
stress we all experience in the twentieth century is due to the advancements of
our own technology. This same technology, combined with our traditional
techniques for healing and achieving balance, may help neutralize the stress we
have created. </p>
<p><b>Primordial
Sounds</b><br/>
Many of the sounds you hear on these recordings are sounds you do not even
notice. Certain sounds have the power to awaken deep levels of recognition in
the subconscious mind. I call these sounds ""Primordial Sounds,"" sound
primordially recognizable to the subconscious mind regardless of race, sex or
language. </p>
<p>Our first sensory
experience in life as a fetus in the womb is of sound and vibration. The
symphony of sound patterns we experience at this time will be deeply imbedded
in our subconscious mind for the rest of our lives - water swishing sounds,
arterial pulse sounds and voice sounds. These are our first experiences of
""Primordial Sounds."" </p>
<p>Recordings of
these types of sounds form some of the ""primordial sounds"" you hear
on this recording. By changing the speed of these sounds we can side step the
rational/thinking mind, which will no longer recognize the sounds, and tap into
the subconscious directly, with sounds it deeply recognize and respond to. </p>
<p><b>Sounds
from Space </b><br/>
In 1989 we were approached by an aerospace engineer with sound recordings from
the Voyager spacecraft. These recordings were taken as Voyager passed by the
outer planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
<p>These were
recordings of charged electromagnetic particles (ions) in the magnetic fields
of these planets vibrating within the range of human hearing. What did they
sound like? They sound like dolphins, choirs of voices singing, crickets,
birds, Tibetan bowls, and ocean sounds, plus other sounds too strange to
identify, but which seem very familiar. </p>
<p>It is these three
classes of sound (""Primordial Sounds"", ""Brainwave Entrainment""
and ""multi-layered 3-D music"") that are embedded in all Dr. Thompson's soundtracks and recordings to awaken the various levels of the subconscious
mind. </p>
<p>This is what he
means by the use of ""Primordial Sounds"" to access a deep level of
ourselves for healing, relaxation and balance. These sounds are mixed into the
soundtrack in a way that they can be heard but not necessarily recognized for
what they are by the rational-thinking mind which frequently tends to block healing and personal growth potential. Some of the nature sounds you hear
are actually space sound recordings or human body sounds. </p>
<p><b>3-D
Psychoacoustic Processing and Acoustic Pacing</b><br/>
Brainwave entrainment is part of a larger biological function called
""Biological Sympathetic Oscillation"". Our biological
""clock"" sets itself to external cosmic events; day length cycles,
full moon cycles and seasonal cycles to name a few. The body will set itself to
the most powerful external pulse cycle it is exposed to. In this case we can
create powerful sound frequencies pulsing at exact brainwave speeds and cause
the brainwaves to alter themselves to match the sound frequencies - that is
entrain themselves to the sound pulses.</p>
<p>This has formed
the basis for another method Dr. Thompson developed for entraining the entire biological
network in the body, which he called ""Acoustic Pacing"". In Acoustic
Pacing he is taking nature sound recordings - recorded with special
Psychoacoustic 3-D microphones - and slowing these recordings down over time in
the soundtrack. Since all the audio memories stored in the brain from past
experiences are 3-D sound memories, a 3-D soundtrack fools the brain into
assuming these nature sounds are real. Since, as part of the larger world
phenomenon of ""Biological Sympathetic Oscillation"", mentioned before,
our bodies time themselves to larger nature cycles, when 3-D recordings of
nature sounds are slowed down over time, the body automatically adjusts its
internal timings accordingly and a global body-based entrainment of slowing
down occurs. Brainwaves slow in response to the whole system slowing in this
method. </p>
<p>When these
elements are combined together - relaxing music, nature sounds in 3-D slowing
down over time, brainwave entrainment pulses built into the harmonics of the
music and nature sounds - a more all inclusive and powerful relaxation response
takes place in the whole organism.</p>
<p>Certain types of
sounds and music have a proven effect in creating states of relaxation,
balance, healing and visualization. Generally these include certain types of
lyrical, flowing melodies and chord arrangements. Certain chord arrangements
can create an atmosphere of peace, mystery, awe and openness. </p>
<p><b>Physiologic
Response to Vibro-Tactile Induction Technology</b><br/>
The obvious stress reduction benefits of listening to relaxing music are known, as mentioned above. The type of music Dr Thompson creates for each audio program, therefore, is such that the purpose or goal of that program ""sweetens the pie"", as it were, to help one to more easily attain the brainwave state desired and receive the subsequent benefits of that state of consciousness. <br/></p>
<p>By delivering
these sound frequencies through the body directly, an entirely different system
of the body - spinal cord and areas of the brainstem and brain - are brought
into play, with the possibility of a much deeper whole-body response. With this
delivery system we have the possibility of direct cellular stimulation. Sound
frequency pulse waves played directly into the body also has a profound effect
on the nervous system. The entire posterior 1/3 of the spinal cord consists of
nerve tract bundles whose sole purpose is the transmission of vibration sense
data to the Brain Stem, Cerebellum, Pons, Medulla, Hippocampus/Limbic System (emotional
processing areas) and various areas of the Cerebral Cortex. </p>
<p>Far-reaching
possibilities are inherent in using this type of vibrational technology in the
areas of massage, energy work, physical healing, emotional release work,
hypnosis, stress reduction, relaxation and meditation.</p>

<p><b>THE CHAIR</b></p>
<p>First the prototype chair will be completed, which is coming along nicely.  Certain parts, such as the motor, are currently being made for us, and with out-sourcing other schedules need to be considered. The prototype chair could be ready in November, with manufacturing following closely thereafter -- but we need your help to manufacture.  We have orders waiting and want to fulfill no later than January 2014. Our challenge, again, is the cost of supplies; wood, upholstery, transducers, motors, etc; set-up for assembling and labor, etc. <br/></p>
<p><b>THE CONTROL BOX</b></p>
<p>Simultaneously, the electronics, software tweaks and hardware will be finished within the same time period, ready for further Beta testing in November. We have completed the Alpha testing already.  The challenge here, again, is the fund for duplicating, assembling and fine-tuning. Yes, we want you to be a part of all this.<br/></p>
<p><b>FINAL ADJUSTMENTS</b></p>
<p>Once the chair and control box prototypes are completely finished, the System will be fully tested and put through its paces, one user after another. Any tweaks will be corrected and finalized, tested and re-tested again. <br/></p>
<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b></p>
<p>After the final adjustments have been completed, manufacturing of the first 100 chairs allowing the filling of current orders, you, as one of our wonderful and generous backers (Whether you contributed $10 or $100,000 and left your contact info) will receive your ""Thank you"". This will occur at the conclusion of the campaign (or sooner if possible) and last until completed.  All will occur as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Please accept our current thanks now, however.  We appreciate your interest and ability to grasp the importance of this technology, the expertise and validity of Dr. Thompson""s work and that of our team noted above and the many others who help and will help to deliver this awesome product to interested Venues.

<p><b>Does one get Brainwave Synchronization when listening to your CDs?<b> </b></b></p>
<p>Yes, brainwave synchronization is achieved when wearing headphones.  If you read some of the <span><a href=""http://neuroacoustic.com/testimonials.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Testimonials</a> </span>shared with us, you will see many examples of brainwave synchronization.  Many contributors speak clearly of their moment of insight and awareness, of their moment of realization, their moment which brought about a significant change in their life, or the deep feeling of relaxation, peace, contentment, joy, love, etc.<br/></p>
<p><b><b>If I do not use headphones, can I still benefit from your CDs?</b></b></p>
<p>Yes, definitely!  Great benefit comes when listening to any audio programs created by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson.  As background music, they form a relaxing and pleasant environment.  Greater benefit occurs, however, when you listen to the composition with good quality headphones.  Even more benefit occurs if you listen to his CDs with headphones and the Audio Visual Modulator. Maximum benefit is achieved when listening to his audio programs using headphones, the light glasses, and one of his body support sound delivery structures, such as the <a href=""http://neuroacoustic.com/soundchair.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sound Chair</a>.  When combining all three, you are then using your three (3) Primary Modes of Learning  &lt;&lt;Visual - Auditory - Kinesthetic&gt;&gt;  What you hear is what you feel, what you feel is what you see, and what you see is what you hear.  You become the Sound/Light/Sensation, as it were.  It’s a unique way to fully integrate your brain in a multi-dimensional way -- an awesome experience – truly wonderful and healing.</p>
<p><b><b>When I go to bed and listen to Dr. Thompson’s music, must I wear headphones?</b></b></p>
<p>No, this is not necessary.  Hemispheric synchronization is not necessary for sleep.  It is helpful to place your stereo speakers on either side of your bed, however, to benefit from the 3-D stereo work of Dr. Thompson.  If this is not possible, then placing your player at the foot of your bed toward the middle of where you sleep is recommended. <br/></p>
<p><b><b>Do you have subliminal messages on your CDs?</b></b></p>
<p>No, there are no subliminal messages on any audio programs composed and produced by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson.  His audio programs are gentle but powerful enough to accomplish their goal without subliminal programming!<br/></p>
<p><b><b>What is the difference between the Limited Edition Chair and the Home Edition Chair?</b></b></p>
<p>Nothing other than style and rarity! The Limited Edition Chair will have white leather and a unique chrome base signed by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson and the designer of the chair, Scott Gressitt. So catch them while you can, they are definitely a collectors choice!</p>
<p><b><b>What exercises should I do to achieve the brainwave state noted on your CDs?</b></b></p>
<p>No physical or mental exercises are needed to achieve the brainwave state noted for any of Dr. Jeffrey Thompson’s audio programs.  The music itself will enhance your ability to attain the brainwave state of that audio program.  Open receptivity is an important key.  Simply make yourself comfortable, place your headphones and a light blanket on yourself, start your CD player and simply follow the music.  Let it take you where it will.  If working with a specific concern, you may begin the session with this foremost in your mind, then relax and let it go into your subconscious mind as a silent question or request.  Follow the music, unattached to your concern, and see/watch what happens.  You may well be surprised at what comes to you during or after the session, in a dream at night or as an insight during the day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Do you cover shipping costs?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we will cover shipping costs within the United States, but ask you to cover shipping or postage costs outside the USA.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I live outside of the United States, can your Sound Chair operate on our power supply?</span></p>
<p>Yes, we ship globally.  Transformers / electrical converter have been necessary in the past, but we believe we will resolve that challenge with a dual electrical option.  If you have a concern, do not hesitate to e-mail us - cnr@neuroacoustic.com.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">How are your light glasses different from others on the market?</span></p>
<p>The Dr Jeff Audio/Visual Modulator w/ Light Glasses are driven directly by the sound and music you are playing.  Other light glasses are driven by specific programs which ""ramp"" the flashing of the lights slower or faster to entrain the brainwaves.  When you use the A/V Modulator you see what you are hearing.  Since what you are hearing is a compilation of Dr. Thompson's proprietary brainwave technology, his special light glasses translate this to your eyes and cause hemisphere synchronicity in the visual lobes of your brain in sync with the synchronicity of the hearing centers through the headphones. What you see is your own “light show” as determined by the rods and cones on your optic nerve and how your brain interprets the experience.  They are fun, enhance brainwave entrainment, and for many youngsters especially who have visual challenges, there is help.  Every ""light show"" is different even with the same music as we continually change and are at a different place, as it were, each time we use the glasses. You see what you hear…</p>
<b>Can any CDs be played through your Light Glasses?</b><p></p>
<p>Yes, any CD may be played through the Dr. Jeff Audio/Visual Modulator.  Dr. Jeffrey Thompson's audio programs have the most correct technology for using with the Light Glasses, however, any CD may be used.  Since the proprietary sound pulses in the soundtrack are also driving the lights in the glasses, you get a visual entrainment in sync with the auditory entrainment. This is the reason Dr. Thompson had to develop his own glasses. No other glasses on the market provided this pulse-driven ability.  He wanted to offer persons the tools to balance the visual and auditory centers of their brain simultaneously, and thus reap the benefit of that synchronization.  He accomplished that goal by creating the <a href=""http://neuroacoustic.com/lightglasses.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Audio/Visual Modulator with light glasses</span></a> and making it available to interested parties.  (Editor’s note:  Although we know of no definitive problem, light glasses are generally counter-indicated for persons who have a seizure problem or who suffer from migraine headaches.)<br/></p>

Homeo: within myself, STASIS: zero stress and balance. Homeostasis is a foundation state of the body that must be present before the body can really heal. At the Center for Neuroacoustic Research we work directly with the most prominent 21st century dis-ease, a dis-ease which is silently robbing the majority of society of good health and wellness and is the baseline cause of most diseases in the developed world. It is -- 
                                            The Loss of Homeostasis! 
What's causing this loss of Homeostasis? STRESS! Our bodies were designed for a sprint not a marathon. Our present body was designed hundreds of thousands of years ago for a very different environment of stress then we now experience. What used to be waking with the sun, grabbing a spear and going out to chase breakfast (and that's your workday) has become a never-ending series of stress assaults on our body/mind....alarm clock / rushed breakfast / processed food / traffic jams / fumes / pollution / stressful job / never enough money / home after a long day / rushed microwaved dinner / evening news on TV (!!!) / kids,homework,etc / ever wonder why you can't sleep... and tomorrow is ""Rinse and Repeat""! 
The Neuro-Synergy System specializes in reducing stress to ZERO and re-training the stress handling centers of the body to return to normal function: HOMEOSTASIS.
The main control centers in the body use the state of Homeostasis to tell all the systems in the body what to do. This loss of the ability of the body to return to its core zero-stress state of Homeostasis, causes the main control centers in the nervous system to begin to lose control of the body. Our clinical research over the past 30 years has resulted in patented techniques for measuring Homeostasis in the nervous system and returning the system to a state of homeostasis-synergy using precisely tuned sound frequencies through the body as low frequency vibrations. The whole approach used in the Neuro-Synergy System is very complex, but the core approach is returning the master control systems of the body to the Homeostasis State of Neuro-Synergy. 
From Wikipedia:
Synergy is the interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce an effect different from or greater than the sum of their individual effects. The term synergy comes from the Greek word synergiaσυνέργια from synergos, συνεργός, meaning ""working together"".
WHAT IS BEHIND THE NEURO-SYNERGY SYSTEM?
Neuro-Synergy Systems (NSS) is dedicated
to placing a clinically tested, high-tech holistic healing system into the main-stream healthcare market.The strength of NSS’s work lies in its foundation of over
two decades of scientific clinical research with thousands of patients and
volunteers using recognized medical monitoring systems that can show the benefits of this therapeutic approach in the brain, brainwaves and deep nervous system control centers of the body for a wide range of health conditions without the use of drugs or surgery. This testing and research has shown us which types of sounds, music, brainwave entrainment frequencies and primordial sounds work best generically for a new breed of ""Prescription Only"" healing soundtracks beneficial for the largest audience possible.
THE NEURO-SYNERGY SYSTEM IS PLACED - NOT SOLD
Yes, our business model for the Neuro-Synergy System is a new paradigm for many.  It is  unique, whereby we are Not selling the Systems, thereby assisting Venue owners to enhance their practice or business by asking for no capital outlay to pay for the System. We Place and then Maintain the Systems in doctor's offices, hospitals, spas; nursing and residential facilities; gyms, fitness centers and athletic facilities; human resource and nursing departments for employees and in corporate offices at No Cost. We charge a small fee, not a percent, whenever an individual uses the System, however. 
We also electronically monitor the functionality of the System through the internet. If something appears to be a slowing down or not performing correctly we can fix it remotely if it is a software problem. If it is a hardware problem, our placement personnel come and switch out the faulty part or replace the whole system if necessary, at no cost to the Venue. 
We want to empower as many practitioners and businesses as possible to enhance and complement their service to those who need to re-gain or ""find"" their Neuro-Synergy so they can better heal and enjoy good health.  We want to reward the Venues by boosting their income by upwards to $3,000 a month with no additional cost to them, simply by using the System. And we want all to help spread this new holistic healing modality throughout the world. Society needs help.  We need your help. Can you / will you ""Pay the good received thus far in your life Forward""? We hope so!  Everyone can and will profit!
WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL HERE?
The goal of CNR is to bring to the
scientific community and to the public-at-large, a well-researched, safe,
non-invasive, intrinsically gentle but powerful modality for managing personal
health and well-being, and for personal growth and transformation, safe for all ages. This is accomplished
through Dr. Thompson’s clinically tested sound compositions  and it is with his scientifically engineered Neuro-Synergy
Sound Chairs and Tables aka System that we move toward our vision -- a vision of
individuals, and eventually the world, healthy and living its highest purpose –
living, working and playing from its center. 
Our Motto: 
“Healing Body * Heart * Mind and
Spirit through the Scientific Application of Sound” .

           DR. JEFFREY THOMPSON
    Founder of Neuro-Synergy Systems

Dr. Thompson has been experimenting with sound scientifically since 1980. He first started in his Holistic Health Center in Virginia which grew to be the largest Center of its kind in Virginia at the time. His experiments were in using exact sound frequencies to make Chiropractic spinal and cranial adjustments, to stimulate and normalize organ function and to balance Acupuncture Meridians. He developed a very gentle and effective method of making adjustments and continues to use this approach today. His gentle and effective method is much appreciated by his patients. 

In addition to his chiropractic expertise, Dr. Thompson is recognized as a worldwide expert in the field of acoustic pacing frequencies incorporated into musical sound tracks. A consummate musician and composer in his own rite, he has established a method for using modulated sound-pulses for changing states of consciousness for optimal ""Mind-Body"" healing. 
Dr. Thompson's first recording, Isle of Skye, was carried by major music distributors in the US within its first month of release. Within the first six months, it was adopted by the American Hypnotherapy Association for its use in hypnosis. In the years since, Dr Thompson has generated more than ninety acoustic pacing compact disks and audiotapes sold globally and used by Holistic physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, chiropractors, massage therapists and other bodywork professionals as well as the general public.
His CDs are carried nationally in major stores and catalogs: Barnes & Noble, Borders, Sam Goody's, Waldenbooks, Nightingale-Conant, Nautilus, and many others. His well-received and effective Delta Sleep System CD Set was carried through national TV ads by Time/Life for two years. His work with Brookstone, Inc. and other companies are carried in their respective stores and websites.

The accomplishments and creativity of Dr. Thompson is nothing short of being “mind-boggling”. He continues to be very prolific in his efforts and dedication to the healing of the Global Body of the Universe through the healing of individuals of which it is comprised.

             RICHARD MCGRANAHAN

        Electronics | Software Design

We're lucky to have someone with lifetime experience like Richard McGranahan on our team. Richard started off in the computer industry in 1969 where he left Kansas to go to New York where he automated the New York Stock Exchange. Whilst there, he provided technical support for a number of IBM mainframes. From there, his endeavors took him to Cleveland, Ohio where he automated their Police Department as well as the Water Department's booking systems. In 1970 he moved to Oskosh, Wisconsin to work at Kimberly-Clark, a paper company for whom he developed a management system for their forestries so that they could accurately measure the growth rate of trees and determine what their yields were going to be. After his time there, Richard ended up in Florida where he worked for TRW's electronics firms and automated their banking networks. In 1978, he became the Director of Communications for American Express working for them for two years. 
It wasn't until 1979 that McGranahan found himself in sunny California, and decided to stay. His initial position was with a company called CubicWestern where he automated ski resorts' (across America) ticketing machines. Then he developed software for managing credit card processing and communications for the airline industry. He became a private consultant to the airline industry in 1980 where he helped a significant number or airlines (such as United, Delta, etc.) automate their back rooms and data centers. In 1983 he automated credit card processing for the hospitality across Mexico. He developed wireless boards until he retired in 1994, and now finds himself still eager to develop cutting edge technology for the right minded people. Ever since Richard discovered vibrational medicine, he has become a core member of this team.

Brainwave Entrainment and Hemisphere Synchronicity
This phenomenon of
hemisphere synchronicity is due to a quirk in how the brain processes
information and the physics phenomenon of the Critical bandwidth. When two
tones are tuned within 18% of one another (or within the critical bandwidth)
the brain cannot distinguish two separate tones, it hear one single tone with a
pulse within it. The speed of the pulse it hears is the difference between the
two tones. Through headphones, however, the opposite hemispheres, which process
sound information from each opposite ear, have to compare information in order
to hear the pulse. Actually the brain is manufacturing the pulse out of thin
air, moment by moment. When the hemispheres compare information, they synchronize
their activity: thus hemisphere synchronicity. 
We know from other
research efforts that brainwave synchronicity does not happen often and when it
does, it is only for an instant. We know it is associated with the
""aha"" moment, the moment when the answer to a problem pops into
mind, in times of great inspiration, and certain high states of revelry and
meditation. With this new technological method of entraining brainwaves with
binaural beats using headphones, however, it is possible to float the brain in
this hemisphere synchronicity state for prolonged periods of time. Each time we
do this, it is like exercising a new brain function - which makes the brain
more able to engage this function as its normal repertoire of behavior. It is
like going to a gym on the inside and working the ""muscle"" of your
brain. 
Using sound in
these ways, it is possible to make profound changes in brainwave patterns and
states of consciousness, observable on brainwave mapping equipment (EEG), as
well as positive changes in the body, measurable with blood tests, bio-feedback
equipment and other sophisticated procedures. We are also able to influence the
core balance and functioning of the brain and central nervous system as a
whole. 
In a series of
recordings based on these principles I have used sound frequency patterns built
into the music that have been shown clinically to cause positive changes in
consciousness, brainwave and body function.
A good part of the
stress we all experience in the twentieth century is due to the advancements of
our own technology. This same technology, combined with our traditional
techniques for healing and achieving balance, may help neutralize the stress we
have created. 
Primordial
Sounds
Many of the sounds you hear on these recordings are sounds you do not even
notice. Certain sounds have the power to awaken deep levels of recognition in
the subconscious mind. I call these sounds ""Primordial Sounds,"" sound
primordially recognizable to the subconscious mind regardless of race, sex or
language. 
Our first sensory
experience in life as a fetus in the womb is of sound and vibration. The
symphony of sound patterns we experience at this time will be deeply imbedded
in our subconscious mind for the rest of our lives - water swishing sounds,
arterial pulse sounds and voice sounds. These are our first experiences of
""Primordial Sounds."" 
Recordings of
these types of sounds form some of the ""primordial sounds"" you hear
on this recording. By changing the speed of these sounds we can side step the
rational/thinking mind, which will no longer recognize the sounds, and tap into
the subconscious directly, with sounds it deeply recognize and respond to. 
Sounds
from Space 
In 1989 we were approached by an aerospace engineer with sound recordings from
the Voyager spacecraft. These recordings were taken as Voyager passed by the
outer planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
These were
recordings of charged electromagnetic particles (ions) in the magnetic fields
of these planets vibrating within the range of human hearing. What did they
sound like? They sound like dolphins, choirs of voices singing, crickets,
birds, Tibetan bowls, and ocean sounds, plus other sounds too strange to
identify, but which seem very familiar. 
It is these three
classes of sound (""Primordial Sounds"", ""Brainwave Entrainment""
and ""multi-layered 3-D music"") that are embedded in all Dr. Thompson's soundtracks and recordings to awaken the various levels of the subconscious
mind. 
This is what he
means by the use of ""Primordial Sounds"" to access a deep level of
ourselves for healing, relaxation and balance. These sounds are mixed into the
soundtrack in a way that they can be heard but not necessarily recognized for
what they are by the rational-thinking mind which frequently tends to block healing and personal growth potential. Some of the nature sounds you hear
are actually space sound recordings or human body sounds. 
3-D
Psychoacoustic Processing and Acoustic Pacing
Brainwave entrainment is part of a larger biological function called
""Biological Sympathetic Oscillation"". Our biological
""clock"" sets itself to external cosmic events; day length cycles,
full moon cycles and seasonal cycles to name a few. The body will set itself to
the most powerful external pulse cycle it is exposed to. In this case we can
create powerful sound frequencies pulsing at exact brainwave speeds and cause
the brainwaves to alter themselves to match the sound frequencies - that is
entrain themselves to the sound pulses.
This has formed
the basis for another method Dr. Thompson developed for entraining the entire biological
network in the body, which he called ""Acoustic Pacing"". In Acoustic
Pacing he is taking nature sound recordings - recorded with special
Psychoacoustic 3-D microphones - and slowing these recordings down over time in
the soundtrack. Since all the audio memories stored in the brain from past
experiences are 3-D sound memories, a 3-D soundtrack fools the brain into
assuming these nature sounds are real. Since, as part of the larger world
phenomenon of ""Biological Sympathetic Oscillation"", mentioned before,
our bodies time themselves to larger nature cycles, when 3-D recordings of
nature sounds are slowed down over time, the body automatically adjusts its
internal timings accordingly and a global body-based entrainment of slowing
down occurs. Brainwaves slow in response to the whole system slowing in this
method. 
When these
elements are combined together - relaxing music, nature sounds in 3-D slowing
down over time, brainwave entrainment pulses built into the harmonics of the
music and nature sounds - a more all inclusive and powerful relaxation response
takes place in the whole organism.
Certain types of
sounds and music have a proven effect in creating states of relaxation,
balance, healing and visualization. Generally these include certain types of
lyrical, flowing melodies and chord arrangements. Certain chord arrangements
can create an atmosphere of peace, mystery, awe and openness. 
Physiologic
Response to Vibro-Tactile Induction Technology
The obvious stress reduction benefits of listening to relaxing music are known, as mentioned above. The type of music Dr Thompson creates for each audio program, therefore, is such that the purpose or goal of that program ""sweetens the pie"", as it were, to help one to more easily attain the brainwave state desired and receive the subsequent benefits of that state of consciousness. 
By delivering
these sound frequencies through the body directly, an entirely different system
of the body - spinal cord and areas of the brainstem and brain - are brought
into play, with the possibility of a much deeper whole-body response. With this
delivery system we have the possibility of direct cellular stimulation. Sound
frequency pulse waves played directly into the body also has a profound effect
on the nervous system. The entire posterior 1/3 of the spinal cord consists of
nerve tract bundles whose sole purpose is the transmission of vibration sense
data to the Brain Stem, Cerebellum, Pons, Medulla, Hippocampus/Limbic System (emotional
processing areas) and various areas of the Cerebral Cortex. 
Far-reaching
possibilities are inherent in using this type of vibrational technology in the
areas of massage, energy work, physical healing, emotional release work,
hypnosis, stress reduction, relaxation and meditation.

The curve of the chair is based on a NASA technology transfer (your tax dollars at work and public domain) in which they took astronauts floating weightless in space and measured their body position curvatures to create the perfect ergonomic chair curve...combined with a reclining angle in which the head and knees are on the same horizontal plane, the zero stress-point for the cardiovascular system is achieved. This is the technology we have used in the seat design of the Neuro-Synergy System Recliner.


Note: The segment angles shown are means. Values in parentheses are standard deviations from the mean. The data was developed in Skylab studies and is based on the measurement of 12 subjects. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




THE CHAIR
First the prototype chair will be completed, which is coming along nicely.  Certain parts, such as the motor, are currently being made for us, and with out-sourcing other schedules need to be considered. The prototype chair could be ready in November, with manufacturing following closely thereafter -- but we need your help to manufacture.  We have orders waiting and want to fulfill no later than January 2014. Our challenge, again, is the cost of supplies; wood, upholstery, transducers, motors, etc; set-up for assembling and labor, etc. 
THE CONTROL BOX
Simultaneously, the electronics, software tweaks and hardware will be finished within the same time period, ready for further Beta testing in November. We have completed the Alpha testing already.  The challenge here, again, is the fund for duplicating, assembling and fine-tuning. Yes, we want you to be a part of all this.
FINAL ADJUSTMENTS
Once the chair and control box prototypes are completely finished, the System will be fully tested and put through its paces, one user after another. Any tweaks will be corrected and finalized, tested and re-tested again. 
DISTRIBUTION
After the final adjustments have been completed, manufacturing of the first 100 chairs allowing the filling of current orders, you, as one of our wonderful and generous backers (Whether you contributed $10 or $100,000 and left your contact info) will receive your ""Thank you"". This will occur at the conclusion of the campaign (or sooner if possible) and last until completed.  All will occur as quickly as possible.
Please accept our current thanks now, however.  We appreciate your interest and ability to grasp the importance of this technology, the expertise and validity of Dr. Thompson""s work and that of our team noted above and the many others who help and will help to deliver this awesome product to interested Venues. THANK YOU!

                         Some of the CD Choices and Headphones

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Does one get Brainwave Synchronization when listening to your CDs? 
Yes, brainwave synchronization is achieved when wearing headphones.  If you read some of the Testimonials shared with us, you will see many examples of brainwave synchronization.  Many contributors speak clearly of their moment of insight and awareness, of their moment of realization, their moment which brought about a significant change in their life, or the deep feeling of relaxation, peace, contentment, joy, love, etc.
If I do not use headphones, can I still benefit from your CDs?
Yes, definitely!  Great benefit comes when listening to any audio programs created by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson.  As background music, they form a relaxing and pleasant environment.  Greater benefit occurs, however, when you listen to the composition with good quality headphones.  Even more benefit occurs if you listen to his CDs with headphones and the Audio Visual Modulator. Maximum benefit is achieved when listening to his audio programs using headphones, the light glasses, and one of his body support sound delivery structures, such as the Sound Chair.  When combining all three, you are then using your three (3) Primary Modes of Learning  <<Visual - Auditory - Kinesthetic>>  What you hear is what you feel, what you feel is what you see, and what you see is what you hear.  You become the Sound/Light/Sensation, as it were.  It’s a unique way to fully integrate your brain in a multi-dimensional way -- an awesome experience – truly wonderful and healing.
When I go to bed and listen to Dr. Thompson’s music, must I wear headphones?
No, this is not necessary.  Hemispheric synchronization is not necessary for sleep.  It is helpful to place your stereo speakers on either side of your bed, however, to benefit from the 3-D stereo work of Dr. Thompson.  If this is not possible, then placing your player at the foot of your bed toward the middle of where you sleep is recommended. 
Do you have subliminal messages on your CDs?
No, there are no subliminal messages on any audio programs composed and produced by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson.  His audio programs are gentle but powerful enough to accomplish their goal without subliminal programming!
What is the difference between the Limited Edition Chair and the Home Edition Chair?
Nothing other than style and rarity! The Limited Edition Chair will have white leather and a unique chrome base signed by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson and the designer of the chair, Scott Gressitt. So catch them while you can, they are definitely a collectors choice!
What exercises should I do to achieve the brainwave state noted on your CDs?
No physical or mental exercises are needed to achieve the brainwave state noted for any of Dr. Jeffrey Thompson’s audio programs.  The music itself will enhance your ability to attain the brainwave state of that audio program.  Open receptivity is an important key.  Simply make yourself comfortable, place your headphones and a light blanket on yourself, start your CD player and simply follow the music.  Let it take you where it will.  If working with a specific concern, you may begin the session with this foremost in your mind, then relax and let it go into your subconscious mind as a silent question or request.  Follow the music, unattached to your concern, and see/watch what happens.  You may well be surprised at what comes to you during or after the session, in a dream at night or as an insight during the day.

Do you cover shipping costs?
Yes, we will cover shipping costs within the United States, but ask you to cover shipping or postage costs outside the USA.
I live outside of the United States, can your Sound Chair operate on our power supply?
Yes, we ship globally.  Transformers / electrical converter have been necessary in the past, but we believe we will resolve that challenge with a dual electrical option.  If you have a concern, do not hesitate to e-mail us - cnr@neuroacoustic.com.
How are your light glasses different from others on the market?
The Dr Jeff Audio/Visual Modulator w/ Light Glasses are driven directly by the sound and music you are playing.  Other light glasses are driven by specific programs which ""ramp"" the flashing of the lights slower or faster to entrain the brainwaves.  When you use the A/V Modulator you see what you are hearing.  Since what you are hearing is a compilation of Dr. Thompson's proprietary brainwave technology, his special light glasses translate this to your eyes and cause hemisphere synchronicity in the visual lobes of your brain in sync with the synchronicity of the hearing centers through the headphones. What you see is your own “light show” as determined by the rods and cones on your optic nerve and how your brain interprets the experience.  They are fun, enhance brainwave entrainment, and for many youngsters especially who have visual challenges, there is help.  Every ""light show"" is different even with the same music as we continually change and are at a different place, as it were, each time we use the glasses. You see what you hear…
Can any CDs be played through your Light Glasses?
Yes, any CD may be played through the Dr. Jeff Audio/Visual Modulator.  Dr. Jeffrey Thompson's audio programs have the most correct technology for using with the Light Glasses, however, any CD may be used.  Since the proprietary sound pulses in the soundtrack are also driving the lights in the glasses, you get a visual entrainment in sync with the auditory entrainment. This is the reason Dr. Thompson had to develop his own glasses. No other glasses on the market provided this pulse-driven ability.  He wanted to offer persons the tools to balance the visual and auditory centers of their brain simultaneously, and thus reap the benefit of that synchronization.  He accomplished that goal by creating the Audio/Visual Modulator with light glasses and making it available to interested parties.  (Editor’s note:  Although we know of no definitive problem, light glasses are generally counter-indicated for persons who have a seizure problem or who suffer from migraine headaches.)",18.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><span><b>The Problem We Aim to Solve</b></span></p>
<br/><p>While the idea is to propagate exceptional healthcare to all corners of the globe, Founder Nauman Jaffar and Dr. Asim Cheema conceived this timely solution in 2014, after a personal tragedy struck Nauman close to his heart. </p>
<br/><p>His beloved aunt who was like a mother to him was misdiagnosed with stomach flu while in fact she had stage three ovarian cancer. The true cause of her illness was tragically detected late, nearly three months after the initial false diagnosis. Failing to receive a timely ""accurate"" diagnosis, she passed away within six months. </p>
<br/><p>This was the moment Nauman decided to step down from his high profile corporate life and fully commit to developing a solution. A solution preventing anyone in the world from suffering a loss from medical misdiagnosis by connecting world-class specialists to patient doorsteps, or simply a click away.</p>

We are a small dynamic team of highly motivated partners, professionals and volunteers working around the world in: 

Toronto, Canada (Head Office)
Maryland, United States
Los Angeles, California
Bangalore, India & Lahore
Islamabad, Pakistan

In addition, our Board of Advisers join us from five major continents including Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and North America. 
Our team members include business, technology and healthcare specialists. We combined our expertise to develop a unique digital healthcare platform providing online medical opinions from world-class, board certified and pre-vetted doctors and specialists practicing exclusively in North America to patients around the world.




The Problem We Aim to Solve
While the idea is to propagate exceptional healthcare to all corners of the globe, Founder Nauman Jaffar and Dr. Asim Cheema conceived this timely solution in 2014, after a personal tragedy struck Nauman close to his heart. 
His beloved aunt who was like a mother to him was misdiagnosed with stomach flu while in fact she had stage three ovarian cancer. The true cause of her illness was tragically detected late, nearly three months after the initial false diagnosis. Failing to receive a timely ""accurate"" diagnosis, she passed away within six months. 
This was the moment Nauman decided to step down from his high profile corporate life and fully commit to developing a solution. A solution preventing anyone in the world from suffering a loss from medical misdiagnosis by connecting world-class specialists to patient doorsteps, or simply a click away.



Defining Medical Misdiagnosis Solutions
Today, after nearly one and a half years of diligent effort and bootstrapping, we have developed a platform summarized below in terms of our simple value proposition. Our personal efforts have laid a foundation worth building greatness upon, a cost we have personally funded through loans and even second home mortgages. This is how strongly we feel about our mission, and how deeply we care.





YourDoctors.Online offers a myriad of benefits to our clients and patients. Our medical opinion solutions boast proven credibility, HIPPA and PHIPPA compliance and premier affiliations with North American hospitals, among other benefits. Get a more detailed view into our unique patient platform below. 





Our team of partnered doctors and specialists cover a wide range of medical services and fields. YourDoctors.Online doctors and world-class medical specialists benefit through a dynamic global patient outreach. They also have the opportunity to increase their revenue while helming their own virtual practice. Take a look at the practitioner features we offer below. 



Presently, the platform is fully developed at https://yourdoctors.online. However, our mission is not yet complete. We need your help to commercialize and make this platform accessible to a wider audience, extending expert medical opinions to as many people and patients around the world. With approximately 100 plus doctors covering more than 30 different specialties, we are ready to serve the world through this social enterprise. Many of our expert physicians have also offered their services as charity, because we strive to save lives with medical opinions that matter. Think of us as ""Doctors Without Borders,"" or a ""global virtual hospital"" eager to help those in desperate need. By arming patients with a second medical diagnosis and treatment plan our mission to intervene in possibly life threatening situations can become a powerful reality and movement.


What We Need to Make an Impact and What You Get as a Result
First and foremost, we need funding. In order to continue our mission, we need a minimum of $25,000 to be utilized in marketing our platform to different parts of the world. Our team has tested the market carefully for three months solely using our own funds, concluding that every $25 spent secures one patient registration. 
Your $25,000 funding will allow us to reach our initial goal of 1,000 deserving patients in need. Additionally, your funding will assist in our goal of attracting nearly 35,000 unique users to our website. Our pilot program had promising success, where a $10,000 investment reached 13,000 unique users. 
The funding will be allocated primarily to our Google (1st with 60%) and Facebook (2nd with 20%) campaigns. Our future LinkedIn campaign has projected potential as well, with an allocation of 10%. A more detailed scheduling of funds is provided below.  
The following data and projections are an estimate of our expenses organized in priority and sequence of use:

Google Ads: $10,000 for 2 months with an average of $0.6 cents per click
Facebook & LinkedIn: $5,000 with an average of $1 per click
Reader's Digest advertisement campaign of up to $5,000 ( http://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/2016_RD_Mediakit_FINAL_12.15.pdf )
Feature on Silicon review as best managed startup: $2,000
Campaign utilizing top 3 key influencers: $3,000, eg., Hassan Nisar for $2,000 An unbiased political figure in South Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America with 1.7 million followers and 300,000 daily visits.

Are You Ready to Save Lives and Make a Global Impact?

This campaign’s target is to reach people who want to join us on a journey to help save lives with a focus on timely and accurate medical diagnoses from world-class specialists. 
It’s for people who are passionate about helping others, making quality healthcare accessible to everyone, regardless of location and situation. We offer services for free or at a discounted rate, and by dropping our name and utilizing coupon codes, you can utilize the following perks:


A backing of $10 will get your name and photo featured on our social media accounts reaching over 3,000 followers. You will appear on our Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter pages with a unique YourDoctors.Online banner reading, “I contributed towards helping save someone's life.” You will be sent a link to the posts via your social media accounts as well. 
A backing of $25 will get you a free general medical opinion valued at $49. You can use or share the discount code with someone else as well.
A backing of $150 gets you four general medical opinions for FREE valued at $200.
A backing of $400 gives you 100% off a specialist’s medical opinion valued at $500.
A backing of $600 earns you two free specialist medical opinions valued at $1000.

The Impact of Your Funding is Profound
To understand the potential size of the problem, review a few simple statistics on how often medical misdiagnoses occur below. The reputable nature of this startling data is compiled from JAMA, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard Medical School and other peer reviewed academic studies conducted in the United States. IBM Healthcare, and other reputable research institutions compliment these studies conducted over past decades as well.

 



An Invaluable Mission Making a Global Healthcare Impact

Just like water, clean air, food, security, home and several other basic life necessities, we believe quality health care should be accessible to each and every individual in the world, regardless of geographical boundaries.
Misdiagnosis is a serious global problem currently under represented and needs to be addressed.
While misdiagnosis is the 3rd leading cause of death in the U.S., there is a 1 in 3 chance the treatment you receive might not be proper. Our solution provides an excellent option to seek a confidential, comprehensive and credible medical opinion that helps in the following key ways







Risks & Challenges
People value transparency. Being open and standing out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles faced on the way to achieving a goal is paramount.
It is possible that with 50% off on perks with lesser funding, we might not get any funds for actually marketing the service. In this case, we are happy to know people who care are using our platform. As mitigation we have extended our funding to personal loans, and actually using our homes and other assets as collateral to widen our mission’s reach globally.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. Don't forget to help us spread the word by sharing our campaign or our website YourDoctors.Online on your social media. Share with people the problem we are attempting to solve. 
A simple message like the below examples can make an impact as well:
1. Help spread the word and possibly save someone's life with proper diagnosis - visit YourDoctors.Online. 
2. Life gives you a second chance – it’s called tomorrow. Now you can give someone else a health minded second chance by accessing YourDoctors.Online where up to 68% of patients have discovered a second opinion that has changed their diagnosis, treatment or surgery options.

<b><br/>A TALE OF TWO KNEES (and other things).</b><br/><br/>It started many years ago - my knees started to give out.  I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis and myofascitis.  The cartilage in my knees was eroding.  I went to my first Dragon*Con in Atlanta in 2006, dressed up, met amazing people, made wonderful friends, and felt I had come home.  I had found like-minded people who understood where I was coming from.  I had to do it again.<br/><br/>The knees got worse.  Yet every year I went to the Con, using a cane, walking with ever-increasing pain to the point where the painkillers clouded most of my weekend.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/703708/files/20140708172743-heavy.jpg?1404865663"" src="""" style=""width: 282.667px; height: 212px;""/> (me &amp; lovely friend Pierre Bernard)<br/></p>Then, two years ago, I was diagnosed with diabetes.  That required some drastic changes, including the loss of 70 pounds.  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/703717/files/20140708173406-loss2.jpg?1404866046"" src="""" style=""width: 207.76px; height: 470px;""/> (2013)<br/></p>
<p> But my knees were shot.  It was now bone grinding on bone and every step was excruciating.  Sleep was hell, when I got it.<br/></p>But wait!  There's more!  I broke my tailbone.  That just sucked.  But that wasn't the cherry on top.<br/><br/>I had to put my oldest cat, Martin, down on the Summer Solstice 2013.  I still miss my little sun kitty.  Still not the cherry on top!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/703721/files/20140708173604-marty.JPG?1404866164"" src="""" style=""width: 226.5px; height: 302px;""/> (Marty, 2013)<br/></p>
<br/>Finally, at the end of 2013, I got permission from my boss to take time out of work and get both my knees replaced.  JOY!  I spent three months doing the surgeries - the left knee, followed six weeks later by my right knee.  Then my boss let me go two weeks before Christmas - that's the cherry on top.  So I went through three more months of rehab, gaining back my strength, rediscovering, for the first time in almost a decade, what it felt like to move without pain.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/703728/files/20140708173648-bothsurg.JPG?1404866208"" src="""" style=""width: 290.667px; height: 218px;""/> (after right knee surgery)<br/></p>

(me & lovely friend Pierre Bernard)Then, two years ago, I was diagnosed with diabetes.  That required some drastic changes, including the loss of 70 pounds.   (2013)
 But my knees were shot.  It was now bone grinding on bone and every step was excruciating.  Sleep was hell, when I got it.But wait!  There's more!  I broke my tailbone.  That just sucked.  But that wasn't the cherry on top.I had to put my oldest cat, Martin, down on the Summer Solstice 2013.  I still miss my little sun kitty.  Still not the cherry on top! (Marty, 2013)
Finally, at the end of 2013, I got permission from my boss to take time out of work and get both my knees replaced.  JOY!  I spent three months doing the surgeries - the left knee, followed six weeks later by my right knee.  Then my boss let me go two weeks before Christmas - that's the cherry on top.  So I went through three more months of rehab, gaining back my strength, rediscovering, for the first time in almost a decade, what it felt like to move without pain. (after right knee surgery)
 (both knees, slowly recovering)
In April, Niles, my little tuxedo kitty, had to be put down.  Three months later, and I miss his sweetness every day. (Sir Niles of Happypants)It's been rough.  Really rough.  I feel scraped down to my very soul.  Almost like I've been wearing the Ring too long.Now, I'm able to walk, to live, to experience this once-yearly treat as I've never experienced it before, this cavalcade of awesome people and time away from my troubles, and I'm finding it difficult to come up with the funding.  As a temp (finding a permanent job these days is just hell), I'm making below my normal salary, barely able to pay the bills and keep my cats in food and litter. (Damn, but I am BEAT.)
THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN.  Help me start on a new path - literally and figuratively - and get me to Atlanta.  I'll be able to walk with strength, wear a costume that makes me look smokin', and mingle with actors and artists without feeling that I only have two minutes before I have to sit down and wipe the pain-sweat off my face.  This time, the focus won't be on my disability, but on ME, on who I am without the heavy burden of that awful pain.And with your help, I'm offering some awesome perks - goodies from Dragon*Con including lanyards and t-shirts, and, most exciting of all, signed autographs from some of your favorite celebrities.  How can you resist?  You'll aid me in realizing the new and improved me, and get some awesome wall candy, too.  :)  The money raised pays for my lodging, my weekend badge, and food (a friend got my plane ticket with frequent flier miles!) - SO JUST ABOUT $200 TO GO!!!  No ""fun"" money, just the basics.Your assistance will mean the world to me.  Every year, this convention is my Big Thing - I look forward to it every year, I plan for it, I talk for hours about it with my friends, and this year ... this year I can fully participate.  After everything I've been through, the horrible pain, the illnesses, the broken bones, the loss of my fur-babies, the struggle to keep going, to keep moving forward, Dragon*Con is a beacon to me, where I can walk straight and tall (I actually gained back half an inch after the surgeries!) and be a true part of the festivities.

<p>Update: Eric will be having his 5th facial laser proceedure October 23rd. Then we will schedule an actual date for his Facial reconstruction. Eric is going to need a release of his lip and the skin will be replaced beneath his mouth and part of his chin with skin grafts from his hip. For that proceedure we will be there for 1 week for recovery in another state away from family and friends. Our untimate goal is to bring Eric's 3 sisters with us to the hospital, so they can see where he has been going. also we are still in need of medical devices in eric bedroom to ease comfort after this painful surgery. Please... if you can't donate... please just considering sharing the link on FB with your friends. </p>
<p>Eric is a 5 year old burn survivor. Burns were sustained to 40% of his body. 30% were grafted using the skin from his back and hips.We are trying to raise funds to get Eric into healing programs, traveling expenses, and get Eric medical devices for his room that will be beneficial to his healing and comfort him after surgeries. As you can imagine the family has many expenses related to his injuries. They are lifelong. They are something they deal with everyday. Eric will face many surgeries in his life. He has had 7 surgeries so far and will have another major surgery in October. Today you have the opportunity to help the Rodriguez families situation for the better. We thank you in advance. No donation is to small. Every dollar will get us closer to our goal. </p>
The story below is a short story of Little Erics experience writen by his mother:<br/><p>There are days in the life of many people that they can say changed their life in the blink of an eye. Imagine if you would for a moment that that day was today for you. If you knew it was coming... would you do anything different? Or if that day was destiny would it matter if anything you did could have changed it? That day for me and my family was July 19th, 2011.</p>
<p>The day began as any other day. My family woke up in the morning. I, myself, was not feeling well and took the day off of work. I shortly after went to the hospital leaving my children in the hands of my husband. After several bags of fluid for hydration, I was discharged and my husband came to pick me up. My husband and I went to pick up our children at my brother in law's house. They invited us to stay for dinner because they knew I was not up for cooking a meal for my husband and 3 children. We gratefully accepted and had a normal summer dinner of hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill. As we finished our summer fun meal it was suggested that we start a bonfire. My children were just finishing up and we were all heading outside. My son however asked for one more hotdog and I gave it to him with instructions to come outside as soon as he had finished.</p>
<p>Have you ever gotten that bad feeling in the pit of your stomach like you are outside of yourself looking in and everything screams for you to do something? But I didn't. I left him in the house to join my family outside... convinced it was only in my mind and everything was going to be fine. What’s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>I joined my family outside. I walked past the bonfire that my family had already started a few feet from the front porch. I walked down to the driveway to join my sister-in-law. It was a normal day. The sun was setting. It was almost over. Then I heard a thunderous noise and flash behind me. It made my soul tremble. I shuddered as I turned around to see flames as high as the trees. Not realizing what had happened. Then out of the flames I saw my brother in law running. The flames followed his body. I screamed, ""Stop, drop, and roll"". He dropped to the ground and the flames were out. I was scared but walked slowly towards him and closer to where the fire had been. Then my mind froze again. The flames were moving. I stopped in my tracks to realize those flames were my son. My little boy… my baby. He was crying for me, and I was frozen.</p>
<p>My husband acted quickly grabbing my son and throwing him to the ground. I walked towards him with my hands up into the air. It was as if I was praying in my mind to forget the images that just passed my eyes. I found myself over his body as several people attempted to put the flames out from his clothes and hair. I hovered my body over his. My husband took him from beneath me and carried him into the house. Just then someone screamed to put him in the shower. My mind finally kicked into gear. I began to think that we needed to get his clothes off and call 911. I began in to the house telling my husband to get his clothes off and had the phone in my hand to call 911.</p>
<p>I remember being scared to look in the room where my son was. I was even more scared when I went into that room and looked at him. I had convinced myself that maybe it wasn't that bad. He was only on fire for a short period of time. But what I saw stung my eyes. My 3 year old child was naked with burns from his forehead to his feet. His skin melted. His hair half gone. Tears were swelling in his eyes, and mine. My body shook. I yelled to my husband, ""We need to get him to the hospital."" 911 operators still had not answered at this time and I was terrified.</p>
<p>We carried him to our van and my husband placed him in my arms. We drove for 15 minutes before reaching the hospital that was 5 minutes away. In our panic we couldn't find the local hospital; forgetting which way to take to get there. We drove 70 in a 30 area... passing several police vehicles who never stopped us. We honked our horn and finally we came to the hospital. I jumped out of the van with my son in my arms leaving the passenger door open. I found a door but it was locked. I screamed in horror. ""Somebody please God help me."" Just then a nurse leaving for the night came out and yelled ""follow me"". My husband was a few feet behind.</p>
<p>I couldn't breathe. I couldn’t say anything. I just followed her to an ICU room and laid my child's body on the bed. He looked up at me and said, ""Mommy it hurts"". His body was so weak and frail. I finally let out my first tear. The doctors and nurses rushed in with gauze and saline. His body began to swell. I was helpless. I am a nurse. It’s what I do... I take care of people and I couldn't help him. At that moment I knew my son’s life was in their hands.</p>
<p>I stood there as they tried to save my son’s life. I didn't know what to do or say. I looked across the room and there in the corner was my husband. He was standing there with a single tear in his eye. He was trying so hard to stay strong. But I could tell from his look he was broken. His face and heavy heart broke mine. I began to weep for my son. Not knowing if he would live or die. I couldn't control my tears. I wept as they catheterized my son and kept his body moist with sterile saline and warm with blankets. The nurse grabbed my hand and told me I needed to be strong for my son. I decided to leave the room for a moment. I couldn't face this alone.</p>
<p>I called my mother and my pastor. My mother was in tears and said she would be there soon. I cried to her ""mom why did this happen to me and my baby?"" Her answer still chills me to this day. She with a hint of anger replied, ""Because you’re always in the wrong place at the wrong time."" My Pastor told me he needed to pray. We hung up and felt sure he fell to his knees to pray for my son. I was shortly after told my son needed to be transferred to the local pediatric hospital.</p>
<p>The ambulance came to transport my son and me. My husband followed shortly after in our family van. I sat in the front of the ambulance while two EMT's; a man and woman; watched over my son in the back. I began to pray and try to bargain with God. Saying out loud “God please don't take my son away. I can't live without him. I promise his life to be dedicated to you if only you would spare his life. I will not live without him I can't please God please."" I repeated the same prayer over and over louder as we drove. The louder I prayed it seemed the faster we drove. I could tell the ambulance driver was as scared for my son as I was. Finally we made it to the hospital.</p>
<p>When I got out of the ambulance there were several people waiting. They took my husband and me inside where I met my mother, step father, and two sisters. We were joined, shortly after, by my step mother, mother in law, and two members of my church. I just kept repeating to them... If I didn't go to the hospital that morning this never would have happened. If I didn't let him have a second hot dog he would have been with me.  In my heart I knew it was not my fault. But my mind screamed... your his mother... it’s your job to protect him... you failed at your job.</p>
<p>While planning his course of care I heard the doctors say the name Shriner's several times. They were telling me they were in contact with Shriner's and were waiting on them to call to plan his next move. The doctors examined his body and stated they would be transferring him to the ICU. Over 60% of his body was estimated to be burned but they wouldn't know more until the blisters were removed from his body and they were able to see the damage. Pockets of fluid covered the whole front of his body. I took my family one at a time to see him. Then when they all had viewed him over it was time to transfer to the ICU.</p>
<p>After we reached the ICU we were immediately told he would have to be transferred to Shriner's Burn hospital in Cincinnati. I was shocked as the doctors told me his burns were too extensive for the hospital to handle, and he needed to go to another hospital. This time he would fly, and we were unsure if I would be able to go with him. I sent my husband home to pack. We were going to Cincinnati.</p>
<p>At 4am the transport arrived and was able to relieve my fears of leaving him. I was able to fly with my son to Cincinnati, but my husband would have to find his own way there. I found out we were taking a private plane and would take only a few hours to arrive at the airport. We took an ambulance ride to the local airport and they loaded us up on the plane. I remember the first question I asked before we took off was, ""where is Cincinnati?"" ""Ohio,"" replied the EMT.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Shriner's hospitals for Children in Cincinnati on July 20th. I felt lost. I didn't know exactly where I was. I was alone with no money, or clothes. I didn't know what was going to happen or where I would stay. A social worker guided me into a room and stated that she knew I had been through a lot, but they would provide a room for me and my family. They would provide money for food. And that I was at the best place I could be for my son. I finally let out a sigh of relief. I could for a second concentrate back on my son and his care.</p>
<p>They cleaned the blisters off of my son's body and estimated 40% of his body to be burned. He had no signs of smoke inhalation so he would not require a tracheotomy. We would have to treat him aggressively and in sterile conditions to prevent infection. Now it was a waiting game. It was a game my husband would soon join me for as he proceeded to Cincinnati overnight on a bus.</p>
<p>Seven days after we arrived at Shriner's, my son Eric celebrated his 4th birthday. We were told Eric would require surgery. They would use the skin from his back and hips as a donor to graft to his entire chest, shoulder, arm, and both upper legs. From his chest down to his knees would require grafting. After 2 painful surgeries he was deemed able to go home. We spent 18 of the longest days of our lives in that hospital, and though we are so grateful to them for their care and compassion, we were even more so happy to finally go home.</p>
<p>At home waiting for us was our daughters. (Lillian age 5, Violet age 2, and Nina age 14) They gently hugged him as they cried tears of joy to see their brother and parents. For 18 days I couldn't worry about my children at home. I couldn't even think of them, because it took everything in me to be there for my son. Finally I could hold my baby girls again. I missed them more than words can say. We had never been away from them for more than a couple of days. My children are my life and my life felt a little more complete at that moment.</p>
<p>We since have been back to Shriner's 8-10 times for checkups and follow-up surgeries. Eric always learns a new song each time we go. The nurses remember him as the boy with the smiling face who always says thank you. He would tell the nurses he loved them; even after a painful procedure. He is the boy who tried to make everyone laugh even when he was in pain himself. My son is incredibly strong. He has a sense of strength that I wish I had half of. I don't think I could ever deal with the pain he has overcome. And I don't know what in life I did to deserve such a wonderful boy.</p>
<p>My husband and I take every day one at a time. We don't know what to expect. We never know what’s around the corner. We do however appreciate every moment we spend with all our children. At first we were angry with God... but realized it was God who pulled him through and allowed him more time with us. We are so thankful for every moment with each of our children. My son, myself and my family is stronger because of what we have had to endure. And in a weird way I am thankful that we have joined together to overcome our pain and fears.</p>
<p>Every year there are over 1 million burn injuries in the US alone. Everyday hundreds of children are taken to the hospital for burn injuries. Eric’s story is not special, but he is a very special little boy. He likes to be called buddy. He believes he is a Hero (and he is to us). His favorite Super hero is Spiderman. He loves his mother, father, and sisters. And he never gives up an opportunity to let us know it. He is remarkable enough to smile thru his pain. He is a strong willed boy with a need just to live life to its fullest. He is Eric, my son, and a burn survivor.</p>

Our untimate goal is to bring Eric's 3 sisters with us to the hospital, so they can see where he has been going. also we are still in need of medical devices in eric bedroom to ease comfort after this painful surgery. Please... if you can't donate... please just considering sharing the link on FB with your friends. 
Eric is a 5 year old burn survivor. Burns were sustained to 40% of his body. 30% were grafted using the skin from his back and hips.We are trying to raise funds to get Eric into healing programs, traveling expenses, and get Eric medical devices for his room that will be beneficial to his healing and comfort him after surgeries. As you can imagine the family has many expenses related to his injuries. They are lifelong. They are something they deal with everyday. Eric will face many surgeries in his life. He has had 7 surgeries so far and will have another major surgery in October. Today you have the opportunity to help the Rodriguez families situation for the better. We thank you in advance. No donation is to small. Every dollar will get us closer to our goal. 
The story below is a short story of Little Erics experience writen by his mother:There are days in the life of many people that they can say changed their life in the blink of an eye. Imagine if you would for a moment that that day was today for you. If you knew it was coming... would you do anything different? Or if that day was destiny would it matter if anything you did could have changed it? That day for me and my family was July 19th, 2011.
The day began as any other day. My family woke up in the morning. I, myself, was not feeling well and took the day off of work. I shortly after went to the hospital leaving my children in the hands of my husband. After several bags of fluid for hydration, I was discharged and my husband came to pick me up. My husband and I went to pick up our children at my brother in law's house. They invited us to stay for dinner because they knew I was not up for cooking a meal for my husband and 3 children. We gratefully accepted and had a normal summer dinner of hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill. As we finished our summer fun meal it was suggested that we start a bonfire. My children were just finishing up and we were all heading outside. My son however asked for one more hotdog and I gave it to him with instructions to come outside as soon as he had finished.
Have you ever gotten that bad feeling in the pit of your stomach like you are outside of yourself looking in and everything screams for you to do something? But I didn't. I left him in the house to join my family outside... convinced it was only in my mind and everything was going to be fine. What’s the worst that could happen?
I joined my family outside. I walked past the bonfire that my family had already started a few feet from the front porch. I walked down to the driveway to join my sister-in-law. It was a normal day. The sun was setting. It was almost over. Then I heard a thunderous noise and flash behind me. It made my soul tremble. I shuddered as I turned around to see flames as high as the trees. Not realizing what had happened. Then out of the flames I saw my brother in law running. The flames followed his body. I screamed, ""Stop, drop, and roll"". He dropped to the ground and the flames were out. I was scared but walked slowly towards him and closer to where the fire had been. Then my mind froze again. The flames were moving. I stopped in my tracks to realize those flames were my son. My little boy… my baby. He was crying for me, and I was frozen.
My husband acted quickly grabbing my son and throwing him to the ground. I walked towards him with my hands up into the air. It was as if I was praying in my mind to forget the images that just passed my eyes. I found myself over his body as several people attempted to put the flames out from his clothes and hair. I hovered my body over his. My husband took him from beneath me and carried him into the house. Just then someone screamed to put him in the shower. My mind finally kicked into gear. I began to think that we needed to get his clothes off and call 911. I began in to the house telling my husband to get his clothes off and had the phone in my hand to call 911.
I remember being scared to look in the room where my son was. I was even more scared when I went into that room and looked at him. I had convinced myself that maybe it wasn't that bad. He was only on fire for a short period of time. But what I saw stung my eyes. My 3 year old child was naked with burns from his forehead to his feet. His skin melted. His hair half gone. Tears were swelling in his eyes, and mine. My body shook. I yelled to my husband, ""We need to get him to the hospital."" 911 operators still had not answered at this time and I was terrified.
We carried him to our van and my husband placed him in my arms. We drove for 15 minutes before reaching the hospital that was 5 minutes away. In our panic we couldn't find the local hospital; forgetting which way to take to get there. We drove 70 in a 30 area... passing several police vehicles who never stopped us. We honked our horn and finally we came to the hospital. I jumped out of the van with my son in my arms leaving the passenger door open. I found a door but it was locked. I screamed in horror. ""Somebody please God help me."" Just then a nurse leaving for the night came out and yelled ""follow me"". My husband was a few feet behind.
I couldn't breathe. I couldn’t say anything. I just followed her to an ICU room and laid my child's body on the bed. He looked up at me and said, ""Mommy it hurts"". His body was so weak and frail. I finally let out my first tear. The doctors and nurses rushed in with gauze and saline. His body began to swell. I was helpless. I am a nurse. It’s what I do... I take care of people and I couldn't help him. At that moment I knew my son’s life was in their hands.
I stood there as they tried to save my son’s life. I didn't know what to do or say. I looked across the room and there in the corner was my husband. He was standing there with a single tear in his eye. He was trying so hard to stay strong. But I could tell from his look he was broken. His face and heavy heart broke mine. I began to weep for my son. Not knowing if he would live or die. I couldn't control my tears. I wept as they catheterized my son and kept his body moist with sterile saline and warm with blankets. The nurse grabbed my hand and told me I needed to be strong for my son. I decided to leave the room for a moment. I couldn't face this alone.
I called my mother and my pastor. My mother was in tears and said she would be there soon. I cried to her ""mom why did this happen to me and my baby?"" Her answer still chills me to this day. She with a hint of anger replied, ""Because you’re always in the wrong place at the wrong time."" My Pastor told me he needed to pray. We hung up and felt sure he fell to his knees to pray for my son. I was shortly after told my son needed to be transferred to the local pediatric hospital.
The ambulance came to transport my son and me. My husband followed shortly after in our family van. I sat in the front of the ambulance while two EMT's; a man and woman; watched over my son in the back. I began to pray and try to bargain with God. Saying out loud “God please don't take my son away. I can't live without him. I promise his life to be dedicated to you if only you would spare his life. I will not live without him I can't please God please."" I repeated the same prayer over and over louder as we drove. The louder I prayed it seemed the faster we drove. I could tell the ambulance driver was as scared for my son as I was. Finally we made it to the hospital.
When I got out of the ambulance there were several people waiting. They took my husband and me inside where I met my mother, step father, and two sisters. We were joined, shortly after, by my step mother, mother in law, and two members of my church. I just kept repeating to them... If I didn't go to the hospital that morning this never would have happened. If I didn't let him have a second hot dog he would have been with me.  In my heart I knew it was not my fault. But my mind screamed... your his mother... it’s your job to protect him... you failed at your job.
While planning his course of care I heard the doctors say the name Shriner's several times. They were telling me they were in contact with Shriner's and were waiting on them to call to plan his next move. The doctors examined his body and stated they would be transferring him to the ICU. Over 60% of his body was estimated to be burned but they wouldn't know more until the blisters were removed from his body and they were able to see the damage. Pockets of fluid covered the whole front of his body. I took my family one at a time to see him. Then when they all had viewed him over it was time to transfer to the ICU.
After we reached the ICU we were immediately told he would have to be transferred to Shriner's Burn hospital in Cincinnati. I was shocked as the doctors told me his burns were too extensive for the hospital to handle, and he needed to go to another hospital. This time he would fly, and we were unsure if I would be able to go with him. I sent my husband home to pack. We were going to Cincinnati.
At 4am the transport arrived and was able to relieve my fears of leaving him. I was able to fly with my son to Cincinnati, but my husband would have to find his own way there. I found out we were taking a private plane and would take only a few hours to arrive at the airport. We took an ambulance ride to the local airport and they loaded us up on the plane. I remember the first question I asked before we took off was, ""where is Cincinnati?"" ""Ohio,"" replied the EMT.
We arrived at the Shriner's hospitals for Children in Cincinnati on July 20th. I felt lost. I didn't know exactly where I was. I was alone with no money, or clothes. I didn't know what was going to happen or where I would stay. A social worker guided me into a room and stated that she knew I had been through a lot, but they would provide a room for me and my family. They would provide money for food. And that I was at the best place I could be for my son. I finally let out a sigh of relief. I could for a second concentrate back on my son and his care.
They cleaned the blisters off of my son's body and estimated 40% of his body to be burned. He had no signs of smoke inhalation so he would not require a tracheotomy. We would have to treat him aggressively and in sterile conditions to prevent infection. Now it was a waiting game. It was a game my husband would soon join me for as he proceeded to Cincinnati overnight on a bus.
Seven days after we arrived at Shriner's, my son Eric celebrated his 4th birthday. We were told Eric would require surgery. They would use the skin from his back and hips as a donor to graft to his entire chest, shoulder, arm, and both upper legs. From his chest down to his knees would require grafting. After 2 painful surgeries he was deemed able to go home. We spent 18 of the longest days of our lives in that hospital, and though we are so grateful to them for their care and compassion, we were even more so happy to finally go home.
At home waiting for us was our daughters. (Lillian age 5, Violet age 2, and Nina age 14) They gently hugged him as they cried tears of joy to see their brother and parents. For 18 days I couldn't worry about my children at home. I couldn't even think of them, because it took everything in me to be there for my son. Finally I could hold my baby girls again. I missed them more than words can say. We had never been away from them for more than a couple of days. My children are my life and my life felt a little more complete at that moment.
We since have been back to Shriner's 8-10 times for checkups and follow-up surgeries. Eric always learns a new song each time we go. The nurses remember him as the boy with the smiling face who always says thank you. He would tell the nurses he loved them; even after a painful procedure. He is the boy who tried to make everyone laugh even when he was in pain himself. My son is incredibly strong. He has a sense of strength that I wish I had half of. I don't think I could ever deal with the pain he has overcome. And I don't know what in life I did to deserve such a wonderful boy.
My husband and I take every day one at a time. We don't know what to expect. We never know what’s around the corner. We do however appreciate every moment we spend with all our children. At first we were angry with God... but realized it was God who pulled him through and allowed him more time with us. We are so thankful for every moment with each of our children. My son, myself and my family is stronger because of what we have had to endure. And in a weird way I am thankful that we have joined together to overcome our pain and fears.
Every year there are over 1 million burn injuries in the US alone. Everyday hundreds of children are taken to the hospital for burn injuries. Eric’s story is not special, but he is a very special little boy. He likes to be called buddy. He believes he is a Hero (and he is to us). His favorite Super hero is Spiderman. He loves his mother, father, and sisters. And he never gives up an opportunity to let us know it. He is remarkable enough to smile thru his pain. He is a strong willed boy with a need just to live life to its fullest. He is Eric, my son, and a burn survivor.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>WHO ARE WE? </strong></p>
<p> Chi-square Technologies is providing an electronic technological concept for global portable medical records that will lower healthcare costs, provide better, quicker, safer medical care and in turn, save lives. We sell performance, vision, technology, process &amp; expertise. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/144/994/f1be825490ee1f92461ce60defcfcf24_large.png?1346812090"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong> WHAT IS OUR PRODUCT? </strong></p>
<p> The product we are presenting here is a multifunctional smart card. It carries all the critical personal information with you and with highest possible security. Three of its major roles are: </p>
<p> 1. Portable medical records - can deliver a summary medical record at the point of care with or without the Internet and act as a physical security key to access all previous episodes of care over time and across delivery systems, thereby creating a global longitudinal medical record. </p>
<p>2. Electronic insurance cards – can guarantee identity, store value and insurance benefits on the card and adjudicate health insurance right at your doctor’s office. </p>
<p>3. All in one cards - contain an electronic driver’s license, passport, voters ID, national ID &amp; portable medical record that can only be viewed by someone with an access card which provides appropriate credentialing for the specific application (police see a driver’s license, MD sees the medical record, etc).</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/145/103/c94a6b0bb8e106021972907e2f83a000_large.png?1346816861"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong> The system</strong> we adopted for this technology is called Makron®. Makron® is an encrypted virtual private network (VPN) that acts as an ATM banking system for medical record exchange connecting disparate EMRs (Emergency Medical Records). </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/144/990/51514877cdcb11cfb63d292ad54354cf_large.png?1346812001"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong> HOW DOES CHI-SQUARE HELP? </strong></p>
<p> We all agree there are many, many problems with our current healthcare system. Adverse drug interactions and adverse drug reactions kill 100,000 American men, women and children each year. This is equivalent to 500 Boeing 737 crashes per year and no one would stand for that. The only way to avoid adverse drug interactions is to have everyone connected to the same system and have that system run in real time. This is exactly what Chi-square does! </p>
<p> Fragmented records and medical record errors kill another 98,000 people each year in the US and cost billions in unnecessary healthcare expenses and lost productivity. X2 can effect a major drop in the number of deaths due to these medical errors and a corresponding drop in costs. </p>
<p> People are traveling more and if they fall ill, their records need to be with them. Ideally they should be available at the point of care, anywhere, anytime even in disaster situations like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Isaac when all services are down (power, phone &amp; Internet) and casualties are high. With the current systems this is not possible. With Chi-square’s system, your core medical records are always with you, stored in a chip embedded in a smart card. </p>
<p> X2 solves the four fatal faults: </p>
<p> 1. Privacy – the X2 PMR (Personal Medical Record) acts as a physical security key to your records. It cannot be accessed without your permission and you can have an accounting of whom saw what and when it was seen. </p>
<p>2. Disruption – no power, no Internet equals no records. The X2 PMR works both On-line and core data is available Off-line. </p>

WHO ARE WE? 
 Chi-square Technologies is providing an electronic technological concept for global portable medical records that will lower healthcare costs, provide better, quicker, safer medical care and in turn, save lives. We sell performance, vision, technology, process & expertise. 

 WHAT IS OUR PRODUCT? 
 The product we are presenting here is a multifunctional smart card. It carries all the critical personal information with you and with highest possible security. Three of its major roles are: 
 1. Portable medical records - can deliver a summary medical record at the point of care with or without the Internet and act as a physical security key to access all previous episodes of care over time and across delivery systems, thereby creating a global longitudinal medical record. 
2. Electronic insurance cards – can guarantee identity, store value and insurance benefits on the card and adjudicate health insurance right at your doctor’s office. 
3. All in one cards - contain an electronic driver’s license, passport, voters ID, national ID & portable medical record that can only be viewed by someone with an access card which provides appropriate credentialing for the specific application (police see a driver’s license, MD sees the medical record, etc).

 The system we adopted for this technology is called Makron®. Makron® is an encrypted virtual private network (VPN) that acts as an ATM banking system for medical record exchange connecting disparate EMRs (Emergency Medical Records). 

 HOW DOES CHI-SQUARE HELP? 
 We all agree there are many, many problems with our current healthcare system. Adverse drug interactions and adverse drug reactions kill 100,000 American men, women and children each year. This is equivalent to 500 Boeing 737 crashes per year and no one would stand for that. The only way to avoid adverse drug interactions is to have everyone connected to the same system and have that system run in real time. This is exactly what Chi-square does! 
 Fragmented records and medical record errors kill another 98,000 people each year in the US and cost billions in unnecessary healthcare expenses and lost productivity. X2 can effect a major drop in the number of deaths due to these medical errors and a corresponding drop in costs. 
 People are traveling more and if they fall ill, their records need to be with them. Ideally they should be available at the point of care, anywhere, anytime even in disaster situations like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Isaac when all services are down (power, phone & Internet) and casualties are high. With the current systems this is not possible. With Chi-square’s system, your core medical records are always with you, stored in a chip embedded in a smart card. 
 X2 solves the four fatal faults: 
 1. Privacy – the X2 PMR (Personal Medical Record) acts as a physical security key to your records. It cannot be accessed without your permission and you can have an accounting of whom saw what and when it was seen. 
2. Disruption – no power, no Internet equals no records. The X2 PMR works both On-line and core data is available Off-line. 
 3. Secure log-on – with X2, only one record at a time is exposed and it requires both an access card (who is looking) and a data card to grant permission. This protects against both external and internal hacking threats. 
4. Fragmentation – all episodes of care are listed on the card and the server so the patient does not have to remember. Every time you use the card, it is automatically updated with the previous episode of medical care. 
 In addition, the “X2 system” provides unique benefits to the 6 P’s: Patients, Providers, Pharmacists, Payers, Plans and Producers. X2 can reduce logistical costs (>10%), redundancy costs (>20%), and disease management costs (20-55%), saving $100 to $200 Billion per year and making national healthcare affordable.

<p>Peace y'all! My name is Tracee Thomas and I am the creator behind Yoga is for Everyone. I am a certified Kemetic Yoga instructor and have been practicing yoga for more than 7 years. When my mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer in 2007, my love affair with yoga intensified and I began to practice daily. Yoga gave me the peace of mind and strength to support my mother while she battled cancer.</p>
<p><br/>I created Yoga is for Everyone because of my personal experience with the benefits of yoga and working with with people who have transformed their lives and health through the practice of yoga. In my travels and teaching,  I come across many individuals who were interested in trying yoga, know about the benefits but are afraid to begin, or believing that yoga if for people of a certain height, weight, shape, or size. These misconceptions are most prevelant in communities that would be postively impacted by the benefits of yoga.</p>
<p>Yoga is for Everyone will be a critical contribution in communities where stress, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure are major killers. Your contribution will make sure that we are able to get this video into the hands of those who need it the most and spread the healing power of yoga to everyone.</p>
<p>Yoga is for Everyone is a professionally produced instructional workout DVD, filmed on location by Producer Extraordinaire, Nykole Tyson of NT Media Productions. The quality, the imagery, the love and partnership that went into this project is evident in the quality. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000 to cover the final costs of marketing and distributing the DVD. Your contribution will allow us to build a website, design and create packaging for the film, compensate the artists who contributed to the film, as well as marketing and distribution of the film. By donating or pre-ordering a copy of the DVD, you will allow us to achieve our goal of launching Yoga is for Everyone this Spring!</p>
<p>You can donate as little as $5 to support the campaging and for a minimum of $25, you will recieve an advanced copy of Yoga is for Everyone!</p>
<p>If, for some strange reason, our goal is not met, donated funds will go to covering the immediate needs of distribution of the DVD.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The positive benefits of yoga have been studied by medical doctors around the world. After just once class, yoga can increase relaxation and decrease stress. Yoga has been proven to lower incidents of heart disease, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as reduce the risk of stroke.  Yoga also effects mental health, with studies showing a relationship to improved self image, a positive effect on learning and memory, as well as other conditions including insomnia and depression.  With so many people suffering with these conditions, please join me in making this practice accessible to everyone. I want to show that you do not have to be a granola eating, Burkenstock wearing gymnast to practice yoga (not that there is anything wrong with being a granola eating, Burkenstock wearing gymnast!)</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">With practice, you could soon ""out drive"" your golfing buddy straight down the fairway, over 275 yards!  But distance isn't the whole game. When it comes to distance, accuracy to the green, or precision in the net, <strong>CHOT</strong> creates the perfect challenge for beginners and seasoned slingers alike.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>CHOT</strong> is a professional slinging sport played on a golf course. It’s similar to golf, except <strong>CHOT</strong> uses slings instead of clubs, and an oblong ball instead of a round one. Like golf, your objective is to propel your ball to each hole in the fewest number of slings – only your goal isn’t the hole; it’s a circular net attached to the hole’s flag.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>CHOT® can be played Side by Side with Golf!</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">You can play <strong>CHOT</strong> while your buddy plays golf beside you. You’ve got slings – he’s got clubs. You can play both great sports side by side – <em>simultaneously!</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><em>_______________________________________________</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>An Ancient Sport for the Modern Age</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">Anciently, slings were used by warriors and hunters with deadly precision. They could hurl their “missiles” within a hair’s breadth of their targets. These carefully prepared missiles were oblong with narrow ends. <strong>CHOT</strong> balls are crafted after this manner, providing a skilled slinger with incredible velocity and accuracy.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">A <strong>CHOT</strong> ball doesn’t hook or slice like a golf ball will. It spirals straight through the air like a football. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong><em>CHOT is an adrenaline rush! It’s easy to learn and thrilling to master! </em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong><em>________________________________________</em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>CHOT® Equipment</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">Players employ 3 different length slings (driver sling, mid-range sling, putter sling) to hurl a uniquely designed <strong>CHOT</strong> ball into a 13 inch net attached to each flag on the green. A special <strong>CHOT</strong> glove is worn to protect the middle finger of the slinging hand. Slings are easily carried on <strong>CHOT</strong> belt clips. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>CHOT</strong> equipment is significantly less than golf equipment, and effortless to pack around the golf course.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>Major Benefits to Golf Courses </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">With the economic downturn, golf courses across the nation are struggling to stay open. The US Professional <strong>CHOT</strong> Association (USPCA) has produced a sport that will re-populate golf courses. With a whole new game, comes a whole new athlete and a whole new fan base. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">By combining the “gladiator” aspect of <strong>CHOT</strong> and the “executive’s"" game of golf, we have given golf course owners a new vertical market to increase demand of play without compromising their course layout, architectural design, or tee times. Another bonus – <strong>CHOT</strong> Gladiators don't leave club divots on the course!<strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>CHOT® as a Global, Professional Sport</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">There are over 16,000 golf courses in the United States alone. As licensed <strong>CHOT</strong> courses pop up across the nation, other countries will join in the game. The USPCA is strategically positioning itself to make <strong>CHOT</strong> a global professional sport.</p>

                                                                                    The ""GLADIATOR"" spirit of SLINGING with GOLF for a WHOLE NEW SPORT!

 
Introducing...CHOT®!

 
Executive Golfers – meet the CHOT Gladiator!
With practice, you could soon ""out drive"" your golfing buddy straight down the fairway, over 275 yards!  But distance isn't the whole game. When it comes to distance, accuracy to the green, or precision in the net, CHOT creates the perfect challenge for beginners and seasoned slingers alike. 
CHOT is a professional slinging sport played on a golf course. It’s similar to golf, except CHOT uses slings instead of clubs, and an oblong ball instead of a round one. Like golf, your objective is to propel your ball to each hole in the fewest number of slings – only your goal isn’t the hole; it’s a circular net attached to the hole’s flag.
_______________________________________________
 

 
CHOT® can be played Side by Side with Golf!
You can play CHOT while your buddy plays golf beside you. You’ve got slings – he’s got clubs. You can play both great sports side by side – simultaneously!
_______________________________________________
 
An Ancient Sport for the Modern Age
Anciently, slings were used by warriors and hunters with deadly precision. They could hurl their “missiles” within a hair’s breadth of their targets. These carefully prepared missiles were oblong with narrow ends. CHOT balls are crafted after this manner, providing a skilled slinger with incredible velocity and accuracy.
A CHOT ball doesn’t hook or slice like a golf ball will. It spirals straight through the air like a football. 
CHOT is an adrenaline rush! It’s easy to learn and thrilling to master! 
________________________________________
 
CHOT® Equipment
Players employ 3 different length slings (driver sling, mid-range sling, putter sling) to hurl a uniquely designed CHOT ball into a 13 inch net attached to each flag on the green. A special CHOT glove is worn to protect the middle finger of the slinging hand. Slings are easily carried on CHOT belt clips. 
CHOT equipment is significantly less than golf equipment, and effortless to pack around the golf course.
Major Benefits to Golf Courses 
With the economic downturn, golf courses across the nation are struggling to stay open. The US Professional CHOT Association (USPCA) has produced a sport that will re-populate golf courses. With a whole new game, comes a whole new athlete and a whole new fan base. 
By combining the “gladiator” aspect of CHOT and the “executive’s"" game of golf, we have given golf course owners a new vertical market to increase demand of play without compromising their course layout, architectural design, or tee times. Another bonus – CHOT Gladiators don't leave club divots on the course! 
CHOT® as a Global, Professional Sport
There are over 16,000 golf courses in the United States alone. As licensed CHOT courses pop up across the nation, other countries will join in the game. The USPCA is strategically positioning itself to make CHOT a global professional sport.

<h3>Hi! </h3>
<p>My name is Kaleigh and I am 26 years old. In 2008, I was diagnosed with a prolactinoma, which is a type of tumor on my pituitary gland, which is in the middle of my brain. In the easiest way to explain it, it basically makes my body think that I am pregnant. Not to mention it pushes against my optic nerve, making my vision worse and giving me a constant headache. At the end of 2008, I was able to get an MRI and see an endrocrinologist 2 times before I lost my insurance. Since then, I have not had treatment for this tumor. I was in college and could not get insurance and have been unemployed since, yet actively searching for a job; anything to get insurance! This tumor has caused 30 lbs of weight gain, loss of menstration (which means I can't have kids), and can possibly lead me to becoming permanently infertle and even possibly blind if the tumor causes enough damage to my optic nerve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am doing this because I don't have any other options right now. I have contacted various organizations seeking help, but since my tumor is benign, I have been denied help. I need to see a doctor very badly, and possibly need to have another MRI since it has been so long. MRIs are not cheap and neither are doctor visits. The medications I was on before was $250 a month and that was WITH insurance, so it will be the same or more without. But I'm just reaching out for any kind of help I can get. I am young and do not want this tumor to control my body and life anymore. Plus, I do not want it to make me inferitle so I won't have the choice of having my own children. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can not donate, that is fine, I know times are hard. But spread the word; share with your friends or anyone you know. I appreciate any and everything because it will all go towards the outrageous amount of money I will need in order to even get a doctor's appointment.</p>
<p> $5000.00 is a small portion of what I will end up needing (MRIs, Blood work, Multiple Dr visits, Medications), but I figured it is a start. I know I'll end up needing more, but this will help give me a start.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Update 7/23: If anyone has anything personal to ask or share, please send it in a message, not a comment being rude. Also, since going public, someone has reached out to me and told me about UVA having a hospital/department dedicated to my type of tumor. I have sent them the application and paperwork they need in order to contact me about assistance and will be mailing my medical records and MRI CDs this week to their patient coordinator, who I have been emailing with. IF I do get financial assistance from them, this money will be used to pay them what I can and also for transportation to and from there, as I do not have an income at the moment. It will also be used, if I have surgery, for my mother to travel to stay with me during recovery. Thanks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Update 8/7: So I heard back from UVA &amp; the endocrinologist &amp; neurosurgeon want to see me! Earliest I could get in for everything is October 24; that day I will have a MRI at 10:00, see the endocrinologist at 12, &amp; neurosurgeon at 12:30! I did qualify for some financial assistance, but will still be paying a certain amount towards visits, tests, and possible surgery. I also still need to raise money for that, travel costs (and everything that comes with travel, ex: food, gas, tickets, rent a car ((if needed)) and so on), not to mention, my mom will be taking time off of work to come, especially if I have surgery, so she will be missing work/pay. Thank you for all of the support so far! I'm thankful this is going to be happening &amp; still need to raise funds, so don't forget to share with your friends!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!</p>

<h3>Hi, my name is Diane. James and I are from Colorado. I don't know what else to do but tell our story, briefly. It is unreal what we went through. My son James was born with Down's Syndrome and physical problems that required him to endure 20 operations by age 16.  I slept in a hospital chair most of those years. James' Dr.'s wanted us to move near sea level so he could breathe without oxygen. We moved to North Carolina to be near my other daughter. I felt I needed to be near her after losing my oldest daughter to double pneumonia. We moved into a condo in Winston-Salem that the owner said was a clean enviroment after expressing the Dr.'s and my concerns about James. I trusted him, signed the lease and moved in. After a few weeks, James seemed weaker, started coughing, wheezing, his eyes were swollen and his nose was runny. I started feeling sick, too, and could smell a musty odor in the kitchen. I told the Landlord, he came out and and said all was well. I turned to a Licensed Mold Inspector who took samples. They turned out to be Black Mold and 2 other toxic types. I was later told by the Landlord's plumber that he knew of leaks between the walls of the condo from the upstairs toilets but did not want to incur the expense of tearing the walls down and rebuilding them, since they were saturated with three to four different types of mold, even though the leaks were fixed the walls had already been damaged.  We left the place after over 2 years of breathing these toxins and hired a lawyer to go after the Landlord. The attorney assured me of his knowledge of mold cases and required a $2,500.00 retainer from me. Over a year went by with little response from the attorney. I finally had to fire him, he did nothing on our behalf. When I went to his office to get my money back, he'd left town. I was devastated and had to go through months of red tape and trips to the State Bar, who eventually refunded the retainer from a fund. The attorney was dis-barred and had no malpractice insurance. The Statute of Limitations is near expiration, the mold report was in his files which I could not get back. All this time, we remained sick and untreated. James nearly died several times from bacterial pneumonia and lost all his teeth. I stay sick and foggy all the time from the exposure. James likes to eat and watch movies. He's lived off baby food for 2 years and going downhill. I can't get help from any Dr's, they seem to know nothing about mold effects. The only few I found want thousands of dollars upfront to begin treatment. James needs some teeth so he can eat solid food again.  We are near the bottom, and I fear losing my son due to the criminal acts of the landlord and the attorney. I can't believe this could be allowed to happen to a helpless little boy who's suffered all his life. Please help us,  thank-you, Diane Hendrix </h3>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Fitness Hero is a great way to get in shape and we are excited to finally announce the creation of our fun and custom designed <strong>AVATARS!</strong>  </p>
<p>For years, we have dreamed about creating a life like Avatar that would evolve with the user and could resemble the goals and strides our users make on a day-to-day basis.  Our Avatars will become an interactive aspect that takes fitness training to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Creating this interactive piece to personal training is more than just about entertaining our users, but rather motivating our users to train harder, achieve more and even reach a level that they have not been able to reach before.</p>
<p>Avatars can be customized with clothing, skin color, appearance and will even evolve physically with the user, as they obtain their fitness goals.  But we felt that wasn't enough!  Avatars hold secret power-ups and gifts that users can obtain by meeting their daily and weekly goals.  From free personal training sessions, workout tools and products, to fun entertaining power-ups, such as cool accessories, celebration videos and more.  All you have to do is achieve your goals to play.</p>
<p>Fitness Hero believes that exercise and health should be about FUN!  Most fitness programs, videos and home equipment lack the essential entertainment value to really keep you going and coming back for more, so we were determined to do something different.</p>
<p>So, how do we pull this off?  By developing a game version that interacts with the user, you are in total control of your Avatar's results.  You are the driving factor of whether your Avatar will evolve, or fall off into Avatar destruction.  Our developers have worked hard on creating a concept that can be duplicated, yet customized, with the hopes to maximize the users experience, thus creating a longer lasting, more satisfactory fitness experience that will last throughout the year.</p>
<p>We have come a long way in developing the Fitness programs and back-bone to make this gaming version of Fitness Hero a success and now we need your help to bring us home.  Through this indiegogo project, our goal is to raise enough money to complete the creation of our dream.  We have set our minimum goal with this kickstarter at $5,000, but we are shooting to raise a full $20,000 with this project.  $5,000 will complete the essential framework necessary to bring these Avatar Characters alive, but $20,000 will create the identity aspects that make these Avatars come fully to life and interact on a customized basis.</p>
<p>Every donation counts and we now need your support to make this happen.  If you have questions, please don't hesitate to contact us directly.  </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for all your support!!</p>
<h2>Challenges We Face</h2>
<p>Every project has some risks and challenges and ours are very animation related. Our goal is to create ""life like"" Avatars that can evolve digitally while the user creates a more healthy and fit lifestyle. With any digital world, creating a customizable human figure can be challenging and making movements and body components can take some planning and lot's of story boarding.</p>
<p>Our team has put in a tremendous amount of time in the design, character features and planning of the various phases, every one of our Avatars will go through in order to come out looking their best. We are confident that with enough time and effort, we can make these characters exactly what we want and with your support, we will have the software and expertise necessary to make the final leg of this project successful.</p>
<p>With you involved, we can do this!!!</p>

Avatars can be customized with clothing, skin color, appearance and will even evolve physically with the user, as they obtain their fitness goals.  But we felt that wasn't enough!  Avatars hold secret power-ups and gifts that users can obtain by meeting their daily and weekly goals.  From free personal training sessions, workout tools and products, to fun entertaining power-ups, such as cool accessories, celebration videos and more.  All you have to do is achieve your goals to play.
Fitness Hero believes that exercise and health should be about FUN!  Most fitness programs, videos and home equipment lack the essential entertainment value to really keep you going and coming back for more, so we were determined to do something different.
So, how do we pull this off?  By developing a game version that interacts with the user, you are in total control of your Avatar's results.  You are the driving factor of whether your Avatar will evolve, or fall off into Avatar destruction.  Our developers have worked hard on creating a concept that can be duplicated, yet customized, with the hopes to maximize the users experience, thus creating a longer lasting, more satisfactory fitness experience that will last throughout the year.
We have come a long way in developing the Fitness programs and back-bone to make this gaming version of Fitness Hero a success and now we need your help to bring us home.  Through this indiegogo project, our goal is to raise enough money to complete the creation of our dream.  We have set our minimum goal with this kickstarter at $5,000, but we are shooting to raise a full $20,000 with this project.  $5,000 will complete the essential framework necessary to bring these Avatar Characters alive, but $20,000 will create the identity aspects that make these Avatars come fully to life and interact on a customized basis.
Every donation counts and we now need your support to make this happen.  If you have questions, please don't hesitate to contact us directly.  
Thanks in advance for all your support!!
Challenges We Face
Every project has some risks and challenges and ours are very animation related. Our goal is to create ""life like"" Avatars that can evolve digitally while the user creates a more healthy and fit lifestyle. With any digital world, creating a customizable human figure can be challenging and making movements and body components can take some planning and lot's of story boarding.
Our team has put in a tremendous amount of time in the design, character features and planning of the various phases, every one of our Avatars will go through in order to come out looking their best. We are confident that with enough time and effort, we can make these characters exactly what we want and with your support, we will have the software and expertise necessary to make the final leg of this project successful.
With you involved, we can do this!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><p></p>Spacefish is Chris' passion. The new design of this flashgun is his creation and it is work he is immensely dedicated to. The addition of the flexible neck not only gives the user more scope for creativity but also makes it fun to use. The project has been about making photography fun since day one. <br/><br/>Chris' drive and determination have been steering this project thus far, and now it has come to the point where we need your help. Spacefish needs to be tooled and produced for you guys to get it in your hands, and on your cameras. We ask that you give a little, give a lot, or give what you can to help spacefish get off the ground.<br/><br/>Our dream is to see spacefish on the shelves and in the hands of photographers and enthusiasts like you. To create a more fun environment for todays photographer and to make it easy and effective to light your images. <br/><br/>So, why crowd-funding? Why Indiegogo?<br/><br/>The Indiegogo community has been so supportive in the progress of many inspiring projects, making them a success and a reality. Unlike 'big company' campaigns we don't have an established company behind with masses funds to invest, we are a young start-up, UK company with limited funds. However Spacefish® has been designed from the very beginning to be inexpensive to produce and assemble, and mass production will lower the price further.<br/><br/>For this reason we hope to demonstrate that the market is ready for this kind of device. A crowd-funding campaign is for us, a good starting point, because it will act as a reality check for us, it will demonstrate the need for this in the photography world, and will spread the word about Spacefish, allowing us to gather resources and build a photographic community around it. We also believe that the future of photography is wide open to projects like this and we have so many ideas to give to it. <br/><br/>As a UK project Spacefish® needs the help of the very people that understand and appreciate the relevance of technologically-improved photographic equipment. Funds will be used to start-up the production process and R&amp;D for further product innovation and engineering, allowing us to ship Spacefish in approximately 4 months. <p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>We are so excited to be moving ahead with this project and striving to bring the Spacefish to your cameras as soon as we can.<br/><br/>As a business we have set ourselves some goals if this project is successful. We are looking to provide jobs to the local community and will hire, skilled and dedicated staff to further the Hink brand and release more products in the coming year. We are proud to be a UK business are pushing for the project to be made, not just in cheapest way possible, but the best. The Manufacture will be given only to the companies who can make the best of our design.<br/><br/>We hope you keep up to date with us as we go on.<p></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My best friend is pretty great. They work as a Case Manager at an AIDS resource center in Jacksonville, FL where they started and maintain a trans* support group. They are honest, loving and passionate about justice, and they volunteer feeding homeless animals on their day off. Here's the thing, they need some help funding their top surgery. Currently they use a binder that hurts their back and makes summer days in Florida miserable. If I had the money to help them myself, I'd give it to them it in a second, but alas...I am asking for your help.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise $3,250 for Bradley's surgery, which will hopefully take place in early 2014. The full cost is approximately $6,500, but they've been saving for a while and have been able to save up almost half of the cost. If I don't reach the entire goal, the money will still go to fund Bradley's top surgery, the surgery just will be delayed until they can save the rest (but i'll update you on the progress!). If I get more than the goal I will donate the rest of the money to another top surgery fund.</p>
<p>Bradley is a very skilled artist and likes to make stencils. For a small donation they'll send you a patch of the stencil of your choice from ones they've already made (check out their etsy store, which is also used to fund the surgery, <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/transhome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/shop/transhome</a> to choose which one you'd like), and for a larger donation they'll work with you to create a patch of your own likes.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</b>is a smart
affordable content-driven ambient lighting system.This technology enlarges the screen
by projecting a glow of light from 4 sides of the back of the screen onto the surrounding
wall.</p>
<p>It is the
first standalone device connected by all video input standards like:
<b>VGA, HDMI, DVI,  S-Video, Composite, Component.</b> Because of this, it doesn’t require any extra skills, no
configuration files and compatibility problems.  <b>AmbiVision </b>supports
all screen sizes<b> up to 100 inches </b>diagonally, and captures the screen from
all games, video players, applications and so much more.<br/></p>

This
device has a smart system of adjusting screen properties to the connected
source. After pluging  the  input signal, the device computes the best and the most
efficient processing properties to grab pixels. Due to this, it provides
support for all screens regardless of the resolution and video standard.<br/><b><br/>
</b><p><b>Ambivision adjusts itself to your room.</b></p><p>Thanks to a <b>wall-adaptive function</b>, the color of the light is perfectly aligned with the screen picture, regardless of the wall color.</p><br/>

your pupil needs to increase its diameter from up to 180 seconds for clearer
vision in the dark. In every movie, scenes switch from dark to bright hundreds

is a smart
affordable content-driven ambient lighting system.This technology enlarges the screen
by projecting a glow of light from 4 sides of the back of the screen onto the surrounding
wall.
It is the
first standalone device connected by all video input standards like:
VGA, HDMI, DVI,  S-Video, Composite, Component. Because of this, it doesn’t require any extra skills, no
configuration files and compatibility problems.  AmbiVision supports
all screen sizes up to 100 inches diagonally, and captures the screen from
all games, video players, applications and so much more.


This
device has a smart system of adjusting screen properties to the connected
source. After pluging  the  input signal, the device computes the best and the most
efficient processing properties to grab pixels. Due to this, it provides
support for all screens regardless of the resolution and video standard.
Ambivision adjusts itself to your room.Thanks to a wall-adaptive function, the color of the light is perfectly aligned with the screen picture, regardless of the wall color.

AmbiVision
creates a cinema-like atmosphere while watching the news, movies or games due
to an impression that the picture surrounds you from each side and
significantly increases the size of the screen. It's an especially great thing
for 3D screens for enhancing a 3D experience. Add a new dimension to your viewing experience with AmbiVision.
This shows how AmbiVision can simply extend your screen.People spend about 34 hours a week watching TV and much more while working on the computer. During
dark to bright scene changes, the pupil of the eye reacts by decreasing its’
diameter twice over within 5 seconds for better eye protection.  When the scene changes from bright to dark,
your pupil needs to increase its diameter from up to 180 seconds for clearer
vision in the dark. In every movie, scenes switch from dark to bright hundreds
of times. The result is that the muscles of your eyes are in constant tension
which can lead to vision impairment. Using
AmbiVision , the muscles of your eyes are less strained therefore your eyes
don't get tired while spending long periods of time in front of the screen.When
you turn off the screen, AmbiVision lights up for 10/30/60 seconds to escort
you safely to bed. Obviously you can still control the lights by remote control or touch buttons.By
the touch keys or remote control you can enable a mood mode: static or fluently
changing colors, which reduces your energy cost by replacing the lighting in the whole room to
energy efficient LED lights behind a screen. 



The secret for the
perfect design relies on proper composition of a light source and high
performance controller. Thanks to the digital WS2812B LEDs, we can create a
high resolution effect without making ""cable spaghetti"".
Contemporary
 monitors and TV's are modernly designed. Therefore, AmbiVision has to be 
designed in a modern and minimalistic style as well. Thanks to a high 
performance DSP chip, the controller can process a video stream without 
any delays.
Now
some solutions are available, but all require PC software, so the field of use
is limited. Additionally software does not capture the screen while gaming or
fullscreen  applications are on. Some solutions need extra plugins which
require expert knowledge to make configuration files properly. We are different.
DSP chip
analyzes video stream in real time. We use this feature to recognize black bars
while watching movies and automatically adjust capturing areas.

Predominantly HDMI input would require a high cost HDCP license and increases cost of
potential video signal converters. VGA input utilizes minimum external
components in the best economical way. We tested various connection scenarios
to achieve cooperation with almost all tuners(i.e: Dreambox), PCs, TVs,
Embedded Solutions (i.e: Raspberry Pi, Android based devices), Projectors, Games
Consoles (XBOX, PlayStation, OUYA) etc.If your device has HDMI (or another type of standard) and VGA outputs, then you can connect AmbiVision directly without any other components. 
A lot of TVs/AV receivers provide
SCART/S-Video/Composite/Component output. By using converters to VGA you can
connect to AmbiVision.This is  a situation when your master device provides only one output. In
this case you have to use splitter and (sometimes) the video converter.
The
installation of AmbiVision is very simple and takes only 6-8 minutes depending
on your screen size. The self-adhesive RGB LED strip is only 10 mm wide, and is
flexible and bendable. You can stick it to the 4 sides of your screen and bend
it at the edges easily. The adhesive material on the strip is good quality and
reusable. You can remove it and transfer the strip to another monitor.The
last step is setting up the number of LEDs at every side by the touch buttons. Unused
LEDs will be disabled automatically.

 The first $10,000 will help us to obtain enough money to be
able to get AmbiVision ready for production. Obviously larger  amounts
allow us to produce more devices at rates much lower than future retail prices.
That is why any contribution is quite important. Now we have a fully working
prototype built from final selected components, but some things need
improvements. We plan to use the most appropriated mass production methods for
packing manufacturing, manual creation and implement some firmware
improvements.  We will start shipping
in the latter part of March 2015.  Our
production facilities are capable of making about 1000 kits within 1 month.
Upon successful completion of the campaign, following the updates on this page or
our social media.

More examples:
Everywhere.
Free priority shipping for all backers regardless of the destination.  Depending on your location we include an
appropriate power plug adapter (EU/US/UK/AU) and a warranty card with a 1 year
period.
Q: Which
input sources are supported?
 VGA is default inputs, but with suitabled converter you can use almost
all inputs (HDMI, SCART, S-Video,DVI etc.)
Q: Do I need to configure the device before using?
Yes. You only need to enter the number of LEDs on each side of the screen.
Then, if you need, you can adjust the brightness, colors gamma, positions of
sensing areas, smart black bars detection and set the turn on time of 
""go to sleep"" light.
Q: Can my remote control
work with AmbiVision?
If your remote control is based on infrared emitting, it will work. Only remote controllers based on radios are not supported.
Q: Could I update
firmware of device when a new version is released?
Yes. It takes 2 minutes and requires basic knowledge of computers.
Q:
Do I have to turn off the device after I turning off the screen?
No. It happens automatically. AmbiVision recognizes a lack of video signals and
switches to low power mode. You can still turn on the mood mode by the touch
keys or remote control.Q: Does the device support HDCP?
Yes. The HDMI->VGA converter of the 
connectivity pack supports HDCP. If we meet an embedded HDMI input 
goal, AmbiVision will also support HDCP.Q: Can I extend the LED strip myself?
Yes. AmbiVision controls max. 250 LEDs. It is too much for any screen, but
people have unbelievable imagination...

Q: Does it support multiple screen modes?
One device can be connected to one screen. Thus, if you want to use AmbiVision
for more screens, you have to use one device for each screen.

Q: Does AmbiVision work regardless of the operating system/some plugins?
Yes. It doesn't use any application, thus the operating system is irrelevant. Robert Jaszczyk

It's always the first ingredient listed on the ingredient deck because it makes up the majority of the formula. Yet, the water in these products is a ""silent"" ingredient, adding little to no user benefit other than to mix the remaining ingredients together and to provide desired viscosity. Naturally, skin and water do not mix well due to the oils secreted by the skin. The polar properties of oil and water create an interaction that prevents water from being absorbed or utilized for hydration by the skin. Thus, the majority of skincare products currently on the market contain a small percentage of ingredients that are actually active in providing the user with targeted hydration benefits. So, what are you paying for?</p><p>HydrO18™ Activated Water™ technology treats the distilled water typically used in product manufacturing to change its compound structure to one that mimics that of oils. With this treatment, water is able to be mixed with the oils naturally produced by the skin in a manner that pushes water and its hydrating properties into the surface of the skin. For the first time ever, products manufactured with this water technology now have formulations with 70% active ingredients, 10 times more than those without this technology! With this contribution and pre-sale purchase, you can feel confident that you are buying a product that is working wholly for your skin's hydration and benefit. </p><p><i><strong>It's Clinically Proven!</strong></i></p><p>As is done with any product or technological development, clinical studies were done over a period of several years with the HydrO18™ Activated Water™ technology.

I applied to my face and lips, waited 15 minutes, then I rubbed it into my skin and slept with it on. Do you know how your skin feels when you stay in a hotel room? It feels dry, like all the moisture was sucked out of your skin overnight! That's the dry air blowing in the room. Well, when I woke up, I realized my face didn't feel like that at all! It was so soft and hydrated! I used it again after coming home from a long flight.

I used it in the morning the first time and washed it off to use my other steps. Second time I used it in the evening and left it on overnight. I have oily/combination skin; <i><strong>I could not believe how amazing my skin felt</strong></i>. I normally get really shiny midday and have to blot or reapply powder.

I am so impressed!"" - Pam Poliakoff, California ""I’ve used the new Apriori mask with ‘active water’, three times in the last week and it has made my face plumper.  As I age my skin has less elasticity and therefore looks thinner, gaunt and drawn down.  After this mask my skin is so soft and my face actually feels and looks more full.  Which by definition means younger!  Yeah!  Thank you for formulating this fine product!"" - Laurie Ford-Ferreira, California ""I love how the Celloxylin Moisture Extreme Hydrating Mask felt going on! It has a cooling sensation to it and I could feel it going into my skin. Very refreshing!! I almost feel like my skin was plumper. I used it in the morning the first time and washed it off to use my other steps. Second time I used it in the evening and left it on overnight. I have oily/combination skin; I could not believe how amazing my skin felt. I normally get really shiny midday and have to blot or reapply powder. I go all day and night without having to since I have been using the mask. Love it!!"" -Lisa Adam, Nebraska Refer your friends, earn FREE products! Now you can earn a FREE Celloxylin® Moisture Extreme, Hydrating Mask and More when you refer others to pre-order on Indiegogo too. Here's how:Create or Login to your account at Indiegogo.comUse the Share Tools to gain referral sales by January 5th, 2018:• Accumulate $500 in referral sales = Free Moisture Extreme, Hydrating Mask (ships in February) — $65 value • Accumulate $1,000 in referral sales = Free Moisture Extreme, Hydrating Mask & a Celloxylin In the Bag skincare set — $210 value • Accumulate $1,500 in referral sales = Free Moisture Extreme, Hydrating Mask + Free Celloxylin set In the Bag skincare set + Free PSR Next [Precision Skin Rejuvenator] —$315 value No purchase necessary!

<h3>Marlene's Mission to a New Kidney</h3>
<p>Marlene has battled with kidney failure for over 6 years and, while dialysis is keeping her alive today, it is a stuggle for her every day!  I know what she is going through because my mom was on dialysis when I was a kid.  I saw first-hand what it does to someone.  My mother was lucky - her brother donated his kidney to her, and she lived another 35 years with one donated kidney.  I would have lost my mother at a very young age if it weren't for the wonderful generosity of my uncle.  Back in those days healthcare was different, you didnt have to pay out-of-pocket monies for a transplant, insurance really helped those in need, but things are different now.</p>
<p>Marlene has touched many peoples lives, as a friend, sister, aunt, cousin, daughter, and wife.  She always thinks of others before herself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly to pay for the 'initial' fees needed for Marlene's transplant. </p>
