</div>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">This story is about a man who bound, raped and tortured my child for years before she disclosed her abuse to me in April of 1999. My daughter gradually began to reveal more and more details of her abuse including describing extremely graphic and disturbing details of murder. Over time I came to realize that her abuse was NOT about Pedophilia, but about Sadism and a child victim who fulfilled his Sadistic needs in between his kills.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">My story documents the charm, cunning and manipulative nature of a psychopath who's organization, skill and evolution has allowed him to get away with his crimes including escaping prosecution for what he did to my child. My story shares the obscure measures that this self proclaimed ""Genius"", took to surround himself with easy prey and to carry out his crimes against them without detection. It would be years before I could gather the strength to resume my fight for justice for my child and begin to piece together this spectacular story that links this deviant to the Zodiac Killer who continued to claim victims in British Columbia, Canada for the past 40 years.</span></p>

<p><strong></strong><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">Henning Lagies, the man whom I had met in my foster home at the age of 16 was a good friend of my foster father and was in the home nearly everyday.  I grew to know him over the two years that I had lived there, and after moving out of the foster home Henning would become like a father to me and eventually like a grandfather to my child over the 16 year period of our relationship.  Little did I know that this man was a predator and in hindsight I realized that he strategically placed himself in close proximity of where he could find victims who would be easy to prey on.  The fact that I was a foster child with no family or support systems allowed him to gain my trust and loyalty which he would use to keep me close to him and to eventually gain access to my child after I became a mother.  It was years that I spent time with this man who I also worked with at DND, that allowed him the ability to mould my mind, to take his word as gospel and to trust him more than anyone in the world.  I would never have imagined in my worst nightmares that this man whom I had loved and trusted without any hesitation, would be the man who would cast the ultimate betrayal upon me and my child and would subject my child to sadistic sexual abuse and expose my child to graphic and gory murder scenes.  Whether my child was actually present at these murders, or Henning implanted these acts of violence into her head, this story will share the most astonishing details that will reveal the fantasies of a depraved man whom I absolutely believe is a killer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">I still have audio of some of the murder stories that my child relayed to me and drawings of skinned female genitalia that she claimed she saw her abuser eat.  Henning was supposed to be a vegatarian and he often made a bit of a spectacle in public about being a vegetarian, which I now realize was just part of his act, a common theme that I would later come to realize was his way of creating an illusion as to who he really was.  My child also drew a picture of a ""Machine"", that she saw Henning put bodies into, which accurately portrayed a woodchipper, and she also drew a ""Tool"" that was actually a pair of plyers, that she claims Henning used to pull out a lady's teeth.  I tried to share these details with the RCMP, but the investigating officer wouldn't listen and the charges against Henning were eventually dropped and my child and I were left teetering in the aftermath of this man's crimes without any resolve.  The Vancouver Police Department did get involved regarding my child's murder stories and the Vancouver missing women, and set my child up with a play therapist which they paid for for 9 months.  Although the VPD believed my child was sexually abused they had no jurisdiction and there was never anything tangible for them to go on regarding the murders.  Eventually I began to unravel from the stresss.  My child ended up in foster care and I ended up on disability for several years, but gradually, through counselling, I was able to start digging myself out of the dark place that I had lived for so many years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">In 2007 I recognized the handwriting from Robert Graysmith's movie ""Zodiac"", as being the exact same style as Henning's writing.  I hadn't really known much about Zodiac at the time, other than it was a story we talked about as kids about some guy killing couples and the fact that he was never caught.  It wasn't until watching the movie in 2007 that I connected the strange coincidence about the handwriting appearing to match a man whom I had now believed was a killer since my daughter's disclosures of her sadistic abuse and depictions of murder in 1999.  I did a little research and I pulled what samples of Henning's handwriting I had to compare with Zodiac letters that I found on the internet, and I was amazed to see how closely Henning's writing resembled Zodiac's.  Not only that, but after reading numerous letters that were written by Zodiac, I was struck by the fact that Zodiac's linguistics also appeared to link Henning to being the Zodiac Killer.  Two things that really stood out for me was how Zodiac always used the word ""Shall"", as did Henning, and how Zodiac wrote in a letter to the editor ""Happy Christmass"", amongst a multitude of other phrasing and idealisms.  One year Henning had given me a card that said ""Happy Christmass"", spelled just like that.  When I told him that is now how you spell Christmas, he just shrugged.  Now here is a man with genius IQ and he doesn't know how to spell Christmas?  Not likely, but at the time I didn't know much about Zodiac so I never made the connection.  There would be much more that I would later discover, but not until years later when I accidentally stumbled across more details that possibly linked Henning to being the Zodiac Killer, as well as the BC Serial Killer who had been claiming victims in British Columbia for 40 years since Zodiac went out of site in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">In January of 2010  I began conducting research on our missing women from the Vancouver, Eastside as well as along Highway 16 now dubbed the ""Highway of Tears"", trying to find clues as to the murder stories that my child had relayed to me.  It was then that I accidentally stumbled across more details that points the suspect in the BC killings as possibly being the Zodiac Killer, simply killing equal distances North and South of the Canada/US Border and also in areas on both sides of the border where he had family living.  My research shows timelines that match to Zodiac as well as when killings began in BC and times the suspect had opportunity to kill and was in the vincinity of women who vanished in BC amongst a multitude of other circumstantial evidence.  Much of this information is documented on my blog, but there is much more than I could ever say in a blog and it will all be revealed in my book.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>
<p><em><strong><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: xx-small;"">Although the RCMP dismissed what happend to my child, subsequent reports from Children's Hospital would support that she was sexually abused.   The reports also show that her depictions of murder, cannibalism and exposure to extreme violence were documented and were not diagnosed as manipulation, or psychosis.</span></strong></em></p>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: small;"">The killer constantly changed his method of operating and openly admitted that murder was sport for him. T<span>he attacks occurred at dusk or after dark, on weekends, often around holidays, with different weapons and apparently with no motive save violence itself. Clearly, the killer wanted credit for them and he turned most of his rage against females.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><span>Possible motives were to prove his superiority, get attention, control the investigation, create a terroristic climate, and relive the crimes via media reports.</span> <span>Going after couples, which he did three times, could indicate that he was envious or jealous because he did not (or could not) have that kind of relationship. It might also have been to show that he was not afraid to confront a male, although the fact that he targeted three couples when he could have only shot lone females or lone males indicates resentment about relationships.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: small;"">He liked to ambush his victims, yet for him none of these incidents were high risk crimes. While they were out in the open, they were not risky. Even when he set himself up for a potential risk, by being interviewed by phone, for example, he usually withdrew. Yet it's possible that he believed he was taking a risk, so he could congratulate himself when he did not get caught. Maybe he viewed these crimes as proof of his skill in stealth. He might have fantasized about himself being more daring than he actually was. By all witness accounts, he appeared to be late twenties to early thirties, heavyset, strong, and aggressive. It wouldn't be surprising that his fantasies of being a skilled ""hunter"" grew from an immature and insecure mind.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: small;"">Nevertheless, the man who called himself the Zodiac was organized, intelligent and meticulous. If we take the reference to the Zodiac seriously, we find several symbols in his initial cryptogram that look like the symbol for Taurus the bull, which could identify his approximate birth date. He obviously liked astrology and might have viewed himself as fated by the stars. Those close to him would probably have heard him engage in knowledgeable discussions about astrological symbols and meanings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: small;"">Among the most engaging aspects of the crimes for him was to be able to taunt the authorities from a superior perspective and to watch the police make fools of themselves. This often indicates a person who feels uncertain about his intelligence, so to reassure himself, he plays games with others. The Zodiac needed to think he was smarter than even the best detectives, and he probably exaggerated the risks he took in order to affirm his smug sense of superiority. People who knew him would have been familiar with his arrogance, as well as his shortcomings and insecurity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: small;"">He used a lot of diversionary tactics, such as making threats that turned out not to be true, or posing cryptic mysteries. This is a form of what's called ""duping delight."" He's excited by duping others. The puzzles he presented probably meant nothing, but this man enjoyed knowing that a whole city full of people, as well as a number of law enforcement agencies, were at work on whatever code or clue he sent. That would have given him a thrill, knowing that the resolutions were merely dead-ends, and yet people would keep trying to find out what they meant. The closer they thought they were to identifying him, the more it would have amused him.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: small;"">He enjoyed the control he exerted because he was in charge; he was running the investigation, more or less, as though he was the supervisor. He might have had pretensions of being a police officer, but for some reason been barred from this profession. This way, with these threats, he got to order them about. When he moved from the Vallejo area into San Francisco for his murders, he acquired a greater venue for control, along with the ability to spread the terror and feel more powerful. For him, it was all about that. He exerted control over his victims, and he did the same with anyone who was concerned about becoming a random victim.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size: small;"">He especially enjoyed controlling the newspapers and the police agencies of a town the size of San Francisco. He liked knowing they got into tiffs over territory and investigative squabbles. To his mind, that was more evidence of how stupid they were, and each day that went by without them catching him reinforced this opinion and sense of superiority. Every communication he sent fueled that fire.</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left; display: block;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><big><span style=""color: #333333;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Organized offenders are psychopathic and antisocial, irrational but sane.</span> </span><span style=""color: #333333;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">They are indifferent to fellow humans, irresponsible, and self-centered. They are manipulative, deliberative, and full of guile but outwardly amiable as long as it suits his objective. In other words, this type of offender could truly be a pillar of the community, the patron saint of child or spousal abuse prevention, and the neighborhood's most willing handyman. All the while, he is also the bogeyman who stalks his community's women, tortures them, and snuffs out their last breath. He is equally convincing in both roles and this is why the news reports always show the community astonishment in phrases like, ""He was always such a nice guy."" <br/></span><br/></span><span style=""color: #333333; font-size: small;"">They are cunning and emotionless, which is how they can play both sides of the coin. When you have nothing emotional to invest in anyone, giving everyone exactly what they want takes nothing from you, but it can give you an advantage when you are trying to keep people from suspecting you are a compulsive murderer. This offender is extroverted, articulate, and highly narcissistic. He takes great care with his physical health and appearance. He will dress himself neatly whether in business or casual attire.<br/><br/>There will always be a specific stressor in the offender's life that precipitates the beginning of his murderous career. These can be related to finances, employment, a marriage, or any close relationship. While there are events that will trigger the leap to murder, the fantasy is what fuels and builds up the desire to commit the crime. Offenders of this type will spend years, a decade or more, constructing their fantasy world. They use their crimes to hone these fantasies and improve upon them in order to heighten their level of self-gratification.<br/><br/>This offender will perpetrate very deliberative crimes, thoroughly calculated and planned. Premeditation of these crimes will also typically include extensive stalking. He preys mostly on strangers so that he cannot be linked to their victims in any way. He will hunt far from work or home, but in an area he has surveilled and become intimately familiar with. The abduction and abuse of the victim will be perpetrated with as much precision and calculation as the predator has put into planning his clear escape. An organized sexual homicide will have multiple scenes: the location of initial contact or assault, the scene of death, and the body disposal site. This offender is socially adept and may con or persuade his victims into going with him willingly. He may pose as an authority figure, using a uniform that will disarm his victims such as that of a police officer. <br/><br/>Victimology for an organized sexual homicide suggests a female or adolescent male. The victim will be single, employed, and live alone. The offender's risk for this type of crime is higher if committed outdoors or during the day. The victim of this crime is not known to the offender, but is chosen because she meets criteria specific to the killer's psychological construct. In multiple, linked homicides, the similarities in appearance of the victims will be obvious. For example, all of Ted Bundy's victims (except the last one) looked just like his ex-fiancee.<br/><br/>This offender plans his murders, spends time targeting his victims, and displays control over the scene. He is methodical and orderly throughout all phases of the crime. The murders themselves are slow and sadistic for an experienced killer who is comfortable with his level of control over all factors. This type of offender is so in control of his surroundings that he can adapt to obstacles that occur during the commission of the crime in an outwardly calm manner. For example, the Zodiac killer was able to provide a dummy description of a dummy suspect when he came face to face with the police who were looking for him minutes after he'd shot a cab driver. Ed Kemper drove through a security gate at a college campus with two dying women in the car without raising any suspicion from the guards. These predators engage in staging to aid them in evading detection. The scene may be altered to appear careless or disorganized on purpose as a way to throw off the investigation. Secondary criminal activity may be staged to disguise the sexual homicide as some other type of murder.<br/><br/>He takes care not to leave fingerprints, semen, or spent cartridges and shells. They make an effort to erase all prints and other potential evidence. Sometimes these perpetrators will scrub the victim down with bleach, along with the bathroom and kitchen, to destroy any trace he may have left. Some have been known to go to the extreme of removing all of their body hair and mutilating the tips of their fingers to avoid mishaps or carelessness at the scene. Weapons are brought to the scene by the perpetrator and leave the scene with him. He will have a ""kit"" consisting of various items like tape, chains, ropes, or chemicals. Restraints reflect a methodical approach, providing order for the perpetrator prior to, during, and after the crime. The scene will appear controlled and planned out. All finger- and footprints will be removed. Regardless of the ridiculous notions spouted off on television or in movies, these predators DO NOT want to be caught. EVER. They put so much effort into assuring they will outsmart the police because they all want to follow in the footsteps of Zodiac and Saucy Jack.<br/><br/>This offender takes trophies to commemorate the success of his endeavor. They also serve as proof of his skill and control. These items will be used to help the perpetrator relive the fantasy he has acted out. He will conceal or dispose of the body in a location that is familiar to him, but not connected to the area where he lives or works. He will return to surveill the scenes and may inject himself into the investigation by being overly cooperative with law enforcement. Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, returned to the dump sites to have sex with the bodies of his victims over and over, until maggots invaded the body. This behavior serves a dual purpose: it keeps him apprised of the progress of the investigation while affording him the opportunity to relive the crime where it happened.</span></big></span></p>

<p><span id=""txt97134754""><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small;"">I started studying psychopaths when I was working in a federal prison for my internship about twelve years ago. I thought I was having success providing weekly therapy to a psychopathic pedophile. However, his diary got confiscated after eleven months of therapy, and it turned out his fantasies were getting more and more sadistic and he wrote that he planned to murder children upon release. Not exactly a therapy success story! I started to research both the violent behaviour of psychopaths and their incredible ability to deceive and manipulate others. My views have changed over that time in the sense that I now believe that psychopaths are extremely rational and know the difference between right and wrong. Earlier, I felt that psychopaths were impulsive and that somehow their bizarre behaviour was beyond their choice. Our research has challenged that idea. </span></span></p>

<p><span id=""txt97139833""><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small;"">I'm not sure if by ""close contact"" you mean a family member or acquaintance/work colleague. But either way, typically the person will come across as highly likeable and charming, even charismatic. However, this charm is superficial in the sense that it is all part of an acting job, intended to manipulate the other person. In other words, the individual's behaviour will ultimately contradict the friendly, charming mask. You will see a pattern of persistent lying and deception (from a young age) including false promises, a ""gift of gab"", callous behaviour, including taking advantage of and conning others, a sense of superiority, stepping on others to get ahead, promiscuous sexual behaviour, and an inability to form anything more than superficial bonds with friends or partners. Often, such individuals are described in a Jekyll and Hyde way, such as ""he was so likeable and friendly, a real class clown but then I got involved with him and found out the truth too late."" </span></span></p>

<p><span><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small;"">Dr. Stephen Porter: </span></span></p>
<p><span id=""txt97143254""><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: small;"">Great question and one we have been researching for some time. Psychopaths in my view do know right from wrong in the ""cognitive"" or rational sense, and even do as well on moral-reasoning tasks in the lab setting as the rest of us. A better question might be why don't most people NOT act on their immoral or even violent impulses. All humans have sexual, violent, and antisocial thoughts and impulses that they choose not to act upon because of our ""conscience"". We have empathy for others and we know we could not live with ourselves if we acted on the dark thought. Psychopaths don't have to worry about a conscience to stop them from doing violent crimes. Research suggests that some of their main motivations include calculated revenge, thrill-seeking and sex, pure greed, and do intimidate and gain power. Many of the violent psychopaths we have studied were inspired purely by getting a thrill. For example, our research shows that the vast majority of sex offenders who cross the line from children to adults or vice versa are psychopaths. When asked about this pattern, one fellow I assessed told me he simply got bored with one victim type and then would move to another type.</span> </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">In my theory I hypothesise how if Henning is the Zodiac Killer that he did not live in the San Francisco area, but traveled from the Vancouver, BC area to San Francisco where he had family.  My theory is that should Henning be the Zodiac Killer, that this was his beginning as a killer.  I would suspect that earlier murders such as Cheri Jo Bates was indeed Henning and I have documented some circumstantial evidence pointing Henning to being her killer as well.  I believe that Henning would have gone through great lengths in order to go undetected, thus traveling the approximate 1,000 miles from Vancouver, BC to San Francisco which allowed him to test the waters in an area where nobody would ever suspect that he would be the killer, and he did so in an area where he would have an alibi by saying he was in town to visit with his family should anyone have seen him.  If we look at the location of the killings in British Columbia, we will see this same pattern of a killer who travelled approximately 1,000 miles along Highways 5, 16 and 97 which is now known as the ""Highway of Tears"", and has been the location of where dozens of women have disappeared or been found murdered over the past 40 years.  The other parallel linking Zodiac to the BC Serial Killer shows how many of the BC killings again took place in an area where Henning had family living in the 108 Mile Ranch area along the Cariboo Highway (Hwy. 97).  Eerily the approximate location of the home Henning co-owned with his father there (secondary to his Vancouver residence), resembles the location of the Lake Herman Killings near San Francisco, California.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">Another coincidence is that Henning lives only 2.6 miles from the Pickton Pig Farm where Robert Pickton tortured and murdered women. It is thought that Pickton had an accomplice.... coincidental or linked? Regardless, Pickton proves that this type of crime does happen and the RCMP should have taken seriously the crimes committed against my child and the possibility that this man is a viable suspect re our missing women. I have repeatedly tried to notify the RCMP, media and missing persons organizations over the past two years about this man in regards to what he did to my child and the fact that he is a dangerous man who should be considered a suspect in the BC killings..... media and others are interested until they actually relay my story to the RCMP who obviously do all they can to downplay my story. Typical of what happend in the Robert Pickton case.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: medium;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">The ability to bring awareness to this story and the abundance of circumstantial evidence that points Henning to being the Zodiac Killer as well as the BC Serial Killer who has been claiming victims in British Columbia, Canada for the past 40 years.  This awareness could in turn warrant investigation through the US and Canadian authorities which may result in the prosecution of the offender.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">The ability to possibly solve the identity of the Zodiac Killer, one of the most infamous serial killers in World History.  The ability to possibly solve the identity of the BC serial killer who is still at large.  It is suspected by the police that there were 3 serial killers involved in BC's missing women.  One suspect has since passed away and Robert Pickton has been incarcerated since he was arrested in 2002 and subsequently sentenced to life in prison, leaving one suspect still at large during a time when women continued to disappear.  My theory presented in my book will show how Henning fits the profile and how more circumstantial evidence could point to him being the worst serial killer in Canadian History.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">At minimum we revive the legend of Zodaic with refreshing new material and a suspect who some around the world have claimed for themself is indeed the Zodiac Killer.  Through the stats feature on my blog I am able to track traffic sources back to various message boards and discussions around the world where some believe that my material is more compelling than any other ever presented..... and I have only presented the tip of the iceberg in the stories on my blog.  There is much more to this amazing story that will be sure to capture the reader from start to finish and create a stir across the entire planet as to whether this man is indeed the Zodiac Killer who continued to evolve and kill North of the Canada/US Border.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Although I have limited ""Consecutive"", writing patterns of this man in my posession, all together I can make up a great portion of the alphabet and number sequencing.  Some experts have advised that I may indeed have enough to at minimum include or exclude the suspect's writing to the Zodiac Killer's writing as well as to the taunting letters left at Vancouver bus stops starting in 1992 describing having sex with children.  This could be critical evidence if proven positive.</span></p>

Prologue

 
This story is about a man who bound, raped and tortured my child for years before she disclosed her abuse to me in April of 1999. My daughter gradually began to reveal more and more details of her abuse including describing extremely graphic and disturbing details of murder. Over time I came to realize that her abuse was NOT about Pedophilia, but about Sadism and a child victim who fulfilled his Sadistic needs in between his kills.
My story documents the charm, cunning and manipulative nature of a psychopath who's organization, skill and evolution has allowed him to get away with his crimes including escaping prosecution for what he did to my child. My story shares the obscure measures that this self proclaimed ""Genius"", took to surround himself with easy prey and to carry out his crimes against them without detection. It would be years before I could gather the strength to resume my fight for justice for my child and begin to piece together this spectacular story that links this deviant to the Zodiac Killer who continued to claim victims in British Columbia, Canada for the past 40 years.

of the worst years of her abuse.  
 
The Story
 
Henning Lagies, the man whom I had met in my foster home at the age of 16 was a good friend of my foster father and was in the home nearly everyday.  I grew to know him over the two years that I had lived there, and after moving out of the foster home Henning would become like a father to me and eventually like a grandfather to my child over the 16 year period of our relationship.  Little did I know that this man was a predator and in hindsight I realized that he strategically placed himself in close proximity of where he could find victims who would be easy to prey on.  The fact that I was a foster child with no family or support systems allowed him to gain my trust and loyalty which he would use to keep me close to him and to eventually gain access to my child after I became a mother.  It was years that I spent time with this man who I also worked with at DND, that allowed him the ability to mould my mind, to take his word as gospel and to trust him more than anyone in the world.  I would never have imagined in my worst nightmares that this man whom I had loved and trusted without any hesitation, would be the man who would cast the ultimate betrayal upon me and my child and would subject my child to sadistic sexual abuse and expose my child to graphic and gory murder scenes.  Whether my child was actually present at these murders, or Henning implanted these acts of violence into her head, this story will share the most astonishing details that will reveal the fantasies of a depraved man whom I absolutely believe is a killer.
I still have audio of some of the murder stories that my child relayed to me and drawings of skinned female genitalia that she claimed she saw her abuser eat.  Henning was supposed to be a vegatarian and he often made a bit of a spectacle in public about being a vegetarian, which I now realize was just part of his act, a common theme that I would later come to realize was his way of creating an illusion as to who he really was.  My child also drew a picture of a ""Machine"", that she saw Henning put bodies into, which accurately portrayed a woodchipper, and she also drew a ""Tool"" that was actually a pair of plyers, that she claims Henning used to pull out a lady's teeth.  I tried to share these details with the RCMP, but the investigating officer wouldn't listen and the charges against Henning were eventually dropped and my child and I were left teetering in the aftermath of this man's crimes without any resolve.  The Vancouver Police Department did get involved regarding my child's murder stories and the Vancouver missing women, and set my child up with a play therapist which they paid for for 9 months.  Although the VPD believed my child was sexually abused they had no jurisdiction and there was never anything tangible for them to go on regarding the murders.  Eventually I began to unravel from the stresss.  My child ended up in foster care and I ended up on disability for several years, but gradually, through counselling, I was able to start digging myself out of the dark place that I had lived for so many years.
In 2007 I recognized the handwriting from Robert Graysmith's movie ""Zodiac"", as being the exact same style as Henning's writing.  I hadn't really known much about Zodiac at the time, other than it was a story we talked about as kids about some guy killing couples and the fact that he was never caught.  It wasn't until watching the movie in 2007 that I connected the strange coincidence about the handwriting appearing to match a man whom I had now believed was a killer since my daughter's disclosures of her sadistic abuse and depictions of murder in 1999.  I did a little research and I pulled what samples of Henning's handwriting I had to compare with Zodiac letters that I found on the internet, and I was amazed to see how closely Henning's writing resembled Zodiac's.  Not only that, but after reading numerous letters that were written by Zodiac, I was struck by the fact that Zodiac's linguistics also appeared to link Henning to being the Zodiac Killer.  Two things that really stood out for me was how Zodiac always used the word ""Shall"", as did Henning, and how Zodiac wrote in a letter to the editor ""Happy Christmass"", amongst a multitude of other phrasing and idealisms.  One year Henning had given me a card that said ""Happy Christmass"", spelled just like that.  When I told him that is now how you spell Christmas, he just shrugged.  Now here is a man with genius IQ and he doesn't know how to spell Christmas?  Not likely, but at the time I didn't know much about Zodiac so I never made the connection.  There would be much more that I would later discover, but not until years later when I accidentally stumbled across more details that possibly linked Henning to being the Zodiac Killer, as well as the BC Serial Killer who had been claiming victims in British Columbia for 40 years since Zodiac went out of site in the United States.
In January of 2010  I began conducting research on our missing women from the Vancouver, Eastside as well as along Highway 16 now dubbed the ""Highway of Tears"", trying to find clues as to the murder stories that my child had relayed to me.  It was then that I accidentally stumbled across more details that points the suspect in the BC killings as possibly being the Zodiac Killer, simply killing equal distances North and South of the Canada/US Border and also in areas on both sides of the border where he had family living.  My research shows timelines that match to Zodiac as well as when killings began in BC and times the suspect had opportunity to kill and was in the vincinity of women who vanished in BC amongst a multitude of other circumstantial evidence.  Much of this information is documented on my blog, but there is much more than I could ever say in a blog and it will all be revealed in my book.
  
Although the RCMP dismissed what happend to my child, subsequent reports from Children's Hospital would support that she was sexually abused.   The reports also show that her depictions of murder, cannibalism and exposure to extreme violence were documented and were not diagnosed as manipulation, or psychosis.

Zodiac Killer
 
In the sections below there are references taken from three separate sites on the internet that discuss ""Zodiac's Profile"", the profile of an ""Organized Serial Killer"", and ""What Makes a Psychopath?""  Many have questioned my theory on Henning being the Zodiac Killer, because they don't feel that the BC killings match the Zodiac Killings.  My book will reveal how Henning matches most of the traits described in the various sections below, how serial killers evolve, and how psychopaths can and do change victim type including changing from children to adults and vice versa.  When the data from the expert Forensic community is parallelled with characteristics of Henning and the many erie details of his existance, it will become clear how this man does indeed fit the profile of the Zodiac Killer who evolved into the BC Serial Killer and a Cannibal.

Zodiac Killer Profile
By Gregg McCrary
http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/zodiac_profile/5.html

 
The killer constantly changed his method of operating and openly admitted that murder was sport for him. The attacks occurred at dusk or after dark, on weekends, often around holidays, with different weapons and apparently with no motive save violence itself. Clearly, the killer wanted credit for them and he turned most of his rage against females.
Possible motives were to prove his superiority, get attention, control the investigation, create a terroristic climate, and relive the crimes via media reports. Going after couples, which he did three times, could indicate that he was envious or jealous because he did not (or could not) have that kind of relationship. It might also have been to show that he was not afraid to confront a male, although the fact that he targeted three couples when he could have only shot lone females or lone males indicates resentment about relationships.
He liked to ambush his victims, yet for him none of these incidents were high risk crimes. While they were out in the open, they were not risky. Even when he set himself up for a potential risk, by being interviewed by phone, for example, he usually withdrew. Yet it's possible that he believed he was taking a risk, so he could congratulate himself when he did not get caught. Maybe he viewed these crimes as proof of his skill in stealth. He might have fantasized about himself being more daring than he actually was. By all witness accounts, he appeared to be late twenties to early thirties, heavyset, strong, and aggressive. It wouldn't be surprising that his fantasies of being a skilled ""hunter"" grew from an immature and insecure mind.
Nevertheless, the man who called himself the Zodiac was organized, intelligent and meticulous. If we take the reference to the Zodiac seriously, we find several symbols in his initial cryptogram that look like the symbol for Taurus the bull, which could identify his approximate birth date. He obviously liked astrology and might have viewed himself as fated by the stars. Those close to him would probably have heard him engage in knowledgeable discussions about astrological symbols and meanings.
Among the most engaging aspects of the crimes for him was to be able to taunt the authorities from a superior perspective and to watch the police make fools of themselves. This often indicates a person who feels uncertain about his intelligence, so to reassure himself, he plays games with others. The Zodiac needed to think he was smarter than even the best detectives, and he probably exaggerated the risks he took in order to affirm his smug sense of superiority. People who knew him would have been familiar with his arrogance, as well as his shortcomings and insecurity.
He used a lot of diversionary tactics, such as making threats that turned out not to be true, or posing cryptic mysteries. This is a form of what's called ""duping delight."" He's excited by duping others. The puzzles he presented probably meant nothing, but this man enjoyed knowing that a whole city full of people, as well as a number of law enforcement agencies, were at work on whatever code or clue he sent. That would have given him a thrill, knowing that the resolutions were merely dead-ends, and yet people would keep trying to find out what they meant. The closer they thought they were to identifying him, the more it would have amused him.
He enjoyed the control he exerted because he was in charge; he was running the investigation, more or less, as though he was the supervisor. He might have had pretensions of being a police officer, but for some reason been barred from this profession. This way, with these threats, he got to order them about. When he moved from the Vallejo area into San Francisco for his murders, he acquired a greater venue for control, along with the ability to spread the terror and feel more powerful. For him, it was all about that. He exerted control over his victims, and he did the same with anyone who was concerned about becoming a random victim.
He especially enjoyed controlling the newspapers and the police agencies of a town the size of San Francisco. He liked knowing they got into tiffs over territory and investigative squabbles. To his mind, that was more evidence of how stupid they were, and each day that went by without them catching him reinforced this opinion and sense of superiority. Every communication he sent fueled that fire.
 

Organized Homicide

http://psychautopsy.weebly.com/organized-vs-disorganized.html

Organized offenders are psychopathic and antisocial, irrational but sane. They are indifferent to fellow humans, irresponsible, and self-centered. They are manipulative, deliberative, and full of guile but outwardly amiable as long as it suits his objective. In other words, this type of offender could truly be a pillar of the community, the patron saint of child or spousal abuse prevention, and the neighborhood's most willing handyman. All the while, he is also the bogeyman who stalks his community's women, tortures them, and snuffs out their last breath. He is equally convincing in both roles and this is why the news reports always show the community astonishment in phrases like, ""He was always such a nice guy."" They are cunning and emotionless, which is how they can play both sides of the coin. When you have nothing emotional to invest in anyone, giving everyone exactly what they want takes nothing from you, but it can give you an advantage when you are trying to keep people from suspecting you are a compulsive murderer. This offender is extroverted, articulate, and highly narcissistic. He takes great care with his physical health and appearance. He will dress himself neatly whether in business or casual attire.There will always be a specific stressor in the offender's life that precipitates the beginning of his murderous career. These can be related to finances, employment, a marriage, or any close relationship. While there are events that will trigger the leap to murder, the fantasy is what fuels and builds up the desire to commit the crime. Offenders of this type will spend years, a decade or more, constructing their fantasy world. They use their crimes to hone these fantasies and improve upon them in order to heighten their level of self-gratification.This offender will perpetrate very deliberative crimes, thoroughly calculated and planned. Premeditation of these crimes will also typically include extensive stalking. He preys mostly on strangers so that he cannot be linked to their victims in any way. He will hunt far from work or home, but in an area he has surveilled and become intimately familiar with. The abduction and abuse of the victim will be perpetrated with as much precision and calculation as the predator has put into planning his clear escape. An organized sexual homicide will have multiple scenes: the location of initial contact or assault, the scene of death, and the body disposal site. This offender is socially adept and may con or persuade his victims into going with him willingly. He may pose as an authority figure, using a uniform that will disarm his victims such as that of a police officer. Victimology for an organized sexual homicide suggests a female or adolescent male. The victim will be single, employed, and live alone. The offender's risk for this type of crime is higher if committed outdoors or during the day. The victim of this crime is not known to the offender, but is chosen because she meets criteria specific to the killer's psychological construct. In multiple, linked homicides, the similarities in appearance of the victims will be obvious. For example, all of Ted Bundy's victims (except the last one) looked just like his ex-fiancee.This offender plans his murders, spends time targeting his victims, and displays control over the scene. He is methodical and orderly throughout all phases of the crime. The murders themselves are slow and sadistic for an experienced killer who is comfortable with his level of control over all factors. This type of offender is so in control of his surroundings that he can adapt to obstacles that occur during the commission of the crime in an outwardly calm manner. For example, the Zodiac killer was able to provide a dummy description of a dummy suspect when he came face to face with the police who were looking for him minutes after he'd shot a cab driver. Ed Kemper drove through a security gate at a college campus with two dying women in the car without raising any suspicion from the guards. These predators engage in staging to aid them in evading detection. The scene may be altered to appear careless or disorganized on purpose as a way to throw off the investigation. Secondary criminal activity may be staged to disguise the sexual homicide as some other type of murder.He takes care not to leave fingerprints, semen, or spent cartridges and shells. They make an effort to erase all prints and other potential evidence. Sometimes these perpetrators will scrub the victim down with bleach, along with the bathroom and kitchen, to destroy any trace he may have left. Some have been known to go to the extreme of removing all of their body hair and mutilating the tips of their fingers to avoid mishaps or carelessness at the scene. Weapons are brought to the scene by the perpetrator and leave the scene with him. He will have a ""kit"" consisting of various items like tape, chains, ropes, or chemicals. Restraints reflect a methodical approach, providing order for the perpetrator prior to, during, and after the crime. The scene will appear controlled and planned out. All finger- and footprints will be removed. Regardless of the ridiculous notions spouted off on television or in movies, these predators DO NOT want to be caught. EVER. They put so much effort into assuring they will outsmart the police because they all want to follow in the footsteps of Zodiac and Saucy Jack.This offender takes trophies to commemorate the success of his endeavor. They also serve as proof of his skill and control. These items will be used to help the perpetrator relive the fantasy he has acted out. He will conceal or dispose of the body in a location that is familiar to him, but not connected to the area where he lives or works. He will return to surveill the scenes and may inject himself into the investigation by being overly cooperative with law enforcement. Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, returned to the dump sites to have sex with the bodies of his victims over and over, until maggots invaded the body. This behavior serves a dual purpose: it keeps him apprised of the progress of the investigation while affording him the opportunity to relive the crime where it happened.

What Makes a Psychopath?
 
Excerpts from a discussion by Canadian Forensic Psychologist, Dr. Stephen Porter, UBC.
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/conditions/addiction/mental-health/what-makes-a-psychopath/article1770811/
  
Comment From GuestGuest: ] how long have you been studying psychopaths, and has your views changed since you first began your study. 
Dr. Stephen Porter: 
I started studying psychopaths when I was working in a federal prison for my internship about twelve years ago. I thought I was having success providing weekly therapy to a psychopathic pedophile. However, his diary got confiscated after eleven months of therapy, and it turned out his fantasies were getting more and more sadistic and he wrote that he planned to murder children upon release. Not exactly a therapy success story! I started to research both the violent behaviour of psychopaths and their incredible ability to deceive and manipulate others. My views have changed over that time in the sense that I now believe that psychopaths are extremely rational and know the difference between right and wrong. Earlier, I felt that psychopaths were impulsive and that somehow their bizarre behaviour was beyond their choice. Our research has challenged that idea. 
Comment From FredFred: ] What signs would you expect to see from a close contact which may indicate pschopathic tendencies? 
 Dr. Stephen Porter: 
I'm not sure if by ""close contact"" you mean a family member or acquaintance/work colleague. But either way, typically the person will come across as highly likeable and charming, even charismatic. However, this charm is superficial in the sense that it is all part of an acting job, intended to manipulate the other person. In other words, the individual's behaviour will ultimately contradict the friendly, charming mask. You will see a pattern of persistent lying and deception (from a young age) including false promises, a ""gift of gab"", callous behaviour, including taking advantage of and conning others, a sense of superiority, stepping on others to get ahead, promiscuous sexual behaviour, and an inability to form anything more than superficial bonds with friends or partners. Often, such individuals are described in a Jekyll and Hyde way, such as ""he was so likeable and friendly, a real class clown but then I got involved with him and found out the truth too late."" 
Comment From Elizabeth: ] As psychopaths know right from wrong, what causes them to commit violent crimes, and what justifications do they give for their behaviour?  
Dr. Stephen Porter: 
Great question and one we have been researching for some time. Psychopaths in my view do know right from wrong in the ""cognitive"" or rational sense, and even do as well on moral-reasoning tasks in the lab setting as the rest of us. A better question might be why don't most people NOT act on their immoral or even violent impulses. All humans have sexual, violent, and antisocial thoughts and impulses that they choose not to act upon because of our ""conscience"". We have empathy for others and we know we could not live with ourselves if we acted on the dark thought. Psychopaths don't have to worry about a conscience to stop them from doing violent crimes. Research suggests that some of their main motivations include calculated revenge, thrill-seeking and sex, pure greed, and do intimidate and gain power. Many of the violent psychopaths we have studied were inspired purely by getting a thrill. For example, our research shows that the vast majority of sex offenders who cross the line from children to adults or vice versa are psychopaths. When asked about this pattern, one fellow I assessed told me he simply got bored with one victim type and then would move to another type. 
 
Geography
 
In my theory I hypothesise how if Henning is the Zodiac Killer that he did not live in the San Francisco area, but traveled from the Vancouver, BC area to San Francisco where he had family.  My theory is that should Henning be the Zodiac Killer, that this was his beginning as a killer.  I would suspect that earlier murders such as Cheri Jo Bates was indeed Henning and I have documented some circumstantial evidence pointing Henning to being her killer as well.  I believe that Henning would have gone through great lengths in order to go undetected, thus traveling the approximate 1,000 miles from Vancouver, BC to San Francisco which allowed him to test the waters in an area where nobody would ever suspect that he would be the killer, and he did so in an area where he would have an alibi by saying he was in town to visit with his family should anyone have seen him.  If we look at the location of the killings in British Columbia, we will see this same pattern of a killer who travelled approximately 1,000 miles along Highways 5, 16 and 97 which is now known as the ""Highway of Tears"", and has been the location of where dozens of women have disappeared or been found murdered over the past 40 years.  The other parallel linking Zodiac to the BC Serial Killer shows how many of the BC killings again took place in an area where Henning had family living in the 108 Mile Ranch area along the Cariboo Highway (Hwy. 97).  Eerily the approximate location of the home Henning co-owned with his father there (secondary to his Vancouver residence), resembles the location of the Lake Herman Killings near San Francisco, California.
 
Map that shows distances that killings took place on both sides of the Canada/US border in both the Zodiac and BC murders.  The suspect Henning Lagies lives right in the middle of these killing grounds.

 
Map that documents the distance from San Francisco, CA to Vancouver, BC shows that the drive is possible and could account for why the Zodiac murders took place on weekends when it was possible for Henning to drive to and from San Francisco during  these time periods.

 
Map that documents the distance from the Vancouver, BC area to Prince Rupert, BC where killings and disappearances have taken place along this entire stretch of highway over a 40 year period.  This shows how the BC serial killer traveled approximately the same distance up Highway of Tears in British Columbia to kill, as the suspect Henning Lagies may have traveled to San Francisco in the Zodiac Killings.

 
Another coincidence is that Henning lives only 2.6 miles from the Pickton Pig Farm where Robert Pickton tortured and murdered women. It is thought that Pickton had an accomplice.... coincidental or linked? Regardless, Pickton proves that this type of crime does happen and the RCMP should have taken seriously the crimes committed against my child and the possibility that this man is a viable suspect re our missing women. I have repeatedly tried to notify the RCMP, media and missing persons organizations over the past two years about this man in regards to what he did to my child and the fact that he is a dangerous man who should be considered a suspect in the BC killings..... media and others are interested until they actually relay my story to the RCMP who obviously do all they can to downplay my story. Typical of what happend in the Robert Pickton case.
 
Location of suspect's residence in Port Coquitlam, BC (Greater Vancouver area)

 
The DNA of 33 women was found on Robert Picton's farm, but dozens of women are still unaccounted for.

 
Another home that Henning co-owned with his father in 108 Mile Ranch along a section of the Cariboo Highway now dubbed ""The Highway of Tears"".  Henning co-owned the home sometime from the early to mid 70's and took over ownership in the mid 90's.  Map shows how bodies began to circle an area around his home during that time.

 

The Impact
The ability to bring awareness to this story and the abundance of circumstantial evidence that points Henning to being the Zodiac Killer as well as the BC Serial Killer who has been claiming victims in British Columbia, Canada for the past 40 years.  This awareness could in turn warrant investigation through the US and Canadian authorities which may result in the prosecution of the offender.
The ability to possibly solve the identity of the Zodiac Killer, one of the most infamous serial killers in World History.  The ability to possibly solve the identity of the BC serial killer who is still at large.  It is suspected by the police that there were 3 serial killers involved in BC's missing women.  One suspect has since passed away and Robert Pickton has been incarcerated since he was arrested in 2002 and subsequently sentenced to life in prison, leaving one suspect still at large during a time when women continued to disappear.  My theory presented in my book will show how Henning fits the profile and how more circumstantial evidence could point to him being the worst serial killer in Canadian History.
At minimum we revive the legend of Zodaic with refreshing new material and a suspect who some around the world have claimed for themself is indeed the Zodiac Killer.  Through the stats feature on my blog I am able to track traffic sources back to various message boards and discussions around the world where some believe that my material is more compelling than any other ever presented..... and I have only presented the tip of the iceberg in the stories on my blog.  There is much more to this amazing story that will be sure to capture the reader from start to finish and create a stir across the entire planet as to whether this man is indeed the Zodiac Killer who continued to evolve and kill North of the Canada/US Border.

UPDATE: Ron Rice, Forensic Examiner Donates Services
 
Although I have limited ""Consecutive"", writing patterns of this man in my posession, all together I can make up a great portion of the alphabet and number sequencing.  Some experts have advised that I may indeed have enough to at minimum include or exclude the suspect's writing to the Zodiac Killer's writing as well as to the taunting letters left at Vancouver bus stops starting in 1992 describing having sex with children.  This could be critical evidence if proven positive.
 

 
Top word ""Consternation"", written by Zodiac in taunting letter.  Below are individual letters belonging to Henning's writing (with the exception of the c), brought together to create the same word, which has strong resemblance to Zodiac's writing.

  
 
Copy of ""Bus Stop"", letter written in 1992, but not published by police until 2005.
There were apparently a number of these letters left at bus stops over the years.

""Zodiac Killer North"", Book Funding - $3,000 
 
BC's long and winding highways (and logging roads), along dense forests create many vanishing points.

 
Whether the man who abused my child is or is not the Zodiac Killer, I absolutely believe with every fiber of my being that he is a killer here in British Columbia, Canada responsible for dozens if not into the hundreds of missing women over the past 40 years.  The compelling circumstantial evidence that points this man to being the Zodiac Killer may be only coincidental, however it is strong enough for me name the BC Killer in perhpas only a metaphorical sense, ""Zodiac Killer North"", whilst leaving speculation open as to whether Zodiac simply continued his killing spree just North of the Canada/US border.  There is much more circumstantial evidence to be presented in my book than is posted on my blog.
I require $3,000 to complete my book.  These funds are allocated to completing, formating and editing the manuscript as well as covering any associated fees for mailing hard copies of manuscripts to agents and publishers for review.  I am personally donating 100% of my time into continued research, documentation, completion of draft material, public awareness and pre-marketing so that when the manuscript is finished I am fully prepared to seek publishing with an audience already in place.

In addition to writing the book I have plans to start ""Zodiac North"", an interactive crime e-magazine.  The magazine will contain additional stories and images regarding my story, other crime articles, crime prevention strategies, and invite the reader to participate, thus helping to develop the content and discussions.
 
I require $2000 for website development, SEO and technical training so that I can maintain my own website for producing new issues and continue with SEO.

<p>Shortly after the centennial of Garibaldi’s conquest, a Hollywood film crew invades Palermo to shoot an epic about the Italian Revolution. Researching the past, the director visits the Capuchin Monastery, whose catacombs contain over eight thousand mummies. Preserved among these is Marchesa Spinelli, dead for eighty years but still haunted by memories. Posthumously, she recalls her complicated relationships with Don Alfonso, her scientist father; Benjamin Ingham, a British wine merchant and an honorary Sicilian baron, whom the Marchesa failed to marry; Regina, her patriotic and rebellious granddaughter, who idolizes Verdi and Garibaldi; and Giacomo Leopardi, the doomed Romantic poet.</p>
<p>Drawing on history and family legend, <em>Trinàcria</em> presents a tale of progress and reaction, irony and paradox, in which the splendors of Caserta must yield to the wonders of the Crystal Palace. Both intimate and sweeping, this work questions the price of pride and the cost of prosperity and contrasts illusions of grandeur and happiness with the pitiless truth that kills all hope and desire. As readers will learn, this is the fatal spell of Sicily—an island of loss and change—where death alone is eternal.</p>

<p><em>Read what critics have to say about <strong>Trinàcria</strong>:</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em></em><em></em><em></em>“History,” T. S. Eliot observed, “has many cunning passages, contrived corridors.” Anthony Di Renzo’s novella <em>Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily</em> demonstrates how cunningly we all contrive to find in history only the lessons we want to. The book’s narrator, to our initial surprise, is the mummified corpse of Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, Marchesa of Scalea (1794-1882), who had adopted the <em>nom de plume </em>of Trinàcria, an ancient name for Sicily. But soon the voice of this long-dead wit and <em>salonnière</em>—arrogant, erudite, and vengeful—grows as familiar to us as the thousand little lies we tell ourselves each day. <br/></p></span><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Donna Zita represents Di Renzo’s spirited rejoinder to Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s classic novel <em>Il Gattopardo </em>(<em>The Leopard</em>), a nostalgic portrayal of old aristocratic Sicily and its privileged world, swept away by Garibaldi’s conquest. Less objective than Lampedusa’s Prince Fabrizio Corbera, Marchesa Spinelli blames the commercial and materialistic forces unleashed by Sicily’s unification with the new kingdom of Italy for ushering in a vapid culture in which the presiding deity is money. But more “things” will never make people better: “We aristocrats have plenty of things,” Donna Zita remarks, “and we are proud and vicious.”</p>
<p>Di Renzo’s writing is vivid and brimful of sardonic humor. He specializes in crisp evocations of outdoor scenes, such as the bustling streets of Naples or the unforgettably cruel festival of the <em>Cuccagna</em>; but the main attraction is the marchesa herself, a force of nature as powerful and inexorable as the Sicilian sun in July.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">~Peter D'Epiro and Mary Desmond Pinkowish, authors of <em>Sprezzatura: 50 Ways Italian Genius Shaped the World</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Medal and Ribbon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.coins-la-galerie-numismatique.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_full/products/630.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Constantinian Order of St. George""/>“The past never dies,” says Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, Marchesa of Scalea, the narrator and protagonist of <em>Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily</em>. Neither does the eternal appeal of Sicily. The Italian American writer Anthony Di Renzo has breathed new life into the glorious tradition of the Sicilian historical novel.</p>
<p>This fascinating book dialogues with literature, cinema, and the figurative arts. Di Renzo not only evokes the history of the Bourbons and the Risorgimento but also captures Sicily’s aura as a “paper island,” an imaginative world created by Italy’s most important modern writers. His novel will remind readers of De Roberto's <em>The Viceroys</em> and Tomasi di Lampedusa’s <em>The Leopard</em>, two different and perhaps even opposite works. The first seems to have inspired Di Renzo’s love for the surreal and grotesque, the second his lyricism and elegiac melancholy.</p>
<p>Donna Zita is a fascinating character. She is romantic and enlightened, rebellious and ambitious, beautiful and mysterious. Her nickname Trinacrìa, one of Sicily’s most ancient names, shows her complete identification with this paradoxical island: wild but cultured, timeless but ephemeral, sparkling but bleak. For Zita, as for Sicily, the present is transient, while the past is eternal. Sicily here is simultaneously myth and reality. While the novel’s historical data is accurate and authentic, this book appeals to the eye more than the mind. From the opening scene in which a Hollywood crew prepares to shoot an epic about Garibaldi's Thousand in Palermo, the reader is carried away by a montage of beautiful images. Through sheer witchcraft, Anthony Di Renzo recreates the timeless spell of the Medusa.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>~</em>Margherita Ganeri, author of <em><em>The Italian Historical Novel</em><br/></em></p>
<p><img alt=""Order of San Genarro"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mcsearch.info/images/8_m/71428.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Order of San Genarro""/>Anthony Di Renzo’s <em>Trinàcria</em> peels away layers of 19th-century Sicilian history in a way that academic and popular studies of this period cannot. The novel provides an intimate perspective on sweeping public events. Di Renzo tells the story of Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, Marchesa of Scalea, who is a composite of two historical figures:  Antonia Vassallo, Princess of Bellaprima, and Alessandra Spadafora, Duchess of Santa Rosalia. During her long life, Donna Zita meets kings and queens, great composers, poets, and foreign entrepreneurs seeking to make their fortunes off her island's bounty.  Di Renzo’s sardonic depiction of the Marchesa's deeply felt cynicism often kicks the modern reader in the gut: the brutality of husbands toward wives; the cruelty of fathers toward children; the impact of a woman's revenge and of her unyielding, unforgiving pride; above all, the lost promise of Italy's Unification to Sicilians This finely crafted novel glitters with polished metaphors and sparking epigrams. It is a marvelous work in the tradition of Dacia Maraini's <em>The Silent Duchess</em>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">~John Keahey, author of <em>Seeking Sicily</em></p>
<p>A triumph of wit and eloquence, Anthony Di Renzo’s <em>Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily</em> displays a thorough knowledge of Italian culture, weaving fascinating historical material with astute commentaries about Italian life, ancient and modern. Di Renzo creates unforgettable scenes sometimes operatic in their intensity.  His confident, beguiling style will remind readers of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s in <em>The Leopard </em>and of Salman Rushdie’s at his very best.  Like these authors, Di Renzo adroitly dips in and out of magical realism, but never lets technique interfere with fast plotting and vivid characterization.  The novel’s brilliant, bedraggled narrator, the Marchesa of Scalea (nicknamed Trinàcria, after the three-legged symbol of Sicily), is always lively, even when speaking from her tomb, full of wisdom, caustic humor and eccentric charm.  Her tragicomic story makes <em>Trinàcria</em> an enormously satisfying historical novel.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">~Edward Hower, author of <em>The New Life Hotel</em> and <em>Storms of May</em></p>
<p>What a great read this novel is, better than a trip to Sicily!  Full of shock and delight, <em>Trinàcria</em> forms a fascinating epic about Bourbon Palermo on the eve of disaster.  In the book's title character, the Marchesa of Scalea, Anthony Di Renzo creates a woman who demonstrates the folly and passion of living life defiantly on the brink.  Few writers are better at showing the intimate, sometimes comic connections between the past and the present, between the old world and the new. If you love drama and discovery, you will enjoy <em>Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily</em>.</p>

<p><em><img alt=""Medals and Sash"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.borbone-due-sicilie.org/images/stferdinand_merit_gc_badge.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Order of St. Ferdinand""/>Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily</em> is a completely original look at a long-maligned and misunderstood island—a part of and yet always apart from the modern political construct of Italy. In a work rich with history, Anthony Di Renzo takes the reader into Sicily’s pre-unification past by having the mummified dead of Palermo’s Capuchin catacombs confront a film crew from Italy’s <em>dolce vita</em> era. This fascinating metaphysical and psychological landscape is replete with Redshirts, petty nobility, studio hacks, and two centuries of bitter Sicilian wisdom. ""We all have skeletons in the closet,"" says the Marchesa of Scalea, the novel’s narrator and protagonist. “If they must rattle, they may as well dance.” And dance they do in a macabre but spirited tarantella.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">~Paul Paolicelli, author of <em>Dances with Luigi</em> and <em>Under the Southern Sun</em></p>
<p>Most historical fiction paints the past in flattering oils. <em>Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily</em> is etched in acid. Goya could have created this novel’s caustic characters, particularly its protagonist and narrator, Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, the baleful Marchesa of Scalea, whose crest is modeled after the three-legged gorgon of Sicily. Donna Zita recounts her life from a crypt in Palermo’s Capuchin Catacombs. Outrage over lost privilege has given her a posthumous case of acid reflux. But as the Marchesa relives past violations—her land scorched to dust by the pitiless Sicilian sun; her carriage hacked to pieces by Garibaldi’s Red Shits; her crest and <em>nom de plume</em> Trinàcria, the ancient name of Sicily, turned into a label for cheap, mass-produced vinegar—readers learn to sympathize with this spiteful banshee.</p>
<p>Anthony Di Renzo’s masterful, richly textured and layered narrative never hesitates to challenge its own discourse of storytelling, to question the ways craft transforms history into fiction.  But it also poses an ethical challenge. Like the Marchesa, the author confronts our complacency and demands that we examine our own vanities, political hubris, and fragility. Will we take responsibility for our individual and collective histories or float into oblivion, thinking life was all a trick? This spellbinding narrative leaves us with no answers, only the lingering scent of broom.</p>

""The past never dies."" Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, Marchesa of Scalea (1794-1882)
HISTORY is full of ghosts, particularly in Sicily where the truth is often buried alive. This book campaign, organized by Guernica Editions and sponsored by the Italian Cultural Foundation at Casa Belvedere, exhumes a forgotten heritage and challenges official narratives about the past.
Before reading further, however, watch:

""Trinàcria: The Past Never Dies.""

This video will introduce you to our author and his characters, while the sections below will background our campaign and detail fundraising.
The photograph on the right, Marco Lanza's La Cripta dei Cappuccini, is available as a poster. For other donation gifts, browse our gallery catalog.
 
Background
Guernica Editions, an independent press based in Toronto, Ontario, wishes to publish Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily. Like Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s The Leopard, Federico De Roberto’s The Viceroys, and Susan Sontag’s The Volcano Lover, this historical novel deals with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the decades leading up to the Italian Revolution.
Dedicated to promoting new works of global literature and shattering old stereotypes, Guernica considers Trinàcria “a timely book.” Last year’s Sesquicentennial of the Risorgimento stirred controversy in Italy and abroad. Did unification benefit or ruin the Mezzogiorno, the ancestral region of most Italian immigrants?
Publishing Trinàcria, Guernica believes, ""could contribute significantly"" to the ongoing reassessment of the Italian Revolution on both sides of the Atlantic. By implication, however, the book also examines the limitations of modern commercial democracies and warns about the dangers of nation-building in the developing world.
 
Fundraising
Because Guernica’s government funding does not extend to non-Canadian authors, the Italian Cultural Foundation at Casa Belvedere is sponsoring this fundraiser. Such patronage reflects Casa Belvedere's ongoing mission ""to preserve and promote an appreciation of Italian language, arts, literature, history, fashion, cuisine, and commerce.""   
This campaign intends to raise a minimum of $5,000 between now and December 13. This sum will cover the book's editing, design, production, and distribution. Donations made after we meet this goal will pay for campaign costs, such as printing, postage, promotional expenses, and online site fees. Either way, your money will be put to good use.
Contributors can rely on the sterling reputation of our fundraising consultant Roberto Ragone. With help from Debra Santagelo, president of Sicilian Connections, he brought together Casa Belvedere and Guernica Editions on this international literary project.
Roberto's motto is: ""Transforming Vision to Value."" As former executive director of the New York’s Lower East Side Business Improvement District, Roberto served as marketing director for the Ciao America Film Project and president and publicist for FIERI International, an organization of college students and young professionals interested in celebrating and promoting Italian culture. To learn more about Roberto and his background, review his LinkedIn profile at:

Synopsis of Novel
Set in 18th- and 19th-century Palermo, Naples, and London, Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily revolves around the Marchesa of Scalea, Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, notorious beauty, ferocious wit, secret murderer, and reluctant businesswoman, whose turbulent life mirrors her world’s rocky transition from feudalism to capitalism.
Shortly after the centennial of Garibaldi’s conquest, a Hollywood film crew invades Palermo to shoot an epic about the Italian Revolution. Researching the past, the director visits the Capuchin Monastery, whose catacombs contain over eight thousand mummies. Preserved among these is Marchesa Spinelli, dead for eighty years but still haunted by memories. Posthumously, she recalls her complicated relationships with Don Alfonso, her scientist father; Benjamin Ingham, a British wine merchant and an honorary Sicilian baron, whom the Marchesa failed to marry; Regina, her patriotic and rebellious granddaughter, who idolizes Verdi and Garibaldi; and Giacomo Leopardi, the doomed Romantic poet.
Drawing on history and family legend, Trinàcria presents a tale of progress and reaction, irony and paradox, in which the splendors of Caserta must yield to the wonders of the Crystal Palace. Both intimate and sweeping, this work questions the price of pride and the cost of prosperity and contrasts illusions of grandeur and happiness with the pitiless truth that kills all hope and desire. As readers will learn, this is the fatal spell of Sicily—an island of loss and change—where death alone is eternal.
 
A Taste of Trinàcria

Sicilian pastry expresses the island's Baroque imagination. For generations, master bakers have molded fruit out of marzipan and knights out of sugar. This tradition continues at Villabate-Alba Pasticceria and Bakery in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
The Alaimo family, whose ancestral town of Villabate is the novel's main setting, still make traditional cannoli and cassata. During November, the Month of the Dead, however, they also bake ossi di morti, almond cookies resembling human bones.
In the same spirit, Guernica Editions serves you ""Eternal Death."" Orginally published in Feile-Festa; The Literary Arts Journal of the Mediterranean Celtic Cultural Association, this excerpt from Trinàcria introduces the ghost of the Marchesa of Scalea. ""The Latest Invasion,"" the book's prologue, is posted in our gallery. A $25 donation buys a PDF of the entire novel.
 

Advanced Praise 

Read what critics have to say about Trinàcria:

“History,” T. S. Eliot observed, “has many cunning passages, contrived corridors.” Anthony Di Renzo’s novella Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily demonstrates how cunningly we all contrive to find in history only the lessons we want to. The book’s narrator, to our initial surprise, is the mummified corpse of Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, Marchesa of Scalea (1794-1882), who had adopted the nom de plume of Trinàcria, an ancient name for Sicily. But soon the voice of this long-dead wit and salonnière—arrogant, erudite, and vengeful—grows as familiar to us as the thousand little lies we tell ourselves each day. Donna Zita represents Di Renzo’s spirited rejoinder to Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s classic novel Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), a nostalgic portrayal of old aristocratic Sicily and its privileged world, swept away by Garibaldi’s conquest. Less objective than Lampedusa’s Prince Fabrizio Corbera, Marchesa Spinelli blames the commercial and materialistic forces unleashed by Sicily’s unification with the new kingdom of Italy for ushering in a vapid culture in which the presiding deity is money. But more “things” will never make people better: “We aristocrats have plenty of things,” Donna Zita remarks, “and we are proud and vicious.”
Di Renzo’s writing is vivid and brimful of sardonic humor. He specializes in crisp evocations of outdoor scenes, such as the bustling streets of Naples or the unforgettably cruel festival of the Cuccagna; but the main attraction is the marchesa herself, a force of nature as powerful and inexorable as the Sicilian sun in July.
~Peter D'Epiro and Mary Desmond Pinkowish, authors of Sprezzatura: 50 Ways Italian Genius Shaped the World
“The past never dies,” says Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, Marchesa of Scalea, the narrator and protagonist of Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily. Neither does the eternal appeal of Sicily. The Italian American writer Anthony Di Renzo has breathed new life into the glorious tradition of the Sicilian historical novel.
This fascinating book dialogues with literature, cinema, and the figurative arts. Di Renzo not only evokes the history of the Bourbons and the Risorgimento but also captures Sicily’s aura as a “paper island,” an imaginative world created by Italy’s most important modern writers. His novel will remind readers of De Roberto's The Viceroys and Tomasi di Lampedusa’s The Leopard, two different and perhaps even opposite works. The first seems to have inspired Di Renzo’s love for the surreal and grotesque, the second his lyricism and elegiac melancholy.
Donna Zita is a fascinating character. She is romantic and enlightened, rebellious and ambitious, beautiful and mysterious. Her nickname Trinacrìa, one of Sicily’s most ancient names, shows her complete identification with this paradoxical island: wild but cultured, timeless but ephemeral, sparkling but bleak. For Zita, as for Sicily, the present is transient, while the past is eternal. Sicily here is simultaneously myth and reality. While the novel’s historical data is accurate and authentic, this book appeals to the eye more than the mind. From the opening scene in which a Hollywood crew prepares to shoot an epic about Garibaldi's Thousand in Palermo, the reader is carried away by a montage of beautiful images. Through sheer witchcraft, Anthony Di Renzo recreates the timeless spell of the Medusa.
~Margherita Ganeri, author of The Italian Historical Novel
Anthony Di Renzo’s Trinàcria peels away layers of 19th-century Sicilian history in a way that academic and popular studies of this period cannot. The novel provides an intimate perspective on sweeping public events. Di Renzo tells the story of Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, Marchesa of Scalea, who is a composite of two historical figures:  Antonia Vassallo, Princess of Bellaprima, and Alessandra Spadafora, Duchess of Santa Rosalia. During her long life, Donna Zita meets kings and queens, great composers, poets, and foreign entrepreneurs seeking to make their fortunes off her island's bounty.  Di Renzo’s sardonic depiction of the Marchesa's deeply felt cynicism often kicks the modern reader in the gut: the brutality of husbands toward wives; the cruelty of fathers toward children; the impact of a woman's revenge and of her unyielding, unforgiving pride; above all, the lost promise of Italy's Unification to Sicilians This finely crafted novel glitters with polished metaphors and sparking epigrams. It is a marvelous work in the tradition of Dacia Maraini's The Silent Duchess.
~John Keahey, author of Seeking Sicily
A triumph of wit and eloquence, Anthony Di Renzo’s Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily displays a thorough knowledge of Italian culture, weaving fascinating historical material with astute commentaries about Italian life, ancient and modern. Di Renzo creates unforgettable scenes sometimes operatic in their intensity.  His confident, beguiling style will remind readers of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s in The Leopard and of Salman Rushdie’s at his very best.  Like these authors, Di Renzo adroitly dips in and out of magical realism, but never lets technique interfere with fast plotting and vivid characterization.  The novel’s brilliant, bedraggled narrator, the Marchesa of Scalea (nicknamed Trinàcria, after the three-legged symbol of Sicily), is always lively, even when speaking from her tomb, full of wisdom, caustic humor and eccentric charm.  Her tragicomic story makes Trinàcria an enormously satisfying historical novel.
~Edward Hower, author of The New Life Hotel and Storms of May
What a great read this novel is, better than a trip to Sicily!  Full of shock and delight, Trinàcria forms a fascinating epic about Bourbon Palermo on the eve of disaster.  In the book's title character, the Marchesa of Scalea, Anthony Di Renzo creates a woman who demonstrates the folly and passion of living life defiantly on the brink.  Few writers are better at showing the intimate, sometimes comic connections between the past and the present, between the old world and the new. If you love drama and discovery, you will enjoy Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily.
~Jeanne Mackin, author of The Sweet By and By and Dreams of Empire
Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily is a completely original look at a long-maligned and misunderstood island—a part of and yet always apart from the modern political construct of Italy. In a work rich with history, Anthony Di Renzo takes the reader into Sicily’s pre-unification past by having the mummified dead of Palermo’s Capuchin catacombs confront a film crew from Italy’s dolce vita era. This fascinating metaphysical and psychological landscape is replete with Redshirts, petty nobility, studio hacks, and two centuries of bitter Sicilian wisdom. ""We all have skeletons in the closet,"" says the Marchesa of Scalea, the novel’s narrator and protagonist. “If they must rattle, they may as well dance.” And dance they do in a macabre but spirited tarantella.
~Paul Paolicelli, author of Dances with Luigi and Under the Southern Sun
Most historical fiction paints the past in flattering oils. Trinàcria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily is etched in acid. Goya could have created this novel’s caustic characters, particularly its protagonist and narrator, Zita Valanguerra Spinelli, the baleful Marchesa of Scalea, whose crest is modeled after the three-legged gorgon of Sicily. Donna Zita recounts her life from a crypt in Palermo’s Capuchin Catacombs. Outrage over lost privilege has given her a posthumous case of acid reflux. But as the Marchesa relives past violations—her land scorched to dust by the pitiless Sicilian sun; her carriage hacked to pieces by Garibaldi’s Red Shits; her crest and nom de plume Trinàcria, the ancient name of Sicily, turned into a label for cheap, mass-produced vinegar—readers learn to sympathize with this spiteful banshee.
Anthony Di Renzo’s masterful, richly textured and layered narrative never hesitates to challenge its own discourse of storytelling, to question the ways craft transforms history into fiction.  But it also poses an ethical challenge. Like the Marchesa, the author confronts our complacency and demands that we examine our own vanities, political hubris, and fragility. Will we take responsibility for our individual and collective histories or float into oblivion, thinking life was all a trick? This spellbinding narrative leaves us with no answers, only the lingering scent of broom.
~Shona Ramaya, author of Flute, Beloved Mother, Queen of Night, and Operation Monsoon

About the Author
A fugitive from advertising, Anthony Di Renzo teaches writing and Italian American history at Ithaca College and has appeared in Alimentum, Il Caffé, Cottonwood Magazine, Essays & Fictions, Feile-Festa, The Normal School, River Styx, Syracuse Scholar, and Voices in Italian Americana. His most recent book Bitter Greens: Essays on Food, Politics, and Ethnicity from the Imperial Kitchen (State University of New York Press, 2010) was praised by Gastonomica: The Journal of Food and Culture.
On a more personal note, Di Renzo on his mother's side descends from Spanish nobility, who settled in Bagheria, Sicily in the early 18th century. He now lives near the West End, Ithaca, New York's former Italian neighborhood, ""an Old World man in a New Age town."" Trinàcria will be his first published novel.

This book campaign is made possible by the Italian Cultural Foundation at Casa Belevedere. A stately Italianate villa with a breathtaking view of the Verrazano Bridge, Casa Belvedere hosts Italian language, culinary, art, and music classes, as well as galas, fashion shows, wine tastings, exhibits, and symposiums focused on Italian themes.
These events open a window to the past.
Last year, the foundation capped its commemoration of the Sesquicentennial of the Risorgimento with a public debate on Italian Unification. Moderated by Cavaliere Vincenzo Marra, this lively exchange between Pino Aprile, author of Terroni (Piemme 2010), and Lorenzo del Boca, author of Polentoni (Piemme 2011) touched upon the often painful historical and political issues discussed in Trinàcria. Click the link below to see this debate:

The Great Debate: Terroni versus Polentoni (November 8, 2011)

Guernica Editions is grateful for Casa Belvedere's support and hopes this novel will contribute to its mission. Mille grazie to founder and president Gina Biancardi and executive director Louis Calvelli!",13.0,0,"3 Campaigns

WE NEED YOUR HELP TO SAVE RUTH STONE'S LEGENDARY LITERARY LANDMARK HOME, FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF POETS AND ARTISTS.
 


After the late poet, Ruth Stone, received the Shelley Award
for poetry in the 1950's, she was able to purchase her farmhouse in Goshen, Vermont. Soon after her husband abruptly took his own life. Widowed,
mother of three, Ruth made a living through poetry--endless struggle though it was. Goshen was the rock that kept everything together; a haven of poetry, art,
music, and community.  The house was
bought, repaired, and held up with poetry. It's no wonder that when she passed away in 2011, she left
her estate in Trust, for the furthering of poetry and the arts. Paving the way for future generations to bask in the same sun.
Since before her death in 2011, Ruth Stone’s treasured home has fallen into grave
disrepair. The Ruth Stone Foundation needs your help now to make critical,
immediate changes to the structure in order to save it. These changes are crucial for the house, as well as the papers, books, and possessions within the house. 
In Ruth's lifetime writers came and went, slept under those old beams, wrote poems on the porches and beside the roaring fireplaces, sharing in the powerful duende of Ruth's haven. 
We want to keep that spirit alive, and the art occurring under the roof thriving. We want to rescue her house so that it might continue, as it once was, to be a poet's house, a place for great minds to come together, to collaborate and break new ground in the arts and science. 
We cannot do that without your help. Whether it's donating to our fund raiser, or simply spreading the word. 

KEEP READING FOR MORE INFORMATION!


“The intensity in this Goshen house offers little room for a middle-ground. It’s passion in the web or out you go in a passion.” –Jan Freeman




Who We Are
Hello! We’re the Ruth Stone
Foundation, a nonprofit literary organization created by the trustees of Ruth
Stone’s estate. Our mission is to celebrate the legacy of poet, Ruth Stone, and
to foster creation of the finest contemporary poetry and art.
The Foundation is based around the
restoration of Ruth Stone’s physical estate in Goshen, Vermont, which will
serve as an intimate writer’s retreat, artist space, and historical landmark. Our mission also focuses on advancing
women poets, providing safe, inspiring environments for them to work on their
craft.
A Breakdown of The Situation 
There are two 1800's houses on the land: a
main house, a very old (two-story) one room house, and well as a small chapel built by Ruth Stone's family in
the 1970’s. The houses have all stood unprotected and ignored for years, and it
wasn’t until after Ruth Stone’s death in 2011 that their problems began to be
seriously addressed. While dedicated to the restoration of this property, we do
not have the funding to go forward with saving it.
We’ve used money we raised in 2013
to work closely with professional architects to assess the amount of damage
done, through detailed descriptions and ""existing condition"" architectural drawings. The estimates of the overall cost to make this a fully functional community space are well over 700,000 dollars. However,
we’re asking for 25,000 to stabilize the house and attend to immediate needs so
that it doesn’t get any worse than it already is.
We have been working tirelessly
with volunteers  over the past two years
to rescue the contents of the house. This is very delicate work, because so
much has been damaged, and is very important to the historical literary
aspect of the house. 
Where Funds from this Campaign Will Go
1. It’s very important work to get Ruth Stone
possessions out of the house, to keep them safe, but also to make way for construction to begin. Part of the funds will go towards storage containers to carefully store the contents of the house, much of which has great, significant literary value
2. Fixing drainage on the house, to dry it out and keep it from further decay
3. Rewiring electricity 
4. Paying the necessary taxes and dues associated with the property 
5. Carpentry to stabilize the house to protect from further damage 


You only have to open a book of
Ruth Stone’s poetry at random to see how important this house was to her
writing. It was her haven, her muse. And she shared that with whomever was
lucky enough to come through the front door.

<h1><b>""Michael, Your Father Won't Be Coming Home...""</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">I was 14 the night my mother told me my father was gone for good.  </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">All my life I'd been promised that ""families are forever""--literally forever--for all eternity.  Then my mother gives me this heart breaking news about my father--he's left and he won't be coming home.<br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><em>What?</em></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><em>What would this mean for our family?</em></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">What I witnessed over the next seven years was devastating for me and for all of us.  I watched my family get torn apart, traumatized and broken by a vicious divorce battle in which the elders in my life took sides and engaged in the battle which left all of us--my parents, my three sisters, two brothers and myself--deeply wounded.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">My story begins here, as an elder brother, grieving the loss of his family, his faith and his religious community, and wondering what his mission in life will be.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">My love for my family would take me on a wild journey of exploration, truth-seeking, adventure and misadventure spanning six continents and many diverse philosophies, cultures and paradigms as I learned how to be a loving, healing, reuniting presence for my family.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Along the way I developed my own body of heart-centered work that has empowered people to stand powerfully connected to their hearts in the face great challenges such as family crises.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Around the world right now, there are people who've used this work to bring sacred reunion their families and to others' families, to honor their parents and elders before they die, to be compassionate activists, and more.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">I want to support these people at the next level.  I want to put a book and other resources in their hands that can empower them to masterfully use this work in their own lives and facilitate it for others.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">So, I've been writing it.  And it's almost finished.<span><br/></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></p>
<h2 style=""font-weight: normal;"">Join Me!</h2>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<p>I wish I could go back in time and give the book I'm writing and my life's work to the 14-year-old Michael and my parents.</p>
<p>I can't do that, but together with your help, we can reach many who might not otherwise find the help they need, and we can reach a far larger audience than I've been able to with my workshops and retreats over the past twelve years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Your help will help reunite families... and may even save lives.</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">  Watch this 3-minute video as a young father and Iraq War veteran, shares about how this work saved his life and allowed him to be present for his wife and children:</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>People may simply receive.  They are welcome to gift back or ""pay it forward,"" if they so desire, but it's not expected.  My heart says GIVE, so I'm saying YES.</p>
<p></p>Those who contribute to this campaign or to me personally, I am calling ""patrons.""  I see a patron as someone who believes in a certain person and their gift, and wants to see that gift EXIST in the world, benefitting humanity.<p></p>
<p>The work I am sharing will go forward no matter how much money is raised by this campaign, because it's simply my work to do.  I view this work as a sacred gift that I am here to give, and so I will.</p>
<p>But it's far more fun to do along with people who believe in each other, and who share a common vision.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>I want partnership.</b> </span><b>How about you?</b>  I want to share myself and my life with people who love deeply and live courageously.  I've created some fun ways to collaborate with you and give back to you, when you become a patron and help fund this project (see the perks).</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>I need $12,000 to self-publish a book which puts my work in the hands of the facilitators, therapists and inspired change agents (like you) around the world who are helping people through my work (or want to).</p></span><p></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This book shares the true stories of me standing for my family, my family standing for each other, and others standing for their families in times of crisis.  In the process, it introduces the reader to the concepts, methods and other resources I have to offer to support them in standing for their family.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The book links to my gifted tools and trainings online, and invite them to attend my gifted events around the world.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3>Help Me Reach $12,000</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To support my path of following my heart and giving big, I've gotten my cost of living down very very low.  $6 a day gets me room, electricity, hot water and wifi!  I can get really inexpensive Thai massages to mitigate long hours on the laptop.  Food is my biggest expense.  I do travel around the world but usually only switch locations when someone gifts me a flight to come offer a workshop in their town.</p>
<p>You can help speed up the process, make it a lot easier for me, and help the book be professionally edited and presented.</p>
<p>I am finishing the book and continue gifting my work, regardless of funding.  This is simply my work to do, but with your help we can reach a far larger audience than I've been able to with my workshops and retreats over the past twelve years.</p>
<p>The costs of independent publishing are minimal.  The level of funding I'm asking for is just for a few months of my costs to live, so I can focus on the writing and creation of the content for everyone.  </p>
<p>My monthly costs of living and sharing my work online are minimal, about $2,000/month.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>$12,000 gets me 3 months of writing/working time (October thru December) plus a $6,000 budget to hire professional help with book design, editing and publishing.</h4>
<p>This is enough time to finish the book, and the downloadable tools and resources it links to, and enough of a budget to be proud about the finished product.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>STRETCH Goal: $24,000 </h3>
<p>If we reach $24,000 I'll announce the next <i><a href=""http://www.visionforce.com/about/istands"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VisionForce iStand</a></i> (the event that the people in the above videos attended).  The week long intensive will be a sacred gift for <a href=""http://www.visionforce.com/theforce/istands/istand-for-soldiers-of-conscience/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soldier of Conscience</a> like <a href=""http://www.visionforce.com/go-visionary/visionary-profile-thad-crouch/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thad Crouch</a> and Gerry Rhis, the two iStand alumni in the video below.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMihZYwt3zY?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>This event is the one I had to cancel for lack of funds.  I've made promises to a lot of people that this event will happen, and people have already put money towards it.  If we reach $24,000 with this campaign, then I can hold this event as a GIFT for 30 or so courageous individuals, many of whom have been jailed and humiliated for taking a stand for being true to their conscience.<span><br/></span> </p>
<h3>Regardless of how much money we raise, I want you to know this campaign is REAL. </h3>
<p>This campaign is not just a big dream or a ""nice idea.""  Your support will result in making a real difference in many people's lives. </p>
<p>This work is already making a difference around the world, and I have a track record of starting and finishing numerous highly creative and original projects, which are currently making a difference around the world.</p>
<p>Right now there are people facilitating this work on several continents.  This book and the resources it links to online will help these people improve their ability to help others.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Fun Ways I Get To Tell You ""THANK YOU"" (Perks for Patrons):</h3>I have an incredible amount of freedom, a huge desire to connect with people and to share this beautiful body of transformational work.  <p></p>
<p>So an EASY and EXCITING perk for me to give you is to spend time with you.  I'm traveling the world.  Consider either coming and joining me at retreats or on adventures, or inviting me to your town to lead a beautiful retreat as a gift to your friends and family.  </p>
<p>You inviting me to share life with you for a while and to give my gift IS a gift to me.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you've got cash in abundance, then even consider our next VisionForce Africa Safari, where we go and serve with the VisionForce work!</p>

<h3><i>$333  Patron Appreciation Party</i></h3>
<p></p>

I was 14 the night my mother told me my father was gone for good.  
All my life I'd been promised that ""families are forever""--literally forever--for all eternity.  Then my mother gives me this heart breaking news about my father--he's left and he won't be coming home.
What?
What would this mean for our family?
What I witnessed over the next seven years was devastating for me and for all of us.  I watched my family get torn apart, traumatized and broken by a vicious divorce battle in which the elders in my life took sides and engaged in the battle which left all of us--my parents, my three sisters, two brothers and myself--deeply wounded.
My story begins here, as an elder brother, grieving the loss of his family, his faith and his religious community, and wondering what his mission in life will be.
My love for my family would take me on a wild journey of exploration, truth-seeking, adventure and misadventure spanning six continents and many diverse philosophies, cultures and paradigms as I learned how to be a loving, healing, reuniting presence for my family.
Along the way I developed my own body of heart-centered work that has empowered people to stand powerfully connected to their hearts in the face great challenges such as family crises.
Around the world right now, there are people who've used this work to bring sacred reunion their families and to others' families, to honor their parents and elders before they die, to be compassionate activists, and more.
I want to support these people at the next level.  I want to put a book and other resources in their hands that can empower them to masterfully use this work in their own lives and facilitate it for others.
So, I've been writing it.  And it's almost finished.

Join Me!

I wish I could go back in time and give the book I'm writing and my life's work to the 14-year-old Michael and my parents.
I can't do that, but together with your help, we can reach many who might not otherwise find the help they need, and we can reach a far larger audience than I've been able to with my workshops and retreats over the past twelve years.

Your help will help reunite families... and may even save lives.  Watch this 3-minute video as a young father and Iraq War veteran, shares about how this work saved his life and allowed him to be present for his wife and children:



The event John attended in 2007 was special, because it was the first time I'd ever gifted the entire event.  We chose 30 people who inspired us by how they were standing for a more beautiful world, and we gifted them our 5-day $2,500 per person VisionForce iStand.
Gifting this event was the most amazing experience of my life.  And you can see how it impacted those who came in the video below:



Gifting my work (rather than selling it) has given my such profound joy, that I'm transitioning my entire ""business model"" to a ""gifting model.""  In fact,



This Book Will Be A Gift...

I'm gifting the ebook version of the book I'm writing (no charge).
I'm gifting almost all of the online tools, resources and trainings it links to online (no charge).
And I'm even gifting most of the trainings, retreats and other events around the world that the book invites people to attend.  In fact, I'd love to gift you the above event (see video) and my other events as well (even if you don't contribute to this campaign).

People may simply receive.  They are welcome to gift back or ""pay it forward,"" if they so desire, but it's not expected.  My heart says GIVE, so I'm saying YES.
Those who contribute to this campaign or to me personally, I am calling ""patrons.""  I see a patron as someone who believes in a certain person and their gift, and wants to see that gift EXIST in the world, benefitting humanity.
The work I am sharing will go forward no matter how much money is raised by this campaign, because it's simply my work to do.  I view this work as a sacred gift that I am here to give, and so I will.
But it's far more fun to do along with people who believe in each other, and who share a common vision.

I want partnership. How about you?  I want to share myself and my life with people who love deeply and live courageously.  I've created some fun ways to collaborate with you and give back to you, when you become a patron and help fund this project (see the perks).
I want adventure.  How about you?  I want to share beautiful adventures with others who are creating the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.  So, I'm creating some special ways you can join me on adventures around the world as well as learning adventures online (see the perks).   
About My VISIONARY HEART Campaign: 
Right now I'm finishing a book called, VISIONARY HEART: Bringing Down My Walls, Standing For My People.  


I need $12,000 to self-publish a book which puts my work in the hands of the facilitators, therapists and inspired change agents (like you) around the world who are helping people through my work (or want to).
This book shares the true stories of me standing for my family, my family standing for each other, and others standing for their families in times of crisis.  In the process, it introduces the reader to the concepts, methods and other resources I have to offer to support them in standing for their family.
The book links to my gifted tools and trainings online, and invite them to attend my gifted events around the world.
It's 70% completed, and with your help I can finish it straight away.  The ebook version will be a gift to all.  But what's most exciting is the book will link to my work online in the form of PDF workbooks, audios, videos and more--which are also a gift to all.
Download A Sample Chapter Here (my gift to you). This sample chapter tells of how a process I call the Honor Window was created when I was confronted one day by a great friend who was a former girlfriend. When you download it, you'll get a sample of what became a very powerful tool in my work with people.
When you download this sample chapter, you'll also get access to the linked resource: The Introductory Honor Window exercise.  You'll get to experience this tool for yourself.
Expected completion date for 1st Release as PDF:  November 15, 2013
Expected completion date for self-published soft-cover on Amazon:  December 15, 2013

Help Me Reach $12,000

To support my path of following my heart and giving big, I've gotten my cost of living down very very low.  $6 a day gets me room, electricity, hot water and wifi!  I can get really inexpensive Thai massages to mitigate long hours on the laptop.  Food is my biggest expense.  I do travel around the world but usually only switch locations when someone gifts me a flight to come offer a workshop in their town.
You can help speed up the process, make it a lot easier for me, and help the book be professionally edited and presented.
I am finishing the book and continue gifting my work, regardless of funding.  This is simply my work to do, but with your help we can reach a far larger audience than I've been able to with my workshops and retreats over the past twelve years.
The costs of independent publishing are minimal.  The level of funding I'm asking for is just for a few months of my costs to live, so I can focus on the writing and creation of the content for everyone.  
My monthly costs of living and sharing my work online are minimal, about $2,000/month.  

$12,000 gets me 3 months of writing/working time (October thru December) plus a $6,000 budget to hire professional help with book design, editing and publishing.
This is enough time to finish the book, and the downloadable tools and resources it links to, and enough of a budget to be proud about the finished product.

STRETCH Goal: $24,000 
If we reach $24,000 I'll announce the next VisionForce iStand (the event that the people in the above videos attended).  The week long intensive will be a sacred gift for Soldier of Conscience like Thad Crouch and Gerry Rhis, the two iStand alumni in the video below.

This event is the one I had to cancel for lack of funds.  I've made promises to a lot of people that this event will happen, and people have already put money towards it.  If we reach $24,000 with this campaign, then I can hold this event as a GIFT for 30 or so courageous individuals, many of whom have been jailed and humiliated for taking a stand for being true to their conscience. 
Regardless of how much money we raise, I want you to know this campaign is REAL. 
This campaign is not just a big dream or a ""nice idea.""  Your support will result in making a real difference in many people's lives. 
This work is already making a difference around the world, and I have a track record of starting and finishing numerous highly creative and original projects, which are currently making a difference around the world.
Right now there are people facilitating this work on several continents.  This book and the resources it links to online will help these people improve their ability to help others.

Fun Ways I Get To Tell You ""THANK YOU"" (Perks for Patrons):I have an incredible amount of freedom, a huge desire to connect with people and to share this beautiful body of transformational work.  
So an EASY and EXCITING perk for me to give you is to spend time with you.  I'm traveling the world.  Consider either coming and joining me at retreats or on adventures, or inviting me to your town to lead a beautiful retreat as a gift to your friends and family.  
You inviting me to share life with you for a while and to give my gift IS a gift to me.  

If you've got cash in abundance, then even consider our next VisionForce Africa Safari, where we go and serve with the VisionForce work!


$333  Patron Appreciation Party

(ALL PATRONS INVITED to All Patron Appreciation Parties!  It doesn't matter whether you contribute $1 or $10,000, you're invited.  Those who choose the $333 perk become a party sponsor and get to host one of these parties.)

<p><strong>Dean J.</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I’m Dean Jewell, for the past 4 years I´ve been uploading videos to my YouTube channel Harry Potter Folklore, gathering tens of millions of views and almost half a million subscribers. This Project was born with the idea of giving back something to the fans.</p>
<p>I want to tell this story in professionally animated form. From voice actors, to re-creating some big characters in animated form, to creating exciting backgrounds, I feel my vision can become a reality. Over 10 years after the Harry Potter books and movies ended, the wizarding world still has one of the biggest fan bases in the world. I've always been that fan who wanted more.</p>
<p><strong>Ed’Studios</strong></p>
<p>All the way from Mexico, this studio formed by incredible talent of young people, not only they animate, they are in charge of the music, sound design, storyboards and  illustrations. </p>
<p>They do everything with passion and it shows in the results. </p>

<p>Animation and all the process behind it cost a good amount of money. For the quality that is needed to do this series justice, i'm attempting to raise $12,000 for the first 2, 4-5 min episodes. This is creating a new world in terms of creating places and characters that have never come to the big screen, especially Tom's father, his grandparents, Hepzibah Smith and we will recreate the moment Tom splits his soul for the first time.</p>
<p>In animation, detail is everything.</p>
<p>Over the last seven months, I have with a group of talented animators and artists, created a trailer of my vision of the tales I want to tell. You can watch the amazing trailer to see what are we creating.</p>

I love this franchise so much and i just want to give something back to the fans of the wizarding world. I love Tom Riddle's story.

</div></div>","Riddle: An Animated Story is an unofficial extension of the Harry Potter story. It tells the tale about the boy who made all the wrong choices, who eventually became the most powerful Dark Wizard of all time.
This animated series will center completely in Tom Marvolo Riddle, aka Lord Voldemort, since his early days in Wool´s Orphanage, to his brilliance way trough and eventual graduation from Hogwarts. This series will also tell the story of the creation of the first horcrux, and his thoughts following his rejection for the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>Sincerity - The Recipe for Living Your Best Personal and Professional Life </i>is about the intersection between the philosophies people often discuss as it relates to Networking (Paying It Forward, Being A Giver, Making Sure You Network) with the actual consistent behaviors that the most successful people do each and every day to maintain success and build additional sincere relationships.<br/><br/>My name is Aaron Brooks and I am the author of <i>Sincerity - The Recipe for Living Your Best Personal and Professional Life</i>. I wrote this book because of the impact sincere relationships have had on my entire life going back to watching the way my father built his business over the past 50 years - one relationship at a time.<br/><br/>As I moved through my own professional career, I realized the impact his example had on the way I have built and maintained amazing relationships over the course of my life and career. I have also personally witnessed sincerity having an amazing impact on the lives of so many people I met over the years. However, I have found it interesting that sometimes these people worked for companies where sincere relationships were not necessarily understood or encouraged. I am lucky enough to have developed many truly sincere relationships over the course of my life (many of which started through business) and I wanted to explore what was unique about these relationships and the way they developed over time. Further – I wanted to share these incredibly inspirational stories so they could be helpful to others. <br/><br/>My hope for this book is that the reader steps out of their comfort zone. Readers will learn about specific steps they can deploy to begin to deepen current relationships and identify new, sincere relationships with others that can grow over time. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement I have for developing and nurturing sincere, 360-degree relationships. If I am successful in helping just a few people to make their lives a bit easier and more fulfilled in this regard through great relationships – much like my own life has been – I will consider the book to be a huge success!<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how to create sincere and authentic relationships and why they matter. You'll read incredibly inspirational stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>My personal story of growing up going to work with my father, seeing how he developed his business literally one sincere relationship at a time. This has led into the way I have done business throughout my professional career that has spanned high level, client facing roles in large staffing and consulting firms - and now working in the marketing space. </li>
<li>You will hear about the sincere and authentic business models of Rock and Roll bands that decided that the music belonged to the fans - specifically the story of The Grateful Dead and on a local Chicago level - a band that has developed a huge national following - Mr Blotto. Rather than selling their music the traditional way - these bands allowed their fans to record their shows. They trusted their fans to share tapes with one another (this was before the internet and digital music sharing), spread their music virally, and buy tickets to shows. </li>
<li>You will read about the story of Mario Armstrong - who is one of the most sincere and passionate people you will experience. You’ve probably seen Mario on TV as a two-time Emmy Award–winning talk show host and Digital Lifestyle Expert® on NBC’s TODAY Show, CNN, NPR, and more. I tell the story of how Mario developed his career one relationship at a time. This is a tremendous story and a perfect example of achieving true success through building and appreciating relationships. </li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are looking for ideas as to how to differentiate yourself personally and professionally and if you are smart, genuine and authentic and you are looking to meet like-minded individuals. This book is for readers that feel they have great ideas – but have been unheard and need to build more sincere personal and professional relationships. It is for those that would sincerely like to build their personal and professional network with real relationships but are not sure where to start. This book will help you shorten the time establishing trusting and sincere relationships through practical steps. <br/><br/><i>Sincerity - The Recipe For Living Your Best Personal and Professional Life</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to people at all points of their lives that want to more intentionally develop deeper, more sincere personal and professional relationships that can change their lives.<br/> <p><strong>The Book</strong></p>The book is written in 2 parts.<br/><br/>The first part of the book is written in six chapters that covers the way most people typically approach business and life, stories about some of the most successful and fulfilled people I have known throughout my career, a couple of examples of businesses and rock and roll bands that have found amazing success through a sincere and authentic business model. It will convince you of the importance of developing as many sincere relationships as you can throughout your life.<br/><br/>The second part of the book is written in one chapter that is split into three sections - it delves into a framework as to how you can intentionally accomplish the goal of identifying and nurturing more of these long term relationships over time. It covers specific ideas for people at the beginning of their career, at the middle of their career, and approaching the end of their career. These steps will take the reader a long way toward developing the sincere relationships that will begin to change their lives.<br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design </strong>for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing </strong>for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion </strong>efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring of 2021.</li>
</ul>

Sincerity - The Recipe for Living Your Best Personal and Professional Life is about the intersection between the philosophies people often discuss as it relates to Networking (Paying It Forward, Being A Giver, Making Sure You Network) with the actual consistent behaviors that the most successful people do each and every day to maintain success and build additional sincere relationships.My name is Aaron Brooks and I am the author of Sincerity - The Recipe for Living Your Best Personal and Professional Life. I wrote this book because of the impact sincere relationships have had on my entire life going back to watching the way my father built his business over the past 50 years - one relationship at a time.As I moved through my own professional career, I realized the impact his example had on the way I have built and maintained amazing relationships over the course of my life and career. I have also personally witnessed sincerity having an amazing impact on the lives of so many people I met over the years. However, I have found it interesting that sometimes these people worked for companies where sincere relationships were not necessarily understood or encouraged. I am lucky enough to have developed many truly sincere relationships over the course of my life (many of which started through business) and I wanted to explore what was unique about these relationships and the way they developed over time. Further – I wanted to share these incredibly inspirational stories so they could be helpful to others. My hope for this book is that the reader steps out of their comfort zone. Readers will learn about specific steps they can deploy to begin to deepen current relationships and identify new, sincere relationships with others that can grow over time. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement I have for developing and nurturing sincere, 360-degree relationships. If I am successful in helping just a few people to make their lives a bit easier and more fulfilled in this regard through great relationships – much like my own life has been – I will consider the book to be a huge success!In this book, you'll learn about how to create sincere and authentic relationships and why they matter. You'll read incredibly inspirational stories such as:

My personal story of growing up going to work with my father, seeing how he developed his business literally one sincere relationship at a time. This has led into the way I have done business throughout my professional career that has spanned high level, client facing roles in large staffing and consulting firms - and now working in the marketing space. 
You will hear about the sincere and authentic business models of Rock and Roll bands that decided that the music belonged to the fans - specifically the story of The Grateful Dead and on a local Chicago level - a band that has developed a huge national following - Mr Blotto. Rather than selling their music the traditional way - these bands allowed their fans to record their shows. They trusted their fans to share tapes with one another (this was before the internet and digital music sharing), spread their music virally, and buy tickets to shows. 
You will read about the story of Mario Armstrong - who is one of the most sincere and passionate people you will experience. You’ve probably seen Mario on TV as a two-time Emmy Award–winning talk show host and Digital Lifestyle Expert® on NBC’s TODAY Show, CNN, NPR, and more. I tell the story of how Mario developed his career one relationship at a time. This is a tremendous story and a perfect example of achieving true success through building and appreciating relationships. 
You will love this book if you are looking for ideas as to how to differentiate yourself personally and professionally and if you are smart, genuine and authentic and you are looking to meet like-minded individuals. This book is for readers that feel they have great ideas – but have been unheard and need to build more sincere personal and professional relationships. It is for those that would sincerely like to build their personal and professional network with real relationships but are not sure where to start. This book will help you shorten the time establishing trusting and sincere relationships through practical steps. Sincerity - The Recipe For Living Your Best Personal and Professional Life is a nonfiction book that speaks to people at all points of their lives that want to more intentionally develop deeper, more sincere personal and professional relationships that can change their lives. The BookThe book is written in 2 parts.The first part of the book is written in six chapters that covers the way most people typically approach business and life, stories about some of the most successful and fulfilled people I have known throughout my career, a couple of examples of businesses and rock and roll bands that have found amazing success through a sincere and authentic business model. It will convince you of the importance of developing as many sincere relationships as you can throughout your life.The second part of the book is written in one chapter that is split into three sections - it delves into a framework as to how you can intentionally accomplish the goal of identifying and nurturing more of these long term relationships over time. It covers specific ideas for people at the beginning of their career, at the middle of their career, and approaching the end of their career. These steps will take the reader a long way toward developing the sincere relationships that will begin to change their lives. What I Need & What You'll Get

I was born with gypsy blood, thirsting to get out and explore mother Earth. I plan on doing all my traveling while I'm still young and single, so I have no one depending on me besides myself. This trip is really a trip of self discovery and to find my true home. It also is to begin my writing career. I'm really into creative writing and have a lot of fiction stories started, I'm just missing the experience of new people to inspire me to continue. And along with that I also want to write about my travels. It will be a really amazing experience that a lot of people will want to read about.</p><p>There is no way to express the gratitude I will have for any amount of donation. You will literally be changing the course of my life and I thank you with all my heart.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Now, the funding may seem like a lot, but I plan to stretch this money over the course of eight months to a year, which is definitely less than the average cost of living. Considering I will be living in my vehicle, this money will be going strictly to gas, food, and camping sites. I don't need much, just the sights I will be seeing and a way to get to where I'm going.</p><p>Now, considering I'm asking for donations, I don't have much to offer. But what I can give it letters and email updates on where I am, how your donation is helping me live my dream, and the promise that when my work gets published, you will get signed copies for no charge.</p><p>If I do not reach my goal, the money will be used sparingly along my trip, and I will definitely be bartering for food (I have faith there are still hippies and gypsy souls out there!). But if I do, and I have money left over, which I'm sure I will, the funding will go towards my backpacking trip to Europe coming in 2016.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>I wish I had words to explain how much this trip will change my life.

I was born with gypsy blood, thirsting to get out and explore mother Earth. I plan on doing all my traveling while I'm still young and single, so I have no one depending on me besides myself. This trip is really a trip of self discovery and to find my true home. It also is to begin my writing career. I'm really into creative writing and have a lot of fiction stories started, I'm just missing the experience of new people to inspire me to continue. And along with that I also want to write about my travels. It will be a really amazing experience that a lot of people will want to read about.There is no way to express the gratitude I will have for any amount of donation. You will literally be changing the course of my life and I thank you with all my heart.What I Need & What You GetNow, the funding may seem like a lot, but I plan to stretch this money over the course of eight months to a year, which is definitely less than the average cost of living. Considering I will be living in my vehicle, this money will be going strictly to gas, food, and camping sites. I don't need much, just the sights I will be seeing and a way to get to where I'm going.Now, considering I'm asking for donations, I don't have much to offer. But what I can give it letters and email updates on where I am, how your donation is helping me live my dream, and the promise that when my work gets published, you will get signed copies for no charge.If I do not reach my goal, the money will be used sparingly along my trip, and I will definitely be bartering for food (I have faith there are still hippies and gypsy souls out there!). But if I do, and I have money left over, which I'm sure I will, the funding will go towards my backpacking trip to Europe coming in 2016.The ImpactI wish I had words to explain how much this trip will change my life. It will determine where I decide to live, how my writing career kicks off, and what salon I will be working in. Not to mention the fact that I will be volunteering along the way, so it will be helping others as well. I just want to find something bigger than myself and I feel this is the best way to do it.Other Ways You Can HelpNow, I totally understand if you can't help me financially, but there are other ways to support my cause!

<h3>I've always been in love with the stage, but as a spectator, not a performer.  Burlesque is a love of mine, and so are pinup girls. Now I want to share that with you in a gorgeous, tantalizing burlesque book that will appeal to the food lover in you.</h3>
<h3>I've been writing the recipes and have done the first shoot, but this project is not cheap. From whipping up luscious cakes to paying for photography, I need help getting this project off the ground. Can you help?</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Dakota, and I'm a freelance journalist and grad student living in New York. Thanks for coming to my Indiegogo page.</p>
<p>I've written about arts, news and style in New York for seven years or so, and I finally decided, after being encouraged by a friend, to take the plunge into working on a book. It's really hard and a lot of work, but I'm really excited so far and still loving it.</p>
<p>Self-publishing is always expensive in color, and this cookbook demands it because of the gorgeous subjects, performers and food included. Venues, lights, photography, food, styling of food and makeup and fashion are also very expensive. I'm doing what I can to have friends help out with styling and venues, but I need your help!</p>
If you can help me get my project off the ground, a beautiful new cookbook documenting some of New York's favorite burlesque gals will soon be a reality, and we'll get to see a more personal side of them than just the stage persona.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The perks are pretty awesome! Gorgeous photos to put in your room by your mirror, copies of the cookbook in all its food-and-femininity-obsessed glory, or a personal night of being guided to meet the best of New York's burlesque shows by yours truly!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you can't contribute but you can help me spread the word by emailing or sharing this Indiegogo page on Twitter or Facebook, snapping a shot for Instagram, posting it anywhere, I'll be eternally grateful!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And PS, Indiegogo lets me keep most of what I raise here -- instead of returning contributions if I don't meet my goal -- just another reason I love this site!</div>

<h3>WOLVES: Short Summary</h3>
<p>by Martin De Biasi</p>
<p>Needle in the Hay was founded in 2012 with the aim of providing access to regular short story prizes and feedback for the broader grassroots writing community. Over the past few years we've broadened our scope to publishing, with a focus on collaborative publications. </p>
<p>Wolves is our second fully published collaboration. It brings together some of our best and brightest authors under a decidely wolfish banner, with stories that span the gamut of human experience and emotion.</p>
<p>When individuals commit to a common goal, we form a pack. The WOLVES pack has worked hard on this collection, and that's why it's essential we get behind them and support this project.</p>
<p>As a contributor, you're showing writers around the world that authors (and artists) can come together and produce great work, and be supported by their community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is to make as big a splash as possible. The more backers we get for this campaign, the more encouraged our authors will be to publish even better works, and the more we're able to build the profile of all the writers involved in Needle In The Hay. </p>
<p>Our funding model is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign gives you the opportunity to get a physical copy of the book at cost price</li>
<li>We'll mail the book to you.</li>
<li>You can also buy multiple copies :)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution makes a big difference. Even if you don't want a book, a few dollars will get you a digital copy and still demonstrate to our authors and other up and coming writers that there is an interest in grassroots publications and a demand for a more intimate relationship between authors and readers. </p>
<p>Every author on Wolves is in the early stages of their career. Some have been toiling away for a few years, others are a bit newer to the game. Either way, your support helps build their profiles and confidence for bigger challenges ahead. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's really nothing to lose here. Even if we don't make our goal we can still send you the book. This campaign is about awareness and support. The more, the better!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it, sometimes you're just not in the position right now to support us. Never fear, if you can't back Wolves right now, there are other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repost, reblog and share this page with as many people as you can. That helps build awareness. Indiegogo provides sharing tools right here on the campaign page, so use em!</li>
<li>Go check out <a href=""http://needleinthehay.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Needle In The Hay</a>, follow us on Facebook, and try your hand at a story comp.</li>
<li>Volunteer at Needle: We're always looking for volunteers to help judge one awards, create new awards and give feedback. </li>
<li>Read our shortlists! </li>
</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it. WOLVES is an awesome collaboration, I hope you love it. </p></div>","WOLVES: Short Summary

<p>Heritage Salon Magazine is a new and innovative way to expose African-American Museums, Cultural Institutions &amp; Historic Homes &amp; Sites. This all began from a vision from me, Jada Wright-Greene. I have a strong passion for the African-American Museum Culture and believe it is my duty to expose these institutions.  I began this journey with a blog in 2009 after I discovered I was the first African-American to graduate from the Museum Studies Program at Michigan State University.  I have worked in several museums, historic homes and earned a Master’s Degree in Urban &amp; Regional Planning/Museum Studies. Since my discovery of the museum studies field, I have not stopped emailing, calling and reaching out to museums in order to make a change. I have the passion, persistence and determination to make the change in this field. I consider myself to be an activist for the change in museums.  </p>
<p>There is a need to have more audience participation at African-American focused institutions in order to gain more attention and possible funding to these entities. Another need is for more African-Americans to be enrolled and completing Museum Studies programs in order to gain the proper knowledge to operate and sustain these institutions. </p>
<p>At this juncture Heritage Salon Magazine is in the beginning stages of acquiring 501 (c) (3) status.   Once this status is acquired, funds will be solicted with the (assistance of the production of a preview issue) from foundations, corporations and donors.  Heritage Salon Magazine will be FREE of cost to everyone once full issues are published in 2013! </p>
<p>At this time, there are no other publications dedicated to the African-American Museum Culture. It is imperative that this one of a kind magazine is published in order to change the face of the Museum Field. </p>
<p><strong>What Heritage Salon Magazine Needs</strong></p>
<p>Heritage Salon Magazine needs $1,800 to publish, print and mail out over 350 preview issues throughout the United States to African-American focused institutions, schools, universities and individuals that can assist in the efforts of the full publication of 4 issues a year.  The funds will go to publishing, printing, production of mailing materials and postage for over 350 copies of the preview issue as well as Indiegogo fees.  </p>
<p>If you contribute to the preview issue you will be contributing to the impact of changing the way people view African-American museums and cultural institutions.  If I am not able to raise all of the funds, I will still produce some issues to go to a pivotal list of institutions and individuals.  Heritage Salon Magazine is offering the following incentives for your assistance in our efforts</p>

From August 15 to September 8, you can head to our campaign site EqualityFTW.org to donate and receive some delightfully nerdy and awesome perks for supporting Equality FTW. During these three weeks, be on the lookout for videos from favorite vloggers and wizards alike. We’re going to be teaming up with some awesome people to help us reach our $50,000 goal and we’re counting on you to be one of them!  Just like Harry and Dumbledore fought for equality amongst magic users and muggles, we  too are fighting for immigration reform, LGBTQ rights and equal access to education.  Our Equality for the Win fundraiser is a drive to raise $50,000 so that we can strengthen our fight to equal the playing field. With your donation and your help we can launch a year of equality based campaigns to fight the dark arts of inequality. We are Wizards. We are the Equality Generation. So what is the Harry Potter Alliance anyway? 
The Harry Potter Alliance or HPA is a non-profit organization that uses parallels from the Harry Potter novels to inspire fans to act as heroes in our world. The HPA is run almost entirely by more than 60 volunteer staff and 85 worldwide community and school chapters. Using social media and our partner networks, we have a reach of more than one million people. These vast connections allow us to act as a Dumbledore’s Army for the real world, reaching to fans across the globe to enact real change in our communities and our world. For more information on our previous work, check out these success stories: http://thehpalliance.org/action/campaigns/Where will my money go? We hold these truths to be self evident that all men (and women, and undocumented Americans, and children, and...) are created equal. Regardless of where you’re from, who you love, or how much money you have, we believe that we all deserve the same rights and opportunities. Over the past 7 years we have rallied for equality, donating over 90,000 books to communities across the world, breaking phone banking records with Massachusetts equality and took the world by storm with Julian’s Muggleborn American video, getting over 10,000 views in one day. But we’re not done yet, witches! What if we could: 

Build a network of Imagine Better Libraries connecting students across the world with the magic of books and launch a new curriculum of myth-based education.
Educate members and the public about immigration reform, standing with undocumented Americans around the country. 
Expand the fight for Marriage equality into three new states - Maine, Maryland and Minnesota. 
Help our chapters bring the fight for equality into their hometowns and states by building our chapters network and providing the resources they need to bring the fight home
We can do it, but we need your help! With $50,000 we can change the face of equality across the world. Join us by making a donation today!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony Wong and I am the author of <i>A Shape and a Run</i>!<br/><br/><i>A Shape and a Run</i> is a collection of short stories centered around the concept of isolation: its origins, manifestations and effects on people. Through the lens of the surreal and the mundane, this book explores what it means to be alone — and in the process, what it means to change.<br/><br/>I wrote this book in an attempt to explore the demoralizing feelings that I think a lot of people are having or have had at some point throughout the COVID-19 pandemic — these feelings of apathy and grief and aimlessness that have gained a hold on the public consciousness. Many people are forced to be apart right now, and that shared state of loneliness is something that taps into an entire fountainhead of emotions sprung from different circumstances and life experiences.<br/><br/>I hope people will find something in this collection that resonates with them. The stories span a range of genres and tend to blend varying levels of light and dark elements within each of them.  As you read these stories, you might find some of them have a few twists you weren’t expecting, with a level of unpredictability that will keep you, the reader, entertained and on your toes.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter a host of characters that inhabit a variety of settings. The theme of isolation runs through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two men stuck in a dystopian, abandoned coastal town of Maine, with one’s murderous goals restrained only by the fear of being the last remaining survivor.</li>
<li>A hermetic music composer who struggles to reconcile his work with the pain of being newly alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Most importantly though, especially in this turbulent world that we’re in, this book strives to reaffirm a sense of agency that the current times seem to have taken away. Even if you are alone, or feeling alone, you can find solace in the things in your life that still make it worth living. I hope my stories communicate the idea that despite the pain and adversity one might face, life isn’t over until it actually is, and the world doesn’t end until it actually does.<br/><br/>I look forward to exploring the themes of isolation, hope, and change in these stories and with readers.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this April.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish plus an Instagram shoutout!</li>
<li>You will receive original art stickers made for my book!</li>

<h3>
<strong>This series is UNIQUE and offers growth potential in a stagnant marketplace.<br/></strong>
</h3>
<h3>
<strong><br/>With a plot stemming from a unique and original sci-fi core, there's nothing quite like it on the YA market today. It fills a niche that hasn't yet been conquered in YA - sci-fi. <br/></strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>Each volume in the series is narrated by a different character, driving the story forward in a new and exciting way for readers. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Fluorescence evolves from a quiet beginning into a gritty and unabashed look at real-life limitations and struggles these teenagers face while coping with a life-changing secret.<br/></strong></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>
<b>Q.</b><strong>  So if Fluorescence is so groundbreaking, why does it need funding?</strong>
</h3>
<p><b><br/>A.</b>   Good question! <b>The answer to that is simple</b> - <b>funding </b>= <b>marketing</b>. <b>Marketing </b>= the <b>ability to build a fan-base and gain an audience,</b> which in turn, can <b>= success</b>. Think about it: how many books/movies/TV Shows, etc. would you have found out about or purchased if you'd never seen a commercial/flyer/or other promotional blurb about it? Probably few to none.</p>
<p>No matter how good something is, if no one knows it exists, it can't make an impact. This doesn't mean it's not a good product, it often only means the marketing failed. <br/></p>

Fluorescence is an upcoming 4-part YA book series about a group of teenagers who are Implanted with glowing alien DNA which grants each of them unique and powerful abilities, but may also jeopardize the future of the human race. 



For art to thrive, it needs to be seen. Read. Touched. It’s about getting it into people’s hands. 


But without a massive publishing house and a limitless budget, that's tough! 
YOU can change that!






This series is UNIQUE and offers growth potential in a stagnant marketplace.


With a plot stemming from a unique and original sci-fi core, there's nothing quite like it on the YA market today. It fills a niche that hasn't yet been conquered in YA - sci-fi. 

Each volume in the series is narrated by a different character, driving the story forward in a new and exciting way for readers. 
Fluorescence evolves from a quiet beginning into a gritty and unabashed look at real-life limitations and struggles these teenagers face while coping with a life-changing secret.


Q.  So if Fluorescence is so groundbreaking, why does it need funding?

A.   Good question! The answer to that is simple - funding = marketing. Marketing = the ability to build a fan-base and gain an audience, which in turn, can = success. Think about it: how many books/movies/TV Shows, etc. would you have found out about or purchased if you'd never seen a commercial/flyer/or other promotional blurb about it? Probably few to none.
No matter how good something is, if no one knows it exists, it can't make an impact. This doesn't mean it's not a good product, it often only means the marketing failed. 






The success of this book, upcoming installments and myself as an author, relies solely on getting 



Fluorescence in front of people!

<p>I recently released my third <em>Thompson Sisters</em> novel, The Last Hour, which has been receiving rave reviews and reasonably decent sales. I’m now hard at work on a new project, and more importantly, for the first time, writing full time! It’s exciting, but a little bit scary, because living off primarily ebook sales can be a real challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I asking for money for this project?</strong><br/> The Thompson Sisters is now a well established series of novels. But the cost of narrating, editing and producing an audiobook is a lot of money. Thousands of dollars.  As a brand new full time writer with bills to pay and kids to feed, it’s a lot of money to risk on a venture which may or may not earn back those thousands of dollars.  That’s where you come in. By running this campaign, the risk is spread, the book can be produced, and readers will get their copies. Your money will go into the production of the audiobook.</p>
<p><strong>What Will This Project Produce?</strong></p>
<p>The project will produce an unabridged audiobook version of The Last Hour.  This is a long book, and I anticipate the final version will be close to fifteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>Who Will Be Narrating the Audiobook?</strong></p>
<p>The audiobook will be professionally narrated by two outstanding voice actors: Jack Wallen and Alana Rader.  Jack and Alana also narrated A Song for Julia, which was just released on Audible.com this week.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>
<p>The rewards for participating in this campaign start with a digital copy of the audiobook and ebook.  Note that some of the rewards (for the ebook) will ship immediately; others (the completed audiobook) won’t go out until the recording is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The goal for this campaign is $4,000. However, I’m putting in some stretch goals for specific amounts, they are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, if the campaign makes $6,000, I’ll publish an exclusive <em>Julia and Crank</em> novella this fall, and everyone who participated in the campaign will a free e-copy of the book.</li>
<li>If the campaign makes more than $6,000 I’ll come up with some other awesome stretch goals.</li>
</ul><p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will rewards ship outside the USA or Canada?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes!</strong> For rewards that require physical shipping, I’ll send them anywhere. Assuming you have postal services.</p>
<p><strong>What format will the audiobooks be released in?</strong></p>
<p>The audiobook will be released on Audible, iTunes and Amazon in Audible.com’s format. However, for those of you who pledge at the $25 or higher level, you’ll get a digital download of the completed audiobook in MP3 format with no DRM.</p>
<p><strong>What format will ebooks be in?</strong></p>
<p>Ebooks will be included in mobi or epub format (your preference) with no DRM, or via Amazon or Nook gift.</p>

<p>You can pick any of my ebook titles with the exception of the boxed set.  I’ll send those via Amazon or Nook, or if you prefer in non-DRM epub or mobi.</p>
<p><strong>When will I get my rewards?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll send out rewards on a weekly basis for those which are available now (ebook and print books).  The audiobook will be made available as soon as production is complete (scheduled for the end of august)</p>

Wogglebug T.E.. Mr. Wogglebug started out as a tiny ordinary bug and after spending years in a one-room schoolhouse, secretly learning from the wise professor and the students, he was found and projected onto a magnifying screen to the size of an adult human. The moment he had the chance, he escaped from the magnifying screen and left the schoolhouse to venture out into the world and see it from the perspective humans see it but insects cannot, and also to interact with the human world on a level no insect of any normal standards ever could. He believed himself to be worthy of admiration and capable of being a strong role model for young children. A steadfast hero for the importance of education, knowledge, and learning. As well as a staunch hero for the world of the fantasy genre at large. Which people of all ages in this day and age delight in with all forms of entertainment and art.  </p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437524369/wpxbncwvr2fngwq0mmql.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 599.290187891441px; height: 463px;""/></p>Mr. Wogglebug is to be the center of influence of, as well as to help children view the great picture of the journey called life. He is a positive hero toward the benefiting of the education, entertainment, and overall fulfilling enjoyment of the children of new generations. My movies and picture books portray him from beginning to end as always courteous, optimistic, and skillfully intelligent in the face of any and all situations.<div>
<br/><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">My movies involve the Wogglebug having the same origins he had in Oz but except they take place in a Land called Genoma. There he befriends a six-year-old girl from our world and from there on he starts on a journey that intertwines with hers. They have an adventure rescuing the Enchanted Forest from being overruled by darkness as the Wogglebug with a bit of help from Sylvie passes the tests of demonstrating the Seven Living Values of Intelligence (Honesty, Courage, Perseverance, Courtesy, Kindness, Loyalty, and Humility) while he succeeds at teaching her to believe in herself. This movie also contains messages about how nature grows and flourishes and how we can help it to survive as a whole environment.<br/></span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Next the Wogglebug retraces his origins and rescues his old schoolteacher, Professor Nowitall from imprisonment by a demented magician, and with the aid of a couple of gentle troll wizards he also finds the Four Keys of All Wisdom. The four keys to wisdom are: intelligence through honesty and good intentions, deep unconditional love, optimism in the joy of living, and all-natural growth. These he uses to succeed at every obstacle in his journeys to come when he and Sylvie next go on a quest to find magical artifacts through the skies via airship, on the ocean via a sailing ship, and on land in various ways, and encounter many places and creatures in many twists and turns of their own journeys.<span><br/></span></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span><br/></span>The next</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> movie starring the Wogglebug is a ""stranger in a strange land"" type of film in which he is transported into New York, and in the spirit of all the best Family Films, he changes the reality of a group of humans for the better before he leaves their dimension for his own again. He himself discovers along the way the very meaning of what true love always is no matter what kind it is, or how it is given or received. </span>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">He grows in his perspective and his status in Genoma at the same rate as Sylvie grows up in her world and gains deeper education through the wisdom he teaches her which enables her to ease through her personal problems that arise over the years. In the end of the film series he makes a triumphant return to the real world when Sylvie, Tasha, and Eleanor are young adults and he helps a gentle space creature to get his message to the people of Earth, restore the galaxy's colors, and thus prevent any war among the cosmos from ever starting.</span></div>

</div></div>","IntroductionI am beginning a whole new franchise that is both the start of something new and also founded on a century old character from the public domain. The central character of this franchise of movies, books, audio-programs and other products to come is the character of Mr. H.M. Wogglebug T.E.. Mr. Wogglebug started out as a tiny ordinary bug and after spending years in a one-room schoolhouse, secretly learning from the wise professor and the students, he was found and projected onto a magnifying screen to the size of an adult human. The moment he had the chance, he escaped from the magnifying screen and left the schoolhouse to venture out into the world and see it from the perspective humans see it but insects cannot, and also to interact with the human world on a level no insect of any normal standards ever could. He believed himself to be worthy of admiration and capable of being a strong role model for young children. A steadfast hero for the importance of education, knowledge, and learning. As well as a staunch hero for the world of the fantasy genre at large. Which people of all ages in this day and age delight in with all forms of entertainment and art.  Mr. Wogglebug is to be the center of influence of, as well as to help children view the great picture of the journey called life. He is a positive hero toward the benefiting of the education, entertainment, and overall fulfilling enjoyment of the children of new generations. My movies and picture books portray him from beginning to end as always courteous, optimistic, and skillfully intelligent in the face of any and all situations.

My movies involve the Wogglebug having the same origins he had in Oz but except they take place in a Land called Genoma. There he befriends a six-year-old girl from our world and from there on he starts on a journey that intertwines with hers. They have an adventure rescuing the Enchanted Forest from being overruled by darkness as the Wogglebug with a bit of help from Sylvie passes the tests of demonstrating the Seven Living Values of Intelligence (Honesty, Courage, Perseverance, Courtesy, Kindness, Loyalty, and Humility) while he succeeds at teaching her to believe in herself. This movie also contains messages about how nature grows and flourishes and how we can help it to survive as a whole environment.


Next the Wogglebug retraces his origins and rescues his old schoolteacher, Professor Nowitall from imprisonment by a demented magician, and with the aid of a couple of gentle troll wizards he also finds the Four Keys of All Wisdom. The four keys to wisdom are: intelligence through honesty and good intentions, deep unconditional love, optimism in the joy of living, and all-natural growth. These he uses to succeed at every obstacle in his journeys to come when he and Sylvie next go on a quest to find magical artifacts through the skies via airship, on the ocean via a sailing ship, and on land in various ways, and encounter many places and creatures in many twists and turns of their own journeys.The next movie starring the Wogglebug is a ""stranger in a strange land"" type of film in which he is transported into New York, and in the spirit of all the best Family Films, he changes the reality of a group of humans for the better before he leaves their dimension for his own again. He himself discovers along the way the very meaning of what true love always is no matter what kind it is, or how it is given or received. 



He grows in his perspective and his status in Genoma at the same rate as Sylvie grows up in her world and gains deeper education through the wisdom he teaches her which enables her to ease through her personal problems that arise over the years. In the end of the film series he makes a triumphant return to the real world when Sylvie, Tasha, and Eleanor are young adults and he helps a gentle space creature to get his message to the people of Earth, restore the galaxy's colors, and thus prevent any war among the cosmos from ever starting.




What We Need & What You Get

The target goal I've set is $500 with flexible funding.




The perks I have come up with, along with the aid of Richard Poshard  as the voice of the Wogglebug, are to give all contributors a general idea of what the overall franchise of WogglebugLove Productions is about at this point.
Donators of $1.00 receive my gratitude in that they support this franchise. The higher donations receive this and  more. As listed:
Donators of $10 receive the DVD of the first movie ""The Wogglebug's First Adventure with Sylvie: Rescue of the Enchanted Forest."" In which the Wogglebug and Sylvie have their first adventure discovering things about each other while going on a quest to save the environment of the land of Genoma from destruction by connecting the elements of the greater picture in the forest.
Donators of $25.00 receive the above and also the picture book version of the movie as illustrated by Richard Walsh.Donators of $35.00 receive all the above and a DVD of the second movie ""The Wogglebug's Adventure in New York"" in which he is transported to the real world via a science experiment linked in two dimensions and when he enters the lives of the family of the scientist who brought him in he brightens and renews their happiness in being together.
Donators of $50 receive the above and also can choose one of these 7 images from either the picture books designed by Richard Walsh or from the actual movies filmed by me.
          










Donators of $75 receive a specialized custom-made calendar with pages above the monthly charts that are from either Richard Walsh's pictures, or stills from short films done by me.




Donators of $100 receive  a ""12 inch tall Wogglebug plushie that is in the design of Richard Walsh's illustrations and also from how he looks in my movies. He is custom made by a renowned toy maker and very cuddly and highly prized.


Donators of $150 receive  paperback copies of 7 picture books about the Wogglebug's new  life in Genoma, as illustrated by Richard Walsh. 
1. The Wogglebug and Sylvie's Rescue of the Enchanted Forest2. The Wogglebug and the Four Keys of Wisdom3. How the Wogglebug met the Frogman4. How the Wogglebug Saved the Tailor5. The Wogglebug's  Book of Manners 6. The Wogglebug's Fun With Seasons and Holidays 7. The Wogglebug's Methods to Finding Lost Things



Just as these books are excellent for beginning readers, Walsh's illustrations of the Wogglebug have the authentic look and feel of a cuddly creature any child or adult could feel the urge to hug.
Donators of $175 receive the above and also another picture book that contains the first of the ""What did the Wogglebug Say?""  endings. This is something children will be invited to figure out for a secret prize before it is revealed in the short film based off of it at the Wogglebug  Productions Website.  The Secret Prize will be told of during an episode of the Wogglebug's Visual  Podcast.  Donators of $200 receive  audiobook downloads  of the aforementioned picture books via Audible.com. As narrated by Richard Poshard, the audio versions of these books bring the Wogglebug's image and  personality within the book amazingly to life.
Donators of $250 receive  paperback copies of the novelizations of  the movies listed. These novelizations help enable readers of all ages to have the insights that I put into these films and the ones to come.Donators of $275  receive  an exclusive ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" storybook by Cynthia Hanson. The Wogglebug's First  Interactive Adventure which features adventures in many various ways, places, and with many outcomes.

Donators of $300 receive a customized picture book and mini-movie of 10 - 15 minutes to be dedicated to a specific child you either have or know of to give them a happy birthday gift. The maximum available for these is limited to five individuals. Only up to 5 individual donators are eligible for this per year.


After the campaign closes they must email me this basic information: The child's name, birth date, gender, geographical location, pet, favorite activity, favorite color. How they would like to meet with Mr. Wogglebug, the first place in the video they would like to visit, their dream for their future; and any special important message you want to give them. All these are what will make the individual films unique to the individually unique children receiving them. They will be digitally delivered at around the due date of the child's birthday. They also will be shown exclusively on the WogglebugLove Productions website's video page.

 The funds are needed by me for the following purposes in order of importance:
1. For the label and trademark name and branding to become official and under the legal copyright ownership of me and my custom publishing brand. A deposit must be made up front to the trademark lawyers she has consulted with. This is to be the most expensive task for her. Also the most important as it will protect and secure the overall trademark and copyright she wishes for.


2. My payments to Richard Poshard, who voices the Wogglebug as a professional voice actor. He requires payments for any work he lends his talents to that involves profits. Which is involved in self-publishing books and DVDs and audio-books.

3. My payments to the picture book artist Richard Walsh for illustrations of her Wogglebug based picture books. These will present the Wogglebug teaching subjects in simple and specific ways which often prove to be very good for early education. 

4. Last but not least, any remaining funds can go to have the 3D animation starter movies I make starring the Wogglebug entered into film festivals around the country. Either before or after they are released to DVD, depending on the requirements of the film festivals. 
The Impact:

All of this is to be the start of a small franchise for the Wogglebug's rise to fame which will lead into a much larger franchise in the next ten to twenty years from now which I wish to do my best to work towards with the aid of supporters. 

I'm one who supports The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. I fully intend to have the Wogglebug rise to fame in being a positive role model for children in learning how to develop the value of learning to use logic and reasoning skills to find out the right answers, and to think for themselves in the face of adversary.

The Wogglebug is even more than this. He is an ideal role model for today's children to be able to gain the ability to believe in themselves when they seem or feel different from all others around them. Such as children on the autism spectrum which I myself had been at least during my childhood, and thus I really believe a character just like Mr. Wogglebug would have made a world of a positive difference for me then. And so I now wish to express these deep feelings to the children of new generations so we can help to make the future brighter for them and the rest of the world, as the children of this generation are the citizens of the next one.
In conclusion, making a donation of any amount to my campaign is to help bring rise to the start of the Wogglebug's franchise and fame. Thus to also support every cause he is involved with. All meant to help make a brighter future for our next generation.


Other Ways You Can Help

If you believe in giving second chances and in making a difference for the children of today and the future by all means be a supporter of the Wogglebug's franchise.

<h3>What's happening?<br/>

<p>Hi, I’m Lisa Tallin. I gave up a good social
work job in Boston to follow my dream of becoming a writer. I began by moving to Alabama to study creative writing. During my
studies, I finished a novel and poetry manuscript. I graduated with an MFA in
May 2013 and during this last year I’ve worked on smaller pieces of prose and
poetry as well as the first draft of my second novel. In June, my chapbook

I applied for a full fellowship and was given a partial grant. I decided to take the offer because I didn't want to pass up this prestigious opportunity and because I desperately need this time to write. While at the center,
I’ll benefit from the time, space, and solitude needed to complete the editing of my young adult novel, <i>Year of the Buried Elephant</i> (pictured above).

and it will span the globe. We live in a multicultural, multi-ethnic,
multilingual, multi-abled world and I want to create a world on the page that
reflects this modern reality. Growing up, I was a voracious reader, but I was

<li><p>With $700 from Generation Progress, we need $4,300 to get back to our usual financial place. Printing costs about $1,084 a pop, and we come out four times a year. Rent costs $240 a month, which we use 9 months in the year. </p></li>
<li><p>We want to thank you in any way we can for your donations! We’ve pooled together our talents, resources and connections in the Gainesville community to offer perks for your money. All are locally based and are meant to give you a good flavor of us as a publication and Gainesville as a city. And everything comes with a hearty dose of our most sincere gratitude. </p></li>

<li><p>Every dollar you donate will help us send to print, even if we don’t reach our entire goal. As a volunteer-run publication, anything helps!</p></li>
</ul><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your money will keep The Fine Print running and publishing physical copies of the magazine, as well as our yearly writing and arts journal, Prairie. While we could make the switch to publishing online-only, we believe strongly that both publications are made to be read in print. Here's why:</p><ul>
<li><p>Among the serious, socially conscious articles we like to sprinkle crosswords and cut-out games. (We once had a Fine Print fortuneteller! There were Beyonce jokes!)</p></li>
<li><p>We also make <a href=""http://www.thefineprintuf.org/2014/04/25/dont-be-stressin-about-the-legislative-session/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">infographics</a> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> that sum up important news or events (or even just tell you <a href=""http://www.thefineprintuf.org/2014/04/25/navigating-grid-system/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">how to get around</a> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span>) which you can rip out and keep with you. </p></li>
<li><p>Prairie is its own physical experience (not to toot our own horn), printed on thick, textured paper and hand-bound with twine.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading from a physical, printed copy is a particular pleasure. We want to encourage you to retain that tiny joy, because we feel it too. </p></li>
</ul><p>Your money could also help The Fine Print expand. We always hope to add pages, which lengthens our stories to provide more in-depth reporting and storytelling. We want to support more new, young writers, photographers, illustrators and designers who also feel an urge to contribute to the community. With more pages, we can publish a more robust and detailed issue. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Even if you can’t spare the cash, we could still use your help. Share this campaign -- verbally or virtually -- to help us spread the word! Any time you take out of your day to help us we sincerely appreciate, and we hope to continue providing you with locally grown, lovingly produced journalism and art.<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/836528/files/20140905095749-Indiegogo_fourth.jpg?1409936269"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryThe Fine Print is a quarterly magazine based in Gainesville, Fla., that publishes locally focused, socially conscious journalism.

We want to press a copy into your hands when you see us tabling. We love seeing people pick up an issue for the first time and linger on the pages, then flipping to the front and reading it again.And with your help, we can make up the lost funds and continue putting out seasonal issues that you can hold in your hands, hot off the press. What We Need & What You Get
With $700 from Generation Progress, we need $4,300 to get back to our usual financial place. Printing costs about $1,084 a pop, and we come out four times a year. Rent costs $240 a month, which we use 9 months in the year. 
We want to thank you in any way we can for your donations! We’ve pooled together our talents, resources and connections in the Gainesville community to offer perks for your money. All are locally based and are meant to give you a good flavor of us as a publication and Gainesville as a city. And everything comes with a hearty dose of our most sincere gratitude. 
Although we have packages of merchandise, if you would like to purchase individual pieces, check out our online shop here . There you can also find our exclusive Indiegogo campaign poster, made by the lovely Emma Roulette. 
Every dollar you donate will help us send to print, even if we don’t reach our entire goal. As a volunteer-run publication, anything helps!
The ImpactYour money will keep The Fine Print running and publishing physical copies of the magazine, as well as our yearly writing and arts journal, Prairie. While we could make the switch to publishing online-only, we believe strongly that both publications are made to be read in print. Here's why:
Among the serious, socially conscious articles we like to sprinkle crosswords and cut-out games. (We once had a Fine Print fortuneteller! There were Beyonce jokes!)
We also make infographics  that sum up important news or events (or even just tell you how to get around ) which you can rip out and keep with you. 
Prairie is its own physical experience (not to toot our own horn), printed on thick, textured paper and hand-bound with twine.
Reading from a physical, printed copy is a particular pleasure. We want to encourage you to retain that tiny joy, because we feel it too. 
Your money could also help The Fine Print expand. We always hope to add pages, which lengthens our stories to provide more in-depth reporting and storytelling. We want to support more new, young writers, photographers, illustrators and designers who also feel an urge to contribute to the community. With more pages, we can publish a more robust and detailed issue. Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can’t spare the cash, we could still use your help. Share this campaign -- verbally or virtually -- to help us spread the word! Any time you take out of your day to help us we sincerely appreciate, and we hope to continue providing you with locally grown, lovingly produced journalism and art.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The French have a saying, ""The best part of an affair is going up the stairs"". And so it’s been that way for me with my 89-year affair with life. For me, the anticipation of finding the unexpected has been the equivalent of 'going up the stairs'. ~ Bernie Feshbach</p>

<p>An extraordinary man who's lived an extraordinary life.</p>
<p>Ten different careers spanning the course of seventy plus years. All varied, all unexpected or as Bernie likes to call it, serendipitous.

(Seriously, if you've ever wanted to live vicariously through someone, it should be this guy.)</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing Furrier</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I borrow $7,500 in 1942 from my Mom and go into the business of manufacturing fur coats. I was 17 years old and my Pop naturally gave me fabulous 'guidance'. My Pop was the smartest, most giving person I've ever known.</p>
<p><strong>Garmento (AKA Dress Salesman)</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I became a very successful 'traveling' man, selling dresses on the road. Loved it. Wasn't home enough for the Princess to really dislike me. That dislike did come, with a passion, a little later. Our marriage lasted 27 years sustained by a white hot bond of anger. It's easy to stay hooked by being jointly and passionately pissed off at one another. Generates a lot of noise and action. One of first wife's favorite lines about me, told to anyone who would listen, was ""Bernie doesn't get ulcers. He gives them"".</p>
<p><strong>Iowa Hog &amp; Cattle Farmer</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I was a walking, farming, financial disaster. Always smelling like hog farmer shit. Most days the Princess made me take a shower as soon as I got home.

In the end, neither was the booze.</p>
<p><strong>Private U.S. Army</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">After I returned to my outfit from radio operator's school, I taught myself how to type and became a high speed radio operator and the second fastest dot/dit guy in the radio group. Lieutenant Hamlin then called me in his office to proudly tell me that he was going to put me in for PFC which came with a $4.00 a month pay raise (the base pay was $50 a month). I told the Lieutenant that I would pass the promotion. I was the ranking private in my barracks, a private longer than anybody else in the barracks and liked that distinction. So I told him to ""give the $4 a month to someone who needed it"".</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">That brilliant move really accelerated my application to get transferred to an outfit that was going overseas. Ah, the folly of youth. Hamlin couldn't wait to get rid of me, so I was sent as a high speed radio operator (with a high speed confrontational big mouth) to Ft. Lewis to join the 241st Signal Corps Group which was attached to the Sixth Army. The 241st was out of Boston consisting mostly of Boston Irish from Scollay Square. They were tough mothers who always wanted to beat the shit out of any Jew. But embarkation on the troop ship saw the end of that attitude. We also had a few homos, as gays were called in those days, and no one gave a fiddler's fuck. People who never served with gays don't know shit, only ignorant prejudice.</p>
<p><strong>Successful Stock Broker <span class=""notranslate"">(Simultaneously becoming a drunk.)</span></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I went looking for a job as a stock broker and got hired a few days later by a small time brokerage firm for a draw of $250 a month. The Princess cried the Mississippi River when I told her of my new profession, even as I 'guaranteed' her that I would be making at least $1,500 a month within 90 days. Being a fierce prospector, I bested that in very short order. In her defense, I never, ever consulted the Princess of my desire to get into the investment business because of her drive for a table-top smooth life. I have always tried to avoid pissing into the wind.</p>

<p>It's not cheap people. To really do it right it requires not only the cost for the publishing itself but all the book promotion hoopla that comes with it.

<p>A dear friend of Bernie's, Simon Murray, has been incredibly helpful in getting the book into a publisher's hand. If something comes of it, we'll be thrilled. But deals like that can take a long time to develop.</p>

<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>I'm Justin Harmon. For the past several months, I've been putting together a guide that I believe will help people follow their dreams, bring purpose and meaning to their lives, and maybe even change the world. </p>
<p>I've connected with and brought together a cast of some of the most amazing world changers and dreamers I know to help in spreading the messages for positive life change and the pursuit of purpose and fulfillment. </p>
<p>I believe that with a little inspirational &amp; motivational push, anyone can change their life and become a beacon of light for themselves and the rest of the world. This guide is that push. My fellow contributors are the beacon of light. And you are the key to changing the world. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Guide</h3>
<p>Change your Perception, Change your Life is a collection of essays written by myself and many other dreamers and world changers that talk about following dreams, changing the world, changing negative life perceptions, waking up from the status quo mindset, finding meaning, reaching fulfillment, and more. </p>

<p>As a young adult, I basically did everything I could to escape my life’s circumstances. I despised the notion of having to conform to the standards of life which surrounded me.

<p> </p></div>","The Vision
I'm Justin Harmon. For the past several months, I've been putting together a guide that I believe will help people follow their dreams, bring purpose and meaning to their lives, and maybe even change the world. 
I've connected with and brought together a cast of some of the most amazing world changers and dreamers I know to help in spreading the messages for positive life change and the pursuit of purpose and fulfillment. 
I believe that with a little inspirational & motivational push, anyone can change their life and become a beacon of light for themselves and the rest of the world. This guide is that push. My fellow contributors are the beacon of light. And you are the key to changing the world. 


The Guide
Change your Perception, Change your Life is a collection of essays written by myself and many other dreamers and world changers that talk about following dreams, changing the world, changing negative life perceptions, waking up from the status quo mindset, finding meaning, reaching fulfillment, and more. 

I'm raising money to help in publishing of this book. I want to bring this book to life and help it reach those who need it. Any excess funds will be used to help further spread the message for positive life change and fulfillment. 

Why? You Say.

<h1><strong>How to Not Lose Your Teen - Raising Kids who Love God and You Too!</strong></h1>
<p>We teach our kids about an enormous God—a God who shuts lion’s mouths, calms raging storms and speaks to us personally! But when they want to take a risk, we warn them of danger, afraid they’ll wreck their lives. God uses our struggles and mistakes to show us who He is… but parents don’t want to let their kids struggle or make mistakes. Though we say the most important thing is our faith, we often interact with our kids as if we don’t have any faith.</p>
<p>God taught me an enormous amount as we raised our own five teens, and through the teens I discipled and who lived with us. Witnessing the family dynamic up close, compassion welled up in me, and I wrote a book for parents of teens (and teens-to-be). People have told me it has transformed their families.</p>

<h3>Smart Swipe uses the stories from real college students as well as my own stories to explore college hookup culture. This book offers a venue for students to turn to if they are feeling shameful, guilty, and unsafe about hooking up in college.<br/><br/>My name is Valerie McPherson and I am the author of Smart Swipe . I wrote this book because I wanted to get people to start talking about sex in a positive way. More specifically I wanted to help college students become more self-aware and empowered if they were participating in the hookup culture surrounding them.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that college hookup culture is normal and that people shouldn’t be shamed for enjoying sexual pleasure. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for a sex positive culture in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you go about talking about sex or hooking up as a way to help you discover what you like physically and emotionally. But also ways to keep yourself safe and secured.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about college hookup culture and sexual empowerment and education:</h3>
<p>Common Sex - You will discover that most people who participated in college hookup culture shared a lot of similarities. A lot of students were nervous, excited and curious about this new freedom that they had. Most people were able to use this culture as part of this self-discovery about what they truly wanted in a future partner.</p>
<p>Female Empowerment - Women were able to neglect what they constantly heard in the media. They were able to take back their bodies and express openly that they too can enjoy sex. They too can be dominant. They too had a voice when it came to sex-related issues.</p>
<p>The Only Option - College Students go into college with these ideas and images of what it means to have fun in college. They watch movies about excessive drinking, partying and, of course, hooking up. So it’s no wonder that many of them go in believing that hookup culture is the only form of relationship they can have in college. In this section of the book, I pull from other researchers and their studies on hookup culture and why this mindset still continues to be popular.</p>You will love this book if you are an incoming college student, current college student, or anyone who has an interest in what it means to think positive about sex and hooking up.<br/><br/>Smart Swipe is a non-fiction book that speaks to college students and even parents who are looking at the phenomenon of sex on college campuses and so-called dating apps for the first time.<p>The Book - Smart Swipe</p>
<br/>The book is written in three parts....<br/><br/>Part one contains the introduction, the questions I asked the students I interviewed, the student’s perspectives on hookup culture, the personal stories from students, and what they all had in common. In this section you will develop a general view on what college hookup culture is for you, what it is for students and just how people are doing it. Women were generally feeling empowered, excited and ashamed. Men were feeling confident, active and pressured when it came to this culture.<br/><br/>Part two contains chapters five and six. I look more in depth into just how women are feeling empowered from hooking up. In this chapter, you see that women are taking their lives and bodies back and how they are trying to break down that sex double standard. You also learn just how we as a society have set up the sex double standard for men and women. This leads into Chapter 6, that focuses on the myth that hooking up is the only option in college.<br/><br/>Part three contains chapters seven and eight. I open up about why I participated in the hookup culture and just what I learned from it. Much like the other students interviewed, I felt shame and was scared to open up about my sex life. But after a while, I learned that I like being in control of my sexuality and feeling this rush. I also discuss how I developed new lingo and how I discovered apps that were somewhat addicting. This chapter spills into the reality chapter where I discuss the issues we are scared to talk about, whether this is being tested, becoming pregnant, and facing those double standards.<br/>It concludes with a final piece of advice for students who are thinking about or already participating in the college hookup culture.<p>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</p>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in February 2020.</p>
<p>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</p>
<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</p>
<p>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</p>
<p>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this [season of year]</p> When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<br/>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish<p>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</p>
<p>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</p>

<p>And more...</p>
<p><br/>About the Author</p>
<br/>Valerie McPherson is a current graduate student and research assistant studying Sociology at the University of West Georgia. Her hopes are to create conversations about sociological issues that are still having a major impact on people’s lives. As a sex positive feminist, Valerie McPherson wants to allow for individuals to become more open about talking about sex in order to drop the stigma that is associated with it. With these conversation she hopes to refine sex education in America. In regards to a career, she strives to become a Sociological Researcher, motivational speaker, and eventually obtain a PhD in Marriage and Family therapy to continue her journey on creating conversations we find hard to discuss.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I was very curious on how individuals, regardless of gender, were looking at their own hooking up experience. In addtion, I notice that apps such as Tinder, were having a major influence on how college students were interacting with one anohter. With that, I was about to discover that there was still some conversations needing to be held in order for individuals become more self-aware, whether this was emotionally or physically.<br/><br/>Smart Swipe does just that--it opens up the conversation on just how hookup culture started. It gives the dialogue between empowerment and sexual liberation. Finally, it offers the talk most people are forgetting and that is the reality that hookup culture can be beneficial but also harmful.<br/><br/>My passion for the subject truly began my senior year of undergrad. I was at a place in my life where I felt absolutely low and hated the way I looked and felt--to the point where I was contacted multiple times by an individual who called me a ‘whore’ or ‘slut’. I didn’t believe it, but it just made me sad to think that these words were being used on people who didn’t actually do anything wrong, they just wanted to enjoy themselves sexually.<br/><br/>I was always safe about sex, I got tested, I got myself out of situations when I knew I couldn’t commit to someone. But I realized a lot of peers were not doing the same. So I wanted to do something about. I want people to stop thinking that by hooking up with someone or using these apps, they weren’t a bad person, or even worse, a ‘slut’. It just meant that it was right for you at the time, as long as it was your choice. All I ever wanted in my life was to help people face their problems head-on, and one of the best ways is to start educating others about problems that people are facing and what they can do to help alleviate those issues.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Valerie McPherson at vmcpher1@my.westga.edu and on Instagram @valerie_mcpherson.<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p> Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<p>Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network.

In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for a sex positive culture in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you go about talking about sex or hooking up as a way to help you discover what you like physically and emotionally. But also ways to keep yourself safe and secured.In this book, you'll learn about college hookup culture and sexual empowerment and education:
Common Sex - You will discover that most people who participated in college hookup culture shared a lot of similarities. A lot of students were nervous, excited and curious about this new freedom that they had. Most people were able to use this culture as part of this self-discovery about what they truly wanted in a future partner.
Female Empowerment - Women were able to neglect what they constantly heard in the media. They were able to take back their bodies and express openly that they too can enjoy sex. They too can be dominant. They too had a voice when it came to sex-related issues.
The Only Option - College Students go into college with these ideas and images of what it means to have fun in college. They watch movies about excessive drinking, partying and, of course, hooking up. So it’s no wonder that many of them go in believing that hookup culture is the only form of relationship they can have in college. In this section of the book, I pull from other researchers and their studies on hookup culture and why this mindset still continues to be popular.You will love this book if you are an incoming college student, current college student, or anyone who has an interest in what it means to think positive about sex and hooking up.Smart Swipe is a non-fiction book that speaks to college students and even parents who are looking at the phenomenon of sex on college campuses and so-called dating apps for the first time.The Book - Smart Swipe
The book is written in three parts....Part one contains the introduction, the questions I asked the students I interviewed, the student’s perspectives on hookup culture, the personal stories from students, and what they all had in common. In this section you will develop a general view on what college hookup culture is for you, what it is for students and just how people are doing it. Women were generally feeling empowered, excited and ashamed. Men were feeling confident, active and pressured when it came to this culture.Part two contains chapters five and six. I look more in depth into just how women are feeling empowered from hooking up. In this chapter, you see that women are taking their lives and bodies back and how they are trying to break down that sex double standard. You also learn just how we as a society have set up the sex double standard for men and women. This leads into Chapter 6, that focuses on the myth that hooking up is the only option in college.Part three contains chapters seven and eight. I open up about why I participated in the hookup culture and just what I learned from it. Much like the other students interviewed, I felt shame and was scared to open up about my sex life. But after a while, I learned that I like being in control of my sexuality and feeling this rush. I also discuss how I developed new lingo and how I discovered apps that were somewhat addicting. This chapter spills into the reality chapter where I discuss the issues we are scared to talk about, whether this is being tested, becoming pregnant, and facing those double standards.It concludes with a final piece of advice for students who are thinking about or already participating in the college hookup culture.What I Need & What You'll Get

About the Author
Valerie McPherson is a current graduate student and research assistant studying Sociology at the University of West Georgia. Her hopes are to create conversations about sociological issues that are still having a major impact on people’s lives. As a sex positive feminist, Valerie McPherson wants to allow for individuals to become more open about talking about sex in order to drop the stigma that is associated with it. With these conversation she hopes to refine sex education in America. In regards to a career, she strives to become a Sociological Researcher, motivational speaker, and eventually obtain a PhD in Marriage and Family therapy to continue her journey on creating conversations we find hard to discuss.I wrote this book because I was very curious on how individuals, regardless of gender, were looking at their own hooking up experience. In addtion, I notice that apps such as Tinder, were having a major influence on how college students were interacting with one anohter. With that, I was about to discover that there was still some conversations needing to be held in order for individuals become more self-aware, whether this was emotionally or physically.Smart Swipe does just that--it opens up the conversation on just how hookup culture started. It gives the dialogue between empowerment and sexual liberation. Finally, it offers the talk most people are forgetting and that is the reality that hookup culture can be beneficial but also harmful.My passion for the subject truly began my senior year of undergrad. I was at a place in my life where I felt absolutely low and hated the way I looked and felt--to the point where I was contacted multiple times by an individual who called me a ‘whore’ or ‘slut’. I didn’t believe it, but it just made me sad to think that these words were being used on people who didn’t actually do anything wrong, they just wanted to enjoy themselves sexually.I was always safe about sex, I got tested, I got myself out of situations when I knew I couldn’t commit to someone. But I realized a lot of peers were not doing the same. So I wanted to do something about. I want people to stop thinking that by hooking up with someone or using these apps, they weren’t a bad person, or even worse, a ‘slut’. It just meant that it was right for you at the time, as long as it was your choice. All I ever wanted in my life was to help people face their problems head-on, and one of the best ways is to start educating others about problems that people are facing and what they can do to help alleviate those issues.For more information, you can connect with Valerie McPherson at vmcpher1@my.westga.edu and on Instagram @valerie_mcpherson.Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

Every single night it was the same question. It didn't matter if he was playing with his toys, watching TV or whatever else he may have been doing. Right around 9 pm he would ask me that question and he expected me to play his game. The <span>exchange would go like this: ""Do you know what time it is?"" Me: ""Time for you to get a job?"" Seth: ""No."" Me: ""Time for you to clean your room?"" Seth ""Noooo."" And we would continue back and forth until I responded with the correct ""Snuggle Time?"" And Seth would give a resounding ""YES"". Then he would climb up on my lap, snuggle up against his daddy and stay that way until he fell asleep. This happened every night. Snuggle time was the high light of my day and I believe it was Seth's as well. Snuggle time in our home meant hugs, kisses, and unconditional love. Snuggle time completed another day for us and allowed Seth to give and receive love, have a sense of security, and get the attention of his daddy to end his day. Snuggle time was pure. Snuggle time was open and honest. Snuggle time completed us. It didn't matter if I was reading, watching TV, browsing Facebook or anything else. When I heard ""Do you know what time it is?"" The world stopped so I could have snuggle time with my son. I no longer will get to hear that question. Snuggle time with Seth had come to an end but at least I experienced it. Some people drink alcohol, do drugs, or find another way to experience a high. Snuggle time replaced any need for that. There was no better high than holding that child in your arms and receiving his little hugs and kisses and hearing ""I love you daddy"" to finish your day. So I ask all of you, ""Do you know what time it is?"" It's a game that we all need to play more often. Maybe instead of play station the world replaced it with ""Do you know what time it is"" this world would be a better place. Maybe children would grow up with less hate in their heart. Maybe there would be less violence. Maybe there would be more kindness. Maybe we all would feel more fulfilled. Through all of this pain I at least can rest assured that Seth knew he was loved and I knew that I was loved in return. Both of us knew the answer before the question was asked. In our world it was always snuggle time. Now ask yourself, ""Do you know what time it is?""</span></p><div> </div><ul></ul><p><br/></p><div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funding is going to pay for the illustrator to help turn this story into a true children story.  We will complete the book and then self-publish.   If enough funds are raised we will even be making stuffed animals of ""SJ the Monkey"" so that children can snuggle up in bed with their very own SJ.   </p> <ul>

</div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p>This is not just another book project.  This is a complete movement designed to impact the world.  Seth's Snuggle Time story came about because of a young child's death and a father's desire to not let hat death be in vain.  Seth touched many people while he was alive with his love and zest for life and now he is touching many more through death.  Join us as we attempt to change the world - one child at a time.</p><div> </div><ul></ul><p><br/></p><ul></ul><div>

<p>We have already changed the way people around us view the world.  We have received many emails on line from people who read the snuggle time story and felt compelled to share with us how it moved them to change.  If we are changing people with the story already imagine what the right children's book could do!  How much risk is there if we can make the world better for children by reminding parents everywhere to slow down, value the time they have and focus on their children each day?  We are not promised tomorrow on this earth so value the time we have.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Not everyone can financially support the many causes out there and we realize that.  However, you can still spread the message for us.  Share the Snuggle Time story.  Tell everyone who will listen about our situation and how we truly want to make a difference in this world by encouraging others to snuggle and love their children.  </p>
<p>Even if you don't have a child at home anymore I'm sure you know people who do.  Maybe they need to be reminded because life is fast-paced these days and most of us never meant to be too busy.  Maybe you are the only one who can help them see it before it's too late.  Seth's Snuggle Time - a message of love.  Join us by spreading the word!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Professional editing costs money. Professional formatting costs money. Professional cover design? Money. I need this book to be as good as it can be, and I'm not currently in a position to invest that money ahead of time. This campaign allows me to fund that important work by pre-selling copies of the book, and then use the funds raised to ensure the book is presented to a standard I feel proud of.</p>
<p>For that reason, I have made this an<strong> all or nothing campaign.</strong> That means the project will only go ahead if I raise enough money to ensure that the editing, book production and shipping can be completed (including calculating in-site and transaction fees).</p>
<p>So, that's why I'm making this project a crowdfunded one. What do you get in return for your support? Well, most obviously, you'll get a copy of the book - in the case of the physical editions, signed copies. There are also exclusive-to-this-campaign perks where you can request me to record a reading of your favourite My Life In Horror column or short story. See FAQs for more.</p>
<p>There will also be two different limited hardback editions of the book, both of which will <strong>only be available via this campaign. </strong>These editions will both feature covers exclusive to this campaign and will be <strong>individually numbered and signed</strong>. The <strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>(limited to 26 copies, lettered and signed) will also contain an <strong>exclusive essay.</strong> This essay will only ever be published as part of this edition of this book.</p>
<p>So, you'll get My Life In Volume 1, signed and/or in a format unique to this campaign. You'll also get a warm glow from knowing you helped me get this book out into the world in the best shape I could.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579738185/l8ztjsyxt2sp89ib3gfk.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is not my first self-publishing rodeo. I have successfully self-published my debut short story collection <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B076JF5K13"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A WARNING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE ENSLAVEMENT THAT YOU WILL DISMISS AS A COLLECTION OF SHORT FICTION AND ESSAYS BY KIT POWER. </a></p>
<p>Prior to starting this campaign, I approached several editors I have worked with before for quotes. All have been advised of the timescale and confirmed they can work within it safely. The person who will be formatting and creating the covers has also confirmed they'll be available to do the work within the timescale. In each case, I also have an alternate who is also available.</p>
<p>That said, the two biggest risks are that either those timescales slip or I have miscalculated the costs. </p>
<p>In the first case, I will be transparent about any such issues as and when they arise and will keep you fully appraised of the production process following the close of the campaign. I don't anticipate any issues here - for my part, the text is fully assembled and ready to go to the editor the second the campaign successfully concludes.</p>
<p>In the second case, the main x-factor is the transaction fees from the site itself. Having spoken to other people who have run this kind of campaign, they've advised that those fees end up taking out around 15% of the total figure (and that doesn't include the separate 5% the site itself takes or the £50 flat fee). That transaction figure can vary, though, depending on the number of small backers, as it has a 'floor' of 30p + 3%. What this means is that if this project funds entirely through e-book purchases, say, those transaction fees would be higher than 15% (though in that case, the project would still fund comfortably).</p>
<p>The pre-production costs are known, and the physical productions costs and postage I have estimated carefully. Should I turn out to have miscalculated on either, I will swallow any additional costs in order to complete the production and get you your books. I don't expect to make much (if any) money off this project, but I am confident that if it funds, I will be able to fulfil it, out of pocket if necessary. That's why I've set it as an all-or-nothing campaign, and why the figure to raise is £1100.</p>
<p>If the project funds, barring an act of God, the book is going to happen.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A project like this will live or die by word of mouth. If you've enjoyed <a href=""https://www.gingernutsofhorror.com/my-life-in-horror.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Life In Horror,</a> whether or not you can contribute financially, you can absolutely help make this happen in a number of ways:</p>
<p>Tell people about the project - Tweet or post a link to Facebook. Tell people why you dig MLiH, and why you think this'll be worth their while.</p>
<p>If you have a blog, plug it there (and if you want me to provide some text, drop me a message).</p>
<p>If you have a podcast, mention it there - again, every avenue that helps get the word out helps the project (and if you do this, drop me a link so I can signal boost).</p>
<p>If you're a part of any Facebook or Goodreads group that might enjoy the book, share the link and let them know.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to check out this project, and for your support in making it happen.</p>

I am incredibly proud of this book and want to ensure it's published to a professional standard, with thorough editing, clean formatting, and a good looking cover.
And I can only do it with your help.

 
What I Need & What You Get
Professional editing costs money. Professional formatting costs money. Professional cover design? Money. I need this book to be as good as it can be, and I'm not currently in a position to invest that money ahead of time. This campaign allows me to fund that important work by pre-selling copies of the book, and then use the funds raised to ensure the book is presented to a standard I feel proud of.
For that reason, I have made this an all or nothing campaign. That means the project will only go ahead if I raise enough money to ensure that the editing, book production and shipping can be completed (including calculating in-site and transaction fees).
So, that's why I'm making this project a crowdfunded one. What do you get in return for your support? Well, most obviously, you'll get a copy of the book - in the case of the physical editions, signed copies. There are also exclusive-to-this-campaign perks where you can request me to record a reading of your favourite My Life In Horror column or short story. See FAQs for more.
There will also be two different limited hardback editions of the book, both of which will only be available via this campaign. These editions will both feature covers exclusive to this campaign and will be individually numbered and signed. The Deluxe Edition (limited to 26 copies, lettered and signed) will also contain an exclusive essay. This essay will only ever be published as part of this edition of this book.
So, you'll get My Life In Volume 1, signed and/or in a format unique to this campaign. You'll also get a warm glow from knowing you helped me get this book out into the world in the best shape I could.
 Risks & Challenges
This is not my first self-publishing rodeo. I have successfully self-published my debut short story collection A WARNING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE ENSLAVEMENT THAT YOU WILL DISMISS AS A COLLECTION OF SHORT FICTION AND ESSAYS BY KIT POWER. 
Prior to starting this campaign, I approached several editors I have worked with before for quotes. All have been advised of the timescale and confirmed they can work within it safely. The person who will be formatting and creating the covers has also confirmed they'll be available to do the work within the timescale. In each case, I also have an alternate who is also available.
That said, the two biggest risks are that either those timescales slip or I have miscalculated the costs. 
In the first case, I will be transparent about any such issues as and when they arise and will keep you fully appraised of the production process following the close of the campaign. I don't anticipate any issues here - for my part, the text is fully assembled and ready to go to the editor the second the campaign successfully concludes.
In the second case, the main x-factor is the transaction fees from the site itself. Having spoken to other people who have run this kind of campaign, they've advised that those fees end up taking out around 15% of the total figure (and that doesn't include the separate 5% the site itself takes or the £50 flat fee). That transaction figure can vary, though, depending on the number of small backers, as it has a 'floor' of 30p + 3%. What this means is that if this project funds entirely through e-book purchases, say, those transaction fees would be higher than 15% (though in that case, the project would still fund comfortably).
The pre-production costs are known, and the physical productions costs and postage I have estimated carefully. Should I turn out to have miscalculated on either, I will swallow any additional costs in order to complete the production and get you your books. I don't expect to make much (if any) money off this project, but I am confident that if it funds, I will be able to fulfil it, out of pocket if necessary. That's why I've set it as an all-or-nothing campaign, and why the figure to raise is £1100.
If the project funds, barring an act of God, the book is going to happen.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
A project like this will live or die by word of mouth. If you've enjoyed My Life In Horror, whether or not you can contribute financially, you can absolutely help make this happen in a number of ways:
Tell people about the project - Tweet or post a link to Facebook. Tell people why you dig MLiH, and why you think this'll be worth their while.
If you have a blog, plug it there (and if you want me to provide some text, drop me a message).
If you have a podcast, mention it there - again, every avenue that helps get the word out helps the project (and if you do this, drop me a link so I can signal boost).
If you're a part of any Facebook or Goodreads group that might enjoy the book, share the link and let them know.
Thank you for taking the time to check out this project, and for your support in making it happen.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

My vampires don’t sparkle in the sun, but the genre has continued to develop a massive fan base with the ever increasing popularity of <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>, <i>Supernatural</i>, and <i>Being Human</i> among other television shows. The literary world has mirrored that hunger by releasing dozens of new novels related to the genre. Ironically, I wrote this book before it was such a hit and I wrote it because I wanted to see the genre take a new direction. The series will feature an entirely new species that will change the way we look at the genre. It was intended to appeal to the audiences with its heavy tilt towards romance while maintaining much of the old ways we think of vampires: think Anne Rice and <i>Interview with a Vampire</i>. But it also pushes the genre to think in a new direction all together, by blending the two once hardened worlds into one cohesive existence. It breaks stereotypes and barriers of the vampire versus werewolf world in a way that’s never been done before and that will have an epic impact on the genre. Become a part of the phenomenon before it hits a massive scale, and you can say that “I helped make that book possible!” <br/> </p><p><strong>FUTURE</strong> <strong>MOTION</strong> <strong>PICTURE</strong> - Becoming a backer now helps me pave the way to a major motion picture. There will be scripts, yes as in movie scripts, written between 2014 and 2015, and I’m already making connections with Hollywood to find the right director, producer and film company. I need your contribution now so that I can continue to grow these relationships and see this massive project fully realized. I also have limited production merchandise in the works based on the book for all those fans out there that just can’t get enough. <br/> </p><p><strong>RESPONSIBLE</strong> <strong>PUBLISHING</strong> - Finally, as a backer, you’ll be helping me set an example of responsible publishing for the next generation. Traditional full-scale publishing avenues are cost efficient but not necessarily environmentally responsible. It’s sad, but so many of the books end of in our land fill. I am outsourcing and teaming up with Ingram Spark and their on-demand printing abilities. This greatly reduces the number of books and paper that go to waste since the books are only printed once they are ordered. In addition, Ingram Spark now has the ability to print on SFI certified, acid-free, crème paper instead of the industry white. That means more responsible use of the materials used when printing the book. This avenue isn’t the cheapest route, but I felt like this was the perfect opportunity to set an example for responsible book publishing. As a result, your contribution means that much more and you will be a part of the positive environmental impact. </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>If you aren’t in a position to contribute, no worries… that doesn’t mean you can’t<br/>help.</p><ul>

<h3><b>ABOUT CANVAS </b></h3>
<p>The Centre for Applied Nonviolent Actions and Strategies is
a Belgrade, Serbia -based activist group that seeks to educate civil resistors
all over the world about strategic nonviolence. 
It was founded by the members of the Serbian nonviolent resistance group
Otpor (resistance!) that helped to bring down dictator Slobodan Milosevic in
the year 2000. Since then CANVAS has been involved in hundreds of youth
movements in central Europe and the middle east. Some of the groups that have
learned and applied CANVAS methods directly include Egypt’s April 6th movement
(2011), Georgia’s Kmara! Movement, Sudan’s Girifna movement, Ukraine’s Orange
Revolution participants  and Russia’s
Oborona  movement. CANVAS trainers have
worked with people in over 40 countries, and participated in  over 200 workshops or conferences and trained
over 2000 participants. The CANVAS workshop model is based around the ideas of
unity, planning and nonviolent discipline and seeks to bring about the transfer
of knowledge about nonviolent strategies from the people who have successfully
implemented it themselves. </p>
<p>CANVAS members have been featured in multiple documentaries
including the Peabody award winning <i>Bringing Down a Dictator</i>, and the movie <i>How
to Start a Revolution</i>.</p>
<p>In 2006 CANVAS published an activist textbook entitled
<i>Nonviolent Struggle: 50 Crucial Points</i> that has since been translated into five
languages and downloaded over 17,000 times by nonviolent resistors all around
the world. <i>Making Oppression Backfire</i> is envisioned to be another booklet for
activists, with updated case studies and exercises. </p>

Pero - Kenan's beloved karate coach - showed up at his door with an AK-47 - screaming: ""You have one hour to leave or be killed!"" Kenan’s only crime: he was Muslim.

After two decades in the United States, Kenan honors his father’s wish to visit their homeland, making a list of what he wants to do there.

<h2>***</h2>
<h2>My story</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm <a href=""http://whatsupsmiley.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smiley</a>. I’m a writer and a lover of life. A year ago, the voice inside my head telling me to listen to my heart and take a leap, finally got loud enough that I couldn’t ignore it. So I quit my comfortable, government job in D.C. and moved to San Francisco with nothing but two suitcases, my newfound optimism, and a lot of energy. This book is about that journey. </p>
<p>I’m sharing my story about coming alive and learning how to make a lasting impact in others’ lives at the age of 30—for you, because no one can have a quarter-life breakthrough alone. By contributing to this project, you’ll not only get a beautiful book that will help you figure out your next steps, but most importantly: you’ll become part of a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheQuarterLifeBreakthrough"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">community</a> of like-minded people that will help support you in achieving your own breakthroughs.</p>
<h2>Why write this book?</h2>
<p>For starters, it’s not easy to find a job. In 2011, according to <em>The New York Times</em>, over 25% of Americans aged 25-34 were not working. But this doesn’t mean Millennials are lazy—quite the opposite, actually. We want to work, but we want work that is connected to our values. Some of us care so deeply about aligning our jobs with ourselves that we are willing to change careers multiple times, take pay cuts, take unpaid internships, even move back home with our parents, all while we figure out our next step. </p>
<p>But figuring out that next step can be really hard. After I started writing about my breakthrough on <a href=""http://whatsupsmiley.com/2012/08/08/you-have-to-start-somewhere-so-how-about-right-now/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my blog</a>, I realized readers were struggling with the same things I was. I knew I had to develop my ideas into an actual book. </p>
<p>So I’m writing a book about what has worked in my own search for meaningful work. It’s a book about finding a way to make a living, working hard, doing something you love. I believe it’s unacceptable that half of Americans are unsatisfied with their jobs, and this book is for everyone who feels the same way.  </p>
<p><strong>This book is for everyone who believes the <em>quarter-life crisis</em> shouldn’t be a crisis, but a breakthrough, a moment of empowerment and opportunity.</strong></p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://whatsupsmiley.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/the-quarter-life-breakthrough-cover-final.jpg?w=490&amp;h=686"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h2>How is this book unique?</h2>
<p>The book will feature beautiful illustrations, goal-mapping worksheets, career transition resources, and writing prompts, all designed so you can have your own breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>More than just a book, <em>The Quarter-Life Breakthrough</em> is about creating a community of people who refuse to settle for mediocrity.</strong></p>
<p>This book is the companion I wish I had during my own quarter-life breakthrough.</p>
<p>It’s approachable and easy-to-read, featuring personal stories from an actual twentysomething (okay, okay, thirtysomething as of June 29). This is not a 300-page self-help book written by some grey-haired Ph.D from Harvard studying twentysomethings like lab rats.</p>

<h2>Why are you the right person to write this book?</h2>
<div>In the eight years since college, I’ve lived in five different cities on two continents, had seven different jobs, moved back home with my parents twice, and started down three different “career paths,” so I know a thing or two about making life transitions (and freaking out).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Leaving my job at the Peace Corps in Washington, D.C. (an incredible organization made up of people who are changing the world), was the scariest thing I ever did—but embarking on a career that makes my heart sing has changed my life and made me come alive as a person and a writer. I started my own blog, got <a href=""http://whatsupsmiley.com/writing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">published</a> in <em>Forbes</em>, <em>The Huffington Post</em>, <em>The Hairpin</em>, and <em>Thought Catalog</em>, among others.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As academy director of <a href=""http://www.boldacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Bold Academy</a>, I facilitate transformative experiences to empower young professionals to have quarter-life breakthroughs and realize their full potential. In my free time, I surround myself with communities of people who believe in the beauty of their dreams. I’m a mentor for the StartingBloc Institute for Social Innovation and the Dell Social Innovation Lab, which means I’ve had the opportunity to learn from numerous young entrepreneurs who are making an impact by pursuing meaningful work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went to Wesleyan University—and despite the fact that I majored in film and don’t work in the film industry, and that I spent an estimated $10,254 on an Intro to Dance class senior year—I still maintain that a liberal arts degree was worth it (although I wish it had been cheaper).
<h2>Why do you need $9,000?</h2>
<div>
<p>While writing a book is free, actually publishing a book is rather expensive. I'm paying artists and experts at professional rates to make sure this book is the best it can be, and to ensure as many people as possible end up reading it. Contributing to this project goes directly towards my estimated production costs including: developmental editing and copy editing ($2500), cover art, book design, photography, and illustrations ($2000), book marketing and publicity ($2500), campaign video and promotion ($1000), campaign shipping and fulfillment ($500), and printing costs for the first run of the book ($500).  </p>
<p>Check out the great perks for contributors including the e-Book and signed paperback copies of the book, a hand-designed letterpress poster, virtual pep talks, and in-person coaching.</p>
<h2><strong>Why do you have a stretch goal of $12,000?</strong></h2>
<div><strong>Thanks to your overwhelming support, we sold over 300 books and hit our $9,000 goal in 2 weeks! Help us sell 500 books, and receive amazing perks available exclusively to Indiegogo contributors.</strong></div>
<div>Your contributions will go towards:</div>
<p>1) The cost of printing more books</p>
<p>2) A marketing campaign so the book reaches a wider audience </p>
<p>3) Building an engaged community of <em>The Quarter-Life Breakthrough</em> readers who refuse to settle for mediocrity. An online platform so readers can connect and share their stories; what's worked for them in their search for meaningful work, and what their needs are—as well as a book tour which will feature in-person readings and discussion groups throughout the U.S.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Can you really have a ""quarter-life"" breakthrough at the age of 30?</h2>
<p>Yes. I believe it’s never too late to make a change if you need to make one. I may not live to 120, but I've had breakthroughs at the age of 25, 28, and 30—and I hope to continue to have breakthroughs for the rest of my life. I don't know the exact age that the ""quarter-life"" breakthrough becomes the ""mid-life"" breakthrough, but I'll let you know when I find out—that will be part of the sequel.  </p>
<h2>When will I get the book?</h2>
<p><span>I’ve made great progress on <em>The Quarter-Life Breakthrough</em> so far; I have a working first draft, and recently started the second draft. The writing process, not to mention the publishing process, moves slowly, and can sometimes take just as long as finding a new job. Having said that, my goal is to be finished with the book and have it shipped to you by Christmas 2013. This date may be pushed back due to the nature of the publishing process, but my promise is that I will update contributors on my progress and the anticipated ship date.</span></p>
<h2>Gratitude</h2>
<p>I cannot express how grateful I am to you for reading these words and becoming part of this community, and to my family and friends, throughout the country and around the world, who have made this project possible through their love and support over the past 30 years—thank you for everything.</p>

How to have breakthroughs in other aspects of your life, not related to ""what you do""


When to take a dancing timeout and blast Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own” (ie, right now)

Why are you the right person to write this book?
In the eight years since college, I’ve lived in five different cities on two continents, had seven different jobs, moved back home with my parents twice, and started down three different “career paths,” so I know a thing or two about making life transitions (and freaking out).
 
Leaving my job at the Peace Corps in Washington, D.C. (an incredible organization made up of people who are changing the world), was the scariest thing I ever did—but embarking on a career that makes my heart sing has changed my life and made me come alive as a person and a writer. I started my own blog, got published in Forbes, The Huffington Post, The Hairpin, and Thought Catalog, among others.
 
As academy director of The Bold Academy, I facilitate transformative experiences to empower young professionals to have quarter-life breakthroughs and realize their full potential. In my free time, I surround myself with communities of people who believe in the beauty of their dreams. I’m a mentor for the StartingBloc Institute for Social Innovation and the Dell Social Innovation Lab, which means I’ve had the opportunity to learn from numerous young entrepreneurs who are making an impact by pursuing meaningful work.
 
I went to Wesleyan University—and despite the fact that I majored in film and don’t work in the film industry, and that I spent an estimated $10,254 on an Intro to Dance class senior year—I still maintain that a liberal arts degree was worth it (although I wish it had been cheaper).
Why do you need $9,000?

While writing a book is free, actually publishing a book is rather expensive. I'm paying artists and experts at professional rates to make sure this book is the best it can be, and to ensure as many people as possible end up reading it. Contributing to this project goes directly towards my estimated production costs including: developmental editing and copy editing ($2500), cover art, book design, photography, and illustrations ($2000), book marketing and publicity ($2500), campaign video and promotion ($1000), campaign shipping and fulfillment ($500), and printing costs for the first run of the book ($500).  
Check out the great perks for contributors including the e-Book and signed paperback copies of the book, a hand-designed letterpress poster, virtual pep talks, and in-person coaching.
Why do you have a stretch goal of $12,000?
Thanks to your overwhelming support, we sold over 300 books and hit our $9,000 goal in 2 weeks! Help us sell 500 books, and receive amazing perks available exclusively to Indiegogo contributors.
Your contributions will go towards:
1) The cost of printing more books
2) A marketing campaign so the book reaches a wider audience 
3) Building an engaged community of The Quarter-Life Breakthrough readers who refuse to settle for mediocrity. An online platform so readers can connect and share their stories; what's worked for them in their search for meaningful work, and what their needs are—as well as a book tour which will feature in-person readings and discussion groups throughout the U.S.


Can you really have a ""quarter-life"" breakthrough at the age of 30?
Yes. I believe it’s never too late to make a change if you need to make one. I may not live to 120, but I've had breakthroughs at the age of 25, 28, and 30—and I hope to continue to have breakthroughs for the rest of my life. I don't know the exact age that the ""quarter-life"" breakthrough becomes the ""mid-life"" breakthrough, but I'll let you know when I find out—that will be part of the sequel.  
When will I get the book?
I’ve made great progress on The Quarter-Life Breakthrough so far; I have a working first draft, and recently started the second draft. The writing process, not to mention the publishing process, moves slowly, and can sometimes take just as long as finding a new job. Having said that, my goal is to be finished with the book and have it shipped to you by Christmas 2013. This date may be pushed back due to the nature of the publishing process, but my promise is that I will update contributors on my progress and the anticipated ship date.
Gratitude
I cannot express how grateful I am to you for reading these words and becoming part of this community, and to my family and friends, throughout the country and around the world, who have made this project possible through their love and support over the past 30 years—thank you for everything.
I would also like to acknowledge the incredibly talented artists and changemakers who have worked hard to make this project come to life. These people include: Caroline Kessler (editor), Kara Brodgesell (video and cover photography), Bernat Fortet (cover designer), Nick Baranowski (letterpress art and prints), Guy Fox (music), as well as Sydney Malawer (chief crowdfunding advisor), Sonia Chokshi (social media specialist), Nate Bagley (project advisor), Ben Tseitlin (project advisor), Jeremy Kauffman (project assistant) and Becca Poswolsky (my sister and life coach).
Please share this campaign on Email, Facebook, and Twitter.

<p>Eureka Results is a field guide for creative entrepreneurs who have amazing ideas but are struggling with shiny object syndrome or discouragement as they build their businesses. It’s about why systems are so powerful, how they work, and how anyone can wield them as a tool to protect what matters and to get things done.<br/><br/>My name is Ashlee Berghoff and I am the author of Eureka Results: How Entrepreneurs Can Turn Their Best Ideas Into Reality. I wrote this book because <strong>I believe that systems are one of the most underestimated but powerful tools in our arsenal as entrepreneurs. </strong>Too many of us are searching for THE answer - the one magic bullet that will make everything fall into place. In reality, taking action on a big vision is a marathon...and systems are your shoes and water bottle to help you make it to the finish line.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover practical tools and a powerful mindset you can use to transform your business using systems, especially if systems don’t come easily to you. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for systems. Ultimately, <strong>I want you to see this book as a tool to help you experience focus, momentum, and the joy of seeing your vision come to life.</strong><br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the main types of systems, the mindset of a powerful implementer, and the five core systems every business owner needs. You'll hear insights such as...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to embrace iterative problem solving in your business</p></li>
<li><p>How to use systems to go from an 80-hour work week to a 20-hour work week</p></li>
<li><p>How simple questions can help you build a business around the lifestyle that is most meaningful to you</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you know you should build some structure into your business but aren’t sure how, struggle to finish the projects you start, or feel like other entrepreneurs are magically better at all of this than you are.<br/><br/>Eureka Results is a nonfiction book that speaks to entrepreneurs and small business owners who want to look at creativity and systems in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Eureka Results</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and chapters 1-6. In this section, I'll show you how lightbulb moments and determination aren't enough to help you go the distance as an entrepreneur. You also need to know how to wield one of the most powerful and underestimated forces in your business - your systems. I'll explain how you're using systems constantly, even if you can't see them, and how understanding your systems is a big step towards turning your best ideas into reality.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 7-10. In this section, I'll show you how the journey from eureka moment (those lightbulb moments we all love so much) to eureka results (seeing our vision actually come to life) is a marathon, not a sprint. Before we can use systems effectively to get all the way to the finish line, we need to set fair expectations for ourselves, embrace living in the messy middle, and cultivate an ongoing mindset of experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters 11-15 and the conclusion. This section is a field guide and will walk you through a step-by-step process of creating five core systems in your business. These core systems will help you focus on what matters, eliminate shiny object syndrome and decision fatigue, help you see the progress you're making, and become the confident leader of a rock star team. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and e-book. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>

The Chipmunk is an online periodical showcasing fiction, artwork, poetry, photography and other creative work by and for Lincoln residents. This project would not have been possible without months of work by our software developer to design a customized Lincoln Chipmunk website and then link it with the Squirrel's database of subscribers and customized software. <strong>The final cost was about $8,000</strong>, so I’m asking for your help in defraying $5,000 of this cost.</p><p>This fundraising campaign will run for 30 days. If donations exceed the $5,000 goal during that time, any further donations will be applied to the rest of the cost of creating the Chipmunk and then (if more than $8,000 is donated) towards future expenses, including technical troubleshooting and keeping the software current.</p><p>The Lincoln Squirrel/Chipmunk is not an incorporated nonprofit so I’m afraid I can’t offer you a tax deduction — but there are other perks.

The Chipmunk is an online periodical showcasing fiction, artwork, poetry, photography and other creative work by and for Lincoln residents. This project would not have been possible without months of work by our software developer to design a customized Lincoln Chipmunk website and then link it with the Squirrel's database of subscribers and customized software. The final cost was about $8,000, so I’m asking for your help in defraying $5,000 of this cost.This fundraising campaign will run for 30 days. If donations exceed the $5,000 goal during that time, any further donations will be applied to the rest of the cost of creating the Chipmunk and then (if more than $8,000 is donated) towards future expenses, including technical troubleshooting and keeping the software current.The Lincoln Squirrel/Chipmunk is not an incorporated nonprofit so I’m afraid I can’t offer you a tax deduction — but there are other perks. You’ll get a free gift of Lincoln Squirrel/Lincoln Chipmunk merchandise to enjoy and stimulate conversation among friends and family: 

Seedling level (bronze) — Get a magnet, sticker, or a set of three postcards when you donate at least $50.

Acorn level (silver) — Receive a cotton tote bag, coffee mug, face mask, or a set of four coasters when you donate at least $75.

Pumpkin level (gold) — Choose from a T-shirt, metal travel mug, or drawstring bag when you donate at least $100.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Right the Reset is a story about a trio of new friends who go on a mission to protect their way of life when higher powers threaten to destroy everything they've ever worked for. On a continent recovering from twenty years of plague, political upheaval, and lost individualism, their task grows from something as small as passing along a message to something as large as reviving the broken human spirit. Their target: the education system.<br/><br/>My name is Ania Luckiewicz and I am the author of Right the Reset. I wrote this book because I wanted to talk about the concept of mastery learning versus learning for test scores, in a way that is fun and engaging. As it stands, students are getting left behind and disassociating from academia when they are not given enough support to push through a tough lesson. Why do we normalize going through school with C's and D's? Why even B's? How can you build on top of an unstable foundation? I believe that today's society has the technology and the tools to totally reimagine the education system, but it needs a push to pursue something so new.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that a change in how we learn is not only necessary, but realistic. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with ideas of education reform, tackle questions of human relevance and vulnerability, and escape into a thrilling fiction adventure that will leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>The year is 2048. Katie Luczynski, Merritt Campbell-Gibbs, and Raegen Cregar are students at Ivory College, a growing institution off the coast of the notorious American Partition. Though not initially the best of friends, these three girls find themselves entangled in a plot to shut down their school and disestablish their island as an independent power. Seemingly unprepared for the task, they're asked to travel to the Partition, face down corrupt leaders, and prove a man's innocence to an alien people wracked with grief and anger. Challenged by the aftereffects of the First Plague, the Superbugs, and the Anthroviroid, the protagonists have to work together to show the world a path to a more fulfilling life. But when secret identities threaten to break the bonds holding them together, can Katie, Merritt, and Raegen trust each other enough to thwart an enemy bigger than anything they had imagined? Can reformed education really be the key to opposing a deadly, foreign Partition?<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy escaping into dystopian and sci-fi narratives. This novel is meant to grab and keep your attention, while making you sit back on your haunches and think a little. Whether you excelled in school or slaved through that part of your life, I think we can all agree that areas exist that we should handle better. If you like authors like Dan Brown, Ruta Sepetys, or Max Brooks, this book will be the next best thing to add to your shelf.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Right the Reset inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>What did I gain from my own education?</li>
<li>Where are we going as a society?</li>
<li>How can we do better?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. In times where we are continually pressed for time and overwhelmed by constant media, I believe discussing pressing current issues through a popular fiction storyline is one of the best methods of conveying a message. With <i>Right the Reset</i>, I hope that the plight of the characters generate strong feelings of love, friendship, and inspiration to change us all for the better.</p>

They must settle their differences and come together to escape and find freedom. Sirien, Amalie and Davina were born to a common farmer and his wife, the daughter of the head Elder of the Tribe Nasinreth. Born with blood blessings, the blessed hold power to heal, see the future, have natural insight for politics and leadership or have strength and stamina in skills of fighting and defense. The sisters keep their blessings secret, hidden not only from the world, but from each other in order to survive the Kings deadly rule until the day they can no longer hide and must flee the Capital City into exile.<br/><br/>My name is Lou Hobbs, and I am the author of So Called Traitors.

After years of hostility with countries all over the world, the King seeks new alliances and trade routes to fund his indefinite search for the tribal people of the Nasinreth. Magic is outlawed and has been for over twenty year, and those to be found to posses it is sentenced to death.<br/><br/>The Nasinreth were once highly valuable to the King and his kingdom. Known as a gentle people, they served the crown wholeheartedly. It all came to an end however when the prophecy by the Kings own Visionary came to light. “The first heir will be the downfall of the kingdom, the second heir will unite the people and the third will bring glory.” After years of his fathers attempts to replace him, Agnai grew cold to the Nasinreth, and once crowned vowed to destroy them.<br/><br/>Aldhorran is the Capital city of Omideon where the three sisters reside.

Her birth ended her mothers life, and the irony is she is a healer.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<i>How Games Get Made: The Stories of the People Who Make and Play the Games We Love</i><br/><br/>This book follows the lives of many types of individuals in the gaming industry— from CEOs and artists, to the programmers and streamers— in order to explore how the game development industry functions. It features interviews with several well-known game development industry veterans, such as Feargus Urquhart and David Cage.<br/><br/>My name is Emma Schaale and I am the author of <i>How Games Get Made</i>. I wrote this book because I’m a game development student myself, and I’ve often worried about job propsects in the future— do I want to pursue working at a large company, or do I want to start my own company? I wanted help in answering these questions, and who better to ask than the successful who made those same decisions themselves?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will also discover useful advice and context about decisions that other game developers made when fleshing out their career path.

I want you to see this book as inspiration to help you get into the industry, or learn more about the decisions and sacrifices that people make to work in it.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about business decisions and personal sacrifice:<ul>
<li>How Sean Baptiste, Influencer Manager at Bethesda, overcame a life-threatening medical diagnosis right out of theater college to become somebody who works with the Internet’s most famous personalities to advertise Bethesda’s games.</li>
<li>How David Cage, CEO of Quantic Dream, went from sleeping under his own desk and paying a handful of friends out of his own pocket to becoming the CEO of a 200-person game studio.</li>
<li>How Feargus Urquhart, CEO of Obsidian Entertainment, went from dropping out of a bio-engineering degree a semester before completion to becoming the father of the beloved <i>Fallout</i> (1997-) series.</li>

<h3>Blurb for Book 3</h3>
<p><i>When disease ravages Earth’s cacao plantations, Bo Benitez returns home to help with the media spin to hide that chocolate is in danger of being lost forever.  HGB has come up with a new product – one which doesn’t appease the cocoa-addicted murderous, shark-toothed aliens threatening to invade the planet.  Someone has to smooth things out.  Just when Bo starts to make headway, someone tries to kidnap her.  While trying to avoid more would-be-kidnappers, Bo finds out that HGB is developing a cure for withdrawal from the Invincible Heart.  Will she let her need to be physically whole again tie her to HGB and its enigmatic CEO? When she gets a key piece of evidence that would unravel secrets from three different planets, she has tough choices to make about the future of her world and its place in the galaxy.</i></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign  is for the publication of Book 3 in the Chocoverse series.  Though I definitely have more stories to tell in the 'verse, this book wraps up the invasion story plot introduced in the first book, and lets you see where Bo winds up in relation to her world.  The first two books have gained a small but passionate following (Chestla, in particular has her own fans, and you should have seen the reaction when I threatened to kill off another secondary character in Book 2).  Mi amigos, you deserve an ending to the trilogy.  If you're currently at the cliff hanger at the end of Pure Chocolate -- I feel you.  You trusted me.  I wouldn't end with that.</p>
<p>I personally believe this series is important because it shows a Latina protag (loosely based on a conglomeration of several of my close friends) in the lead role in a science fiction series.  It is a homage to the cheesiness of the telenovela tradition, complete with all the heart and optimism that implies.  There's a lot in the series  about overcoming prejudice and finding family inside blended cultures and backgrounds.  The messages of love, mercy, and hope run through all three books, summed up by Tawny's media campaign centered around the slogan <i>Mercy Is a Gift</i>.  </p>
<p>And yes, mercy is a gift.  Pero . . . money is a gift, too.  I have a hard time asking for this, but I need help if I'm going to make this book available to readers.  I've already written Fake Chocolate.  What I need from you guys is support for professional quality cover art, a thorough edit (because, seriously, it's nearly impossible to catch all the places where Tyson can't say TH all by myself), and all of the production stages that get a book into the hands of readers.  There's a lot that goes into this.  The font with the swooping c-s alone is going to cost roughly $200.</p>
<p>A lot of you visiting this probably know me.  But if you don't, here's my bio:  Amber Royer writes the CHOCOVERSE comic telenovela-style foodie-inspired space opera series.  She is also co-author of the cookbook There are Herbs in My Chocolate, which combines culinary herbs and chocolate in over 60 sweet and savory recipes. She also had a long-running column for Dave’s Garden, where she covered gardening and crafting. She blogs about creative writing techniques and all things chocolate-related at <a href=""http://www.amberroyer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.amberroyer.com</a>.  She also teaches creative writing in North Texas for both UT Arlington Continuing Education and Writing Workshops Dallas.  If you are very nice to her, she might make you cupcakes.</p>
<p>If you are new to the Chocoverse, bienveindo!  Here are the book trailers for the first two books to help get you up to speed.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In this series, there is something for everyone.  You get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alien dragons</li>
<li>An adorable corgi</li>
<li>Laser monkey robots</li>
<li>Wombat cyborgs</li>
<li>Shark monsters that eat people</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the expenses I need to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover art to match the AWESOME art I have in place for Books 1 and 2</li>
<li>Professional editing</li>
<li>Book trailer to match the AMAZING ones X27 Films and Media did for Book 1 and 2</li>
<li>Production and shipping of the print copies of the book (including ISBN)</li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A number of people have asked me how I can write about chocolate in the future when the future of chocolate as an actual botanical plant is in question.  The more people are interested in chocolate, the more options there will be.  My husband and I have been experimenting with growing cacao indoors as office plants.  We created a series of videos documenting The Office Cacao Project.  Here's the first one.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgexsXtaUUY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Doing the first two books has allowed me to partner with <a href=""http://www.dallaschocolate.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.DallasChocolate.org</a>, and to learn about initiatives craft chocolate makers are working on to improve transparency in the small-scale production supply chain -- and also transparency in production techniques.   (We've actually gotten to take hands on classes in chocolate making from makers at companies including Fresco Chocolate, Five Mile Chocolate and Potomac Chocolate). In a small attempt to give back, I have started interviewing chocolate makers and chocolatiers on my blog <a href=""http://www.amberroyer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.amberroyer.com</a>. </p>
<p>There is so much generosity in the craft chocolate community.  People have allowed me to tour their factories (including one in Monterrey Mexico and one in small-town Hico, Texas) and plantations (in the Domincan Republic) and have offered their expertise in making sure I get what I am writing about chocolate correct. </p>
<p><strong>This is an expansive 'verse. I have a short story set in the Chocoverse coming out soon in Issue 5 of Amazing Stories.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Free Chocolate garnered a number of positive reviews, including this one from Publisher's Weekly:</strong></p>
<p>“In writing teacher Royer’s clever debut, humans have turned Earth into a fear-filled bunker after learning about the existence of aliens. Earth’s sole valuable commodity on the interplanetary market is chocolate, and some humans will do anything to preserve its value. Bodacious “Bo” Benitez wants to disrupt the system by smuggling cacao plants offworld, but doing so brings her face-to-face with her alien boyfriend’s hidden past, the man who murdered her chocolate-smuggling father, and the possibility of global war. The story is languidly paced and occasionally feels too drawn out, but Royer keeps things interesting by portraying how one tiny encounter can quickly spiral out of control in an interconnected galaxy. The aliens aren’t out to conquer Earth, just the markets, and they ruthlessly wield economics and niceties instead of lasers, to darkly comic and sometimes deadly serious effect. Trade-related science fiction is a small but solid niche, and Royer’s work fills it nicely. Agent: Jennie Goloboy, Donald Maass Literary. (June)"" — Publisher’s Weekly</p>
<p><strong>The Barnes and Noble SFF Blog broke down the whole of Book 1 in an extensive post.  Here are a few paragraphs:</strong></p>
<p>Bo Benitez (“Bo” being short for Bodacious) has chocolate in her blood, almost literally: her father died in a (suspicious) fire at a cacao plantation, and her mother is a superstar celebrity chef working with the sponsorship of HGB. Bo herself is a culinary student being groomed by the coffee giant as a spokesmodel. She’s not much interested in that path, as it turns out, and it doesn’t take much to convince her that the chocolate monopoly is as bad for Earth as it is for the galactic community. To some extent, she falls into activism, egged on by her alien boyfriend, but she quickly proves (almost) as capable of getting into trouble as of getting out of it as she attempts to free the bean.</p>
<p>In spite of her connections at the coffee company, nothing goes according to plan. Which is, naturally, part of the fun. And for a book that begins with a history lesson about coffee, fun is clearly the reason to read this deliciously rich chunk of space opera. Bo’s schemes put her up against deadly robot monkeys, on a chase through an alien spaceport, and onto a ship full of aliens best known for eating stowaways. The aliens, in general, are imaginative (they generally relate to Earth animals, even though the various alien species find it tacky when humans point it out): Bo’s boyfriend is a Krom, a species of manipulative traders whose eyes change colors when they lie; her best friend is a cat-like creature who makes humans shudder. An honorable reptilian cop joins the hunt for Bo and her illicit beans.</p>
<p>Royer’s language is a key draw. Her human characters generally hail from South America, with English serving as a core tongue, but liberally sprinkled with Spanish and bits of Portuguese. That particular flavor of bi-/tri-lingual blending isn’t uncommon in the world today, but Free Chocolate suggests a continued evolution and formalization that makes perfect sense. -- <a href=""https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/the-great-cocoa-heist-youll-eat-up-amber-royers-free-chocolate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fant...</a></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The manuscript for the book has been completely drafted and is in the editing stage.  The challenge will be in getting the marketing in place to make the project a success with readers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first two books had traditional publishing's marketing power behind them.  This will help readers recognize the series.</li>
<li>I have taken several classes related to social media marketing, and scheduled appearances promoting the first two books across the country.  I already have a launch event for book 3 scheduled locally in partnership with Interabang Books and a chocolatier associated with DallasChocolate.org -- and a followup event at Indi Chocolate in Seattle.</li>
<li>I am anticipating interviews on blogs and podcasts, and will actively work to set more up.</li>

And yes, mercy is a gift.  Pero . . . money is a gift, too.  I have a hard time asking for this, but I need help if I'm going to make this book available to readers.  I've already written Fake Chocolate.  What I need from you guys is support for professional quality cover art, a thorough edit (because, seriously, it's nearly impossible to catch all the places where Tyson can't say TH all by myself), and all of the production stages that get a book into the hands of readers.  There's a lot that goes into this.  The font with the swooping c-s alone is going to cost roughly $200.
A lot of you visiting this probably know me.  But if you don't, here's my bio:  Amber Royer writes the CHOCOVERSE comic telenovela-style foodie-inspired space opera series.  She is also co-author of the cookbook There are Herbs in My Chocolate, which combines culinary herbs and chocolate in over 60 sweet and savory recipes. She also had a long-running column for Dave’s Garden, where she covered gardening and crafting. She blogs about creative writing techniques and all things chocolate-related at www.amberroyer.com.  She also teaches creative writing in North Texas for both UT Arlington Continuing Education and Writing Workshops Dallas.  If you are very nice to her, she might make you cupcakes.
If you are new to the Chocoverse, bienveindo!  Here are the book trailers for the first two books to help get you up to speed.

 

 

What We Need & What You Get
In this series, there is something for everyone.  You get:

Alien dragons
An adorable corgi
Laser monkey robots
Wombat cyborgs
Shark monsters that eat people

Here's the expenses I need to cover:

Cover art to match the AWESOME art I have in place for Books 1 and 2
Professional editing
Book trailer to match the AMAZING ones X27 Films and Media did for Book 1 and 2
Production and shipping of the print copies of the book (including ISBN)


 
The Impact
A number of people have asked me how I can write about chocolate in the future when the future of chocolate as an actual botanical plant is in question.  The more people are interested in chocolate, the more options there will be.  My husband and I have been experimenting with growing cacao indoors as office plants.  We created a series of videos documenting The Office Cacao Project.  Here's the first one.

 
Doing the first two books has allowed me to partner with www.DallasChocolate.org, and to learn about initiatives craft chocolate makers are working on to improve transparency in the small-scale production supply chain -- and also transparency in production techniques.   (We've actually gotten to take hands on classes in chocolate making from makers at companies including Fresco Chocolate, Five Mile Chocolate and Potomac Chocolate). In a small attempt to give back, I have started interviewing chocolate makers and chocolatiers on my blog www.amberroyer.com. 
There is so much generosity in the craft chocolate community.  People have allowed me to tour their factories (including one in Monterrey Mexico and one in small-town Hico, Texas) and plantations (in the Domincan Republic) and have offered their expertise in making sure I get what I am writing about chocolate correct. 
This is an expansive 'verse. I have a short story set in the Chocoverse coming out soon in Issue 5 of Amazing Stories.

Free Chocolate garnered a number of positive reviews, including this one from Publisher's Weekly:
“In writing teacher Royer’s clever debut, humans have turned Earth into a fear-filled bunker after learning about the existence of aliens. Earth’s sole valuable commodity on the interplanetary market is chocolate, and some humans will do anything to preserve its value. Bodacious “Bo” Benitez wants to disrupt the system by smuggling cacao plants offworld, but doing so brings her face-to-face with her alien boyfriend’s hidden past, the man who murdered her chocolate-smuggling father, and the possibility of global war. The story is languidly paced and occasionally feels too drawn out, but Royer keeps things interesting by portraying how one tiny encounter can quickly spiral out of control in an interconnected galaxy. The aliens aren’t out to conquer Earth, just the markets, and they ruthlessly wield economics and niceties instead of lasers, to darkly comic and sometimes deadly serious effect. Trade-related science fiction is a small but solid niche, and Royer’s work fills it nicely. Agent: Jennie Goloboy, Donald Maass Literary. (June)"" — Publisher’s Weekly
The Barnes and Noble SFF Blog broke down the whole of Book 1 in an extensive post.  Here are a few paragraphs:
Bo Benitez (“Bo” being short for Bodacious) has chocolate in her blood, almost literally: her father died in a (suspicious) fire at a cacao plantation, and her mother is a superstar celebrity chef working with the sponsorship of HGB. Bo herself is a culinary student being groomed by the coffee giant as a spokesmodel. She’s not much interested in that path, as it turns out, and it doesn’t take much to convince her that the chocolate monopoly is as bad for Earth as it is for the galactic community. To some extent, she falls into activism, egged on by her alien boyfriend, but she quickly proves (almost) as capable of getting into trouble as of getting out of it as she attempts to free the bean.
In spite of her connections at the coffee company, nothing goes according to plan. Which is, naturally, part of the fun. And for a book that begins with a history lesson about coffee, fun is clearly the reason to read this deliciously rich chunk of space opera. Bo’s schemes put her up against deadly robot monkeys, on a chase through an alien spaceport, and onto a ship full of aliens best known for eating stowaways. The aliens, in general, are imaginative (they generally relate to Earth animals, even though the various alien species find it tacky when humans point it out): Bo’s boyfriend is a Krom, a species of manipulative traders whose eyes change colors when they lie; her best friend is a cat-like creature who makes humans shudder. An honorable reptilian cop joins the hunt for Bo and her illicit beans.
Royer’s language is a key draw. Her human characters generally hail from South America, with English serving as a core tongue, but liberally sprinkled with Spanish and bits of Portuguese. That particular flavor of bi-/tri-lingual blending isn’t uncommon in the world today, but Free Chocolate suggests a continued evolution and formalization that makes perfect sense. -- https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fant...

 
Risks & Challenges
The manuscript for the book has been completely drafted and is in the editing stage.  The challenge will be in getting the marketing in place to make the project a success with readers.

The first two books had traditional publishing's marketing power behind them.  This will help readers recognize the series.
I have taken several classes related to social media marketing, and scheduled appearances promoting the first two books across the country.  I already have a launch event for book 3 scheduled locally in partnership with Interabang Books and a chocolatier associated with DallasChocolate.org -- and a followup event at Indi Chocolate in Seattle.
I am anticipating interviews on blogs and podcasts, and will actively work to set more up.

Further, <i>Accessible Herbaria</i> presents multiple approaches toward supporting health, complimentary to any current health care management.</p><p>For the ally, <i>Accessible Herbaria</i> is a resource for better consideration of disabled, neurodivergent, black/brown indigenous people of color (BIPOC), fat, chronically ill, LGBTQI &amp; gender-nonconforming people. While whether to support diverse clients, students, colleagues, and friends is typically not a question, doing so without projecting personal bias is a greater challenge than simple intention.</p><p>Not only are you ensuring my course, and with it earning my deepest gratitude, but I am excited to offer perks in return. If you are new to this site, I made a note in the FAQ about this, and the site provides more info in the FAQ section.</p><p>I deeply appreciate your time and your consideration as I continue to my next right thing.</p><p> </p><p>My goal is admittedly high, with the figure applying over several years. Here’s a breakdown of essential steps, because every bit helps and I will work hard to make up the difference:</p><p>First benchmark- almost funded!!!, $2,000: With my personal inquiry already completed, I will engage in an apprenticeship in spring and summer of 2019, gaining over 250 hours of study. I’ll learn every aspect of herbalism, from an expert registered herbalist. This work directly applies to my certification as a registered herbalist and lays the foundation for a lifetime of learning. As part of the final project of my apprenticeship, I will begin work on my book, and complete it directly following. </p><p>Research of scholarly articles for <i>Accessible Herbaria</i> requires access to multiple high-quality sources for each topic. Yearly subscriptions to journals can be up to $300/year, and individual articles cost up to $35 each. Thorough research will require at least $5,000, but possibly much more. I’ll use these funds from fall 2019, through summer 2020. I have access to articles now, but it’s limited.</p><p>Professional Illustration &amp; Photography normally costs about $250 per illustration, digital photography is at least $75 per shot. I will do this work myself, so the $7,000 will stay in-house. This funding, I’ll be able to save, but will use my time and resources from spring 2019 to summer 2020.</p><p>Layout &amp; Editing another one I will do myself, about $1,000, starting summer 2020.</p><p>A reserve of at least $5,000: to provide seeds and supplies to readers who might not have access to high-quality seed stock, and to provide the print edition of the book on a sliding scale, so it is available for all. This comes into play after the book is out, and will go on indefinitely. I’ll likely post another fund to get this really set up.</p><p>My herbal study, $2,000: a known, but vastly under-used, genus that aids hyperglycemia, liver health, has antioxidant properties &amp; more. Once this survey is complete, it will be of great use to far more people. I hope you will say that you helped make it so. I’ll start work on this in fall of 2019, and expect I will complete it, along with the other big projects, in 2020.</p><p>The rest of the fund I expect to spread out over several years-I’ve only ever lived on a little, and can make it stretch-whatever is shared allows me to write, particularly during daylight hours, and not work late into the night once my kid is in bed. </p><p>To claim an inclusive practice in whatever sphere we engage ourselves, we require a new set of tools—to better address assumptions and prejudices, both within our larger community and ourselves. This project aims to do some of the work so that when minorities and marginalized people speak, practitioners may listen. <i>Accessible Herbaria</i> will convey the foundations of intersectionality and allyship, through dialogue, and promoting primary sources. From understanding new phrases and definitions, to appreciating deeper issues being faced by minorities and marginalized people—by taking charge of our own awareness, we may acknowledge these multi-faceted concerns, and support all members of our communities.</p><p>Some topics for allies include the emotional labor of self-advocacy, intersectionality, non-binary gender identities, trauma-informed care, body positivity, honoring traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) &amp; supporting the empowerment of BIPOC in community-specific medicine.</p><p>Who else will I write this book for? For transgender &amp; non-binary folks, who want to support the needs of their own bodies, but can’t find the information.

In US culture, we expect postpartum, and menopause to create emotional and physical isolation and disturbance, while they are also discussed with shame and misunderstanding, if at all. Juxtaposed with other cultures, birthing parents and people with menopause find deep support and these significant disorders are uncommon.</p><p>For folks living in cities, and those with limited access to green or growing space, and for folks who can’t access those spaces.

Herbal medicine seeks to support the whole individual, just as western medicine addresses only symptoms.

<p>Healing happens is a collection of creative writings sharing a common theme – personal empowerment. In this day of advancing technologies such as facebooking, twittering, and various other forms of verb born in our century – it seems the need and desire to “connect” remains intact as the primary motivation. </p>
<p>We want to know that we are not alone. We want to know that we matter. We are afraid to believe that when we are talking about something or someone, amazing, gifted and special – that we are free to include ourselves in that conversation.</p>
<p>Healing happens offers the insight found along many pathways that we are only as alone as we wish to be. Born with us is our own personal right to survive and experience life. Of course what that means from one to another varies greatly.</p>
<p>Ironically, I am a rather quiet and private person. Yet throughout my day, I interact with many people suffering in various ways – physically, mentally, emotionally. The tenacity of people, their ability to endure, is what both inspired and encouraged me to finally print and publish some of my writings that have only been held back by fear for too many years.</p>
<p>I have found that through the sharing these works people have discovered a kindred spirit, not only with another, but their very own. It is becoming a welcome surprise. While I am still on shaky ground and fear based thoughts revisit often, I am also gaining hope with growing interest and positive feedback. </p>
<p>Is it for everyone? I could say yes or no, but so what? Ice cream isn’t for everyone, but it’s on lots of freezer shelves anyway – either for oneself to enjoy or for a visitor who might also enjoy. </p>
<p>So I am reaching out for help in moving forward with a project that I believe in.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need a little help holding on, or letting go. This book does a little of both. Either way, readers “feel” something through the honesty in print. If we do nothing else with our lives, let us not forget to feel it as we go.</p>
<p><strong>About the Book</strong></p>
<p>This book has already received powerful feedback from people. Here are some reviews from amazon.com:</p>
<p>""This is a book that captures the true essence of healing mind, body and soul. The authors journey to wholeness is raw, authentic and inspiring! I would highly recommend this book to all who seek to understand themselves better and to bring clarity to what it means to arrive in the present moment. Michelle's writing speaks to a deeper level of humanness, where all of our darkness and light reside. Her ability to integrate her path is simply pure and candid. A must read for those traveling on this road, or those who have gratitude for having experienced this most sacred path.""<span>  </span></p>
<p>""What a powerful book. I had to stop reading at some parts because I was so <br/>stunned at how much the words were my words...the feelings my feelings...the <br/>stories my stories. I think this book has something for anyone on their own <br/>journey of finding their truth. I can't wait to read it again!""</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; Perks for Your Support</h3>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for promotion of this book. I've got the book on amazon.com, but want to reach people more personally. I plan to visit book stores, coffeehouses, wellness centers and other places that seem open to the idea to talk to people about my book.</p>
<p>We will use the money we raise to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover marketing costs.</li>
<li>Provide copies of the book for giveaways at events.</li>
<li>Cover costs for traveling to places in the Midwest area (IL, IN, WI, MI, KY etc) to introduce myself and this project, which I believe can help and empower people wherever they are in their lives.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><b>The Perks of Being a Funder</b></b></p>
<p>I believe that mutual benefit and reciprocity are important. In exchange for your support in funding the growth of my project I'm providing a variety of thank you's - handwritten poems, signed copies of my book, a mention on my website as a supporter and an in-person poetry reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Is It Important?</h3>
<p>Healing happens is important because, let's face it - life is sometimes hard. Sometimes life is always hard. But it doesn't really have to be.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Creative
writing is one of the few professions where you produce something nobody really
wants. No one goes into a bookstore and requests a book that has three
protagonists set in Canada, France, England and the deserts of Niger. And specifies
that the book be written in present and past tense. Still, as writers, we continue
to write.</p>
<p>I’m
fortunate to have had five books published through traditional trade publishers
and collected some awards along the way. My last novel, <i>Quintet</i>, won the Thomas Head Raddall Atlantic Fiction Prize and rave reviews in the Canadian national press. My
children’s book, <i>The Magic Compass</i>,
was placed in all elementary schools in Nova Scotia by the Department of
Education. I’ve also received an Established Artist Recognition Award from the province
of Nova Scotia and last year I was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond
Jubilee Medal for my contribution to Canadian Culture.</p>
<p>Writers,
by nature, are entrepreneurs. Along the way I also published the former Canadian
literary magazine Pottersfield Portfolio for several years. With over twenty
years in the writing and publishing sector, recent years have been a challenge.
Fewer publishers, fewer books published and reduced or no advances. Last year I
created a small company called Boularderie Island Press that assists
professional Canadian writers in the transition from trade publishing to
self-publishing. Most of these writers are established but cannot get their
latest work published. Writers like me.</p>
<p>I have
decided to self-publish my new novel <i>Seeds
</i>and am using Indiegogo as a platform to raise funds to assist in the book’s
publication.</p>
<p><i>Seeds</i> is the story of
Aphra Abrams, a celebrated television gardening guru who seeks out the daughter
she gave up for adoption fifty years ago. Unexpectedly, she not only locates
her daughter, Caroline, but a man Caroline claims is her brother <i>and </i>Aphra’s son. They all embark on a
journey that takes the reader to Canada, England, France, and the deserts of
Niger as the three of them seek to discover the meaning of <i>family</i>.</p>
<p>I
was once asked by a journalist why all of my novels deal with family. My answer
was that we all have one. <i>Seeds</i> weds
my exploration of family dynamics with my own personal love of gardening. </p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My
financial goal through Indiegogo is to raise $6900. However, the true cost of editing,
designing, publishing, marketing and distribution of my novel is at least double
that sum. However, I believe that I have a responsibility to commit my own
funds to the project. After all, if you have not personally invested in your own
ventures, you have nothing to lose, which can lead to complacency and
entitlement.</p>
<p>The funds
raised through my campaign will offset the costs of editing, design, formatting
and printing of the book, shipping the title, the production of a dedicated
website for the project, the cost of shipping promotional copies to media and
reviewers, and modest advertising costs.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although
this is my first crowd-sharing experience, I have created successful
fund-raising campaigns in the past. I am particularly proud of having created a
library of Canadian children’s literature for a rural elementary school on Cape
Breton Island, Nova Scotia where my appeal to Canadian publishers resulted in
the donation of books worth $4000. At another elementary school with a library
lacking books by Nova Scotia writers I was able to secure the donation of class
sets from publishers.</p>
<p>By supporting
this campaign you are helping me to publish my sixth book in the hope of reaching
readers both old and new and to enable the continued publication of professional
writing voices silenced by the dwindling trade publishing landscape in Canada.</p>
<p>Thank
you.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Michael White, and I've been a music journalist (often for love, seldom for money) in my native Canada for almost 20 years. Late in 2011, I was given the blessing of Matt Haynes and Clare Wadd to write an official biography of Sarah Records, the hugely influential independent record label they co-founded and jointly ran in Bristol, England, from 1987 to 1995. In addition to being somewhat averse to backward glancing, Matt and Clare are rigorously â€” and understandably â€” protective of Sarah's legacy and how its story is recounted, so to be given permission to write the first book-length account of the label is an enormous honour that I don't take lightly. I plan to conduct over 100 interviews and spend up to the next two years (but hopefully less) writing it. A publisher has not yet been secured; in the meantime, all expenses are being paid for out of my own pocket. As the Sarah Records story is of interest to a highly specialized â€” and, admittedly, limited â€” audience, I expect it will find a home with a small press and profit will be modest. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sarah Records â€” and the musical genre it exemplified, variously referred to as 'indiepop,' 'C86,' 'twee' and other descriptors of questionable accuracy and flattery â€” has never been written about with the depth of research and credibility it deserves. My aim is to finally validate the accomplishments of Sarah, and the small but influential underground culture from which it sprung, with the same journalistic seriousness and thoroughness that has been afforded to every other kind of music that has cast a significant influence. More importantly, I want the book to have an appeal far beyond Sarah's existing cult following. I want it to be a great music biography, period, that has the potential to entertain and enlighten anyone, regardless of their musical preferences.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The single most important endeavour while writing the book is to visit the UK â€” ideally during April or May of this year â€” to conduct in-person interviews and carry out other crucial research that cannot easily be done from my home in Toronto. Without a publisher's advance, this will have to be paid for by me â€” something I'm unable to do alone. I'm hoping to raise a modest $1,800 to cover some (but not all) of the travel and accommodation costs of the trip. While I cannot offer anything substantial in return for donors' generosity, I'm offering the theme-appropriate gift of access to a download mix of some of the best and rarest (non-Sarah) indiepop from my extensive collection. It is also my hope that once the book is ready for publication, I'll be able to offer donors early shipment. (Of course, this will depend on the cooperation of the publisher.) </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Hey horror fans! Welcome to the Indiegogo page for my novel <em>‘The Grotesque.’ </em>My name’s Vinnie and I'm a writer/director/illustrator who has just finished directing my horror feature movie ‘Haters’. My passion is writing; telling a story that will thrill, charm, amuse, or terrify those turning the pages of my novels, listening to my radio plays, or perhaps one day watching my movies on the 'big screen'. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">The project at hand, and the one that really needs your help, is my novel 'The Grotesque'. I've had this story in my head for several years now. It's a particularly dark, malevolent, and truly terrifying tale in which we see an ancient evil introduced into the life of a young boy who has already suffered an unfair number of life traumas. I finished writing this story recently and have since been designing the cover and thinking of ways to finance its publication. A friend suggested Indiegogo and well, here I am. </p>
<p>Before I continue, have a read of my synopsis...</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">“<em>To say that Mark’s year had been a bad one would be a gross understatement. It all began with the accident; the car crash that took his father away, forcing him and his mother to uproot and move across the city. </em><em>In school, he got into fights...lots; so many in-fact that Detention and Suspension became words his mother began to hear on a weekly basis, but it was the crash that started it all, and to Mark it was all that mattered, everything since was merely crash residue.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><em>GREEN AMBER RED! Mark’s father hadn’t seen red at all, he had however seen rose coloured visions of perfection as he stumbled from the wreck of his car to ask the driver from the other twisted car wreck, “Are you alive?” Anne - the other driver - calmly alighted what was left of her car and replied, “I am,” before fainting onto the tarmac. That afternoon, Anne and Mark’s father bought two coffees in the hospital canteen. That night, Anne and Mark’s father decided that they were meant to be together.The accident had taken Mark’s father away as sure as if he’d smashed through the windscreen of his car, causing his head to be sliced clean off in the process. Mark hated that year. The year his mother cried constantly. The year in which his bottled up feelings of rage, fear, and disappointment became so increasingly warped they finally manifested into a dark presence, a brooding and violent other-worldly creature, a creature whose sole purpose was to destroy the one responsible for its horrific existence.”</em> </p>
<h3>What We'll Achieve</h3>
<p>I figure that if I want to do this the right way, I'm not going to go by half-measures. I'm going to get it professionally edited, professionally marketed and distributed both electronically and as a print piece. I'm going big, because that's the only way to really make this work. </p>
<p>Should I make my funding limit, I'll contract through <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/wymeditor_iframe/Lulu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Lulu.com</span></a> to deal with my editing, design and distribution; depending on my options, I may go elsewhere for editing and marketing services. I'll set up a website for the book and I'll dedicate myself to moving the book forward and moving myself forward as an author. </p>
<div>
<h3>Our Goal &amp; Your Rewards</h3>
<p>The goal is to reach $7500. This will go towards all the priorities above, plus a Grotesque website, and also rewriting the book as a screenplay. The perks are many (as you can see listed on the right) and are well worth investing in. They include original signed novels, surprise horror packages, and original artworks. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>More Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So that's my story. If you can help by giving a few coins and upwards then that will be greatly appreciated, but if your help comes by way of telling friends, family, the media (blogs, twitter, facebook, local newspapers etc.) or associates about my campaign, then that will also be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>With Your Help...</h3>
<p><strong>...</strong>The Grotesque will one day hit the bookshelves with the force of the best Stephen King novel, so please support this campaign as this story's worth telling. It's worth reading. It's worth your help.</p>
Thanks for your time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Shane Pinnegar, from Perth, Western Australia, and I need your help to publish my debut novel, Jada: Mountain Warrior as an Exclusive First Edition paperback. Jada is an exciting fantasy adventure story which I wrote for tweens, teens and big kids like me (and you)!</p>
<p>I hope you will join me here on Indiegogo and become one of Jada's Warriors. I'm offering some cool rewards for contributors - you can pre-order the book, become a patron or platinum sponsor of the book, and even get yourself written into and featured on the cover of my next novel.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
<p>I’ve wanted to write a novel since I was twelve years old, but my insecurity got in the way and I always found other things to do. I worked in computer support, travelled the world and worked as a chef not only in Australia, but also England, France, Canada and Greece, ran a catering business for sixteen years, and for the past ten years I've written about rock n’ roll, movies and books on my 100% ROCK MAGAZINE website, as well as for a bunch of other magazines.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m publishing my debut novel, Jada: Mountain Warrior.</p>
<p>Of course I could just publish this novel digitally, but I love holding a book in my hands and most of my friends do too. With your help, I’ll produce an Exclusive First Edition Paperback complete with a never-to-be-published-elsewhere short story. I’ll even sign and dedicate it if you like.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>A Little About The Book</h3>
<p>JADA: MOUNTAIN WARRIOR is a fantasy novel that is as exciting for adults as for teens, and its positive messages are relevant to all of us, no matter what age we are. I think it's suitable for all ages over eleven, but parents should be aware that there are monsters and fighting in the book, and some people and monsters do get killed.</p>
<p>The book has an amazing cover thanks to artist Dave Howarth, who really captured the strength and positivity of Jada and her unicorn.</p>
<p>Jada is a courageous tweenage warrior-in-training and unicorn herder, and when her and her clan are attacked by monsters atop the mountain where they live, she must learn great courage to protect her family and their unicorn herd.</p>
<p>If she is to defeat their attackers, Jada will need to draw on her mother and father’s wisdom and leadership, as well as new-found magical powers she doesn’t yet understand. As Jada goes into battle she discovers that in sacrifice and selflessness there can be found great power.</p>
<p>She is given strength in this adventure by the return of her ‘imaginary’ childhood friend Bando, and the special bond she shares with a unicorn named Baby.</p>
<p>Jada: Mountain Warrior is a positive and uplifting fantasy adventure full of action and some fundamental positive messages about finding oneself and finding courage, with a little help from those we care about.</p>
<p>My early readers have loved the book, calling it ""gripping,"" ""unputdownable"" (which if it isn't already a word, certainly should be), ""fantastic and uplifting"" and ""so good it made me cry.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Breaking Down The Money</h3>
<p>I'm aiming to raise $2650 through this campaign.</p>
<p>This will allow for a print run of 100 books ($1250), artwork for the book cover by artist Dave Howarth, graphic design for this campaign ($500), shipping costs ($600), Indiegogo and credit card fees (approx $300).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not interested in buying a book right now? I hear you, brothers and sisters. You can still help this campaign by sharing this page or my social media posts to your own networks. The more noise you make, the better chance we have for Jada to find her audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Links and stuff</h3>
<p>You can find out more about me at my website shanepinnegarwriter.com and sign up for my newsletter to find out what I am up to.</p>
<p>My rock n' roll and other pop culture reviews and interviews are at 100percentrock.com. I've also written for X-Press Magazine, Around The Sound, Beat Magazine, Brag Magazine, Mysteria Maxima Magazine, The Rockpit and a couple of others as well, so there are other things out there if you Google.</p>

<h3>UPDATE &amp; STRETCH GOALS</h3>
<p>I am blown away by the response to this campaign so far - after only eight days we're running hot at well over 180% of my initial goal. Sincere superthanks to you all for backing this project and sharing the link around, it means a lot and you've helped me realise a childhood dream.</p>
<p>Since we have just cracked AUD $5,000 (woo hoo!!!), I am going to print some cool bookmarks featuring the Jada cover art, and every physical order will get one with their book as a special thankyou from me to you.</p>
<p>I want to make this the best damned book it can be, as well as provide some incentives to keep the campaign rocking and rolling, so I have thought up two major stretch goals.</p>
<p>If the campaign can raise AUD $7,500, I will be able to commission a further series of illustrations for inside the book from our extremely talented cover artist, Mr Dave Howarth, Esquire. Check his cartoon and graphic design work here, he’s an unsung legend — <a href=""http://www.hmdesigners.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hmdesigners.com/</a></p>
<p>If the campaign reaches AUD $12,000, then all orders of physical books will be fulfilled in a super-special, ultra-unique hard-cover format, destined to become a collector’s item as well as a work of art in itself. This might be a long-shot, but if we can all pull together and make the campaign go viral, maybe not… so please encourage all those you think might be interested to chip in, buy a book, and share amongst their networks. You rock!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's all for now, folks - thanks for reading/watching/listening and if you want to get involved, please click on the option on the right should you wish to purchase right now, and help me bring Jada to life in paperback.</p>
<p>Have an excellent day!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hello, persons...</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I'm Elizabeth Cogar,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">and I'm writing a book called</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Really</i> Richmond: A City Guide</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3><strong>+Why am I doing this, you ask?</strong></h3>
<p>1. I'm a writer and knower of many things about Richmond, Virginia because... </p>
<p>2. I'm from here and have explored most every nook and cranny of the environs.</p>
<p>3. I once worked at Richmond's visitor center where I told thousands of tourists about all there is to do here. I also helped them find places, like ""Chickenham Parkway"" and  ""Fallopian Turnpike."" Hmmm. <i>Ah, that road on Southside.</i> And the ever popular, ""How do I get back on 95?"" To which I'd say: <i>Wait one minute! Stay here! We're fun!</i></p>
<p>4. I'm always up for a challenge!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>+Ok, but why are you writing it now?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I recently noticed that there is no current Richmond guide book in print</strong>, other than some very nice books about history. I thought, maybe I should write a book to help people find the cool places around here. So I put pen to paper (not really), and with your help, I can have them on shop shelves in December.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>+Who's <i>really</i> going to buy/sell/give <i>REALLY</i> RICHMOND—A City Guide?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">•Visitors, present and future (7 million a year!)<br/>•Locals <br/>•Their out of town guests<br/>•Tourism, convention and economic development professionals<br/>•Newcomers<br/>•Bookstores and gift shops<br/>•Airbnbs, hotels, inns<br/>•Real estate agents<br/>•Corporate recruiters and relocation specialists<br/>•People who prepare gift baskets and welcome packets<br/>•People who conduct orientations for businesses and organizations <br/>•and others I haven't even thought of yet!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>+What's REAL about the book?</strong></h3>
<p>My main focus is on places and experiences that are <i>really</i> Richmond — most are locally owned and some are one of a kind. There's info on museums, cafes, places to stay, historical sites, one-way streets, theaters, breweries, street art, shopping, tattoos, galleries, parks, tours, events and lots more.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>+How are you going to print it? Won't it get outdated fast?</strong></h3>
<p>I'm self-publishing with a great print-on-demand printer and distributor. When I finish the book, I'll upload a PDF to them, order some and receive them within two weeks. </p>
<p><strong>Best of all</strong>, at any time, I can make corrections and upload a new PDF to the printer and they will immediately start printing with the updated text. So nice!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>This sounds just great. How can we help?!</u></h3>
<p><strong>I need $5,250 to complete this project and get the books out into the world. </strong></p>
<p>The funds are needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete my research and writing</li>
<li>Enlist the spectacular talents of graphic designer <strong>Alex Fulton</strong> and artist <strong>Chris Milk</strong>
</li>
<li>Do an initial printing of books</li>
<li>Cover start-up marketing costs</li>

Hello, persons...
I'm Elizabeth Cogar,
and I'm writing a book called
Really Richmond: A City Guide
 
+Why am I doing this, you ask?
1. I'm a writer and knower of many things about Richmond, Virginia because... 
2. I'm from here and have explored most every nook and cranny of the environs.
3. I once worked at Richmond's visitor center where I told thousands of tourists about all there is to do here. I also helped them find places, like ""Chickenham Parkway"" and  ""Fallopian Turnpike."" Hmmm. Ah, that road on Southside. And the ever popular, ""How do I get back on 95?"" To which I'd say: Wait one minute! Stay here! We're fun!
4. I'm always up for a challenge!
 
+Ok, but why are you writing it now?
I recently noticed that there is no current Richmond guide book in print, other than some very nice books about history. I thought, maybe I should write a book to help people find the cool places around here. So I put pen to paper (not really), and with your help, I can have them on shop shelves in December.
 
+Who's really going to buy/sell/give REALLY RICHMOND—A City Guide?
•Visitors, present and future (7 million a year!)•Locals •Their out of town guests•Tourism, convention and economic development professionals•Newcomers•Bookstores and gift shops•Airbnbs, hotels, inns•Real estate agents•Corporate recruiters and relocation specialists•People who prepare gift baskets and welcome packets•People who conduct orientations for businesses and organizations •and others I haven't even thought of yet!
 
+What's REAL about the book?
My main focus is on places and experiences that are really Richmond — most are locally owned and some are one of a kind. There's info on museums, cafes, places to stay, historical sites, one-way streets, theaters, breweries, street art, shopping, tattoos, galleries, parks, tours, events and lots more.
 

+How are you going to print it? Won't it get outdated fast?
I'm self-publishing with a great print-on-demand printer and distributor. When I finish the book, I'll upload a PDF to them, order some and receive them within two weeks. 
Best of all, at any time, I can make corrections and upload a new PDF to the printer and they will immediately start printing with the updated text. So nice!
 
This sounds just great. How can we help?!
I need $5,250 to complete this project and get the books out into the world. 
The funds are needed to:

Complete my research and writing
Enlist the spectacular talents of graphic designer Alex Fulton and artist Chris Milk

Do an initial printing of books
Cover start-up marketing costs

<p>I am so grateful to have already raised $1569 toward my $4000 campaign goal for the publishing of my book! After speaking to my publisher (New Degree Press) we have decided to launch a new campaign so that I can raise the balance of the funding needed for the publication of Mirrors and Windows. I would be so grateful if you would continue sharing with people in your network to bring us to the finish line! </p>
<p><a href=""https://igg.me/at/hNkg2uy050o/x/23236812#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/hNkg2uy050o/x/23236812#/</a></p>
<p>With gratitude, </p>
<p>Rosie Baker </p>
<p> </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mirrors and Windows is about envisioning and how to use it to successfully achieve your goals. It also follows the stories of empowering women who are living their dream jobs, how they achieved them, and what advice they would give to others.<br/><br/>My name is Rosie Baker, and I am the author of Mirrors and Windows. I wrote this book because I am curious about the power of vision and the impact of mentors and role models in our lives. What’s more, I wanted to learn about career paths and gather advice from empowering women in various fields of work.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new way to envision your success as well as learn from the stories and advice of the women featured in it. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for envisioning with mentors and role models in you. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you achieve your goals whether career-oriented or personal.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>The powering of vision - how it is has helped many achieve their goals, as well as cancer patients and those recovering.</li>
<li>How dreams can become reality - Dr. G is a STEM high school professor. She dreamed of being an astronaut and is now training to go to space next year despite the odds being against her.</li>
<li>Being a women does not limit your choice in careers and what to do in life - learn from others that you can achieve whatever you put your mind to</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to change the way you think to achieve your goals.<br/><br/>Mirrors and Windows is a non-fiction book that speaks to those in high school or college, those who are planning a career change and are looking at what they want in the future, and those who are setting new goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book - Mirrors and Windows</strong></h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Additional chapters.<br/>This section looks at what visualizing is and the importance of change and growth. Dr. G shares her story and gives an introduction to the concept, and we learn about Ashanti Johnson’s power of visualization.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-14.<br/>In this section, the principles of the mirror are explored and stories of empowering women are shared. Sheryl Sandberg’s TED Talk on why there are fewer women in the workplace is looked at, along with interviews from the CIO of Disney, a life coach, and a Beetle’s tour guide, plus many more. These women open new insights and share their advice from the knowledge they have gained.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 15-18.<br/>This section of the book is about building a mirror and creating your window to look through. How do you turn the dream you have into a reality? It explores different ways to visualize and how to turn your goals into the real thing.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>I am Rosie Baker, and I first became interested in the power of vision and learning from empowering women as a college student in Southern California pursuing a BA degree in Communication with an emphasis in Advertising and Public Relations.<br/><br/>I wrote this book to answer questions that I have and that I am sure many others have too. I wanted to see if there was a way to make goals achievable and ease the process which can sometimes seem overwhelming, especially if you are beginning your career. I believe that I have found a new way to envision success. This book will assure you that there are many others who did not know if their goals would be achievable, but they were, and they did achieve them.<br/><br/>When I’m not writing, I love spending time with my family and friends, especially at the beach or enjoying California sunny days. In 2015 I moved from a small town in England to the hustle and chaos of Los Angeles, where I now live.  I have grown up in two different cultures and love both of them in different ways, although sometimes I may forget the American word for something or someone may not understand me! <br/><br/>For more information you can connect with me at rosiebaker07@gmail.com and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosie-baker/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosie-baker/</a></p>

Mirrors and Windows is about envisioning and how to use it to successfully achieve your goals. It also follows the stories of empowering women who are living their dream jobs, how they achieved them, and what advice they would give to others.My name is Rosie Baker, and I am the author of Mirrors and Windows. I wrote this book because I am curious about the power of vision and the impact of mentors and role models in our lives. What’s more, I wanted to learn about career paths and gather advice from empowering women in various fields of work.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new way to envision your success as well as learn from the stories and advice of the women featured in it. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for envisioning with mentors and role models in you. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you achieve your goals whether career-oriented or personal.In this book, you'll learn:

The powering of vision - how it is has helped many achieve their goals, as well as cancer patients and those recovering.
How dreams can become reality - Dr. G is a STEM high school professor. She dreamed of being an astronaut and is now training to go to space next year despite the odds being against her.
Being a women does not limit your choice in careers and what to do in life - learn from others that you can achieve whatever you put your mind to

You will love this book if you want to change the way you think to achieve your goals.Mirrors and Windows is a non-fiction book that speaks to those in high school or college, those who are planning a career change and are looking at what they want in the future, and those who are setting new goals.
 
The Book - Mirrors and Windows
The book is written in 3 Parts...Part 1 contains the Introduction + Additional chapters.This section looks at what visualizing is and the importance of change and growth. Dr. G shares her story and gives an introduction to the concept, and we learn about Ashanti Johnson’s power of visualization.Part 2 contains Chapters 6-14.In this section, the principles of the mirror are explored and stories of empowering women are shared. Sheryl Sandberg’s TED Talk on why there are fewer women in the workplace is looked at, along with interviews from the CIO of Disney, a life coach, and a Beetle’s tour guide, plus many more. These women open new insights and share their advice from the knowledge they have gained.Part 3 contains Chapters 15-18.This section of the book is about building a mirror and creating your window to look through. How do you turn the dream you have into a reality? It explores different ways to visualize and how to turn your goals into the real thing.

About the Author
I am Rosie Baker, and I first became interested in the power of vision and learning from empowering women as a college student in Southern California pursuing a BA degree in Communication with an emphasis in Advertising and Public Relations.I wrote this book to answer questions that I have and that I am sure many others have too. I wanted to see if there was a way to make goals achievable and ease the process which can sometimes seem overwhelming, especially if you are beginning your career. I believe that I have found a new way to envision success. This book will assure you that there are many others who did not know if their goals would be achievable, but they were, and they did achieve them.When I’m not writing, I love spending time with my family and friends, especially at the beach or enjoying California sunny days. In 2015 I moved from a small town in England to the hustle and chaos of Los Angeles, where I now live.  I have grown up in two different cultures and love both of them in different ways, although sometimes I may forget the American word for something or someone may not understand me! For more information you can connect with me at rosiebaker07@gmail.com and https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosie-baker/

<p>When I was growing up, I wanted to write for Cosmopolitan. 
After entering university, my whole perspective changed and I saw that 
mainstream magazines don't reflect real women in our world. Typically, 
they don't show women who aren't straight or aren't caucasian and for 
some reason, it's still legal to photoshop models to make them look like
 society's idea of beauty. I stopped reading Cosmopolitan as much and 
picked up magazines like Adbusters and Vice - more controversial 
magazines that talk about the issues mainstream media don't usually 
cover. I wondered why we couldn't combine the fun and flirtiness of 
fashion magazines with intellectual debates and world issues. And then I
 realized we could. So I did. </p>

<h1>We Flurt! with society because we are more than baby-makers and sex-objects, we are movers and shakers.</h1>For
 3 years I have been running Flurt! out of my home by myself, along 
with, oh just, 30,000 of you reading the website monthly. Along with 
numerous volunteers, writers, editors, designers, interns and friends 
we've created something amazing I believe can go far. I want to see 
Flurt! on magazine stands where the rest of the identical, photoshopped,
 capitalism-focused magazines sit. I want to see a young woman pick up 
Flurt! and feel better about herself because she read a story about 
something that relates to her. Maybe she has an eating disorder,  a 
mental illness or doesn't look like the woman on the cover of the other 
magazines. And at Flurt!, we work to put reality onto our covers rather 
than airbrush a pretty face.<p></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Meet Alison</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1"">I’m Alison Gresik. I’m a writer who loves to travel, and I’m also a mom to two young kids. Last year, my husband and I sold our house so we could see the world as a family. We wanted a life that was simpler and more adventurous. And of course, we wanted to escape the Canadian winter! We call this journey Operation Hejira, after the Joni Mitchell road trip album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We lived in Penang, Malaysia from September to April, and we've just arrived in Europe to spend a few months in France and Holland. So life is pretty good right now.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But it wasn’t always like this.</p>
<p class=""p1"">About ten years ago, I was diagnosed with depression. Not the kind where I stayed in bed all day and never showered. The kind where I kept showing up for my two jobs, and trying to write a novel, and talking my family through their problems. The kind I call <a href=""http://www.gresik.ca/2012/03/10-signs-of-walking-depression/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">walking depression</a>. To the world it looked like I was handling everything just fine. But inside, I was so unhappy, I was a wreck. Nothing was fun, I was tired all the time, and I felt like I was wasting my life.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The one thing I had going for me was that I couldn’t believe I was meant to live this way. I was determined to get better so I could write the books I wanted to write, and have kids. And what I learned on the road to recovery has completely changed my life.</p>

<h2 class=""p1"">What creative people need to be joyful and whole </h2>
<p class=""p1"">The memoir I’m writing, <em>Pilgrimage of Desire</em>, is my way of sharing that story with the people who need to hear it. It’s for those who feel trapped in a life that doesn’t let them practice their creativity in a way that feeds their soul. It’s for those who have so much to express, but who’ve boxed themselves in with rules and responsibilities.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In my work as a <a href=""http://www.gresik.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">creativity coach</a> with writers and artists, I’ve been spreading the message that we’re happier when we claim the right to follow our desires and create on our own terms. And now it’s time to get that message out in the form of a memoir, to show how I went from the messy depths of despair to what feels like a charmed life. I hope that, by writing about the path I took and how it changed me, others may be able to embark on their own pilgrimage.</p>

<h2 class=""p1"">Why crowdfund?</h2>
<p class=""p1"">One thing that’s been brought home to me through Operation Hejira is the importance of community. It’s been hard to leave my friends and family behind in Canada, and I’m always looking for new ways to connect with people.</p>

We’ve chosen to self-publish Pilgrimage of Desire, which allows us to create exactly the book we want, with impeccable design that presents the story in its most moving form.
Click here to read Michelle's impassioned endorsement of Pilgrimage of Desire.
I'm also working with Brenda Leifso, a talented poet and editor, to make sure the text is compelling and professional.
So far I’ve written about a third of the book, and Michelle has designed the cover and  part of the interior.
Sign up on my mailing list at PilgrimageOfDesire.com to read the prologue and Chapter One.
This isn’t just generic black-and-white, it’s gorgeous, full-colour imagery and text, all packaged in Michelle’s evocative style. 
We will be producing both digital and high-quality limited edition print versions of Pilgrimage of Desire.

Why crowdfund?
One thing that’s been brought home to me through Operation Hejira is the importance of community. It’s been hard to leave my friends and family behind in Canada, and I’m always looking for new ways to connect with people.
To have you invested in this project, to have you share it with your friends and get excited about its publication, that will make a huge difference to its success and to my energy as I finish the book.
I’m raising funds for Pilgrimage of Desire to pay for the production costs ~ design, editing, and printing. 
And in return, I’ve put together a lovely array of rewards for contributors. Pilgrimage itself is the featured reward, so you can get a digital copy of the book, a limited edition print copy, or several to give as gifts.
For those of you who are ready to get started on designing your art-committed life, I’ve also included my coaching product, the Field Guide to Truth and Beauty, which is a self-guided retreat that helps you discover your beliefs and values in what you create.
And at the higher levels, you can get some personal consulting or coaching with me, where we can talk about the challenges you’re facing in creating what you need to create.
International backers outside of Canada and the US, please add $10 to your contribution to cover shipping costs. Thanks!
Important Note: I’ve set up this fundraiser as a Fixed campaign, which means that I only receive the money raised if we reach the goal of $10,000. If we fall short, I don’t collect anything, since we really need this full amount to finance the project.
Thank you so much for supporting Pilgrimage of Desire, whether it’s through a financial contribution or just getting the word out on Twitter, Facebook, or your personal blog.
Your generosity means the world to me.
I can't wait to get this book into your hands.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><br/></strong>Almost every financial book that I have read has either provided little practical advice toward creating and protecting real wealth or has been terribly dull and uninspiring.</p>
<p>I want to use my experience as someone that engaged in illegal insider trading for nearly 15 years and in over 100 separate deals to form the basis of a novel that conveys real-world financial advice to the reader through the retelling of the conversations and relationship I had with my Maximum-security cellmate and the deal we struck to exchange information on how to survive on the inside with advice on how to identify and exploit edges on the outside to legally make money in the stock market or any area of financial exchange.</p>
<p>As the first Canadian to receive and serve a Federal sentence of imprisonment for insider trading, I believe that I am well-suited to create a book that juxtaposes the rules of prison with the rules of finance; and, in so doing, provides an insight into both worlds that few have ever before considered.</p>
<p>The donation you make will help me to self-publish and will go toward copy and content editing, production, and marketing the book as well as motivating me to continue in my efforts (see Preface and Chapter 1 below).  This crowd-sourcing campaign is largely about assessing interest and generating support and buzz while rewarding and involving readers in the process of writing from the beginning.</p>
<p>I really do want to create something good from the bad that happened and your contribution can help me to do that.  Please contribute directly (and be rewarded with a Perk) or indirectly by copying and sharing the link below with others.  Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>THE NOVEL:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>AN INSIDE TRADER'S GUIDE TO GETTING RICH ...and then surviving prison<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>PREFACE</strong><br/><br/>Insider trading cost me everything.  It cost me the life of my best friend and co-accused.  It cost me my money and my possessions.  It cost me my marriage, my children, my reputation, and my freedom.  Everything. <br/><br/>Well ... maybe not everything.<br/><br/>I still have memories of the millions of dollars of profits and the tens of millions of dollars of trades as well as the opportunities and lifestyle provided by nearly fifteen years of turning improperly obtained information into enormous amounts of money.  More importantly, my ""run"" (as gamblers would call it) also gave me a unique insight into how the Market and other areas of financial exchange really work and how I could apply that knowledge -- legally -- to make as much or more money than I ever made illegally.  Unfortunately, I had to become an inmate in a maximum security prison to finally appreciate that my ability to find and obtain an ""edge"" already gave me the capacity to acquire the financial benefits and riches associated with illegal insider trading -- but without any of the risks.<br/><br/>The lessons you will find in this book helped me to survive prison and should, if applied with diligence and discipline, allow you to become rich.  It is a novel of my relationship with my cellmate and the record of the deal I made with him and other inmates to ensure my safety and well-being.  In short, I traded information on how to legally make money in the Market and elsewhere on the outside for knowledge on how to exist and survive in the predatory environment of hopelessness and violence on the inside.  The advice found within allows you to take from it what you will as my counsel moves along a spectrum of safe and certain to more aggressive and equally certain, but always with an eye toward finding and using an edge to ensure a profit.  Of course, that's not to say that if you happen to acquire inside information you won't also learn about what to do and not to do from my experiences (I certainly know what I would have done differently to avoid ever getting caught -- let alone convicted -- and will share that for you to do with as you wish).  It's simply that you don't need to have inside information or do anything improper to make the kind of money made by those, like myself, that did things that were not only improper but highly illegal. The advice that you will find in this book is tried, tested, and true.  Not only would I bet my life on it -- I already did.<br/><br/>I hope that the following will surprise, entertain and inform as it teaches you how to profit like a convicted inside trader -- without actually becoming one.<br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER 1:  ""INSIDE"" TRADING</strong><br/><br/>""Arms high. Grab the wall. Open your legs.""<br/><br/>As I stood stripped of clothes and spread plain from floor to hands, I wondered why my introduction to prison had not yet produced a metamorphosis of spirit or a thought more profound in me than a concern for my now exposed member.<br/><br/>""Bottoms of your feet.  Show left foot.  Down.  Same thing right foot.  Down.""<br/><br/>If I was expected to give up everything -- money, family, friends, reputation and freedom -- I wanted it to be in exchange for one of those life-changing moments you see in movies or hear about in interviews with Oprah: a moment that so overwhelms you that you can't help but pledge to God, yourself or whomever that things would now be different – that I would become a new and better person. <br/><br/>""One step back.  Bend at the middle.  Touch your toes.  Hold.  Ok, up.""<br/><br/>But it never came.<br/><br/>Any moment I had was dominated by the embarrassment of my condition and any self-awareness never extended beyond the flesh between my legs.  Not one of my better trades, I had to admit.  Before I could mark the result against a mental ledger, my thoughts were broken by the thump of clothes, balled-up and dropped hard against the back of my heels in time with the delivery of another set of instructions.<br/><br/>""Turn around. Put those on. Wait.""<br/><br/>That sounded about right, I told myself sarcastically.  I wasn't prepared to have my first act of defiance within the Federal Penitentiary system be a refusal to stop being naked in a room filled tight with a dozen correctional officers and a near equal number of men sharing my condition.  Eager to get to the waiting part of the directions as soon as possible, I shot an arm deep into the pile of clothes at my feet, grabbed some paper-thin blue boxer shorts and hurriedly dressed before pulling on a pair of lint-covered white socks -- all the while balancing on alternating legs to facilitate the process.<br/><br/>The next item to hand was an unusually large orange T-shirt, faded and stretched loose through what I suspect were multiple wearing and washing.  Before giving too much consideration to the implications of the shirt's less than ""gently used"" state on the underwear now on my skin, I drew it over my head and, after feeling its edge drop past my thighs to just above the knees, hoped for a better fit from what remained. Other than what looked like nondescript blue deck-shoes traced at their toe and sides with white rubber casing, the final piece of my ensemble was another version of the heavy denim orange jumpsuit I had worn in Provincial jail prior to my transfer to the Federal system -- this time as clean an outfit of that type and color as I could imagine save for the ""4X"" stained into the cuff of each leg and the collection of loose threads caught in the tired strip of Velcro running from its neck to inseam.  As I wrestled the stiff garment around my shoes and up and over my frame, the large brown-skinned officer charged with my processing looked away from the screen that had held his attention since my arrival and asked, ""This your first Penitentiary bit?"" <br/><br/>Was it that obvious, I wondered?  ""Yes sir, it is. My first time ever in prison.   I mean, first time other than the jail I just came from after sentencing to here sir. Yes, first time.""<br/><br/>""I figured as much,"" he said, directing a glance at the kit of rolled-up towels, linens and fabric still on the floor in front of me. ""Cuz you're trying to seal up your jumper without first putting on a second pair of underpants.""<br/><br/>Second pair? The confusion on my face must alone have requested an explanation because he continued as if in response.  ""Yeah, I know it's kinda queer, but these ranges are obsessed with not showing or seeing a guy's junk.  So: two sets of underwear on all the time outside your House, including showers. Go to it.""<br/><br/>Including showers? What? Are you serious?  ""Yes sir. Thank you, sir"" I said instead before I tore open my uniform's seam in time with a move lower for a pair of boxers that looked to have also surrendered their original colour and form long ago.  If this was a practical joke at my expense, I could think of worse; and, if it wasn’t, my research in preparation for prison had obviously not been as complete as I assumed. Worrying about wearing an extra set of underwear bunched below my midriff or how many men had already worn them did not make much sense considering with what else I had to concern myself.  I slipped into the second pair and, after a quick glance to see if any guards were looking and laughing in my direction -- they were not -- re-entered the legs of my jumper before draping the outfit over my arms and shoulders and running an open hand along my chest to twin-up its front.<br/> <br/>With my prison attire now seemingly as it should be, I stooped over to collect what of mine remained on the floor, straightened, and then stood quietly in anticipation of the next order, instruction, or word of advice.<br/> <br/>""Good, good, that's a better start,"" the guard said, leaning against the desk between us, his fingers clicking at a computer's keyboard. ""But before I get to what I've gotta do to move you over, can you answer something?"" <br/><br/>""Yes sir,"" I said faintly as I suddenly felt my chest constrict with the realization of where I was and where I was going to be for the next few months of my life.  I took a deep breath to compensate.<br/><br/>“It says here you're receiving a sentence of three and three for fraud over. What kind of fraud gets a first-timer a Federal sentence that requires you to spend the ninety-day assessment part of your stretch in a maximum-security institution?”  He questioned, before adding an authoritative “Hmm?"" to make certain I would answer on cue.<br/><br/>""Insider trading, sir. Its stock market related."" I said before waving a hand in the direction of his computer and continuing. ""As your files probably show somewhere, I made a great deal of money from more than a hundred separate illegal insider trading deals over a fifteen-or-so year period in Canada and the United States tha ..."" My voice thinned and then trailed quiet before breaking off entirely.<br/><br/>The officer, appreciating my hesitation to speak further and perhaps seeing the same uninvited glances that I felt at my back, directed me closer with an upturned finger held bent at its tip like a hook calling for a worm and coolly asked, ""I know why you might not, believe me I do, but I need you to tell how much money was involved?  It might be useful for your processing and where you end up here and afterward.""<br/><br/>I turned my head to look over one shoulder and then the other before responding in what I hoped was a more circumspect half-whisper, ""Sure. Umm, no-one is really certain because of how long my partner and I did it and the lack of records and what documents we destroyed after we found out the government was on to us, but for the sake of negotiating a deal between my lawyers and prosecutors and regulators on both sides of the border, everyone agreed to use the figure of more than twenty million dollars ... American.""<br/><br/>""How much more than twenty million?"" he asked without hesitation.<br/><br/>""Like I said no-one knows for certain -- not even me ... honestly. Since prosecutors couldn't pin it down to an exact number they just arbitrarily picked a level that was high enough for them to meet certain sentencing guidelines, but not so high that those guidelines would make the plea deal they wanted impossible. It could have been much higher and much worse really, so I was happy with what they picked … relatively speaking I mean about the happy part.""<br/><br/>""I understand,"" he said in a way that I was fairly certain he did not.   As the sound of one guard and then another and then another cursing at someone behind to stop resisting pushed into my ear, I decided that placating the person charged with my processing was not too high a price to pay to keep him from that chorus.<br/><br/>""So I guess this things been in the news recently?"" He speculated.<br/><br/>""Yes sir, you're right, a lot I'm sure,"" I said. “Probably on television the morning I was sentenced and entered jail about a week ago and certainly on the front page of every business section in North America later that day or the next.”<br/><br/>After a moment of contemplation, the officer straightened his body with a push from his desk and said, “Yah, now I see why you came here from Protective Custody.  Stay put and don't move 'cuz I need to talk to my supervisor for few secs'.  If you were on the News and it involved that kind of money, guys that transported up with you from the Bucket are sure to have enough to pass around.  Good chance that kind of beef will get you pieced-off pretty quick in Gen Pop.  Alright?”<br/><br/>Alright? No, definitely not alright.  I didn’t need a complete understanding of prison slang to know that “Gen Pop” meant General Population and that “pieced off” in any context, especially one involving prison, didn't sound very appealing.  If he was worried about me being extorted or threatened by inmates that knew about my conviction or ""beef,"" I'm sure their efforts wouldn't be any less if it was also reported that the entirety of my assets had been confiscated under a worldwide seizure order executed by two governments and an assortment of self-interested bureaucracies.<br/><br/>""Thank you sir,"" I replied respectfully before seeing him turn and walk along the wall behind his desk to the first open door on his left.  Accepting the judgment of this officer while hoping for the best seemed like the only course of action for me to take. I decided to mark time from his departure not in his offered secs or seconds but in how many voices I could identify in the room without turning around.  I believe I counted thirteen before he returned carrying a cellophane bag filled with what looked like toiletries and in the company of an older, officious-looking man with grey hair capping a tight, angry Irish face.<br/><br/>“This is Mr. Donnelly.  He's in charge of placements here at Millhaven Assessment Unit,"" the guard said as he handed me the plastic bag without comment while turning in deference toward a bespectacled man wearing a military-dress white shirt stepping aggressively forward in front of the desk to within what I and most would consider an uncomfortable distance from my face.<br/><br/>“You probably think your shit don't stink being a lawyer and all, but there's no Protective Custody here in Millhaven proper or anywhere else in the Federal Penitentiary system,"" snapped Mr. Donnelly.  ""We don't have P.C. for any white-collars regardless of what you may have been told above.  What we do offer at M.A.U. is the Special Needs and it normally houses Max inmates from outside the Assessment Unit on usually a short-term basis plus newcomers like you shipped down from the Bucket for processing and assignment,” he barked before drawing his lips back against his teeth high at the gum-line like a steel trap that had just been sprung by the move of his hands akimbo to his hips.<br/><br/>I remembered someone from jail mentioning Special Needs as the place that I wanted to be in the Pen (Or was it not be?) because of the increased access to a payphone that it provided (Daily for twenty minutes rather than every second day for ten?), so I looked at him in a way that indicated that I was resigned to my fate and whatever he wanted to do with me.<br/><br/>“There’s one space left in Range 2B, but don’t take it as any guarantee that what might happen in Gen Pop won’t also reach you in Special Needs.  Last I looked, 2B’s got a collection of max-time guys with “incompatibles” in other parts of the Institution, a few “skinners"" and ""diddlers,” some “deadbeats” laying low, a handful of others and – if you sign-off -- you for the next three months before you get shipped to probably a Min-Mother Institution to serve the rest of your sentence,” he offered.<br/><br/>“Yes sir, I’ll accept it sir,” I said eagerly while not completely clear about the terms being applied to my future “rangemates?” or why my consent was even required.  I was so exhausted from my transfer and the stress associated with the day's now five-hour-and-counting ordeal of moving from jail to prison that any box with a bed would be a blessing and if it was one that also allowed me daily access to the phone or that satisfied any other “special needs” I might have the more the better.<br/><br/>""Very well then.  Officer, get this offender signed-up and lined-up for Special Needs,"" ordered Mr. Donnelly before he surprised me by stepping out of character, leaning into my ear, and saying ""And good luck to you sir"" and then marching back to and through the doorway from whence he came.<br/><br/>After holding his eyes on Mr. Donnelly until he had turned the corner and completely receded from view, the guard paused for a long moment before looking back to me and continuing.  ""Ok then, I guess that's the way it's going to be.  Just sign right there if you want to consent to the Special Needs Unit,"" he advised while offering me his pen for use over the signature line of a sheet of paper that was distinctive for being the only one of legal-size on his desk, ""and I can get you set up.""<br/><br/>I pulled the pen from his hand, conscious of not allowing our fingers to touch during the exchange, and used it to place my mark where instructed without actually focusing my eyes on the page so as not to inadvertently read or even acknowledge a single word typed upon it.  Being completely trusting and removing any pretense of having control over my fate gave me a sense of contentment.  It was the same attitude I adopted in the past to avoid feeling stress when stuck in traffic or in a line at a store's check-out.  If the situation was beyond my control it was simply beyond my control and it wouldn't be any less so by my worrying about what would happen next, what I could do about it, or when things would change.<br/><br/>After answering a few perfunctory questions that included whether I had used explosives in the commission of my offence (I knew he didn't understand my charges!) and if I had any gang affiliations or criminal associations, he instructed me to look at the small camera affixed to the back of his computer's monitor and not blink.  I heard a click.  ""Ok, that's done.  Stay right here,"" he again ordered before stepping toward and into the same room from which he had pulled Mr. Donnelly earlier.  After a moment brief enough that I hadn't had time to remember to distract myself by counting the number of unique voices around me, he returned carrying two plastic cards -- one in each hand as if trying to honour the separate sources that had delivered them to his care.<br/><br/>""This one is your Photo-ID card,"" he said as he leaned slightly over his desk to describe the clear plastic square in his left hand laminating a card that held a stamp-sized picture of me along with my name in big, blue block letters, the Canadian flag, and details on the back about my height, weight, complexion, and date of birth.  The plastic coating on one end of the card was extended and teased into a loop that loosely encircled a small, silver-coloured metal shirt-clip.   ""It has your picture as you see and your FPS or Finger Print System number below it.  You need to show this card to pick up mail marked as privileged if you're called down to Security for that or to attend at Medical or for movement really anywhere outside of this room or your range.  Ok?""<br/><br/>""Ok,"" I quickly affirmed. <br/><br/>""This other white one,"" he continued after dropping my Photo-ID to his desk and bringing forward an all-white plastic card that had the look and shape of a credit card, save for a fingernail's-width wide rectangular hole at its base, ""is for your inmate phone privileges.  If you don't already know which you probably don't, you can't make a call on the payphones in prison without first inserting this card and then typing the FPS number I just told you about.   The clip hanging from the ID is what guy's use to keep both cards together to help out if they forget their phone card since there's nothing visible on it to identify it as yours.  It's also good for reserving a call when you're next-in-line by putting the ID card of the pair on top of the phone near the receptacle. You'll see how it works soon enough upstairs or in yard so don't worry.""<br/><br/>""Thank you,"" I said -- full of worry -- as I took the white card from his hand and adjusted it to allow me to pinch and push the clip from the Photo-ID through its opening before slipping the combination into a front pocket.  ""Oh, sorry, I forgot, is that ok putting it away?"" I asked as I turned my body to push forward the hip pocket that now held both cards.<br/><br/>""Yah, sure, keep it in there if you want,"" he said with a mix of indifference and irritation.  ""Like I said, you just have to have your ID with you when you're walking around.  No need to clip it on your chest or anything like that for obvious reasons.""<br/><br/>""Sorry?""<br/><br/>""You know, obvious reasons for someone like yourself like not wanting to walk around and advertise a name that anyone in a phone call to the outside world could ask to have Googled,"" he answered.<br/><br/>""Yes, thank you, that makes sense,"" I said, letting go of the cards in my pocket and pulling out an empty hand to place back at my side.<br/><br/>""Now that we're good, bring your linens and that bag I gave you and come with me to holding where you were dropped-off when you came in,"" he said as he directed me with a point and turn of his hand to step to my right and walk around the privacy wall at my back and ahead a dozen paces to a caged-in area that held me when I first arrived, then in shackles from the transport van and jail before.  I moved as instructed, but on reaching the holding cell I stopped short of its door and stepped to the side -- ostensibly to allow the guard following behind to open it.  Instead, and likely in deference to protocol and position, he stayed at my back scolding, ""Don't just stand there!  Slide that rod handle over and take an empty spot on the benches with the others.""<br/><br/>""Sure thing ... BOSS,"" I said sarcastically, now more concerned with the opinion of ""the others"" in front of me than his from behind.<br/><br/>""You guys gonna get food in a minute.  No movement until we're done serving the ranges upstairs,"" the guard yelled through me to the men inside.<br/><br/>I grabbed the metal bar that kept the door closed rather than locked and forced it over before drawing open the cage.  The enclosure was what you would imagine a chicken coop would look like if increased in size to limit the movement of men rather than chickens to no more than a step or two and if its wire was replaced with thick metal fencing traced up a dozen feet around the perimeter and then above and over to cover those within.  Aluminum benches were secured to the floor along two of its sides and backed to an open area containing a lidless bowl and a stainless steel sink assembly similar to what would be found in the lavatory of an airplane (granted, a menacing-looking airplane) but without a mirror or the pretense of cleanliness.  The floor was lacquered concrete and distinctive only for how moist and slick with grime its surface looked without actually being wet and for a drain recessed into the room's centre that appeared to be covered in a melange of mold, hair and scraps of multi-coloured paper.<br/><br/>Three inmates were already inside.  The two seated to my right looked up for a moment as if to try and place my face, but without success.  The closest of the pair was a short muscular black man of about twenty, his hair worked into cornrows and tailing-off to just past the collar of his jumper and a raised scar under his chin.  The other, a decade or so older, was of Native descent and in possession of an almost comically-large barrel chest and abdomen, his girth made all the more impressive by how thin his arms, legs, and head looked extending from that massive core.  The last of the three, nearly larger than the other two combined, was sprawled alone over the opposite bench with his eyes closed and head resting on a roll of toilet paper like some tiny make-shift pillow.  Of the three, he was the only one that I had seen before and knew for certain would be a danger.<br/><br/>My path crossed that of the large sleeping man a week ago at the Don Jail with his arrival -- as opposed to mine -- being met with a genuine sense of excitement and ebullience from the inmates on my range.  Upon entering the Don, Bear, as he was called, made it known that he had ""packed"" for his arrest and, as a result, was bringing in more heroin to sell and share than he had ever done before.  By packed, of course, I mean shoved drugs encased in containers euphemistically called ""eggs"" deep into his rectum and beyond the inspection or reach of guards.  Bear's smuggling efforts were not so much motivated by his addiction (which was apparently the stuff of legend and in some way tied with his size to his nickname) as self-preservation:  He had been marked for death on the street and needed the drugs that he carried inside -- literally deep inside -- to buy the protections and favour of those in prison that could provide it.  Needless to say, I was not among that number. <br/><br/>From what I knew of him, Bear was an addict and life-time violent criminal that fell into the habit of robbing drug dealers for their supplies.  The robbery that got him into trouble, or more trouble than he expected, involved breaking into a drug den with two accomplices, beating everyone inside to near death with baseball bats, and then running the den as his own for the day by selling the drugs that he could not use or carry to the dealer's regular customers coming to the door.  The aforementioned near-beaten-to-death dealer did not take the theft and assault on her person terribly well as evidenced by the murder of Bear's accomplices by way of ""hot shots"" of pure heroin stabbed into their necks shortly thereafter.  Knowing that he was likely to be killed by overdose or something worse, Bear decided that prudence dictated that he get arrested and incarcerated and off the streets until something was either worked out or done with or to the dealer.<br/><br/>To get to the relative ""safety"" of jail, Bear proceeded to pack his backside with what remained of the stolen heroin before robbing a nearby pharmacy -- all with the intention of getting caught.  The story I heard involves him sitting outside the pharmacy's doors waiting to be arrested while casually popping and swallowing the pills he had just purloined.  Unfortunately for Bear, the police arrived sooner than expected -- or at least before he had finished consuming what he wanted to consume -- forcing him to get up and run into the street between cars shoving pill after pill into his mouth as he fled.   The chase continued until either all the pills were gone or Bear got tired of running or more likely just tired of cutting his mouth on the aluminum foil covering the blister packs he was biting open as he ran.<br/><br/>I apologize for not being able to do a retelling justice.  I remember laughing quite hard (albeit to myself) when over-hearing the story because I pictured this tattooed, thick-bodied Frankenstein-like monster slow-running from the police in a way that would buy him some time; but, not so much of it as to result in either actual escape or the involuntary escape of a heroin-filled bag from his anus.  Even seeing him lying in front of me with his lips still all cut up from chewing into aluminum, I didn't feel much like laughing considering the intake officer's caution against inmates following me from jail and my eventually getting ""pieced-off"" in the penitentiary because of it.<br/><br/>An analogy to hibernation probably sounds forced, but my chances would be better if this Bear slept through dinner and then kept sleeping until I moved to Special Needs and beyond.<br/><br/>****<br/>Oscar Wilde, the author of ""An Ideal Husband"" (a play that contained one of the first literary references to insider trading), in commenting on his own imprisonment in a letter to the Daily Chronicle in 1897, wrote, ""Prisoners are, as a class, extremely sympathetic to each other.  Suffering and the community of suffering makes people kind.""  Here's hoping.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>In tune with the closing of a metal gate behind, the whir of unseen pullies within the walls worked to slide aside an identical black barrier to my front.  Greeting me at the entrance to Range 2B of the Special Needs Unit was a man near my age and dressed in similar orange garb to my own; but, in possession of physical attributes that could only come from years of exercising in environments limited by space -- but not time.  Holding out his hand I could see that he carried squared raised shoulders that likely grew from endless push-ups on a cell floor, a wide stern the consequence of tens of thousands of back dips against a bed; and, hard red raised knuckles that I assume grew calloused from repeatedly punching the walls of his cell and not new inmates delivered into his charge on the range.  He was what back in jail would be called ""prison strong.""   <br/><br/>""I go by Cowboy.  I'm the Cleaner,"" he said shaking my hand firmly.<br/><br/>""Name's Stan.  Hey,"" I responded directly and in a tone matched to his.<br/><br/>""Being Cleaner means my box is open all day except when it ain't.  If you need toilet paper or the mop or something when you're out for showers ya come to me,"" he explained matter-of-factly as if he had said the same hundreds of times to hundreds of others before.  ""Word to the wise:  Don't let me catch you cracking to the guards back in the Bubble or when they're doing walkthroughs -- you speak to me with what ya got and I'll relay it to whoever needs to hear it.  Comprende?""<br/><br/>""I understand Cowboy,"" I said before looking back over my shoulder almost longingly to the ""Bubble,"" a Plexiglas enclosed guard station behind two gates and at the centre of the stairwell outside the range.<br/><br/>""Best be,"" he snapped, making a fist for what I hoped was only affect.  ""I'm doing my Pen bit here -- ain't just passing through for assessment like you and almost everybody else.  Even with it being Special Needs I got a solid range going on, so if anyone sees you cracking to a C.O. they're going to think the worst of it because they know I tell that same shit to everybody.  You feelin me on this newfish?""<br/><br/>""I do.  I understand.  If I need anything from the guards I should go to you first,"" I summarized while nodding my head dramatically for anyone else watching to see.<br/><br/>""Not just first -- only.  Ya got boxed into 217.  Let's go,"" he said before he gave me a look to follow, turned and started ahead.<br/><br/>Range 2B was marked by a row of cells on each side of a long, wide hallway with no evidence of guards beyond those that I knew existed outside the gates at my back. Unlike jail where the cells were barred, here the doors were solid slabs of metal akin to bank vaults but painted in alternating colours of red, blue, and green, with an envelope-size window near their top at eye level and a rectangular slot at their centre, big enough to pass a food-tray through when unlocked.  At the head of the hallway were a pair of payphones, each affixed to the wall and adjacent to one of two doorless cells that appeared to have been refurbished on-the-cheap to allow for their use as showers.   Ahead at the centre of the range was a small table about the size of a school-desk on which a toaster and a commercial-grade hot water pot sat along with a pile of sliced white bread on a brown paper towel and a yellow-stained tube that looked like the barrel of a large syringe that had been split at its seam.  Probably because my senses were heightened by fear, everything seemed bright and alive to me, but still somewhat unreal -- almost like I was watching a 3-D movie from within.  As I trailed Cowboy I thought about pulling my back straight and flexing the muscles of my chest to look tough for my new audience, but that idea grew weak as soon as I was able to make out the jackal-like shouts coming from the cells at my sides.<br/><br/>""That's him.  That's the guy! That's the guy!"" I heard howled from face after face pushing against the reinforced-glass of each window that I passed.  With every step deeper into the range and every shout that I heard, panic grew in my gut like a meal I couldn't digest.  How do these inmates know me and why are they so angry?  Why do they even care about my arrival?  I can't believe my crime of insider trading is notorious enough to merit this kind of outrage and attention, particularly on a form of protective custody range that probably has and certainly has seen more than a few rapists and child murderers.  It doesn't make any sense,"" I felt my lips mouth.<br/><br/>""No need to be shaking it rough,"" Cowboy shouted back at me dismissively as if he'd heard my thoughts.  ""We yell that shit at everybody as they come in.  Sort of our thing on this range so that guys deservin' of it don't stand out from everyone else.  Doesn't mean anything.  Just jokes.""<br/><br/>""Just jokes.  Very funny,"" I commented flatly at Cowboy's back as I continued to follow him through the comedic din that now surrounded us and toward a cell ahead and to our left that I could see opening in time with my arrival.<br/><br/>""Welcome home,"" Cowboy sneered as he stopped and turned to funnel me with his body to its entrance.  ""Your cellie's Murd--""<br/><br/>""George!  Tell 'em to call me George.""  I heard a voice inside cut him off sharply.<br/><br/>""George? Ok, whatever, Geooorge,"" Cowboy said as he drew out the name, punctuating it with a laugh. ""Get in there with I guess Geooorge so the Bubble can lock all your asses up.""<br/><br/>I stepped forward cautiously, passing through the opening just before the red-painted steel cell-door slid shut and clanked behind.  Staring at me was my new cell-mate, a stocky and pale biker-type with longish unkempt black hair and a thistle-bush of a beard, heavy-set and shirtless and sitting on the bottom bunk, wearing nothing but shower sandals and boxer shorts and ink-blue tattoos on his bare chest, arms, and neck and a disdainful look on his face like a man watching a bus he missed pull away.  I stared back wordlessly for a long moment to allow him to speak before finally breaking the awkward quiet by dropping my bag and belongings on the top bunk and introducing myself as Stan.<br/><br/>""What the fuck do you think you're doing putting that shit up there?"" He roared back after my name, head forward and nostrils flaring, black eyes fixed on me with loathing, his lips set in a tight line.<br/><br/>""Sorry, I just thought my bunk was on top since it was empty and you didn't say anything."" I explained apologetically, hurriedly pulling down my belongings from the bed and dropping them to my sides.<br/><br/>""Then you shoulda fuckin' asked!  I can be wherever the fuck I want in my house.  Put your shit on and under the bottom bunk.  Top and everything else is mine,"" he bellowed loudly as if wanting to be heard by both me and everyone outside our cell.<br/><br/>""Again, look, I'm sorry, no disrespect intended,"" I explained plaintively, raising my hands up along my sides to just above my shoulders with palms open like the victim of a stick-up.  ""I assumed that since you were on the bottom that was your spot.  My mistake.  Sorry.  No need for us to get off to a bad start.""<br/><br/>Out of an equal measure of deference and confusion I glimpsed down and away from the wild-eyed stare he held on me.  What I saw before bringing my attention back in the most non-threatening manner I could muster was a closet-sized room with beige-painted walls, dirty and cracked or cracking white plastic tiles, a set of bunks, a metal desk and metal sink assembly and nothing much else but a portable TV resting on a short ledge at right angle to the toilet.<br/><br/>George greeted the return of my eyes by cocking his head like a cobra and slowly drawing his tongue out, draping it between his teeth and lower lip, and then quickly pulling it back to create a smacking sound with his mouth, almost like a bizarre duck call -- Swack!.<br/><br/>Is this normal in prison?  Am I supposed to know what that means?  I rummaged through my mind and my limited experiences from jail for an explanation, but couldn't find one to bring sense to what he was doing.<br/><br/>Swack!  The sound echoed wet inside his mouth and then once more against the metal walls of the cell like a rumble.  Before I could attempt to give meaning to the release of a third ""swack,"" George bolted up straight and lunged towards me fast with a muscled and painted fore-arm at the lead.  I felt my knees buckle and my eyes grow wide, ready to be struck by a punch yet undelivered.  But with a sort of self-satisfied grin, George abruptly stopped his advance -- inertia and all -- threw his head back and laughed like someone that found everything amusing before he lowered his arms and offered a hand for me to shake. As we did -- his grip suffocating in strength and unnaturally moist -- he sniggered while embracing my shoulder like a long-lost friend, ""Us? Yah, no need for US to get off to a bad start.  We can be buddies, huh new guy?"" <br/><br/>What his pronouncement appeared to be lacking in sincerity and context, it more than made up for in being what I wanted to hear.  Maybe everyone in 2B was just a bad comedian waiting to get out, I imagined, and not a cruel sociopath.  Maybe.<br/><br/>""Great.  That would be great,"" I replied weakly, still expecting bad news to break at any moment.<br/><br/>Shuffling around him haltingly with my bag and linens now in hand and toward the window at the back wall and our bunks to its right, I tossed my belongings on and under the bed as he had directed and took a longer look at my new home. A big metal desk (but no chair) crowded near my bed and, when lying down, I speculated that my toes would be over its end and no more than a half-leg again away from the door. The room was about eight by ten feet in size and offered maybe ten square feet in total floor space outside the beds, desk, sink and toilet to move around -- less so if George was occupying the middle of it as he was now.<br/><br/>""In that bag the coppers gave ya coming in there's a plastic pill bottle with a red sticker on it.  It'll have bleach to clean your works if you're a shooter.""  George said confidently, pointing at the jumble of contents that I had just dropped on the bed.<br/><br/>""I won't need that.  I don't do any drugs,"" I responded quickly.<br/><br/>""Yah, about that:  I don't care.  I'm telling ya cuz yer gonna use the bleach to clean this cell,"" he explained curtly.  ""New guys gotta do it coming in.  Range-rule.""<br/><br/>At that moment I was not inclined to argue the fairness of a rule that required me to clean something that I had no involvement in making dirty, even with someone who was apparently my ""Buddy.""  ""Sounds fair,"" I rationalized instead.  ""I was going to do it anyway,"" I continued, ""but I'm glad you told me about the Range-rule.  I was a bit worried that my cleaning might cause offence by looking like a judgment on your cleanliness or how the room smells (dry, acidic, and sickly sweet, I didn't add).""<br/><br/>""If you think cleaning a cell could offend someone, you're fucked,"" George spat out in a way that the word ""fucked"" sounded like it was comprised of three syllables. ""With brain-work like that this has gotta be your first time down below,"" he snorted.<br/><br/>""In prison? Yes, yes it is.  I've been getting that a lot today as you can imagine.  Must be something about my face or how my brain works,"" I laughed nervously, repeating his phrase back to him as I pulled a wash-cloth out of the plastic bag on my bed.  ""I'll get to cleaning now,"" I said briskly hoping that he would approve of my efforts and not object to my turning away from him and further questions about my history that I didn't want to answer.<br/><br/>The sink seemed as good a place to start as any.  It was cleaner than I expected and sat atop an enclosed solid stainless steel column extending to the floor and connected to the toilet by piping at its rear.  Protruding from a flap above its crest and against the wall were three identical unlabeled metal buttons the size and shape of toothpaste caps.  Through experimentation, I learned that pushing the first provided hot water for exactly three seconds before shutting off until pushed again, the second cold for near double that time, and that a firm push of the third caused the toilet to flush very loudly and for a lot longer than anyone would expect.  In the basin's bottom, George, or whomever, had jammed a travel-size stick of deodorant to infuse the room when water drained over it.<br/><br/>Pasted above the sink with dried toothpaste was a shiny sheet of foil that served as a mirror, albeit one that was hazy and, with the distortions it reflected, more fitting for a funhouse than a jailhouse.  To its left, and nearer to the toilet than the sink, was another button, this about the size of a silver dollar and raised only slightly so that it was near flush with the wall.  Written above the button in black, block letters were the words, ""WARNING:  PUSH ONLY IN EMERGENCY.""<br/><br/>George must have followed the path of my eyes because as soon as I had finished reading the word EMERGENCY he reached across my chest and pushed the button into the wall with a thumb.  With mouth agape, I turned to him wondering what just happened.<br/><br/>""Did that ... uhh set off an alarm or something?"" I questioned timidly while the inner me fought back the urge to scream ""Why the hell did you do that you idiot!?""<br/><br/>""No alarm we can hear when its pushed, but something goes off in the Bubble,"" George explained calmly. ""Guards are supposed to respond like it’s an Emergency because you could be having a heart attack from the stress of moving in or something or I could be killing you in here for all they know.  Whether they come and when they come ... Aah,"" he Kanye-shrugged, indifferent to my anxiety. <br/><br/>What kind of bi-polar maniac was I put in a cell with?  There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to his actions.  Unpredictability, as I was counseled by the older inmates with whom I played cards in the Bucket, can be an effective defensive strategy to adopt in both prison and poker; but, George just came across as crazy and dangerous.  Or maybe that was the point:  If I didn't have to share a cell with him, I'd certainly avoid George as much as I could.  But I did ... and I couldn't.<br/><br/>""Just keep cleaning and don't think about the button other than what time it was when you pushed it,"" George instructed curiously.  ""Something else needs doing,"" he continued as he reached into his pocket like it was the drive-thru window of a fast-food restaurant and pulled out three plastic packs of ketchup.  Arranging them in his right hand between his thumb and fore-finger, he brought the packs together at one end and tore them open with a single bite of his teeth.  Without explanation, he squeezed their viscous contents into the palm of his left hand and then flicked the clump of empty ketchup-covered shells past my face and into the toilet.  I didn't know what to say in response, but before that became obvious to both of us George moved to the desk, raised his right knee like a Olympic hurdler, stepped up and upon its top, and straightened his lead leg above with a grunt and the help of a forceful jump-hop from his other below.   In the face of such a bizarre spectacle, his attribution about who had pushed the button did not seem worth challenging.<br/><br/>Standing on the desk and balancing on his toes to stretch out his frame above it, George brought a crimson covered hand up to the light fixture at the ceiling and carefully massaged ketchup over and around the single dark bulb at its centre.  ""This middle bulb is called a guard-light and it goes off red every hour when the pigs come by for their walk-throughs,"" he explained.  ""No big deal during the day, but at night the light is so fuckin' bright it'll cut you awake.  Since we can't break it out or cover it with toilet paper, all we got left is to slime it with ketchup,"" he said, continuing to paint the bulb thick with delicate brushes of an open palm.  ""Being red the ketchup doesn't look so noticeable when the light is off, but when it's on it blocks a lot of the fuckin' glare,"" he said, finishing the job through breaths heavy with his weight and the extension of an arm high above his head.<br/><br/>After transferring as much ketchup from his hand to the bulb as looked possible, George bent his knees to squat low before jumping from the desk with a bounce off the floor, only steadying himself with a single touch of a clean palm against the bunks.   Holding his ketchup-covered hand by his ear, he moved to wedge me out from in front of the sink before running the water to wash himself clean of the scarlet goo. After shaking the wet from his fingers, he wiped them dry on his backside and returned to the desk to sit with a plop on the corner closest to the window and farthest from the door.  ""You can go back to cleaning the sink now,"" he said.  ""Looks like it needs it and I want you around the shitter when they come in.""<br/><br/>They? Oh, yes, the Emergency Button.  With that, I heard the clank of the gate opening at the entrance to the range and the fizz of electricity before the condiment covered bulb above flickered on, blanketing the room in an eerie red glow.  George lifted his chin, now illuminated in red like everything else, and leaned back on his hands to better see the result of his efforts.  Not having experienced the ruby brightness of the light before his handy-work, I was more impressed by how quickly the smell of heated ketchup filled our surroundings than how less or more red the light now looked.  After hearing footsteps assemble outside the cell, our door slid open with the clangor and shake of metal against metal to reveal three correctional officers dressed in standard blue prison fatigues in the middle of the hall-way.  The guard closest to the entrance was the same correctional officer that had frisked me earlier in the Bubble before delivering me to Cowboy on the range.<br/><br/>""What's the emergency?"" he asked sternly, adjusting the fingers on his leather gloves as he spoke.<br/><br/>""New guy was cleaning around the toilet and hit the E-button by accident,"" George lied leaning to his side to look out the door while jerking an incriminating thumb in my direction.<br/> <br/>""Is that right Gurmoosky?"" the guard asked, studying me warily as I stood in front of our bunks with a cloth bunched in one hand and pill container filled with bleach in the other.  I ignored the mispronunciation of my name and replied with a quick affirmative nod before looking away and stepping to the sink.  A prudent decision, I concluded, with Cowboy's warning against speaking to the guards still in my head and George this night set to be sleeping just outside and above it.<br/><br/>""Tower!  2B! Looock it up!"" the officer shouted without pause down the range and with an unnecessary flourish.  With that, the red guard-light that announced their arrival went dark and the door began to close.  As soon as the latch clanked shut, I moved forward to look out the window and saw that all three guards had already walked past its limits and out of view.  Emergency over. I was alone again.<br/><br/>""He ... looked ... pissed!"" George laughed as the ripples of fat on his stomach, pale as milk, twisted and folded on each other, mocking me like grins. ""Sure to take a lot longer for the next emergency now that you're considered accident prone,"" he advised with a dark smile, making clear the point of the entire exercise.<br/><br/>""Come on George, please, it's too much.  I don't wanna play these games.  I've had a long day and I just want to do my time in Assessment and move on,"" I said with a tone of frustration that coming from someone else might have bordered on the confrontational.<br/><br/>""And what would that be?  What would you be doing time for in Assessment?"" George questioned aggressively as if I had somehow breached prison protocol leaving the subject open for him to investigate.<br/><br/>""It doesn't matter what I did,"" I replied dismissively.  ""All I want is to do my time as uneventfully as possible and that means I'm not going to bother you if you don't bother me.""<br/><br/>""I guarantee that you're not goin' to fuckin' bother me.  Not in my fuckin' house,"" George said forcefully, arching his arms back and leaning forward.  ""And it does fuckin' matter!  I'm not sharing a cell with some diddler or skinner and have that beef come back on my reputation for not doing anything about it.""  He moved a step closer.<br/><br/>""Listen George, I'm not a diddler or a rape-hound or a rat or a bug or a bird or a box-thief or a hammerhawk or a goof or a poof or whatever the hell other prison word you are worried about applying to me,"" I exclaimed with growing vigor as the anger that had coiled inside me since my sentencing sprung loose with defiance (and maybe recklessness?).  And now, I thought to myself, for the ultimate prison-sanctioned ""coup de grace"" to end the dispute in my favour:  ""Just do your own fuckin' time, George!  Just do your own fuckin' time!"" I yelled.<br/><br/>In jail I was taught that ""just do your own time"" was what you said when you wanted to remind others that their behaviour or choices in prison shouldn't impact upon you.  For example, if I wanted to watch television I should only watch it while wearing headphones so that no one else would have to share in my experience or ""do my time with me.""  Similarly, if I needed to use the toilet I should wait until either my cellmate was at yard or given sufficient notice to grab some air from the window or the crack at the door.  And, even with that, flushing constantly was expected and certainly ""whenever a turd started to turtle.""   In short, ""just do your own time"" was a demand to adhere to a code that dictated that how you choose to serve your sentence shouldn't impact on how I choose to serve mine.  Or at least that's what I was told I should say if I wanted to garner the respect of inmates in prison.<br/><br/>""Firstly, it’s 'do your own time,' not 'just do your own fuckin' time,'"" George corrected quietly through a graveled whisper.  ""Secondly or lastly ..."" If he said another word after that I didn't hear it as he rushed toward me like a storm, barreling me with a shoulder into the narrow corner at the centre of the cell, my lower-back broken over a short shelf jutting from the wall.  As my legs gave way to the shock, my body slid lower until it was caught by an elbow that George pressed up and under my chin, wedging my head hard against the ledge behind. <br/><br/>""Help,"" I cried to rescuers unseen, hoping that I had thrown out a hand toward the Emergency Button on my fall backwards and not just imagined the effort.  Blood, trapped and growing heavy in my head, filled my ears with white-noise.  His forearm, corded with muscle and intent, held my neck and head still with a sinewy crackle. ""What's your beef?  What the fuck you in for?"" he yelled down to me, rabid spittle raining into my eyes.<br/><br/>""Ima .. Ima inside trader,"" I forced out breathlessly in surrender.  ""Look at my papers .... my A4 ... D ...  My papers  ... Ima ... inside trader.  Don't!""  I begged through gasps, tears offered by my eyes like ransom.<br/><br/>""Hmm ... maybe we can work something out,"" I thought I heard George say before my world went dark and I reached out for the smell of caramelized ketchup as if it were a blanket.<br/></p>

Almost every financial book that I have read has either provided little practical advice toward creating and protecting real wealth or has been terribly dull and uninspiring.
I want to use my experience as someone that engaged in illegal insider trading for nearly 15 years and in over 100 separate deals to form the basis of a novel that conveys real-world financial advice to the reader through the retelling of the conversations and relationship I had with my Maximum-security cellmate and the deal we struck to exchange information on how to survive on the inside with advice on how to identify and exploit edges on the outside to legally make money in the stock market or any area of financial exchange.
As the first Canadian to receive and serve a Federal sentence of imprisonment for insider trading, I believe that I am well-suited to create a book that juxtaposes the rules of prison with the rules of finance; and, in so doing, provides an insight into both worlds that few have ever before considered.

THE NOVEL:
AN INSIDE TRADER'S GUIDE TO GETTING RICH ...and then surviving prison
PREFACEInsider trading cost me everything.  It cost me the life of my best friend and co-accused.  It cost me my money and my possessions.  It cost me my marriage, my children, my reputation, and my freedom.  Everything. Well ... maybe not everything.I still have memories of the millions of dollars of profits and the tens of millions of dollars of trades as well as the opportunities and lifestyle provided by nearly fifteen years of turning improperly obtained information into enormous amounts of money.  More importantly, my ""run"" (as gamblers would call it) also gave me a unique insight into how the Market and other areas of financial exchange really work and how I could apply that knowledge -- legally -- to make as much or more money than I ever made illegally.  Unfortunately, I had to become an inmate in a maximum security prison to finally appreciate that my ability to find and obtain an ""edge"" already gave me the capacity to acquire the financial benefits and riches associated with illegal insider trading -- but without any of the risks.The lessons you will find in this book helped me to survive prison and should, if applied with diligence and discipline, allow you to become rich.  It is a novel of my relationship with my cellmate and the record of the deal I made with him and other inmates to ensure my safety and well-being.  In short, I traded information on how to legally make money in the Market and elsewhere on the outside for knowledge on how to exist and survive in the predatory environment of hopelessness and violence on the inside.  The advice found within allows you to take from it what you will as my counsel moves along a spectrum of safe and certain to more aggressive and equally certain, but always with an eye toward finding and using an edge to ensure a profit.  Of course, that's not to say that if you happen to acquire inside information you won't also learn about what to do and not to do from my experiences (I certainly know what I would have done differently to avoid ever getting caught -- let alone convicted -- and will share that for you to do with as you wish).  It's simply that you don't need to have inside information or do anything improper to make the kind of money made by those, like myself, that did things that were not only improper but highly illegal. The advice that you will find in this book is tried, tested, and true.  Not only would I bet my life on it -- I already did.I hope that the following will surprise, entertain and inform as it teaches you how to profit like a convicted inside trader -- without actually becoming one.CHAPTER 1:  ""INSIDE"" TRADING""Arms high. Grab the wall. Open your legs.""As I stood stripped of clothes and spread plain from floor to hands, I wondered why my introduction to prison had not yet produced a metamorphosis of spirit or a thought more profound in me than a concern for my now exposed member.""Bottoms of your feet.  Show left foot.  Down.  Same thing right foot.  Down.""If I was expected to give up everything -- money, family, friends, reputation and freedom -- I wanted it to be in exchange for one of those life-changing moments you see in movies or hear about in interviews with Oprah: a moment that so overwhelms you that you can't help but pledge to God, yourself or whomever that things would now be different – that I would become a new and better person. ""One step back.  Bend at the middle.  Touch your toes.  Hold.  Ok, up.""But it never came.Any moment I had was dominated by the embarrassment of my condition and any self-awareness never extended beyond the flesh between my legs.  Not one of my better trades, I had to admit.  Before I could mark the result against a mental ledger, my thoughts were broken by the thump of clothes, balled-up and dropped hard against the back of my heels in time with the delivery of another set of instructions.""Turn around. Put those on. Wait.""That sounded about right, I told myself sarcastically.  I wasn't prepared to have my first act of defiance within the Federal Penitentiary system be a refusal to stop being naked in a room filled tight with a dozen correctional officers and a near equal number of men sharing my condition.  Eager to get to the waiting part of the directions as soon as possible, I shot an arm deep into the pile of clothes at my feet, grabbed some paper-thin blue boxer shorts and hurriedly dressed before pulling on a pair of lint-covered white socks -- all the while balancing on alternating legs to facilitate the process.The next item to hand was an unusually large orange T-shirt, faded and stretched loose through what I suspect were multiple wearing and washing.  Before giving too much consideration to the implications of the shirt's less than ""gently used"" state on the underwear now on my skin, I drew it over my head and, after feeling its edge drop past my thighs to just above the knees, hoped for a better fit from what remained. Other than what looked like nondescript blue deck-shoes traced at their toe and sides with white rubber casing, the final piece of my ensemble was another version of the heavy denim orange jumpsuit I had worn in Provincial jail prior to my transfer to the Federal system -- this time as clean an outfit of that type and color as I could imagine save for the ""4X"" stained into the cuff of each leg and the collection of loose threads caught in the tired strip of Velcro running from its neck to inseam.  As I wrestled the stiff garment around my shoes and up and over my frame, the large brown-skinned officer charged with my processing looked away from the screen that had held his attention since my arrival and asked, ""This your first Penitentiary bit?"" Was it that obvious, I wondered?  ""Yes sir, it is. My first time ever in prison.   I mean, first time other than the jail I just came from after sentencing to here sir. Yes, first time.""""I figured as much,"" he said, directing a glance at the kit of rolled-up towels, linens and fabric still on the floor in front of me. ""Cuz you're trying to seal up your jumper without first putting on a second pair of underpants.""Second pair? The confusion on my face must alone have requested an explanation because he continued as if in response.  ""Yeah, I know it's kinda queer, but these ranges are obsessed with not showing or seeing a guy's junk.  So: two sets of underwear on all the time outside your House, including showers. Go to it.""Including showers? What? Are you serious?  ""Yes sir. Thank you, sir"" I said instead before I tore open my uniform's seam in time with a move lower for a pair of boxers that looked to have also surrendered their original colour and form long ago.  If this was a practical joke at my expense, I could think of worse; and, if it wasn’t, my research in preparation for prison had obviously not been as complete as I assumed. Worrying about wearing an extra set of underwear bunched below my midriff or how many men had already worn them did not make much sense considering with what else I had to concern myself.  I slipped into the second pair and, after a quick glance to see if any guards were looking and laughing in my direction -- they were not -- re-entered the legs of my jumper before draping the outfit over my arms and shoulders and running an open hand along my chest to twin-up its front. With my prison attire now seemingly as it should be, I stooped over to collect what of mine remained on the floor, straightened, and then stood quietly in anticipation of the next order, instruction, or word of advice. ""Good, good, that's a better start,"" the guard said, leaning against the desk between us, his fingers clicking at a computer's keyboard. ""But before I get to what I've gotta do to move you over, can you answer something?"" ""Yes sir,"" I said faintly as I suddenly felt my chest constrict with the realization of where I was and where I was going to be for the next few months of my life.  I took a deep breath to compensate.“It says here you're receiving a sentence of three and three for fraud over. What kind of fraud gets a first-timer a Federal sentence that requires you to spend the ninety-day assessment part of your stretch in a maximum-security institution?”  He questioned, before adding an authoritative “Hmm?"" to make certain I would answer on cue.""Insider trading, sir. Its stock market related."" I said before waving a hand in the direction of his computer and continuing. ""As your files probably show somewhere, I made a great deal of money from more than a hundred separate illegal insider trading deals over a fifteen-or-so year period in Canada and the United States tha ..."" My voice thinned and then trailed quiet before breaking off entirely.The officer, appreciating my hesitation to speak further and perhaps seeing the same uninvited glances that I felt at my back, directed me closer with an upturned finger held bent at its tip like a hook calling for a worm and coolly asked, ""I know why you might not, believe me I do, but I need you to tell how much money was involved?  It might be useful for your processing and where you end up here and afterward.""I turned my head to look over one shoulder and then the other before responding in what I hoped was a more circumspect half-whisper, ""Sure. Umm, no-one is really certain because of how long my partner and I did it and the lack of records and what documents we destroyed after we found out the government was on to us, but for the sake of negotiating a deal between my lawyers and prosecutors and regulators on both sides of the border, everyone agreed to use the figure of more than twenty million dollars ... American.""""How much more than twenty million?"" he asked without hesitation.""Like I said no-one knows for certain -- not even me ... honestly. Since prosecutors couldn't pin it down to an exact number they just arbitrarily picked a level that was high enough for them to meet certain sentencing guidelines, but not so high that those guidelines would make the plea deal they wanted impossible. It could have been much higher and much worse really, so I was happy with what they picked … relatively speaking I mean about the happy part.""""I understand,"" he said in a way that I was fairly certain he did not.   As the sound of one guard and then another and then another cursing at someone behind to stop resisting pushed into my ear, I decided that placating the person charged with my processing was not too high a price to pay to keep him from that chorus.""So I guess this things been in the news recently?"" He speculated.""Yes sir, you're right, a lot I'm sure,"" I said. “Probably on television the morning I was sentenced and entered jail about a week ago and certainly on the front page of every business section in North America later that day or the next.”After a moment of contemplation, the officer straightened his body with a push from his desk and said, “Yah, now I see why you came here from Protective Custody.  Stay put and don't move 'cuz I need to talk to my supervisor for few secs'.  If you were on the News and it involved that kind of money, guys that transported up with you from the Bucket are sure to have enough to pass around.  Good chance that kind of beef will get you pieced-off pretty quick in Gen Pop.  Alright?”Alright? No, definitely not alright.  I didn’t need a complete understanding of prison slang to know that “Gen Pop” meant General Population and that “pieced off” in any context, especially one involving prison, didn't sound very appealing.  If he was worried about me being extorted or threatened by inmates that knew about my conviction or ""beef,"" I'm sure their efforts wouldn't be any less if it was also reported that the entirety of my assets had been confiscated under a worldwide seizure order executed by two governments and an assortment of self-interested bureaucracies.""Thank you sir,"" I replied respectfully before seeing him turn and walk along the wall behind his desk to the first open door on his left.  Accepting the judgment of this officer while hoping for the best seemed like the only course of action for me to take. I decided to mark time from his departure not in his offered secs or seconds but in how many voices I could identify in the room without turning around.  I believe I counted thirteen before he returned carrying a cellophane bag filled with what looked like toiletries and in the company of an older, officious-looking man with grey hair capping a tight, angry Irish face.“This is Mr. Donnelly.  He's in charge of placements here at Millhaven Assessment Unit,"" the guard said as he handed me the plastic bag without comment while turning in deference toward a bespectacled man wearing a military-dress white shirt stepping aggressively forward in front of the desk to within what I and most would consider an uncomfortable distance from my face.“You probably think your shit don't stink being a lawyer and all, but there's no Protective Custody here in Millhaven proper or anywhere else in the Federal Penitentiary system,"" snapped Mr. Donnelly.  ""We don't have P.C. for any white-collars regardless of what you may have been told above.  What we do offer at M.A.U. is the Special Needs and it normally houses Max inmates from outside the Assessment Unit on usually a short-term basis plus newcomers like you shipped down from the Bucket for processing and assignment,” he barked before drawing his lips back against his teeth high at the gum-line like a steel trap that had just been sprung by the move of his hands akimbo to his hips.I remembered someone from jail mentioning Special Needs as the place that I wanted to be in the Pen (Or was it not be?) because of the increased access to a payphone that it provided (Daily for twenty minutes rather than every second day for ten?), so I looked at him in a way that indicated that I was resigned to my fate and whatever he wanted to do with me.“There’s one space left in Range 2B, but don’t take it as any guarantee that what might happen in Gen Pop won’t also reach you in Special Needs.  Last I looked, 2B’s got a collection of max-time guys with “incompatibles” in other parts of the Institution, a few “skinners"" and ""diddlers,” some “deadbeats” laying low, a handful of others and – if you sign-off -- you for the next three months before you get shipped to probably a Min-Mother Institution to serve the rest of your sentence,” he offered.“Yes sir, I’ll accept it sir,” I said eagerly while not completely clear about the terms being applied to my future “rangemates?” or why my consent was even required.  I was so exhausted from my transfer and the stress associated with the day's now five-hour-and-counting ordeal of moving from jail to prison that any box with a bed would be a blessing and if it was one that also allowed me daily access to the phone or that satisfied any other “special needs” I might have the more the better.""Very well then.  Officer, get this offender signed-up and lined-up for Special Needs,"" ordered Mr. Donnelly before he surprised me by stepping out of character, leaning into my ear, and saying ""And good luck to you sir"" and then marching back to and through the doorway from whence he came.After holding his eyes on Mr. Donnelly until he had turned the corner and completely receded from view, the guard paused for a long moment before looking back to me and continuing.  ""Ok then, I guess that's the way it's going to be.  Just sign right there if you want to consent to the Special Needs Unit,"" he advised while offering me his pen for use over the signature line of a sheet of paper that was distinctive for being the only one of legal-size on his desk, ""and I can get you set up.""I pulled the pen from his hand, conscious of not allowing our fingers to touch during the exchange, and used it to place my mark where instructed without actually focusing my eyes on the page so as not to inadvertently read or even acknowledge a single word typed upon it.  Being completely trusting and removing any pretense of having control over my fate gave me a sense of contentment.  It was the same attitude I adopted in the past to avoid feeling stress when stuck in traffic or in a line at a store's check-out.  If the situation was beyond my control it was simply beyond my control and it wouldn't be any less so by my worrying about what would happen next, what I could do about it, or when things would change.After answering a few perfunctory questions that included whether I had used explosives in the commission of my offence (I knew he didn't understand my charges!) and if I had any gang affiliations or criminal associations, he instructed me to look at the small camera affixed to the back of his computer's monitor and not blink.  I heard a click.  ""Ok, that's done.  Stay right here,"" he again ordered before stepping toward and into the same room from which he had pulled Mr. Donnelly earlier.  After a moment brief enough that I hadn't had time to remember to distract myself by counting the number of unique voices around me, he returned carrying two plastic cards -- one in each hand as if trying to honour the separate sources that had delivered them to his care.""This one is your Photo-ID card,"" he said as he leaned slightly over his desk to describe the clear plastic square in his left hand laminating a card that held a stamp-sized picture of me along with my name in big, blue block letters, the Canadian flag, and details on the back about my height, weight, complexion, and date of birth.  The plastic coating on one end of the card was extended and teased into a loop that loosely encircled a small, silver-coloured metal shirt-clip.   ""It has your picture as you see and your FPS or Finger Print System number below it.  You need to show this card to pick up mail marked as privileged if you're called down to Security for that or to attend at Medical or for movement really anywhere outside of this room or your range.  Ok?""""Ok,"" I quickly affirmed. ""This other white one,"" he continued after dropping my Photo-ID to his desk and bringing forward an all-white plastic card that had the look and shape of a credit card, save for a fingernail's-width wide rectangular hole at its base, ""is for your inmate phone privileges.  If you don't already know which you probably don't, you can't make a call on the payphones in prison without first inserting this card and then typing the FPS number I just told you about.   The clip hanging from the ID is what guy's use to keep both cards together to help out if they forget their phone card since there's nothing visible on it to identify it as yours.  It's also good for reserving a call when you're next-in-line by putting the ID card of the pair on top of the phone near the receptacle. You'll see how it works soon enough upstairs or in yard so don't worry.""""Thank you,"" I said -- full of worry -- as I took the white card from his hand and adjusted it to allow me to pinch and push the clip from the Photo-ID through its opening before slipping the combination into a front pocket.  ""Oh, sorry, I forgot, is that ok putting it away?"" I asked as I turned my body to push forward the hip pocket that now held both cards.""Yah, sure, keep it in there if you want,"" he said with a mix of indifference and irritation.  ""Like I said, you just have to have your ID with you when you're walking around.  No need to clip it on your chest or anything like that for obvious reasons.""""Sorry?""""You know, obvious reasons for someone like yourself like not wanting to walk around and advertise a name that anyone in a phone call to the outside world could ask to have Googled,"" he answered.""Yes, thank you, that makes sense,"" I said, letting go of the cards in my pocket and pulling out an empty hand to place back at my side.""Now that we're good, bring your linens and that bag I gave you and come with me to holding where you were dropped-off when you came in,"" he said as he directed me with a point and turn of his hand to step to my right and walk around the privacy wall at my back and ahead a dozen paces to a caged-in area that held me when I first arrived, then in shackles from the transport van and jail before.  I moved as instructed, but on reaching the holding cell I stopped short of its door and stepped to the side -- ostensibly to allow the guard following behind to open it.  Instead, and likely in deference to protocol and position, he stayed at my back scolding, ""Don't just stand there!  Slide that rod handle over and take an empty spot on the benches with the others.""""Sure thing ... BOSS,"" I said sarcastically, now more concerned with the opinion of ""the others"" in front of me than his from behind.""You guys gonna get food in a minute.  No movement until we're done serving the ranges upstairs,"" the guard yelled through me to the men inside.I grabbed the metal bar that kept the door closed rather than locked and forced it over before drawing open the cage.  The enclosure was what you would imagine a chicken coop would look like if increased in size to limit the movement of men rather than chickens to no more than a step or two and if its wire was replaced with thick metal fencing traced up a dozen feet around the perimeter and then above and over to cover those within.  Aluminum benches were secured to the floor along two of its sides and backed to an open area containing a lidless bowl and a stainless steel sink assembly similar to what would be found in the lavatory of an airplane (granted, a menacing-looking airplane) but without a mirror or the pretense of cleanliness.  The floor was lacquered concrete and distinctive only for how moist and slick with grime its surface looked without actually being wet and for a drain recessed into the room's centre that appeared to be covered in a melange of mold, hair and scraps of multi-coloured paper.Three inmates were already inside.  The two seated to my right looked up for a moment as if to try and place my face, but without success.  The closest of the pair was a short muscular black man of about twenty, his hair worked into cornrows and tailing-off to just past the collar of his jumper and a raised scar under his chin.  The other, a decade or so older, was of Native descent and in possession of an almost comically-large barrel chest and abdomen, his girth made all the more impressive by how thin his arms, legs, and head looked extending from that massive core.  The last of the three, nearly larger than the other two combined, was sprawled alone over the opposite bench with his eyes closed and head resting on a roll of toilet paper like some tiny make-shift pillow.  Of the three, he was the only one that I had seen before and knew for certain would be a danger.My path crossed that of the large sleeping man a week ago at the Don Jail with his arrival -- as opposed to mine -- being met with a genuine sense of excitement and ebullience from the inmates on my range.  Upon entering the Don, Bear, as he was called, made it known that he had ""packed"" for his arrest and, as a result, was bringing in more heroin to sell and share than he had ever done before.  By packed, of course, I mean shoved drugs encased in containers euphemistically called ""eggs"" deep into his rectum and beyond the inspection or reach of guards.  Bear's smuggling efforts were not so much motivated by his addiction (which was apparently the stuff of legend and in some way tied with his size to his nickname) as self-preservation:  He had been marked for death on the street and needed the drugs that he carried inside -- literally deep inside -- to buy the protections and favour of those in prison that could provide it.  Needless to say, I was not among that number. From what I knew of him, Bear was an addict and life-time violent criminal that fell into the habit of robbing drug dealers for their supplies.  The robbery that got him into trouble, or more trouble than he expected, involved breaking into a drug den with two accomplices, beating everyone inside to near death with baseball bats, and then running the den as his own for the day by selling the drugs that he could not use or carry to the dealer's regular customers coming to the door.  The aforementioned near-beaten-to-death dealer did not take the theft and assault on her person terribly well as evidenced by the murder of Bear's accomplices by way of ""hot shots"" of pure heroin stabbed into their necks shortly thereafter.  Knowing that he was likely to be killed by overdose or something worse, Bear decided that prudence dictated that he get arrested and incarcerated and off the streets until something was either worked out or done with or to the dealer.To get to the relative ""safety"" of jail, Bear proceeded to pack his backside with what remained of the stolen heroin before robbing a nearby pharmacy -- all with the intention of getting caught.  The story I heard involves him sitting outside the pharmacy's doors waiting to be arrested while casually popping and swallowing the pills he had just purloined.  Unfortunately for Bear, the police arrived sooner than expected -- or at least before he had finished consuming what he wanted to consume -- forcing him to get up and run into the street between cars shoving pill after pill into his mouth as he fled.   The chase continued until either all the pills were gone or Bear got tired of running or more likely just tired of cutting his mouth on the aluminum foil covering the blister packs he was biting open as he ran.I apologize for not being able to do a retelling justice.  I remember laughing quite hard (albeit to myself) when over-hearing the story because I pictured this tattooed, thick-bodied Frankenstein-like monster slow-running from the police in a way that would buy him some time; but, not so much of it as to result in either actual escape or the involuntary escape of a heroin-filled bag from his anus.  Even seeing him lying in front of me with his lips still all cut up from chewing into aluminum, I didn't feel much like laughing considering the intake officer's caution against inmates following me from jail and my eventually getting ""pieced-off"" in the penitentiary because of it.An analogy to hibernation probably sounds forced, but my chances would be better if this Bear slept through dinner and then kept sleeping until I moved to Special Needs and beyond.****Oscar Wilde, the author of ""An Ideal Husband"" (a play that contained one of the first literary references to insider trading), in commenting on his own imprisonment in a letter to the Daily Chronicle in 1897, wrote, ""Prisoners are, as a class, extremely sympathetic to each other.  Suffering and the community of suffering makes people kind.""  Here's hoping.****In tune with the closing of a metal gate behind, the whir of unseen pullies within the walls worked to slide aside an identical black barrier to my front.  Greeting me at the entrance to Range 2B of the Special Needs Unit was a man near my age and dressed in similar orange garb to my own; but, in possession of physical attributes that could only come from years of exercising in environments limited by space -- but not time.  Holding out his hand I could see that he carried squared raised shoulders that likely grew from endless push-ups on a cell floor, a wide stern the consequence of tens of thousands of back dips against a bed; and, hard red raised knuckles that I assume grew calloused from repeatedly punching the walls of his cell and not new inmates delivered into his charge on the range.  He was what back in jail would be called ""prison strong.""   ""I go by Cowboy.  I'm the Cleaner,"" he said shaking my hand firmly.""Name's Stan.  Hey,"" I responded directly and in a tone matched to his.""Being Cleaner means my box is open all day except when it ain't.  If you need toilet paper or the mop or something when you're out for showers ya come to me,"" he explained matter-of-factly as if he had said the same hundreds of times to hundreds of others before.  ""Word to the wise:  Don't let me catch you cracking to the guards back in the Bubble or when they're doing walkthroughs -- you speak to me with what ya got and I'll relay it to whoever needs to hear it.  Comprende?""""I understand Cowboy,"" I said before looking back over my shoulder almost longingly to the ""Bubble,"" a Plexiglas enclosed guard station behind two gates and at the centre of the stairwell outside the range.""Best be,"" he snapped, making a fist for what I hoped was only affect.  ""I'm doing my Pen bit here -- ain't just passing through for assessment like you and almost everybody else.  Even with it being Special Needs I got a solid range going on, so if anyone sees you cracking to a C.O. they're going to think the worst of it because they know I tell that same shit to everybody.  You feelin me on this newfish?""""I do.  I understand.  If I need anything from the guards I should go to you first,"" I summarized while nodding my head dramatically for anyone else watching to see.""Not just first -- only.  Ya got boxed into 217.  Let's go,"" he said before he gave me a look to follow, turned and started ahead.Range 2B was marked by a row of cells on each side of a long, wide hallway with no evidence of guards beyond those that I knew existed outside the gates at my back. Unlike jail where the cells were barred, here the doors were solid slabs of metal akin to bank vaults but painted in alternating colours of red, blue, and green, with an envelope-size window near their top at eye level and a rectangular slot at their centre, big enough to pass a food-tray through when unlocked.  At the head of the hallway were a pair of payphones, each affixed to the wall and adjacent to one of two doorless cells that appeared to have been refurbished on-the-cheap to allow for their use as showers.   Ahead at the centre of the range was a small table about the size of a school-desk on which a toaster and a commercial-grade hot water pot sat along with a pile of sliced white bread on a brown paper towel and a yellow-stained tube that looked like the barrel of a large syringe that had been split at its seam.  Probably because my senses were heightened by fear, everything seemed bright and alive to me, but still somewhat unreal -- almost like I was watching a 3-D movie from within.  As I trailed Cowboy I thought about pulling my back straight and flexing the muscles of my chest to look tough for my new audience, but that idea grew weak as soon as I was able to make out the jackal-like shouts coming from the cells at my sides.""That's him.  That's the guy! That's the guy!"" I heard howled from face after face pushing against the reinforced-glass of each window that I passed.  With every step deeper into the range and every shout that I heard, panic grew in my gut like a meal I couldn't digest.  How do these inmates know me and why are they so angry?  Why do they even care about my arrival?  I can't believe my crime of insider trading is notorious enough to merit this kind of outrage and attention, particularly on a form of protective custody range that probably has and certainly has seen more than a few rapists and child murderers.  It doesn't make any sense,"" I felt my lips mouth.""No need to be shaking it rough,"" Cowboy shouted back at me dismissively as if he'd heard my thoughts.  ""We yell that shit at everybody as they come in.  Sort of our thing on this range so that guys deservin' of it don't stand out from everyone else.  Doesn't mean anything.  Just jokes.""""Just jokes.  Very funny,"" I commented flatly at Cowboy's back as I continued to follow him through the comedic din that now surrounded us and toward a cell ahead and to our left that I could see opening in time with my arrival.""Welcome home,"" Cowboy sneered as he stopped and turned to funnel me with his body to its entrance.  ""Your cellie's Murd--""""George!  Tell 'em to call me George.""  I heard a voice inside cut him off sharply.""George? Ok, whatever, Geooorge,"" Cowboy said as he drew out the name, punctuating it with a laugh. ""Get in there with I guess Geooorge so the Bubble can lock all your asses up.""I stepped forward cautiously, passing through the opening just before the red-painted steel cell-door slid shut and clanked behind.  Staring at me was my new cell-mate, a stocky and pale biker-type with longish unkempt black hair and a thistle-bush of a beard, heavy-set and shirtless and sitting on the bottom bunk, wearing nothing but shower sandals and boxer shorts and ink-blue tattoos on his bare chest, arms, and neck and a disdainful look on his face like a man watching a bus he missed pull away.  I stared back wordlessly for a long moment to allow him to speak before finally breaking the awkward quiet by dropping my bag and belongings on the top bunk and introducing myself as Stan.""What the fuck do you think you're doing putting that shit up there?"" He roared back after my name, head forward and nostrils flaring, black eyes fixed on me with loathing, his lips set in a tight line.""Sorry, I just thought my bunk was on top since it was empty and you didn't say anything."" I explained apologetically, hurriedly pulling down my belongings from the bed and dropping them to my sides.""Then you shoulda fuckin' asked!  I can be wherever the fuck I want in my house.  Put your shit on and under the bottom bunk.  Top and everything else is mine,"" he bellowed loudly as if wanting to be heard by both me and everyone outside our cell.""Again, look, I'm sorry, no disrespect intended,"" I explained plaintively, raising my hands up along my sides to just above my shoulders with palms open like the victim of a stick-up.  ""I assumed that since you were on the bottom that was your spot.  My mistake.  Sorry.  No need for us to get off to a bad start.""Out of an equal measure of deference and confusion I glimpsed down and away from the wild-eyed stare he held on me.  What I saw before bringing my attention back in the most non-threatening manner I could muster was a closet-sized room with beige-painted walls, dirty and cracked or cracking white plastic tiles, a set of bunks, a metal desk and metal sink assembly and nothing much else but a portable TV resting on a short ledge at right angle to the toilet.George greeted the return of my eyes by cocking his head like a cobra and slowly drawing his tongue out, draping it between his teeth and lower lip, and then quickly pulling it back to create a smacking sound with his mouth, almost like a bizarre duck call -- Swack!.Is this normal in prison?  Am I supposed to know what that means?  I rummaged through my mind and my limited experiences from jail for an explanation, but couldn't find one to bring sense to what he was doing.Swack!  The sound echoed wet inside his mouth and then once more against the metal walls of the cell like a rumble.  Before I could attempt to give meaning to the release of a third ""swack,"" George bolted up straight and lunged towards me fast with a muscled and painted fore-arm at the lead.  I felt my knees buckle and my eyes grow wide, ready to be struck by a punch yet undelivered.  But with a sort of self-satisfied grin, George abruptly stopped his advance -- inertia and all -- threw his head back and laughed like someone that found everything amusing before he lowered his arms and offered a hand for me to shake. As we did -- his grip suffocating in strength and unnaturally moist -- he sniggered while embracing my shoulder like a long-lost friend, ""Us? Yah, no need for US to get off to a bad start.  We can be buddies, huh new guy?"" What his pronouncement appeared to be lacking in sincerity and context, it more than made up for in being what I wanted to hear.  Maybe everyone in 2B was just a bad comedian waiting to get out, I imagined, and not a cruel sociopath.  Maybe.""Great.  That would be great,"" I replied weakly, still expecting bad news to break at any moment.Shuffling around him haltingly with my bag and linens now in hand and toward the window at the back wall and our bunks to its right, I tossed my belongings on and under the bed as he had directed and took a longer look at my new home. A big metal desk (but no chair) crowded near my bed and, when lying down, I speculated that my toes would be over its end and no more than a half-leg again away from the door. The room was about eight by ten feet in size and offered maybe ten square feet in total floor space outside the beds, desk, sink and toilet to move around -- less so if George was occupying the middle of it as he was now.""In that bag the coppers gave ya coming in there's a plastic pill bottle with a red sticker on it.  It'll have bleach to clean your works if you're a shooter.""  George said confidently, pointing at the jumble of contents that I had just dropped on the bed.""I won't need that.  I don't do any drugs,"" I responded quickly.""Yah, about that:  I don't care.  I'm telling ya cuz yer gonna use the bleach to clean this cell,"" he explained curtly.  ""New guys gotta do it coming in.  Range-rule.""At that moment I was not inclined to argue the fairness of a rule that required me to clean something that I had no involvement in making dirty, even with someone who was apparently my ""Buddy.""  ""Sounds fair,"" I rationalized instead.  ""I was going to do it anyway,"" I continued, ""but I'm glad you told me about the Range-rule.  I was a bit worried that my cleaning might cause offence by looking like a judgment on your cleanliness or how the room smells (dry, acidic, and sickly sweet, I didn't add).""""If you think cleaning a cell could offend someone, you're fucked,"" George spat out in a way that the word ""fucked"" sounded like it was comprised of three syllables. ""With brain-work like that this has gotta be your first time down below,"" he snorted.""In prison? Yes, yes it is.  I've been getting that a lot today as you can imagine.  Must be something about my face or how my brain works,"" I laughed nervously, repeating his phrase back to him as I pulled a wash-cloth out of the plastic bag on my bed.  ""I'll get to cleaning now,"" I said briskly hoping that he would approve of my efforts and not object to my turning away from him and further questions about my history that I didn't want to answer.The sink seemed as good a place to start as any.  It was cleaner than I expected and sat atop an enclosed solid stainless steel column extending to the floor and connected to the toilet by piping at its rear.  Protruding from a flap above its crest and against the wall were three identical unlabeled metal buttons the size and shape of toothpaste caps.  Through experimentation, I learned that pushing the first provided hot water for exactly three seconds before shutting off until pushed again, the second cold for near double that time, and that a firm push of the third caused the toilet to flush very loudly and for a lot longer than anyone would expect.  In the basin's bottom, George, or whomever, had jammed a travel-size stick of deodorant to infuse the room when water drained over it.Pasted above the sink with dried toothpaste was a shiny sheet of foil that served as a mirror, albeit one that was hazy and, with the distortions it reflected, more fitting for a funhouse than a jailhouse.  To its left, and nearer to the toilet than the sink, was another button, this about the size of a silver dollar and raised only slightly so that it was near flush with the wall.  Written above the button in black, block letters were the words, ""WARNING:  PUSH ONLY IN EMERGENCY.""George must have followed the path of my eyes because as soon as I had finished reading the word EMERGENCY he reached across my chest and pushed the button into the wall with a thumb.  With mouth agape, I turned to him wondering what just happened.""Did that ... uhh set off an alarm or something?"" I questioned timidly while the inner me fought back the urge to scream ""Why the hell did you do that you idiot!?""""No alarm we can hear when its pushed, but something goes off in the Bubble,"" George explained calmly. ""Guards are supposed to respond like it’s an Emergency because you could be having a heart attack from the stress of moving in or something or I could be killing you in here for all they know.  Whether they come and when they come ... Aah,"" he Kanye-shrugged, indifferent to my anxiety. What kind of bi-polar maniac was I put in a cell with?  There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to his actions.  Unpredictability, as I was counseled by the older inmates with whom I played cards in the Bucket, can be an effective defensive strategy to adopt in both prison and poker; but, George just came across as crazy and dangerous.  Or maybe that was the point:  If I didn't have to share a cell with him, I'd certainly avoid George as much as I could.  But I did ... and I couldn't.""Just keep cleaning and don't think about the button other than what time it was when you pushed it,"" George instructed curiously.  ""Something else needs doing,"" he continued as he reached into his pocket like it was the drive-thru window of a fast-food restaurant and pulled out three plastic packs of ketchup.  Arranging them in his right hand between his thumb and fore-finger, he brought the packs together at one end and tore them open with a single bite of his teeth.  Without explanation, he squeezed their viscous contents into the palm of his left hand and then flicked the clump of empty ketchup-covered shells past my face and into the toilet.  I didn't know what to say in response, but before that became obvious to both of us George moved to the desk, raised his right knee like a Olympic hurdler, stepped up and upon its top, and straightened his lead leg above with a grunt and the help of a forceful jump-hop from his other below.   In the face of such a bizarre spectacle, his attribution about who had pushed the button did not seem worth challenging.Standing on the desk and balancing on his toes to stretch out his frame above it, George brought a crimson covered hand up to the light fixture at the ceiling and carefully massaged ketchup over and around the single dark bulb at its centre.  ""This middle bulb is called a guard-light and it goes off red every hour when the pigs come by for their walk-throughs,"" he explained.  ""No big deal during the day, but at night the light is so fuckin' bright it'll cut you awake.  Since we can't break it out or cover it with toilet paper, all we got left is to slime it with ketchup,"" he said, continuing to paint the bulb thick with delicate brushes of an open palm.  ""Being red the ketchup doesn't look so noticeable when the light is off, but when it's on it blocks a lot of the fuckin' glare,"" he said, finishing the job through breaths heavy with his weight and the extension of an arm high above his head.After transferring as much ketchup from his hand to the bulb as looked possible, George bent his knees to squat low before jumping from the desk with a bounce off the floor, only steadying himself with a single touch of a clean palm against the bunks.   Holding his ketchup-covered hand by his ear, he moved to wedge me out from in front of the sink before running the water to wash himself clean of the scarlet goo. After shaking the wet from his fingers, he wiped them dry on his backside and returned to the desk to sit with a plop on the corner closest to the window and farthest from the door.  ""You can go back to cleaning the sink now,"" he said.  ""Looks like it needs it and I want you around the shitter when they come in.""They? Oh, yes, the Emergency Button.  With that, I heard the clank of the gate opening at the entrance to the range and the fizz of electricity before the condiment covered bulb above flickered on, blanketing the room in an eerie red glow.  George lifted his chin, now illuminated in red like everything else, and leaned back on his hands to better see the result of his efforts.  Not having experienced the ruby brightness of the light before his handy-work, I was more impressed by how quickly the smell of heated ketchup filled our surroundings than how less or more red the light now looked.  After hearing footsteps assemble outside the cell, our door slid open with the clangor and shake of metal against metal to reveal three correctional officers dressed in standard blue prison fatigues in the middle of the hall-way.  The guard closest to the entrance was the same correctional officer that had frisked me earlier in the Bubble before delivering me to Cowboy on the range.""What's the emergency?"" he asked sternly, adjusting the fingers on his leather gloves as he spoke.""New guy was cleaning around the toilet and hit the E-button by accident,"" George lied leaning to his side to look out the door while jerking an incriminating thumb in my direction. ""Is that right Gurmoosky?"" the guard asked, studying me warily as I stood in front of our bunks with a cloth bunched in one hand and pill container filled with bleach in the other.  I ignored the mispronunciation of my name and replied with a quick affirmative nod before looking away and stepping to the sink.  A prudent decision, I concluded, with Cowboy's warning against speaking to the guards still in my head and George this night set to be sleeping just outside and above it.""Tower!  2B! Looock it up!"" the officer shouted without pause down the range and with an unnecessary flourish.  With that, the red guard-light that announced their arrival went dark and the door began to close.  As soon as the latch clanked shut, I moved forward to look out the window and saw that all three guards had already walked past its limits and out of view.  Emergency over. I was alone again.""He ... looked ... pissed!"" George laughed as the ripples of fat on his stomach, pale as milk, twisted and folded on each other, mocking me like grins. ""Sure to take a lot longer for the next emergency now that you're considered accident prone,"" he advised with a dark smile, making clear the point of the entire exercise.""Come on George, please, it's too much.  I don't wanna play these games.  I've had a long day and I just want to do my time in Assessment and move on,"" I said with a tone of frustration that coming from someone else might have bordered on the confrontational.""And what would that be?  What would you be doing time for in Assessment?"" George questioned aggressively as if I had somehow breached prison protocol leaving the subject open for him to investigate.""It doesn't matter what I did,"" I replied dismissively.  ""All I want is to do my time as uneventfully as possible and that means I'm not going to bother you if you don't bother me.""""I guarantee that you're not goin' to fuckin' bother me.  Not in my fuckin' house,"" George said forcefully, arching his arms back and leaning forward.  ""And it does fuckin' matter!  I'm not sharing a cell with some diddler or skinner and have that beef come back on my reputation for not doing anything about it.""  He moved a step closer.""Listen George, I'm not a diddler or a rape-hound or a rat or a bug or a bird or a box-thief or a hammerhawk or a goof or a poof or whatever the hell other prison word you are worried about applying to me,"" I exclaimed with growing vigor as the anger that had coiled inside me since my sentencing sprung loose with defiance (and maybe recklessness?).  And now, I thought to myself, for the ultimate prison-sanctioned ""coup de grace"" to end the dispute in my favour:  ""Just do your own fuckin' time, George!  Just do your own fuckin' time!"" I yelled.In jail I was taught that ""just do your own time"" was what you said when you wanted to remind others that their behaviour or choices in prison shouldn't impact upon you.  For example, if I wanted to watch television I should only watch it while wearing headphones so that no one else would have to share in my experience or ""do my time with me.""  Similarly, if I needed to use the toilet I should wait until either my cellmate was at yard or given sufficient notice to grab some air from the window or the crack at the door.  And, even with that, flushing constantly was expected and certainly ""whenever a turd started to turtle.""   In short, ""just do your own time"" was a demand to adhere to a code that dictated that how you choose to serve your sentence shouldn't impact on how I choose to serve mine.  Or at least that's what I was told I should say if I wanted to garner the respect of inmates in prison.""Firstly, it’s 'do your own time,' not 'just do your own fuckin' time,'"" George corrected quietly through a graveled whisper.  ""Secondly or lastly ..."" If he said another word after that I didn't hear it as he rushed toward me like a storm, barreling me with a shoulder into the narrow corner at the centre of the cell, my lower-back broken over a short shelf jutting from the wall.  As my legs gave way to the shock, my body slid lower until it was caught by an elbow that George pressed up and under my chin, wedging my head hard against the ledge behind. ""Help,"" I cried to rescuers unseen, hoping that I had thrown out a hand toward the Emergency Button on my fall backwards and not just imagined the effort.  Blood, trapped and growing heavy in my head, filled my ears with white-noise.  His forearm, corded with muscle and intent, held my neck and head still with a sinewy crackle. ""What's your beef?  What the fuck you in for?"" he yelled down to me, rabid spittle raining into my eyes.""Ima .. Ima inside trader,"" I forced out breathlessly in surrender.  ""Look at my papers .... my A4 ... D ...  My papers  ... Ima ... inside trader.  Don't!""  I begged through gasps, tears offered by my eyes like ransom.""Hmm ... maybe we can work something out,"" I thought I heard George say before my world went dark and I reached out for the smell of caramelized ketchup as if it were a blanket.

<p>The purpose of the campaign is to accept pre-publication subscriptions for my book in order to speed its completion.  If I receive the minimum requested funding by the beginning of September, I'll finish it in September.  If I don't (or don't receive any subscriptions at all), I'll finish it in October.  Either way, those who subscribe will receive what they subscribed for.</p>
<p>The purpose of the book is to finally begin to tell the truth about ethnicity in Colonial America, starting right at the beginning of British Colonial America, i.e., Roanoke.</p>
<p><strong>The Myth</strong></p>
<p><span>For generations, our textbooks have described Roanoke as an English colony made up solely of English sent by an English queen, Elizabeth I of the House of Tudor.  For generations, our assumption has been that they were all native English-speakers.  All the histories you and I have ever seen or read describe Virginia Dare as the first English child born in America. </span></p>
<p><span>This version of our history has been confirmed at the state and even the federal level.  For example, the NPS (National Park Service) website provides the detail that ""Wingina, King of the Roanoke tribe, did not have enough reserves for his own people and certainly not enough for more than 100 Englishmen.""  Referring to Virginia Dare, the NPS states that ""She was the first child of English parents ever born in what Europeans called the New World of America.""</span></p>
<p><span>A neat and simple story, perfect for the boring-as-mud, summarized-into-inaccuracy version of American history found in our Social Studies textbooks. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Problem</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The only problem is it's not true. </span></p>
<p><span>For example:</span></p>
<p><span>Elizabeth I's family name was actually Tewdwr, not Tudor.  They hadn't forgotten that they were Welsh, they spoke Welsh when not speaking English or Latin, and they remained paranoid about English rivals with equal or better claims to the English throne who also hadn't forgotten that the so-called 'Tudors' were Welsh.</span></p>
<p><span>Elizabeth's mini-empire already included much more than England.  So why should we assume that she would send only English-speaking English and no one from Welsh-speaking Wales, and no one from Irish-speaking Ireland, and no one from Cornwall which still had plenty of Cornish-speakers despite the massacre (some call it genocide) of thousands of Cornish-speakers carried out by Elizabeth's brother Edward VI during the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549, and no one from the French-speaking islands of Guernsey and Jersey which had not (and still have not) fallen back into French hands?  And what if I told you that Virginia Dare was only part-English?</span></p>
<p><span>And why not send some of those willing to serve from amongst the Dutch-speaking Protestant refugees from the Spanish Netherlands, or German-speaking Protestant refugees from Catholic areas of Germany, or Jewish refugees from the Inquisition of Spain? </span></p>
<p><span>The fact is it would be daft to assume that Elizabeth or her commanders would send only English.  Instead, it's possible to positively identify a significant number of non-English who participated in the Roanoke expeditions.</span></p>
<p><span>Those are just examples of the material covered in my research.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Solution</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Using as a foundation the excellent, ground-breaking work of William S. Powell and David Beers Quinn, I completed my research on the military expedition of 1585 and wrote it up for Thomas Reimer's American Ethnic History course at SUNY Empire State College.  Going forward on the same basis, I completed my research on the lost colony of 1587 and wrote it up for David Smith's and Erik Heinrich's post-graduate course in Early Modern Britain at Harvard.  My professors liked my work.  I can't claim peer review, but I can certainly claim superior review from leading experts in the field. </span></p>
<p><span>Now I need to merge these papers into a single, cohesive whole.  Together they will tell the true story of the beginning of multi-ethnic America.   </span></p>
<p><span>It's high time to tell that far-more-interesting story.  It should have been told all along.</span></p>

<li>Sales professionals (again, a free report can open doors in ways that nothing else can)</li>
<li>Mothers/Fathers (want to write a book for your kids? I did and it was great!)</li>

I would love to be able to manage these things on my own, but I know that it's not possible and it would be unfair to those who have invested in themselves and me to not offer the highest level of service. I will be setting up a scheduling program to manage appointments (Bestseller Breakthrough Brainstorming Sessions as well as the 45-day and 90-day one-on-one weekly sessions); a platform for sharing documents and assignments; Instant Teleseminar (for the telecourses...or something similar to that caliber); Recording Program for all of the telecourse classes and Brainstorming Sessions; and other programs and processes that become necessary.

A website capable of handling this level of programs and processes. Both the hosting and programming will be invested in with campaign contributions.

As you can see, I have put a lot of thought into this as I want to be able to offer the highest level of service and expertise to anyone and everyone who invests in my campaign and in themselves.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are able to contribute, I am incredibly grateful. If you are an aspiring writer, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with you and support you in your endeavors.If you are not a writer, but know of anyone who could benefit from this campaign, please share this link with them. Some of those would include:
Business Owners/Entrepreneurs (it is amazing how much an ebook or report can increase brand awareness and visibility)
Students who might need to work on a thesis or report
Sales professionals (again, a free report can open doors in ways that nothing else can)
Mothers/Fathers (want to write a book for your kids? I did and it was great!)
Anyone interested in documenting their own family history
Anyone who has a writing talent, but hasn't put it into this format yet (I started out as a copywriter so you never know.)
everyone who you feel may benefit from journaling thoughts or fantasies
There are many ways to get the word out:
Email
Social Media
Indiegogo share tools
Thank you in advance for your help with my campaign. I am looking forward to mentoring and guiding as many aspiring writers as I can and your funds and well wishes will help me in ways that I can't even describe.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

white gets the information across, color just brings everything to life. We work 
hard to make the photography that appears in CONTACT! Magazine help to tell the

the quality by publishing our book in black and white.</span></p>

The only thing keeping us from printing it in color is the cost. It's a big 
book, nearly 350 pages total, and that equates to a big cost to print. The cost

to pay more money for your homebuilt aircraft engine than you do for your entire 
airframe!""ng 


Mick Myal
Founding Editor of CONTACT! Magazine

To build your own 
aircraft your way, the way that meets your needs, the way that allows you to 
showcase your abilities, your creativity, your innovation and your 
craftsmanship- should not have to cost your life savings- and we're here to try 
to do something about that.
This is why for 
the past 20 years, in addition to publishing a top quality magazine aimed 
squarely at the homebuilding community, CONTACT! 
Magazine has produced a series of books on Alternative Engines 
used in homebuilt (experimental) aircraft- to help lead the way in showcasing 
alternative ideas and clever ways to save money by building, installing, and 
flying an alternative engine in homebuilt aircraft- without sacrificing quality 
or safety.
We're not 
satisfied with the status quo, and we're sure you aren't either.
From supercharged V-8 
automobile engines to lawn mower engines and everything in between, we've 
reviewed them all in CONTACT! Magazine with many of those articles being 
compiled into our book series. To date, four engine-specific compilations have 
been published and the newest such book, 

Alternative Engines Volume 4, has just been hatched!  



In the photo above: The Black Book (Volume 1) contains the first five years' worth of alternative engine articles that appeared in the pages of CONTACT! Magazine. The Blue Book (Volume 2) covers the second five year period, the Gold Book (Volume 3) covers the third five year period, and the Red Book (Volume 4) is the newest compilation. 



To preview the new Volume 4, the Red Book, click here.All four books are available for purchase through our website. And if you've never seen CONTACT! Magazine but would like to, click here.







Our 
Book 
Needs 
Color!
All of our engine books to date have been produced in black and white and they 
look great! However, we have a new opportunity to also produce a FULL COLOR 
version of Volume 
4. We have the proof in hand and it looks stunning!!! We debuted it 
at the COPPERSTATE fly-in October 2013 and the response was overwhelming.
While black and 
white gets the information across, color just brings everything to life. We work 
hard to make the photography that appears in CONTACT! Magazine help to tell the 
story, and we're proud of that work, so it's really a shame to lose a portion of 
the quality by publishing our book in black and white.

The only thing keeping us from printing it in color is the cost. It's a big 
book, nearly 350 pages total, and that equates to a big cost to print. The cost 
of the printer's setup is what's killing us, so what we're after is the money it 
will take to create the plates and set up the equipment for our press run. 
But we can't do it 
without your help!

What We Need & What You GetWhat we need is very simple: we need your 
support. We need you to help us bring this quality information to those who are 
waiting for it, and to do it in the full glory that it deserves. There's just no 
way we can pull this off without your help, but we're not asking for a handout! 
You will receive more than just a warm feeling if you chose to help us.
What do you get in 
return for your help? 



We're offering 
	several rewards for those who step up. To us, the most important of those is 
	to have your name added to a special page in the front of the book, a 
	permanent record acknowledging your support. However, if you'd rather remain anonymous we can add a friend's name, your pet's name, 
	your business name, or anyone else that you'd like to recognize in this 
	way. No matter 
	which level you decide to help us through, your name will be included. For 
	all of those who have already purchased the color version through our 
	website or magazine (and have been patiently waiting for us to go to print) 
	rest assured that your names will be added before the books are printed.

	gold thread, as opposed to the usual white stitching.



Ultimately, however, the best gift we have to offer our supporters is a limited collector's edition, hard-bound version of the book. 


We will only print enough of this edition to fulfill our obligation to those who help at this level. In any case, there will be a maximum of only 100 of these printed (probably far fewer that that), and each one will be signed and dated by the editor and numbered in the order in which the contributions are received.

In this case, the prizes can act as a type of pre-ordering system in which you can also receive one of the very first copies of Fingers and Toes.

No Risk, All Reward
This means that if I don't raise all of the money I need, you get your money back. There is absolutely no risk to you when you donate:) Unfortunately, if I don't raise all of the money I need, I will not be able to print Fingers and Toes. 


Why do I need support? 
My goal is to raise a total of $3,000. Here is where it will go: 

Production. Your generous contributions will go toward the cost of getting the book in top shape for printing and marketing. My project manager from Tate and I will begin editing the manuscript. Later, we will design the layout and do all sorts of other productiony things. Production usually lasts around 180 days.  

 

Illustrations. Illustrations will add an extra month to the editing portion of production. The art that you have seen so far is only concept art.  However, as I receive illustrations, I would love to provide a sneak-preview for my backers who follow on the official website or Facebook page. 
Printing. My goal is to have a book in your hands by late spring/early summer of 2015. The bulk of donations will go toward printing Fingers and Toes. 

Marketing. A marketing representative from Tate that will help me advertise and get the book on some shelves. 

Impact

  Fingers and Toes is an essential tool for friends and family members to instruct ""the greatest among you"" about unity in the church.  This book will enable children to understand that, as a part of the body, it is their job to work together in order to fulfill the dream of God. Together, we can raise up a generation of children who doesn't see denominational lines, but value each member of the body for its unique ideas and gifts.

An Important Book for Nurses on How to Bring More Awareness and Compassion to the Bedside
Help Make the Nurse at Your Bedside Happier 
Despite its enormous positive impact on the lives of millions of people, nursing can be a thankless job.
Nurse burnout is almost an epidemic due to stress, inadequate staffing, low pay, and lack of recognition.
So where should nurses turn? How can they take better care of themselves and show up at the bedside to care for those who need them?
The answers to these questions and more are in my book: Minding the Bedside: Nursing from the Heart of the Awakened Mind. My name is Jerome Stone. I’ve been a Registered Nurse for over 30 years. I’m a successful blogger, published author, and meditation instructor. Most important, I’m committed to transforming the way nurses show up at the bedside by teaching them how to be compassionate toward themselves and others.
My book helps nurses learn to open their hearts and minds to care for those who need them.
About the Book:
The first run of Minding the Bedside: Nursing from the Heart of the Awakened Mind was released in September 2011. The book is for nurses and healthcare practitioners and is a thorough guide to meditation and compassion practices. The practices and techniques covered in this book can help to antidote and alleviate the stress that nurses and healthcare practitioners experience working at the bedside.
The book has received positive reviews in peer-reviewed journals, online publications, and websites.

Since publishing the book, I’ve been creating tons of free content on the book’s blog-site, offering wit and wisdom to the thousands of readers who appreciate what I have to offer. I’ve even published two FREE ebooks on the site that continue to be downloaded and enjoyed by visitors to the site. In the recent months, visits to my site have increased and there’s a lot of interest in what I have to offer, but I’m not a publicist, and I need money to fulfill my vision.
What’s Been Done So Far:
As a self-published author I’ve done it all. I’ve:

Presented public talks 
Been interviewed on internet radio 

Taught healthcare providers (YouTube Video, my presentation starts at 3:31)
Written over 120 blog-posts related to meditation and compassion
Guest-blogged on a variety of sites 
Sent out hundreds of free copies of my book to professionals as well as lay-people to review and refer

<p><strong>There's even more to come! </strong> Alyssa and her friends have pushed me to begin work on a third book in the series-- a novel crammed with romance, intrigue, Indian magic, and time travel!</p>
<h3><strong>What's the Story?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Alyssa, the heroine of Book I, <em>The River Goddess &amp; Other Stories,</em> </strong>is a young girl who comes into her power with the aid of a mysterious River Goddess, a number of helpful animals and other beings, and a very old friend.  Alyssa faces many dangers and overcomes numerous challenges along the way.  As she learns how to tap into the magic of everyday life, she gradually develops a deep respect for her non-human guides and for herself.  In <em>Starfriends</em>, her adventures lead her further into the unknown-- and deeper into the discovery of her own wisdom and strength.  this is the ""Hero's Journey"" from a feminine point of view-- a journey upon which we are all embarked, male and female alike, as we rediscover our true role:  that of fellow travelers with <em>all</em> the beings who share space on the small blue planet we call Earth.</p>

<p>""Valentine has written a marvelous book,<em> The River Goddess &amp; Other Stories.  </em>I highly recommend it.  In a sense it's for teen and pre-teens but it works for anyone.  It's really a fairy tale or fable in the deepest sense of the word:  A teaching story about magical, shamanic, earth-centered practice and connection to nature.""<em> Joan Forest Mage, Executive Director, Life Force Arts Center, Chicago, IL.<br/></em></p>
<p>""With a very limited number of heroines in contemporary books that young girls can identify with,<em> The River Goddess &amp; Other Stories </em>is a beautiful addition.<em>  </em>In fact, it is so well writtten and imagined that boys of all ages (including my own) would enjoy it as well.  The inclusion of Alyssa's family along with animal spirit guides in these culturally fascinating adventures is also a strong bonus.  In the last story, one of those very verbal animal friends notes that it is unusual to find humans who believe in, not magic exactly, but 'possibilities.'  The best of stories open up new worlds of possibilities.  In this the author succeeds, not just by creating this new world of possibilities, but also by discovering the possibilities of the world we inhabit and may not have fully noticed yet.  This is a book well worth reading and then sharing."" <em> Robert F. Morgan, PhD, chair, Department of Psychology, University of Arkansas, Little Rock.<br/></em></p>
<p><em>""The River Goddess</em> is a collection of stories about a young girl who has a special ability in her innocence to communicate with nature. The magic that ensues is not flash/bang, but natural in a shamanistic tradition. There are profound lessons of humans manintaining a balance with nature in these stories. I recommend it especially for young girls who have given up their belief in Santa Claus, but miss the wonderful magic. It will stimulate their interest in biology and ecology as well. And adults can only be charmed by her adventures.""  Julie Keitges, Berkeley, CA.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18273753-rising-from-ashes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Introducing RISING FROM ASHES: EMPIRE OF BLOOD BOOK THREE! Click here to read the description for book three on its Goodreads page. (***Warning: This description has spoiliers for those who have yet to finish Fading in Darkness***)</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Hi, I'm Robert S. Wilson, author of the Empire of Blood series (SHINING IN CRIMSON, FADING IN DARKNESS and the forthcoming RISING FROM ASHES). I'm a Bram Stoker Award-nominated editor and author of dark speculative fiction ranging from science fiction and dark fantasy to noir and horror.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">When I first started to get feedback from readers about SHINING IN CRIMSON, the most common response I got went something like this, ""Where is book two? When will it be out? What kind of monster ARE YOU? HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME?"" Well, not so much those last two although I did have a couple of (albeit understandable) nasty and negative complaints after a while. And at the time I started writing FID, I had every intention of releasing the book within the next year. And then life went and changed on me. See, back then I was only a writer. But then I got into editing. I started with co-editing the AIDS charity book, Horror for Good: A Charitable Anthology. And then from there my life, and attention, became split in two directions. Writing and editing.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Shortly after that, along with two partners, I launched Nightscape Press and became its Editor in Chief. And ever since I've been very, very busy. But these things alone do not pay the bills yet, sadly, and I long ago took up freelance editing and various other author services in order to get by. Between both Nightscape Press and freelance work, I end up with very little time for writing. And because of which, it took nearly two years to finish FADING IN DARKNESS. And that was completely due to the fact that I had too many commitments to handle at the same time. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">So, I know as more people read FADING IN DARKNESS, they are going to want to read the next book and I'd like to make that happen much faster this time. I have two chapters written, but I find myself constantly dragged away from my progress by other commitments. So my plan with this fundraiser at its core, is to help fund the process of finishing the book in three short months. Two months to write it and one for a professional editor to help me make it shine. This time period would start as soon as the fundraiser is over. So, if all works out, the book will be ready to release as early as the beginning of January, 2014!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">This money will also cover the cost of editing, cover art, promotion, paying for the perks I'm offering to contributors, my coke habit (just kidding!), etc. This book is in my head and so very ready to come out into the world. And regardless of this campaign the book will see the light of day. But I don't think I'm the only one who doesn't want to wait another two friggin' years for that to happen!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<p>I think I've put together some great perks for long time fans as well as people who have yet to read even the first Empire of Blood book:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ebook editions of RISING FROM ASHES and/or SHINING IN CRIMSON (book one) and FADING IN DARKNESS (book two) for a low price!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signed paperback and limited hardcover editions of each individual book in the series as well as the same in omnibus editions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interactive perks: Name a vampire or a Foederati soldier in RISING FROM ASHES. Use your own name or somebody elses, or make one up. Your call!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rare pieces of memorabilia: Signed and personalized manuscripts of SHINING IN CRIMSON, an early draft of my unpublished novella THE NESTING PLACE, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>All contributors of any amount will be listed in the book's acknowledgements page (unless, of course, you're embarrassed to be seen with me!). <strong>All contributors who choose a physical perk will receive a signed Empire of Blood bookmark as well.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact?</span></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Contributors to this campaign can sleep with ease at night knowing they've helped solve global problems like world hunger, war, and climate change (okay, maybe actually none of that really...):</p>
<p>While this fundraiser is going I will be finishing up my current freelance obligations and getting what little writing I can done. If funded I will balance a very strict writing schedule with my work at Nightscape Press and finish an editor-ready draft of RISING FROM ASHES within two months of the end of this fundraiser in order to have the book edited, formatted, and ready in at least ebook format for contributors by early January. Then the process of paperback and hardcover production, ordering, signing and personalizing will take place with the goal of having all copies shipped out by the end of March at the very latest. As far as the public release goes, I have yet to decide how I will handle that. As I said earlier, a portion of these funds will go to promotion and I would like to have at least a month after the book is ready to promote it before releasing it publicly. </p>
<p>Here's my prior track record as an author, editor, and publisher:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Over the past several years as a writer I have written two novels (Empire of Blood books one and two), two novellas (THE QUIET and EXIT REALITY) and over a dozen short stories for various markets and as Kindle downloads.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">As an editor I have co-edited two anthologies (the Bram Stoker Award-nominated HORROR FOR GOOD: A CHARITABLE ANTHOLOGY which contributes to amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research and is available now, and NIGHTSCAPES VOLUME 1 which will be available soon) and solely edited one anthology (BLOOD TYPE: AN ANTHOLOGY OF VAMPIRE SF ON THE CUTTING EDGE which will contribute to The Cystic Fibrosis Trust and is due to be released on October 30th this year).</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">And as a publisher I have edited and released five novels (A REQUIEM FOR DEAD FLIES by Peter N. Dudar, the Bram Stoker Award-winning LIFE RAGE by L.L. Soares, DUNGEON BRAIN by Bram Stoker Award-winning author Benjamin Kane Ethridge, THE EVOLUTIONIST by Rena Mason, and STEALING NIGHT by Peter Giglio), three novellas (BUTTERFLY POTION by Nightmare Award-winning author Trent Zelazny, SUNFALL MANOR by Peter Giglio, and THE ANGEL OF SHADWELL by Jonathan Templar, and proofread and published one anthology (WORLD'S COLLIDER: A SHARED-WORLD ANTHOLOGY edited by Richard Salter). </p>
<p>For those who might be interested, here is a breakdown of how the funds donated to this campain will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 more or less will go to my Promotion and Production fund to cover the cost of hiring a professional editor, cover artwork, some other minor production costs, and to promote the book.</li>
<li>$2,000 more or less will go to paying for the production and shipping of the physical perks offered in this campaign as well as counting the cut that Indiegogo will take out. If this ends up costing more than 2k, the extra will come from my Promotion and Production fund, if it ends up costing less, more will go toward promotion.</li>
<li>$2,000 will go toward two months of living expenses to cover my bills and any possible materials I need during the two month stretch of finishing the final draft of the book.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>

What you will find is a brilliantly thought out society of Vampires.""--Jim Mcleod, Ginger Nuts of Horror""The Mesh of Religious symbolism and political commentary tucked neatly between pure horror and suspense is superb.""--Lisa Lane, The Cerebral Writer""With well-fleshed characters, multiple storylines and a vampire history that makes sense, Shining in Crimson: (Empire of Blood #1) is a well-written horror novel. I am anticipating the second and third books in the series.""--Trembles Horror Magazine

 
Introducing RISING FROM ASHES: EMPIRE OF BLOOD BOOK THREE! Click here to read the description for book three on its Goodreads page. (***Warning: This description has spoiliers for those who have yet to finish Fading in Darkness***)
 
Hi, I'm Robert S. Wilson, author of the Empire of Blood series (SHINING IN CRIMSON, FADING IN DARKNESS and the forthcoming RISING FROM ASHES). I'm a Bram Stoker Award-nominated editor and author of dark speculative fiction ranging from science fiction and dark fantasy to noir and horror.
When I first started to get feedback from readers about SHINING IN CRIMSON, the most common response I got went something like this, ""Where is book two? When will it be out? What kind of monster ARE YOU? HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME?"" Well, not so much those last two although I did have a couple of (albeit understandable) nasty and negative complaints after a while. And at the time I started writing FID, I had every intention of releasing the book within the next year. And then life went and changed on me. See, back then I was only a writer. But then I got into editing. I started with co-editing the AIDS charity book, Horror for Good: A Charitable Anthology. And then from there my life, and attention, became split in two directions. Writing and editing.
Shortly after that, along with two partners, I launched Nightscape Press and became its Editor in Chief. And ever since I've been very, very busy. But these things alone do not pay the bills yet, sadly, and I long ago took up freelance editing and various other author services in order to get by. Between both Nightscape Press and freelance work, I end up with very little time for writing. And because of which, it took nearly two years to finish FADING IN DARKNESS. And that was completely due to the fact that I had too many commitments to handle at the same time. 
So, I know as more people read FADING IN DARKNESS, they are going to want to read the next book and I'd like to make that happen much faster this time. I have two chapters written, but I find myself constantly dragged away from my progress by other commitments. So my plan with this fundraiser at its core, is to help fund the process of finishing the book in three short months. Two months to write it and one for a professional editor to help me make it shine. This time period would start as soon as the fundraiser is over. So, if all works out, the book will be ready to release as early as the beginning of January, 2014!
This money will also cover the cost of editing, cover art, promotion, paying for the perks I'm offering to contributors, my coke habit (just kidding!), etc. This book is in my head and so very ready to come out into the world. And regardless of this campaign the book will see the light of day. But I don't think I'm the only one who doesn't want to wait another two friggin' years for that to happen!
 



The Perks!
I think I've put together some great perks for long time fans as well as people who have yet to read even the first Empire of Blood book:


Ebook editions of RISING FROM ASHES and/or SHINING IN CRIMSON (book one) and FADING IN DARKNESS (book two) for a low price!


Signed paperback and limited hardcover editions of each individual book in the series as well as the same in omnibus editions.


Interactive perks: Name a vampire or a Foederati soldier in RISING FROM ASHES. Use your own name or somebody elses, or make one up. Your call!


Rare pieces of memorabilia: Signed and personalized manuscripts of SHINING IN CRIMSON, an early draft of my unpublished novella THE NESTING PLACE, and more.

All contributors of any amount will be listed in the book's acknowledgements page (unless, of course, you're embarrassed to be seen with me!). All contributors who choose a physical perk will receive a signed Empire of Blood bookmark as well.


 
The Impact?



Contributors to this campaign can sleep with ease at night knowing they've helped solve global problems like world hunger, war, and climate change (okay, maybe actually none of that really...):
While this fundraiser is going I will be finishing up my current freelance obligations and getting what little writing I can done. If funded I will balance a very strict writing schedule with my work at Nightscape Press and finish an editor-ready draft of RISING FROM ASHES within two months of the end of this fundraiser in order to have the book edited, formatted, and ready in at least ebook format for contributors by early January. Then the process of paperback and hardcover production, ordering, signing and personalizing will take place with the goal of having all copies shipped out by the end of March at the very latest. As far as the public release goes, I have yet to decide how I will handle that. As I said earlier, a portion of these funds will go to promotion and I would like to have at least a month after the book is ready to promote it before releasing it publicly. 
Here's my prior track record as an author, editor, and publisher:
Over the past several years as a writer I have written two novels (Empire of Blood books one and two), two novellas (THE QUIET and EXIT REALITY) and over a dozen short stories for various markets and as Kindle downloads.
As an editor I have co-edited two anthologies (the Bram Stoker Award-nominated HORROR FOR GOOD: A CHARITABLE ANTHOLOGY which contributes to amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research and is available now, and NIGHTSCAPES VOLUME 1 which will be available soon) and solely edited one anthology (BLOOD TYPE: AN ANTHOLOGY OF VAMPIRE SF ON THE CUTTING EDGE which will contribute to The Cystic Fibrosis Trust and is due to be released on October 30th this year).
And as a publisher I have edited and released five novels (A REQUIEM FOR DEAD FLIES by Peter N. Dudar, the Bram Stoker Award-winning LIFE RAGE by L.L. Soares, DUNGEON BRAIN by Bram Stoker Award-winning author Benjamin Kane Ethridge, THE EVOLUTIONIST by Rena Mason, and STEALING NIGHT by Peter Giglio), three novellas (BUTTERFLY POTION by Nightmare Award-winning author Trent Zelazny, SUNFALL MANOR by Peter Giglio, and THE ANGEL OF SHADWELL by Jonathan Templar, and proofread and published one anthology (WORLD'S COLLIDER: A SHARED-WORLD ANTHOLOGY edited by Richard Salter). 
For those who might be interested, here is a breakdown of how the funds donated to this campain will be used:

$1,000 more or less will go to my Promotion and Production fund to cover the cost of hiring a professional editor, cover artwork, some other minor production costs, and to promote the book.
$2,000 more or less will go to paying for the production and shipping of the physical perks offered in this campaign as well as counting the cut that Indiegogo will take out. If this ends up costing more than 2k, the extra will come from my Promotion and Production fund, if it ends up costing less, more will go toward promotion.
$2,000 will go toward two months of living expenses to cover my bills and any possible materials I need during the two month stretch of finishing the final draft of the book.

They can project the chapter on to a screen for a group read along. They can print it out or download it to a pc or a laptop. Teachers know how their students learn best so this puts the power back into our very capable teachers' hands!</p>
<p>I am also very excited that Indiegogo has such a strong international presence because of schools outside of the U.S.A. want to give their students a glimpse of the daily life of American youth this will be a great opportunity!</p>

My profession is Western Filmmaker.  This novel is a work of historical fiction, but it stands on the shoulders of the classic Western genre in American Film.     I wrote this story for the folks I meet at Western Festivals and events where amutual bond is created over the importance of the Cowboy in our culture.  It is an unspoken brotherhood among those of us who have a Westerner within that special place in our soul.  There is an everlasting desire in this country for the tales and adventures of the American Cowboy.  His code of ethics, moral integrity, self-reliance and knowing good from bad, right from wrong seems like an exotic fanciful tale in this ever changing, fast-paced world.  A man on a horse inspires us to stop and imagine, putting our technological world away for a short moment to see clearly into the basic joys of life.  For me, I have a love for the history of the West.  Even more than that, I have a passion for the Western image created by screen legends such as Gary Cooper, James Stewart and the still most recognized star worldwide, John Wayne.  From these figures, we as an audience are taught morality tales of characters who experience the violent conflict of man, nature or self and make it through the journey of survival.I would like to acknowledge the storytellers who have carried on this great tradition.  I hope you enjoy experiencing these universal western characters as they breathe new life into a fresh adventure.  These unique personalities are of another time in the American West, but belong to us all.             Note about the Illustrations: My good friend, actor, artist and cowboy pal Al Bringas illustrated the wonderfully sketched artwork in this book.  His passion for detail and homage to the great cowboy artists is evident in his interpretation of elements from classic western art, masterfully weaving images into the fabric of our western tale. What We Need & What You GetI need YOUR help to get this book out to all the potential Western Fans!  Don't wait, get your Book and Limited Edition items now and help get the message out that the Western genre is still alive and strong. Here are the Perks -  Examples in Photo Gallery section.  Items will be mailed out in mid September 2014.  Postage in USA included - For International Shipping:  Please add $15 for postage$15 - DVD ""Friend of the Devil"" Western TV Pilot & Making of: Documentary.  Directed by EH Heisner, filmed at John Wayne's Alamo Village in Texas & the  Alabama Hills in Lone Pine, CA along with a Thank You note of support.      $30 - Hardcover First Edition Novel ""West to Bravo"" personally signed by Author Eric H.

</div><p>Dear reader! Thank you for your loyalty to the
AlterWorld. I am glad that you’ve grown fond of Max’s story. Just like you, I
want the rest of the books in the series to get published as soon as possible.
But the publication process is being hampered by the expenses and the
time-frames associated with translation.</p>
<p>The cost of translating one book ranges from $5,000 to
$10,000. The translation itself takes up to 4 months.</p>
<p>There are currently 7 books in the series that are
already written, plus additional stories. I am also working on a new LitRPG
series about outer space.</p>
<p>In response to the readers’ demands, I am opening a
crowdfunding company to raise capital for translating the rest of the books. If
we raise enough money, I will hire a second translator to speed up the process
and get the books out twice as fast! The new volumes will be released every one
and a half or two months! If we only raise a portion of the funds, this will in
any case help shorten the waiting time between the book releases. After paying
for the translation of one book, it is quite difficult for me to find another
spare $7,000 in order to instantly get the next book translated. I am forced to
save… which is long and painful…</p>
<p>There are no risks involved; the books are ALREADY
written. The only issue is translating them. Every dollar counts; it will be
put to good use! A single dollar shortens the waiting time by 10 hours!</p>
<p>Everyone who decides to help out will receive a few
wonderful volumes from the AlterWorld series as a thank-you gift: <i>The
Sense Of Duty,</i> which recounts the story of the Doc and the hospice,
and also <i>The Three Bears And The Zombie Legion, </i>the story of
how the Inferno powers came to Earth.</p>
<p>Those who give $10+ will have their names printed in
the Acknowledgement Section.</p>
<p>Those who give $30+ will receive the first book in the
series with my autograph!</p>
<p>Those who give $60+will additionally receive 3
autographed volumes!</p>
<p>If you can’t afford to donate, it’s no big deal; I am
still endlessly grateful to all of you for falling in love with the world I
have created! Besides, there are other ways to make major contributions; you
could recommend the series to your friends, write a review, or share a link to
the books on Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your support!</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Los mundos de Dalia: La instrucción</strong> se sale de los patrones habituales del género fantástico para presentarnos una historia de personajes alrededor de una trama de madurez... no te la pierdas.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Dalia es una joven adolescente de catorce años inteligente y audaz. Tras una discusión con sus compañeras de instituto acude a casa desconsolada en busca del consejo de su madre. Sin embargo, esa misma noche, Dalia será transportada a un mundo desconocido para ella donde, sin saberlo, es la última esperanza de los <i>darcols </i>ante un conflicto que lleva durando años. Allí descubrirá que es un ser imbuido por la energía al igual que Hive, quien la acompañará como guerrero en su lucha. Pero la energía no es exclusiva de ellos, sino que se manifiesta de numerosas formas y puede ser utilizada con diversos propósitos, viéndose obligada a encontrarse a sí misma para poder tomar parte en el conflicto. Será entonces cuando descubrirá que dicha energía no solo es utilizada para hacer el bien o el mal, sino que existen otras vertientes como la neutralidad, cuyos seres buscarán desesperadamente equilibrar la balanza sin importar nada más.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Los mundos de Dalia</i> pretende ser una serie de novelas de fantasía donde <i>La instrucción</i> no es más que la introducción a ese mundo lleno de fuerzas donde nadie puede asegurar quién está dispuesto a luchar por el bien, por el mal o por otros propósitos impredecibles.<br/> </p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy os presentamos a Juan Vicente Ruiz Blasco.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacido en Sevilla en agosto de 1984 crece en la localidad gaditana de Jerez de la Frontera. Afincado actualmente con su familia en Fuenlabrada, siempre tuvo inquietudes que lo llevaban a escribir casi desde que tiene uso de razón. Compaginando sus estudios y su variada vida laboral, continuaba escribiendo casi sin pausas. Pero fue en 2015 cuando su mujer y sus hijos lo animaron a escribir no solo para sí, sino para más público, cosechando así en su primer intento el premio al mejor relato corto de una pequeña localidad de la provincia madrileña. Fue desde este momento cuando se animó a escribir de manera más decidida, llegando a autopublicar en 2016 <i>El duelo de los inocentes</i>, drama que aborda la superación de una familia y amigos tras un triste accidente donde pierden a sus seres más queridos. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Pero la pasión por las aventuras y, sobre todo, por ver disfrutar a sus hijos con la lectura, fue lo que le llevó a escribir <i>Los mundos de Dalia</i> y probar así con el género de fantasía y literatura juvenil. Despertando así el interés de familiares y amigos que le animaron a emprender la aventura de la publicación y poder llegar así a un público más extenso.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«A Dalia le encantaba su habitación. La había decorado a su gusto. En las paredes tenía todo tipo posters colgados de sus películas favoritas, además de aquellos grupos de música de moda. No era demasiado grande, pero ella prefería usar el término “acogedora”. Era feliz en aquellas cuatro paredes donde su mente, insaciable e incansable, solía imaginar todo tipo de situaciones. Entre tanta decoración se podía apreciar el color amarillo en las paredes, a juego con su ropa de cama. Se puso su pijama de color rojo con ositos panda dibujados y se acostó. Estaba cansada aunque no sabía por qué extraña sensación aún se mantenía despierta. Miró el reloj. Las once y veinte.<br/>          Tras un largo período de tiempo, cuando estaba a punto de conciliar el sueño, algo llamó su atención. Una especie de sombra oscura al final de su habitación parecía perturbar su descanso. Se incorporó y pronto observó que aquella sombra no era fruto de la interrupción de la luz, sino algo tangible, algo denso. Su corazón se aceleraba. Dalia estaba a punto de descubrir una aterradora verdad. No estaba sola en su dormitorio»</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>Los mundos de Dalia: La instrucción</i> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Juan Vicente Ruiz Blasco</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>
<p>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Pero fue en 2015 cuando su mujer y sus hijos lo animaron a escribir no solo para sí, sino para más público, cosechando así en su primer intento el premio al mejor relato corto de una pequeña localidad de la provincia madrileña. Fue desde este momento cuando se animó a escribir de manera más decidida, llegando a autopublicar en 2016 El duelo de los inocentes, drama que aborda la superación de una familia y amigos tras un triste accidente donde pierden a sus seres más queridos. 
Pero la pasión por las aventuras y, sobre todo, por ver disfrutar a sus hijos con la lectura, fue lo que le llevó a escribir Los mundos de Dalia y probar así con el género de fantasía y literatura juvenil. Despertando así el interés de familiares y amigos que le animaron a emprender la aventura de la publicación y poder llegar así a un público más extenso.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«A Dalia le encantaba su habitación. La había decorado a su gusto. En las paredes tenía todo tipo posters colgados de sus películas favoritas, además de aquellos grupos de música de moda. No era demasiado grande, pero ella prefería usar el término “acogedora”. Era feliz en aquellas cuatro paredes donde su mente, insaciable e incansable, solía imaginar todo tipo de situaciones. Entre tanta decoración se podía apreciar el color amarillo en las paredes, a juego con su ropa de cama. Se puso su pijama de color rojo con ositos panda dibujados y se acostó. Estaba cansada aunque no sabía por qué extraña sensación aún se mantenía despierta. Miró el reloj. Las once y veinte.          Tras un largo período de tiempo, cuando estaba a punto de conciliar el sueño, algo llamó su atención. Una especie de sombra oscura al final de su habitación parecía perturbar su descanso. Se incorporó y pronto observó que aquella sombra no era fruto de la interrupción de la luz, sino algo tangible, algo denso. Su corazón se aceleraba. Dalia estaba a punto de descubrir una aterradora verdad. No estaba sola en su dormitorio»
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Los mundos de Dalia: La instrucción que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Juan Vicente Ruiz Blasco vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

Wider and I am the author of <u>The Worthy Wardrobe.</u> As a wardrobe stylist, I’ve been in the closets of hundreds of women, and I know first hand that getting dressed each morning is <i>never just about the clothes.</i> How we choose to dress is a direct reflection of how we feel about ourselves: our bodies, our personality, our professional and personal goals, our place in society, and our budgets.<br/><br/><u>The Worthy Wardrobe</u> explores these intersections and the complicated relationship women have with clothes. I wrote this book to help women <i>learn to love themselves</i> so that getting dressed each morning becomes a joyful experience. Part memoir, part style guide, <u>The Worthy Wardrobe</u> will help readers build a wardrobe and <i>image that reflects their inherent Worthiness.</i><br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a <i>deeper appreciation</i> for yourself and your wardrobe. In <u>The Worthy Wardrobe,</u> I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for style and spirituality in you. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you dress in a way that <i>honors your soul</i> and to find tangible tips on building a wardrobe that excites you.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about <strong>Spirituality, Style, and Shopping:</strong></p><p><strong>Spirituality:</strong> Because how we think and feel about ourselves is the foundation for<i> everything</i> we do. Each of us first must learn to love the amazing, divine, spiritual beings that we are.</p><p><strong>Style: </strong>Personal Style is a journey, not a destination. As our lives change, so do our bodies. As the way we see ourselves changes, so does the way others see us. A stylish wardrobe is about having <i>clothes that honor the person we are</i> at this point in our lives.</p><p><strong>Shopping: </strong>By investing in a wardrobe we love, we communicate to the world that our ideas, our goals, our businesses are also worthy of investment. As a personal shopper, I provide my tried and true tactics for making a <i>smart and stylish purchase.</i></p><p>You will love this book if you want to be <i>empowered when shopping and getting dressed each morning.</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong><u>The Worthy Wardrobe</u> is a non-fiction book that speaks to women of all ages and professions who are looking to finally see themselves as the beautiful, powerful, and amazing women they were created to be.</strong></p><p> </p><h2>About the Book </h2><p><u>The Worthy Wardrobe</u> is written in 4 Parts: <br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction and <strong>my personal style evolution.</strong> As a stylist, it’s assumed that I’ve always had a wonderful relationship with clothes — <i>not true at all</i>. As someone who didn’t always love how she looked, I first had to learn to love myself before I could dress myself, let alone teach anyone else how to dress. I hope that by sharing my story, you’ll see that <i>great style is obtainable for everyone</i>, including you.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> is about <strong>Perfection.</strong> The Universe created each one of us as whole and perfect beings. <i>The faster we can accept that we are all worthy and that our bodies our perfect just as they are, the sooner clothes become enjoyable.</i> In this section, I reference all kinds of spiritual concepts, from the Bible to Buddha, to establish our innate divinity. I then provide ways to find clothes to fit your unique and perfect shape and size.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> covers <strong>Purpose and Prettiness.</strong> All of us are here on Earth for a divine assignment. And whatever work we’re here to do requires that we look and feel our best. In these chapters, I discuss how so many women I've worked with used to play small with their image and how that decision impacted their professional and personal success. Backed by several studies, I make the case that<i> owning your version of pretty actually helps your professional goals.</i> I also explore how the attention of men impacts our wardrobe choices at work and social settings.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> is about <strong>Plenty.</strong> Because we live in an<i> abundant universe,</i> there’s no need to hold on to clothes that no longer serve us. Nor is is OK to opt out of investing in yourself. By letting go of the past and making wise shopping purchases, you’ll enjoy walking into your closet each morning.</p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.
