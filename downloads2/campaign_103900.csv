<p>Welcome to our Funding Dock.</p>
<p>The Game Suite is currently a concept. Our Idea is to Fully HiTechnilize (It’s a word I looked it up) Birthday Parties, Family Get together, Graduations, Sales and Grand Openings. Focusing first and foremost on Children’s Birthdays and memories.</p>
<p>[FLASHING BACK]</p>
<p>My Wife and I have 3 Daughters, they get more then the things they need. As a matter of fact my thoughts are the same as most parents, ""We all want our Children to have more than the things we did as Children"". Technology is awesome these days so much more is possible then when we were growing up in the 70's - 80's. Having said that and realizing what we all do for our children its only rational to believe all parents would do the same. Hence the market and demand is created.</p>
<p> [CURRENT DAY]</p>
<p>This is where the campaign begins, Now I've seen a few business based off of the same type of concept (All in Huge Big City Markets). The Demand is there. Now we plan to use Our Custom Design and Theme to bring the party strait to our clients door step. That could be a 7 year olds Cinderella Party or a 5 yr olds Bouncing Party. Our design and concept is to be flexible to individualize each and every client ensuing repeat business time and again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Dream (My Wife and I) is to own our business and be able to work together. To make things happen together and share these benefits financially as well as charitably. We always want to bring the smiles. Make the Memories of a Life time. Make that day they'll always talk about and remember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To be honest we are looking at this as a way to bring funding to our idea and to our dream. We’ve tried however unsuccessfully to acquire conventional loans and funding to make this happen. All roads have been dead end. Regardless of that fact we will not give up on this concept and this Goal.</li>

So, why am I posting this? I would like to bring the joys of tennis to kids who may not otherwise have the opportunity to learn this wonderful game. Once you know the basics, tennis is a sport you can play for the rest of your life. Here are a few reasons why I chose tennis
 Â· Itâ€™s fun
      Â· Itâ€™s social
      Â· It improves fitness and promotes a healthy lifestyle
 Â· It's a lifetime sport
 Â· It helps concentration and focus
 Â· Tennis courts are everywhere, especially at schools and public parks
 
In order to bring the joys abd benefits of tennis to kids that might not otherwise be exposed to it, I need to raise money for rackets and balls.
 
Once we have the needed equipment, my friends and I will teach the kids to play tennis in a fun, non-threatening yet competitive environment.
 
Please help us bring the tremendous health, fitness and psychological benefits of tennis to others.

</div></div>","Fate Of Humankind






Fate Of Humankind is an FPS conceived with a new generation engine.
The game takes the players on a journey through natural disasters such as, tornadoes and tsunamis. Over time, with further investment, additional natural disasters will be added

An outline of the many functionalities of Fate of Humankind

- First person shooter


- Natural disasters


- A new type of gameplay

- Compatible for Windows and Mac
- Only on Steam at start, and available on PS4 after
Our goal is for Fate Of Humankind to be as realistic and as stunning  as possible. With our team, we conceived a game in which you must pay attention to the natural disasters and the players, which will be very challenging.The biggest challenge for players will be to be wary of the weather. The player will not be warned of impending weather, they must use thier skills to predict when a disaster arrive. An example of this is during the Tsunami. When the sea is agitated it will be necessary to change your position, to seek higher ground. Your combat will then occur on the roofs.Alpha will consist of 30% of the total contents :- Ten weapons will be available- 3 disasters for the Alpha- Local servers - Up to 12 playersThe final game will include :- 7 Disasters - Around 30 to 50 weapons - Land vehicles (armored ...) - Complete game's original soundtrack- 10 Maps - Dedicated Server This forecast is dependent solely on the success of the proje‘Backers' will receive a pack of modelled weapons. These will be available only for the backer not sale in steamModern futuristic helmet  Version 1
Engineer Concept Version 1



Concept Sniper version 0 Warrior light armor Version 1Engineer Concept Version 2


 Warrior Version 1

 Warrior Version 2

 Warrior Version 3


 








List of the catastrophes present at the release of alpha:
- Tsunami
- Earthquake
- Tornado

In Fate Of Humankind the vehicles will be essential in certain circumstances and some maps. Army vehicles are made of strong machine-guns, resistant tires,  and an armor-plated hull so that players are protected from the catastrophes.
List of possible actions while in the vehicle:
- To repair
- To change the wheels
- To add various accessories to maximize the protection or the power of weapons

The system of “spawn” is conceived to be randomised, to make it possible for the player to have a true search. It is planned for beta release to have objects in 3D hidden to find in the debris.
The weapons, are placed at logical places, for example, a weapon will be generally found in a police station (available in final version) 

The day/night cycle will be very important.
During the day various possibilities are offered to you, among these are, to recover objects, and to kill out other players.
At night, visibility will be low. Gameplay will change completely ; the player will have to be discrete and each gesture will be important to maximize their chances of survival.


At the release of alpha Fate Of Humankind will have ten weapons available, which will be followed by regular updates. These updates will add accessories and various interactions.
Our weapons are modelled by our care, they will thus be adapted to offer a new experiment of gameplay.


Our team guarantees frequently updated We are conscious that players occasionally are reluctant to trust “early access” games, therefore,  we will set up a Dev. blog containing all the additions for the future updates.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>About The Team</h4>
<br/>
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Hello!</b></h5>
<br/>
<p>We are Dark Energy - an indie video game development studio.</p>
<p>In the studio we are 3 developers: Johnatan, Udi and Jordan. </p>
<p>We decided to <b>FRESH UP</b> the <b>real time strategy </b>with<b> King Control.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;"">King Control</h2>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>With <b>King Control</b>, the player can take over the King unit and step into battle. <br/><br/>The King unit hold the Moral for the soldiers - the higher the better. <br/>All units will operate better when high moral is kept. <br/>Keep the king alive to prevent the moral level to reset!<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433795616/xmknfudbvciuyqtxdmdt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Use the king to win by controlling it and having it sitting on the enemy throne! Be carfull, as in that time the king will be the most vulnerable, and could not be controlled for 1 minute!</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<h2 style=""text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;"">The King Control As A Game Changer:</h2>
<div>
<b>King Control</b> will be a key feature in the game. <br/><b>In order to win</b>, the player will have to use the king and have it sit on the enemy's throne.<br/>Also, players have the ability to aid attack units, thus change the endgame of <b>EVERY</b> battle! <br/>
</div>
<div>It is a fresh view for the Real Time Strategy genre. We believe that the <b>Third Person</b> elements will gain every player endless re-play-ability.  <br/><br/><b>Players will feel the epic battles that the Real Time Strategy genre has to offer like never before.</b>

<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">About The Game:</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>The game is set during the period after the expansion of the Vikings.</p>
<p>A group of Vikings were sent North to conquer new lands. Sailing for many days, they eventually  discovered the perfect settlement. Unaware that a life long curse on the land they were going to inhabit had turned the native population into hibernating dead-walkers. Now reawakened, the dead-walkers have one primary objective- the elimination of the invaders.</p>

<br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The player will build a settlement, create an army, and will take control of the land.</p>

About The Team

Hello!

We are Dark Energy - an indie video game development studio.
In the studio we are 3 developers: Johnatan, Udi and Jordan. 
We decided to FRESH UP the real time strategy with King Control.


King Control
With King Control, the player can take over the King unit and step into battle. The King unit hold the Moral for the soldiers - the higher the better. All units will operate better when high moral is kept. Keep the king alive to prevent the moral level to reset!


Use the king to win by controlling it and having it sitting on the enemy throne! Be carfull, as in that time the king will be the most vulnerable, and could not be controlled for 1 minute!


Presentation image of stepping into battle with the skeleton king model, as we do not posses the viking king model to date


The King Control As A Game Changer:

King Control will be a key feature in the game. In order to win, the player will have to use the king and have it sit on the enemy's throne.Also, players have the ability to aid attack units, thus change the endgame of EVERY battle! 

It is a fresh view for the Real Time Strategy genre. We believe that the Third Person elements will gain every player endless re-play-ability.  Players will feel the epic battles that the Real Time Strategy genre has to offer like never before.





About The Game:


The game is set during the period after the expansion of the Vikings.
A group of Vikings were sent North to conquer new lands. Sailing for many days, they eventually  discovered the perfect settlement. Unaware that a life long curse on the land they were going to inhabit had turned the native population into hibernating dead-walkers. Now reawakened, the dead-walkers have one primary objective- the elimination of the invaders.



The player will build a settlement, create an army, and will take control of the land.

In case we won't pass it for some time, we will enable to download the game from a future website we will establish.

 Moreover, if we don't reach our funding, we will have to find alternative waysto get the rest of the funding for the game.





Other Ways You Can Help

It's OK if you can't support us with money, but it doesn't mean that you can't help us!
Sometimes, a small share on a social network such as Facebook, Twiter, Google+, etc', can help more than anything.

We will be thankful should you use any

<p>The first title we’re working on is called Aztec Defence (working name only), a 2d platformer tower defence game for the PC, which focuses on constructing defences mid battle, as opposed to other tower defence titles which have instant trap building.</p>
<p>The player takes control of Tonza, an Aztec mason whose daughter was taken for the sun sacrifice. After being refused to take her place, Tonza rebels against the priests and takes control of the temple. This stopped the sacrifice, but he now must defend the temple against the gods' wrath.</p>
<p>Armed with only a bow and a hammer, Tonza must build traps and defences to hold back the invaders until the sun rises. Only through showing the townspeople that the sun will rise without sacrifice is he able to gain their support in disconnecting their town from the gods, and the priests they channel through.</p>
<p>We will be updating with a video of the game and some extra info soon.</p>

<h1>Little bit about us</h1>
<p>Immortal Games was founded by Nicholas Stone and Grant Johnson, two graduates from Qantm College Brisbane. Nick is the designer/artist and sound guy while Grant is the coding wizard.</p>
<p>We decided to try our hand at Indie development, while we we're still accustomed to living off two-minute noodles (from 2 years of fulltime of study). Why are we going PC, instead of jumping on the mobile bandwagon? Two simple answers, there is a massive amount of developers flooding the mobile market, making it harder for emerging studios to be seen, but secondly, and most importantly, is the fact that our passion is with PC development. We are using an in-house engine (The Immortal Engine), which is being developed by Grant. While this means that our initial plans are to focus on PC, the engine has been designed in a way to make adding Mac support at a later date much easier. Writing these plug-ins, however, is a lengthy process.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Why we need the money?</h1>
<p>The funding we’re asking for will allow us to focus on developing the game fulltime and purchasing a few licenses required to publish the game. In short though, we need to eat and pay rent. The amount of money raised will allow us to add more features and expand the content of the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Milestones</h1>
<h2>$2000 goal</h2>
<p>The lowest amount of money we need to complete the project is $2000. With this we will include;</p>
<ul>
<li>10 level story mode, introducing traps and enemies as the player progresses</li>
<li>5 traps, each with a variety of upgrades
<ul>
<li>Stake /arrow trap</li>
<li>Barricade</li>
<li>Thorn bush</li>
<li>Spring launcher</li>
<li>Rotating blades</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 Enemy types</li>
<li>Endless mode</li>
</ul><h2>$5000 goal</h2>
<p>The next goal is set at $5000. With this amount we will be adding;</p>
<ul>
<li>10 extra story levels</li>
<li>10 extra traps, each with a variety of upgrades
<ul>
<li>We will update and list once we finalise which traps will be included (some possible concepts for now are; wall spikes, hanging boulders (that will drop onto enemies) and villagers as AI that can block paths, attack or heal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10 extra Enemy types
<ul>
<li>We will update and list once we finalise which enemies will be included</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 masks of power
<ul>
<li>Each mask can be swapped to change the types of moves Tonza can use (Also a super special secret ability that will be totally awesome)</li>
<li>Pillar of creation mode
<ul>
<li>In this mode, player must collect resources to build and maintain a tower that is under constant attack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2>$8000+</h2>
<p>Our last goal is set at $8000 where we will be adding the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Full animated story sections</li>
<li>Extra mini-games focused on construction and defence</li>
<li>More enemies and locations</li>
</ul><p>Due to the amount of time required to add Mac support to the engine we won’t be able to create a Mac version for a while without funding well beyond the $8000 mark. We can’t tell you exactly how much as we don’t really know yet ourselves as making the game for PC is the first priority but if we get enough we will let you all know.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Rewards</h1>
<p>Design a trap: if you selected the design a trap reward there are some simple guides.</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be something that can be anchored to the ground or background wall.</li>
<li>It can’t be large than twice the width of the player and the same height (256x256px max)</li>
<li>Ideally Aztec themed would be great, but we want to let you be creative, so we aren't against mixed theme traps.</li>
<li>No copyrighted, trademarked or inappropriate material as we can’t legally include it</li>
</ol><p>Otherwise go crazy!</p>
<p>Design a monster: if you selected the monster design reward these are the guides.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limited in size to just larger than the player (128x256px or 256x128px max)</li>
<li>Ranged attacks are allowed</li>
<li>No copyrighted, trademarked or inappropriate material as we can’t legally include it</li>
</ol><div>Please note, the traps and enemies you make will not appear in the main story mode. This is due to the fact that it would make story progression and immersion very difficult if we have laser beam shooting traps, attacking 18 eyed aliens =D. Your traps and enemies will, however, show up in the other game modes for everyone to see. (We are also considering adding a 'parallel universe' version of the story mode. In which everything is exactly the same, except you are allowed to ruin the story with your custom traps =P).</div>
<p>Become a priest:<br/>If you selected to be a priest then all you have to do is email us an image of yourself or a drawing of the facial features you want the priest to have (appropriate material only) and it will be drawn up in the style of the game.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","IMAGINATION & CREATIVITY ‘THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX’The Lock Sphere is a living Sphere Mind Game/Brain Teaser -
which literally forces you to think outside the box!Measuring just three inches in diameter, the Lock Sphere
contains multiple high sensitivity sensors that can feel the slightest
vibrations to knowing the color of the sky. The Lock Sphere
empowers you to see things in a new and unique way while you have fun! It will
give you the impulse to explore creative and imaginative
everyday and abstract problems.What is Lock Sphere?Our journey started when we were looking for a
smarter game, a game that would force us to think outside the box both mentally
and physically. We wanted mind games and puzzles that incorporated today's advanced
technology. That’s what Lock Sphere is,
A New Game with No Obvious Solution.
How Does The Sphere Work ?The Sphere is shipped locked and ready to be used. It is
marked by symbols, which you will use to find the solution that will force the
Sphere to unlock and split. 
Every Sphere has its own solution. You may need to move it
to a specific place, specific conditions, certain angles, wait a certain amount
of time or any other variety of factors. The Sphere will sense everything around
you, so every step counts.Are you up for the
Challenge?
The Lock Sphere is the result of precision wood tooling on
two precise hemispheres combined with a 4mm center disc that holds the core of
the Sphere, a variety of delicate sensors and pulsating LED’s. The LED's are designed to provide beautiful ambient lightning & feedback to user about Game Progress, Stages Completed and Charging status. Paired with Soft Optic Fiber Lighting Rods that Stretches from the Center of the Sphere's to the Outer Shell - The Sphere looks like a work of art on any desk. It starts conversations, and completes a room all by itself.


The Sphere Futures:






Open Source Hardware



The EX1 Sphere is designed to have Arduino based OS. You
will be able to reprogram the system, meaning once you succeed in opening the
Sphere - You can create endless new challenging games for friends & family.


360° Sensing
Abilities  


The Sphere contains multiple high sensitivity sensors that
provides full 360 Degrees Sensing Abilities. The Sphere’s top breather holes
are precisely angled and aimed to the core of the sphere in order for the
sensors to collect info in real time.
Wireless Charging


Powered by a 3.7 Lipo battery, providing 12
Continuous Hours of Play Time and has Wireless Charging Capability with the
Supplied Charging Base. Charging the Sphere is done simply by placing the
Sphere in its base







Two Difficulty Levels


The SP Spheres have many sensors installed- but
each sphere is marked with a different single symbol that represents a hint
about how to get started. There are total of 5 SP Single Symbol Spheres - five
different and very challenging spheres to solve!

Expert mode EX1 - For the more hardcore seasoned player in us
all, the EX1 is packed with even more electronics and is fine tuned to absolute
sensing of the environment as well as location. 
It has features and sensing abilities that the SP sphere does not have.

Suitable for all ages

<p>EnGeniux is proud to introduce our new next generation game console - 
OTON X. OTON X will be the first smart autonomous game console. 
What does this mean? OTON X will be able to self-create games instantly 
within minutes without human input. No drag or drop requirements. Do you
 want to play a new 2D or 3D action game instantly? OTON X has you 
covered! How about a new racing game? Or a new 3D alien shooter game? No
 problem, OTON X can do it!  The best thing about OTON X is that all 
OTON X games are 100% free. Imagine a world where every single day you could play a new 
exclusive EnGeniux OTON X game free of charge. </p>

      </b>
</h3>
<p>
        Mod the OTON X games you play from our network or resell games 
with your own custom user content levels, characters and power-ups. Developing games for OTON X does not require any special programming 
skills. Create new worlds, new challenges and new characters then share 
the entire experience with your friends on OTON X. Need more games? 
Don’t 
worry. The OTON X console will support Linux, Android and 3rd party

<p><b>OTON X BETA</b></p>
<p>This is a 
first for a crowdfunding project. When you back the OTON X project you 
become eligible to become an OTON X beta tester to test the user 
interface, game creation and new updates. With this incentive backers 
are helping with feedback and providing suggestions as we develop the 
final hardware and software builds. We feel that while you wait on us to
 complete the project you should have the ability to login to our beta 
server and provide vital input to make this project a success. </p> <b>WHERE YOU COME IN</b><p>    We have sourced a leading contract manufacturer to develop, 
assemble and package the units to our exact specifications. However, we need
 your help to go from a working prototype to a full scale production and to
 get volume discounts so we can offer OTON X units for the lowest retail 
pricing possible. Your pledge will go towards hardware production and other 
related testing requirements. What really makes OTON X special is our 
custom operating system which goes hand-in-hand with the specialized PCB quad-core chipset. Our ten years of experience in game development and 
manufacturing will help us successfully deliver this amazing platform to our backers.  <br/></p>

<p align=""Left"">Having self-funded the entire development of the game over the past 17 years out of our own pockets we are now turning to crowdfunding to put the final polish on the game before delivering it to fans worldwide who have been waiting on the game for more than a decade. A pledge to the game will secure you a <strong>one-of-a-kind collector's edition of the resulting masterpiece</strong> and a guarantee that the completed product will be artistically perfect. Only pledges will get DRM-free copies of Grimoire once it is completed.<img alt=""Magic Hat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476664/pictures/original/20121005234156-phyrgiancone.png?1349505716"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Spellbinding!""/></p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p align=""Left"">The game is set in a world called Hyperborea, which in the early part of its history endured a savage period of unbridled warfare that nearly razed the continent.</p>
<p align=""Left"">There is a reason this state of war existed, a prime mover as it were, a force that promulgated hatred, fear and hostility. We don't find out what it is until much later in the game at the climax, but this force once threatened to destroy all relationships between living creatures in the distant past.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""Rockwyrm"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476610/pictures/original/20121005224927-rockwyrmframe.png?1349502566"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Beware the Rockwyrm!""/>The guardian of the world of Hyperborea, a minor divinity known as the White Owl and also the Winged Exemplar, knew that he had to do something to counteract the unceasing carnage before there was nothing left worth defending. He came up with a solution ... he approached the Goddess of the Moon and asked her to sacrifice the Moon Clock, also called the ""Metronome Mysterium,"" the clock that kept time for the various lunar phases. This clock would juxtapose the balance of chaos and entropy in Hyperborea with a generous measure of order, law and harmony.</p>
<p align=""Left"">After the goddess of the moon showed the White Owl how to wind the clock, he returned to the land below with it and concealed it deep within the earth, far from the eyes of mortals. Almost as soon as the clock began to keep time, the bloody wars of succession began to recede and were replaced by a loose set of peaceful alliances and territorial restrictions amongst the many races that inhabited the land. Even the martial Naga, the snake people, retreated to a distant tower across the waters and initiated no further wars on the mainland.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""Black Lich"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476616/pictures/original/20121005225303-lichframe.png?1349502782"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Superpimp of the Cenotaph!""/>The White Owl knew that he had not solved the basic problem, merely thwarted it with a sort of cosmic counterweight. He knew that if the Clock of Fate ever wound down, the wars and violence would return. Being a wise old bird but absentminded, he decided to write the secret of the Clock's location on nine stone tablets and then scatter these tablets throughout the land so that no unworthy spirit would ever find them but he could recover them when he needed them again.</p>
<p align=""Left"">The problem that developed is that the Winged Exemplar was even more absentminded than he realized - after a thousand years, he forgot where he put the tablets. Kind of like putting a string on your finger - then forgetting to look at the finger!</p>
<p align=""Left"">When we begin the game, the Clock of Fate is winding down, the harrowing shadow of war hangs over the continent and the many races have cut off contact with one another or begun engaging in skirmishes over territory and resources. There are cutthroats abroad, sinister conspiracies afoot and bizarre religious cults gaining in numbers.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""Cave Shroom"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476619/pictures/original/20121005225711-shroomframe.png?1349503030"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Hold your breath!""/>The only hope for Hyperborea of course, is for us to find the nine tablets, discover the secret hiding place of the Metronome Mysterium and wind it once again. The problem is that we are not the only ones seeking the tablets. We are competing with thieves, assassins, spies and well-intentioned busybodies who are also looking for the tablets. If they get the tablets first, we may have to fight everybody and their brother to get them back.<img alt=""Pirates"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476625/pictures/original/20121005230223-pirateframe.png?1349503343"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Scurvy Dog of the Sea!""/></p>
<p align=""Left"">Along the way we'll discover an enormous number of subplots, lessons in Hyperborean history, the underground kingdom of Samhain, demons from another plane of reality, alien bounty hunters, Shelach the Spider Queen and her one-eyed master the Psychopomp, The Ghost City of Gideon, the Soul-Eater Grendel, The Tower of Bahomet and probably have to kill several discount local gods to succeed, as well as a wide array of mythical beasts native to the continent.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What was the original design philosophy behind the game?</h3>
</div>
<h3><em>""CORE PRINCIPLES""</em></h3>
<div>We wrote these down in January 1995 and have referred back to them constantly as the bible in creating the Grimoire universe ...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<img alt=""Bitey Fish Jr."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/477902/pictures/full/20121006211452-fishframe.png?1349583305"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;"" title=""Watch out for bitey fish!""/>The point of this game is to have fun inside a huge, sprawling fantasy adventure that is so immersive it serves as a completely shameless escape from the real world that lasts a long, long time. It should not try to be an action game, an FPS shooter, a puzzle game or a hidden object game. It should stick to being a turn-based 1st person fantasy roleplaying game. Nothing should be calculated for its appeal, rather the acid test is does it make the game more fun and more interesting. Everything else must go.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The game must never look like it was under adult supervision at any point. <img alt=""Knight Hit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/477903/pictures/full/20121006211523-knightframe.png?1349583330"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 2px;""/>The world of Grimoire will contain many incongruous elements from different aspects of sci-fi, fantasy and even horror. The purpose of this fantasy is to be fantastic in Grimoire. Nothing should be judged worthwhile because of what people say or whether it conforms to any genre. The only requirement is for this world to be true to itself and to the vision of it's author. Whether or not anybody finds it appealing will be determined by the reaction to the game when it is released.</div>
<div>
<p align=""Left"">There must never be anything that can be done at any time during gameplay or anything that can occur that can mess up game logic so badly that the game cannot be completed.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Do not construct linear frames of reference that assume the player has proceeded along one narrow path of events before they arrive at a given cell or generate a particular event. Avoid constructing rails that the player has to follow to advance in the game.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""The Hood!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476629/pictures/original/20121005230452-hoodframe.png?1349503491"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Bowman for backup!""/>Never enforce solutions of any one puzzle in a predefined way. All puzzles and challenges should have at least one alternative way of being solved. The obstacles to further progression that have only one solution should be in the minority.</p>
<p align=""Left"">The scenario must permit almost any avenue of exploration to be chosen at any time. No challenge should frustrate the player to where they feel obliged to give up. It should be easy to return to any area or puzzle whenever the player desires.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Moral or reasonable behaviour should be encouraged according to the same incentives present in real life but no penalties should ever apply for immoral or destructive behaviour. Each and any style of play should be open and unfettered, restricted only by the natural hazards the player creates for themselves.</p>
<p align=""Left"">A large part of the gameplay and scenario is to be reserved purely for discovery and delight. It should be possible to play the game many times without finding some of the very best treasures, encounters and areas.<img alt=""Wraith"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476632/pictures/original/20121005230727-wraithframe.png?1349503647"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""You can't touch this!""/></p>
<p align=""Left"">The items are to be protected by a lock that forbids their sale if they are critical. An optional configuration should notify the player if they attempt to drop a critical item. Likewise, an item once used for it's intended purpose in a critical regard to completion of the game, if it does not vanish, should then become marked as uncritical and be available to sell for profit or discard at will.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Non-Player opposition characters should not gain access to critical areas and items until the player has opened these routes by exploring those venues. This will keep tensions riding high and make advantages either way seem very marginal. Non-Player characters should not behave in any fashion that indicates that they have any more information than the player about locations, items and solutions to puzzles. The Non-Player AI should operate within the same limitations as the players themselves.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Maps must always be designed with spaces in mind, not merely collections of corridors or tunnels interrupted by rooms. This is the first principle of all good architecture. Think of the way the various spaces relate to each other and what common factors make them all part of the same place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<img alt=""Null Space Demon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476636/pictures/original/20121005230937-nullframe.png?1349503777"" src="""" style="""" title=""From another world!""/><br/> </div>

Review Of Grimoire Gameplay On YouTube
Update #1 : Sooper Seekret Teknologee Review
Having self-funded the entire development of the game over the past 17 years out of our own pockets we are now turning to crowdfunding to put the final polish on the game before delivering it to fans worldwide who have been waiting on the game for more than a decade. A pledge to the game will secure you a one-of-a-kind collector's edition of the resulting masterpiece and a guarantee that the completed product will be artistically perfect. Only pledges will get DRM-free copies of Grimoire once it is completed.
Grimoire is a turn-based, 3D, first person perspective roleplaying adventure in 1024x768 256 Color graphics. The 3D step-based engine is pixel perfect and smooth scrolling with zero distortion handcrafted images.
The style of play is very similar to that of CRPGS during the golden age of computer roleplaying before 1992 like Eye of the Beholder, Bane of the Cosmic Forge, Crusaders of the Dark Savant, Might & Magic, The Bard's Tale, Stonekeep and other classic games.
The emphasis in the game is on the story, exploration, discovery, character advancement, puzzle solving, strategic phased combat, treasure hunting, inventory management and interaction with the non-player characters encountered during play.
Noteworthy Features:

600 hours of play possible in a single game
244+ Maps in the game to explore!

The Story


The game is set in a world called Hyperborea, which in the early part of its history endured a savage period of unbridled warfare that nearly razed the continent.
There is a reason this state of war existed, a prime mover as it were, a force that promulgated hatred, fear and hostility. We don't find out what it is until much later in the game at the climax, but this force once threatened to destroy all relationships between living creatures in the distant past.
The guardian of the world of Hyperborea, a minor divinity known as the White Owl and also the Winged Exemplar, knew that he had to do something to counteract the unceasing carnage before there was nothing left worth defending. He came up with a solution ... he approached the Goddess of the Moon and asked her to sacrifice the Moon Clock, also called the ""Metronome Mysterium,"" the clock that kept time for the various lunar phases. This clock would juxtapose the balance of chaos and entropy in Hyperborea with a generous measure of order, law and harmony.
After the goddess of the moon showed the White Owl how to wind the clock, he returned to the land below with it and concealed it deep within the earth, far from the eyes of mortals. Almost as soon as the clock began to keep time, the bloody wars of succession began to recede and were replaced by a loose set of peaceful alliances and territorial restrictions amongst the many races that inhabited the land. Even the martial Naga, the snake people, retreated to a distant tower across the waters and initiated no further wars on the mainland.
The White Owl knew that he had not solved the basic problem, merely thwarted it with a sort of cosmic counterweight. He knew that if the Clock of Fate ever wound down, the wars and violence would return. Being a wise old bird but absentminded, he decided to write the secret of the Clock's location on nine stone tablets and then scatter these tablets throughout the land so that no unworthy spirit would ever find them but he could recover them when he needed them again.
The problem that developed is that the Winged Exemplar was even more absentminded than he realized - after a thousand years, he forgot where he put the tablets. Kind of like putting a string on your finger - then forgetting to look at the finger!
When we begin the game, the Clock of Fate is winding down, the harrowing shadow of war hangs over the continent and the many races have cut off contact with one another or begun engaging in skirmishes over territory and resources. There are cutthroats abroad, sinister conspiracies afoot and bizarre religious cults gaining in numbers.
The only hope for Hyperborea of course, is for us to find the nine tablets, discover the secret hiding place of the Metronome Mysterium and wind it once again. The problem is that we are not the only ones seeking the tablets. We are competing with thieves, assassins, spies and well-intentioned busybodies who are also looking for the tablets. If they get the tablets first, we may have to fight everybody and their brother to get them back.
Along the way we'll discover an enormous number of subplots, lessons in Hyperborean history, the underground kingdom of Samhain, demons from another plane of reality, alien bounty hunters, Shelach the Spider Queen and her one-eyed master the Psychopomp, The Ghost City of Gideon, the Soul-Eater Grendel, The Tower of Bahomet and probably have to kill several discount local gods to succeed, as well as a wide array of mythical beasts native to the continent.

 

What was the original design philosophy behind the game?

""CORE PRINCIPLES""
We wrote these down in January 1995 and have referred back to them constantly as the bible in creating the Grimoire universe ...
 

The point of this game is to have fun inside a huge, sprawling fantasy adventure that is so immersive it serves as a completely shameless escape from the real world that lasts a long, long time. It should not try to be an action game, an FPS shooter, a puzzle game or a hidden object game. It should stick to being a turn-based 1st person fantasy roleplaying game. Nothing should be calculated for its appeal, rather the acid test is does it make the game more fun and more interesting. Everything else must go.
 
The game must never look like it was under adult supervision at any point. The world of Grimoire will contain many incongruous elements from different aspects of sci-fi, fantasy and even horror. The purpose of this fantasy is to be fantastic in Grimoire. Nothing should be judged worthwhile because of what people say or whether it conforms to any genre. The only requirement is for this world to be true to itself and to the vision of it's author. Whether or not anybody finds it appealing will be determined by the reaction to the game when it is released.

There must never be anything that can be done at any time during gameplay or anything that can occur that can mess up game logic so badly that the game cannot be completed.
Do not construct linear frames of reference that assume the player has proceeded along one narrow path of events before they arrive at a given cell or generate a particular event. Avoid constructing rails that the player has to follow to advance in the game.
Never enforce solutions of any one puzzle in a predefined way. All puzzles and challenges should have at least one alternative way of being solved. The obstacles to further progression that have only one solution should be in the minority.
The scenario must permit almost any avenue of exploration to be chosen at any time. No challenge should frustrate the player to where they feel obliged to give up. It should be easy to return to any area or puzzle whenever the player desires.
Moral or reasonable behaviour should be encouraged according to the same incentives present in real life but no penalties should ever apply for immoral or destructive behaviour. Each and any style of play should be open and unfettered, restricted only by the natural hazards the player creates for themselves.
A large part of the gameplay and scenario is to be reserved purely for discovery and delight. It should be possible to play the game many times without finding some of the very best treasures, encounters and areas.
The items are to be protected by a lock that forbids their sale if they are critical. An optional configuration should notify the player if they attempt to drop a critical item. Likewise, an item once used for it's intended purpose in a critical regard to completion of the game, if it does not vanish, should then become marked as uncritical and be available to sell for profit or discard at will.
Non-Player opposition characters should not gain access to critical areas and items until the player has opened these routes by exploring those venues. This will keep tensions riding high and make advantages either way seem very marginal. Non-Player characters should not behave in any fashion that indicates that they have any more information than the player about locations, items and solutions to puzzles. The Non-Player AI should operate within the same limitations as the players themselves.
Maps must always be designed with spaces in mind, not merely collections of corridors or tunnels interrupted by rooms. This is the first principle of all good architecture. Think of the way the various spaces relate to each other and what common factors make them all part of the same place.


 
If you're wondering why we claim Grimoire is one of the greatest classic style fantasy roleplaying games ever created, look at this comparison with other classic RPGs and decide for yourself if Grimoire really is the largest, richest, most detailed and complex computer roleplaying game ever made.

<p align=""justify"">Firstly, allow us to humbly introduce ourselves, we are Softnetix Entertainment, a small indie game development team.  We are  very passionate about games and having played numerous online/offline fantasy games, we decided to come together to develop our own game. The Dimiria Project is our pioneer project and we started it because we wanted to create a game that is not only enjoyable and exciting to play, but also somewhat unique than the rest of similar titles. </p>

<p align=""justify"">Dimiria: The Agrarian Falls is a single player 3D action packed RPG (role playing game) based an original story written by Dylan Tan (that’s me!) and David McCrae. Dimiria uses a dark medieval fantasy theme and it’s based on an adventure story about the rise of a group of heroes who, together, set out to save the kingdom.  </p>

<h3 align=""justify""><span style=""color: #0e78e2;"">WHAT ARE THE FUNDS BEING SPENT ON?</span></h3>
<p align=""justify"">Since the inception of this project thus far, the project has been almost 100% self funded, and while we do have sufficient funds to see us through to the final stages of development, additional funds would be required to put in the finishing touches and also to launch the game itself. At the time of this writing, Dimiria is already at Pre-Alpha stage and  we estimate that by the end of this campaign (next 30 days), we will reach late Alpha stage and possibly reaching to an early Beta.  We have put a lot of effort into making this game and we are still working hard to make this a better game. The main plot, storyboard and design are all complete, however there is still work to be done to further fix bugs, polishing, and optimization and this also adding additional features into the game. <br/><br/> In the next coming months (after the funds being raised), we will start looking into further enhancing and polishing the world maps/landscape even further, improving the character motion (i.e. animation), adding more special effects (i.e. particle effects for spells, and as such), unique sounds (i.e. sound FX), character voices (to give life to the characters), and of course impactful music. The fund would also be used to purchase additional arts and digital assets, and additional technology for the game. The more funds we have, the better polish the game would be and we hope to create an outstanding game both in term of graphics and gameplay. <br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.dimiria.com/images/campaign/dimiria7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/> We will provide weekly updates exclusively to indiegogo backers. We are committed to total transparency, ensuring that backers get accurate information regarding game development. There will also be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project and air their thoughts regarding the game's content and direction. Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available. Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version.</p>
<h3 align=""justify""><span style=""color: #0e78e2;"">REWARDS FOR OUR CONTRIBUTORS</span></h3>
<p align=""justify"">This whole experience is being offered for a backer contribution of at least $15. For anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond this amount, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from Premium/Special Edition Box, Unique Posters, T-Shirts and original Hard Cover Concept Art (which include summary of each chapters), and all will be signed by us. These items are EXCLUSIVE only for the campaign and won't be made available after the game is launched. We are going with digital distribution via games distribution portal when the game is ready for launch. <br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dimiria.com/images/campaign/campaigns_goods.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/> We would have to charge an additional fee for all international addresses wishing to receive the perks for the $30 and above. For those levels, please add a $15 flat shipping fee to your pledge. We are so sorry for the inconvenience…</p>
<h3 align=""justify""><span style=""color: #0e78e2;"">FREQUENT ASKED QUESTION (FAQ)</span></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span style=""color: #80281a;""><strong>Q: So how the gameplay going to be like?</strong></span><br/> A: There three main elements to Dimiria’s gameplay, which is sound familiar to any RPG fan: exploration, combat, and questing.

Firstly, allow us to humbly introduce ourselves, we are Softnetix Entertainment, a small indie game development team.  We are  very passionate about games and having played numerous online/offline fantasy games, we decided to come together to develop our own game. The Dimiria Project is our pioneer project and we started it because we wanted to create a game that is not only enjoyable and exciting to play, but also somewhat unique than the rest of similar titles. 

WHAT IS DIMIRIA ALL ABOUT?
Dimiria: The Agrarian Falls is a single player 3D action packed RPG (role playing game) based an original story written by Dylan Tan (that’s me!) and David McCrae. Dimiria uses a dark medieval fantasy theme and it’s based on an adventure story about the rise of a group of heroes who, together, set out to save the kingdom.  
Feature of Dimiria:


DRM-Free, and available on PC and Mac


Not another generic fantasy RPG. The world of Dimiria is anything but boring. We have spent countless hours in studying, planning and revising the world of Dimiria with one goal in mind, and that is to make Dimiria interesting, different and importantly exciting to play. 


Awesome Fast pace action oriented combat with companions! There are three classes of heroes that player could choose from (the Fighter, Mage and Rogue). Each of these heroes has their own set of specialties and abilities, leading to unique gameplay. The player will encounter a total of eight companions throughout the course of the game. These companions will during all subsequent quests, fight alongside the player.


Travel across various and carefully crafted landscapes. Explore the widely varied terrain of Dimiria, rugged mountains, scorching deserts and hazardous jungles. Embark on an epic quest to save Dimiria from the havoc and destruction that besets the kingdom of Andhere Terrae. With a group of loyal friends fend off the invasion of the Hiristian army.


Emphasis on story. Dimiria is a thrilling dark fantasy story with danger lurking round every corner. Rampant with magic and incredible creatures, we promise an interesting plot and unique gameplay.

If you interested to find a little more about our game, we have a lots more information published at our official website (www.dimiria.com).   Please feel free to visit us there :)
 Carefully Crafted Landscape Never give up, never surrender!Taste of my wrath!
WHAT ARE THE FUNDS BEING SPENT ON?
Since the inception of this project thus far, the project has been almost 100% self funded, and while we do have sufficient funds to see us through to the final stages of development, additional funds would be required to put in the finishing touches and also to launch the game itself. At the time of this writing, Dimiria is already at Pre-Alpha stage and  we estimate that by the end of this campaign (next 30 days), we will reach late Alpha stage and possibly reaching to an early Beta.  We have put a lot of effort into making this game and we are still working hard to make this a better game. The main plot, storyboard and design are all complete, however there is still work to be done to further fix bugs, polishing, and optimization and this also adding additional features into the game.  In the next coming months (after the funds being raised), we will start looking into further enhancing and polishing the world maps/landscape even further, improving the character motion (i.e. animation), adding more special effects (i.e. particle effects for spells, and as such), unique sounds (i.e. sound FX), character voices (to give life to the characters), and of course impactful music. The fund would also be used to purchase additional arts and digital assets, and additional technology for the game. The more funds we have, the better polish the game would be and we hope to create an outstanding game both in term of graphics and gameplay.  We will provide weekly updates exclusively to indiegogo backers. We are committed to total transparency, ensuring that backers get accurate information regarding game development. There will also be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project and air their thoughts regarding the game's content and direction. Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available. Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version.
REWARDS FOR OUR CONTRIBUTORS
This whole experience is being offered for a backer contribution of at least $15. For anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond this amount, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from Premium/Special Edition Box, Unique Posters, T-Shirts and original Hard Cover Concept Art (which include summary of each chapters), and all will be signed by us. These items are EXCLUSIVE only for the campaign and won't be made available after the game is launched. We are going with digital distribution via games distribution portal when the game is ready for launch.  We would have to charge an additional fee for all international addresses wishing to receive the perks for the $30 and above. For those levels, please add a $15 flat shipping fee to your pledge. We are so sorry for the inconvenience…
FREQUENT ASKED QUESTION (FAQ)
Q: So how the gameplay going to be like? A: There three main elements to Dimiria’s gameplay, which is sound familiar to any RPG fan: exploration, combat, and questing. While exploring, you’ll control a single hero (in third person, over-the-shoulder view which can be rotated around the active character) who explores various unique lands, caverns, dungeons and castles while fighting large numbers of enemies and collecting equipments, gold, and other items. The player assumes the role of a warrior, mage or rogue.   
Q: Where do I join the discussion community?A: Right over http://dimiria.com/index.php/component/users/?v.... Just make sure to use the same email account associated with your indiegogo account.
Q: What happens if you go over the goal? A: The extra money will be put back into the game. The higher it goes, the better we could make the game!
Q: When can I expect the game to be finished? A: We were aiming to finish in November of 2012, but if in light of the increased budget, we're planning on expanding production to ensure we make the best game possible.
Q: What are the system requirements for Dimira?A: While we don't yet know the exact numbers (and we're still actively optimizing the game). We'll give you specifics as soon as we know ourselves.
Q: What are the guidelines for Naming NPC, Weapon, Location or Quest?A: To keep it simple we'd like to keep it to three (3) simple guidelines:

No sexual content (sorry). That means no genitals, innuendo or implied phallus hidden in the negative space.
No trademarked or otherwise plagiarized name for character names, location.
Try to keep things in a vaguely appropriate theme and “Non-modern” theme. For mini quest, it should be parallel with the main story medieval fantasy theme. We could not and will not make unrealistic quest such as “fly a plane” but as long it is doable, we will figure out a way to do them.

A few friends start chatting about what they think would make a great game, then someone says Why
not? Lets do it!</b></p>
<p><b>What makes our story more interesting is that we actually did it!</b></p>
<p>In 2012, <a href=""http://www.universe-online.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Universe Online (UO)</a> was officially launched and has evolved into an exceptional online space strategy game with an active and vocal (which is why we
love you!) game community. It took MANY years and lots of trial and error, but we think we finally got the game formula right.<br/><br/>Now
we want to start all over again with a new lore and medieval theme... but this time, instead of taking years to create, we're asking for your help through this campaign.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/730222/files/20140720021558-Banner01.jpg?1405847758"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Nocturion is a medieval world that resembles our own - with a darker twist. You, as an inhabitant of
Nocturion, will build strongholds and populate them with buildings and armies to defend themselves as you grow your influence over the world.</p>
<p>But of course, you are not alone.</p>
<p>You will encounter necromancers and their armies, conclaves of ghosts, vampire lairs, haunted towers, undead wizards and, well, dragons. Some of these
beings may be hostile, while others can be subjugated into serving as a supernatural army.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Surrounding Nocturion are the Elemental Planes. The rulers of these planes are hostile, raging war with one another,
which is why they are leaving Nocturion alone... for now.</p>

<p>When you play, you become part of a game community where there is no hierarchy between developers and players. Every opinion matters because making an exceptional strategy game is the goal over everything else<br/></p>

<p>Nocturion is a massive, multiplayer strategy game, played in a browser, and aimed at a mature audience. Players will assume the roles of heroes 
who build their empires by commanding armies, improving their skills, and forging alliances. Your success will be determined by your
ability to plan and execute tactical strategies and your attention to detail.</p>
<p>At the beginning, you will focus on creating a productive stronghold capable of mining the countryside for valuable resources and producing armies to help you raid the dungeons around your area for crafting materials and hidden treasures.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/812767/files/20140826035352-InterfaceD07.jpg?1409050432"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>At the same time, using your alchemists, you will try to unlock new technologies that will in turn allow you to build bigger and stronger armies.</p>
<p>The game supports <b>any kind</b> of game style you want. We aim for casual (PvE), which means that you can choose to play it at your own pace, facing only the game's villains, completing missions, and following a very exciting campaign/scenario. If on the other hand you feel that you are up to it, you can engage in PvP (Player vs Player) combat trying to prove yourself versus your opponents. It is always your own choice!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/730224/files/20140720021651-Banner03.jpg?1405847811"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><b>Original story:</b></i> Nocturion's lore spans hundreds of years with original geography,
history, noble houses and politics, warring factions and influences, supernatural enemies, dragons and more.</p>
<p><i><b>Strategy combined with role-playing:</b></i> Players must be tactical in building their cities to help the
weakened emperor survive the day. As the game progresses, players uncover clues, and soon become entangled in the epic clashes that shape the world.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/812772/files/20140826035853-Equipment.png?1409050733"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><i><b>Influences:</b></i> Battle your opponents in the political arena increasing your influences in areas such as Research, Finance, Trade and Construction.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/812765/files/20140826035305-influences.png?1409050385"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><i><b>Reputations:</b></i> Karma comes after everyone eventually. Player actions affect their
reputation with various factions (such as noble houses or the emperor), which alters their skills accordingly.</p>
<p><i><b>Pets (Companions):</b></i> Players may collect companions, which enhance their skills. Companions may be trained to become stronger and compete in the Pet Arena.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/812762/files/20140826035216-PetTrainingFacilityA05.jpg?1409050336"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><i><b>PvP:</b></i> Nocturion is built for strategic, casual play. Aggressive players, however, may attack others to steal resources and conquer cities. Less direct players may attempt to claim bounties issued by the emperor against renegades. It is <b>your</b> choice whether you activate the PvP mode or not! You can play our game without ever engaging in PvP battles.</p>
<p><i><b>Guilds (Alliances):</b></i> You can create your own alliance or join alliances created by other players. Once inside an alliance you gain access to powerful special talents that will help you defeat your enemies. Every alliance has it's own Chat Room and Forum to make communication between it's members easier. Furthermore you have your own ""Bank"" where you can store resources and help each other out. Last but not least, there are special parts of the game that are only accessible if you are a member of an Alliance.</p>

updates and game secrets!</p></div>","www.nocturion.comIt sounds like the usual Indie game story. A few friends start chatting about what they think would make a great game, then someone says Why
not? Lets do it!
What makes our story more interesting is that we actually did it!
In 2012, Universe Online (UO) was officially launched and has evolved into an exceptional online space strategy game with an active and vocal (which is why we
love you!) game community. It took MANY years and lots of trial and error, but we think we finally got the game formula right.Now
we want to start all over again with a new lore and medieval theme... but this time, instead of taking years to create, we're asking for your help through this campaign.

Nocturion is a medieval world that resembles our own - with a darker twist. You, as an inhabitant of
Nocturion, will build strongholds and populate them with buildings and armies to defend themselves as you grow your influence over the world.
But of course, you are not alone.
You will encounter necromancers and their armies, conclaves of ghosts, vampire lairs, haunted towers, undead wizards and, well, dragons. Some of these
beings may be hostile, while others can be subjugated into serving as a supernatural army.
And this is just the beginning.
Surrounding Nocturion are the Elemental Planes. The rulers of these planes are hostile, raging war with one another,
which is why they are leaving Nocturion alone... for now.

When you play, you become part of a game community where there is no hierarchy between developers and players. Every opinion matters because making an exceptional strategy game is the goal over everything else
UO player testimonials:




""I am looking forward to this game very much. I have played Universe Online and not only is it an outstanding game, the developers are always looking for ways to improve their game and I expect Nocturion will be no different. Keep up the good work guys!"" - SirBartox






“Kudos to the devs... I cannot believe how responsive you folks have been to player suggestions. I am looking forward to all future expansions! Again you guys KUDOS!!!!!!!!” - Otodus obliquus




“...the devs of this game are a whole lot better than 80% of the games out there. They are kind, let a lot slide that others would crack down on and restrict making the game bad, are quick to answer any concerns u have, and generally care about people of this game and not just making half the game for only money people.” - Aqwia1





“This game has been developed carefully (and I can see, sometimes painfully) by one of the most CUSTOMER FRIENDLY and RESPONSIVE team of Developers. It has evolved and will continue to do so!
Those true to the game, and often pushed to side when offering guidance to newer players, learned long ago how much work the Devs have gone through; and though we and the Devs may not always agree, they have ALWAYS had an open ear to our issues (complaints, whines, moans and groans) and most importantly... OUR suggestions for game improvement!!!
To the Devs...I lower my staff! Well done my friends!” - ICT_Ranger





“Absolutely spot on! Most members of our allicance have been around for more than 3 years. We have seen players come and go, we were there while the game developed its “story”, and we will probably be here for the next “surprises” that the developers-story tellers have in mind. We all must consider that this game doesn't end!!! There are no alt servers, no seasons. The story goes on. Let's enjoy playing.” - khatzi




“[Another feature is> the forum, as there are great players in this game who are willing to help new & older players alike. The Dev Team is 2nd to none! Overall a very good game which is working on getting better & responds to player issues.” - Johnny Reb

 

Nocturion is a massive, multiplayer strategy game, played in a browser, and aimed at a mature audience. Players will assume the roles of heroes 
who build their empires by commanding armies, improving their skills, and forging alliances. Your success will be determined by your
ability to plan and execute tactical strategies and your attention to detail.
At the beginning, you will focus on creating a productive stronghold capable of mining the countryside for valuable resources and producing armies to help you raid the dungeons around your area for crafting materials and hidden treasures.
At the same time, using your alchemists, you will try to unlock new technologies that will in turn allow you to build bigger and stronger armies.
The game supports any kind of game style you want. We aim for casual (PvE), which means that you can choose to play it at your own pace, facing only the game's villains, completing missions, and following a very exciting campaign/scenario. If on the other hand you feel that you are up to it, you can engage in PvP (Player vs Player) combat trying to prove yourself versus your opponents. It is always your own choice!

Original story: Nocturion's lore spans hundreds of years with original geography,
history, noble houses and politics, warring factions and influences, supernatural enemies, dragons and more.
Strategy combined with role-playing: Players must be tactical in building their cities to help the
weakened emperor survive the day. As the game progresses, players uncover clues, and soon become entangled in the epic clashes that shape the world.
Technology Research: Use your alchemists and blacksmiths to unlock the mysteries of the arcane powers and gain access to stronger units and pets.
Crafting: Players discover recipes and craft items to enhance their game actions.
Influences: Battle your opponents in the political arena increasing your influences in areas such as Research, Finance, Trade and Construction.Reputations: Karma comes after everyone eventually. Player actions affect their
reputation with various factions (such as noble houses or the emperor), which alters their skills accordingly.
Pets (Companions): Players may collect companions, which enhance their skills. Companions may be trained to become stronger and compete in the Pet Arena.PvP: Nocturion is built for strategic, casual play. Aggressive players, however, may attack others to steal resources and conquer cities. Less direct players may attempt to claim bounties issued by the emperor against renegades. It is your choice whether you activate the PvP mode or not! You can play our game without ever engaging in PvP battles.
Guilds (Alliances): You can create your own alliance or join alliances created by other players. Once inside an alliance you gain access to powerful special talents that will help you defeat your enemies. Every alliance has it's own Chat Room and Forum to make communication between it's members easier. Furthermore you have your own ""Bank"" where you can store resources and help each other out. Last but not least, there are special parts of the game that are only accessible if you are a member of an Alliance.

If you've been following Nocturion's progress (via Facebook, Twitter,
blog), you may have seen that we've been slowly creating graphics,
writing lore, and planning... lots and lots of planning! We would love to have the game ready this Summer, but covering the cost
ourselves is challenging.
Through this campaign we hope to cover the initial costs of the game. This
includes graphics and servers - not salaries and marketing.
We have come up with some perks that we hope will entice you to contribute and become part of Nocturion.








The Goblin
A very powerful pet that will accompany you from your first steps in the game until you reach levels as high as 50(!)
It's attributes make it a formiddable opponent in the arena and a highly valuable companion in your quests.
The ""Goblin"" is available only through this IndieGoGo campaign!










The Battle Armour
This special armour will grant you with high attribute bonuses comparable to bonuses provided by high level armours available in the game!
The ""Battle Armour"" is available only through this IndieGoGo campaign!










Millions of CPs
Purchase the ""Coin Master"" perk and you will have enough Character Points (CPs) to enjoy the game at your own pace!
The actual value of the CPs will be $150 when the game launches, so you do get more than 30% discount if you help our campaign!










Be part of Nocturion
If you want to play a significant role in shaping the game itself, you can become a Story Teller, writing your own story inside the game!
Meet our great develoment team and become part of our upcoming ""Behind the Scenes"" game promo video!

<p>We are players who are not satisfied by playing games that you can finish in 6 hours and you switch on the multiplayer when you have really nothing else to do. We have an 8 year experience in game industry, modelling, animating and programming that we want to show in a new game we call Face 2 Face (F2F). It´s an FPS simulator which is concentrated on quality of playing and the game´s design is secondary (not vice versa). We will be very happy if you help us to make it real.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About Face 2 Face</strong></h3>
<p>F2F is a first-person online multiplayer game which takes place in different parts of the world. Great effects, details of weapons, vehicles, sophisticated functions and real hitboxes make this game a brilliant experience. The game itself does not have a story, although the stories will be different in online tournaments. We can release the first playable version of our game in the first quarter of 2014.</p>
<p><em><strong>These are the main systems of the game:</strong></em></p>
<p>Deathmatch – public: Everyone plays for himself and everyone is an enemy</p>
<p>Capture the flag : Steal your enemy´s flag and get it safely to your area</p>
<p>Search &amp; Destroy : You have to conquer your enemy and destroy his area</p>
<p>TT : This system is used only in tournaments. It is a system where you have limited numbers of vehicles and ammo during the whole tournament.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Some in-game functions:</strong></p>
<p>Your vehicles can be out of fuel – you can fill it in the gas station</p>
<p>Reward system – rewards that open new weapons and enhancements</p>
<p>Clan system – creating, editing and searching for teams according to your criteria</p>
<p>You can throw your enemy´s grenades back</p>
<p>The skins of your characters can be edited in your team colors</p>
<p>And another two special functions that will be published in the test version.</p>
<p>There are much more functions in this game of course, but it will be better if you play it yourself. The game is not classic, it is not from that kind of games the market is oversaturated with. The screenshots from the game can prove that. All in-game screenshots are published only for Indiegogo campaign.</p>

 Scottish Highland Games are the traditional sports of Scotland.  Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, we have our own running of the Games with events through the Spring, Summer and Fall. Our season opener is on April 18th, 2015.  Stones, Hammers, Weights and Cabers will fly!  We want to bring Team Scotland to Fremont, California to compete against the best that California has to offer. Who is Team Scotland?Garry Hagan,   from Bathgate, Scotland ... Champion at Taynuilt Highland Games, 2014  Kyle Robert Randalls, from Grangemouth, Scotland... 2014 World Amateur Scottish Hammer Champion!Jamie Gunn, from Halkirk Scotland... 2014 Glenfiddich Juniors  Champion!Who  is Team California?Robert Krieger, from Hayward California... 2014 Ardenwood  Highland Games and 2014 Woodland  Highland Games ChampionChristopher Hurts, from Hayward California... 2014 Ardenwood Highland Games Athlete of the Day.Chance Allard,  from Pleasanton... 2014 Dixon Highland Games Champion 
With your help, we can bring three outstanding athletes from Scotland here to the Bay Area for the best in Highland Games competition.     What We Need 
 We need to fly three athletes here from Scotland, then house and feed them for a week.   Round-trip flights from Scotland to the San Francisco  Bay Area are running about $1,000 per person.  The hotel will cost about  another $1,000.  We have $1,000 in other fundraising planned already. So to make this happen, we need $3,000 in help from you.
  Can We Really Do This?

We got tired of bowing to the monolithic men with the money and wanted to work with people who care about the quality of the product. We are people with passion that intend to make solid, addictive, kick ass games, without a whiff of BS. And who are our big executive partners in this effort…? YOU! Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn, is where it all begins.In 1994, a well-known publisher released a fighting game starring a then 22-year old basketball superstar by the name of Shaquille O’ Neal.  Capitalizing on his immense popularity, the publisher allowed the game to be released with numerous shortcomings.  In many circles, the game has become a cult-classic, attaining the status of “so bad its good” and even prompting one fan to dedicate a website, ShaqFu.com to the destruction of all remaining copies of the game.No! Definitely not! There are two, and only two, similarities between our Shaq Fu, and the abomination that was born in the nineties: The name, and the starring character.We are gamers, not executives. We know what’s good and we know what stinks. This isn’t about trying to make a quick buck, it’s about creating something that both we and Shaq can be proud of. We want to make a slick, fun, rock-solid game.We’ve assembled a team of creative people who have this vision at the heart of what they do and we’re really excited about this. We want you to be a part of that excitement and a part of this awesome project.Most celebrity games take a well known face and build a crappy game around it, knowing it will sell. We want to build a game that would kick ass even without Shaq. As the main character, however, Shaq, really wants to be a part of this and we love that he’s onboard. He's going to have a huge involvement in this and he is not about to let the same mistake happen twice, and neither are we.He is the best center ever to play the game.  Of course he's got money, and yes he will be investing a lot of his own time and money in this project.  We will be investing considerably more of our own money in the game than we are asking for.The purpose of bringing the game to the public is to see how much interest there is in becoming Shaq’s partner and in seeing the game happen.  In exchange for your help, Shaq, is offering unprecedented access to his life with incredible perks.  Here are some highlights:
Bag a signed original size 22 Shaq Attack sneaker!
Play basketball with Shaq, on his own court, at his house!
Have Shaq, become your personal secretary by recording your voicemail!
Have lunch or dinner with the big man for you and your friends!
Be part of the taping of a TNT show at an NBA game!
This isn’t about a celebrity giving away a trinkets for cash, this is a true partnership.  We think it is unprecedented.  Shaq is ready and willing to work for your support and you can bet that he’ll be grateful for every cent and every plug he gets. He loves his fans and to be able to collaborate with them on something like this has him (and us!) really excited.We’re not asking for any more than we need. We are all about appreciation for the fact that you’re putting your hard earned cash on the table so that we can make this a reality and we hold that at the core of this campaign. Shaq and the rest of us at Big Deez want partners who share our passion for excellent games. If you really want to help us make something unforgettable - in the good way this time - then help us go even further and reach our stretch goals.Upon decree of the Big Diesel:  5% of all profits from the game go to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America!Shaq Fu is what the original game should have been – an instant classic.  We're talking Streets of Rage meets Street Fighter meets Devil May Cry. It’s a modern day take on the classic beat ‘em up.  Play as Shaquille O’Neal – learn hundreds of moves and battle techniques, take on thousands of enemies with dozens of cool melee weapons, battle bosses in dynamic arenas, master cool finishing moves and play with your buddies in COOP mode or against each other in player vs player combat.In Shaq Fu, dozens of unique and varied enemies await which require careful use of tactics.  The game also features destructive environments, awesome power ups  and a series of well-designed, beautiful levels with interesting progression.  This is all tied together by what very well might be the story of the century, a performance worthy of an Oscar, by the Big Diesel, in his battle against a villain for the ages – the mysterious Black Star Ninja.
Play as Shaq as he kicks ass and takes no prisoners
Intricately designed combo system that leaves room for a variety of fighting tactics.  Learn the moves and let Shaq rip against his enemies
Pimp your character with new moves and abilities.  Select from different fighting styles or combine styles and create your own new discipline (Shaq FU is what you make it)
Challenges for even the best players.
Adaptive AI keeps the game exciting
Battles against hordes of enemies in the tradition of the lost art of the beat ‘em up.  I mean, who could take Shaq one on one?
Take the challenge up to an entirely new level in unforgettable smack downs against awesome bosses.
Once you beat a boss you unlock him and can play as him in the game.
Fight through the slums of Asian cities, on the rooftops of skyscrapers. Battle it out inside buildings, seedy night clubs, and cause mayhem in the markets.
Smash an enemy through the floor and leap down to a lower level.  Barge through walls and forge your own path.  Smash furniture, toss enemies through windows, even collapse structures – when you are the Shaqbreaker everything is possible
A wide variety of melee and projectile weapons as well as various everyday objects that can be used as weapons – katanas, shurikens, baseball bats, the occasional basketball filled with the wrong type of gas, bottles, knives and dozens more.  Don’t see a weapon you like?  What about that manhole cover or that car door?  You are Shaq after all, so maybe you want to hurl that motorcycle on a bunch of enemies at once.  The world is your projectile.
Wipe out huge numbers of enemies at once.  Bowl down enemies with balls of steel, create earthquakes of unprecedented power, slam dunk baddies with ease.
Modifiers that change your appearance and enhance your skills.  Transform into the monstrous Big Daddy O and crush your enemies.  Twirl into the Big Baryshnikov and pirouette your enemies like a tornado tearing through Kansas.  Power up into the Big Diesel and steamroll your enemies into Kobe-Patties.  A power-up for every nickname Shaq has ever had, and a few new ones for good measure.
Co-op Gameplay.  Grab a friend and battle it out in tandem.  Play as Shaq’s identical twin (no he doesn’t sell insurance) or select from a host of other playable characters with different skills and power-ups. Split screen action available, baby!
Co-op’s not your bag?  Build up your character and fighting style and duke it out online or on the same machine against another player.
Once you have played through the main game revisit it to discover secret environments that you might have missed.
Think its over once the Black Star Ninja, is unmasked?  Think again.  Hosts of challenges await that pit you against the best Shaq Fu’s in the world.

<h3>Our Plan  </h3>
<p>After researching attempts by other groups to do similar projects, we realized that many of them over-promised and under-delivered in key areas like customer service, support, and staying on schedule. We decided early in the process that we were going to wait until we had something concrete to show before launching a crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>Our custom ROM is currently in the final stages of the 'beta' testing phase. The PWNAGE Plaza™ MarketPlace and Community will launch in February 2014 with the first shipment of our PWNAGE Li™ Gaming Tablets. We have the platform developed, the next step is securing hosting for our worldwide network of servers necessary to bring it all together.</p>
<p>We already have a contract in place with our manufacturer, and our first small run of PWNAGE Li™ devices will go into production on September 25, 2013. As soon as we acquire the funds from a successful Indiegogo campaign, we can begin our large-scale production. We anticipate shipping the PWNAGE Li™ to our backers by February of 2014, but higher level backers will have earlier access to the device.</p>
<p>We plan to retail the PWNAGE Li™ on web based virtual stores like Amazon.com, in addition to brick and mortar stores. We are also currently finalizing a deal with a logistics management firm to ensure prompt and effective distribution of our product through a streamlined and efficient supply-chain.</p>
<p>We have the plan in place, we just need to put some gas in the tank! Your support through this Indiegogo campaign will give us the capital we need to complete these important tasks. We are building an amazing team of IT professionals, operations specialists, network administrators, community liaisons, and translators in order to ensure that the PWNAGE Li™ and PWNAGE Plaza™ MarketPlace Community deliver an exceptional user experience.  If you are interested in becoming part of our team, please visit our <a href=""http://pwnageproject.org/join-the-pwnage-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Join the PWNAGE Project</a> page to apply, and thanks for your support!</p>
<p><b>***IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> We're using flexible funding for this campaign because we <b>WILL </b>be manufacturing and delivering the PWNAGE Li™ to our backers by February 2014, regardless of whether we make the goal or not. This project is going forward, no matter what! By supporting our campaign at the $200 EARLY BIRD PACKAGE level, you will receive a PWNAGE Li™ gaming tablet one full month before the general public will have access to this device, and for $50 off MSRP.  We are doing this to help raise capital for infrastructure upgrades and additional staff hiring, and as an effort to give hardcore gamers, hackers, and developers the first chance to test out our new system.</p></span></span><p></p>
<h1>Why Do We Need a New Platform? </h1>
<p>The gaming industry is in a state of complacency. </p>
<p>It's
 not that the big companies don’t have the resources to create new 
advances. It's that they make more money selling you the same system and
 games, just repackaged with minor improvements and maybe a little more 
power, over and over again. Basically they think it just doesn’t pay to 
be innovative and on the cutting edge. <i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </i></p>
<p>The major players in gaming have made it next to impossible for 
newcomers to create games.
The major console and, even to some degree, PC gaming publishers have 
made it extremely difficult for the person in his or her living room to 
publish games. Years ago<b> anyone</b> could create a great game and 
publish it. But now they’re at the top and want to stay there. They do 
this by making SDKs and development kits unreachable for the average new
 developer, and then lock off their systems as Closed Source. You don’t 
like their interface? Well too bad, you're stuck with it. If you change 
it, you void your warranty.</p>
<p>What makes us different from the competition? <b>A LOT!
</b>We’re here to show the gaming industry and the world that you don’t 
have to be a massive or established company to create awesome games, or 
the consoles to play them. </p>
<h1>Freedom &amp; Choice </h1>
<p>We 
believe that consumers should be free to choose not only the products 
they use, but how those products work. What works for one person may not
 be the answer for another. Customization is an absolute necessity to 
provide the best possible experience for everyone. Android has taken 
over most of the phone, tablet, and now, even video game markets because
 it has pre-built solutions that work for many, but also allows 
consumers to completely customize it according to their needs. <br/></p>

<h3>
<b>All PWNAGE Li</b><b>™</b><b> Game Systems Come Rooted, With an Unlocked Bootloader</b>
</h3>
<p>For The PWNAGE Project™, it’s all about choice. We all know how 
annoying it is to be stuck with preloaded programs you'll never use, or 
you want to change to a new ROM but are 
afraid of voiding your warranty or “bricking” your device. Or maybe you 
just like to experiment. We understand, because so do we! And now with 
the PWNAGE Li™ Game System, you can feel free to experiment away! And if
 you
 do “brick” your device, we have a free system restore tool, just in 
case.</p>
<h3><b>Pre-installed Software</b></h3>
<p>It couldn’t be more simple: If you don’t want it, remove it!  The 
PWNAGE Li™ will ship free of bloatware that you can't uninstall, 
running in the background and eating up your device’s valuable systems 
resources.   This is <b>YOUR</b> tablet, you control the software!</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Pure Unadulterated Android</h2>
<p>We hate the thought of having to reinvent the wheel. That’s why we’re giving the community something that is truly awesome; Android OS. No weird little interfaces that are going to limit what you can do in your own system. Just an already great OS, that’s been optimized for gaming, and has everything you need to get the Full PWNAGE Project™ experience. Oh… and just in case you haven't heard, The Official PWNAGE Project™ ROM is being made in cooperation with <a href=""http://freaktab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FreakTab.com</a>! </p>
<p></p>
<h1>The World As We See It… </h1>
<p>We
 are supporters of all things Open Source. More heads are simply better 
than one. We know it, and the Open Source community knows it too. That’s
 what makes us different. Our platform is just that, a platform. 
Hardware and infrastructure. A medium to create on, and a way to get 
your product to the masses. </p>
<p><i><b>The PWNAGE Project</b></i><b>™</b><i><b> is more than just a platform, its a whole new way of doing business…</b></i></p>
<h1>The Goal of the PWNAGE Project™
</h1>
<p>Our goal is to take this ideology, and transform it into 
reality. To give everyone the ability to create, modify, and use our 
system the way they want. To bring back the days when anyone can create 
anywhere. To put the home user developing at his or her kitchen table, 
and the massive multi-national company on the same footing. To create 
new ideas and products that are truly innovative. And, to give consumers
 the freedom of choice…</p>

download free and paid games, apps, mods, etc. But it's more than just a
 simple Market, it's also a Community site as well. Here are some of the
 great features you’ll see:</p>

<b> Who We Are, How We Got Here, and Why We Are Asking for Your Support</b>
</h1>
<p>My name is Matt Leandro, and I am the founder of the PWNAGE 
Project™. When I started this project earlier this year, I honestly had 
no idea that it would have grown so quickly. I have been a gamer my 
whole life, and recently I became frustrated with what was currently available on the market. Thinking back on my own (extensive) years of gaming, the more I remembered all the things that I would change if I
 had the power to do so.  I decided to create The PWNAGE Project™ to 
finally do things right, and deliver the best possible experience for 
gamers. I wanted to make a system that was Open Source, so that it was always improving.  I understand the power of the crowd, and how collaboration with likeminded people can lead to amazing advances in technology and software.</p>
<p>During my 
research, I met Open Source developer Piotr Damek. I discussed my idea 
with him, and we went on to talk about all the other problems with 
proprietary software and hardware, and what we could do to give the user
 a better experience. The worst are the proprietary software licenses 
and that the warrantees are voided if you change or modify the software.
 After this first conversation, we decided to team up to create the 
first Tablet PC and Gaming Device that comes rooted, with an unlocked 
bootloader, and that has a license and warranty that allows <b>you</b> to actually own your device. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If we're gonna make a device then we need a ROM, right? The first 
thing hackers (advanced users) do when getting a new device is to root 
it, and most install a new, custom ROM. From my own experience in 
rooting and installing custom ROMs on my devices, I already knew that <a href=""http://FreakTab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FreakTab.com</a>'s team of developers was the best place to go, and offers the best community support! So I approached them and <a href=""http://FreakTabs.com%27s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FreakTabs.com's</a>
 co-founder Ray 'neomode' Trunk responded. He agreed to develop our 
""Official ROM"" and was so impressed by the idea that he officially 
joined our team a week later.  Ray is a core member of our team, and 
will be continually upgrading our ROM to make sure you have the best 
experience possible.</p>
<p>Now, we are on our way! We have a 
fully-functional production unit and a global team of professionals 
building our system and the support solutions to go with it.</p>
<p>I
 want to make sure that when people learn about us they don't miss the 
main point of what we're all about. Yes, the PWNAGE Li™ model has a lot 
of new features and great concepts behind it, but the main point is 
freedom. Freedom to actually OWN your device, and to use it the way <b>you</b> want! Please join our project as a backer, and become part of the Free and Open Source revolution!</p>

We plan to retail the PWNAGE Li™ on web based virtual stores like Amazon.com, in addition to brick and mortar stores. We are also currently finalizing a deal with a logistics management firm to ensure prompt and effective distribution of our product through a streamlined and efficient supply-chain.
We have the plan in place, we just need to put some gas in the tank! Your support through this Indiegogo campaign will give us the capital we need to complete these important tasks. We are building an amazing team of IT professionals, operations specialists, network administrators, community liaisons, and translators in order to ensure that the PWNAGE Li™ and PWNAGE Plaza™ MarketPlace Community deliver an exceptional user experience.  If you are interested in becoming part of our team, please visit our Join the PWNAGE Project page to apply, and thanks for your support!
***IMPORTANT NOTE: We're using flexible funding for this campaign because we WILL be manufacturing and delivering the PWNAGE Li™ to our backers by February 2014, regardless of whether we make the goal or not. This project is going forward, no matter what! By supporting our campaign at the $200 EARLY BIRD PACKAGE level, you will receive a PWNAGE Li™ gaming tablet one full month before the general public will have access to this device, and for $50 off MSRP.  We are doing this to help raise capital for infrastructure upgrades and additional staff hiring, and as an effort to give hardcore gamers, hackers, and developers the first chance to test out our new system.
Why Do We Need a New Platform? 
The gaming industry is in a state of complacency. 
It's
 not that the big companies don’t have the resources to create new 
advances. It's that they make more money selling you the same system and
 games, just repackaged with minor improvements and maybe a little more 
power, over and over again. Basically they think it just doesn’t pay to 
be innovative and on the cutting edge.  
The major players in gaming have made it next to impossible for 
newcomers to create games.
The major console and, even to some degree, PC gaming publishers have 
made it extremely difficult for the person in his or her living room to 
publish games. Years ago anyone could create a great game and 
publish it. But now they’re at the top and want to stay there. They do 
this by making SDKs and development kits unreachable for the average new
 developer, and then lock off their systems as Closed Source. You don’t 
like their interface? Well too bad, you're stuck with it. If you change 
it, you void your warranty.
What makes us different from the competition? A LOT!
We’re here to show the gaming industry and the world that you don’t 
have to be a massive or established company to create awesome games, or 
the consoles to play them. 
Freedom & Choice 
We 
believe that consumers should be free to choose not only the products 
they use, but how those products work. What works for one person may not
 be the answer for another. Customization is an absolute necessity to 
provide the best possible experience for everyone. Android has taken 
over most of the phone, tablet, and now, even video game markets because
 it has pre-built solutions that work for many, but also allows 
consumers to completely customize it according to their needs. 



All PWNAGE Li™ Game Systems Come Rooted, With an Unlocked Bootloader

For The PWNAGE Project™, it’s all about choice. We all know how 
annoying it is to be stuck with preloaded programs you'll never use, or 
you want to change to a new ROM but are 
afraid of voiding your warranty or “bricking” your device. Or maybe you 
just like to experiment. We understand, because so do we! And now with 
the PWNAGE Li™ Game System, you can feel free to experiment away! And if
 you
 do “brick” your device, we have a free system restore tool, just in 
case.
Pre-installed Software
It couldn’t be more simple: If you don’t want it, remove it!  The 
PWNAGE Li™ will ship free of bloatware that you can't uninstall, 
running in the background and eating up your device’s valuable systems 
resources.   This is YOUR tablet, you control the software!

Pure Unadulterated Android
We hate the thought of having to reinvent the wheel. That’s why we’re giving the community something that is truly awesome; Android OS. No weird little interfaces that are going to limit what you can do in your own system. Just an already great OS, that’s been optimized for gaming, and has everything you need to get the Full PWNAGE Project™ experience. Oh… and just in case you haven't heard, The Official PWNAGE Project™ ROM is being made in cooperation with FreakTab.com! 

The World As We See It… 
We
 are supporters of all things Open Source. More heads are simply better 
than one. We know it, and the Open Source community knows it too. That’s
 what makes us different. Our platform is just that, a platform. 
Hardware and infrastructure. A medium to create on, and a way to get 
your product to the masses. 
The PWNAGE Project™ is more than just a platform, its a whole new way of doing business…
The Goal of the PWNAGE Project™

Our goal is to take this ideology, and transform it into 
reality. To give everyone the ability to create, modify, and use our 
system the way they want. To bring back the days when anyone can create 
anywhere. To put the home user developing at his or her kitchen table, 
and the massive multi-national company on the same footing. To create 
new ideas and products that are truly innovative. And, to give consumers
 the freedom of choice…



The PWNAGE Li™ will also feature The PWNAGE Plaza™ MarketPlace Community, a one-stop-shop to 
download free and paid games, apps, mods, etc. But it's more than just a
 simple Market, it's also a Community site as well. Here are some of the
 great features you’ll see:



We’re building an immersive online 
community experience and have separate profiles, mini-sites, and stores 
for Members, Groups (clans, clubs, guilds for gamers, etc.), and 
Developers.


Members have their own profiles, wall, cloud 
storage, friends, and internal email, along with a ton of other cool 
features that we will be unveiling soon.


Groups also have their own profile/mini-site, with forums, group chat, group storage, and a whole lot more.


Developers
 have all the same access as the Members and Groups, and in addition 
have a mini-store built into their page that is linked directly to the 
main Market. 



All Members, Groups, and Developers have the following features as well:
 



Built in petition and voting systems. Petitions can be put on 
Group or Developer pages, the main site, or a combination of sites. 

Communication system that includes chat, VoIP, and video.
And that’s just what we can tell you so far!





The PWNAGE Project™ Is About So Much More Than Just Games!

Gaming is in our blood, and is part of the PWNAGE Project™ core 
credo. But it's not the only thing you can do with the PWNAGE Li™. 
Please remember that first and foremost this is a fully functioning 
Tablet PC, not just a simple gaming device. Also keep in mind that the 
PWNAGE Plaza™ MarketPlace Community isn’t just about gaming either. Any 
program or app you can run on other Android devices can run on the 
PWNAGE Li™.
The PWNAGE Li™ is built on Android OS so that anyone 
from hobbyists to developers, and from one-person operations to 
multinational companies can participate.
With our system, you're not just limited to creating games, you can 
create anything! Apps, Mods, ROMs, and anything else you can dream up.
So come join the The PWNAGE Project™, and join the Open Source 
Revolution!




 Who We Are, How We Got Here, and Why We Are Asking for Your Support

My name is Matt Leandro, and I am the founder of the PWNAGE 
Project™. When I started this project earlier this year, I honestly had 
no idea that it would have grown so quickly. I have been a gamer my 
whole life, and recently I became frustrated with what was currently available on the market. Thinking back on my own (extensive) years of gaming, the more I remembered all the things that I would change if I
 had the power to do so.  I decided to create The PWNAGE Project™ to 
finally do things right, and deliver the best possible experience for 
gamers. I wanted to make a system that was Open Source, so that it was always improving.  I understand the power of the crowd, and how collaboration with likeminded people can lead to amazing advances in technology and software.
During my 
research, I met Open Source developer Piotr Damek. I discussed my idea 
with him, and we went on to talk about all the other problems with 
proprietary software and hardware, and what we could do to give the user
 a better experience. The worst are the proprietary software licenses 
and that the warrantees are voided if you change or modify the software.
 After this first conversation, we decided to team up to create the 
first Tablet PC and Gaming Device that comes rooted, with an unlocked 
bootloader, and that has a license and warranty that allows you to actually own your device. 



If we're gonna make a device then we need a ROM, right? The first 
thing hackers (advanced users) do when getting a new device is to root 
it, and most install a new, custom ROM. From my own experience in 
rooting and installing custom ROMs on my devices, I already knew that FreakTab.com's team of developers was the best place to go, and offers the best community support! So I approached them and FreakTabs.com's
 co-founder Ray 'neomode' Trunk responded. He agreed to develop our 
""Official ROM"" and was so impressed by the idea that he officially 
joined our team a week later.  Ray is a core member of our team, and 
will be continually upgrading our ROM to make sure you have the best 
experience possible.
Now, we are on our way! We have a 
fully-functional production unit and a global team of professionals 
building our system and the support solutions to go with it.
I
 want to make sure that when people learn about us they don't miss the 
main point of what we're all about. Yes, the PWNAGE Li™ model has a lot 
of new features and great concepts behind it, but the main point is 
freedom. Freedom to actually OWN your device, and to use it the way you want! Please join our project as a backer, and become part of the Free and Open Source revolution!
Matt Leandro - PWNAGE Project™ Founder

<p></p>
<p>Ever since Sam's dream of becoming an NBA player and Zacc's dream of becoming an NFL player fell short due to injuries, we spend most of our time playing video games and downloading addictive apps to play even more video games!</p>
<p>As some of you may know Mambo is the main character to our game that consists of wild monkeys and ton of angry gorillas. Mambo is a game about how one little monkey named ""Mambo"" battles a ton of angry gorillas to take back control of his jungle. He goes throughout each level and fights these gorillas with no fear all by himself because he is totally awesome!! </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/12314/files/20130814142730-about_mambo.jpg?1376515650"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>We Are Making The Most Coolest Game (With Your Help)!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once upon a time in Sweetgum Jungle, a bunch of wild monkeys lived very peacefully. Until one day, a troop of angry gorillas invaded the jungle. These angry gorillas kicked all of the monkeys out of the jungle, stole all of their precious jewels, and most importantly, they ate all of the monkeys bananas. OH NO!!!!! THEY ATE ALL OF THE MONKEYS BANANAS!!!!! After kicking all of the monkeys out of the jungle, there was one brave little monkey who refused to be pushed around any longer and was determined to take back control of the Sweetgum Jungle. That one brave little monkey marched his butt right back to Sweetgum Jungle and he plans to not only battle the angry gorillas, but defeat them as well. By doing so, he must go throughout a ton of levels and defeat the angry gorillas in every level to take back control of the jungle! This is the story of the chosen one. The one that they call ""Mambo"". <br/></p>
<p>This game features fun and challenging game mechanics, as well as cut-scenes animated in the style of Mambo. Mambo even has his own special theme song! That instantly makes him the most awesome and coolest monkey ever!!!! </p>

<p>We have a few games we would like to make in the Mambo series, we're starting with a game that we feel is both fun and can be produced and launched relatively quickly. If we can raise the money, this game should only take about 4 months of dedicated development to get into everyone's hands! <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If Mambo does well, we will immediately begin to work on a few other really exciting game ideas and follow ups to the series. The goal is to always have a game in development FOREVER, so there's always something new and awesome to look forward to! </p>
<p>We have always wanted to make a game. A game that will not just be a ""simple game"" but a game that will grow into the next household game! We love the animated show, and if we could partner with a real game studio to make a game around Mambo, I believe we could make something that's both fun and funny!</p>
<p><b>We get bored really easily, so trust us, this game is gonna have to be AWESOME!</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/12369/files/20130814145422-help-1.jpg?1376517262"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<b></b><p><b> </b></p>
<p>It takes more than just an idea to create something as epic as a Mambo video game! There are the game developers, graphic artists, animators, voice over talent, editors....and that's just to name a few.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>We Need Your Help!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every penny donated (after covering the awesome donation perks, etc) will go toward the production of this, and FUTURE games. Game production will begin as soon as funds start coming in. If we're able to surpass our goal, we can start production on the next game and more Mambo episodes!</p>

<p>In addition, we are also donating a percentage of our profits (If Funded) from Mambo to St. Jude. Like Mambo, St. Jude kids are also battling a battle, a much bigger battle cancer. We believe we can not only create the next big game, but also save lives while doing so!   </p>

<h3><br/></h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hi, we are Sam Mattox, Zacc Wells and Carlton Cotten!

Ever since Sam's dream of becoming an NBA player and Zacc's dream of becoming an NFL player fell short due to injuries, we spend most of our time playing video games and downloading addictive apps to play even more video games!
As some of you may know Mambo is the main character to our game that consists of wild monkeys and ton of angry gorillas. Mambo is a game about how one little monkey named ""Mambo"" battles a ton of angry gorillas to take back control of his jungle. He goes throughout each level and fights these gorillas with no fear all by himself because he is totally awesome!! 


We Are Making The Most Coolest Game (With Your Help)!

Once upon a time in Sweetgum Jungle, a bunch of wild monkeys lived very peacefully. Until one day, a troop of angry gorillas invaded the jungle. These angry gorillas kicked all of the monkeys out of the jungle, stole all of their precious jewels, and most importantly, they ate all of the monkeys bananas. OH NO!!!!! THEY ATE ALL OF THE MONKEYS BANANAS!!!!! After kicking all of the monkeys out of the jungle, there was one brave little monkey who refused to be pushed around any longer and was determined to take back control of the Sweetgum Jungle. That one brave little monkey marched his butt right back to Sweetgum Jungle and he plans to not only battle the angry gorillas, but defeat them as well. By doing so, he must go throughout a ton of levels and defeat the angry gorillas in every level to take back control of the jungle! This is the story of the chosen one. The one that they call ""Mambo"". 
This game features fun and challenging game mechanics, as well as cut-scenes animated in the style of Mambo. Mambo even has his own special theme song! That instantly makes him the most awesome and coolest monkey ever!!!! 
 

 












We have a few games we would like to make in the Mambo series, we're starting with a game that we feel is both fun and can be produced and launched relatively quickly. If we can raise the money, this game should only take about 4 months of dedicated development to get into everyone's hands! 






If Mambo does well, we will immediately begin to work on a few other really exciting game ideas and follow ups to the series. The goal is to always have a game in development FOREVER, so there's always something new and awesome to look forward to! 
We have always wanted to make a game. A game that will not just be a ""simple game"" but a game that will grow into the next household game! We love the animated show, and if we could partner with a real game studio to make a game around Mambo, I believe we could make something that's both fun and funny!
We get bored really easily, so trust us, this game is gonna have to be AWESOME!



 
It takes more than just an idea to create something as epic as a Mambo video game! There are the game developers, graphic artists, animators, voice over talent, editors....and that's just to name a few.

We Need Your Help!

Every penny donated (after covering the awesome donation perks, etc) will go toward the production of this, and FUTURE games. Game production will begin as soon as funds start coming in. If we're able to surpass our goal, we can start production on the next game and more Mambo episodes!
Wanna Help??
WOW!! OH BOY, YOU ARE AMAZING!
Every pledge will help make this vision become a reality. Contribute today and receive the EXCLUSIVE REWARDS available ONLY to those pledging through this IndieGogo campaign. 

In addition, we are also donating a percentage of our profits (If Funded) from Mambo to St. Jude. Like Mambo, St. Jude kids are also battling a battle, a much bigger battle cancer. We believe we can not only create the next big game, but also save lives while doing so!   


































The best part about making a contribution (other than being part of a movement that completely changes everything we've ever known about gaming forever because it has a theme song and a monkey slaying angry gorillas. Some of that might be an embellishment) are the rewards of course! All of our give backs are EXCLUSIVE to this IndieGogo campaign.

<h2>I was 19 and as savvy as a brick</h2>
<p>I invented The 4th Horse when I was 19 because I was bored and I would do anything to avoid studying for my exams.  In those days the internet wasn't even a thought in someones head and I was about as business savvy as a brick; so I did what most 19 year olds would do with a good idea.  I stuck the rules in a drawer and decided to do something with them later.</p>
<h2>A little While Later</h2>
<p>Well some 28 years later when I was cleaning out my garage I found those rules in a box and I remember thinking its funny how they have traveled around with me for so long and they surface now.  Now that we have the internet and super fast computers.</p>
<p>I decided this must be a good omen, I remember thinking because we have all this technology now I have to take The 4th Horse from an idea in my head and go totally global with it.  <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">With that in mind I revamped the rules, I made them edgy,  aggressive, with a medieval look and feel.  I found an IT company to help build the site </span><i style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">(Medma Infomatix.  they're great</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">), programs and apps the graphic design and all the rest.</span></p>
<h2>The 4th Horse is Where Poker, Meets Chess in a Cage Fight.</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/8818/files/20130813005621-Where_Poker_Meets_Chess_in_a_Cage_Fight.jpg?1376380581"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The 4th Horse is based around the idea of four Royal families going to war each trying to dominate or destroy the other as they fight for supremacy. As I said the best way to describe The 4th Horse is it is a game where the tension of poker meets the strategy of chess in an aggressive no holds bared cage fight battle for supremacy.</p>
<p>To win you have to be strategic and aggressive or very, very, subtle, because if you aren't you will get smashed. You have to be smart, focused and determined or you don't have a chance.  You have to be clever because brute force isn't enough. It's a game where only the hardest, toughest and smartest win.  </p>
<p>Your job is to battle to capture a Royal House, or knock your opponents out of the game. You can assassinate a whole House, force your opponents to give up there hard won gains and a hole lot more.  You have to do this all while they are trying to do the same to you. If you don't follow the action you're dead. </p>
<p>If all this isn't enough action for you their is also the Devastation Play, the Siege Play and the the Sudden Death rule.  In The 4th Horse you aren't safe and the tension never stops until you are the only player left.  There are no draws only winners and what ever is left of everyone else at the end.  Harsh I know, but heaps of fun.</p>
<h2><strong>Why am I doing this? </strong></h2>
<p>In that moment when I found those rules in a box in my garage I said to myself this is an opportunity to take an idea I had all those years ago and bring it to the world.  </p>
<p>As ridiculous as it may sound, I made a commitment to myself that I am not allowed to give up until I make the 4th horse go global.  Besides I want to prove that a little bloke can succeed if he is persistent, thoughtful enough and gathers the right team and also asks for a bunch of help from a whole bunch or really nice people. </p>
<p>I hope you can help or I am going to have to live for a very long time if I try to pay for all of this on my own.  Besides it's no fun doing the whole global phenomenon thing all on your own.</p>
<h2><strong>I totally believe in The 4th Horse and so do others, The Beta Testing Event</strong></h2>
<p>The 4th Horse is an awesome game. In November 2012 I ran a beta testing event.  At that event which was held in Sydney Australia I showed a bunch people how to play, I demonstrated the website and then we let people play.  At the end of the night I collected feedback which we have used to improve The 4th Horse experience.  The feedback I received was unanimous and positive. The 4th Horse is a fantastic game with broad appeal to a wide range of players. It has the potential to be a ""World Game"".</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">We're Nearly There But we Need Your Help to Finish</strong></p>
<p>So far I've funded the development of everything from the website, the programs, the mobile platforms, the cards the graphics, the legals all out of my own pocket. I've gone as far as I can on a seriously tight budget. That's where you guys come in I hope.   I'd like to ask for your help to get the 4th Horse completed ready to launch hopefully early in 2014 assuming I can get everything done in time.</p>
<p>So if you would like to get on board please have a look at the perks to the right of this page and choose which ever one / ones you would like.  As soon as I can I will get it to you asap.</p>

<p>I have to complete the business builders system in which members can build their own 4th Horse businesses using our technology.  Think of this as building your own group within The 4th Horse framework and we will pay you generously to do so.  I completely believe in sharing the success of a business with the members.  This is one example of how I intend to do that. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">The mobile apps for iPhone and Android have to be completed.  This includes the 2, 3 and 4 player versions. At present we are half way through completing the free version in which you put yourself against the computer.  You could try to beat it now.</span></p>
<p>We also need to hire animators, a marketing manager, and an assistant , complete my marketing plan and then role out the marketing plan. I am hoping to get enough from this campaign to pay for staff and a dedicated marketing person for 12 months.  We have a lot in store for the first 12 months, so if you could help make this campaign as successful as possible me and my team would be eternally grateful. </p>
<p>I have to pay for merchandise and marketing materials, events, advertising, prizes, legals, and a lot more.  <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">I need to pay for the Indiegogo campaign.  This will of course depend on how much will be raised.  </span></p>
<p>Once that is all complete we need to then take it to the world by organizing real world live events where people get to play and experience the the 4th Horse. </p>
<p>Once we get enough members we then have to organize the worlds first 4th Horse World Championship Tournament. Hopefully by the end of 2014 we will be running the first ever 4th Horse Grand Master tournament.  In early 2015 we intend to crown the worlds first ever World Champion.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">I estimate that in order to get The 4th Horse ready for launch this will all cost a minimum of $28000.00.  But enough of my prattle.  Have a look at the perks to the right of this page and choose any you like and I will get them to you asap. They are packed full of exclusive stuff.  </span></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to have a look at my campaign.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>

The Vision, A total experience







My vision for the 4th Horse goes beyond just creating an amazing game. I want to give my members a total experience on a global scale. Have no doubts The 4th Horse already is a seriously compelling, aggressive, strategy game that tests you from the moment you start playing. We intend to make the 4th Horse a global game, with online and live tournaments around the world and much more.
The 4th Horse Picture Cards


The 4th Horse Number Cards


Intense fun and connecting with players around the world.



The 4th Horse total experience is about connecting people from all around the world online and or face to face through The 4th Horse Live Global tournaments. Players will be able to have huge amounts of fun holding challenge matches or participating in local and global tournaments both live and online.  The 4th Horse experience will be entertaining to watch as much as it is to play.  The 4th Horse Experience is also about finding those very special and talented people who could rise to the top and become 4th Horse Legends and a whole bunch more.  What about you do you think you have got what it takes to become a Legend of The Game!
Become the first ever 4th Horse World Champion


Once were set up we will quickly begin searching for the first Grand Masters and ultimately the First World Champion.  Imagine your name being placed in The 4th Horse Hall of Fame as first ever Grand Master or international Grand Master or the worlds first ever World Champion.  It is going to be someone it might as well be you.
The total 4th Horse experience will also include everything a player needs,  to learn how to become a Master Player.  They will be able to enter tournaments all around the world and to become a Master Player or an International Grand Master.  The 4th Horse Total Experience includes experienced players coaching new players, forums, social experiences and simple visual entertainment.  They will even be able to charge for their coaching if they want to.

Business Builders and Affiliate Memberships



I want members to benefit from being a part of the 4th Horse community by playing and/or by building their own businesses using The 4th Horse Business Builder memberships. I want to do this without the gambling associated with other card games.
I also want local members to be able to run their own live tournaments under our licence in which they will be able to keep the lions share of the profits.  This could be very lucrative for any hard working person.
Me and my team know how to do this and I completely believe that when it is done The 4th Horse will be a global game up there with all the great games of all time.  But we need your help.
We'd really appreciate the support and want to thank you in advance 
We need help to raise the money to finish the development of the technology and to hire staff to fund the marketing campaign to pay the legals and so much more.  I also need your input to make The 4th Horse total experience as good as it can be.  For now however I am only asking for enough funds to finish the development of the technology and some basic admin and marketing. 
Thank you perks you can use straight away.



If you would like to help me raise funds I would greatly appreciated and I thank you in advance.
To raise the funds I have put together a whole bunch of super cool, exclusive, great value perks at super discounted prices. Because me and my team have completed a lot of the work already many of the perks are available right away. Which means that when you contribute to this campaign not only will you be getting them at massive discounts you can access a lot of them now.  No waiting to start playing. Some of the perks are still in development but we will get them to you asap.  Some of the perks you will have to wait a short time for.

The Back Story or the Perks



If you want to know about the background behind the 4th Horse have a look at the story below.
Or if you would like to just go straight to the perks and see what you can get, just have a look at the perks listed on the right hand side of this page.  For more details, scroll down to where it says The Perks to see what's on offer. on the bottom of this page.
I was 19 and as savvy as a brick
I invented The 4th Horse when I was 19 because I was bored and I would do anything to avoid studying for my exams.  In those days the internet wasn't even a thought in someones head and I was about as business savvy as a brick; so I did what most 19 year olds would do with a good idea.  I stuck the rules in a drawer and decided to do something with them later.
A little While Later
Well some 28 years later when I was cleaning out my garage I found those rules in a box and I remember thinking its funny how they have traveled around with me for so long and they surface now.  Now that we have the internet and super fast computers.
I decided this must be a good omen, I remember thinking because we have all this technology now I have to take The 4th Horse from an idea in my head and go totally global with it.  With that in mind I revamped the rules, I made them edgy,  aggressive, with a medieval look and feel.  I found an IT company to help build the site (Medma Infomatix.  they're great), programs and apps the graphic design and all the rest.
The 4th Horse is Where Poker, Meets Chess in a Cage Fight.







The 4th Horse is based around the idea of four Royal families going to war each trying to dominate or destroy the other as they fight for supremacy. As I said the best way to describe The 4th Horse is it is a game where the tension of poker meets the strategy of chess in an aggressive no holds bared cage fight battle for supremacy.
To win you have to be strategic and aggressive or very, very, subtle, because if you aren't you will get smashed. You have to be smart, focused and determined or you don't have a chance.  You have to be clever because brute force isn't enough. It's a game where only the hardest, toughest and smartest win.  
Your job is to battle to capture a Royal House, or knock your opponents out of the game. You can assassinate a whole House, force your opponents to give up there hard won gains and a hole lot more.  You have to do this all while they are trying to do the same to you. If you don't follow the action you're dead. 
If all this isn't enough action for you their is also the Devastation Play, the Siege Play and the the Sudden Death rule.  In The 4th Horse you aren't safe and the tension never stops until you are the only player left.  There are no draws only winners and what ever is left of everyone else at the end.  Harsh I know, but heaps of fun.
Why am I doing this? 
In that moment when I found those rules in a box in my garage I said to myself this is an opportunity to take an idea I had all those years ago and bring it to the world.  
As ridiculous as it may sound, I made a commitment to myself that I am not allowed to give up until I make the 4th horse go global.  Besides I want to prove that a little bloke can succeed if he is persistent, thoughtful enough and gathers the right team and also asks for a bunch of help from a whole bunch or really nice people. 
I hope you can help or I am going to have to live for a very long time if I try to pay for all of this on my own.  Besides it's no fun doing the whole global phenomenon thing all on your own.
I totally believe in The 4th Horse and so do others, The Beta Testing Event
The 4th Horse is an awesome game. In November 2012 I ran a beta testing event.  At that event which was held in Sydney Australia I showed a bunch people how to play, I demonstrated the website and then we let people play.  At the end of the night I collected feedback which we have used to improve The 4th Horse experience.  The feedback I received was unanimous and positive. The 4th Horse is a fantastic game with broad appeal to a wide range of players. It has the potential to be a ""World Game"".
We're Nearly There But we Need Your Help to Finish
So far I've funded the development of everything from the website, the programs, the mobile platforms, the cards the graphics, the legals all out of my own pocket. I've gone as far as I can on a seriously tight budget. That's where you guys come in I hope.   I'd like to ask for your help to get the 4th Horse completed ready to launch hopefully early in 2014 assuming I can get everything done in time.
So if you would like to get on board please have a look at the perks to the right of this page and choose which ever one / ones you would like.  As soon as I can I will get it to you asap.
Here's what I have to get done before Launch



Me and my team have completed almost all of the website the game program, the facebook site and back end Content Management System.  We are currently doing the user testing.  The basic system is already really good.  It just needs tweaking.

Site Update and Mobile App Development Costs : ($19000)
We will need a bunch of people to join and start running the site and game through their paces, and sending in feedback so we can make them the best experience possible. That's why everyone who joins the campaign gets a diamond membership.  We want you to start playing now.  When the information comes in we'll make changes based on the feed back.  Please be kind though.  This is the beta version we know we have a lot of development to do before it's perfect.  Having said that I am budgeting 



Website Updates ($1000)


Game Engine Updates for Artificial Intelligence, 3 and 4 player modes ($5000)


How to play, interactive, Learning Program ($4000)

Mobile Platform Development (iOS,Android,WP8) ($9000)



Merchandise: ($1000)
The physical cards and the rule books are almost complete.  We need to organize the final artwork and we need to organize suppliers, and then pay for merchandise and set up the distribution system.

Stock on hand ($1000)


Marketing Materials ($3000)
A business rises and falls on the strength of its marketing.  


Marketing video ($2000)
Merchandise and branding materials ($1000)

Advertising ($1000) up until the Launch
We will need to get the buzz out.  Mostly we will be doing our best to get PR but paid advertising will still need to be done.  Here's what we estimate will be the minimum spend.  

Advertisements (Facebook Ads, Banners) ($500)

Google Advertising ($500)



Running Costs and Support : ($4000) for 12 months



Hosting Servers ($1500 PA)


IT Support ($1500)

Website Help Desk ($1000 P/A)



At the moment the how to play videos on the site are really basic and are really only there as place holders.  They will be replaced with an interactive how to play learning program.
An interactive how to play course needs to be built so people can learn and develop their game.  The three and four player AI system has to be developed. There is a lot of work to be done to complete.
I have to complete the business builders system in which members can build their own 4th Horse businesses using our technology.  Think of this as building your own group within The 4th Horse framework and we will pay you generously to do so.  I completely believe in sharing the success of a business with the members.  This is one example of how I intend to do that. 
The mobile apps for iPhone and Android have to be completed.  This includes the 2, 3 and 4 player versions. At present we are half way through completing the free version in which you put yourself against the computer.  You could try to beat it now.
We also need to hire animators, a marketing manager, and an assistant , complete my marketing plan and then role out the marketing plan. I am hoping to get enough from this campaign to pay for staff and a dedicated marketing person for 12 months.  We have a lot in store for the first 12 months, so if you could help make this campaign as successful as possible me and my team would be eternally grateful. 
I have to pay for merchandise and marketing materials, events, advertising, prizes, legals, and a lot more.  I need to pay for the Indiegogo campaign.  This will of course depend on how much will be raised.  
Once that is all complete we need to then take it to the world by organizing real world live events where people get to play and experience the the 4th Horse. 
Once we get enough members we then have to organize the worlds first 4th Horse World Championship Tournament. Hopefully by the end of 2014 we will be running the first ever 4th Horse Grand Master tournament.  In early 2015 we intend to crown the worlds first ever World Champion.  
I estimate that in order to get The 4th Horse ready for launch this will all cost a minimum of $28000.00.  But enough of my prattle.  Have a look at the perks to the right of this page and choose any you like and I will get them to you asap. They are packed full of exclusive stuff.  
Thanks for taking the time to have a look at my campaign. 
Cheers
Jim

 ""it’s by far the most inviting light gun game for casual and younger gamers that I’ve played in years and the fact you can have up to four players shooting away at once is both a literal and figurative blast.""

<h3>SimAnt Overview</h3>
<p>SimAnt was a popular PC game released by Maxis in 1994. It was one of my personal favorites, and developed a cult following in the gaming world.  </p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">""The game is essentially a simulation of an ant colony. Wright was inspired by E.O. Wilson's study of ant colonies. The game consists of three modes: a Quick Game, a Full Game, and an Experimental Game. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In SimAnt, the player plays the role of an ant in a colony of black ants in the back yard of a suburban home. The ant colony must battle against enemy red ants. The ultimate goal is to spread throughout the garden, into the house, and finally to drive out the red ants and human owners. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In the Quick Game, the player establishes a black ant colony in a small patch of yard, shown in top-down perspective. The computer opponent establishes a competing red ant colony in the same patch. Underground ant colonies are depicted in a side view. The player has direct control of a single ant at a time, indicated by a yellow color, and may switch control to a different ant at any time by either double-clicking the desired ant or choosing Exchange from the Yellow Ant menu and clicking on it. A little known fact is that the spider in the game can also be controlled by using the Exchange method. The player's yellow ant may influence the behavior of other black ants by leaving pheromone trails to destinations such as food and enemy ant colonies and can control the other ants in a limited way (by ordering a certain number to follow it, for instance). The quick game is won or lost when either the red or black colony in said patch is defeated.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The player's yellow ant may pick up food and pebbles, engage in trophallaxis (by receiving regurgitated food from friendly ants), and attack enemy ants. Groups of ants (or yellow ant with his recruits) may attack and kill bigger enemies like spiders, caterpillars, and antlions. Natural hazards include human footsteps, electrical outlets, bugspray, spiders, antlions, lawnmowers, and rain, which washes away pheromone trails and can flood the bottom of ant nests.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In the Full Game, the player begins with an ant colony in an overhead view, much like the Quick Game. The region of this overhead view is a single square of a map containing a yard and house. The player spreads to other areas by producing young queens and drones to mate with each other. The full game is lost when the black colonies are eliminated and won when the red colonies are eliminated and the humans are driven out of the house.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Experimental Game is similar to the Quick Game, except the player can also control red ants, spiders and has access to a set of experimental tools. These tools allow the player to place pheromone trails, maze walls, rocks, ants, pesticides and food.""</p>
<p>Unfortunately the graphics are extremely out-dated and the game itself requires a DOS emulator to run properly.  I wanted to bring SimAnt up to date, with all new sprites and graphics, while keeping the core functionality.</p>
<h3>Current Progress</h3>
<p>I have been working on this rebuild project for the past seven months, and here is what I have so far:   </p>
<ul>
<li>All 2d sprites, backgrounds, and textures re-created. </li>
<li>Animations have been added for walking ants, as well as moving antennae while idle.</li>
<li>Code for Above-Ground Terrain Generation</li>
<li>A.I. Developed for Ants, allowing them to forage, dig, or fight.</li>
<li>Player-controlled underground digging functionality.</li>
<li>Health, food and foraging system developed and functional.</li>
<li>Pheremone-based trail functionality for both food and combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above mentioned items have been compiled into a very basic executable prototype, with limited functionality.  </p>

<h3>My Funding Goal - $2,000</h3>
<p>My funding goal of $2,000 will be used to finalize and launch the game.  I have been financing this project with my personal savings, and with less than a month of work left, my funds are running dry.  I don't want to see all this hard work get shelved and collect dust, so I would greatly appreciate the support of any SimAnt fans.  </p>
<p>A portion of the funds will go towards creating high-quality boxes and game manuals, for those who donate over $50.</p>
<p>Depending upon it's popularity, I may also need to pay for the hosting and bandwidth required for digital distribution. </p>
<p><img alt=""Red Worker Ants"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brainstormjoe.com/ants/redants.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Red Worker Ants""/></p>
<h3>Level 2 Goal - $5,000 - New Playable Race - Termites </h3>
<p>If we manage to raise $5,000 or more, then I will create and add a new playable race - Termites.  They will function like the ants, but their nest will be located within a tree stump or log, with a wooden cross-section, rather than dirt.  Unlike ants, termites will be able to use wood as a food source, and termite soldiers will have an additional short-range spray attack which does damage-over-time.  A campaign against the more powerful termites will be unlocked after defeating the red ants.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Level 3 Goal - $7,500 - Multiplayer Gameplay</h3>
<p>If we manage to raise $7,500, I will incorporate multiplayer functionality, along with a port to iPhone and Android smartphones.  In my opinion, multiplayer game play was the only thing SimAnt was missing.  </p>
<p>I always envisioned two types of multiplayer scenarios:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A quick game session, where players can compete against each other or the computer.  These games would be relatively short and fast-paced. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A campaign session, where players can create and manage multiple colonies.  This game would take much longer and involve more strategy. </p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Benefits for Developers</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine having the freedom to concentrate solely on the development of great MMOs.  As your publisher, Massive Breakthroughs will take care of all the hosting, marketing, and support for your creations.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Focus on what you do best and let Massive Breakthroughs take care of the rest. </p>
<p>Our proprietary Interactive Content Delivery System will be made available free of charge to any developer who selects Massive Breakthroughs as their publisher.  With these development tools, developers can create top-notch games at a fraction of traditional costs and times, without sacrificing quality. </p>
<p>Developers can earn significant royalties month after month.  As long as subscribers play your games, you will continue to get paid.  The more they play, you more you earn.</p>
<p>Developers can create a small portion of their game, and get feedback from consumers prior to investing massive resources into their efforts.  If the game is favorably received, they can start generating revenue immediately while simultaneously developing new levels.  On the other hand, if feedback is unfavorable, they have the ability to make modifications early in the development process. </p>
<p>Cross-platform compatibility enables a developer to create a game once and have it be accessible across many different platforms.  Since they are developing for the Massive Breakthroughs system instead of specific platforms (consoles, PC, and wireless), new platform specifications and release dates are no longer concerns.  As new platforms are introduced, Massive Breakthroughs will create browsers for them. This significantly increases your potential market, without requiring additional work from you.</p>
<p>Massive Breakthroughs’ multi-tracking capability allows developers to edit parts of their games to cater to a specific audience.  Parents can select the appropriate level of graphic detail and language, allowing foul language or intense violence to be replaced with content that is more appropriate for younger players.  Subsequently, developers possess the ability to create a single game that could be played and enjoyed by virtually every member of the family. </p>
<h3><strong>Benefits for Gamers</strong></h3>
<p>No long term commitment required.  Pay month to month.  Stay a subscriber and your subscription price never goes up.   Refer your friends and earn residual commissions.  </p>
<p>For only $25 per month, subscribers will have full access to all of our MMOs.  No hardcopies or expansion packs.  No advertising.  Just great game play!!!</p>
<p>Our gaming website will launch with five games and additional MMOs will be added on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MMO Game Classifications</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First Person Shooter – A MMO centered on gun and ranged weapon-based combat through a first person perspective</li>
<li>Real Time Strategy – A time-based MMO centered on using resources and strategy to build units and defeat an opponent.</li>
<li>Role Playing – A MMO in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.</li>
<li>Simulations – A MMO that attempts to copy various activities in “real life” for the purposes of training, analysis, or prediction.</li>

</ul>
<p>Players can play our MMOs via a PC, smartphone, or tablet.  Games can be transferred back and forth between any of these devices.   So gaming can continue on the go.</p>

</ul>
<p>Play at your convenience. To assist subscribers with any problems or answer any questions, we provide customer service on a 24/7/52 basis.    </p>
<h3><strong>Benefits for Parents</strong></h3>
<p>As parents, Massive Breakthroughs co-founders John Keller and Steven Moher, understand the importance of being able to influence the activities of your children.  Subsequently, extensive parental controls are built into our browsers.  </p>
<p>Each of our MMOs is awarded a rating classification.   A synopsis of each MMO is also provided.  Armed with this knowledge and the parental controls, parents can block inappropriate MMOs from their children.       </p>
<p>Parents may also use the parental controls to determine how often their children can play the MMOs.  They can set a certain number of hours per month, week, or day.  They can set a time range to cover certain hours of the day.  Furthermore, different settings can be established for every member of the family.   </p>
<p>Low cost is another benefit for parents.  For only $25 per month, a subscriber will have access to all our MMOs (excluding the ones blocked by the parents). This is significant, especially if your children are very avid gamers.</p>
<p>Our gaming website will launch with five games and additional MMOs will be added on a quarterly basis. Subscribers can play our MMOs via a PC, smartphone, or tablet.  Games can be transferred back and forth between any of these devices, so gaming can continue on the go.</p>

Massive Breakthroughs is the vision of co-founders John Keller and Steven Moher.  These technology geeks and avid gamers have spent the past decade evaluating the video game industry especially MMOs.  They understand the vast array of problems that impact developers, gamers, and parents. As a result, Massive Breakthroughs will provide cost effective video game development that is profitable and affordable without sacrificing quality. 
Now we need your help.   Why are we asking for such a large amount?  We would prefer to avoid the restrictions associated with traditional investment funding for the following reasons:  
Instead of focusing on investor returns we would rather pay developers higher royalties and reduce their development costs. 
Instead of meeting analyst earnings estimates we prefer to charge lower monthly subscriptions.
Instead of stifling innovation and creativity because it is considered too risky we want it to flow throughout our organization.
Instead of answering to a Board of Directors we prefer to listen to our developers and subscribers.
Instead of reducing payroll to boast profits we want to hire more employees and provide better service / support to our developers, subscribers, and other business partners.

Streaming and Encryption Technology (SET) - This piracy resistant online distribution system is the core of the Interactive Content Delivery System.  
Graphical Environment Manipulation System (GEMS) Language –  An enhancement to SET, this high level scripting language enables a single programmer to do the work of ten programmers.  
Foundation Library – This provides developers with a starting point when using GEMS.       
AI Library –A prepackaged system for directing the behavior of non-player characters.    
Demo – Demonstrates the capabilities of SET and its’ subsequent add-ons.      
GEMS PC Browsers – Initial versions will cover Linux, Mac, and Windows. 
GEMS Mobile Browsers – Initial versions will cover Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile. 
GEMS Leveling Author – This enables developers to create large environments under SET. 
GEMS Modeling Author –Object-oriented modeling software.  It has huge compression advantages which allow large, highly detailed environments to be downloaded in seconds.  This enables a single commercial artist to do the work of seven commercial artists.          
3D Rendering Engine –A restriction and royalty-free 3D engine optimized for the Interactive Content Delivery System.

The Impact


Benefits for Developers
Imagine having the freedom to concentrate solely on the development of great MMOs.  As your publisher, Massive Breakthroughs will take care of all the hosting, marketing, and support for your creations.
Bottom Line: Focus on what you do best and let Massive Breakthroughs take care of the rest. 
Our proprietary Interactive Content Delivery System will be made available free of charge to any developer who selects Massive Breakthroughs as their publisher.  With these development tools, developers can create top-notch games at a fraction of traditional costs and times, without sacrificing quality. 
Developers can earn significant royalties month after month.  As long as subscribers play your games, you will continue to get paid.  The more they play, you more you earn.
Developers can create a small portion of their game, and get feedback from consumers prior to investing massive resources into their efforts.  If the game is favorably received, they can start generating revenue immediately while simultaneously developing new levels.  On the other hand, if feedback is unfavorable, they have the ability to make modifications early in the development process. 
Cross-platform compatibility enables a developer to create a game once and have it be accessible across many different platforms.  Since they are developing for the Massive Breakthroughs system instead of specific platforms (consoles, PC, and wireless), new platform specifications and release dates are no longer concerns.  As new platforms are introduced, Massive Breakthroughs will create browsers for them. This significantly increases your potential market, without requiring additional work from you.
Massive Breakthroughs’ multi-tracking capability allows developers to edit parts of their games to cater to a specific audience.  Parents can select the appropriate level of graphic detail and language, allowing foul language or intense violence to be replaced with content that is more appropriate for younger players.  Subsequently, developers possess the ability to create a single game that could be played and enjoyed by virtually every member of the family. 
Benefits for Gamers
No long term commitment required.  Pay month to month.  Stay a subscriber and your subscription price never goes up.   Refer your friends and earn residual commissions.  
For only $25 per month, subscribers will have full access to all of our MMOs.  No hardcopies or expansion packs.  No advertising.  Just great game play!!!
Our gaming website will launch with five games and additional MMOs will be added on a quarterly basis.

 MMO Ratings Classifications

Everyone [E] - Content is generally suitable for all ages.
Teen [T] – Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up.
Mature [M] – Content is generally suitable for ages 17 or older.

Players can play our MMOs via a PC, smartphone, or tablet.  Games can be transferred back and forth between any of these devices.   So gaming can continue on the go.
Minimum Personal Computer Requirements:

Hardware: 2.3 GHz processor, 2 GB RAM, and 100 MB available HD space.
Internet Speed: At least 1 MBPS upload / download
Operating System: Windows 7 or higher; Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard or higher.

Minimum Smartphone Requirements:

Hardware: 1.6 GHz processor and 100 MB available storage space. 
Internet Speed: 3G or higher

Operating System:  Android 4.2 or higher; Mac iOS 6.1.3 or higher; Windows Mobile 8 or higher.

Play at your convenience. To assist subscribers with any problems or answer any questions, we provide customer service on a 24/7/52 basis.    
Benefits for Parents
As parents, Massive Breakthroughs co-founders John Keller and Steven Moher, understand the importance of being able to influence the activities of your children.  Subsequently, extensive parental controls are built into our browsers.  
Each of our MMOs is awarded a rating classification.   A synopsis of each MMO is also provided.  Armed with this knowledge and the parental controls, parents can block inappropriate MMOs from their children.       
Parents may also use the parental controls to determine how often their children can play the MMOs.  They can set a certain number of hours per month, week, or day.  They can set a time range to cover certain hours of the day.  Furthermore, different settings can be established for every member of the family.   
Low cost is another benefit for parents.  For only $25 per month, a subscriber will have access to all our MMOs (excluding the ones blocked by the parents). This is significant, especially if your children are very avid gamers.
Our gaming website will launch with five games and additional MMOs will be added on a quarterly basis. Subscribers can play our MMOs via a PC, smartphone, or tablet.  Games can be transferred back and forth between any of these devices, so gaming can continue on the go.

<h2>Psave Pseudoburger</h2>
Psave Pseudoburger is a point-and-click adventure game about a failing multinational hamburger chain and the man who pulls it back from the brink.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You play as an employee of Pseudoburger's corporate headquarters. What's more, you've just been promoted! Unfortunately your new position is so obscure that no one knows what you're supposed to be doing. Consequently, it falls on you to solve all of the company's largest problems and save... ehrm <em>psave</em> Pseudoburger.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I plan to release the game DRM-free for Windows and Linux.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What's the money for? What's the plan?</h3>
The main purpose of this campaign is to help pay for music, sound effects and other things that I can't do myself. That's what I need to handle first.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The secondary purpose is to offset my living costs. The concept there is simple; the less time I have to spend making money to live on, the more time I'll have to work on Pseudoburger.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I meet my goal with this campaign then I'll be able to work on the game full time for at least 6 months, which will to be enough to finish the game, or get very close to it.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Why Flexible Funding?</h3>
<p>I've been working on this game for the last seven months and I'm not about to stop before it's complete. No matter what happens with this Indiegogo campaign I'm going to keep at it. So there's no risk in getting less than my goal; It just means that everything's going to take a little longer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Don't have any money but you still want to help?</h3>
<div>
<p>Do you know anyone else who's interested in adventure games, indie games, or both? Or someone who isn't interested in either but is really free with their money? Let them know about this campaign!</p>
<p>Another thing you could do is subscribe to my youtube channel. Thumbing up my videos or leaving the odd comment is an easy way to help me promote the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's the 'Package Access' perk all about?</h3>
<p>Package Access gives you access to all of the nuts and bolts that make Psave Pseudoburger run. You can use that to make your own games! If you wanted to make a very similar game (a 3d point-and-click adventure game) then you'd have most of your work done before you even started.</p>
<p>Because I'm using something called Playmaker, you won't even need to know how to code in order to follow along.</p>
<p>I'm also going to write some basic documentation to explain the systems that I've made so that you can easily implement them into your own projects.</p>
<p>You'll get access to all of this well before the actual game is released. I'm aiming for mid-late September.</p>
<p>Here's what you'll need to make this work:</p>
<ol>
<li>A copy of Unity. This is free and can downloaded from their website at <a href=""http://unity3d.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""unity3d.com"">unity3d.com</a>

<li>A copy of Playmaker. This isn't free, but it's cheaper than most videogames. You can grab it from their website at <a href=""http://www.hutonggames.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""hutonggames.com"">hutonggames.com</a>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For those that know me and those that don't, I'm a marathon freak.  PROUD marathon freak.  Before, I would run for the joy and passion of the sport.  While that part hasn't changed, what has is my focus and determination to make this more than just a fun hobby.  This ties with Olympic dreams.</p>
<p>I'm a NYC Marathon qualifier, and I'm using this race to get as close to a sub-3 hour marathon as I can.  I'm entered into the race, but life hits you at the worst times.  I have no way of getting to New York because uncontrolable circumstances leave me surviving paycheck to paycheck.  I know this is the first step towards my goal of qualifiying for the Olympic trials.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's start with YOU.  Read the right panel to check out what I'll be giving you as thank-you gifts!</p>
<p>I listed a goal of $2,000.  This is estimated for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare</li>
<li>Hotel</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Ground transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything raise over that is going straight into the Hall Steps Foundation, a foundation founded by Olympic marathoner (and American Full-marathon/Half-marathon record holder) Ryan Hall.  Originally I was part of his team for the NYC Marathon, trying to raise $1,000 for the foundation.  First I need to get there!</p>
<p>If I am unable to go to New York, the amount raised will still go towards the Hall Steps Foundation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My goal has always been to make it to the Olympic trials.  This race is the first step towards fighting for this goal.  I know I can complete a marathon, I've done 5!   But one thing is to complete and get a good time.  It's entirely different when you have those 5 Olympic rings dancing in your mind the entire race.  New York has given me the fastest time, and I'm positive I can go back and go even faster.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send my video to friends and family</li>
<li>If you know of anybody/companies that would be interested in sponsoring me, please pass the word</li>

<p><b><u>CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY:</u></b></p>
<p>Behave recklessly and you end up dead. Waiting around

<p><b><u>ENVIRONMENT:</u></b></p>
<p>Harsh environment can be your friend. Use ancient

It can change locations of walls and items... So don`t be surprised if your path
is blocked by one point.</p>
<p><b><u>TRAPS:</u></b></p>
<p>Traps are the main threat in this game. They can be

thought of making a story about supernatural gipsy against an evil,

It  features rail first person and third person game modes with dark, stylish aesthetics and experimental gameplay. It is currently in development (playable) and the release target is Summer 2014, for PC, Mac Os, Linux and depending on funds, android consoles (Nvidia Shield and Ouya), tablets and phones.                                      Game features:
Two game modes : on-rails firs person  and 3rd person shooter
2 characters, 2 player cooperative competitive game
Noir, stylized visuals
10 levels of action, divided in different scenarios. 
Original Sound Track - John 3 : 14

</h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","World of DaedwinA 7,000 x 7,000 custom made world is in the making by talented terraformers and builders to provide players vast lands to explore! The world is built by our own build team and supporting build teams. View the world map here.
Character System - Nations
Upon joining the server players will have chosen their nation. Nations will provide players with abilities at the same time as they balance out PvP to get rid of nasty harassment and abuse! Current nations:
Farhelm (Viking)
Drakmar (Orc)
Alzeria (Elf)
Voronia (Human)
Classes and Disciplines
Our classes and disciplines are carefully thought out to provide each player with unique skills and when fighting monsters they will gain experience and discover even more skills! They will also gain skillpoints when leveling which they can spend in specializations! Current classes:
Warrior
Elementalist
Hunter
Rogue
Nocturne
Divine
Items and Mobs
The monsters you can fight in Daedwin are custom made and can even use skills just like players! They are smart and challanging, but they will also provide players with weapons and armors. The server will feature over 1000 custom items!
Economy
Every player will be able to recieve coins dropping from mobs, trading with eachother or trading with a npc merchant! The system automatically converts your coins into higher valued ones right in your inventory to cut down on space!
About Us
The Daedwin team consists of motivated and hard working people all hoping to create the best playing experience possible. The team have over 2 years of experience with running Minecraft servers and can handle a community with ease at the same time as they provide the server with new features. Everything on the server will be custom shaped after ours AND the communities’ desires.
Daedwin was started by Marwzoor & Deminth in a belief of a brighter future for RPG gaming.

Pledge
Donations will allow us to launch the server and add more features than those that we have already developed. The basic cost for keeping the server up and running will be $60 USD / month although we will expand if we recieve more donations, because they will all be given solely to the server! Other expenses include running a forum integrated site (http://daedwin.net) and advertising.
Donation Goals: 
$150 – The Project will be funded and the server will launch (1 December)! 
$200 – Lootable treasure chests will be added and players will be able to find them all over the world.
$400 – The server is guaranteed to be funded for 5 months and player owned mounts will be added.
$600 – Player owned realms will be developed and all backers recieve 1 additional month of Premium!
$1,000 - Dungeons with puzzles and bosses will be developed into the world.
$1,500 – A new custom made world with dungeons and all features of the regular world and more will be developed!
$2,000 – Quests developed and will be available in all existing worlds.
Additional: The max amount of slots will be increased over time depending on funds available.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Get Jeff to Paizocon 2013!</h3>
<p>I'm a longtime gamer that got his foot in the door writing for the industry at last year's Paizocon. Since then I've been writing for Louis Porter Jr. Design's NeoExodus line. In fact, I was made head writer for NeoExodus back in February. I've won the Lost Spell held by Kobold Press and was chosen as an alternate for this year's RPG Superstar contest from Paizo. (I've got a running list of my published work, with links to the product pages, here: <a href=""http://paizo.com/people/Shadowborn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://paizo.com/people/Shadowborn</a>) On this front, it was a pretty good year.</p>
<p>On other fronts, sadly, not so much. My partner and I have suffered numerous financial setbacks. At this point, we're living paycheck to paycheck and slowly working ourselves out of the hole. Kat is my number one fan and the biggest supporter of my writing career that I could ask for. However, there's no way feasible way we can swing a trip this year. So, in order to ensure I can get there, I'm asking for help from you good people.</p>
<p>At the last convention I learned a lot from panels that were held on all aspects of the gaming industry, and even more from just talking to people like Louis Porter Jr. over drinks. I made some great contacts and got myself on the path. I'd like to repeat that success this year. Both my publisher and creative director will be there, and a face-to-face meeting over the future of the NeoExodus line would go a long way towards moving the company forward. Also, a lot of big names in the industry will be there, along with representation from some of the strongest third party publishers: Dreamscarred Press, Legendary Games, Frog God Games, Super Genius Games, and of course the people from Paizo themselves. It's a small convention, and those attending are well connected with one another and the industry. With your help, I can connect with those people, learn from them, and receive opportunities from them to let my work shine. In time, I want my name to be right up there with them in terms of recognition and achievements. This is where you come in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your generous donations will go to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare to and from the convention</li>
<li>Hotel stay for 3 nights (I don't need a whole room to myself, so if I'm funded I'll also actively seek out another convention-goer or two that need a room and share it with them, gratis, to spread the love.)</li>
<li>A three day con badge and a seat at the banquet (where all the juicy announcements on Paizo products for the upcoming year are announced)</li>
<li>Necessities (food and minor costs like printing materials to run a scheduled game)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you contribute I'll be providing various rewards ranging from my heartfelt gratitude, to firsthand information on new products revealed at Paizocon, to electronic copies of the various gaming products I have written (generously provided by LPJ Design), as well as new projects that will be finished later this year. Some of you can even get an original adventure written by me using ideas that you provide.</p>
<p>Funds over and above my goal will go first and foremost to ensuring that the forthcoming pdf products will be of the best quality possible for my contributors. If enough money is raised, print-on-demand versions may be available.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, all contributors will still receive their promised rewards. If I get enough for the convention badge and banquet ticket, but not the travel funds, I'll see about arrangements to pitch in gas money for any con-goers passing through Spokane by car on their way. My publisher and creative director offered to put me in their room in a pinch as well. Not ideal, but a sleeping bag on the floor is better than nothing.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute, please help out by spreading the word about my campaign, and use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the word out. Thank you for your interest and support!</p>
<p>Note: Those of you that are gracious enough to contribute at the Exalted Patron status and contributing creatively to the adventure I design will of course be receiving due credit as contributors in the front matter.</p>
<p>Update (5/5): I've sweetened the pot a little. Supporters will get 2 Treasures of NeoExodus pdfs that I've written, and Ardent Supporters will receive 4 Treasures of NeoExodus pdfs.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a UMBC graduate with a Bachelors in Animation. I use my computer to work and make a living. I also want to make a new video game - a sequel to (and much better than) my first app, Dr. Voodoo, shown in the gallery. </p>
<p>Freelancing is a big source of my income. I can no longer do this on my current machine, a 7-year-old Macbook Pro which is slowly giving up on me entirely.</p>
<p>Recent medical bills have caused me to get into some debt. I'm struggling just to pay bills right now.</p>
<p>I need to get a new iMac to work at home. This will cost a total of about $2000, but I'm hoping to raise at least half of that. Every little bit helps.</p>
<p>By donating to my cause, you will be helping an aspiring artist reach her dreams.</p>
<p>Getting a new computer means I can finally create games and apps and all the many design ideas I have had in the past few years that just couldn't be made on my laptop.</p>
<h3><strong>About Dr. Voodoo 2</strong></h3>
<p>In this game, you are a doctor. Dr. Voodoo. Your mission is to save patients by playing mini-games. If you fail to save them, then they turn into zombies. You must cure them with your medical and magical prowess before they infect you, too. Play continues until a patient becomes a zombie. Your score is then entered on a high score list. Your overall goal is to beat your own scores, but with the aide of GameCenter, you will have achievements to unlock as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've had some hard times recently and because of medical bills and other fiascos, my budget is tight and I can't afford to do this alone. I need $2000 for a new iMac, but am hoping to get at least half that from this campaign. If I find more work and stretch myself to insanity, I might be able to afford the rest.</p>
<p>My next game is already in the works but I need a new iMac to complete it. It will hopefully be releasing in January 2014, depending on when I can get a new computer. It will be a sequel to my first app, Dr. Voodoo. The new game will be of much better quality, with more immersive gameplay and better graphics. I have added some game art for Dr. Voodoo 2 in the gallery.</p>
<p>Here's what you get for helping me:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 or more will get a personalized thank you from me</li>
<li>$10 or more will get a copy of my new game, when it releases, created on the iMac, and a thank you note</li>
<li>$25 or more will get your name in the credits of the game, a copy of the game, and a thank you note</li>
<li>$35 or more will get a 4""X6"" print of game art, your name in the credits of the game, a copy of the game, and a thank you note</li>
<li>$50 or more will get chocolate chip cookies, your name in the credits of the game, a copy of the game, and a thank you note</li>
<li>$75 or more will get a personal ""Thank You"" on the game's website and a LIMITED EDITION 8""x10"" print of game art, signed by the development team (my helpful friends), your name in the credits of the game, a copy of the game, and a thank you note - CAN BE HAND DELIVERED IF YOU LIVE NEAR BALTIMORE, MD - (hugs optional but offered)</li>
<li>$100 or more will get 4 cakes in jars, your name in the credits of the game, a copy of the game, and a thank you note</li>
<li>And finally, if you donate $150 or more, send me a photo and you'll get an 8""x10"" sketch of yourself, a personal ""Thank You"" on the game's website and a LIMITED EDITION 8""x10"" print of game art, signed by the development team (my helpful friends), your name in the credits of the game, a copy of the game, and a thank you note - CAN BE HAND DELIVERED IF YOU LIVE NEAR BALTIMORE, MD - (hugs optional but offered)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I don't reach my goal here, all the proceeds will still go toward buying the iMac and making the game.</p>

my small campaign! My name is Darren and I hope you will take a bit of time
to read about my plans for a card game that teaches both children and adults
about genetics. My goal is to be able to produce an initial print run of the game and
send it out to interested parties for both demonstration and review.<br/><br/>In May of this year I founded Weyrell Ltd. This company, envisaged as a social enterprise, Has received great support of the East Lothian Council and Social Enterprise in East Lothian. It's goal is to produce STEM based games and generate additional funds for STEM subjects and research in Schools. It is still very much early days for the company but we have great plans and a number of amazing products, 12 as of writing, which are both fun and educational.<br/><br/><p>The idea for
our first game, Amino, came out of a news report about GMO food I watched with my young son.
It invariably resulted in a lot of questions from him, questions requiring more
and more detailed answers… together with lots of post-it notes. I thought it
easiest to look around for a suitably STEM based game for kids. Finding none I
resolved to make my own.</p><p align=""center""><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454161639/i4ekbglsgd6zwwhhrkpa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>How is Amino played?</b></p><p>In terms of the basic game each player begins with four nucleotide cards and one amino acid card. The game starts with the youngest player and moves clockwise. Each player can either play the DNA Codons required (see point 9 on the image below) or swap one or more of their hand for new cards. Once a player has ""sequenced"" their amino acid they draw another. This continues and players keep track of the points value of the amino acids they have made. The first player to get to 30 points wins.  <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468566630/1-Itemised-Amino-typo_wcrqab.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Of course this seemed a bit too ""fair"" to me in terms of game play. I've therefore added in rules for both stealing cards (base pairs!) from your opponents and being able to force an opponent to discard their entire hand. In addition there are rules for players to be able to get rid of a low scoring amino acid card allowing players to quickly get high scores... if they have the right cards...</p><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455013082/luut17ybq8tio7q54dpc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454162522/ph64aozsadjw2or6bqii.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>It was important for me to try and find the correct balance for the game where it can be used both as an entry point into genetics and also as a valid educational asset. I had originally pitched it as a game for high school students aged 12+ but the inclusion of the colour system allowed me to drop it down into the 8-12 range. As such I have envisioned it as being pitched in three bands;<b><br/></b></p><ul>
<li>8-12 Years:  This is where<span> <span></span></span>colour
matching (DRuMS colour codes), simple addition (up to 30) and game play concepts are used as a platform to discuss genetics, biology and science in general. My son is amazed
that all life is made up of long combinations of those four nucleotides.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>12-17 Years: As above but bringing in the biological and chemical concepts into regular play by using the different modes of play. It also introduces the language of genetics in terms of the molecule names, chemical formula and molecular models. <i>In terms of the Scottish SQA Curriculum it supports National 5: Cell Biology (4) DNA and the
production of proteins and (5) Proteins and Enzymes.

</i><p><i><span>It also encompasses </span>Higher: DNA and the Genome 1(a) the structure of
DNA. </i></p>
</li>
<li>17 Years and over: As above but in reality this is where the game is used as a set of flash cards. Though the game is fun enough on its own to be played at any age. <i>Again within the Scottish SQA Curriculum it supports Advanced Higher: Key area 2
Proteins (b)(i) Amino acid sequence determines  protein structure</i>
</li>
</ul><p>Given the factual nature of the topic and the associated biological principles this game can be of use within <b>any educational curriculum in the world</b> that includes genetics.<br/></p><ul>
</ul><p>
</p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454161730/xdp1jffyqthea2ptfcbw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The £500 is
needed for a very small production run of decks that we can send out for review and demonstration. Any funds above that would be used to produce more decks to fulfil backers
and/or increase the opportunities of supplying the decks to local schools. The
funds raised are broken into three main areas.</p>
<ol>
<li>Production: We have a printing
     company lined up to handle the print run with a couple of others identified
     should any issues occur with the first. </li>
<li>Fulfilment: Having all of the
     cards produced and ready is great but I will need to be able to ship
     them safely to the people who bought them. As shipping is included part of
     the total raised will cover that. </li>
<li>Admin: i.e. the cost of the
     funding platform, PayPal fees and the time/calls/ communication needed to
     make this all happen.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>The Deck
Format. </b></p>
<p>Because this campaign is small and focused there is only one perk: the Amino deck itself. It is comprised of:</p>
<ul>

</div>","Amino is a
game of combining nucleotide cards to create amino acids. Each amino acid card
has a points value and first player to score 30 points wins. Games take anywhere from 15-30
minutes for 2-4 players. The game can be played in four “modes” that encompass
both competitive and co-operative play.

The campaign
is looking for £500 to pay for a small print
run to allow us to send out games for demonstration and review. 

The focus of
the campaign is the basic Amino deck of 55 Cards; 20 amino acids, 32 nucleotides
and 3 player aids/rules.

2 further
expansions are in testing right now “RNA” and “Proteins”. Both would add new cards
to the game as well as create new modes of play and assist in learning the concepts behind them.
The nature of the information on the cards means it is suitable for ANY educational curriculum on the planet that includes the study of genetics. Click here for a list covering the UK, Ireland, USA and both the International and European Baccalaureates

Weyrell Ltd is a company founded by Darren Barber with the support of the East Lothian council and Social Enterprise in East Lothian. It's goal is to produce STEM based games and generate additional resources for STEM subjects and research in Schools.


Welcome to
my small campaign! My name is Darren and I hope you will take a bit of time
to read about my plans for a card game that teaches both children and adults
about genetics. My goal is to be able to produce an initial print run of the game and
send it out to interested parties for both demonstration and review.In May of this year I founded Weyrell Ltd. This company, envisaged as a social enterprise, Has received great support of the East Lothian Council and Social Enterprise in East Lothian. It's goal is to produce STEM based games and generate additional funds for STEM subjects and research in Schools. It is still very much early days for the company but we have great plans and a number of amazing products, 12 as of writing, which are both fun and educational.The idea for
our first game, Amino, came out of a news report about GMO food I watched with my young son.
It invariably resulted in a lot of questions from him, questions requiring more
and more detailed answers… together with lots of post-it notes. I thought it
easiest to look around for a suitably STEM based game for kids. Finding none I
resolved to make my own.How is Amino played?In terms of the basic game each player begins with four nucleotide cards and one amino acid card. The game starts with the youngest player and moves clockwise. Each player can either play the DNA Codons required (see point 9 on the image below) or swap one or more of their hand for new cards. Once a player has ""sequenced"" their amino acid they draw another. This continues and players keep track of the points value of the amino acids they have made. The first player to get to 30 points wins.  Of course this seemed a bit too ""fair"" to me in terms of game play. I've therefore added in rules for both stealing cards (base pairs!) from your opponents and being able to force an opponent to discard their entire hand. In addition there are rules for players to be able to get rid of a low scoring amino acid card allowing players to quickly get high scores... if they have the right cards...It was important for me to try and find the correct balance for the game where it can be used both as an entry point into genetics and also as a valid educational asset. I had originally pitched it as a game for high school students aged 12+ but the inclusion of the colour system allowed me to drop it down into the 8-12 range. As such I have envisioned it as being pitched in three bands;
8-12 Years:  This is where colour
matching (DRuMS colour codes), simple addition (up to 30) and game play concepts are used as a platform to discuss genetics, biology and science in general. My son is amazed
that all life is made up of long combinations of those four nucleotides.

12-17 Years: As above but bringing in the biological and chemical concepts into regular play by using the different modes of play. It also introduces the language of genetics in terms of the molecule names, chemical formula and molecular models. In terms of the Scottish SQA Curriculum it supports National 5: Cell Biology (4) DNA and the
production of proteins and (5) Proteins and Enzymes.

It also encompasses Higher: DNA and the Genome 1(a) the structure of
DNA. 

17 Years and over: As above but in reality this is where the game is used as a set of flash cards. Though the game is fun enough on its own to be played at any age. Again within the Scottish SQA Curriculum it supports Advanced Higher: Key area 2
Proteins (b)(i) Amino acid sequence determines  protein structure

Given the factual nature of the topic and the associated biological principles this game can be of use within any educational curriculum in the world that includes genetics.


The £500 is
needed for a very small production run of decks that we can send out for review and demonstration. Any funds above that would be used to produce more decks to fulfil backers
and/or increase the opportunities of supplying the decks to local schools. The
funds raised are broken into three main areas.

Production: We have a printing
     company lined up to handle the print run with a couple of others identified
     should any issues occur with the first. 
Fulfilment: Having all of the
     cards produced and ready is great but I will need to be able to ship
     them safely to the people who bought them. As shipping is included part of
     the total raised will cover that. 
Admin: i.e. the cost of the
     funding platform, PayPal fees and the time/calls/ communication needed to
     make this all happen.

The Deck
Format. 
Because this campaign is small and focused there is only one perk: the Amino deck itself. It is comprised of:

20 Amino Acid Cards
32 Nucleotide Cards. 8 each of
     Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine
3 Player Aid Cards. These
     contain the rules including a list of actions a player can make per turn and the details of playing
     a Stop Codon. 

I've done a lot of work to get the game to this point getting a single set of cards printed!

Additional Goals
Because I’m a)
only looking for a small amount and b) there are no spare funds hidden within
the Perk donation amount I am limited with what I can offer at this time. I will be reviewing it regularly however as I would like to add in additional value for early backers for this game.

As with any
creative project the risks revolve around two key ""delays""

Printing Delays. We have a
     printer lined up who is a) large b) helpful and c) quick. Understandably
     this project will be on the lower end of the volume they deal with. The
     chances of getting bumped are remote but it may happen.  
Shipping Delays. Once printed
     the cards will obviously take a bit of time to get to me. Depending on
     volume it may take a little while to package and ship the individual
     rewards.

I should
also note that I'm the only person associated with both the production and fulfilment

All of that said, I will be as transparent as possible on all aspects of the
project at all times.

</h1>
<div> </div>
<div><b>Q: What happens with the layout data once my house is fully mapped? </b></div>
<div>
<b>A:</b> We have no interest in the data regarding the layout of your house. There will be rules of use in the app's info, and we'll clearly spell out that we will not collect the data that's stored <b><i>locally</i></b> on your copy of Night Terrors - we can't even get to it.  We're using the technique because its the most effective way in order for the system to place elements logically - there are lots of ghost and ""AR"" apps that overlay images regardless of placement, we aren't going to be another one.

<div> </div>
<div>
<b>Q:</b> <b>Why are you raising money again?</b> </div>
<div>
<b>A: </b>Good question. While our first campaign was successful in theory, we didn't get to the number we were shooting for. And in all honesty, even that number was going to be tight in terms of what we had left. We raised 67%, and that's lasted us a long time, but the money from preorders will now go solely to props and finishing this project to the level we want to. We'll have many more updates from here on out, as now the visual part of the project will start coming to life.<br/> </div>

<p> </p>
</div>
<div><b>Q:  How will the software respond to smaller spaces - One-room apartments, studios, etc? </b></div>
<div>
<b>A: </b>We've gotten this question a lot. We don't foresee experience-interrupting issues with this, just a lot of turning around. The beta tests that will begin in a couple months will have a significant impact on how well the system will perform in smaller spaces, as we're hoping our backers with smaller spaces will be willing to work together on making the experience enjoyable, no matter the size of the space. Once we figure out the diversity of spaces we have to test with, we may reach out looking for more people with studio/1 bedroom apartments, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<b>Q: When will this be available for Android devices?</b> </div>
<div>
<b>A:  </b>Definitely one of our most asked questions - <b>Night Terrors will absolutely be available on Android. </b>As we've extended our launch date, we hope that both versions will be available around the same time. Truthfully, we can't give an exact date for this, although it should be noted that we understand the size and significance of the Android market. Our goal is to make affordable AR games for all devices. Our natural language programming knowledge is in Objective C, C++c, and C for iOS. (If there are Android devs out there - please reach out!) We can guarantee this title will be available on Android devices. It will take a significantly greater amount of testing (because of all the variation in devices), and we'll have to get some Java development help, but we're looking forward to working with our Android backers and developers in order to get this working on all platforms. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><b>Q: This has been delayed a couple times now - can you guys really do this? </b></div>
<div>
<b>A:</b> Yes, we can really do this. We admittedly shot a little high on our initial estimates as building out the software to where we're comfortable with it has been a tedious process. We will have a tech demo followed by a 1-2 room beta in the coming months. We appreciate everyone bearing with us. As with any type of new technology, time management and estimation on completion is tough. We probably could've given ourselves more leeway, although there were also some issues that caused delays outside of the programming and development. We're working as fast as we can to get this done - we're fully aware of the implications this may have in terms of mobile gaming, and we don't want to release something until we're totally confident it'll be a great experience. </div>

<p>Bridge Commander 2 is a Fan-Made game, it is in no way Affiliated with CBS, Totally Games, or Paramount. TM &amp; © 2010 Paramount Pictures. All rights reserved. Star Trek: TNG and related marks are trademarks of Paramount Pictures in the U.S. and/or other countries.</p>
<p>Based off the original ""STAR TREK: Bridge Commander"" Bridge Commander 2 seeks to redefine space simulation games with an immense amount of detail and worlds to explore, players will be able to land on planets, venture through solar systems, scan nebulae, chase down maquis raiders, and defend whichever race they choose to call home, which includes but is not limited to:<br/><br/>The Federation / Starfleet (Civilian)<br/>The Klingon Empire<br/>The Cardassian Union<br/>The Romulan Star Empire<br/>The Dominion</p>
<p>And many more races as time progresses and as funding is more successful we will add more races to the game.</p>
<p>Bridge Commander 2 is a sort of spiritual successor to ""STAR TREK: Bridge Commander"", the original Bridge Commander had lots of good ideas, however, they were incomplete, and the game lacked much, including but not limited to: Dynamic environments, realistic planets, planetary rings, Immense environments, such as large areas of space, and many more graphical and engine features that most people take advantage of in today's technological world. It is not a 1:1 remake, but it's an attempt to improve upon the idea of Bridge Commander.  </p>
<p>My goals are simple, finish the AI Architecture, get weapons completed (mainly beam weapons at this point), finish shields, finish the warp drive systems, make more star systems, implement multiplayer, and try to get a development build out within the next 2 months, to do this i will need to hire programmers.</p>
<p>The current status of the project is estimated around here..: Models/Textures: 50%</p>
<p>Programming: 35%</p>
<p>Quests: 0%</p>
<p>Universe (Planets, stars, systems, etc...): 5% (it's a very large and detailed universe)</p>

<br/></span></div>","Bridge Commander 2 is a Fan-Made game, it is in no way Affiliated with CBS, Totally Games, or Paramount. TM & © 2010 Paramount Pictures. All rights reserved. Star Trek: TNG and related marks are trademarks of Paramount Pictures in the U.S. and/or other countries.
Based off the original ""STAR TREK: Bridge Commander"" Bridge Commander 2 seeks to redefine space simulation games with an immense amount of detail and worlds to explore, players will be able to land on planets, venture through solar systems, scan nebulae, chase down maquis raiders, and defend whichever race they choose to call home, which includes but is not limited to:The Federation / Starfleet (Civilian)The Klingon EmpireThe Cardassian UnionThe Romulan Star EmpireThe Dominion
And many more races as time progresses and as funding is more successful we will add more races to the game.
Bridge Commander 2 is a sort of spiritual successor to ""STAR TREK: Bridge Commander"", the original Bridge Commander had lots of good ideas, however, they were incomplete, and the game lacked much, including but not limited to: Dynamic environments, realistic planets, planetary rings, Immense environments, such as large areas of space, and many more graphical and engine features that most people take advantage of in today's technological world. It is not a 1:1 remake, but it's an attempt to improve upon the idea of Bridge Commander.  
My goals are simple, finish the AI Architecture, get weapons completed (mainly beam weapons at this point), finish shields, finish the warp drive systems, make more star systems, implement multiplayer, and try to get a development build out within the next 2 months, to do this i will need to hire programmers.
The current status of the project is estimated around here..: Models/Textures: 50%
Programming: 35%
Quests: 0%
Universe (Planets, stars, systems, etc...): 5% (it's a very large and detailed universe)
a rough estimate would place the game in 100% completion in late 2014 if funding goals are met and i am able to hire some help.  
BC2 features things never before completed in other space simulation games, for example: Land on planets you or the AI can do the work on this one Fly through planets rings, destroy asteroid fields and mine their contents. 
BC2 will not limit you to only a military career in whichever government you choose (Federation, Cardassian, Romulan, Etc...) but you will be able to be a civilian just mining precious metals, or trading, or whatever it is you want to do, ships will feature soft-body deformation, you'll be able to rip your ship apart if you really want to, or if you don't want to, just put a torpedo through the hull of your enemy.

I'm a youtuber of sorts who also likes livestreams and alcohol. This Idea came about when I was streaming and ran out of alcohol for my drinking game. The audience wanted me to keep going but I said I couldn't afford unlimited alcohol. So this was recommended. </p><h2><strong>So what are the rules?</strong></h2><p>This may very depending on the popularity of donating as I don't feel like dying of alcohol poisoning. Right now I'm thinking.</p><p><strong>Shots at 2$ 4$ 8$ 10$ 20$ and Double from there resetting after every stream.</strong></p><h2><strong>But that's more than the cost of the alcohol what happens to the rest of the money?</strong></h2><p>With any extra money I make I'll be buying new computer/recording equipment.

The Mass Tournament Project (MTP) is a multi-layered game system that I designed.  It is the world's first true mass tournament system.  It is unique because it:
allows ultra-mass scale competition
engages all competitors at the same task at the same time
requires very little bandwidth
is an original design; created specifically for mass tournament play

A single tournament can accommodate any number of players; and 1-in-15 players will always earn a prize that is at least equal to their entry fee (1-in 10 when a tournament's volume is really high).Practice play is free for all.  Members will have unlimited practice play.  All pledgers will have membership privileges (see Perks).$2,000 Minimum Top Prize GuaranteesTwo of the four tournaments starting at the launch will offer members guaranteed minimum top prizes.  They are the Daily MTP and the College Open Tourneys (COTs).  Visitors (non-members) will also enjoy large top prizes if they win, just not at much as members.  (See ""The MTP Game"" below.)Why members?  Membership fees will allow our team to operate the system more consistently.  They will also be the primary source for the top prize guarantees.The MTP GameThe MTP Game is a word game designed specifically for mass tournament play.  It uses hexagonal tiles (as shown below) to allow players to make words in any direction.Players will be able to select letter sets in both 2D or 3D formats.  A variety of sets will be available -- even black-and-white -- to let each player choose their favorites for practice play.A Game That Everyone Can PlayOne of the great things about word games is that they have almost universal appeal.  That's why we chose the word-game genre as the first in our series.More than 100 million people play word games every week in English alone.  And you don't have to be in love with word games to benefit from the system.  Players of all levels of competency will earn money from the system.  So, you might even use what you earn to play games that you might like more.Level One: The LaunchThere are more than 50 levels to the MTP game.  At the launch, we'll be releasing Level One for all practice play and tournament applications.  Within six months after the launch, five-to-ten additional levels will be coded in for your enjoyment.As well, the initial game will be in English (with words common to US, UK, Canada, India, and Australia).  As funds allow, we will add additional languages to the system.  And the dictionaries will constantly be updated.There are more than a trillion field solutions in Level One alone, so you'll always be exposed to great challenges when you play.The illustration below contains thumbnails of a few of the many thousands of Level One challenges I've completed during the design process.The MTP Tournaments: Making History
 When you pledge, you will become part of online games history.  You will be among the people helping to make online games fair, not only for businesses but for players as well.Here are a few of the VBG Rules that help to make the MTP game fair to all players:

competitive -- the game must be challenging to the competitor

fair -- players must engage in the same task at the same time

diverse -- the system must separate players according to ability

not gambling -- success must be based on player effort, not chance

non-trivial prizes -- player earnings no less than contest entry fee
The MTP meets and exceeds all of the basic VBG criteria as defined above.  One out of every fifteen players will earn money from participating in each of the MTP tournaments.The Launch TournamentsThe launch version of the MTP will include individual practice play and massively scalable tournament play as follows:

FREE online practice play -- unlimited to members; monthly limit to others

Beginners Tournament -- occurring multiple times per day; high-level players not allowed

Challenger Tournament -- occurs multiple times per day; more difficult than Beginners Tournament

The College Open Tourney (COT) -- weekly event open to COT members only; must be 16-29 years old (intended for college and high school students); more difficult than Beginners Tournament; guaranteed min. top prize of $2,000 US


The Daily MTP -- occurs once daily in each the PST and EST time zones; this is the first of the official tournaments that will lead to the annual championship contest; more difficult than Beginners Tournament; guaranteed minimum top prize of $2,000 US

And there's a lot more.  So Pledge Now.We've spent an awful lot of time designing a system with benefits for players who love to play casual games.  Here's a little peek at some of the features we'll be adding after the launch:

<ul>
<li>First, and most importantly to us, YOU the supporters will get to choose the location of the museum. In fact, it is important enough to us that we aren't using Kickstarter simply because they required us to choose a location before they would approve us</li>
<li>Second, the story of the game will be told in a way that will be interesting for you whether you played a few times in college two decades ago, or you've played every week since the game came out in the 1970's.</li>
<li>Third, we will preserve all parts of the game - from rare unpublished manuscripts, to the module that everyone remembers playing.<em><br/></em>
</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>THE THOUGHTS BEHIND THE MUSEUM:</p>
<p>For many years, we’ve been thinking about all of the collections that just get thrown out or given away to people who don't know what they are. We personally saw a pile of D&amp;D books destroyed by a local charitable organization. I'm sure the person who donated them didn't want that, and the entire idea of books being destroyed makes us cringe. </p>
<p>Also, we have a large collection personally (which will be the founding collection for the museum). We have no children, so have considered what will happen to our library when we pass away. We contacted the Smithsonian, who told us they would accept the collection, but it would most likely be stored away and not displayed. We heard of a university in Texas (I believe) that had a gaming collection, but in contacting them, we learned that it was not available to the general public, only university students and staff. So we were left wondering what to do.</p>
<p>Then E. Gary Gygax passed away, and parts of his collection were sold. A lot of people said, ""These should be in a museum."" But no one made any steps towards creating that museum.</p>
<p>Then Dave Arneson passed away, and there was a storage shed of his gaming stuff that was sold off at an auction like you see on Storage Wars. Parts of it ended up on eBay, but we don't know what happened to the rest of it. Again, everyone said, ""These items need to be preserved,"" but no one did anything.</p>
<p>So the idea of creating a permanent museum that has been in the process in our brains jumped forward, and demanded to be done now. The founders of this game and the original gamers are aging, and more and more collections like this will be destroyed if something isn't done soon. </p>
<p>Getting across our passion for the game online isn't easy. Maybe the best way to describe it is the way we explain it at conventions: we consider ourselves paladins of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Rather like Varys from Game of Thrones is a champion of the kingdom - no matter who sits on the throne, the kingdom must survive. </p>
<p>Without the contributions of Gary and Dave, the world would be a different place. They created the concept of fantasy roleplaying games. Without them, we'd all be playing wargames. Video games wouldn't exist in their current form (although video wargames may have been developed). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>PLANS:</p>
<p>We will be opening the museum’s new location in 2014 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The timing will be tight, as we have to find the right place to house the museum in a permanent resting place, build it out (i.e. put in necessary walls and ceilings), then design and build all of the museum's displays. But plans are in place to get it done, and you will be kept updated every step of the way! </p>
<p>We have spent a lot of time planning over the past few years, including locations. We have decided to let you, our supporters, choose where the museum should be located. Once we fund, we will send an email to everyone on our mailing list with a link to a survey, so you can vote on where we will be opening (Yes, we're willing to move to the other end of the country if that's where you want the museum to be - we are THAT dedicated to this cause!). There are four locations that we consider appropriate to the game: </p>

<div class=""full-description""> </div>
<div class=""full-description"">LOCATIONS:  </div>
<div>1A. Lake Geneva, WI Where it all started, and where many of the artists and game designers who worked for TSR still reside. This area is rich with D&amp;D gaming history. Also, it is fairly centrally located in the US</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1B. Orlando, FL Dave Arneson taught game design in this area for many years. In addition, it is an area where most people will travel at least once in their lives (Disney World is located there, after all). It would be the most likely to allow international fans of D&amp;D to visit the museum.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2A. Indianapolis, IN Where GenCon (where D&amp;D became a smash hit) is currently being held. Tens of thousands of gaming fans flock to this area every summer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2B. Renton, WA Where Wizards of the Coast, the publisher of Dungeons &amp; Dragons since 1997, is headquartered. </div>

<div class=""full-description""> </div>
<p>FUTURE PLANS:</p>
<p>One of the missions of the museum will be to spread knowledge of the history of the game to as many people as possible. This will be done, in part, through traveling displays at as many conventions throughout the country as possible. (For instance, we know MANY gamers who started playing in 2000, and have never held a copy of the older products, or looked through them to see if there are ideas in them that they can bring to their current game. Likewise, gamers who stopped moving to new editions at some point might gain ideas from new products.) </p>
<p>The museum's first planned expansion will include related/licensed products like Judge's Guild and the D20 products. Future plans include adding wings to the museum for other RPGs. We hope to do three different sections - science fiction, fantasy, and horror. These would include both older and current games.  </p>

<p>All art will be signed with a note thanking you for supporting the museum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FOR MORE INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Check out the museum's facebook page and blog. There are so many details that it would be impossible to put them all here. We've been trying to post as many of our thoughts and plans as we can.</p>
</div></div>","It's time for the world to have a Museum of Dungeons & Dragons. This page asks for your support for it, but there is much that you will get for your donation:

First, and most importantly to us, YOU the supporters will get to choose the location of the museum. In fact, it is important enough to us that we aren't using Kickstarter simply because they required us to choose a location before they would approve us
Second, the story of the game will be told in a way that will be interesting for you whether you played a few times in college two decades ago, or you've played every week since the game came out in the 1970's.
Third, we will preserve all parts of the game - from rare unpublished manuscripts, to the module that everyone remembers playing.

 
THE THOUGHTS BEHIND THE MUSEUM:
For many years, we’ve been thinking about all of the collections that just get thrown out or given away to people who don't know what they are. We personally saw a pile of D&D books destroyed by a local charitable organization. I'm sure the person who donated them didn't want that, and the entire idea of books being destroyed makes us cringe. 
Also, we have a large collection personally (which will be the founding collection for the museum). We have no children, so have considered what will happen to our library when we pass away. We contacted the Smithsonian, who told us they would accept the collection, but it would most likely be stored away and not displayed. We heard of a university in Texas (I believe) that had a gaming collection, but in contacting them, we learned that it was not available to the general public, only university students and staff. So we were left wondering what to do.
Then E. Gary Gygax passed away, and parts of his collection were sold. A lot of people said, ""These should be in a museum."" But no one made any steps towards creating that museum.
Then Dave Arneson passed away, and there was a storage shed of his gaming stuff that was sold off at an auction like you see on Storage Wars. Parts of it ended up on eBay, but we don't know what happened to the rest of it. Again, everyone said, ""These items need to be preserved,"" but no one did anything.
So the idea of creating a permanent museum that has been in the process in our brains jumped forward, and demanded to be done now. The founders of this game and the original gamers are aging, and more and more collections like this will be destroyed if something isn't done soon. 
Getting across our passion for the game online isn't easy. Maybe the best way to describe it is the way we explain it at conventions: we consider ourselves paladins of Dungeons & Dragons. Rather like Varys from Game of Thrones is a champion of the kingdom - no matter who sits on the throne, the kingdom must survive. 
Without the contributions of Gary and Dave, the world would be a different place. They created the concept of fantasy roleplaying games. Without them, we'd all be playing wargames. Video games wouldn't exist in their current form (although video wargames may have been developed). 
 
PLANS:
We will be opening the museum’s new location in 2014 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of Dungeons & Dragons. The timing will be tight, as we have to find the right place to house the museum in a permanent resting place, build it out (i.e. put in necessary walls and ceilings), then design and build all of the museum's displays. But plans are in place to get it done, and you will be kept updated every step of the way! 
We have spent a lot of time planning over the past few years, including locations. We have decided to let you, our supporters, choose where the museum should be located. Once we fund, we will send an email to everyone on our mailing list with a link to a survey, so you can vote on where we will be opening (Yes, we're willing to move to the other end of the country if that's where you want the museum to be - we are THAT dedicated to this cause!). There are four locations that we consider appropriate to the game: 
 

 
LOCATIONS:  
1A. Lake Geneva, WI Where it all started, and where many of the artists and game designers who worked for TSR still reside. This area is rich with D&D gaming history. Also, it is fairly centrally located in the US
 
1B. Orlando, FL Dave Arneson taught game design in this area for many years. In addition, it is an area where most people will travel at least once in their lives (Disney World is located there, after all). It would be the most likely to allow international fans of D&D to visit the museum.
 
2A. Indianapolis, IN Where GenCon (where D&D became a smash hit) is currently being held. Tens of thousands of gaming fans flock to this area every summer.
 
2B. Renton, WA Where Wizards of the Coast, the publisher of Dungeons & Dragons since 1997, is headquartered. 

 

 
FUTURE PLANS:
One of the missions of the museum will be to spread knowledge of the history of the game to as many people as possible. This will be done, in part, through traveling displays at as many conventions throughout the country as possible. (For instance, we know MANY gamers who started playing in 2000, and have never held a copy of the older products, or looked through them to see if there are ideas in them that they can bring to their current game. Likewise, gamers who stopped moving to new editions at some point might gain ideas from new products.) 
The museum's first planned expansion will include related/licensed products like Judge's Guild and the D20 products. Future plans include adding wings to the museum for other RPGs. We hope to do three different sections - science fiction, fantasy, and horror. These would include both older and current games.  
 
REWARDS:
And now on to the fun things... the rewards! We know that you're curious about what you'll get, so below are pictures of the items we're giving you as a thank you: 
Book (note that ALL of the backers will be listed in the book, so if you want to see your name in print, this is your chance!):

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>GOAL #2 - $30,000 - Get the game out the door!</strong></p>
<p>Making a game is expensive!  Between legal fees, licensing, it is going to cost a good 30k to get this out the door. On top of that, BEASTSFURY isn't finished.  We'll definitly have many new features as the time and money allow us.  We will include the things below (onlineplay, characters, story mode) if we meet the budget for it.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL #3 - $40,000 - Get Onlineplay!</strong></p>
<p>This one is very difficult, but if we can make this goal or more, we will do our best to deliver online play to BEASTSFURY fans around the world.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL #4 - $50,000 - Get additional characters and story mode!</strong></p>
<p>This goal will give us the budget needed to add a 12 characters to the game.  Some of the characters will change everything you think you know about BEASTSFURY. It will have amazing AI and include a single player story-mode experience. This will include a brand new final boss character as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
This game of ours, Beast's Fury, is basically a 2D fighting game that implements 3D graphics for higher effect, much like Street Fighter IV. It includes 12 playable characters, 3 of them being boss fighters, each with their own unique endings. Unlike most arcade fighters, each character has 3 different endings. How the game is played out determines which ending you receive with each character. The fighting stages will be of a wide variety, many of which have yet to be seen in any fighting game. From bustling cities to lush jungles to exotic places all across the world. The soundtrack will be made to match the theme and atmosphere of the game and each stage, all composed by sound designers hired by Okratron 5000, a sound studio introduced to me by a friend. I have both wrote the entire story and designed the characters myself.</div>

The Impact


 
To make E-Sports as legitimate as anything else in our society,  Sponsorship of local food drives and soup kitchens. We also want to plant a tree for every certain amount of hours purchased for play in-store.  If we succeed we'll begin a plan to ensure everybody can compete in their respective game in a positive and competitive environment; we also want to focus on the concept of play without pay in tournament situations.  
  Risks & Challenges Our first issues will be launching our first LAN center, and from there the difficulty only increases as we attempt to expand our concept of the perfect LAN center world wide.

<p><strong><span lang=""EN-ZA""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/992933_10200193653753154_1466857162_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Short Summary</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Hi, my name is Joannah Stewart and I run an online geek and gaming magazine called All Otaku Magazine. I studied Graphic Design at Labspace Training Centre and I am self taught in HTML and CSS coding for web design. </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Our project was started at the beginning of the year purely out of the passion my team and I have for all things geek. The bi-monthly magazine covers things like technology, gaming, anime, comics, manga, Japanese culture, movies and a host of other geeky things we can get our hands on. At first the project was just a hobby, something we enjoyed doing but when we started reaching a 600 readers in three short months we realized that there was a business opportunity here. </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">So we started growing our readership and promoting the magazine and it took off, we now have over 1000 dedicated readers in 6 different countries. But we have reached our limit of expansion without funding. For us to reach our full potential we are going to need to hire the right people to make this work. </span></p>
<p>As an online Magazine our company has two main functions. The first is our obligation to our readers, to bring them the latest and most accurate news from around the globe on anime, gaming, manga, tech and all things Otaku (or as westerners like to call it “Geek”). Our second function is as an advertising platform, with potentially thousands of people visiting our webpage and social media sites daily we have the opportunity to connect buyers and sellers in a productive manner. Our ultimate goal is to encourage the growth of the anime and gaming industry in South Africa and to eventually start influencing the global market. We want to be the Danny Choo of South Africa.</p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">We believe that the South African gaming industry has great potential, both as gamers and game developers we show a lot of promise. And with the gaming and technology industries fast becoming two of the most lucrative markets in today’s society it is easy to see why we chose them as subjects for our magazine. But for us to cover these two industries alone would be foolish as many magazines in ZA, both online and in-store, are dedicated to gaming and tech. Magazines such as NAG and PC Format,who have been around for longer and have more experience than us, may have an advantage but they do not have the corner on an up and coming market, that is why we have decided not only to report on the gaming and tech industry but also on anime, cosplaying, manga and Japanese culture.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">But what is our goal for the magazine? We are looking at creating a fully interactive magazine that will allow our readers watch videos, visit links, buy products and fill out forms all from the magazine itself. Not only is this convenient for our readers but also for advertisers. It will allow them the instant satisfaction of pay per click advertising without the time limit set by such an advertising strategy. </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/1012381_10200193654273167_1784811383_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-ZA"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">With your help we can achieve so much. All Otaku Magazine is looking for $45 000 USD. With a budget like this we can set up our entire business inside of a year and be running full time releasing a monthly issue rather than a bi-monthly one and even host events that would boost the South African community like gaming tournaments and conventions</span>.</p>

<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Total = R 50 000</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">We will need to have funding for the first 4 to 6 months before we can start holding our own as a business. Monthly expenses include:</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Internet Access = R1 200</span></p>

<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">The Impact that we will have on the geek community could be huge. Our goal is not only to report on the latest happenings from around the world but also to influence and grow the industry both here in South Africa and over seas. By using gaming as a platform to boost our other subjects we can get gamers and otaku alike to recognise other subjects like comics and anime. Because we are a free publication and we cover a variety of subjects we can also attract far more readers than most other online magazines. Our plan is to keep the magazine free and make our money off of advertising, app subscriptions and speciality subscriptions that allow our readers to access specific areas on our site or to receive extra material via email. These subscriptions will be subject to things like easter eggs and competitions. This project is not only about a passion for geeky things, it is about changing the way we entertain people and about advancing digital entertainment in the form of an interactive magazine. And beyond all of the business talk it is really about connecting people and show casing the small guys and their projects when we can. We want to be able to work with both the large corporations and the small guys with ideas. </span></p>

<div> </div></span></span></div>","Short Summary
Hi, my name is Joannah Stewart and I run an online geek and gaming magazine called All Otaku Magazine. I studied Graphic Design at Labspace Training Centre and I am self taught in HTML and CSS coding for web design. 
Our project was started at the beginning of the year purely out of the passion my team and I have for all things geek. The bi-monthly magazine covers things like technology, gaming, anime, comics, manga, Japanese culture, movies and a host of other geeky things we can get our hands on. At first the project was just a hobby, something we enjoyed doing but when we started reaching a 600 readers in three short months we realized that there was a business opportunity here. 
So we started growing our readership and promoting the magazine and it took off, we now have over 1000 dedicated readers in 6 different countries. But we have reached our limit of expansion without funding. For us to reach our full potential we are going to need to hire the right people to make this work. 
As an online Magazine our company has two main functions. The first is our obligation to our readers, to bring them the latest and most accurate news from around the globe on anime, gaming, manga, tech and all things Otaku (or as westerners like to call it “Geek”). Our second function is as an advertising platform, with potentially thousands of people visiting our webpage and social media sites daily we have the opportunity to connect buyers and sellers in a productive manner. Our ultimate goal is to encourage the growth of the anime and gaming industry in South Africa and to eventually start influencing the global market. We want to be the Danny Choo of South Africa.
We believe that the South African gaming industry has great potential, both as gamers and game developers we show a lot of promise. And with the gaming and technology industries fast becoming two of the most lucrative markets in today’s society it is easy to see why we chose them as subjects for our magazine. But for us to cover these two industries alone would be foolish as many magazines in ZA, both online and in-store, are dedicated to gaming and tech. Magazines such as NAG and PC Format,who have been around for longer and have more experience than us, may have an advantage but they do not have the corner on an up and coming market, that is why we have decided not only to report on the gaming and tech industry but also on anime, cosplaying, manga and Japanese culture.
But what is our goal for the magazine? We are looking at creating a fully interactive magazine that will allow our readers watch videos, visit links, buy products and fill out forms all from the magazine itself. Not only is this convenient for our readers but also for advertisers. It will allow them the instant satisfaction of pay per click advertising without the time limit set by such an advertising strategy. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
With your help we can achieve so much. All Otaku Magazine is looking for $45 000 USD. With a budget like this we can set up our entire business inside of a year and be running full time releasing a monthly issue rather than a bi-monthly one and even host events that would boost the South African community like gaming tournaments and conventions.
 

The first thing we would look at doing is to buy assets like computers, a camera and software:
Dell Inspiron 7520 i7-3612 = R12 000
One Graphics PC = R14 000
Scanner printer combo = R1 000
Graphic design and publishing suites = R12 000
MS Office = R2 000
Antivirus and Payroll = R3 000
Consoles for game testing = R15 000
2 writers laptops = R6 000
Network storage - Seagate 8TB Business Storage Hard Drive = R9 000
1 Modem = R 700
2 portable modems = R 800
Office supplies = R5 000
1 Smart Phone for out of office use = R3 000
Sony DCR-SR68 80GB Camcorder(for our Youtube channel) = R4 000
 
Total = R86 500
 
Then we have our once off expenses:
 
Business Registration = R3 000
Press registration = R3 000
Copyright Registration = R20 000
Legal Fees = R12 000
Initial Advertising Campaign= R6 000
Graphic consultant for initial magazine layout = R6 000
Total = R 50 000
 
We will need to have funding for the first 4 to 6 months before we can start holding our own as a business. Monthly expenses include:
 
Internet Access = R1 200
Phone Bill = R2 000
Utilities = R2 000
Bank Charges = R 500
Transport= R1 000
Stationary (Business Cards, Letter Heads, ect.) =R3 000
Crunchyroll account = R 200
Business Insurance = R8 000
Website = R 200
Service Charges = R 6 000
Personal salary = R 4 000
Misc. = R4 000
Tax = R6 000
Total = R38 100 x 6 = R228 600 (Rounding off to R230 000)
 
Making the grand total: R 387 100.00
 

However not all of these items are needed and we would be able to set up the business with a minimal amount of money. 
 
Internet Access = R1 200

<h2><strong>The Story, The Legend:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The famous zombie hunter Hill Country Roy</strong> grew tired of bar room stories about how great a shot this guy thinks he is or how this other guy thinks it'll be so easy to survive a zombie apocalypse. All you have to do is shoot the zombies they say. You see, each of these drunk men sitting in the dingy, dark bar at the edge of town has spent their whole lives shooting at big circle bulls-eye targets. They're satisfied with putting a hole in a piece of paper and hoping that hole might slow down a charging new member of the growing undead population. </p>
<h3><strong><em>They don't know it yet, but they won't survive the first wave and not many will.</em></strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s474/jknoland/7f0b5311.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Hill Country Roy, previously unreleased photo from before the first wave.</em></p>
<p>To help combat the unrealistic satisfaction of putting a few holes in a circle, a follower and friend of Hill Country Roy, named <strong>Anthony ""Meat Hook"" Arroyo</strong> developed a whole new kind of target.</p>
<p>Meat Hook (and no, you don't want to know how he got that nickname) saw people working on their shot at the gun range who were bored, aimless and sad. He saw them hold the righteous power of a boomstick and not be able to appreciate the significance. He saw lazy shooting. He saw disrespectful shooting.  But what he saw the most was a general lack of interest in delivering the boom to the targets at the range.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>
<strong>It was then that </strong><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/dropdeadtargets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Drop Dead Targets</strong></a><strong> was born!</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Drop Dead Targets</strong> is a functional target design that is about to make target shooting fun again. Forget the circles, forget the paper burglars with the black mask over their face, forget it all because we all know where the real threat lies... Zombies.</p>

<p><em>After Hill Country Roy spit at it. Pure destruction.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Drop Dead Targets are guaranteed to put the fun back in zombie funeral!</strong></h3>
<p>All raised funds will be going to:</p>
<p>1. Pay for Perks: You guys are awesome, so we'll take care of you.</p>
<p>2. Pay for initial production run of Drop Dead Targets so we can get them into stores!</p>
<p>Full line production costs have been identified. Materials have been sourced. National and local retailers have interest. We have a target launch date just before Halloween and we<strong> ALWAYS HIT OUR TARGETS!</strong></p>
<p>The team is ready to go, we just need your help! We have set a goal for $30,000 because that will cover all of the costs to get this product to the market.</p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to last the first wave of the impending zombie apocalypse? No? Then you need to start training and we're here to help. The Drop Dead Targets Kickstarter Campaign is about bringing together like-minded people who enjoy target shooting but need an injection of awesome into their lives. We need red-blooded, fully prepared members of the human race to combat the undead onslaught. </p>
<h2><strong>Join the team. Support great people. Save the world!</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>About the Drop Dead Targets Team:</strong></h2>
<p>Anthony Arroyo - Chico, CA - Owner, visionary and product designer. Tired of shooting the same old targets at the range and looking for something to make it a little more fun, Anthony set out to create a better target. Not only would a great target shooting experience increase his overall satisfaction with his hobby,<strong> it would make the range a more fun place for teaching teens and young adults about proper gun care, shooting techniques and safety.</strong></p>
<p>Hill Country Roy - The Hill Country, US - No one is quite sure what Hill Country Roy did prior to the pandemic. He survived the first wave on guts, instinct and a 12-pack of PBR.

<p> </p></div>","The Story, The Legend:
The famous zombie hunter Hill Country Roy grew tired of bar room stories about how great a shot this guy thinks he is or how this other guy thinks it'll be so easy to survive a zombie apocalypse. All you have to do is shoot the zombies they say. You see, each of these drunk men sitting in the dingy, dark bar at the edge of town has spent their whole lives shooting at big circle bulls-eye targets. They're satisfied with putting a hole in a piece of paper and hoping that hole might slow down a charging new member of the growing undead population. 
They don't know it yet, but they won't survive the first wave and not many will.

Hill Country Roy, previously unreleased photo from before the first wave.
To help combat the unrealistic satisfaction of putting a few holes in a circle, a follower and friend of Hill Country Roy, named Anthony ""Meat Hook"" Arroyo developed a whole new kind of target.
Meat Hook (and no, you don't want to know how he got that nickname) saw people working on their shot at the gun range who were bored, aimless and sad. He saw them hold the righteous power of a boomstick and not be able to appreciate the significance. He saw lazy shooting. He saw disrespectful shooting.  But what he saw the most was a general lack of interest in delivering the boom to the targets at the range. 

It was then that Drop Dead Targets was born!

Drop Dead Targets is a functional target design that is about to make target shooting fun again. Forget the circles, forget the paper burglars with the black mask over their face, forget it all because we all know where the real threat lies... Zombies.

First Gen Drop Dead Target
Drop Dead Targets are realistic, 3D zombie targets with a ""Kill-Shot"" Gore Effect (patent pending).

After Hill Country Roy spit at it. Pure destruction.
Drop Dead Targets are guaranteed to put the fun back in zombie funeral!
All raised funds will be going to:
1. Pay for Perks: You guys are awesome, so we'll take care of you.
2. Pay for initial production run of Drop Dead Targets so we can get them into stores!
Full line production costs have been identified. Materials have been sourced. National and local retailers have interest. We have a target launch date just before Halloween and we ALWAYS HIT OUR TARGETS!
The team is ready to go, we just need your help! We have set a goal for $30,000 because that will cover all of the costs to get this product to the market.
Do you have what it takes to last the first wave of the impending zombie apocalypse? No? Then you need to start training and we're here to help. The Drop Dead Targets Kickstarter Campaign is about bringing together like-minded people who enjoy target shooting but need an injection of awesome into their lives. We need red-blooded, fully prepared members of the human race to combat the undead onslaught. 
Join the team. Support great people. Save the world!
Incentives you say? Perhaps a reward for bringing your zombie hunting prowess into the mix? Yes, there are perks that come with the job.
On top of Full Gore Effect First Generation Drop Dead Targets for your target shooting enjoyment, the Official Hill Country Roy approved team gear includes:

Drop Dead Targets Bumper Sticker (3""x9"")

Drop Dead Targets Limited Edition Print (22""x28"")

Drop Dead Targets T-Shirt (Men's)

Drop Dead Targets T-Shirt (Women's)

Drop Dead Targets Hoodie (Men's and Women's)
About the Drop Dead Targets Team:
Anthony Arroyo - Chico, CA - Owner, visionary and product designer. Tired of shooting the same old targets at the range and looking for something to make it a little more fun, Anthony set out to create a better target. Not only would a great target shooting experience increase his overall satisfaction with his hobby, it would make the range a more fun place for teaching teens and young adults about proper gun care, shooting techniques and safety.
Hill Country Roy - The Hill Country, US - No one is quite sure what Hill Country Roy did prior to the pandemic. He survived the first wave on guts, instinct and a 12-pack of PBR. Since then he has become a global icon in the field of deanimating corpses (zombie killing). He's known worldwide for his truck, Colonel Kurtz, his pet sasquatch, Harry, and his boomstick, the Amish flyswatter. The day Chuck Norris became a zombie, a day we all remember well, was thought to be the end of Hill Country Roy. It was just the beginning, but you already knew that.

<p>This indiegogo campaign is designed to support the creation of Barrowmaze II (BMII) and, while doing so, provide supporters with exclusive extras and cool bonus perks.  </p>
<p>Barrowmaze II is the second part of a two-part exploration-style megadungeon for <a href=""http://www.goblinoidgames.com/labyrinthlord.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Labyrinth Lord</a> and other classic fantasy role-playing games. BMII is a continuation of the initial ""dungeon sprawl"" concept presented in Barrowmaze I (BMI) and is intended for mid-and-high level characters.</p>
<p>BMI was a self-funded project published in early February for introductory to mid-level play. You can find it at <a href=""http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=98978&amp;filters=0_0_31807_0_0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rpgnow</a>.</p>
<p>Barrowmaze I and II combine into one large megadungeon. However, they can also be played independently and are self-contained.

<p>Despite the success of Barrowmaze I it was a self-funded project with limited resources. There were things I wanted to add to the dungeon - including maps (print and digital) and additional art - but couldn't given the budget. Your support in this campaign will help me to address both issues and make Barrowmaze II bigger and better.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1003.photobucket.com/albums/af158/Mrkiltedyaksman/Whatisnew.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In terms of the dungeon itself, BMII includes the following new sections:</p>
<p><strong>The Secret Shrine of Set:</strong> This section details the Necromancers of Set, a powerful faction in Barrowmaze. They continue their exploration of the dungeon in the hope of claiming the Tablet of Chaos as their own.</p>
<p><strong>The Forbidden Crypts: </strong>A collapsed burial mound has given entry to a new power group that has aligned with the Acolytes of Orcus.</p>
<p><strong>The Temple of Orcus:</strong> Militant, well-armed, and devoted - each of these describes the Acolytes of Orcus. They recently added some muscle to their ranks and hope to destroy the Necromancers and their ""false"" god Set. They must obtain the Tablet or face the wrath of The-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</p>
<p><strong>The Vault of the Unholy Relic:</strong> The followers of Nergal entombed the Tablet of Chaos deep in Barrowmaze - in a set of crypts covered in traps, illusions, and death. Nergal's most powerful followers remain to guard the relic, including the reclusive Keeper of the Tablet.</p>
<p><strong>The Lair of Ossithrax Pejorative:</strong> Long after the flight of Nergal's followers from Barrowmaze, but centuries before the arrival of tomb-robbers intent on plundering the tombs for gold, an ancient black dragon lived and died on his hoard beneath a great burial mound he carved out as his lair. This great evil has heard the call of the Tablet of Chaos...</p>
<p>In addition to these dark and fascinating areas to explore, Barrowmaze II is loaded with new, interesting treasure types, traps, and monsters.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1003.photobucket.com/albums/af158/Mrkiltedyaksman/Artandoldschool.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Art that celebrates classic fantasy gaming and dungeon-exploration is very important to me, and is central to the Barrowmaze project.</p>
<p>For Barrowmaze II artist Stefan Poag returns as does the talented Zhu Bajie. The wonderful Trevor Hammond illustrates a number of the undead for BMII. Trevor's style is so dark, macabre, and strange that it just would not be Barrowmaze without him.</p>
<p>In addition, several new artists are contributing illustrations including Scott LeMien, Alexander Cook, Stephan Thompson, and Cory Hamel. Cory, a reader of my blog <a href=""http://discourseanddragons.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Discourse and Dragons</a>, commented on one of my posts and since that time we have been working together on BMII. He is Canadian, insanely talented, and a big TSR geek like me - all good.</p>
<p>Also, Cory will draw the digital map for BMII from my notes in both classic blue and black and white.</p>
<p>Alongside a bunch of new full and half page illustrations, I'm thrilled to report that every entry in the monster section will have a corresponding illustration - and I mean all of them. It will be a sight to behold.</p>
<p>WAIT! There's more!</p>
<p>I was always very interested in having one of the ex-TSR artists I grew up with contribute to BMI, but as I mentioned funding did not allow it. Undeterred, I recently contacted ex-TSR artist <a href=""http://www.jimhollowayart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Holloway</a> to see if he would be interested in contributing to Barrowmaze II. Jim worked on First and Second Edition, as well as both Dungeon and Dragon magazines, and illustrated one of my favorite classic modules of all-time - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_City_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B4 <em>The Lost City</em></a>, by Tom Moldvay. Much to my surprise, he was very keen and interested in the project. We worked out the details and I am thrilled to announce that Jim has signed-on to contribute several illustrations for Barrowmaze II - including a colour cover illustration. Woot!</p>
<p>I will start posting some of Jim's illustrations as soon as they are available.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1003.photobucket.com/albums/af158/Mrkiltedyaksman/samples.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Although you saw it at the top of the page, I would like to take a moment to talk about Stefan Poag's painting. This was a lot of fun to do and highlights the terrible Ossithrax Pejorative!</p>
<p>We started with the characters from the cover of Barrowmaze I. We decided that several were eaten by ravenous monsters. With the exception of the magic-user, we pulled the other characters from the interior art of BMI. It includes my personal Poag favorite - a paladin from the Holy Order of the Field Goal. He also gets channel 6 with that snappy headgear.</p>

I was always very interested in having one of the ex-TSR artists I grew up with contribute to BMI, but as I mentioned funding did not allow it. Undeterred, I recently contacted ex-TSR artist Jim Holloway to see if he would be interested in contributing to Barrowmaze II. Jim worked on First and Second Edition, as well as both Dungeon and Dragon magazines, and illustrated one of my favorite classic modules of all-time - B4 The Lost City, by Tom Moldvay. Much to my surprise, he was very keen and interested in the project. We worked out the details and I am thrilled to announce that Jim has signed-on to contribute several illustrations for Barrowmaze II - including a colour cover illustration. Woot!
I will start posting some of Jim's illustrations as soon as they are available.

Although you saw it at the top of the page, I would like to take a moment to talk about Stefan Poag's painting. This was a lot of fun to do and highlights the terrible Ossithrax Pejorative!
We started with the characters from the cover of Barrowmaze I. We decided that several were eaten by ravenous monsters. With the exception of the magic-user, we pulled the other characters from the interior art of BMI. It includes my personal Poag favorite - a paladin from the Holy Order of the Field Goal. He also gets channel 6 with that snappy headgear.

The second illustration depicts the tragic-character Dhekeon - the Skeleton Warrior. He plays an important role in the dungeon (I'll say no more) and is illustrated by Cory Hamel.

<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad English :-)</p>
<p>I'm an individual Italian developer and i make free game for passion, but writing a game alone is hard, sometimes i need help to complete my projects.</p>
<p>Creating games is not my primary job, but creating games and sharing with others is fantastic, and more fantastic is seeing people appreciating my works.</p>
<p><strong>She Be Free</strong> is my vision of a running game with a story and action, the game is ever in movement and the gameplay changes a little bit from chapter to chapter.</p>
<p>At first look the game looks like a usual running game, but it's not, She Be Free is a story of DOT and of her running for freedom and discover at the end if she is really a software or something else.</p>
<p>The full game will be composed by six chapters, five for main story and secret one.</p>
<p>For now i've just developed three chapters, you can try it in the download section.</p>
<p>She Be Free is designed for touch control, but for pc you can use different control systems</p>
<p>All mouse or keyboard + mouse.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The game will available for this platforms</strong></p>

<p>Creating this game is hard, takes me a lot of hours a day, this is not my primary job, but i do it with passion,</p>
<p>The game is made by me only, i've created everything, graphics2D and 3D, coding, gameplay, story, characters, artworks, some musics.</p>
<p>Fortunately I met some very skilled people helped me, they draw some artworks and composed some musics.</p>
<p>For Music a special thanks to:</p>

<p>I have been invited to various events to show my project, but I could not participate because of the costs, train, overnight, equipment, is too much for my low budget.</p>
<p>For example i showed the first two chapters playable of the game to the <a href=""https://rome2018.codemotionworld.com/gamedevs/she-be-free/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Codemotion event in Rome April 2018</a><a href=""https://rome2018.codemotionworld.com/gamedevs/she-be-free/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">. </a></p>

<p>awesome experience!</p>
<p>I need the campaign money to finance these events, show our (mine and my supporters i hope) game and pay people for help me to finish the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>buy material for perks</li>
<li>pay fee</li>
<li>buy tickets for train and overnight for events</li>
<li>buy an 10-inch android PAD ( for android version with touch system)</li>
<li>buy an 20-inch monitor to show the player's game.</li>
<li>pay some professional artist to draw an event poster and picture postcards.</li>
<li>pay professional musician for some music i want to insert in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>If the campaign exceeds what is required then I can also think  bringing the game on IOS or other platforms and improve the graphics with a professional team, but is my dream :-).</p>
<p>With extra money</p>
<ul>
<li>buy a MAC for development</li>
<li>buy AppleStore license</li>
<li>buy Unity license</li>
</ul>
<p>The backers will have unique exclusive access to the content and features created just for them.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Hi ,
Sorry for my bad English :-)
I'm an individual Italian developer and i make free game for passion, but writing a game alone is hard, sometimes i need help to complete my projects.
Creating games is not my primary job, but creating games and sharing with others is fantastic, and more fantastic is seeing people appreciating my works.
She Be Free is my vision of a running game with a story and action, the game is ever in movement and the gameplay changes a little bit from chapter to chapter.
At first look the game looks like a usual running game, but it's not, She Be Free is a story of DOT and of her running for freedom and discover at the end if she is really a software or something else.
The full game will be composed by six chapters, five for main story and secret one.
For now i've just developed three chapters, you can try it in the download section.
She Be Free is designed for touch control, but for pc you can use different control systems
All mouse or keyboard + mouse.
The game will available for this platforms

 but if i have your help maybe i can add more platform on delivered.
 
Try the game and proves to be up to the challenge


 
 
the game does not need installations, download the zip, unzip and play!
You can try webGL version too, but I suggest to download a desktop version for a best game details
 
 

 
DOT WakeUp and get your Freedom!! 
The game starts with DOT (a program with female sembiance?) awake, the barrier vanish and  an external voice tells her to RUN!!

DOT starts her incredible adventure, the player (maybe a programmer?) drives our heroine and helps to dodge obstacle, fights enemys with power up, protects with shields and more.

In the game there are a BOSS-FIGHT! (I like boss fight) and DOT will have to face with his specific skills.

The game will test the player's reflexes and each chapter  changes a little bit the gameplay, for example in the second chapter DOT rides a vehicle called RW-BIKE (Rotor Wheels Bike).
The gameplay in any levels change in first person view for more challenge

Running levels, vehicles levels, flying levels, boss-fighting and more...




In the game DOT will have to face powerfull defence program, this is the first three foe to defeat!
 

 


There are many other enemies in the game that DOT will encounter in her escape from the system, helps DOT to conquer his freedom!
 
Try the game and proves to be up to the challenge


 
 
the game does not need installations, download the zip, unzip and play!
You can try webGL version too, but I suggest to download a desktop version for a best game details
 

Creating this game is hard, takes me a lot of hours a day, this is not my primary job, but i do it with passion,
The game is made by me only, i've created everything, graphics2D and 3D, coding, gameplay, story, characters, artworks, some musics.
Fortunately I met some very skilled people helped me, they draw some artworks and composed some musics.
For Music a special thanks to:
DJSicar  https://www.youtube.com/user/DjSicar
Nick Nuwe   https://www.youtube.com/user/ShadowblazeLU
Teknoaxe https://www.youtube.com/user/teknoaxe
 
I have been invited to various events to show my project, but I could not participate because of the costs, train, overnight, equipment, is too much for my low budget.
For example i showed the first two chapters playable of the game to the Codemotion event in Rome April 2018. 


awesome experience!
I need the campaign money to finance these events, show our (mine and my supporters i hope) game and pay people for help me to finish the project:

buy material for perks
pay fee
buy tickets for train and overnight for events
buy an 10-inch android PAD ( for android version with touch system)
buy an 20-inch monitor to show the player's game.
pay some professional artist to draw an event poster and picture postcards.
pay professional musician for some music i want to insert in the game.

If the campaign exceeds what is required then I can also think  bringing the game on IOS or other platforms and improve the graphics with a professional team, but is my dream :-).
With extra money

buy a MAC for development
buy AppleStore license
buy Unity license

The backers will have unique exclusive access to the content and features created just for them.

Not many other things to tell, i'll be very happy to complete my game and i'll be more than happy if you'll enjoy playing it!
The risks are low because however the game is already in development on the fourth chapter and still some are already playing with the first three chapters.
The game is free and is playabled from all, but backers, 1 euro too, become part of project!

This game was born to be free, i want sharing a my game concept with other and i would like view the game played from many people.

addictive light strategy game designed for iOS and Android. Swiggle is a
 refreshing alternative to Words With Friends - we like to say you can 
play with “friends” but without the “words”. Although the game play is 
similar, there are no letters or words involved, making Swiggle a truly 
international game that's fun for all ages. In Swiggle, the players place tiles
 next to each other as they connect the “swiggly” 
wandering lines and earn points. In addition to playing with 
friends, you can play against the “Swiggle Bot”, the single player mode. Check out our How to Play video below.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-iVkkEVMays%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-iVkkEVMays&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-iVkkEVMays%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>The design and development of Swiggle 1.0 was self-funded by David, Steve and Michael, and has received many accolades.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-size: 20px;""><strong>The Genesis of Swiggle</strong></span> by David Mair<br/><br/>The idea for Swiggle was born on August 27th of 2005, in the middle of the night, when all great ideas are born.  How do I know it was the 27th of August?  I had listened to a news story on the Scrabble championships that year, and how the Thai players, who were less than fluent in English, were among the <a href=""http://www.wbur.org/npr/4818218"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top players in the world</a>. They were memorizing every one of the 120,000 words that were officially acceptable. That made me think: Scrabble was more of a strategy game than a word game to these players.<br/><br/>I went to bed with those thoughts in mind.  At some point in the night, I awoke and jotted down some words on a scrap of paper and went back to sleep.  When I got up that morning, I looked at the words I had written down, “Scribble Scrabble”.  I thought for a minute, and the idea of seeing number-valued tiles forming a wandering line on a Scrabble board materialized.<br/><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/503871/files/20140412154103-Loopit_Box.png?1397342463"" src="""" style=""width: 230px; height: 184px;""/></p>I produced a working prototype, and sold the board game rights to Scribble Scrabble to Hasbro, who shockingly returned the rights to us when they determined that a Scrabble brand game had to have letters associated with it.  In 2006, Goliath Games bought the world rights and produced a beautifully designed game, calling it, Loopit.<p></p><p>Last year we decided to bring the game out as an app. A partnership was formed between me, Michael Kohner (my agent), and Steve Curtin of Shore Digital Solutions.  Since then, we worked to perfect an already great game, which was launched on January 13, 2014 as Swiggle. 

So what literally started as a dream now needs some help from all of you.  Besides downloading the app from our website, swiggleapp.com, or at Google Play, or the App Store in iTunes, we need your support in helping the dream have a happy ending.</p>

addictive light strategy game designed for iOS and Android. Swiggle is a
 refreshing alternative to Words With Friends - we like to say you can 
play with “friends” but without the “words”. Although the game play is 
similar, there are no letters or words involved, making Swiggle a truly 
international game that's fun for all ages. In Swiggle, the players place tiles
 next to each other as they connect the “swiggly” 
wandering lines and earn points. In addition to playing with 
friends, you can play against the “Swiggle Bot”, the single player mode. Check out our How to Play video below.The design and development of Swiggle 1.0 was self-funded by David, Steve and Michael, and has received many accolades. We have also received many feature requests which are going into Swiggle 2.0 and beyond, and that's why we need your help. We, and our early users, believe that Swiggle has blockbuster potential, we only need to take it to the next level - you can help us make that happen.Reviews from iTunes and Google Play App StoresFun and addictive! ★★★★★ by Bantambaby
I like that you can play with friends and
against the bot. Fun but there is strategy needed as well. A really great game!

Great app!!! ★★★★★
by AshleyP2002
More addicting and more fun than any other multiplayer games (ie. words with friends, dice with buddies).

Swiggle... Love it!!! ★★★★★ by Patrice, Patty
Fun for anyone in the family!!

I'm so addicted!! ★★★★★ by NermalNYC
I just started playing this recently. I was getting bored of Words
with Friends and this is the perfect alternative. It's a perfect way to kill time while I'm commuting.

Five Stars ★★★★★ by Aaron Woloszyn 
Great....now I'm not going to get any work done! :)
The Genesis of Swiggle by David MairThe idea for Swiggle was born on August 27th of 2005, in the middle of the night, when all great ideas are born.  How do I know it was the 27th of August?  I had listened to a news story on the Scrabble championships that year, and how the Thai players, who were less than fluent in English, were among the top players in the world. They were memorizing every one of the 120,000 words that were officially acceptable. That made me think: Scrabble was more of a strategy game than a word game to these players.I went to bed with those thoughts in mind.  At some point in the night, I awoke and jotted down some words on a scrap of paper and went back to sleep.  When I got up that morning, I looked at the words I had written down, “Scribble Scrabble”.  I thought for a minute, and the idea of seeing number-valued tiles forming a wandering line on a Scrabble board materialized.I produced a working prototype, and sold the board game rights to Scribble Scrabble to Hasbro, who shockingly returned the rights to us when they determined that a Scrabble brand game had to have letters associated with it.  In 2006, Goliath Games bought the world rights and produced a beautifully designed game, calling it, Loopit.Last year we decided to bring the game out as an app. A partnership was formed between me, Michael Kohner (my agent), and Steve Curtin of Shore Digital Solutions.  Since then, we worked to perfect an already great game, which was launched on January 13, 2014 as Swiggle. 

So what literally started as a dream now needs some help from all of you.  Besides downloading the app from our website, swiggleapp.com, or at Google Play, or the App Store in iTunes, we need your support in helping the dream have a happy ending.

like “I’m OK”, “I’m injured”, “I need help”, “Connection lost”, “Phone is under
limit of charging off” would simplify communication with family members and friends and let
them know what is happening.
In this App we offer some means to help people survive during a war: 
· 
Escape will
help find a safe zone near your location or escape somewhere else;· 
Locate will
tell where to find the closest hospitals, shelters, help providing checkpoints;· 
Spot and notify will
show to your family members and friends your location at the moment of search;
· 
Status will
inform others of your condition;· 
Survival knowledge  will share some advice and ideas on how to survive during a war, for
example, how to make a fire; · 
SOS can help you send an emergency alert with your current location should you find yourself in trouble and are in need of immediate help or rescue.Above are just a few examples of the prototype of the application.The App was started to accomplish 2
goals
The first goal is to make this App applicable
for any platforms that War Survival App could work on (iOS, Android, Windows and
other platforms).
The second goal
is to distribute mobile phones with this App installed to people living in war zone
countries.Your Help
War Survival App is an ambitious
project to make the lives of people during any war easier and safer.  We have
successfully implemented all core functions.  Now we need your help to
finish this project and get the complete product to be applicable for all platforms. 

Many of the basic functions will be available to all people for free. We will try to implement a possibility for an app user to pay for other users. In that case different functions of this app will be available to
a wider range of people. Gaining at least 50.000 USD we will be able to start adapting to many
different platrforms.
Gaining 100.000 USD would let us start translating. The biggest costs would
be in translations to Arabic and Hebraic (as you know some languages are being
written form write to left neither from left to write, so also all the design
should be changed to these languages.
Gaining 250.000 USD would let us hire needed specialists for 1 year
(application is ussualy developed and improved, tested during 2 years).
Gaining 500.000 USD would let us hire needed specialists for 2 years.
Gaining 1.000.0000 USD would let us start our mission at war zones (2nd
campaign goal) and send phones to people might need them.You never know if any
war or terror act would take place where you live in. Don’t be
indifferent to the things you may change and LIVES THAT YOU
MAY SAVE! Regardless of what language they speak, their beliefs and the country they live in, every life is precious.
Let’s save
people together. As many as we can. As fast as we can.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The project and why we're doing it</h3>
<p>If you or someone you know suffers from type 2 diabetes, you are well aware of the devastating complications that can occur with type 2 diabetes. And you also know that these complications can largely be avoided by staying on top of your diabetes and controlling your blood glucose. But, there are lots of challenges to be faced in managing type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes, medications, blood testing. It can be overwhelming. While your physician, pharmacist, and other healthcare providers do their best, they don't have the time to provide you with all of the information you need or answer all of your questions. <em>Did you know that the average physician spends two hours or less <strong>per year</strong> <em>with a patient with diabetes</em>?</em> That makes it pretty clear that it's up to you to wage the battle. Every day. BUT how do you do that? Where do you find the detailed information you need and can understand as well as trust? We realize how difficult and frustrating it can be to find clear, simple answers to the many questions you probably have related to your type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Some time ago, we saw the same situation faced by people who suffer from migraine headaches. We knew how disabling migraine can be, so we developed <em>Headache: What Type Is Yours?</em> to help these people do a better job of recognizing and managing their migraines. We worked with 2 top headache specialists to develop a 30-minute program which aired on PBS stations. We also worked with the National Headache Foundation which asked for our permission to include excerpts of the program in their section on You Tube. One of these <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YuNQIuWQIw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">excerpts</a> has been viewed more than 65,000 times. </p>
<p>As life-altering as migraine headaches are, type 2 diabetes can be even worse. So, again, we'd like to help. We'll be working with 2 diabetes experts who go the extra mile in helping their patients with type 2 diabetes do the best they can to manage their own diabetes. But instead of producing a video program, this time we want you to have more fun, so we're going to deliver the information online using a game format similar to a popular television game show. Like the TV game show, we'll have lots of questions (68 are planned subject to the support we receive; we'll develop more if support exceeds our request). Questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which is a benefit of good blood glucose control?</li>
<li>Who is the most important person on your diabetes care team?</li>
<li>Which is the most effective strategy to minimize weight gain associated with a sulfonylurea like glipizide or glimepiride?</li>
<li>Which is the best choice to raise the blood glucose when experiencing hypoglycemia?</li>
<li>If I start taking metformin and experience diarrhea, I should...</li>
<li>Which is the most common reason to add a second or third medication to control the blood glucose?</li>
<li>A small risk of bladder cancer is associated with which medication?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are examples of questions persons with type 2 diabetes have asked us. But what about you? What questions do you have? What challenges do you face in taking care of your type 2 diabetes? Please let us know by clicking the link at the end.</p>
<h3>Game topics/sections</h3>
<p>Subject to your input, here are the general topics related to type 2 diabetes that we plan to cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overview of type 2 diabetes (comparison with type 1 diabetes; disease course; risk factors)</li>
<li>Reasons to treat (avoid complications; feel better)</li>
<li>Treatment overview of type 2 diabetes (blood glucose- A1c, fasting, postprandial; lifestyle management, medications; overview of recently updated treatment guidelines; progressive nature of type 2 diabetes; blood pressure, cholesterol, skin, other; diabetes as a self-managed disease; adherence)</li>
<li>Common side effects (hypoglycemia; weight gain; gastrointestinal)</li>
</ol>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/142449/files/20131019100931-billionaire-game-board.jpg?1382202571"" src="""" style=""width: 346.9px; height: 286px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The game will also include sections about individual medications commonly used to manage type 2 diabetes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metformin</li>
<li>Sulfonylureas/Meglitinides (such as glimepiride, glipizide, nateglinide)</li>
<li>Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone)</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions will cover how the medications work and the effects they have on different blood glucose levels and other things like blood pressure and cholesterol. As in other sections of the game, a big emphasis will be on watching for side effects and how each should be managed.</p>
<p>Like the TV game show, we think you'll have fun. But unlike the TV game show, the game is more than lots of questions. After all, the whole point to the game is helping the person with type 2 diabetes feel more comfortable and confident in managing their diabetes and get the most out of their medications. For these reasons, each question will include a brief audio discussion wherein our diabetes experts (or you) will provide the insight and tips they've learned helping thousands of persons with diabetes. We'll also include tips from persons (how about you?) with type 2 diabetes in the <em>Personal Perspectives</em> section of the program. But that's not all. Because we think the game will stimulate your desire to learn even more about type 2 diabetes, each game question will include links to relevant, helpful, detailed information. This information will be carefully chosen to complement the information we provide in the audio discussion following each question. We'll include information from trusted sources like:</p>
<ul>
<li>US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</li>
<li>US Food and Drug Administration</li>
<li>American Diabetes Association</li>
<li>American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists</li>
<li>American Association of Diabetes Educators</li>
<li>Others</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, each section of the game will be concluded with an audio summary of the key information from that section of the game. The 'action plan' if you will.</p>
<p>So that's our plan. Will you find this helpful? Do you have suggestions to share? If so, please click the link at the bottom.</p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>The engine behind this project is 3 not-so-grumpy guys. As noted earlier, we assembled a team and produced the program <em>Headache: What Type Is Yours?</em> that aired on PBS stations. We passionately believe in the importance of people being in control of their health. We all have a personal connection with type 2 diabetes. And we all believe that a major barrier to people taking better care of their diabetes is a lack of information and understanding. We're not naïve enough to think that we're going to change the world of diabetes. But...if we can help lots of people with diabetes change <em>their</em> world, feel more confident, more in control, then we'll be satisfied. </p>
<p>Two of us have decades of experience in information technology working with Fortune 100 companies. The third of us is a pharmacist who has practiced and taught in a major teaching medical center, as well as contributed to the development of more than 450 educational programs and medical journal articles for physicians, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers. Approximately 80 of these have related to diabetes.</p>
<h3>$The budget$</h3>
<p>The budget for this program is $24,300. Major project costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>License fee for the online game</li>
<li>Research and development of the 68 game questions, answers, discussion; links; audio</li>
<li>Website hosting</li>
</ul>
<h3>The perks</h3>
<p>We greatly appreciate any amount of support. All persons who contribute to the program will be acknowledged in the game credits. Persons who provide support in an amount shown to the right will receive the identified perk with our special thanks.</p>
<h3>Share your burning question or challenge about type 2 diabetes</h3>
<p>To share your idea, please <a href=""mailto:Diabetes_Guru@fyinow.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a>. You will be taken to a page where you can send us an e-mail. One request though. Please be brief and specific. Once you have sent us the e-mail, you can click the back button to return to this page. Thanks for sharing.</p>
<h3>One final word...</h3>
<p>We know there are lots of places where you can provide your support--financial and ideas. If one of those is a better fit for you, we hope the project is successful. We appreciate your having considered supporting this project designed to help persons with type 2 diabetes better self-manage their diabetes. If you are able to financially support this project, thanks very much. We greatly appreciate your support. We're also interested in your ideas, so if you have a burning question or problem related to diabetes, please click the link below. We knows--we just may select it for inclusion in the game.</p>
<p>And please, pass this on to others you think might want to support this project in some way. Thanks.</p>

We knew how disabling migraine can be, so we developed Headache: What Type Is Yours? to help these people do a better job of recognizing and managing their migraines. We worked with 2 top headache specialists to develop a 30-minute program which aired on PBS stations. We also worked with the National Headache Foundation which asked for our permission to include excerpts of the program in their section on You Tube. One of these excerpts has been viewed more than 65,000 times. 
As life-altering as migraine headaches are, type 2 diabetes can be even worse. So, again, we'd like to help. We'll be working with 2 diabetes experts who go the extra mile in helping their patients with type 2 diabetes do the best they can to manage their own diabetes. But instead of producing a video program, this time we want you to have more fun, so we're going to deliver the information online using a game format similar to a popular television game show. Like the TV game show, we'll have lots of questions (68 are planned subject to the support we receive; we'll develop more if support exceeds our request). Questions such as:

Which is a benefit of good blood glucose control?
Who is the most important person on your diabetes care team?
Which is the most effective strategy to minimize weight gain associated with a sulfonylurea like glipizide or glimepiride?
Which is the best choice to raise the blood glucose when experiencing hypoglycemia?
If I start taking metformin and experience diarrhea, I should...
Which is the most common reason to add a second or third medication to control the blood glucose?
A small risk of bladder cancer is associated with which medication?

These are examples of questions persons with type 2 diabetes have asked us. But what about you? What questions do you have? What challenges do you face in taking care of your type 2 diabetes? Please let us know by clicking the link at the end.
Game topics/sections
Subject to your input, here are the general topics related to type 2 diabetes that we plan to cover:

Overview of type 2 diabetes (comparison with type 1 diabetes; disease course; risk factors)
Reasons to treat (avoid complications; feel better)
Treatment overview of type 2 diabetes (blood glucose- A1c, fasting, postprandial; lifestyle management, medications; overview of recently updated treatment guidelines; progressive nature of type 2 diabetes; blood pressure, cholesterol, skin, other; diabetes as a self-managed disease; adherence)
Common side effects (hypoglycemia; weight gain; gastrointestinal)

 

 
The game will also include sections about individual medications commonly used to manage type 2 diabetes such as:

Metformin
Sulfonylureas/Meglitinides (such as glimepiride, glipizide, nateglinide)
Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone)

Questions will cover how the medications work and the effects they have on different blood glucose levels and other things like blood pressure and cholesterol. As in other sections of the game, a big emphasis will be on watching for side effects and how each should be managed.
Like the TV game show, we think you'll have fun. But unlike the TV game show, the game is more than lots of questions. After all, the whole point to the game is helping the person with type 2 diabetes feel more comfortable and confident in managing their diabetes and get the most out of their medications. For these reasons, each question will include a brief audio discussion wherein our diabetes experts (or you) will provide the insight and tips they've learned helping thousands of persons with diabetes. We'll also include tips from persons (how about you?) with type 2 diabetes in the Personal Perspectives section of the program. But that's not all. Because we think the game will stimulate your desire to learn even more about type 2 diabetes, each game question will include links to relevant, helpful, detailed information. This information will be carefully chosen to complement the information we provide in the audio discussion following each question. We'll include information from trusted sources like:

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
US Food and Drug Administration
American Diabetes Association
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists
American Association of Diabetes Educators
Others

And finally, each section of the game will be concluded with an audio summary of the key information from that section of the game. The 'action plan' if you will.
So that's our plan. Will you find this helpful? Do you have suggestions to share? If so, please click the link at the bottom.
Who we are
The engine behind this project is 3 not-so-grumpy guys. As noted earlier, we assembled a team and produced the program Headache: What Type Is Yours? that aired on PBS stations. We passionately believe in the importance of people being in control of their health. We all have a personal connection with type 2 diabetes. And we all believe that a major barrier to people taking better care of their diabetes is a lack of information and understanding. We're not naïve enough to think that we're going to change the world of diabetes. But...if we can help lots of people with diabetes change their world, feel more confident, more in control, then we'll be satisfied. 
Two of us have decades of experience in information technology working with Fortune 100 companies. The third of us is a pharmacist who has practiced and taught in a major teaching medical center, as well as contributed to the development of more than 450 educational programs and medical journal articles for physicians, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers. Approximately 80 of these have related to diabetes.
$The budget$
The budget for this program is $24,300. Major project costs include:

License fee for the online game
Research and development of the 68 game questions, answers, discussion; links; audio
Website hosting

The perks
We greatly appreciate any amount of support. All persons who contribute to the program will be acknowledged in the game credits. Persons who provide support in an amount shown to the right will receive the identified perk with our special thanks.

How Will I Do It?
In order to bring these people's stories to the rest of us I will produce a webseries in which I will travel to meet with one small Occupation group in each state, interview their members and take part in events with them whenever possible. As I travel the country I will make updates on my journey available in the form of frequent blog entries, social media postings and podcast episodes and I will conduct a weekly online radio show, discussing my journey with callers and playing excerpts from selected interviews.

It is my hope that this multimedia webseries will help to illustrate that the people involved in the Occupy movement are not so different from our fellow Americans.

Why $5,000 for this project?
I'll be travelling by bus and boots and staying in the cheapest lodging I can find that has internet access (most of the groups I am going to meet are not large enough to have a physical camp), but the cost of storing all of my personal belongings for the duration of the project and moving them out of my apartment will be quite high.

I have enough of an income, independent of work, to be able to cover much of the rest of the expense once I get started. I will also have a number of ways that supporters can donate during the project, as well.

What Cities Will I be Visiting, and Why?
The map of registered members of Occupy groups on Occupy Together's site was the best single resource I could find, so I chose groups of 20 or fewer members in each state.

In this persistent world, players will be working together to decide what society they are going to form, as no one player will be able to do it all. Some will be businessmen, others military and political leaders. They will work together, and use social strategy to ultimately decide the fate of WorldAlpha. WorldAlpha is in the late stages of development, the first closed beta scheduled for November 22 to 25.<br/><br/><img alt=""The Story of WorldAlpha"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.worldalpha.com/bank/pageimages/02-story.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Story of WorldAlpha""/><br/><br/>Earth has failed, a smoking ruin. WorldAlpha, the only inhabitable planet within reach, is an experiment in survival. Humanity must outlive its own failure. The escape from the ruin of Home was merely another breath, a choking gasp. In order to breathe freely once more, Home must be restructured, reinvented, relocated.<br/><br/><img alt=""Free-to-Play Browser Based &amp; Mobile Friendly"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.worldalpha.com/bank/pageimages/03-browser-based.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Free-to-Play Browser Based &amp; Mobile Friendly""/><br/><br/>WorldAlpha is a free-to-play browser based game, which will always be open to anyone to play. All players will be able to progress and will not be limited. The design is mobile friendly, so the game can be played on any mobile browser. There will be virtual currency, in the game called EarthBucks, which can be earned, won, or purchased. With EarthBucks citizens can purchase items to help themselves, their companies, their neighborhoods, cities, and countries.<br/><br/><img alt=""Realistic Player-Driven Economy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.worldalpha.com/bank/pageimages/04-economy.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Realistic Player-Driven Economy""/><br/><br/>In the economy players will have to gather 9 different resources such as clay, cotton, iron ore and oil, and use them to produce industrial materials like bricks, plastic and steel. These industrial materials in turn will then be used to create buildings, cars, tanks, weapons, and other end-user products.<br/><br/>Citizens will form companies, purchase real estate, construct buildings and employ other citizens. There will be over 200 different products which will be sold in the marketplace, and the revenue generated will further business, political or military interests.</p>

Crews will be formed to command tanks and artillery. The Map based system will have battles that could rage on for hours. Each battle round will give the soldier an opportunity to fight in a minigame in their tank or artillery or as a sniper. Officers, crew commanders and High Command will have the chance to direct those soldiers underneath them to try to win the war on WorldAlpha.<br/><br/><img alt=""Engaging Politics"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.worldalpha.com/bank/pageimages/06-politics.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Engaging Politics""/><br/><br/>Cities will be divided into neighborhoods which will have elected city councilors, who along with the elected mayor will make tough decisions on how to run their city. Taxes will be levied and collected, and with that money the leadership will have to protect their city and provide their citizens with academies, hospitals, city walls and more.</p>
<p><br/>Nations will be a collection of like-minded cities. These countries will also hold elections to select a Head of Government, as well as officials from each city, to run the nation. A constitution will be written and voted upon. Which of the eight types of government will it be? Will it be Democracy, Aristocracy or Plutocracy? Who will hold leadership, and for how long? When will the elections be?  Will there even be elections? WorldAlpha will have many options.</p>
<p>The media module will let citizens open a newspaper, TV station or polling booth.  It will allow players to give their own views and commentary about what is happening in the game.  Is the war justified?  How to get rich quick? Why you should vote for the Plutocratic party?</p>

<p>Unlike many gaming-related IndieGoGo campaigns that raise money to finance or finish a game, WorldAlpha is in late development, and will be completed without any additional financing.  What our IndieGoGo campaign is about is getting more players to WorldAlpha to make it a richer experience for all players.  We have a modest ad budget, but we would like to expand our marketing budget to attract a larger audience.  So, the $12,000 is going to be used to advertise through the following avenues and others.</p>
<ul>
<li>MMORPG.com</li>
<li>ONRPG.com</li>
<li>MMOHut.com</li>
<li>freemmorpglist.com</li>
<li>Massively</li>
<li>Google Adwords</li>
<li>Facebook Advertising</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
</ul><p>The amount to each will depend on how initial advertising responds on each.  Those that prove to be better avenues will get a bigger budget.</p>
<p>We do have stretch goals in mind such that when we see our target being met, we’ll roll them out. These goals include a translation module and the opportunity to have WorldAlpha translated into many languages.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><img alt=""Who We Are"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.worldalpha.com/bank/pageimages/08-who-we-are.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Who We Are""/></span></strong></p>
<p>WorldAlpha is being developed by indie developer Big Impact Studios.  We are a team of 3 full-time staff and a lot of part-time help as well as a Flash Game Studio, Golden Gear Games.  Our office is located in Milton, Ontario, Canada, just outside of Toronto.  While most of us are in the Toronto area, some of the additional help is coming for those in the US, UK and Brazil. </p>
<p>WorldAlpha producer and game designer, Michael Koehler, was owner and developer of a huge community website of over a million members, and 8 million pageviews/month before it was acquired by a US public company.  During that time he also created several online games and one PC trivia game, which were very successful.</p>
<p>WorldAlpha Lead Artist Serge Chumak has done work on several games including a browser based MMORTS.</p>
<p>WorldAlpha Lead Developer Chris Crocetti has worked on web applications for the better part of a decade.</p>
<p><img alt=""Rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.worldalpha.com/bank/pageimages/09-rewards.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rewards""/><br/>One of our biggest rewards for all supporters is the opportunity to get beta keys for all of our closed beta dates, and bronze supporters and above will have access to our alpha (if the date hasn’t passed already).  This is significant as closed beta keys will be limited, and so by supporting us you will be able to secure one.  To give you an idea, for our first closed beta we plan to hand out around 1,000 closed beta keys above the IndieGoGo ones, and to date we have received over 8,000 beta tester requests. Our alpha and closed beta dates are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpha Test 3 – Friday, November 9 to Sunday, November 11 (November 8<sup>th</sup> cut-off)</li>
<li>Closed Beta Test 1 – Thursday, November 22 to Sunday, November 25 (November 21<sup>st</sup> cut-off)</li>

In this persistent world, players will be working together to decide what society they are going to form, as no one player will be able to do it all. Some will be businessmen, others military and political leaders. They will work together, and use social strategy to ultimately decide the fate of WorldAlpha. WorldAlpha is in the late stages of development, the first closed beta scheduled for November 22 to 25.Earth has failed, a smoking ruin. WorldAlpha, the only inhabitable planet within reach, is an experiment in survival. Humanity must outlive its own failure. The escape from the ruin of Home was merely another breath, a choking gasp. In order to breathe freely once more, Home must be restructured, reinvented, relocated.WorldAlpha is a free-to-play browser based game, which will always be open to anyone to play. All players will be able to progress and will not be limited. The design is mobile friendly, so the game can be played on any mobile browser. There will be virtual currency, in the game called EarthBucks, which can be earned, won, or purchased. With EarthBucks citizens can purchase items to help themselves, their companies, their neighborhoods, cities, and countries.In the economy players will have to gather 9 different resources such as clay, cotton, iron ore and oil, and use them to produce industrial materials like bricks, plastic and steel. These industrial materials in turn will then be used to create buildings, cars, tanks, weapons, and other end-user products.Citizens will form companies, purchase real estate, construct buildings and employ other citizens. There will be over 200 different products which will be sold in the marketplace, and the revenue generated will further business, political or military interests.
Countries, as well as cities, will have the opportunity to form armies to protect their lands. Crews will be formed to command tanks and artillery. The Map based system will have battles that could rage on for hours. Each battle round will give the soldier an opportunity to fight in a minigame in their tank or artillery or as a sniper. Officers, crew commanders and High Command will have the chance to direct those soldiers underneath them to try to win the war on WorldAlpha.Cities will be divided into neighborhoods which will have elected city councilors, who along with the elected mayor will make tough decisions on how to run their city. Taxes will be levied and collected, and with that money the leadership will have to protect their city and provide their citizens with academies, hospitals, city walls and more.
Nations will be a collection of like-minded cities. These countries will also hold elections to select a Head of Government, as well as officials from each city, to run the nation. A constitution will be written and voted upon. Which of the eight types of government will it be? Will it be Democracy, Aristocracy or Plutocracy? Who will hold leadership, and for how long? When will the elections be?  Will there even be elections? WorldAlpha will have many options.
The media module will let citizens open a newspaper, TV station or polling booth.  It will allow players to give their own views and commentary about what is happening in the game.  Is the war justified?  How to get rich quick? Why you should vote for the Plutocratic party?

Unlike many gaming-related IndieGoGo campaigns that raise money to finance or finish a game, WorldAlpha is in late development, and will be completed without any additional financing.  What our IndieGoGo campaign is about is getting more players to WorldAlpha to make it a richer experience for all players.  We have a modest ad budget, but we would like to expand our marketing budget to attract a larger audience.  So, the $12,000 is going to be used to advertise through the following avenues and others.

MMORPG.com
ONRPG.com
MMOHut.com
freemmorpglist.com
Massively
Google Adwords
Facebook Advertising
Reddit
The amount to each will depend on how initial advertising responds on each.  Those that prove to be better avenues will get a bigger budget.
We do have stretch goals in mind such that when we see our target being met, we’ll roll them out. These goals include a translation module and the opportunity to have WorldAlpha translated into many languages.

WorldAlpha is being developed by indie developer Big Impact Studios.  We are a team of 3 full-time staff and a lot of part-time help as well as a Flash Game Studio, Golden Gear Games.  Our office is located in Milton, Ontario, Canada, just outside of Toronto.  While most of us are in the Toronto area, some of the additional help is coming for those in the US, UK and Brazil. 
WorldAlpha producer and game designer, Michael Koehler, was owner and developer of a huge community website of over a million members, and 8 million pageviews/month before it was acquired by a US public company.  During that time he also created several online games and one PC trivia game, which were very successful.
WorldAlpha Lead Artist Serge Chumak has done work on several games including a browser based MMORTS.
WorldAlpha Lead Developer Chris Crocetti has worked on web applications for the better part of a decade.
One of our biggest rewards for all supporters is the opportunity to get beta keys for all of our closed beta dates, and bronze supporters and above will have access to our alpha (if the date hasn’t passed already).  This is significant as closed beta keys will be limited, and so by supporting us you will be able to secure one.  To give you an idea, for our first closed beta we plan to hand out around 1,000 closed beta keys above the IndieGoGo ones, and to date we have received over 8,000 beta tester requests. Our alpha and closed beta dates are as follows:

Alpha Test 3 – Friday, November 9 to Sunday, November 11 (November 8th cut-off)
Closed Beta Test 1 – Thursday, November 22 to Sunday, November 25 (November 21st cut-off)
Closed Beta Test 2 – Thursday, December 6 to Sunday, December 9
Closed Beta Test 3 – Thursday, December 20 to Sunday, December 23
As a big thank you to all our supporters, we are going to have a Sponsors pages on WorldAlpha thanking everyone.  For our Gold and above sponsors, there will be the opportunity to have a Twitter link, website link or Sponsor Ad.
 

Note that the amount of EarthBucks listed for each reward is the total amount for that level. (i.e you don’t add up all the previous tiers of EarthBucks). 












All Twitter, web site links and Images on our Sponsor page must not be sites containing pornography, obscenity, hate, criminal activity, illegal drugs, etc. or be a direct Social Strategy MMO competitor.

While WalkOVR has five nodes and uses motion capture system to track user movements properly, WalkOVR BASIC has only one WalkOVR node that you strap on your knee to get basic locomotion in VR games. On the other hand, WalkOVR LITE has two WalkOVR nodes, and provide better locomotion and room-scale usage than WalkOVR BASIC. However, both of them can't be compared to standard WalkOVR with respect to their features and potential. You can find more details in what's in the box section.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>High performance, long gameplay. Strap and go.</strong></h3><p>WalkOVR is designed for gamers’ comfort and connects to your gaming rig via Bluetooth.  The setup is plug and play.

While we’ve seen improvements in visuals, games, and head-mounted displays (HMDs), the way we experience virtual reality hasn’t changed much over the last few years. In order to fully experience virtual worlds, we need to actually move in those worlds. Lack of a proper movement solution breaks the immersive experience, limits us to the confines of reality, and all the excitement of an amazing VR experience fizzles out like a cheap firework.WalkOVR is a practical, functional and affordable motion solution, specifically designed to solve locomotion problems in virtual reality. The built-in motion capture algorithms track gamers’ body movements and transform them into virtual reality.With WalkOVR, you’re able to physically move in digital games and environments. You can walk in place, you can run in place, you can bend or even strafe. All of your movements are reflected in your favorite game.Let yourself experience Virtual Reality by using your legs properly, in the most natural posture. Use it with almost all major headsets and with almost all locomotion supported VR games in the market. With this technology, you don’t have to rely on your controller, and you don’t need to invest in any weird treadmill contraptions that take up lots of space. You can literally move in place and keep yourself active the entire time.
Top names in the VR industry shared their impressions about WalkOVR. 
   
 
 
...and here we would like to share the gameplay experiences of beloved games on various headsets in the market. We are pretty sure your headset is one of them because WalkOVR has a way to work with almost all of them... 
WalkOVR has been tested with Oculus Quest while using ALVR to stream SteamVR games wirelessly, currently in keyboard mode. Here is a quick and funny gameplay video: 
 The Forest VR is truly one of our favorite games. WalkOVR lets you really feel that survival experience provided by the game; after all, we all need to answer one question: Which one is more immersive? using the touchpad to move around and find life-saving resources or searching them literally by physical walking? 
  Great puzzles need great products. You can play the Talos Principle VR on Oculus Rift with walkOVR. Walk around naturally and solve incredible puzzles just by being in that incredible world. 
  PSVR Compatibility is not as easy as other headsets due to many issues. But we have a workaround! If you are PSVR owner and also have Cronus Max Plus or Titan II (not tested) then you can move in PSVR games with WalkOVR in its Keyboard mode and enjoy the highlands of Tamriel. For detailed instructions regarding setup, you can talk to us or check the FAQ section. 
 if you have a Windows MR headset then you are able to walk around in awesome VR games. Such as Serious Sam VR. Gameplay with HP Windows MR Headset, which is a valid sign for HP Reverb Headset compatibility (not tested yet).  Did you see how a great game Slightly Heroes is? We enjoyed it so much while we play it on Oculus GO and it is one of our favorite games. Playing it with WalkOVR is so much fun.  Are you a Minecraft fan and you like to play it on GearVR? Then we had good news, we are compatible with it too! Just get your Gear VR, connect your WalkOVR to your phone and you are good to go. Motion capture in tiny boxes WalkOVR consists of four tiny nodes with built-in motion sensors and algorithm. These nodes capture your lower body movements and transmit them to your gaming device via Bluetooth.Using WalkOVR is similar to using five Vive Trackers at once.  It doesn't track locational changes but tracks positional changes of your ankles and knees. WalkOVR is compact, cost-efficient and designed for everyday games and apps.
a short scene recorded during our motion capture compatibility for VR Chat, still under development, will be released after shipping your productBecause Motion Capture MattersIn Locomotion, motion capture matters, because in contrast to a simple motion detection it brings more comfort in your gameplay. By tracking your body in real-time, determining the movement you do in your spot or in your play area eliminates unintentional movements and decreases your motion sickness. Plus, it may bring lower body usage in games such as VR Chat.With simpler motion detection systems unexpected behaviors occur and VR users face a hard time in their play area which eventually may lead to motion sickness or dizziness.However, although we encourage everybody to pledge for the standard WalkOVR; there may be some that still wants a simpler even basic locomotion solution. That's why we developed and released BASIC and LITE versions of WalkOVR. For those who want a simple solution for a lower price tag, here is our comparison chart between our products. What is WalkOVR BASIC and LITEWalkOVR BASIC and WalkOVR LITE are the newly released fully wireless but simplified version of WalkOVR. While WalkOVR has five nodes and uses motion capture system to track user movements properly, WalkOVR BASIC has only one WalkOVR node that you strap on your knee to get basic locomotion in VR games. On the other hand, WalkOVR LITE has two WalkOVR nodes, and provide better locomotion and room-scale usage than WalkOVR BASIC. However, both of them can't be compared to standard WalkOVR with respect to their features and potential. You can find more details in what's in the box section.High performance, long gameplay. Strap and go.WalkOVR is designed for gamers’ comfort and connects to your gaming rig via Bluetooth.  The setup is plug and play. It comes with straps for you to quickly and easily suit up. Unlike the other motion suits out there, you’re not required to wear tights or bulky suits. Just strap the nodes onto your chest, knees, and ankles, then move in your favorite VR game.   WalkOVR also provides high performance with its RTOS implementation. In almost real-time, it quickly transfers your physical movements to your digital avatar. Since we know how important uninterrupted gameplay is, especially when it comes to virtual reality,  your gaming experience will be uninterrupted for up to four hours.
Get fit without trying How many times have you sat in the same position for hours and hours while playing a game? With WalkOVR, You can play your favorite games and stay active the entire time. Regular physical activity can give you more energy, help you lose weight, and even improve your sleep.What if we would say you can literally walk up to 5.4 miles in Skyrim? Did you know that you can burn around 500 calories in ~100 minutes during your journey?
Skyrim game map with real-life distances
Burning calories while you are enjoying your favorite VR game. WalkOVR literally changes the meaning of gaming & e-sports.
Keep using your play area and keep your natural posture Keep your natural posture while playing, plus, you’re still able to control your in-game avatar as you do.You need to move with small steps in your play area right? You can still use your defined play area/guardian area with WalkOVR. So you can move just 20 inches in the virtual world and grab your weapon off the floor?You can use your gameplay area as you do in your standard VR gaming while you are using WalkOVRNatural posture is not only standing positions but also bending. You can bend normally to get your clip from the floor and reload your weaponWilling to sit? Play seated as well You are a person willing to play your games seated? We have a solution for you too!Here is a quick and short Pavlov VR gameplay video with WalkOVR while seated.Seated gameplay 'may' be available through a enable/disable function on client interface. Still under development. 
Ultimate compatibility WalkOVR is and will be, compatible with almost all locomotion supported SteamVR titles, such as Fallout 4, Doom VFR, Skyrim VR, and Onward. It’s also compatible with the top VR HMDs again through SteamVR or WalkOVR's keyboard & gamepad modes. Just check out the below diagram, it is easier to show than explaining it with words: Suggested Bluetooth connectivity distance to your VR system is 3.3 meters (max).and just a few examples of the Native VR as well as traditional games WalkOVR works with: WalkOVR's keyboard mode allows VR enthusiasts play classic games in 3D stereoscopic VR That’s not all. WalkOVR has keyboard and gamepad modes as well! These modes not only allow it to be compatible with Oculus GO, GearVR, PSVR or Google Cardboard, they also enable it to support 3D stereoscopic modes of legendary games, such as Counter Strike Global Offensive, GTA V or Left 4 Dead. As you see a few examples above.OVR PortalOVR Portal is our client software that handles the integration of our system with SteamVR. It will recognize compatible games in your Steam library, will list them and will adjust the main configuration parameters of your game profile for each game. With its incorporated self-learning capacity, OVR Portal will even modify some parameters based on your in-game experience (development in progress).
This is a demonstration of the final version of OVR Portal, may subject to change, still under developmentOVR Portal will let you track your own activity as well. If you’re a gamer who wants to use VR solely for health or fitness purposes, then good news: you will be able to monitor your active time, how many miles you walked or ran, and even how many calories you burned during your gameplay. All such awesome features are in development.ExtendibilityWalkOVR is not designed only for today’s needs. We have your future needs in mind as well. There is a port on WalkOVR main node which is reserved for future use. We’re already hard at work on many add-ons and accessories to enhance your VR experience even more. Who know what will be the next after its development: Controllers for mobile VR? affordable haptic packs? one more set of WalkOVR nodes to make it full body motion suit in the future? or many other modules...
WalkOVR designed modular and future in mind. We are already working on WalkOVR controllers for future mobile VR.Decreased motion sicknessOne of the main reasons motion sickness occurs is the lack of standard body motion during your in-game smooth movements. Your brain reacts with motion sickness while you are in a VR experience because it thinks there’s something wrong. It sees a moving environment but doesn’t feel movement in your muscular system. WalkOVR allows your brain to feel this movement and, as a result, greatly decreases the possibility of suffering from VR sickness.  Our beta testers rated their VR sickness level as a 2.9 out of 10 - This is a huge improvement over the average score of 7 out of 10. Are you sick of getting sick while playing VR games and need a cost-effective, feasible solution? WalkOVR is for you.WalkOVR (Standard)
WalkOVR LITE

WalkOVR BASIC

WalkOVR uses a set of motion nodes that continuously track users’ lower body movement in 3D space. Then, in just a few milliseconds, these nodes transmit their calculated positional data to the main processor unit and then to the OVR Client. Once this information is transmitted to the client through the Bluetooth communication, the OVR Portal application starts processing the incoming data and converts it to proper information that SteamVR understands.  
Our story started with developing our own omnidirectional treadmill, the more mechanical version of WalkOVR.We’ve tested the compatibility of this version with almost all major VR headsets and many well known AAA VR games, like Arizona Sunshine, Fallout 4 VR, Skyrim VR, and Onward.Our client application, OVR Portal is still under development and currently different than the mockups we shared above.We need some further driver development and implementations for a few games to play with specific headsets since they use a different locomotion scheme with those headsets than the standard touch-based locomotion.After the Kickstarter campaign success, we asked the enclosure design of WalkOVR and more than %70 of our backers wanted to get the fancy enclosure. In the past month, we’ve worked on renewing the design of the enclosures based on the improved hardware. Now, current backers will get the following enclosures since we are working on its molding design.Beside the enclosures, we’ve worked on packaging as well. In the past month, after the Kickstarter, we’ve improved the durability and quality of the packaging of WalkOVR. We agreed with DHL for worldwide shipment.More importantly, we produced a very limited number of WalkOVRs through the same process we will use for mass production. It was more expensive than standard prototype productions but it allowed us to see major problems right away. Currently, we have already fixed many problems that may cause delays in backer products. We have plan B for many occasions. Please see below as proof of that production:pre-manufacturing samples' production, the current version is already improved than what you see here in this video 
 

WalkOVR prototypes since the beginningCurrent enclosures are re-designed upon request from our backers.WalkOVR is a team of engineers, designers, and developers that met together with the dream of enhancing Virtual Reality since 2016. We started our journey to develop our own patented omnidirectional treadmill.

We are a team of gamers that develops for ourselves, and for all fellow gamers.  
Developing hardware can be a complex process for many reasons: constraints with capital, limited technical and/or human resources, design and molding issues, etc. Thanks to our previous experience and current partners, we’ve successfully achieved many of these steps.Now we’re at a stage where we need to polish most of the things we’ve done so far and we need to finish the development of client software for a smooth gamer experience–but to do that we have to be sure global gamers and the VR community truly believe in and seek solutions like WalkOVR.Following a successful campaign, the funding we receive will be used for ordering materials, assembling the electronics, and facilitating the mass manufacturing of the entire product.We are a startup dealing with hardware and software development and don’t have 'much' experience in manufacturing t-shirts and mugs. Therefore, we focused on delivering our product in the most affordable way with below rewards. 
We already achieved some certain milestones in the past and below features will be provided to our backers either at the time of shipping or after the shipping with respect to our development efforts.DecouplingYour movement direction will be your body direction as it is supposed to be.Motion Capture in supported gamesThis is a hard task and we realized it is harder than we expected but many of you asked for it and we unlocked that during our previous campaign.

<span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Game Overview</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>First of all, what is Undead Infestation?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Undead Infestation is a casual game that you can easily pick up and play for a few minutes at a time but it offers a clear progression and a goal to work towards. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>You play the game as a variety of unique, unlockable characters ranging from medieval knights and cybernetic enhanced samurai to SWAT and other soldiers. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The story goes that the world has been infected with a virus of unknown origin and that virus keeps the dead alive with an insatiable appetite for living flesh. Unlike zombies, these creatures retain their mental abilities and agility so they are far more dangerous than your average zombie.</div>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<div>So how does this game work? The game was inspired by the classic Atari title Kaboom where you faced off against a mad bomber running along the top of the screen throwing bombs at an increasingly fast rate. Your goal was to catch the bombs before they could reach the bottom of the screen and if you missed 3 bombs, it was game over. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It was a very simple premise but I used to play that game for hours on end and have hardly ever enjoyed a game that much since. This game is inspired by, but not going to merely be a clone of Kaboom. Gameplay also consists of zombies running around  the top of the screen, throwing or shooting various infected projectiles at you, requiring that you catch them before they infect whatever is behind you but in this game you will be able to also fight back! You get to play both offence and defence!<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996270/files/20141108060822-UICast.jpg?1415455702"" src="""" style=""""/></p> </div>
<div>You will be presented with a range of characters you can unlock and each of them has a special ability, unique unto him or her. Some slow down time, making it easier to catch the stray projectiles while others destroy all the projectiles currently on the screen. Others attack the creature directly but with a very poor aiming system making contact unlikely. The payoff being that if you do make contact you instantly win either the round or the match, depending on the character.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The game does become harder as you progress through the enemies but the game can be completed using any one of the characters. Each character just changes the gameplay experience for you, making it more or less challenging than with another character.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>Unlocking the next level is done by achieving a success rating of over 80% on the preceding level. Not as easy as it sounds but doable. On the earlier levels I make you work for it and on the later levels I lull you into a false sense of ease before I really make you work for it :D Unlocking a new character is achieved by completing certain levels with a 100% rating.</p>
<br/>

<div><br/></div>I currently have the game up and running but it needs to get rounded off. Right now all the characters use the same projectile, for instance. I need to create more custom and unique projectiles per character. Also, the player characters still need their animations for their special abilities... The game is in dire need of some extra music tracks and sound effects and some of the graphics could really do with an artist's touch...<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As one of the perks I will make the beta version available on my website so you can start playing the game immediately. You will get to see the game progress from it's current working state to it's final release ready state... As a little side bonus, since the game is actually already using the live database it means that your scores will be saved to the actual high scores list and your scores will be the ones people see when they start playing the game :D But I digress...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Apart from the extra animations, audio and graphical retouches, another thing I still need are the various licenses to release this game onto the various stores: MacStore, AppStore and WindowsStore. I have also been testing the game out on the PS Vita and I plan on releasing it on there also, just so you know! :D</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">...and finally, I want to be able to add a few cinematic scenes before each battle and possibly as an end of game story telling what each character did after saving the world. I definitely want to add a story mode to the game to explain why you are battling. Why do most of the infected look like zombies while others look like real monsters? And how did that guy from medieval times get here? What in The World is going on here? What connections are there between these characters?</span><br/></p>

I am Jacco Jansen and I am the owner of myBad Studios.

I first started making games in 2008 and was, shall we say ""discovered"" right after the  incredible success of my first game, Shuriken Practice, for then Mac Dashboard platform. I have since been working as a freelance contractor while working as a full time middleware author.

All my time has been spent working on other people's projects or content for other people so whenever the young ones asked me ""what games have you made?""

Game Overview


First of all, what is Undead Infestation?

Undead Infestation is a casual game that you can easily pick up and play for a few minutes at a time but it offers a clear progression and a goal to work towards. 

You play the game as a variety of unique, unlockable characters ranging from medieval knights and cybernetic enhanced samurai to SWAT and other soldiers.

It was a very simple premise but I used to play that game for hours on end and have hardly ever enjoyed a game that much since. This game is inspired by, but not going to merely be a clone of Kaboom. Gameplay also consists of zombies running around  the top of the screen, throwing or shooting various infected projectiles at you, requiring that you catch them before they infect whatever is behind you but in this game you will be able to also fight back! You get to play both offence and defence!


 
You will be presented with a range of characters you can unlock and each of them has a special ability, unique unto him or her. Some slow down time, making it easier to catch the stray projectiles while others destroy all the projectiles currently on the screen. Others attack the creature directly but with a very poor aiming system making contact unlikely.

The game does become harder as you progress through the enemies but the game can be completed using any one of the characters. Each character just changes the gameplay experience for you, making it more or less challenging than with another character.



Unlocking the next level is done by achieving a success rating of over 80% on the preceding level. Not as easy as it sounds but doable. On the earlier levels I make you work for it and on the later levels I lull you into a false sense of ease before I really make you work for it :D Unlocking a new character is achieved by completing certain levels with a 100% rating.



What I Need & What I still want to do

 



I currently have the game up and running but it needs to get rounded off. Right now all the characters use the same projectile, for instance. I need to create more custom and unique projectiles per character. Also, the player characters still need their animations for their special abilities... The game is in dire need of some extra music tracks and sound effects and some of the graphics could really do with an artist's touch...

As one of the perks I will make the beta version available on my website so you can start playing the game immediately. You will get to see the game progress from it's current working state to it's final release ready state...

I have also been testing the game out on the PS Vita and I plan on releasing it on there also, just so you know! :D

...and finally, I want to be able to add a few cinematic scenes before each battle and possibly as an end of game story telling what each character did after saving the world. I definitely want to add a story mode to the game to explain why you are battling. Why do most of the infected look like zombies while others look like real monsters? And how did that guy from medieval times get here? What in The World is going on here? What connections are there between these characters?

Like creating a character in an RPG, each engineer has a specialty: Narrative, Visual Effects, Art or Music.</p><p><strong>Kent - <i>Lead</i></strong></p><p>After finishing Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in two sleepless weeks, Kent emerged from the basement of his childhood home with a desire to create an epic story of his own. He began his own journey by learning to code and how to tell stories. While building software for robots, Kent invited his friends from MIT on the chase for that dream—of bringing an entire world to life in a video game.</p><p><strong>Ariel - <i>Architect</i></strong></p><p>Ariel's passion for game development began at the early age of 7. His favorite games would often inspire thoughts of new abilities, units, and world lore to enrich the experience. This ongoing desire to tweak existing games evolved into a life long trend of making strange and experimental game fragments. Studying computer science and physics in college have honed Ariel's talents at building procedural animations and interactive media. Kent has concisely summarized him as ""a true painter of numbers, with a vast collection of formulas ready to craft any moment.""</p><p><strong>Cynthia - <i>Artist</i></strong></p><p>Cynthia is the visual mastermind behind the beautiful world of Evergate. She also happens to be an MIT-educated electrical engineer. When she's not showcasing her art, she might be building destructive robots with her Battlebots team or cosplaying as her favorite characters from Overwatch. </p><p><strong>M. R. Miller - <i>Composer</i></strong></p><p>M.R. was inspired by games like Final Fantasy 7 and Sonic the Hedgehog to become both a composer and a software engineer. He likes mashups of the two disciplines, e.g. he once programmed dancing robots for an opera for the Prince of Monaco. These days, he works on his own music (Planet Diver, Slime-san) and alongside other composers on films (Power Rangers, Fate of the Furious) and games (ABZÛ, Pode).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553217699/u0td6gpw2soosvukjk3t.png"" src=""""/></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/StnLntrnGames"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553217728/xaf33xkfaulx0lyxxgzu.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/StoneLanternGames/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553217750/wkrauaffigcmzchwtlrb.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stonelanterngames/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553217777/orfixrcwimv0ktcgnxlo.png"" src=""""/></a></p><h3><a href=""https://discord.gg/xgVyq5S"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553786375/xek9bzfobr23jyjvywpv.png"" src=""""/></a></h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553443509/ffph881cav5x7v2umdlj.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>Evergate is currently under active development.

But you have refused to give up your past; a kindred spirit has ignited a flame inside of you...Evergate is an expansive 2D puzzle-platformer featuring a unique align-to-shoot mechanic. Unleash your Soulflame and harness energy trapped within crystals to solve puzzles, find lost memories, and save your kindred spirit.Windows DRM-Free Evergate DemoWant to talk about the demo or chat with others playing? Have questions? We've set up a Discord server here for everyone in the community! 
 A HEARTWARMING EPIC spanning life & death and space & time 
 100+ PUZZLES with open-ended solutions
 10+ CRYSTALS with unique powers that can be creatively combined 
 MYTHICAL AFTERLIFE steeped in lore
 COLOSSAL BATTLES against the Gods and nightmares come to life
 HAND-DRAWN ARTWORK creates wonder in every moment 
 RICH SOUNDTRACK evokes the magic of Ki's journey
Legend tells that the Gods forge each soul's heart—its flame—from the ancient power of the Source. But it's the unique connection to your kindred spirit that has ignited your Soulflame and awakened the Source inside you.Align crystals between you and the Source and fire your Soulflame to unleash their extraordinary powers. Use these powers to reach the unreachable, confront your foes, and banish the nightmares of your past back to the shadows.There are more than 10 different types of crystals, each with a unique ability. Combine multiple crystals for even greater effect.The swap crystal exchanges you with the Source you were targeting. Time slows down while you're aiming so you can precisely line up your shot.The boost crystal sends a shockwave along your Soulflame, propelling you in the opposite direction.The death crystal sends a destructive wave down your Soulflame, destroying the first objects in its path—even if that's you.Evergate blends cerebral puzzles with skill-based execution. The goal of each puzzle is to reach the gate at the end however you can. Some players may opt for a straightforward route while others will strive for the more difficult complete solution using every crystal. This offers challenges for casual and hardcore gamers alike.All of Evergate's puzzles are open-ended. These creative playgrounds encourage experimentation and embrace a spirit of trial and error. Messed up your jump? See a more fun solution? Hold the reset button to quickly try a new approach.A second player can control Ki's spiritual guide. Friends and family can join Ki on her adventure and work through the puzzles alongside you.The Gods have scattered your memories and taken your kindred spirit deep into the heart of the Afterlife. Search for your memories and reclaim what was lost.The Afterlife is full of fantasies and dangers arranged into unique domains, each ruled by a deity. You'll explore four of these domains and their native crystals. As you recollect your memories, you unlock new crystals and areas to explore.Your scattered memories have torn rifts in the fabric of time & space. The Source has brought your nightmares to life and they are bleeding into this reality. Enter the portals to your past and solve the tangled puzzles within. Traverse surreal dreamscapes and reach the gate at the end to recollect your memories.  While the Source fuels your Soulflame, it is not yours alone. It breathes life into fantastical flora and wondrous creatures. Yet in the shadows, untold nightmares feed off its power and grow... Even your recollections are not safe from its ancient energy. Your childhood fears have been brought to life by the Source. To recover your memories, you must first overcome your demons.But brandishing your Soulflame invites unwanted attention. The deities who maintain the natural order and wield celestial abilities stand in your way. On your quest to find your kindred spirit and reclaim your memories, you must confront these massive, stage-sized deities. Sweet Swag!As a thank you for supporting Ki on her journey, we've assembled a sweet set of swag so you can follow alongside her:  Evergate is a passion project for us, a game made with all our hearts. We are in love with its story, world, and characters, and we can't wait to share it all with you. But we need your help to get there!As our ambitions for Evergate have expanded, we have realized we need more resources to bring it to life. For the past three years, we've been developing Evergate in our spare time and self-funding the production. By backing us, you will allow our small team to:
Accelerate our release date by over a year
Hire additional developers, artists, and sound designers
Release on additional platforms
And much more!
Curious about the gameplay mechanics of Evergate? Wondering about who exactly the developers are? Want to know why the heck we want to make this game? Well, all of those questions (and more!), are answered in our ""Behind The Afterlife"" video. Stone Lantern Games is a budding indie game studio founded by 4 MIT graduates. Like creating a character in an RPG, each engineer has a specialty: Narrative, Visual Effects, Art or Music.Kent - LeadAfter finishing Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in two sleepless weeks, Kent emerged from the basement of his childhood home with a desire to create an epic story of his own. He began his own journey by learning to code and how to tell stories. While building software for robots, Kent invited his friends from MIT on the chase for that dream—of bringing an entire world to life in a video game.Ariel - ArchitectAriel's passion for game development began at the early age of 7. His favorite games would often inspire thoughts of new abilities, units, and world lore to enrich the experience. This ongoing desire to tweak existing games evolved into a life long trend of making strange and experimental game fragments. Studying computer science and physics in college have honed Ariel's talents at building procedural animations and interactive media. Kent has concisely summarized him as ""a true painter of numbers, with a vast collection of formulas ready to craft any moment.""Cynthia - ArtistCynthia is the visual mastermind behind the beautiful world of Evergate. She also happens to be an MIT-educated electrical engineer. When she's not showcasing her art, she might be building destructive robots with her Battlebots team or cosplaying as her favorite characters from Overwatch. M. R. Miller - ComposerM.R. was inspired by games like Final Fantasy 7 and Sonic the Hedgehog to become both a composer and a software engineer. He likes mashups of the two disciplines, e.g. he once programmed dancing robots for an opera for the Prince of Monaco. These days, he works on his own music (Planet Diver, Slime-san) and alongside other composers on films (Power Rangers, Fate of the Furious) and games (ABZÛ, Pode).Evergate is currently under active development. We've shown off early versions to convention-goers at PAX East & West, Boston FIG, and elsewhere. The reception has been overwhelmingly positive: Evergate was selected for PAX Rising; won the Audience Choice award at BFIG; and was nominated for The 2018 Bit Award's Game of the Year and Best Style.This is our first game so we have and will continue to face new challenges. But at this point, we've laid a solid technical foundation and created all the building blocks we need to construct the final game. The first divine domain is done, but there are still three more to go, as well as the mind-warping finale! There's still tons of work ahead, like console ports, testing, and the full soundtrack.Not one of us questions whether the game *will* happen, only *when*. We are all thoroughly committed to the project and have been for three years already.Our biggest shortfall right now is time. A successful Kickstarter will afford us more time to work on the game as well as additional personnel. With the proper resources, we are aiming to launch Evergate in November 2019.As we progress towards launch, we plan to keep the Kickstarter community appraised of our progress with frequent, regular status updates. Keep us honest and follow along as we code the game, create its artwork, and compose its music.Making a game is hard, but we're a driven, passionate team. Our time at MIT and as engineers in the real world have given us the skills needed to make Evergate a reality. And with your help, together we can bring this dream to life.",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Welcome, here's a quick intro...</h3>
<p>GCT Studios launched Bushido last year and we have had an excellent time sharing our world with you. Bushido is a table-top, 32mm miniatures, Oriental Fantasy, skirmish game, where fast and brutal gameplay combine with real strategic depth.</p>
<p>We launched with four factions and grand plans to release more and really fill out the Jwar Isles. Now we have concepted the next faction and our excitement levels have risen to the point that we want to share it with you NOW... And that's where you come in, we need your support to get this off the concept table and released sooner.</p>
<p>With your help the Ito will come to life and leave their island. You can cause the Prefecture of Ryu yet another setback as their uneasy alliance with the Ito comes crashing to an end, the upper echelons of the Takashi clan's fears of an attack from across the Silver Strait finally realised. </p>
<p>You can help us to allow the Ito to finally shed their veil of deceipt and reveal their true nature to world.</p>

<h3>Why we need your help...</h3>
<p>Because we are brimming with so many ideas, so many cool areas of the Jwar Isles are still to be explored. So many factions are yet to mobilise their forces in the fight for the future of the Jwar Isles. Your help means we can realise this sooner, starting with the Ito.</p>
<h3>What exactly will we do...</h3>
<p>The goal we have set will allow us to continue working with some of the best sculptors in the world to create the starter set for the Ito faction. This will consist of five finely sculpted miniatures and their associated high quality game cards.</p>

More Ito models for one thing to get that list building element from the outset. Tokens for all that Ki and so on. A glossy rulebook packed full of art and stories to really bring Jwar to life.

<p>EventingStar!

<p>THE REAL GAME</p>
<p>This will be free online game on either your phone or in your browser.</p>
<p>You challenge your friends to complete hilarious actions (wax their legs, cover themselves with honey, or dress as a wizard) and they have to respond with photographic proof, pics or it didn't happen</p>
<p>We built this interactive friend to friend game and we want to get in the hands of our friends, like you. This game is about adolescent and adult psychological play that enhances friendships, trust and fun. Our challenges can be embarrassing, gross and even crude but they are never offensive. </p>
<p>The system enhances play to encourage interactivity, deeper connections and fun memorable experiences with your friends. The game has a lot of surprises and challenges that will stretch the elasticity of friendships and build stronger bonds. The game is all around fun, appeals to your ego and helps players reconnect. </p>
<p>A few sample challenges</p>
<p>That ain’t countrytime: Spill water or other liquid on yourself so it looks as though you have lost control of your bladder and walk in public. </p>
<p>Wingardium levi oh-no: Dress up like a wizard and cast spells on random strangers. </p>
<p>Rip it: Wax a strip of hair off of your body. </p>
<p>THE REAL PLAN </p>
<p>The game is nearing the end of development. Portions of the game is in testing while cross platform integration is just starting. We want to make the game accessible by all online means. By phone, By tablet, By computer, By social networks, By SMS Text and any future means. </p>
<p>So here is our Release Plan outline. (Subject to Change) </p>
<p>  - Website ready for beta testing by October 1st</p>

<p>Welcome to Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for <b>Generals' Order </b>(GO), a strategy card game by Strategy Entertainment Pte Ltd from Singapore!<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>Generals' Order is a game that simulates ancient Chinese warfare that combines Wisdom (devising strategies), Courage (deploying generals) and Calculation (resource management). </span></p>
<p>We will hope you like this campaign and help us to reach our goals by supporting and sharing this campaign.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/252238/files/20131209225027-IGG_Banner_WhoAreWe.jpg?1386658227"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;width: 593.0588235294118px;height: 71px;""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Eight years
ago, three good friends who are veteran TCG players decided to venture into a crazy yet daring business - pooling their savings to develop an unique card game – one that is
different from the run-of-the-mill TCG and something fun that will entice people to give it a
try!</p>
<p>It was a daunting and challenging task. Firstly, they are up against several established TCGs already in the
market. Secondly, they had limited funds to develop an extensive production. Most importantly,
developing a card game in Chinese is definitely a huge risk but one that they were determined to give it a shot.<br/><br/><i>“We are fans of many TCGs but there is not one that really simulates realistic ancient Chinese warfare. We need a game where there are real consequences: characters who are killed will not appear again. We know soldiers have to move in order to attack their enemy and real army will require supplies. No other TCGs incorporated this rules and design of their games. We want to be the first to do it.” </i><br/></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/295309/files/20140107021649-IGG_Divider.jpg?1389089809"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>And so, the creators began their journey – developing the game mechanism, the characters and
their features, as well as getting the artworks ready. After nearly two years of preparation, <i>Generals' Order</i>, a
Chinese strategy card game based on the popular Chinese novel ‘Romance of the
three kingdoms’, is finally ready for launch.<br/><br/>In 2007, a new company, Strategy Entertainment Pte Ltd was inaugurated.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Strategy Entertainment has
been producing Generals' Order since 2007. Locally, we have amassed a strong player base of
thousands, and have released multiple expansion sets of cards. We have received many requests from
our international fans to produce an English version of our game. After going
through detailed planning, we decided to use Indiegogo as a platform to jump
start this campaign.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/297283/files/20140108013413-IGG_Products.jpg?1389173653"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Generals' Order showcases a wide variety of art styles, ranging from anime illustration to realistic painting. Some of the artists who had illustated our cards include, Stanley Lau, Lennart, Jason Lan among many other talented artists.</p>
<p>Stanley Lau, better known for Artgerm, is a world acclaimed artist from Imaginary Friends Studio. His portfolio includes exquisite artworks for Capcom, DC Comics, Square Enix, Riot Games and other giants in the entertainment and gaming industry. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/256293/files/20131211192151-IGG_StanleyLau.jpg?1386818511"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lennart Tsen, a.k.a illuminus, is a prolific Generals' Order artist who is distinguished for his anime artistic flair. Lennart's artworks are featured in many of our Ultrapro products.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Jason Lan, is responsible for drawing most of our realistic-style artworks. Jason has produced works for Applibot Inc., Paizo Publishing, Fantasy Flight Games and other game studios.</span></p>

<p></p></div>","Welcome to Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for Generals' Order (GO), a strategy card game by Strategy Entertainment Pte Ltd from Singapore!Generals' Order is a game that simulates ancient Chinese warfare that combines Wisdom (devising strategies), Courage (deploying generals) and Calculation (resource management). 
We will hope you like this campaign and help us to reach our goals by supporting and sharing this campaign.


Eight years
ago, three good friends who are veteran TCG players decided to venture into a crazy yet daring business - pooling their savings to develop an unique card game – one that is
different from the run-of-the-mill TCG and something fun that will entice people to give it a
try!
It was a daunting and challenging task. Firstly, they are up against several established TCGs already in the
market. Secondly, they had limited funds to develop an extensive production. Most importantly,
developing a card game in Chinese is definitely a huge risk but one that they were determined to give it a shot.“We are fans of many TCGs but there is not one that really simulates realistic ancient Chinese warfare. We need a game where there are real consequences: characters who are killed will not appear again. We know soldiers have to move in order to attack their enemy and real army will require supplies. No other TCGs incorporated this rules and design of their games. We want to be the first to do it.” 



And so, the creators began their journey – developing the game mechanism, the characters and
their features, as well as getting the artworks ready. After nearly two years of preparation, Generals' Order, a
Chinese strategy card game based on the popular Chinese novel ‘Romance of the
three kingdoms’, is finally ready for launch.In 2007, a new company, Strategy Entertainment Pte Ltd was inaugurated.
Strategy Entertainment has
been producing Generals' Order since 2007. Locally, we have amassed a strong player base of
thousands, and have released multiple expansion sets of cards. We have received many requests from
our international fans to produce an English version of our game. After going
through detailed planning, we decided to use Indiegogo as a platform to jump
start this campaign.





Generals' Order showcases a wide variety of art styles, ranging from anime illustration to realistic painting. Some of the artists who had illustated our cards include, Stanley Lau, Lennart, Jason Lan among many other talented artists.
Stanley Lau, better known for Artgerm, is a world acclaimed artist from Imaginary Friends Studio. His portfolio includes exquisite artworks for Capcom, DC Comics, Square Enix, Riot Games and other giants in the entertainment and gaming industry. 


Lennart Tsen, a.k.a illuminus, is a prolific Generals' Order artist who is distinguished for his anime artistic flair. Lennart's artworks are featured in many of our Ultrapro products.

Jason Lan, is responsible for drawing most of our realistic-style artworks. Jason has produced works for Applibot Inc., Paizo Publishing, Fantasy Flight Games and other game studios.

Regardless of whether you decide to back our campaign or not, we welcome you to our Facebook page and throw us a 'Like' if you will.




Our target is to raise $3,000 USD. We have outlined the production schedule and your contributions will help us bring this game to our English speaking fans. With this amount, we can produce a new English version set, Rise of The Kings (ROTK) based on our existing cards and re-illustrate some of our existing artworks.







By translating our game to English, we believe more people will come to know and play our game.

<p><strong>Oceanside Community Service, Inc. (OCS) is an all volunteer registered non-profit established in 1949 to aid those in need within the Community of Oceanside, Long Island and assisting surrounding communities.</strong></p>
<p>Oceanside, Long Island and it's surrounding commmunities were ravaged by not only hurricane sandy but a nor'easter a week later as well.  Everything from homes to businesses to cars to schools were flooded, damaged and destroyed.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands lost power in the region and were without power, heat, hot water or garbage pickup.  The damage will in the millions.  See the video above that shows some of the terrible damage to this community.</p>
<p>OCS has already been providing these couragoeus services in the wake of this disaster:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salvaged and transferred 600 cases of sub-zero frozen food from Oceanside High School and transferred to “The INN” (the Interfaith Food Network) which operates 17 soup kitchens and housing for the homeless and battered women and children on Long Island. Oceanside High School lost power for 5+ days and therefore the food would have had to be thrown out. Quick thinking by the Board of Education and the Superintendent of Schools allowed the food to be donated.</li>
<li>Coordinated with High School staff and cooked, packed planned delivery routes, got volunteers to knock on doors as well as get drivers to use precious gas to deliver over 7,000 hot Meals to those who had been subsisting on cold food, no heat, no electricity and storm damaged homes whose damages are indescribable – you have to see the pictures to believe it.</li>
<li>Set up warming station locally outside of FEMA and Governmental control. FEMA and OEM (Nassau County Emergency Management) facilities were not located where those affected could get to once everyone lost their cars and long gas lines kicked in. We recognized this early on and adjusted to circumstances and were able deliver hot food as noted above.</li>
<li>Set up a shopping pantry for residents to come and take  non-perishable food – not MRE”s to sustain families during this crisis.</li>
<li>Set up a clothing boutique for those in need of clothes as well as provided cleaning supplies to help in the cleans up.</li>
<li>Delivered food by bicycle when the gas lines were long and people out of Town needed food to tide them over.</li>

<h3>What Is This Game, Why I Started Making It &amp; What Makes It Special<br/>
</h3> <p>Legends of the Seas is an unique free-to-play multiplayer strategy game that has you up against a friend or a random opponent in a tactical battle of the wits.</p>
<p>My inspiration for this game came from just sitting one day and pondering over the similarities and differences between board- and video games. I have always been a fan of board games that don't have any element of luck attached to them, no dice rolling, no card drawing and no spinning of wheels or anything similar. I mean games like Chess, Checkers, Go and Stratego, games that put you 100% in control of your fate. I came to sad realization that there aren't many video games like that, if any.</p>
<p>So I set out to create a spiritual successor to these games. A game that makes use of the advantages that video games present, while keeping true to the main key elements that made these games so great. The key elements for me are the absence of luck and the near infinite possibilities and strategies.<br/></p>
<p>Here are some main features and goals of this game that I try to focus on:</p> <ul> <li>Equal and fair playing field and game mechanics that minimize the element of luck and make this a truly competitive game.</li> <li>Intuitive simultaneous turn-based gameplay with an awesome planning- and simulation phase.</li> <li>Cross-platform playability. This game is going to be available on PCs, Mac's, iOS and Android devices so you could for example start a game on your Mac against a player on Android and finish it on your iOS device while he finishes it on his PC.</li>
<li>Easy to learn, difficult to master. It is a game that has a simple core concept but the strategies are nearly infinite.</li>
<li>Can be played in a way that suits the player most. Players who want to take their time strategizing can play a slower game where 1 turn can take up to a full day to complete and players who want quick action can choose a game mode where turns can take no longer than a minute or two.<br/>
</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>However, to make this a good and successful game I will need your help:</p> <ul> <li>Your funding helps me put my full focus on this project and keep the multiplayer servers live and depending on the amount of support I will be able to get premium resources(these include but are not limited to software licenses, sound effects, 3D models, textures, UI graphics and music) to make it a truly good looking, high quality game .</li>
<li>The more you contribute, the better I can make the game and the sooner it will be finished. By the game being better I have in mind creating more stages to play on, a larger variety of different ships, improve the graphics of the game, make the UI very neat and easily usable and have a lot of different game-modes.<br/>
</li> <li>For an Indie Developer with very little media reach the first players, supporters  and fans are extremely valuable and I want the supporters to realize that. That is why a lot of the perks have rewards that are exclusive to IndieGoGo supporters that no amount of money can buy after the campaign is over. Also, all of the perks have included with them an amount of in-game currency greater in value than the cost of the perk.<br/>
</li> <li>I am going to finish this game even if I do not reach my set goal, but the development will take longer and the final product will not reach its potential.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The biggest risk for this project is not building up a large enough user-base which is essential for a multiplayer game to function. Also finding a way to keep this a free-to-play game and still be profitable while not making this a pay-to-win game.</p>
<p>To make this game playable even when there aren't a lot of active players I have planned to make the game playable over longer periods of time, where you will be notified when a match is found for you and when the opponent has made his move. That way you can close the app and return to it whenever you find suitable without having to wait for another active player. I will still need to work on making a good match making system, because in a game like this a suitable opponent is what makes the game really enjoyable.<br/></p>
<p>And I have already figured out a great system to make the in-game currency relevant without making it a pay-to-win game. You don't have to worry about that as I don't want this to be a pay-to-win game no more than you do, as that would be going against everything that I created this game for.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't make a donation, then there is still a couple of ways you can help:</p> <ul> <li>Create an account on <a href=""http://kristoeevardigames.com/LotS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LotS website</a> to show that you are interested in the game and you will receive a special early bird reward for having faith in the project once the game is launched.</li> <li>Share this project with your friends!

<h1>Why INDIEGOGO? </h1>
<p>Our
team consists of two people –my friend Maya – the visionary developer and myself,
the game developer. We’ve already poured a lot of resources into this
game for art &amp; design, 2D
objects, audio and other expenses. Indiegogo will allow us to go bigger
and better than we could by going straight to retail. By using crowdfunding, we’ll cover
manufacturing costs and print
for outfits, boost our art budget, bring stretch goals to light, design better and funnier birds, marketing and advertising expenses,
and more. </p>
<p>The
unique thing using Indiegogo is that only people who contribute to our project
by this crowdfunding site will get our fun and cool outfits and even more, some
of you will get the chance to name our main hero and some of the birds!</p>
<p>We
hope to finish this project by mid-September this year and publish Volcano
Birds by the end of September.</p>
<h1>What’s the game inside</h1>
<p>Here, we present some screenshots
of the game still under development:</p>

Volcano
Birds is a free mobile touchscreen game. It is 1-player based, addicting, challenging and fun game. In the birdies’
happy world, the Volcano erupts and all birds are caught by the flames of the
lava. The only one who can save them is you – our main hero, armed with a fire
extinguisher and courage. You can help the birdies fly again.
Volcano
Birds will be survival mode only. Your main goal will be to survive as long as
you can and save as many birds as you can. The more birds you save the higher
score you get.


Why INDIEGOGO? 
Our
team consists of two people –my friend Maya – the visionary developer and myself,
the game developer. We’ve already poured a lot of resources into this
game for art & design, 2D
objects, audio and other expenses. Indiegogo will allow us to go bigger
and better than we could by going straight to retail. By using crowdfunding, we’ll cover
manufacturing costs and print
for outfits, boost our art budget, bring stretch goals to light, design better and funnier birds, marketing and advertising expenses,
and more. 
The
unique thing using Indiegogo is that only people who contribute to our project
by this crowdfunding site will get our fun and cool outfits and even more, some
of you will get the chance to name our main hero and some of the birds!
We
hope to finish this project by mid-September this year and publish Volcano
Birds by the end of September.
What’s the game inside
Here, we present some screenshots
of the game still under development:







Even if you are not able to contribute to our project do not

Have fun!
All the best!

<p>We are the Goblinguild, a miniature club. We are making miniatures for more than two years by now. You can check our works in our Facebook page. We are miniature fans who want to make the miniatures that we want to play with.<br/>After our first campaign of the <strong>Green Ratz</strong> (mutated goblins and skinrats miniatures for Underworld teams) was a success, we want to continue with the <strong>Skull Devils</strong>, a Chaos Pact team. We still need you to speed up the release through crowdfunding. So we bring you our concepts with some of the miniatures already sculpted and if you help to fund it, we will cast them for you. We count with Pedro Ramos to sculpt this team because he is the best sculptor in Fantasy Football scene.</p>
<h3>Risk and challenges. </h3>
<p>We have learned from our first campaign. We know what was more difficult for us and we have taken meassures to better our mistakes, mostly in having delays to ship perks.  We have almost half of the team already sculpted, so we will need less time to complete the team. But our quality standards will mantain, the best takes time. WE WONT RUSH PEDRO. We want the best miniatures possible so he will take as long as he needs. He is a professional sculptor and can work with other projects meanwhile. Take in mind delaying is a possibility but you will have a great team.     </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Mighty Forests of Kalnik is a sandbox survival castle building RTS, placed in an open world, during the trying medieval times. It follows the new standards set by games such as “<i>Rimworld</i>”, “<i>Kenshi</i>”, “<i>Timber and Stone</i>”, “<i>7 Days to Die</i>” and “<i>Factorio</i>” (even though some are played quite differently), ideas and features which show the respect for players’ intelligence. The Mighty Forests story takes place in the deep Kalnik forests. Unexpected events brought your group of 5 people there, and the best course of action for you is to build yourself a sturdy place to live and survive the unexplored wilderness.</p><p> </p><h2>Story</h2><p><i>Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a large and strong kingdom and its two major towns. Or, were those actually two separate kingdoms? I can’t really remember, the records dating back to that age are neither frequent nor very legible. Anyway, between those two towns there are forests of Kalnik, a vast stretch of woods and clearings, hills and plains. No matter how idyllic it may sound, the forest actually conceals a plethora of wonders and dangers, the nature of which is unknown to any civilized soul.</i></p><p><i>Then, as it usually occurs, the people living in the first town had a wish to connect to the other town by a new direct road, and not just by the old and winding one, going for miles and miles all the way around the forests of Kalnik. There had been some minor earlier attempts to build a road, yet they all had failed. However, one day, the King ordered a thousand swordsmen and a thousand archers from each town to protect the road builders.</i></p><p><i>The work lasted for a very long time, and a number of victims were reported on all sides. Nevertheless, the road was eventually completed.</i></p><p><i>As it turned out, travelling through the forests of Kalnik involved many a risk. Some people used to rely on their ability to break into a run in case of necessity, others trusted reliable guards... The only thing that was certain was, that anyone you ran into in the forests of Kalnik did not happen to be there because of their own goodwill, but rather due to a great misfortune and dire necessity. Or greed.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>Many years later, the road was still a bit grassy and in disrepair, yet by no means impassable. There had been no major incident reported in the forests of Kalnik for a while, so the King plucked up courage and decided to send a hundred soldiers to venture way deeper into the forest.</i></p><p><i>That very evening, the soldiers returned. They reported to have heard some eerie sounds and noticed some uncanny commotion, but nothing more blatant than that.</i></p><p><i>The following day, the King dispatched the hundred-strong patrol again. Like on the previous day, they all returned, but this time they did not appear to be so terrified.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>On the third day, they went on patrol, marching steadily. They were never seen again. This is where my story begins.</i></p><p> </p><h2>Three scenarios</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514206219/yak6tpzk2mfx5ngysckh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The King’s unsuccessful venture into the Kalnik Forests was followed by an unexpected series of events which changed lives of three groups of people dramatically, and forced them to start anew in the middle of the forest.</p><p><strong>Gita and the Jesters</strong>: agile skillful people accompanied by a girl named Gita</p><p><strong>Noble Oto</strong>: a nobleman with a firm plan and an attitude</p><p><strong>Shtef and the lost soldiers</strong>: highly trained in military skills, but lost otherwise</p><p>I won’t tell you their full stories just yet (even though the last one is pretty obvious). I want you to read them as you start the game the first time, so they can set the right mood at the right moment.</p><p> </p><h2>Creatures</h2><h3>Settlers</h3><p>You start with 5 + 1 settlers. Your settlers have skills and knowledge how to build, mine, farm, hunt, fight. Their work is assigned via our Tasks engine. You create tasks (dig a hole here, farm there, craft hammers), define which storage to use, choose which settlers are best suited for the task and assign them. The settlers need to eat and sleep. They can die, and ( for the time being ) they cannot get sick. Every now and then, you'll encounter other humans which might be willing to join you. And your clan, if treated right, will grow their numbers up to a few hundred souls.</p><p> </p><h3>+ 1 settler</h3><p>Depending on which of the 3 game scenarios you choose, you'll get one ""different"" settler. Some might say those settlers has some special abilities, I would say that they just have a special kind of view on the Life, the Universe and Everything. But more about that later.</p><p> </p><h3>Animals</h3><p>Animals are using the same task engine as Settlers do. Why? First, it was smarter to code it that way. Second, it allows animals to do things, not just stand around and attack/flee on sight. For instance, Mighty Forests deer can and will sneak in on your fields and eat your crops. There are wolves, bears, deer, rabbits and we plan to add a dozen more.</p><p> </p><h3>Other ""civilized"" creatures</h3><p>You are not the only ""civilized"" creature in the Forest. There are others, and they have their own places to live, they run their own tasks (assigned to them by Clan AI), the same way as your settlers run theirs. They will chop wood, work on farms, mine and build, craft. And maybe they'll be nice to you. Most of the creatures in Kalnik Forests are from Slavic mythology. Some will build their own towns, some will try to steal from you and bring loot to their lair. Some will roam free and react on encountering you, maybe attack on sight, or ask for help.</p><p>There are giants in Forests. And you will be able to build siege engines. A castle- building game without giants and siege engines is not a good castle-building game.</p><p> </p><h2>Clans</h2><p>Your settlers belong to one clan. Every herd of deer or wolves belongs to different clans. The clans have relationship status towards one another, depending on the creature type and past events. So the deer will avoid your settlers and wolves, the wolves will hunt deer, lone settlers and even steal your food in wintertime, or fight another wolves’ clan for game.</p><p> </p><h2>Nights</h2><p>On some peaceful nights your settlers will fall into deep sleep in which they'll suddenly take control over an existing nearby clan (herd of animals, or any other clan). They'll be able to do tasks which those creatures can do. And you can use this new transformation to enjoy the night out, or to help your settlers in some way. You could use one clan of wolves against another, or to scare and drive deer into your bows range. Or use moles to find an iron vein quickly. It's a new feature in RTS gaming (AFAIK), sounds great and should fit into early game boring nights really well. Why look at your settlers sleep, when you can run through the hills as a wolf?</p><p> </p><h2>World</h2><p>The map is endless. In all directions. You can mine and mine and you'll never reach the bottom. You can finally build the tallest tower in the world.

It follows the new standards set by games such as “Rimworld”, “Kenshi”, “Timber and Stone”, “7 Days to Die” and “Factorio” (even though some are played quite differently), ideas and features which show the respect for players’ intelligence. The Mighty Forests story takes place in the deep Kalnik forests. Unexpected events brought your group of 5 people there, and the best course of action for you is to build yourself a sturdy place to live and survive the unexplored wilderness. StoryOnce upon a time, a long time ago, there was a large and strong kingdom and its two major towns. Or, were those actually two separate kingdoms? I can’t really remember, the records dating back to that age are neither frequent nor very legible. Anyway, between those two towns there are forests of Kalnik, a vast stretch of woods and clearings, hills and plains. No matter how idyllic it may sound, the forest actually conceals a plethora of wonders and dangers, the nature of which is unknown to any civilized soul.Then, as it usually occurs, the people living in the first town had a wish to connect to the other town by a new direct road, and not just by the old and winding one, going for miles and miles all the way around the forests of Kalnik. There had been some minor earlier attempts to build a road, yet they all had failed. However, one day, the King ordered a thousand swordsmen and a thousand archers from each town to protect the road builders.The work lasted for a very long time, and a number of victims were reported on all sides. Nevertheless, the road was eventually completed.As it turned out, travelling through the forests of Kalnik involved many a risk. Some people used to rely on their ability to break into a run in case of necessity, others trusted reliable guards... The only thing that was certain was, that anyone you ran into in the forests of Kalnik did not happen to be there because of their own goodwill, but rather due to a great misfortune and dire necessity. Or greed. Many years later, the road was still a bit grassy and in disrepair, yet by no means impassable. There had been no major incident reported in the forests of Kalnik for a while, so the King plucked up courage and decided to send a hundred soldiers to venture way deeper into the forest.That very evening, the soldiers returned. They reported to have heard some eerie sounds and noticed some uncanny commotion, but nothing more blatant than that.The following day, the King dispatched the hundred-strong patrol again. Like on the previous day, they all returned, but this time they did not appear to be so terrified. On the third day, they went on patrol, marching steadily. They were never seen again. This is where my story begins. Three scenariosThe King’s unsuccessful venture into the Kalnik Forests was followed by an unexpected series of events which changed lives of three groups of people dramatically, and forced them to start anew in the middle of the forest.Gita and the Jesters: agile skillful people accompanied by a girl named GitaNoble Oto: a nobleman with a firm plan and an attitudeShtef and the lost soldiers: highly trained in military skills, but lost otherwiseI won’t tell you their full stories just yet (even though the last one is pretty obvious). I want you to read them as you start the game the first time, so they can set the right mood at the right moment. CreaturesSettlersYou start with 5 + 1 settlers. Your settlers have skills and knowledge how to build, mine, farm, hunt, fight. Their work is assigned via our Tasks engine. You create tasks (dig a hole here, farm there, craft hammers), define which storage to use, choose which settlers are best suited for the task and assign them. The settlers need to eat and sleep. They can die, and ( for the time being ) they cannot get sick. Every now and then, you'll encounter other humans which might be willing to join you. And your clan, if treated right, will grow their numbers up to a few hundred souls. + 1 settlerDepending on which of the 3 game scenarios you choose, you'll get one ""different"" settler. Some might say those settlers has some special abilities, I would say that they just have a special kind of view on the Life, the Universe and Everything. But more about that later. AnimalsAnimals are using the same task engine as Settlers do. Why? First, it was smarter to code it that way. Second, it allows animals to do things, not just stand around and attack/flee on sight. For instance, Mighty Forests deer can and will sneak in on your fields and eat your crops. There are wolves, bears, deer, rabbits and we plan to add a dozen more. Other ""civilized"" creaturesYou are not the only ""civilized"" creature in the Forest. There are others, and they have their own places to live, they run their own tasks (assigned to them by Clan AI), the same way as your settlers run theirs. They will chop wood, work on farms, mine and build, craft. And maybe they'll be nice to you. Most of the creatures in Kalnik Forests are from Slavic mythology. Some will build their own towns, some will try to steal from you and bring loot to their lair. Some will roam free and react on encountering you, maybe attack on sight, or ask for help.There are giants in Forests. And you will be able to build siege engines. A castle- building game without giants and siege engines is not a good castle-building game. ClansYour settlers belong to one clan. Every herd of deer or wolves belongs to different clans. The clans have relationship status towards one another, depending on the creature type and past events. So the deer will avoid your settlers and wolves, the wolves will hunt deer, lone settlers and even steal your food in wintertime, or fight another wolves’ clan for game. NightsOn some peaceful nights your settlers will fall into deep sleep in which they'll suddenly take control over an existing nearby clan (herd of animals, or any other clan). They'll be able to do tasks which those creatures can do. And you can use this new transformation to enjoy the night out, or to help your settlers in some way. You could use one clan of wolves against another, or to scare and drive deer into your bows range. Or use moles to find an iron vein quickly. It's a new feature in RTS gaming (AFAIK), sounds great and should fit into early game boring nights really well. Why look at your settlers sleep, when you can run through the hills as a wolf? WorldThe map is endless. In all directions. You can mine and mine and you'll never reach the bottom. You can finally build the tallest tower in the world. Or walls which would shame the Great Wall to tears.Kalnik is a mountain in Europe, covered in mighty forests, full of inspiring nature and history. RoadA road runs through the whole map, generates tunnels if mountains are too high, creates bridges if it runs over a lake. When you connect your settlement to the road, and put out the sign, road venturers might visit your settlement if they find you relevant to their needs and plans. For example, you'll be relevant to passing traders if you do a lot of trading. People in need will more often knock on your doo... hmm.. castle gate if you are famous for helping others.Not building a connection to the road won't spare you occasional visits by friendly bandits who just want your metal, or a trader running from the wolves. It'll just greatly reduce venturers coming from the road, and not all of the Kalnik creatures use roads to travel. Structural integrity (or gravity)To make building castles, villages and even landscapes even more satisfying, we have added gravity. Well, a kind of gravity, we call it a Structural integrity controller.Most importantly, it takes care of those blocks hanging in the air, once it was mined under it or a catapult destroyed some blocks when the projectile hit the wall. Those blocks are going to properly drop to the ground as Newton predicted.Don’t worry, your builders and miners know that and they’ll avoid such mistakes. And, if skilled enough, they will warn you about problems in building plans you are currently drawing.But also it’ll “use the force of gravity” on your buildings if you don’t have enough supporting walls for that glorious ceiling, or if you planned to build the entire castle on one pillar. I know, it’s easier to defend that way, but really...Every building material has a defined clinging force, so building your ceiling using only sand will just make your floors covered in sand and your (low skill) builders confused. BlueprintsDid it ever happen to you that you finish a nice and advanced north city wall, and then you realize you have to do the same thing three more times? Or you keep looking at the beauty of that tower and wishing you can easily build the same one, rotated, in several more places? Well, worry no more, Mighty Forests has blueprints.You can mark any 3D area and create blueprint of whatever blocks are built within. You can rotate the blueprint, mirror (left-right mirror, not upside-down so the roof goes down, but I'm willing to add that feature if you push me). You can share your blueprints between your games AND on the Forums via the in-game menu.Be aware though, I'll look at the best published blueprints and I WILL steal the best designs and show them to the bad guys, and teach them how to build them quickly and use them on your map against you. Tasks engine runs our worldOur Tasks engine is running the show in Mighty Forests.

Each task can have input-specific input storage, output storage, workstation and workers. And each creature can have a sortable list of such tasks. And using a carefully planned UI, setting and reviewing tasks configuration is intuitive and fast.Some tasks are really simple, like “You go here”, but some tasks can have more advanced setup, like “this settler should craft 3 best quality iron swords (since he’s my best smith), he should take iron ingots from the closest storage, work on this lvl 3 smithy and store swords in this armoury once they are done” Skills and researchYou learn and research by workingWe want our armoursmiths to level up their armour-crafting skill while crafting armour.

And they will spread the word about your hospitality and hopefully pay you for the service received. Or become a famous smith and take pride in the best axes for miles around.This won't be included in the first release, as we need to leave something for the future updates ;-).I would prefer to have a ( virtually ) bug-free game ready for Alpha 1 release, rather than trying to cover all the ideas we have. Game’s development stageCodewise, the game is ready for the basic/advanced play. All of the main features are done and tested.

The game delivers the message in an attractive and understandable way and makes the topic entertaining so we believe it has the potential to reach masses and teach them on the topic the way everyone enjoys. 
The video is captured right from the game in its current state. There is some basic gameplay already and the technical aspect is pretty much done. It needs some polishing on the graphical side and some true and fun gameplay.


The Funding
We've been developing for several years, mostly on part-time basis. We've come up with several products, some of them commercial that covers part of the development of our freeware products. 
IndieGoGo campaigning is our first trial to get money for the development another way and if it works well we're ready to stick to this method and develop freeware only products as we believe that digital informations should spread across the web freely. 


Spread The Word
We have some fan base but it's not large. The feedback, however, has been very positive on Monopoly Monster up to date. If you like the concept and the message we'll be more than happy to see you sharing it and spreading the word about the game and the whole matter. Cheers.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Vadrac Studios (væd-ræk) is a newly established game design studio that focuses on creating game projects based on the ideas and workmanship of the college students interested in being a part of its project development teams. The studio is currently based in the city of Mesa, Arizona and is recruiting a lot of its talent from Arizona State University (ASU) Polytechnic, though our current and potential team members are not limited to only that campus.</p>
<p>The studio was founded by Carlos Quinto, a business graduate of Arizona State University now currently enrolled in the university’s Graphic Information Technology major. In addition to being the studio’s founder, Carlos is also the first project director for the studio’s first game project which is currently in development. In addition to Mr. Quinto, the first development team is made up of ten students:</p>
<p><em>Zuzanna Czerny</em> – Character concept artist and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Zuzanna is creating the majority of the concept work for playable and non-playable characters. Her artwork is used by our 3D modelers to create the character models which will be placed into a game. Additionally, Zuzanna's artwork will be featured as the official style for the first project's game-related products.</p>
<p><em>Andrew Johnson</em> – Stage concept artist and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Andrew creates all of the environment concepts and layouts for play progression.</p>
<p><em>Jason Jones</em> – Stage designer and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Jason utilizes vector and raster imaging software to create the environment tiles for the game.</p>
<p><em>Will Richards</em> – Character creator, 3D modeler, animator, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Will utilizes 3D modeling software to mold and render the character models. He also animates the models he creates.</p>
<p><em>Hailee Wilson</em> – Character creator, 3D modeler, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Hailee utilizes 3D modeling software to create character models, props, and various game objects.</p>
<p><em>Charlie Eberspacher</em> – Game asset designer, 2D artist, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Charlie uses vector and raster imaging software to create splash screens, effects, menus, and various images for use in-game.</p>
<p><em>Brandon</em><em> Greene-Hooks</em> – Character designer, font artist, asset designer, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Brandon is a jack-of-all-trades for the team in that he utilizes 3D modeling, vector imaging, and raster imaging software to create various things for the game, from characters to letters. He also assists in digital content creation for our website and online social networks.</p>
<p><em>Jahaira Mancinas</em> – Programmer, stage editor, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Jahaira will be compiling all of the art assets our team creates and place them into the game engine whilst programming all of the necessary functions of gameplay to create the actual playable product.</p>
<p><em>Ryan Duvall</em> – Programmer, stage editor, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Alongside Jahaira, Ryan will also be placing art assets and programming gameplay functions to create the game.</p>
<p><em>Daviel Quinto</em> – Music composer and a student of Glendale Community College. An excellent bassist and guitarist, Daviel will be composing and recording the soundtrack for game projects. Depending on the project, he'll also be recruiting talented musicians to aid in the recording process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The studio also has a few students working behind the scenes on other projects to develop the studio:</p>
<p><em>Artemis Yanez</em> – Web master, digital and print content creator, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Artemis works to develop the studio website and create assets we would use for all of our web spaces. Additionally, Artemis utilizes vector, raster, and print layout software to design various print projects, such as business cards and posters.</p>
<p><em>Dominique Hankins</em> – 3D modeler, assistant web designer, digital content creator, and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Dominique assists Artemis with his various web projects utilizing vector and raster software to create and manage content. Dominique also provides 3D modeling work for both the development team and digital content.</p>
<p><em>Chris Salemi</em> – Administrative assistant and a student of ASU Polytechnic. Chris helps on the the business side of things in assisting Mr. Quinto with project schedules, HR, and crowdfunding campaigns.</p>
<p>This initial campaign will be a way for the studio to pay for the business expenses it incurs for its founding and acquisition of software and supplies. We’re hoping this will be enough to cover what we need and finish the first game project by the end of summer 2013. At the conclusion of the game’s development, there will be actions taken to expand the studio and increase the number of projects to get more student development teams onboard. Within five years time, we’re looking to be financially self-sufficient to the point where we can work on more large-scale projects and have talented students hired on as full-time developers. By then, we’re hoping to be a go-to funnel for those looking to get into the gaming industry.</p>
<h3>Where your money goes: The budget</h3>
<p>For this campaign, the studio will need US $2,000 to cover initial expenses. Here’s an expenses run-down:</p>
<p><img alt=""Expenses for the Campaign"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/v1pEeFc.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Expenses Table""/></p>
<p>Unaccounted costs are possible costs we may incur from any other fees we have not currently incurred, a financial safety net, essentially. Development team support costs is a savings fund we would use to help pay for work amenities and other items to create a productive work space for the development team, such as ergonomic office chairs and keyboards. If this campaign does not manage to reach its initial goal, we’ll be prioritizing covering the expenses we have already incurred or we know will incur before diverting finances to anything else.</p>
<p>While we currently do not have any follow-up goals to reach during this campaign, any funds we obtain which surpass our goal will still go towards development team support. However, should our donations reach or exceed a total of US $12,000, we will take the excess funds to pay for an intern to join as a salaried developer for the current project. We would follow the same procedure for every team member for every US $10,000 over the goal we accumulate.</p>
<h3>Donate and launch our future</h3>
<p>While the studio’s goal is to become a competitive developer in the gaming industry, the focus of building our foundation will come from the talent and ideas of those budding designers looking to get into the industry. While the tools of today have made it easier to develop games, it still takes imagination, time, and dedication to make a great game, and we want to foster the creativity of our students and develop their abilities to start and finish a project and work as a team. This way, our interns come to an understanding of what goes on in the development cycle, gain insight into working on a development team, and be humbled by the hard work that goes into creating a great game. In addition to educational and working experience, student projects are released as buyable products so students receive real commercial feedback on their work.</p>
<p>Supporting us will open up doors for students to work their way into their careers, and you would also support a studio which will focus on setting a precedent of quality in what it takes to create games which surpass the realm of being solely entertainment.</p>
<h3>Spread the word!</h3>
<p>Currently, we’ve set up a Facebook page and a Youtube channel which will document updates on the project’s status. In addition, we’re developing a web page for the studio which will be posted on the campaign’s page after its completion. We’ll also be putting up a game document of the first project for the public to view on the campaign site as well. Exposure is just as valuable to us at this stage as actual donations, so spread the information to whoever you can, whether it be liking us on Facebook, Tweeting about us, or word of mouth amongst the people you know.</p>
<p>Look for us in the future as we plan on starting another campaign towards the end of the year to gain funds to purchase a space we can use as a work studio for all of our future projects.</p></div>","About us: The studio

<p>I'm just
your average Joe, but my name isn't Joe. So I'm just your average *my name*
(sorry my mum taught me not to share my name with strangers). Jokes my name is
Chris.</p>
<p>Here are
the facts.</p>
<p>1. I want
an Xbox one<br/>
2. Having a baby has removed any gaming fund.<br/>
3. My wife has no confidence in YOU! She said there was no way that people I
didn't know would buy me an Xbox one. I’m here to protect you good name/s!<br/>
4. If I raise the funds she has said she will eat a hat. (I don't have a hat at
the moment, so that may become a stretch goal)!</p>
<p>So ye, me
want Xbox one and me don’t have the ££.</p>
<p><b>What's in it for you?</b></p>
<p>Honestly?<br/>
Your mind will be blown with the amazing treats in store for you. From
teaspoons to bespoke poems and even maybe paintings from a baby that isn’t old enough
to crawl yet!<br/><br/>
Let’s be transparent here – I may fail and not reach the target and in that
case what happens with your loving donations!!!!!???<br/>
Well you will still get your amazing gift/s! You won’t lose out!</p>
<p>Now let’s
talk about the target amount. I know it is currently higher than an xbox one.
It is that high because the minimum amount “must be greater than, or equal to,
£500”<br/>
The remaining monies will go to charity! I’ll ask all you guys which charity
you would like out of a shortlist and send the ££ their way. Don’t worry I will
send you all proof that it has been sent- Remember I’m being transparent, like
paper that has soaked up loads of grease. NOM NOM NOM</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>If I reach
the goal, the prize, the dream, etc. I will probably cry. Tears of joy over an
xbox one joining my household, but also tears of joy for an increased faith in humanity.
<br/>
I could also save my tears and rub them on your goodies if you’d like.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>If I lose
to my wife I’ve promised I will eat a shed load of chillies and root ginger.<br/>
This will also make me cry. These tears will not be ones of joy.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

<h2>Background:</h2>
<div>Hey everyone, my name is Carl Bledsoe. I am currently working for a small LAN Center in Illinois and I enjoy my job. I love working with video games, working with gamers, and playing video games. When I was 13, I built a LAN Center building (it also had a movie theater) out of Legos and then that is when I know I wanted to own my own LAN Center (and maybe a movie theater). At the age of 18, I put together a business plan with my friends  for Frag Head Gaming. I was on my way...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Growing up where there was no extra money, building capital for a business start up was impossible. I had no savings or credit. My only real option was to find an investor... and that didn't go so well. By age 20, I gave up on my quest to open a LAN Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, 2 years later I came up with a way to satisfy my need to own a video game related business. It's called Fragged Ya Gaming, and it could be the next greatest thing for the LAN Center industry.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fragged Ya Gaming will be a service that will connect gamers to LAN Centers, LAN Centers to LAN Centers and LAN Centers to events.</div>
<h2>What we do:</h2>
<div>We will host large video gaming events, these events will be exclusive to LAN Centers and their gamers. We will also allow LAN Centers to host their own events that other LAN Centers can attend. We will also help find sponsors as well as sponsor events hosted by LAN Centers. Events include; Tournaments, Leagues, and Showdowns.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will also promote each LAN Center that signs up. Each LAN Center will have its own profile with every team that plays for them. We will also have a Zip Code search so gamers can find their  closest LAN Center.</div>
<h2>Why:</h2>
<div>Its time for a change... LAN Centers have been doing the same thing for years. It's time to connect everyone together. It's time to have more fun doing what we all love.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You might be asking why would we need Fragged Ya Gaming if there is online play... Simple. Everyone plays online, this includes; hackers, cheaters, and people that are just not fun. Fragged Ya Gaming will be played through LAN Centers. We can filter out the hackers, cheaters and hold the LAN Center responsible for their gamers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If a LAN Center or gamer cheats, we can simple ban them. Making the issue go away.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>How will the money be used:</h2>
<p>All funding will be used on our website project. This is a huge project, and I invested everything I had into it thus far.</p>
<h2>Other ways you can help:</h2>
<p>Spread the word!</p>

<li>Bible Chronicles: The Call of Abraham is a single player, third person role playing video game which follows the story of Abraham in the Bible.

Fierce battles, honor and glory, and the destruction of ancient evils await you on your path as you choose how your own story will play out.We hold the Bible completely sacred, and we’ve gone to great lengths to maintain authenticity. For this reason, we formed an advisory team of four pastors and ministry leaders who work with us for the purpose of accurately portraying this amazing story, especially the more controversial aspects of it.  Bible Chronicles: The Call of Abraham is the first Christian video game of its kind: the top-notch graphics are visually-stimulating and the action-packed storylines will keep players engaged. Genesis is full of familiar stories, but they’ve never been told from this perspective. We start out just before Abraham leaves Haran, and because the main character is someone joining Abraham’s caravan, you’re right in the thick of the action.Hundreds of characters,  ancient cities, and hours of engaging sub-plots await in the immersive game world of “The Call of Abraham.” Players will not only be entertained as they build their character and face intriguing challenges, they will also have the opportunity to enrich their knowledge of the history and cultures surrounding Abraham’s famous journey.
Bible Chronicles: The Call of Abraham is a single player, third person role playing video game which follows the story of Abraham in the Bible. The player takes on the role of a fictional Elamite outcast who is hired onto Abraham's caravan before departing Haran.   This character was formerly a soldier of Elam and has skills that are very important for a perilous journey into unknown lands.
Controlling your character and the GUI elements are similar to some of popular MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Lords of the Ring Online.  
In the time of Abraham, much of Canaan had fallen under the controlling of the rising power of Elam to the east. As the player character is an Elamite outcast, this could present complications for the player throughout the game.  

Players will adventure in an open world spanning from Egypt to the eastern parts of Mesopotamia, completing tasks to help Abraham on his journey such as scouting new areas, defending the caravan, trading, and more.
Numerous subplots bring depth and flesh out the historical and cultural context of the story, including the background story of the player character himself. 
We believe that the terrain is one of the largest ever made for an adventure video game.  It would take many days of non-stop exploration to view it entirely if that was all that you did.  
In the Battle of Siddim, Chedorlaomer the King of Elam allied with three other kings to wage battle against five cities of southeastern Canaan. These events bring about an important revelation about the player character's own story.  We’ve spent years researching and planning all of the details – such as which historical Pharaoh we should build our character on (in the end, we decided Senusret I made the most sense) – and we have many of our cast of characters fully developed and almost entirely animated.Our primary focus moving forward is the cinematic work, the completion of the many ancient cities in the game, wrapping up the numerous sub-plots which populate the game world, and then bringing it all together. Phoenix Interactive Studios is located in Bakersfield, California and is led by its two co-founders Martin Bertram and Richard Gaeta.For the last ten years they have owned and operated a successful technology consulting and software development firm called I.T.

<h2><strong>The Plot of Legend of Animana</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The land of Animana is a calm, yet peaceful land. Things were always about talking problems through and solving them quickly. Not all things are what it seems, though! An evil wizard by the name of Nagaim decided to use his evil wizard powers to curse the land! By doing this, he made it to where the land had went to war and learned what it was like. Every single person is now possessed! The main characters are ""immune"" to this curse, as they were visiting another land which was exactly no different than their own. Their own parents, friends, and family are now alive and aggressive. How will the three of them work together to battle the evil wizard Nagaim?!</p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Hi, I'm Anna!</span></p>
<p>Some of you may know me as Gasai Yuno or Anna. Ever since my dream of becoming an English major fell through, I spend most of my time studying game design and writing via watching youtube and Google searching.</p>
<p>As some of you may know  I wish to make an RPG Maker Game inspired by various anime and manga series. </p>
</div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p> We need money from kind old folks like you! Making a game in RPG Maker and hiring game writers, devs, graphic artists, and such can be expensive without donations. All money will go into the game and paying our own staff once their work is completed. </p>
<p>You'll get a free digital DOWNLOAD if this game if you donate $10 or more toward our project today. :) Also, a special THANK YOU in the game credits at the end of the game. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Here's what I can confirm thus far.</p>
<p> - Will be anime inspired graphically (graphics similar to stuff like chrono trigger and such)</p>
<p> - Will use original characters, an original plot, and more - It'll be turn-based combat like in FF3-6' style</p>
<p> - Classes such as mage, warrior, and rouge maybe added.. Or I may make a twist and not have any classes period. </p>
<p> I'll be making a dev blog and possible Facebook page for this game too! Blog is more of a happening as I cannot run more than my own and two friends pages without going insane..</p>
<p>But anyway, if you have suggestions, questions, and the like you're free to post them here. I may even try and find some writers to help with the story, script, and whatever else.</p>
<p>The cost and why I did it at this much is because game artists, writers, and such are high in price and we need a hosting solution that has our game downloads on many mirror sites.  We may, if allowed, use some of these funds to get web hosting to last us for a year or more. </p>
<h2 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h2>
<h3 class=""dotty""><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">If I cannot raise the funds to make the game come true, then I will try and do this project solo and with a few friends. </span></h3>

As you may know all computers have a directory of folders where all the system files are organized pretty much like this:<br/>
                                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/h9cFHTq.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>AdventureOS</strong> takes your folders and the files inside them, to generate a huge castle where the folders become the rooms, staying connected to each other as usual, and the files become the NPCs, decoration, items, enemies etc, depending on their format. Yes, it can be a little difficult to imagine such an innovative concept before actually playing it. Here you have some illustrative examples: <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/p6pt31jmwwys1rq/room%20ej1%20B.png?token_hash=AAHuz6PQAJkW2pOE-2bP3SxLBdY21nf-Ie0Z_e7zhKujmg&amp;dl=1"" src="""" style=""""/> In this example folder you have two .txt files and other two folders. Depending on the name of the current folder you are in, its weight, the number of subfolders inside, and the type of files, all the environment changes generating a unique kind of room in the castle.</p>
<p><br/>
In this particular one the “.txt” turns into a pacific NPC. As mentioned before each extension of the files turns into something different. The other two folders become doors which direct the player to another room generated by this same process when entered.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qohtd3nhp8ucifo/room%20ej2%20B.png?token_hash=AAE3b803Wm97jhjSQIEFQiBclrrTKRISjFxCWHXgXt53Ew&amp;dl=1"" src="""" style=""height: 335px; width: 601px;""/><br/>
In this particular folder we have “.txt”, “.xls” and “.zip” files. Just as before, its content creates a certain environment and again the different files inside of it turn into different objects.<br/>
We have another pacific NPC from a “.txt”, we have snakes from the “.xls” files and a treasure from the “.zip” files. There are no more folders so no doors are created.</p>
<p><br/>
Note that in certain cases (depending on the amount of files with the same extension inside a folder) a few files can merge creating an upgraded version of an item or NPC. ""In"" the example, the big treasure is made out of three “.zip” files and a big snake is created out of three “.xls” files.<br/>
All the platforms and puzzles are created according to the needs of each room and according to the difficulty needed for this section of the castle.</p>
<p><br/>
For better understanding we will explain the game's mechanics, such as difficulty, objectives etc in the next section!<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31195548/gamemechanics.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
The castle is divided in segments, representedos by the depth of the folder in relation to the others. The closest folders to the hard drive will be at level 1. Every new folder inside a previous one will be found at the next level from it.</p>
<p>                                      <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31195548/castillo%20niveles2.jpg"" src="""" style=""height: 345px; width: 245px;""/></p>
<p>To access upper levels you will need to learn special abilities such as double jumps, wall breaking, speed boost, super size and so on.</p>
<p>The game works like a complex Metroidvania where getting to new levels requires exploring previous rooms, fighting enemies and solving puzzles to keep going. Your main goal is to clean all the castle's rooms from the curse casted by the Intruder. To clean a room you must set all the NPCs free by killing the creatures that keep those NPCs inside them. Once you clean a room you don't have to clean it again. But watch out! if you miss one enemy you will have to start over the next time you visit it. </p>
<p><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31195548/ragdoll2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; height: 159px; width: 181px;""/>The skills must be acquired by earning experience inside previous levels. Every explored room gives a little more experience to the character, which will be invested on unlocking the required skills from a skill tree.</p>
<p>Fallen enemies will drop random items depending on the folder level, size, power and drop rate.<br/>
Items such as hoods, swords, books or shields will increase the character's stats and add element modifyers.</p>

<p>Each folder generally counts on a predominant amount of a certain  kind of files, for instance, folders containing music or pictures.</p>
<p>The  type of file, its weight and its name will define the general  environment of the folder as well as its size and the different puzzles  or platforms to be solved in order to access the different areas of the  room.</p>
<p>This way we will find countless possibilities regarding  sizes, distances and platforms depending on the requirements of each  level.</p>
<p>It will be possible to find a long corridor with doors  linking us to new rooms, as well as rooms containing a single small  space where to find a special object for your character or maybe a  reward.</p>
<p>It might be a big hall full of enemies along the different obstacles and platforms, and also a huge room where to fight enemies or even bosses. </p>
<p>There will be as many possibilities as users, and more! Each computer allows a different new world to be created!</p>

<p><strong> - Which platforms will be AdventurOS released on?</strong></p>
<p>        AdventurOS will be released for Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>- How does the game analyze my computer? Is it safe?</strong></p>
<p>        The game will only index a folder when entered, and it only reads the information while being inside it. The game is not going to change any file except the ones inside the game folder.</p>
<p><strong>- How will the funding be spent?</strong></p>
<p>        Since there are three of us in the team making the game (living in different countries) , after taking around 25% for taxes once the campaign gets funded, the rest will be used to pay rent, utilities and equipment such as software and hardware for the development of the game. If we get any extra funding we will add stretch goals to the campaign with more features since we will be able to extend the development process then.</p>
<p><strong>- How and when do I get my perks?</strong></p>
<p>       How: Right after the campaign ends we'll contact all the backers to thank them for their contribution and we will explain any particular case on how to get their perks. When: Usually, and depending on the type of perk, all of them will be delivered in the first and second month from the end of the campaign. This always in the case the project gets successfully funded.</p>
<p><strong>-What happens when some changes are made to the programs, files or directories of my computer?</strong></p>
<p>        The game will index the folder when entered. When some change has been made (only rooms that has been already visited) the player gets a message, something like ""The castle has trembled, it seems like the Architect has made some changes"" then you can visit those rooms again to update the map and clean the new area if needed.</p>

Our first game has been an idea for about 4 years and just a few months ago we managed to raise some cash (about 15 000 dollars) to start developing our dream project – a free multi-platform RPG. <strong>We called it Dromor</strong>. Our friends at TenTouch Ltd help us with the software development of the game.</p>

<p>The main reason you would want to support this project would be because it aims to bring these types of RPGs to the next level. How is this achieved - through changing and enhancing the gameplay itself. The main new things this game has to offer, different from all other games, are the following:</p>
<p>- <strong>Five unique characters.</strong> Every character is unique with its spells, strategies and development. In other games, you chose a character or even customize it, but after that, the game is not much different than what it would have been if you chose another character. In Dromor every character has its own path of development.</p>
<p>- <strong>Fight moves.</strong> Decide what moves and spells you are going to use in battle to defeat your opponent. In most other games the computer decides what you do in battle and its outcome. If the other player has more stuff than you, they win. In Dromor it all depends on you. You choose what skill or spell to enhance and use in battle. See how the battle goes and how to do even better next time. Even if your opponent has better equipment, you can defeat them using your skills and strategies.</p>
<p>- <strong>Great storyline.</strong> Because of the PvP game model, most games of this kind do not focus on the storyline and many of them do not have any story at all. We think the storyline is as important as the game itself, and it is an essential part of the game. This is why we have written an extensive story. As you progress through the game, you will uncover the complete story and then... write it yourself.</p>
<p>- <strong>Diverse quests. </strong>Choose how to complete a quest and what steps to take to reach the goal. Help those in need, defend your kingdom, join sides in battles and slay enemies to take their treasures.</p>
<p>- <strong>Giving back to the players.</strong> Last, but not least, with Dromor we have one main objective:</p>
<p><strong>To create a great gaming experience and balance for all players in the game, regardless of how much money (or none at all) they spend.</strong> Therefore, not only are we determined to make the gameplay and graphics great, but we also made an amazing reward system that will constantly give you ‘diamonds’ (real-money in-game currency) as you play the game and reward you for any goal or level you reach. So the more you play the more ‘diamonds’ you receive <strong>and you don’t have to spend real money to be competitive. You can play totally for free.</strong> On top of that, if you like the game and invite your friends in, we will also give you ‘diamonds’ for free to show our gratitude.</p>

at Twitchy Finger would like to thank all of you supporters for all the 
help and contributions! We couldn't of done it without you guys and it 
has been a tremendous honor!*UPDATE* - JULY 24, 2014IT'S COMING...*Update* - July 11, 2014It's been awhile since we've updated our status for Furball Rampage. Not to keep you out of the loop so here's a quick Friday update. The last two weeks we've been beta testing the game, fixing bugs and balancing the gameplay. We're also adding some additional things that we see fit that can enhance the experience. The game is fully functional now. We hope to get the game out within 2 weeks time for the Android, with the iOS version shortly after that. For those that supported us through Indiegogo, the digital perks will be sent out shortly after the game launches. For those that have physical perks, we are in the process of getting them made and ready. They should be ready to ship in Aug and get to you by then! We're all excited about this and hope you'll be too!*Update* - June 23, 2014Thank-you everyone for supporting our campaign. It's been a tremendously rewarding experience for us. We can't thank everyone enough. We've received a lot of positive feedback during this campaign. As promised, we will release this game within 60 days from now. We couldn't of done this without all your support. We will have the game ready shortly and send out your selected perks within this time frame as well! Those of you with physical perks should receive your perks around August. Those with digital perks will receive it via email.Once again, we at Twitchy Finger Games would like to thank everyone!

As we promised, this game will release within 60 days after the end of this campaign, so we're all working ultra hard. Here's a screenshot of us working on the game's soundtrack and sound effects. Again, please keep supporting us and let's finish this campaign with style! Thank-you everyone for the support! We're at 48% funded right now. We are tremendously grateful for all the help. We've got exactly 1 week left in our campaign.

However, we still got some work to do before then. So please continue to support us! *Update* - June 10, 2014Here we are animating the Kata-Mode characters using Spine software. Our artist first sketches the characters out on Adobe Illustrator, then he separates each characters into parts. Each part is then imported into Spine, reassembled and animated. Once that is done, we export it to Unity 3D which is then integrated into the game. Pretty cool. Check out the animation video below. *Update* - June 6, 2014Getting ready for the weekends again? Here's an update on our progress. We're working on the Kata-Mode of our other characters and have begun animating them. Below is one of the first shots of our Kata-Chip, the aviator goggle wearing friend of Joe. What do you guys think?Also, recently we've got our first press coverage from Cliqist, a preview of our game.

Click on the ""updates"" tab up top! *UPDATE* - May 10, 2014We updated the campaign video with more info about who we are and what our game is about. Please check out the new video above! Furball Rampage is an action side-scrolling running game for iOS & Android. What does a side-scrolling running game have to do with action? Well, unlike most running games out there where you just endlessly jump or duck to avoid obstacles, Furball Rampage adds a unique ""twist"" to the genre by adding an action element into the game. We call this special element, ""Kata-Mode"".Concept art of Joe in various posesConcept art of Judy and her expressionsOur first inspiration for this mode is from playing Katamari Damacy and it is from this where we got the name ""Kata-mode"". For those who played this game, you'll know that as the character collects more and more items, the bigger the ball of items get. You start off small but eventually you'll grow to the size of buildings. We took this concept and applied it to our game.You'll start off with Joe being the size of an average hamster, small and insignificant. As you collect more and more items, you'll be able to transform yourself from a small hamster to a giant monster capable of destroying buildings and wrecking havoc in the city. Kata-Mode ScreenshotsThe second part of our inspiration is from the old-school arcade game Rampage. When you activate your ""Kata-Mode"", you'll turn into a giant monster and have the ability to smash and destroy buildings around you like in Rampage. As the buildings crumbles, you can grab the people that run out from the buildings and eat them. The more people you eat, the more gold you'll ""crap out"". As you progress through this mode, you'll battle army soldiers, helicopters, jets and even unlock special collectibles such as celebrities and sports figures for you to eat when they flee from buildings.     Besides ""Kata-Mode"" we also have bonus stages and alternative paths you can take that breaks free from the usual one-path unchangeable format of the running game genre. There are additional missions for those seeking extra challenge and special rewards for completing them. This unique approach makes Furball Rampage easy to learn and pick up for casual gamers, while at the same time giving it a strategic element for those that want to go beyond casual gaming. Concept art of Kata-Mode Joe
 9 Challenging levels littered with obstacles and hazards to test your skill!
 ""Kata-Mode"" brings unique action element to running game genre!
 Over 30 special missions with unique rewards!
 Over 50 different characters and sidekicks with special abilities!
Tons of hidden collectibles for you to discover!

We believe that if you guys are willing to fund us, we want to get the game out as soon as possible while at the same time meet the quality standards we've set for ourselves. That's why we kept the production time tight and make sure we have realistic attainable goals. We are looking to release the game within 60 days at the end of this campaign, so those of you who have supported us won't have to wait long or keep asking us before you see the results! Your funding will go directly towards our last phase of our development process: game balance, bug fixes, testing it on multiple platforms and if possible, as much additional content as possible before launch. We will be grateful with any contributions you can make!We can't stress enough how much we want to bring this out to everyone as soon as we can. Any questions you have, please feel free to ask us before pledging your donations. We want to make this process as comfortable and as transparent as possible. We know there are lots of games out there looking for funding, so we want let our supporters know exactly what they are funding and where it is going!   AND.... beyond our initial goal, we have other stretch goals that if met, means there's going to be even more cool stuff we can put into the game. The rewards for the stretch goals are even better. Check them out below! Here are some our stretch goals we hope to achieve!What's a crowdfunding campaign without some cool perks?

These can make the difference between an OK-looking game and a great-looking game so definitely worth the extra investment!I will also need to register with Apple to be able to publish on iOS devices and will need to buy a device for testing.  A budget of £600 has been set for iOS publication and the purchase of an iPad.Finally I will need additional game art for items such as pickups and coins and have a budget of £100 for this area.You may have noticed the sums don't add up to the amount I am hoping to raise?!  I am confident I can make a great game and happy to invest some of my own money into this project, but without some help I will need to cut back on some areas (specifically iOS publication and the purchase of Unity Pro).Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to donate but would like to contribute in other ways, I would truly appreciate your help in spreading the word (use the Indiegogo share tools to make things easier).  If your friends love endless runner games, tell them about this game!If you are an artist and can help with the creation of graphical assets for the game, that would be amazing as well.  Anywhere I can cut costs without impacting on quality will mean Road Skill will be a better game for it, as the money saved can be used on adding polish.Thank you for viewing my campaign, and I hope to see you in the alpha and beta programmes!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Are We Doing? (<a href=""http://gamerate.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #ab2d23;"" target=""_blank"">Gamerate.net</a>)</h3>
<p>Gamerate.net is project last 18 months  developed by “one and half man”, that means that whole work on our project was made by just one developer (Me) and one administrator also called as “half man” (<span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">My</span> <span class=""hps"">brother</span></span>, taking care about content, adding games, etc ;).</p>
<p>Official Gamerate.net description:</p>
<p><em>Gamerate is social based database of computer, electronic and board games. Players can track, organize and share their gaming history,  library of bought and finished games, and also rate and review games. Every action is connected with a date, what with number of totally played hours, finished games and spent money creates player’s lifetime history. <a href=""http://gamerate.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #ab2d23;"" target=""_blank"">Gamerate.net</a></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h3>Why we need funding &amp; our story</h3>
<div>Gamerate.net was officially launched after 18 months of preparation in June 2012. In the first year of working on our web page we were students and we didn’t have to care about money and financing. But in last 3/4 months of fulltime working, we realized that our savings are decreasing and life without income is quite difficult ;).</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Come with startup from non-US or non-UK country is more difficult and this is reason why we decided to use IndieGoGo to help with funding Gamerate.net in the first year.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We decided to launch Gamerate even if it wasn’t completely finished, we still have got a lot of features and extensions to implement in our minds. To finish Gamerate to 98% of our plans we would be working at least for next 6 months and ideally for one whole year.</p>
<div>It will take some time until we will be able to finance whole project from advertising revenues. Any contribution and support will help us to work in next months<span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">. We will be able to focus without worries only <span id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">on the</span> <span class=""hps"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en"">implementation of</span> <span class=""hps"">new features and extending the Gamerate.net.</span></span><br/></span></span>
</div>
<div>
<br/>With 6 000$ and additional (small) incomes from <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">advertising </span></span>we should be able ensure work of one “cheap” fulltime developer (Me) and partly working “half man” for next 12 months.</div>

</div></div>","What Are We Doing? (Gamerate.net)
Gamerate.net is project last 18 months  developed by “one and half man”, that means that whole work on our project was made by just one developer (Me) and one administrator also called as “half man” (My brother, taking care about content, adding games, etc ;).
Official Gamerate.net description:
Gamerate is social based database of computer, electronic and board games. Players can track, organize and share their gaming history,  library of bought and finished games, and also rate and review games. Every action is connected with a date, what with number of totally played hours, finished games and spent money creates player’s lifetime history. Gamerate.net
 
Why we need funding & our story
Gamerate.net was officially launched after 18 months of preparation in June 2012. In the first year of working on our web page we were students and we didn’t have to care about money and financing. But in last 3/4 months of fulltime working, we realized that our savings are decreasing and life without income is quite difficult ;).
 
Come with startup from non-US or non-UK country is more difficult and this is reason why we decided to use IndieGoGo to help with funding Gamerate.net in the first year.
 
""Supported us"" ribbon in your gamerate profile (3$ Perk). (See example)
 
What We Need
We decided to launch Gamerate even if it wasn’t completely finished, we still have got a lot of features and extensions to implement in our minds. To finish Gamerate to 98% of our plans we would be working at least for next 6 months and ideally for one whole year.
It will take some time until we will be able to finance whole project from advertising revenues. Any contribution and support will help us to work in next months. We will be able to focus without worries only on the implementation of new features and extending the Gamerate.net.


With 6 000$ and additional (small) incomes from advertising we should be able ensure work of one “cheap” fulltime developer (Me) and partly working “half man” for next 12 months.
6 000 - Fees = 5500$
$5500 / 12 months = 460$ per month + (ads income)
=
300$ + (ads income) / month for full time developer (Me)
160$ + (ads income) / month for part-time administrator

We will add your name or nickname to our supported us. (5$ Perk)
 
Other Ways You Can Help
You can help us, even if you can’t contribute (you probably spent your last money for Diablo 3 ;). You can share information about our project through social networks. You can create your Gamerate account, rate and review some games and invite your friends to follow you at Gamerate.net.
 
Gamerate premium account. (7$ Perk) (See example)
 
Other perks
Game chosen by you (Transport tyccon) as main page game. (10$ Perk)

 
 
Perk 20$+:
Choose your banner for Main page / Category page with approximate dimensions: 468px x 60px

Or
Choose your banner for page with game with approximate dimensions: 728px x 90px

 
(If you choose banner referring to charity or NGO we will double up the  number of displays)
(CPM is 1$ in 20$ perk, 0.75$ in 30$ perk, 0.5$ in 50$ perk, 0.4$ in 100$ perk, 0.36$ in 200$ perk)

<p>Three stories, three outcasts, three nerds… and a single destiny<i>: to make the best video game ever</i>. This is the basic premise of <a href=""https://www.indiecalypse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiecalypse</a>, JanduSoft’s upcoming release, sadly based on actual events.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiecalypse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiecalypse</a> depicts the crude reality of indie game developers and their struggles to get their shit together when it comes to releasing a video game. </p>
<p>Three misfits team up to design and produce their own indie game, finding themselves in a path of <strong>chaos, self-destruction and resentment</strong>. But there’s also space for <strong>crude humor, pop culture</strong> references, gratuitous and non-gratuitous <strong>violence</strong>... and <strong>fear</strong>. Fear of the dozens of lawsuits for copyright infringement, obscenity and profanity we’ll have to face if the game is finally published.</p>
<p>It sounds wonderful, but… <strong>How do I play Indiecalypse?</strong></p>
<p>In Indiecalypse we'll play as Jack Jackson (programming), Ethan Wornick (music) and Violet Oakly (art), and live their own particular stories. <strong>The game's main mechanic is based on modern exploration/adventure games, but Indiecalypse also includes more than 20 mini-games</strong>, most of them copied, sorry, based (let's say inspired by...) some of the most popular games and mechanics in video game history. Check them out below!</p>
<p>Not everything is what it seems in Indiecalypse, and we know for sure that no one will be left indifferent after playing it.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? Help us complete this amazing game and join us on our <strong>epic adventure</strong>.  </p>

Jack Jackson is the programmer, responsible for bringing “THE GAME” to life, and he’s the one who triggers the whole story. An ill-tempered, pretentious douchebag, his hygienic habits are at least questionable, and yet he’ll surely manage to win your hearts.
He’s our main character and the team leader.

Ethan Wortnick is the game’s musician, a talented composer and keytar master. The word “keytar”, by the way, is a blend of the words “keyboard” and “guitar”, in case you didn’t notice. Ethan is a cynical, easy-going fellow with a dubious lifestyle.
He’s Jack’s first ally and eventually becomes the voice of his conscience, or something like that...

Last but not least, there’s Violet Oakly, the team’s lead artist. A former fine art’s A-grade student, a series of unfortunate events molded Violet’s personality into the hysterical leery concept artist she is now. 
She’s the last member to join the team, and becomes Jack’s second right hand. Because it’s always useful to have two right hands.
