<p>The Town Tart is an old fashioned lunch counter and pie shop in Hamden, Connecticut. </p>
<p>Owner, Val McKee, is taking her popular home kitchen pie business to a larger audience and adding more to the menu, but she needs your help! Val is transforming a neighborhood clock shop into a restaurant, which means there is much work to be done. Aside from the usual upgrades to the space, there must be a complete renovation to build a commercial kitchen, restrooms, countertops (you can't have a proper lunch counter without one!), booths (for those who prefer not to sit shoulder to shoulder), coffee and ice cream bar, and much, much more! </p>
<p>Val could have rented a space already equipped with a kitchen, but location was extremely important to her. She wanted to open The Town Tart in a walkable, family friendly neighborhood; a place where people can come on their lunch breaks, children can come after school, and families can come on the weekends. See, Val lives in Spring Glen neighborhood in Hamden, Connecticut. Her three boys attend Spring Glen Elementary. She knew this neighborhood needed a spot like The Town Tart, as it's lacking a cozy lunch spot and place for community to gather. She knew she could provide a place for neighborhood residents and beyond to come and cozy up with the greatest comfort food of all: PIE! </p>
<p>We want all guests of The Town Tart to arrive feeling welcome and comfortable and leave with full, satisfied bellies. We want families to build food memories while sitting at our counter. We want customers to find joy in the modern take on traditional Southern fare, from pimento cheese sandwiches to Val's favorite lemon meringue pie on a gingersnap crust. </p>
<p>We hope you will consider helping Val make this dream a reality! Please consider making a donation to help The Town Tart open its doors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>*The Town Tart will serve lunch from 11:00am-3:00pm. Pie, coffee, and ice cream floats from 10:00am - 8:00pm.*</p>

<p>---About Val---</p>
<p>Val McKee is a native Tennessean who set roots in Connecticut in 2004. She is a writer, musician, and teacher of both, but the joy of her life is being mom to her three sons.<br/>Val has many interests in life, but watching someone take a bite of a pie she has baked tops the fun list.</p>
<p>Her greatest hope is for someone to take a bite of apple pie, twenty years from now, and say something like: ""This reminds me of that pie we had at The Town Tart...remember? When the kids were little and we stopped for lunch after spending the morning at the park."" She wants to help people build the same lovely food memories she made with her grandfather.</p>
<p>Val owes her sweet tooth to her grandfather, who loved coconut cake, always had fig newtons in the cupboard, and had a secret candy drawer in his office. When her mother told him his grandchildren could only have candy once a week, he'd arrive at the door on Saturday morning with a bag full of his favorites. We called it Saturday morning candy. When Val left home for school, her grandfather would write every week and include a single piece of Big Red gum in the envelope.</p>
<p>Her grandfather  was a business owner in her small hometown and Val hopes to make her customers feel even a smidgen of the love he gave to each and every person who walked through his business's doors. She hopes to make every Town Tart customer feel like they are sitting at her dining room table when they take a seat in this new space; whether they dig into a piece of her pie, bite into a sandwich, or take a sip of an artisanal ice cream float.</p>
<p>This shop is inspired by and dedicated to you, Nana.</p>

<p>Alpaca fiber is one of the finest, most luxurious and prized fibers in the world. The fiber is soft, warm, light yet very warm, which makes it one of the most durable fibers. The hollow core of the fiber holds the warmth while at the same time providing freshness in warm temperatures. </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We are Suritayka a women-owned company that sells Alpaca apparel from Bolivia. We are passionate about international development, particularly providing fair opportunities to women and disadvantaged people. We believe that our time in this earth is also to contribute positively to the lives of others. That is why we offer fair opportunities of growth to the entire chain of production of our company. </p>
<p>With your help we will be able to launch our first collection in the US. At the moment we are working with Bolivian providers and artisans on a very small scale, however we got to a point where we need your contribution to take off the ground by making our first sales in the US.</p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p>We need 20,000 to launch a small collection and to have it ready on our website. 10,000 will go to cover the cost of acquiring the yarn.

One of our objectives is to provide opportunities for women to earn income and we want to make it in a way that they stay close to their children at home.

We plan to diminish this risk by maintaining our fair prices, giving respect and equal treatment to everybody we work with. There are other challenges, such as transportation of fiber and final products that can present themselves along the way but we are sure we can overcome any factor that poses a risk to this project.           Other Ways You Can Help Any help is needed, welcomed and appreciated, please spread the word using indiegogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We’ve done a lot of listening regarding upgrades and feature requests for SurveyorConnect over the last 5+ years and there is still a lot to do as many people still don’t know about us yet. From 2010 we started with over 400 users and 5 years later we have almost 5000 users, average over 35,000 unique visitors/month and social media followers in the thousands.  </p><h3>Barely scratching the surface - We need to expand the community</h3><p>We have many plans to further protect and expand the current SurveyorConnect and we know that we are still not reaching everyone that could benefit from our great community. We know that to make SurveyorConnect exist for many years to come we need to stay relevant to all demographics including students, professionals and clients. </p><h3>Past Investments and Looking Forward</h3><p>We invest many hours of dedicated time to moderate, manage, maintain, upgrade and secure the website. This includes moderating posts, responding to email requests, helping new users get signed up, dealing with spam and hacker attacks, etc.</p><p>While we appreciate the generous donations and advertising support we’ve received in the past, it’s not enough to grow the SurveyorConnect community into the future. We have moved forward to address different geographic and demographic user requests, security improvements and technology upgrades in 2015 and now are looking at ways to market to and provide valuable content/services to the surveyor/geospatial worldwide community in 2016 and into the future.  </p><p>Worldwide Vision For The Future</p><p>Our growth far exceeded projections and we also have untapped potential in the surveying and geospatial markets.  The need to adapt - Whether you prefer the terms surveying, geospatial or geomatics professional, the conversations are happening worldwide with or without you. Our goal is to elevate the profession, not divide it.  We’re moving toward a worldwide approach for related geospatial professionals while still strongly supporting the surveying community.</p><h3>ROI: What's In It For Me?</h3><p>We’ve been able to implement most (if not all) of the reasonable features that have been requested by our users over the last 4 years by revamping the forum into a more mature and stable product, using software that was intended to handle larger communities. The new software we implemented with the future in mind, allowing us to grow into a mature, stable product that you can visit comfortably on your computer, tablet or smartphone.</p><p>Currently implemented in 2015:</p><p>Biz Card websites and Surveyor Directory <a href=""http://plat.build/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://plat.build/</a></p><p><a href=""http://surveyorconnect.com/threads/updates-regarding-the-new-website.322092/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Added features/Grid post on SurveyorConnect </a></p><p><a href=""http://plat.build/berntsen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bernsten SurveyorConnect Monument map</a></p><p>Mobile App/Tapatalk (version 1)  - <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quoord.tapatalkpro.activity&amp;hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Android</a> and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapatalk/id307880732?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iOS</a></p><p>Next Steps - Reasons for this round of funding (2016)</p><ol>
<li><p>Content</p></li>
<ol><li><p>We are looking for new ways to bring in more relevant, expanded industry related content while we expand our audience.  We are looking for partners, writers and industry experts to help and it takes time and resources to reach and connect with them</p></li></ol>
<li><p>Requested features/Testing</p></li>
<ol><li><p>Since we are still in the migration/beta testing phase for the new forum for the next two months (July - September 2015) we are evaluating all requests for adding features like nested comments to make your experience what you want it to be and also have many new ways and options to interact.  We are internally planning on rolling out features quarterly in 2016 which may include language support, blogging and other items.</p></li></ol>
<li><p>Global Marketing</p></li>
<ol><li><p>SurveyorConnect has been traditionally strong in the US Market with general emphasis on land and boundary surveying topics. We are actively looking for more ways to market to and connect communities, individuals, associations, technologies, education programs and industries within the larger global communities of geospatial, geo and various types of surveying.  </p></li></ol>
<li><p>Community Education and Support</p></li>
<ol><li><p>As we look for new ways to elevate the surveying and geospatial professions we are very focused around the people that make up these communities and the knowledge that can be shared across borders, professions and generations. We are looking for new ways to engage the communities regarding CEU/PDH courses and day to day FAQ’s as well</p></li></ol>
<li><p>Value Added Features/Services</p></li>
<ol><li><p>We can’t tell you all our plans here but we are looking at some simple value added services that could and should help you save money and even make more money in your business and we hope to start rolling these out toward the end of 2015</p></li></ol>
<li><p>Associations/Conference Support Attendance</p></li>
<ol><li>Even though we have almost 5000 registered users on SurveyorConnect we know that we are just scratching the surface to reach surveyor/geospatial professionals in the US and abroad and we are hoping to expand our reach by travelling to some major industry conferences in the coming years and need funds for travel expenses.  </li></ol>

</div></div>","Happy 5th Birthday SurveyorConnect Community!  June 2010 - June 2015It’s hard to believe that it has been 5 years already since the start of SurveyorConnect.com - The most active discussion forum in the World for surveyors. We’ve done a lot of listening regarding upgrades and feature requests for SurveyorConnect over the last 5+ years and there is still a lot to do as many people still don’t know about us yet. From 2010 we started with over 400 users and 5 years later we have almost 5000 users, average over 35,000 unique visitors/month and social media followers in the thousands.  Barely scratching the surface - We need to expand the communityWe have many plans to further protect and expand the current SurveyorConnect and we know that we are still not reaching everyone that could benefit from our great community. We know that to make SurveyorConnect exist for many years to come we need to stay relevant to all demographics including students, professionals and clients. Past Investments and Looking ForwardWe invest many hours of dedicated time to moderate, manage, maintain, upgrade and secure the website. This includes moderating posts, responding to email requests, helping new users get signed up, dealing with spam and hacker attacks, etc.While we appreciate the generous donations and advertising support we’ve received in the past, it’s not enough to grow the SurveyorConnect community into the future. We have moved forward to address different geographic and demographic user requests, security improvements and technology upgrades in 2015 and now are looking at ways to market to and provide valuable content/services to the surveyor/geospatial worldwide community in 2016 and into the future.  Worldwide Vision For The FutureOur growth far exceeded projections and we also have untapped potential in the surveying and geospatial markets.  The need to adapt - Whether you prefer the terms surveying, geospatial or geomatics professional, the conversations are happening worldwide with or without you. Our goal is to elevate the profession, not divide it.  We’re moving toward a worldwide approach for related geospatial professionals while still strongly supporting the surveying community.ROI: What's In It For Me?We’ve been able to implement most (if not all) of the reasonable features that have been requested by our users over the last 4 years by revamping the forum into a more mature and stable product, using software that was intended to handle larger communities. The new software we implemented with the future in mind, allowing us to grow into a mature, stable product that you can visit comfortably on your computer, tablet or smartphone.Currently implemented in 2015:Biz Card websites and Surveyor Directory http://plat.build/Added features/Grid post on SurveyorConnect Bernsten SurveyorConnect Monument mapMobile App/Tapatalk (version 1)  - Android and iOSNext Steps - Reasons for this round of funding (2016)
Content
We are looking for new ways to bring in more relevant, expanded industry related content while we expand our audience.  We are looking for partners, writers and industry experts to help and it takes time and resources to reach and connect with them
Requested features/Testing
Since we are still in the migration/beta testing phase for the new forum for the next two months (July - September 2015) we are evaluating all requests for adding features like nested comments to make your experience what you want it to be and also have many new ways and options to interact.  We are internally planning on rolling out features quarterly in 2016 which may include language support, blogging and other items.
Global Marketing
SurveyorConnect has been traditionally strong in the US Market with general emphasis on land and boundary surveying topics. We are actively looking for more ways to market to and connect communities, individuals, associations, technologies, education programs and industries within the larger global communities of geospatial, geo and various types of surveying.  
Community Education and Support
As we look for new ways to elevate the surveying and geospatial professions we are very focused around the people that make up these communities and the knowledge that can be shared across borders, professions and generations. We are looking for new ways to engage the communities regarding CEU/PDH courses and day to day FAQ’s as well
Value Added Features/Services
We can’t tell you all our plans here but we are looking at some simple value added services that could and should help you save money and even make more money in your business and we hope to start rolling these out toward the end of 2015
Associations/Conference Support Attendance
Even though we have almost 5000 registered users on SurveyorConnect we know that we are just scratching the surface to reach surveyor/geospatial professionals in the US and abroad and we are hoping to expand our reach by travelling to some major industry conferences in the coming years and need funds for travel expenses.

<p>Craft beer revolution has reached the Western Balkans finally! Former homebrewers start new craft breweries throughout the countries of former Yugoslavia. Numerous gatherings of homebrewers and craft beer festivals take place frequently, joining many young people and destroying the boundaries placed by politics and war past and building new bridges of friendship and cooperation between nations.</p>
<p>Visits to several craft breweries in Croatia (Zmajska and Medvedgrad) and Serbia (Kabinet and Crow) gave me strong motivation and I finally decided to turn my hobby into something more serious and exciting - to open Highlander Craft Brewery at my late grandfather's farm in the village of Jakupovci, 16km from Banja Luka.  </p>
<h3>What is craft beer?</h3>
<p>Craft beer is made of all natural ingredients, without the addition of preservatives or artificial adjuncts. It is usually made by homebrewers and small local craft breweries. It comes in various styles and some of the most popular include American Pale Ale, India Pale Ale, Belgian Blond Ale, German Weizen, Amber Ale, Porter, and Stout. Craft beer is most often unpasteurized and unfiltered. Its high nutritive value and positive effects on health combine with the diversity of flavors and aromas, making it a true joy. </p>
<p>In the brewery, I will be making several styles of beer like American Pale Ale, Blonde Ale, Brown Ale, Stout, Weizen, Abbey Ale and Gruit - a specialty ale with aromatic and medicinal herbs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468169254/cqk5fk3mgb6dffak82to.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why the countryside?</h3>
<p>In the post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, youth unemployment is over 60% (the highest in Europe), meaning that many young people cannot afford to start a family or travel and meet other people and areas of the world, and they rely on their parents even at the age of 30+.  At the same time, villages are being abandoned and many young people go to cities to look for jobs, but job offer is scarce. When faced with many disappointments, they finally leave the country. </p>
<p>I wish to give an example to all young people that our countryside offers plenty of opportunity for having a happy and fulfilled life. I wish that my 12-year-old nephew living at the farm stays there and starts his own family someday, just like his friends. It is only through the development of the local economy that this and other villages can survive. And we must remember, it is the villages and farms that kept us going during hard times.   </p>

<h3>Why do I think I can do it?</h3>

Also, at this moment, more than a hundred individuals from my surroundings have tried some of my beers and would like to have them available in their favorite bars and retail sale. My biggest support comes from my girlfriend Nina, who is helping me organize all campaign activities.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">The Problem We Are Trying to Solve</h3>
<p></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Indian Education Sector is a $25 Billion Industry. 40% of India is below the age of 18. But even after such great potential, only 25% of Graduates in India are considered employable (Nasscom-McKinsey Report). Even after 16 years of rigorous education, graduates need to be trained from the very basic in Industrial skills. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Moreover, students here do not get to choose their own career paths. Most of the knowledge imparted is theoretical and students are forced to cram and learn by rote.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">There are 23 million eligible kids in India for education (Data for 2004), 83% of whom reach Grade 3 and only 34% reach grade 10 while just 2.3 million (10%) become graduates. <b>13 million kids drop out between grade 1 and grade 10! </b>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Half of this dropout numbers is due to distinct lack of interest in education and non-visible goals for a good future (which usually requires 15 years of rigorous education to achieve).</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><b>So we thought of introducing our flagship product - Gyan Labs (practical learning and value-added experimenting labs) at low resource government as well as private school and provide this facility absolutely FREE of COST. Gyan Labs has been tested and is proven to attract the attention of students through a model that provides hem with learning and fun components at the same time.</b></div>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Our Story - About ADD-on-GYAN Educational Services (AOGES)</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hi, I am Priyadeep, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director of AOGES. And here is our story - AOGES's journey.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Based on the problems mentioned above we started AOGES with the aim to reduce the problems in the educational sector in India, to EMPOWER the students in India and to make them independent and choose their own career options. We began operations in January, 2011 to establish Gyan Labs for students of grades 6 - 9. We set out by establishing our Pilot Model of Gyan Labs at a school in Manipal, Karnataka (India) in June, 2011. In this lab, we provide students with the physical apparatus to conduct experiments along with a very specific user manual made to suit their level of understanding. We aim to provide 12 - 30 kits to a school based on the number of classes we conduct in a month which could be 1, 2 or 4 classes per month. So this is our basic operation. We are running our first Gyan Lab well and will bootstrap our resources into establishing more labs for other schools across India.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>But, at present we wish to set up Community Gyan Labs for underprivileged schools in India as well but do not have the necessary monetary resources to implement the same.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Hence, we came to IndieGoGo looking for assistance in setting up the these community Gyan Labs.   </b></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you choose to help us and we reach the target funds to be raised, we would be able to provide the GYAN LABS to around 1000 underprivileged school students and help them shape a better future for themselves. It would be a lifetime opportunity for these kids as they would never dream of getting such a facility for themselves. We would go to any end to see this happen even if we are unable to raise the funds here but the only problem would be that these labs would have to be postponed until the company is well off and is able to pay for and manage Community Gyan Labs which could take as long as 3 years from now. </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Chris VanDusen and my dream since I was a kid is to own a bike shop. My love for bicycles started when I learned to ride one at age four. I was fascinated by how these human powered machines worked and began fixing my own bike when I was about eight years old. I was fortunate to get a job at the local bike shop as a mechanic at sixteen years old and worked my way up to manager by my early twenties. From there, I worked as both a tour guide, tour developer, and office manager for the bicycle touring company <a href=""http://classicadventures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Classic Adventures"">Classic Adventures</a>.

Many of you know and love my friend Brad. And many of you know he suffered a
stroke in November.


After some time in the hospital and in rehabilitation, Brad will be
returning to his home this week. His family is down in Florida (from Kentucky)
helping out while he recovers. (I might add that his recovery has been
miraculous. Go Brad!)


If you're like me, my first impulse is to bring a casserole to my friends and 
neighbors in times like these. Cooking and preparing meals takes a lot of time, so that's why the 
gift of food is actually the gift of time spent with loved ones. We may not be as close in proximity as in 
times past, but there's no reason why we can't still help out.

Let's raise
money to get dinner to his home for a few weeks while Brad's family is in Panama City helping
out.  A week of meals for four is $137 from Spice of Life in Panama City
(http://spiceoflifepc.com). Can you help me raise money for four weeks of
meals to help out during this transition? Any little bit would be greatly
appreciated.




Bless you and yours this holiday season!


What We Need & What You Get
We need a little cash to give Brad's family meal delivery for the next 4 weeks. You get the pleasure of knowing you helped out from far away.

Any money raised beyond our original goal will be given to the Morris family for whatever they need (Art supplies for Brad? Therapy copays? More meals? Whatever they need...)

<p>I see a need for professional, high quality, trustworthy pet services.  My name is Olga and ever since I was a little girl I have been connected to animals –adopting stray dogs and cats, caring for sick and injured animals, and truly appreciating the wonderful experience of connecting one on one with animals and learning from their wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Caring for Your Animals as if They Were My Own</strong></p>
<p>I know this work is a great fit for my passion and skills. Like any smart entrepreneur I already know I like this work and am good at it!   I have been working as a contract pet sitter and am ready to launch and grow my own business.</p>
<p>I don't want others to go through the same frightening experience I had a couple of years ago. I hired a vet tech to provide overnight care for my dogs and cats.  I had a gut feeling that she wasn’t delivering the care I was paying her to provide.  I enlisted my neighbor, who retired from the FBI, in some detective work while I was out of town.  He reported that the pet sitter drove up to the house in the evening and went inside and then left 15 minutes later, not to return until morning for another short visit.  My gut was right; the pet sitter was lying to me and not staying overnight as she was hired to do.  Since I was concerned about my animals, I immediately hopped in the car and drove seven hours home. </p>
<p>I’m starting a professional pet care business because I love animals, I’m trustworthy and I provide high quality services.   In addition to providing superb pet care, I am also focused on excellent customer service.  My clients feel secure when I care for their pets; they know I am dependable and some might even say I’m hyper-vigilant about watching over their companion animals (they love this oh-so-relevant characteristic of mine).</p>
<p>I will provide high quality services including daily dog walking, overnight care, daytime visits, and puppy training and visits.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>In order to successfully launch my professional pet care business and be ready to provide services during the high demand end of year holiday season I need to get some key business components in place now.  Your support will allow me to:</p>
<p>1. Join Pet Sitters International – and gain access to the industry’s largest array of services.</p>
<p>2.  Purchase an Insurance Policy designed specifically for professional pet sitters.</p>
<p>3.  Develop marketing materials including a logo, website, brochure and business cards.</p>
<p>If I exceed my funding goal then additional funds will be directed toward setting up core business operations with a laptop, pet scheduling software and smart phone to be able to access schedule, email, and client contacts all while working in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>In additional to any financial support you can provide (gifts of all sizes are greatly appreciated!) please help by telling your friends and family about my funding efforts.  Please forward this link to your friends and post it on your Facebook page.  If you or someone you know can provide quality pro bono marketing design support, then please contact me ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>Thank You Thank You Thank You</strong></p>
<p>Every contribution is greatly appreciated. Knowing I have your support provides me with even more fuel and energy to launch my new business.  Thanks so much. </p>

<h3>Mother Jones Food Pantry</h3>
<p>Mother Jones Food Pantry delivers meals to folks in the community who need it.  They had saved for 10 years for a large delivery truck (17' used Ryder/UHaul-type), and, after having it for all of 10 days (and before insuring it), a thief made off with it last Monday.  </p>
<h3>What the Money Is Being Raised For</h3>
<p>After a quick look around the internet, it appears that used 17' box trucks are being sold for around $5500.  I figured, with sales tax, registration, processing fees, and the like, that $7000 should cover the cost of a replacement.  Any little bit counts.  See the story here:  <a href=""http://chicagoist.com/2012/06/21/today_in_awful_thieves_steal_food_p.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://chicagoist.com/2012/06/21/today_in_awful...</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I saw the success of some other charitable ventures (Karen the Bus Monitor) and thought I'd give it a shot.    </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although Mother Jones continues to operate as it has before it had the truck (using the personal vehicles of the volunteers), the need for the larger delivery truck is growing as the economic conditions in the greater Chicago area remain bleak for many residents.  Even if we don't get enough here to buy a new truck, whatever money is gathered will go to Mother Jones to aid them in providing their essential service to the community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you don't have money to give that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live in the area, give your time to support the organizations helping those in the Chicago area in need.  </li>
<li>Tell your friends about this.  It is a truly tragic situation; maybe they'd be willing to give a few dollars to help get Mother Jones another truck.</li>

<p>Child Trafficking, specifically Child Sex Trafficking, is an epidemic that society has little to no real understanding of. This is a HUGE multibillion dollar business that uses a wide variety of techniques ranging from clever seduction to the MOST inhumane forms of torture imaginable, all with a common goal - to ENSLAVE their victims; often by simply providing the fundamental needs of the child - food, shelter and a very distorted sense of love and security. There is absolutely no doubt that these children, who have been tortured both physically and mentally, are VICTIMS in need of serious help and proper care.</p>
<p>Despite this urgent NEED, these children, more often than not, are treated as criminals and are subjected to prison time rather than rehabilitation and restoration. To make matters worse there are only around a SHOCKING one hundred beds available for these children in America, resulting in a massive shortage, and thus adding to the problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that this is not a ""foreign problem"" contrary to popular belief.

Throughout this project, we heard many stories of<br/>how food allergies affected people physically, socially, and mentally, including<br/>how children have cried because they could not eat the provided food due to<br/>a nut allergy and how a woman was too afraid to use an epinephrine injector<br/>on her friend even though he was going into anaphylaxis. These stories made<br/>us realize how terrifying food allergies are and how it is a fear that people<br/>should not have to live with.<br/><br/>My partner, Maria, was already aware of the dangers of food allergies, being a<br/>mom who has to take every precaution with what her daughter eats because<br/>she has several food allergies. However, in the Summer of 2011, Maria's 4<br/>year old daughter ingested a food normally thought to be safe, that happened<br/>to have a cashew puree ingredient. Her daughter spent 3 days in the pediatric<br/>ICU. Despite all of the work she had done with Erin on this subject, and fully<br/>aware of the importance of administering an Epipen immediately, she was<br/>still too afraid to inject her daughter. Instead, she took the risk of getting her<br/>daughter to the emergency room on time.<br/><br/><strong>OUR GOAL:</strong><br/>After spending a year developing these products, we have received many<br/>email messages from people, sharing their troubling stories with us and<br/>desiring a better solution for themselves, family, and friends. Having an<br/>allergic reaction can happen at anytime and anywhere, so our goal is<br/>to give people a peace of mind that regardless of where they are, they<br/>will be confident that the epinephrine needed to treat anaphylaxis is not<br/>only available to them, but that they can intuitively, confidently and easily<br/>administer it. We plan on achieving this goal with our two injectors that will<br/>together cover both public and private locations.<br/><br/><strong>PRODUCT DETAILS:</strong><br/>Epi Inject is a new type of treatment delivery system for people who have food<br/>allergies and received the Spark International Concept Design Award.<br/><br/>The Epipen, one of the only treatments currently available for allergic<br/>reactions, has proven to save lives by administering the epinephrine that<br/>will reverse the symptoms of an allergy attack. Because death can happen<br/>in 10 minutes, epinephrine gives the person enough time to wait for the<br/>paradmedics to arrive.

<h2>The Terrazas Community Kitchen Project</h2>
<p>My name is Lynda Haliburton; I am participating in a 6 month program at Santa Clara University, through the Leavey School of Business.  The program, Women Leaders for the World, is part of the Global Women Leaders Network that provides training to women in the areas of leadership, networking principles and strategies.</p>
<p>I currently work for City Team International as a Teaching Assistant. While on vacation in 2010, I went on a mission’s trip to Terrazas, a colony in Tijuana, Mexico. My life was impacted by what I saw: people living on hillsides in cardboard and tin housing with no running water or electricity, and children who had never owned a new toy or eaten a hamburger. The “kitchen” that serves the community is currently a concrete platform, that’s it!  The community leaders brought equipment such as bar b q pits, tables, bottled water to wash serving hands, and utensils from other areas to cook and serve meals to hungry families then pack up everything after the people were fed. </p>
<p>Since then, helping the community of Terrazas complete the kitchen has been one of my goals. With business and community leaders' support, we’ve procured an industrial oven, 200 brand new chairs and leadership training for men, women and children.  Your support will help develop this community kitchen. The site will be used for multiple purposes: free meals, trainings and classes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your support to reach our goal to raise $9, 200 to purchase items such as support beams, flooring, sheet rock, windows, electrical and plumbing supplies, tools, materials for the roof and labor. ALL FUNDS donated whether large or small will be used to complete the kitchen.</p>
<p>To show our appreciation, we have created a few perks for your generosity:</p>
<p>$5 – A personal thank you note.</p>
<p>$10 – A Power of One wristband and shout-out on our Facebook page.</p>
<p>$25 – A personal thank letter with a photo of the community and a shout-out on our Facebook page.</p>
<p>$35 – A gift certificate to the DevineGrind Coffee House in San Jose, Ca.</p>
<p>$50 – A gift certificate to the House of Soul Food in San Jose, Ca.</p>
<p>$100 – Your name will be placed on a quilt block on the Terrazas Community Quilt.</p>
<p>$500 – You are invited to come with us on our next trip to Terrazas and meet the people and see the kitchen site.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are teaching people how to fish not just giving them a handout.  The kitchen will<br/>serve as a focal point in the community to provide food for hungry families and<br/>provide a space for trainings in social and economical development.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>

My name is Lynda Haliburton; I am participating in a 6 month program at Santa Clara University, through the Leavey School of Business.  The program, Women Leaders for the World, is part of the Global Women Leaders Network that provides training to women in the areas of leadership, networking principles and strategies.
I currently work for City Team International as a Teaching Assistant. While on vacation in 2010, I went on a mission’s trip to Terrazas, a colony in Tijuana, Mexico. My life was impacted by what I saw: people living on hillsides in cardboard and tin housing with no running water or electricity, and children who had never owned a new toy or eaten a hamburger. The “kitchen” that serves the community is currently a concrete platform, that’s it!  The community leaders brought equipment such as bar b q pits, tables, bottled water to wash serving hands, and utensils from other areas to cook and serve meals to hungry families then pack up everything after the people were fed. 
Since then, helping the community of Terrazas complete the kitchen has been one of my goals. With business and community leaders' support, we’ve procured an industrial oven, 200 brand new chairs and leadership training for men, women and children.  Your support will help develop this community kitchen. The site will be used for multiple purposes: free meals, trainings and classes.


What We Need & What You Get
We need your support to reach our goal to raise $9, 200 to purchase items such as support beams, flooring, sheet rock, windows, electrical and plumbing supplies, tools, materials for the roof and labor. ALL FUNDS donated whether large or small will be used to complete the kitchen.
To show our appreciation, we have created a few perks for your generosity:
$5 – A personal thank you note.
$10 – A Power of One wristband and shout-out on our Facebook page.
$25 – A personal thank letter with a photo of the community and a shout-out on our Facebook page.
$35 – A gift certificate to the DevineGrind Coffee House in San Jose, Ca.
$50 – A gift certificate to the House of Soul Food in San Jose, Ca.
$100 – Your name will be placed on a quilt block on the Terrazas Community Quilt.
$500 – You are invited to come with us on our next trip to Terrazas and meet the people and see the kitchen site.  


The Impact
We are teaching people how to fish not just giving them a handout.  The kitchen willserve as a focal point in the community to provide food for hungry families andprovide a space for trainings in social and economical development.

<p>My name is Jon and my older brother, Kenny Bass is a disabled Marine combat veteran from the Iraq War. He served with the Marine infantry for the first 8 months of the war.  He was wounded during a counter-ambush patrol, he was hit with an IED, and has suffered PTSD and multiple other physical injuries due to his combat service since 2004. He was diagnosed with Behcets Disease in 2007 that has been linked to his anthrax and smallpox vaccinations. The Behcets disease causes him to suffer severe arthritic joint pain, chronic fatigue, neuropathy, painful sores, and multiple other debilitating symptoms. </p>

<p>He has spent the last 8 years of his life in treatment for his PTSD, and now is in need of a PTSD service dog that will enable him to leave his house again and begin rebuilding his life outside of his home.</p>
<p><span style=""color: red;""><strong>PROGRESS</strong></span><br/>Kenny has been working with Mike Hale, Marine Vietnam Veteran, and owner of Instinctive Guardians in New York [ <a href=""http://www.instinctiveguardians.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.com</a> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/instinctiveguardians"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> ]. Yesterday Kenny received the contract and was able to speak with Mike to nail down the specific costs involved, and timeline for the specialized training.   The costs will include traveling to Instinctive Guardians in New York to meet the trainer, Mike, be introduced to the available dogs and ultimately choose one that will then go to San Diego for further specialized training.  Prior to the completion of the BH training in San Diego, Kenny will travel there to meet with Mike Hale, and Mark Viera of Von Viera Shepards for training and the graduation ceremonies.  Upon completion of BH training, the service dog will then return to Instinctive Guardians in New York for the training specific to Kenny's specific PTSD related needs.  Then Kenny will travel to Instinctive Guardians to complete the final service dog team training, to include the American Red Cross' certification in Pet First Aid and CPR,  becoming a certified service dog team, and officially take ownership of the service dog. Now Kenny can return home, begin rebuilding his life, and start the recovery process. </p>
<p>The service dogs available through Instinctive Guardians are West German Shepards with championship blood lines.  Presently, the four available service dogs at Instinctive Guardians are the grandchildren of Odin Vom Holtkamper Hof, and Hill Vom Ferbenspiel.  The grandfather, Odin, is the 2005 18-24 month Sieger VA1, 2008 VA2, and the 2008 Chinese Sieger VA1.  The grndmother, Hill, is the 2004 Sieger VA2.  These German Shepards not only receive the (CGC) Canine Good Citizen training, but also the (AD) Assistance Dog training, the (BH) Begleithund training (Traffic Steady Companion Dog), as well undergoing obedience testing by an impartial german judge and being graded accordingly.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>These psychological service dogs spend years in training and are very expensive. Withouit raising these funds it would be impossible for my brother to pay for a properly trained service dog on his own.  Once he is paired with a psychological service dog, he will be able retrain himself to live a functional life in a civilian setting (through the aid of a service dog) and learn to lead more of a normal life again, not only for himself but for his wife and two young children.  The service dog would assist in bringing him out of flashbacks and help keep him grounded in reality, the dog would wake him when he is having nightmares, And it would especially help him when he is in public(he tends to get overwhelmed and angry), the dog would assist in creating a buffer around him in crowds, and allow him to feel more secure. A service dog will give my brother and his family their lives back. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Uplifting, LLC will be a specialty bra store lifting cups D through N.  Related products such as underwear, active wear, lingerie, and lingerie care products will be sold as well. The purpose of Uplifting is to provide women with large busts in the Houston area with a greater variety of quality bras and intimate apparel. Uplifting will eliminate the common act of ‘settling’ for a bra, and replace it with the act of ‘falling in love’ with a bra. An “uplifting experience” will allow customers’ hidden, and sometimes forgotten, inner beauty and confidence to resurface.</p>
<p>My mission is to provide quality bras and service to women with large bust sizes; assuring women that they are wearing their correct bra sizes, aware of which bra styles offer their personal comfort and support preferences, and always have an uplifting experience that yields uplifting confidence.</p>

<div>George, 34 years, is a tour guide operator with more than 10 years of immense experience in the tourism industry and has been rated as one of the best guides in Namibia on TripAdvisor. Jenny Shipley, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand was one of George's 'clients' and he was her guide for the filming of Intrepid Journeys.

</div></div>","Summary At Walt Disney Animation Studios, making movies isn't always all magic and fairy dust.  Production can be an uphill challenge with demanding deadlines - our latest film, ""Big Hero 6"", is no exception.  
Like any other job, during crunch, person hygiene can become a lower priority.  In the case of Steve and Shant - they have taken it to a new extreme.    Why We Need Your Help Steve and Shant have come to enjoy their overgrown mane, but fail to realize their culmination of big hair has become a distraction and challenge to everyday activity. 
With the completion of ""Big Hero 6"", Steve and Shant have grown overly comfortable avoiding hair cuts and beard trims, and we need your help to relieve them of this burden and groom them back in shape. 
What We Plan To Do About It


Steve and Shant have agreed to cut their hair, if our fundraising goal is met by the time ""Big Hero 6"" opens in theaters November 7, 2014 (fundraising ends November 5).
Each contributor enters for the opportunity to design the hairdo which Steve and Shant will wear for a day (to be announced November 6).
The Benefit

have a place of our own. After discovering we had a similar vision for opening

<p>In March 2014 Sarah and Matt celebrated their

Washington, returning more inspired and motivated than ever to move our brewing
vision forward. The very day we got back we received an unexpected follow up

episode, now available for your viewing enjoyment. We were thrilled to be able to share our beers and hear such positive feedback
from Martin, James and crew, as well as the sculptors trying them who didn’t realize at the time that we were outside listening. In a city that they referred to as the homebrew capital of the world, we're proud that they considered our beers amongst their favorites. </p>

10bbl brewhouse we’re installing, plus still have plenty of room leftover for our planned barrel
aging projects and of course a large tasting room. The city of Palmdale has
been completely encouraging and helpful throughout the entire process and we
are thrilled to be their very first brewery. </p>

Granny lost it all. The home and all her belongings burnt and tossed in the
dumpster. What was saved was the computer and Granny being of the techie type
she had just recently transferred all her photos on to her computer's hard drive. We were
able to save that. She still has her pictures and no one was hurt. Today she
and Lillie spend their time telling old stories and cooking up some of the best
chicken and dumplings you have ever had. Personally I am fond of the pound cake

of your Granny and how she would feel if you were able to save her house so

And few organizations are able to build both of these things with such success and heart as Habitat for Humanity. </p>
<p>From September 20-28, Christa and Jess are thrilled to be heading to El Salvador as a Habitat for Humanity Global Volunteer - ready to support this amazing organization in a hands-on way (and feeling extremely grateful to have the experience of traveling to a new country as well).</p>
<p>Along with 10 other volunteers through Habitat for Humanity Portland/Metro East, we will help to build homes for families who otherwise may not be able to afford decent and affordable shelter. We'll be building earthquake-resistant houses in all stages of construction, from digging foundations to painting the houses.  We will be in the Sonsonate area, a highly agricultural region in the western part of the country. There, we will work with the families and community directly to construct these homes.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/></b></p>
</div><div> <p>We're asking for $1000 through this campaign. This money will help us to cover our program costs, which go directly to building materials and other miscellaneous costs associated with the team's trip. Thank you for your support and love!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Although El Salvador is one of the smallest countries in Central America, it has one of the highest population densities. One in three people do not have adequate housing in El Salvador. Natural disasters such as earthquakes have damaged infrastructure and homes throughout the country.</p>
<p>This year, Habitat for Humanity El Salvador has already served 996 families.  Since 1992, Habitat for Humanity El Salvador has provided more than 10,300 housing solutions, providing simple, decent and affordable shelter for more than 51,500 Salvadorians. Habitat El Salvador works with the central office in San Salvador and seven regional offices.</p>
<p>Habitat for Humanity focuses on empowering families as they participate in the process. Families contribute directly to the construction of their homes and other homes in their community through ""sweat equity."" They also have a home loan they pay back in affordable payments  to Habitat for Humanity - which then goes back to the organization to continue building more homes.  Habitat for Humanity El Salvador also provides financial education and community development programs for participating communities.</p>
<p>Earthquake-resistant homes are made of concrete blocks and structural steel reinforcement. The roofs are made of fiber-cement sheeting, and the floors of cement brick. They have two bedrooms, a living room, a dining room and a latrine or toilet. </p>
<p>Global Village volunteers may work in all stages of construction, from digging foundations to painting the houses. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>This is an established organization, with an established international volunteer program. Still, any project runs the risk of unexpected costs and challenges to plans in place. Your donation will help support the project and whatever may come along as we build.</div>
<ul></ul>

<p><i>Thousands of children and adolescents in Italy and around the world can’t
walk because they have an illness or injury to their central nervous system due
to a congenital or acquired disorder such as cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury,
stroke, brain tumour, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular disorder.</i></p>
<p><i>
When children are afflicted with one of these disorders or injuries, it is
necessary to start a rehabilitation program to help them walk again.</i></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h2><b>WHO WE
ARE.</b></h2>
<p>We are a team of researchers at the <b>Laboratory
of Movement Analysis and Robotics (MarLab)
at the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù, </b>and for years we have
been committed to caring for newborns, infants and adolescents that have a brain
or spinal injury. We are actively involved in developing research initiatives
that adapt existing technologies in use for adults to the needs of children. If
this is not possible, we look for completely new solutions. <b>We have developed
high-tech robotic systems for the rehabilitation and recovery of motor
functions in children with brain and/or spinal cord disorders. </b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>WHAT WE’D
LIKE TO DO.</b></h2>
<p>We want to develop a new <b>exoskeleton</b>
<b>for hips and pelvis</b> to help these
kids to walk again.</p>
<p><b>An exoskeleton is a robot</b> that supports movement and is characterised by
sensors and a computerised control system that young patients can “wear” to
help them recover their motor functions.</p>
<p><b>We want to design a device that has never been
developed in Italy or the world before and goes beyond existing systems </b>inasmuch as: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>It can
     be used for all children under the age of two</b></li>
<li><b>The
     orthosis can be custom fit and adapted in order to recover motor functions
     that are currently difficult to attain because existing robots must be
     substituted as the child grows. This will reduce gait rehabilitation
     times.</b></li>
<li><b>Patients
     will be provided with a smaller device that is less bulky and therefore lighter
     than current exoskeletons and it can be used both inside the hospital and
     at home, guaranteeing improved motor functions in children.</b></li>

<br/><p></p>
<p>With the new model of the robotic hip and pelvis we intend to continue the line of research  carried out by our laboratory and create a model that exceeds the limits of passive systems that exist today. Passive systems are those systems that use levers, pulleys, springs, or other elastic elements, but do not use motors. Passive systems utilize propelling the wearer, not allowing an adaptation to the patient's progress. </p>
<p>  The active systems use, however, the propelling of the motors which are an integral part. The robot in this category can be programmed to change the interaction with the child to increase the capacity of recovery of motor function</p>

<h3><b>SUPPORT OUR PROJECT. YOU  NOT ONLY HELP OUR WORK, BUT ALSO GIVE CHILDREN HOPE TO WALK AGAIN.</b></h3>

<h2><b>WHY CROWDFUNDING.</b></h2>
<p><b>Crowdfunding </b>is a process of collective funding from a large number of people who make
monetary contributions of various sums towards a project or initiative they
believe in and become supporters.</p>
<p>This is the reason why we have chosen this platform. We believe that
paediatric research should become a time for sharing as well as public
property, not only when there are tangible results but also from the moment an
innovative and revolutionary idea is in the mind of a researcher. Crowdfunding
means that “we can all make a difference together” and give our children hope
that they will walk again.</p>

Thousands of children and adolescents in Italy and around the world can’t
walk because they have an illness or injury to their central nervous system due
to a congenital or acquired disorder such as cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury,
stroke, brain tumour, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular disorder.

When children are afflicted with one of these disorders or injuries, it is
necessary to start a rehabilitation program to help them walk again.

WHO WE
ARE.
We are a team of researchers at the Laboratory
of Movement Analysis and Robotics (MarLab)
at the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù, and for years we have
been committed to caring for newborns, infants and adolescents that have a brain
or spinal injury. We are actively involved in developing research initiatives
that adapt existing technologies in use for adults to the needs of children. If
this is not possible, we look for completely new solutions. We have developed
high-tech robotic systems for the rehabilitation and recovery of motor
functions in children with brain and/or spinal cord disorders. 

WHAT WE’D
LIKE TO DO.
We want to develop a new exoskeleton
for hips and pelvis to help these
kids to walk again.
An exoskeleton is a robot that supports movement and is characterised by
sensors and a computerised control system that young patients can “wear” to
help them recover their motor functions.
We want to design a device that has never been
developed in Italy or the world before and goes beyond existing systems inasmuch as: 

It can
     be used for all children under the age of two
The
     orthosis can be custom fit and adapted in order to recover motor functions
     that are currently difficult to attain because existing robots must be
     substituted as the child grows. This will reduce gait rehabilitation
     times.
Patients
     will be provided with a smaller device that is less bulky and therefore lighter
     than current exoskeletons and it can be used both inside the hospital and
     at home, guaranteeing improved motor functions in children.


WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP.












Our project consists of 4 distinct phases. In order to begin to develop the prototype of the exoskeleton we need t 40,000 euros, the minimum amount  to kick off the FIRST PHASE namely the mechanical and electronic design of the model. Your contribution is therefore vital. Without it, the design could not start.


PROJECT PHASES:




With the new model of the robotic hip and pelvis we intend to continue the line of research  carried out by our laboratory and create a model that exceeds the limits of passive systems that exist today. Passive systems are those systems that use levers, pulleys, springs, or other elastic elements, but do not use motors. Passive systems utilize propelling the wearer, not allowing an adaptation to the patient's progress. 
  The active systems use, however, the propelling of the motors which are an integral part. The robot in this category can be programmed to change the interaction with the child to increase the capacity of recovery of motor function


SUPPORT OUR PROJECT. YOU  NOT ONLY HELP OUR WORK, BUT ALSO GIVE CHILDREN HOPE TO WALK AGAIN.

WHY CROWDFUNDING.
Crowdfunding is a process of collective funding from a large number of people who make
monetary contributions of various sums towards a project or initiative they
believe in and become supporters.
This is the reason why we have chosen this platform. We believe that
paediatric research should become a time for sharing as well as public
property, not only when there are tangible results but also from the moment an
innovative and revolutionary idea is in the mind of a researcher. Crowdfunding
means that “we can all make a difference together” and give our children hope
that they will walk again.


HOW YOU
CAN HELP.
""GIVE A LEG UP"" TO OUR PROJECT
There are many ways you can support us. The most direct? Donate as much as you can, even a few euros can
make a big difference. As an expression of our appreciation we have created
some “perks” as a tangible sign of your participation. Look at the column on
your right and choose the one you prefer. You can also donate any other amount
and notify us that you don’t want anything in exchange. Send us your email and
make your payment via PayPal. 
For more information about supporting us go to the web page www.donaora.it 

""MAKE SOME NOISE"" ABOUT OUR PROJECT
You can help spread the word about the idea by talking to people about it if you like the
project and you believe in it. Share it with your friends, family and
colleagues via email, Facebook, twitter, or use the share tools above the
presentation video. It’s a fast and easy way to multiply the value of our initiative!

THE OSPEDALE PEDIATRICO BAMBINO GESU'.
The Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù  founded in 1869, is owned by the Holy See and is a
work of the Holy Father. It is recognized as the largest children’s
hospital and research center in Europe. It is one of the leading comprehensive healthcare facilities and one of
the three children’s institutes for scientific research and care in Italy. Over
the years it has developed many internationally recognized research activities.

It is the largest children’s hospital in Europe providing high complexity
care in terms of the number of hospital stays and specialised services it
offers and it is also the only European facility that can meet all the
requirements for paediatric transplantation.

</p><p>Businesses
with online stores increasingly have started opening brick-and-mortar stores, and vice-versa. However, most are stuck in a world where they have to
use a POS for their 'offline' store(s) that is completely disconnected from their
‘online’ store. Seamless multi-channel retail is no longer a luxury, but
increasingly a necessity.</p>
<p><i>We solve this pain for retailers by offering a POS that works directly with their existing e-commerce sites. </i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/785003/files/20140813060307-POS_4.jpg?1407934987"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>No more hassles managing products on two systems and purchasing add-ons to work separately online and offline. By using our POS which works with your existing e-commerce sites, you save time and money. You don't have to manage your inventory on 2 systems or manually try to reconcile accounting from your in-store and online sales. Instead, you see combined business performance in one place and lower your accounting and administration fees in the process. </p><p>We have already built our POS to work with Magento, SEOShop and Spree Commerce and are looking to built it on other e-commerce platforms such as WooCommerce, PrestaShop and BigCommerce. The reasons for building it on existing e-commerce platforms are two-fold:</p><p></p><ol>
<li>All eCommerce platforms we build upon are very stable and have huge communities of developers maintaining and correcting problems. By building on top of these platforms, you are assured of a properly functioning, stable, reliable POS from day 1.<br/>
</li>
<li>You already use your eCommerce system. Why force you to learn a totally new system, and why go through the hassle of moving your products from one to another?</li>

<p><b>I do not have a webstore, is CashOrCard POS still
the right product for me?</b>  Yes absolutely! Seamlessly integrated eCommerce is a feature of CashOrCard POS, but our software is designed to run your store operations even if you do not have an eCommerce site. We will provide you with our own CashOrCard engine to manage your store. The beautiful design and easy back office mean it is definitely more than just a useful product for your business - it's a necessity.</p>
<p><b>I have a restaurant and I need a floor map. </b>We are building features for restaurants, bars, hotel and hairdressers at the moment. Features include open orders for tables and floor maps. We
expect to launch these early next year.</p>
<p><b>How can I know that you will deliver for sure? </b> Unlike most crowdfunding campaigns, we already
have a product ready to go and are looking to build in support for more platforms. At the moment, we are already ready with Magento, SpreeCommerce and SEOshop.</p>

<p>Geen

<p>CashOrCard
POS is te koppelen aan Magento, SEOshop en Spree Commerce. Op korte termijn kan

<p>De
twee hoofdzakelijke redenen dat wij CashOrCard POS gebouwd hebben op bestaande
e-commerce platformen zijn:<br/>1.
Alle te koppelen e-commerce platformen zijn betrouwbaar en hebben een sterke
(online) gemeenschap voor ontwikkelaars. De platformen worden continue
doorontwikkeld door experts. En daardoor kan je rekenen op een vertrouwd en stabiel
kassasysteem.<br/>2.
Je gebruikt al een e-commerce platform. Waarom een totaal nieuw systeem opnieuw

Introducing the Point of Sale that works seamlessly with your existing e-commerce software such as Magento, WooCommerce and SEOshop.


Businesses
with online stores increasingly have started opening brick-and-mortar stores, and vice-versa. However, most are stuck in a world where they have to
use a POS for their 'offline' store(s) that is completely disconnected from their
‘online’ store. Seamless multi-channel retail is no longer a luxury, but
increasingly a necessity.
We solve this pain for retailers by offering a POS that works directly with their existing e-commerce sites. No more hassles managing products on two systems and purchasing add-ons to work separately online and offline. By using our POS which works with your existing e-commerce sites, you save time and money. You don't have to manage your inventory on 2 systems or manually try to reconcile accounting from your in-store and online sales. Instead, you see combined business performance in one place and lower your accounting and administration fees in the process. We have already built our POS to work with Magento, SEOShop and Spree Commerce and are looking to built it on other e-commerce platforms such as WooCommerce, PrestaShop and BigCommerce. The reasons for building it on existing e-commerce platforms are two-fold:
All eCommerce platforms we build upon are very stable and have huge communities of developers maintaining and correcting problems. By building on top of these platforms, you are assured of a properly functioning, stable, reliable POS from day 1.

You already use your eCommerce system. Why force you to learn a totally new system, and why go through the hassle of moving your products from one to another?

Get one of our Perks and take advantage of unique discounts!

The perks in this campaign give you a 30% to 55% discount on the premium subscription rates depending on the duration of subscription you choose. 
We have given below the normal pricing for our Cash Register so you know what you are getting.







We have spent the past few months researching, developing, testing and continuously improving CashOrCard POS. We have developed a world-class POS alongside real business owners, and we already have a ready-to-release product.
But now we need your help! Your support will help us add more e-commerce platforms and lots of new features (table layouts, mobile ordering, personnel management etc...) over the coming months.




We know we have built a great product and stand behind our work. If you are not happy with our Cash Register after using it for 30 days, then request a refund and we will give you your contribution back.



SAVE even more!
For every person who comes here via your link and makes a contribution, we will give you a €10
refund at the end of the campaign, up to the amount of your contribution.
How it works: Pledge for at least a 6 months subscription to get
your personal tracking URL. Then, use the share buttons or copy your unique URL
below the video at the top of this page to spread the word about
CashOrCard POS and start collecting refunds! Post it to your blog, share
it on Facebook, BuzzFeed, Twitter, or simply tell your friends! Make sure you are logged in to IndieGogo and use your personal URL for sharing so your referrals are registered!
Example: Pledge
for the 1 year Subscription. Then, get 5 of your friends to also
contribute. We will credit you €10 for each additional contributor you bring on. After your
contribution, we send you an email with instructions on how to track your
progress.
Our most successful ambassadors get extra rewards. These rewards
are also available for those who didn't yet order .
• 
Top 1 campaigner gets one free Google Nexus 10 tablet.
• 
Top 50 campaigners each get an additional 6 months of premium subscription.
The
number of successful referrals at the end of the campaign determines your final
ranking. 



We will provide all the required hardware you need to set up the Cash Register in your store at great prices. When setting up your account with us, we will discuss your specific requirements and will ship the hardware you need to you.
We only work with high quality products from leading providers of hardware such as:
Apple & Samsung     TabletsStar Micronics            WiFi printer & cash drawerSocket Mobile            Barcode scannerAdyen                           Payments terminal





I do not have a webstore, is CashOrCard POS still
the right product for me?  Yes absolutely! Seamlessly integrated eCommerce is a feature of CashOrCard POS, but our software is designed to run your store operations even if you do not have an eCommerce site. We will provide you with our own CashOrCard engine to manage your store. The beautiful design and easy back office mean it is definitely more than just a useful product for your business - it's a necessity.
I have a restaurant and I need a floor map. We are building features for restaurants, bars, hotel and hairdressers at the moment. Features include open orders for tables and floor maps. We
expect to launch these early next year.
How can I know that you will deliver for sure?  Unlike most crowdfunding campaigns, we already
have a product ready to go and are looking to build in support for more platforms. At the moment, we are already ready with Magento, SpreeCommerce and SEOshop.
We're open to your questions and ideas! Contact us
at support@cashorcardpos.com

CashOrCard POS,
het offline kassasysteem dat naadloos aansluit op de e-commercesoftware van
webshops. 





Nu veel
ondernemingen zich zowel offline als online begeven, stuiten ze vaak op het
probleem hoe beide
bedrijfsvoeringen eenvoudig samen zijn te voegen in één
systeem.  Wij lossen
dit op met ons kassasysteem app (voor tablets)  waarmee je snel en simpel
de e-commerce software kan koppelen aan jouw fysieke kassa.
Geen
gedoe meer met dubbele werkzaamheden en aparte hulpmodules voor de
verschillende systemen.In
plaats van aparte voorraadbeheer programma's, boekhouding voor zowel offline
als online, verschillende verkoopresultaten, kan je nu alles vanuit een punt
makkelijk en overzichtelijk managen. Op termijn levert de tijdwinst ook
kostenverlaging op in de boekhouding.
Met
CashOrCard POS gekoppeld aan je e-commerce website, bespaar je tijd en geld.

CashOrCard
POS is te koppelen aan Magento, SEOshop en Spree Commerce. Op korte termijn kan
je ook toevoeging van Woocommerce, Prestashop
en BigCommerce verwachten.
De
twee hoofdzakelijke redenen dat wij CashOrCard POS gebouwd hebben op bestaande
e-commerce platformen zijn:1.
Alle te koppelen e-commerce platformen zijn betrouwbaar en hebben een sterke
(online) gemeenschap voor ontwikkelaars. De platformen worden continue
doorontwikkeld door experts. En daardoor kan je rekenen op een vertrouwd en stabiel
kassasysteem.2.
Je gebruikt al een e-commerce platform. Waarom een totaal nieuw systeem opnieuw
en alle artikelen voor de 2e keer invoeren als dit onnodig is?






Pak je
voordeel en maak gebruik van deze eenmalige unieke aanbiedingen!
De
aanbiedingen (Perks) lopen op tot 55%! De hoogte van de korting is afhankelijk
van de gekozen tijdsduur van het Premium
Customer Support abonnement.Als je kiest voor de aanbieding van 2 jaar dan betaal je maandelijks minder dan €24 ipv de standaardprijs van €49 per maand. 
Onderstaand zie je een overzicht wat wij gratis aanbieden en wat het Premium aanbod inhoudt.





Afgelopen
maanden hebben we CashOrCard POS ontwikkelt en uitvoerig getest. Samen met
winkeliers hebben we tijdens de operationele tests de spreekwoordelijke laatste
puntjes op de i gezet.
Maar
we hebben nu je hulp nodig. Me jouw aankoop van een van de aanbiedingen kunnen
we sneller nog meer e-commerce platformen toevoegen aan CashOrCard POS.




We
garanderen dat we een top product aanbieden. Mocht je toch ontevreden zijn over
ons kassasysteem binnen de eerste 30 dagen van je abonnement, dan geven
we je geld terug.

Wil jij nog meer korting?
Wordt CashOrCard POS Ambassadeur!Voor
iedere persoon die jij aandraagt (dmv link delen) en hij/zij een van onze
'Perks’ koopt (minimale besteding moet €199 zijn) krijg je €10 korting.Voorbeeld:Koop
de Perk '6 month subscription’ en ontvang je eigen persoonlijke tracking URL.
Verspreid de link aan vrienden, bekenden, izakelijke relaties en ontvang voor
elke nieuwe aankoop via jouw link €10 extra korting. De
meest succesvolle ambassadeur ontvangt 1 gratis Nexus 10 tabletTop
50 ambassadeurs krijgen 6 maanden gratis Premium abonnement t.w.v. €294

<h2> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/605533/pictures/full/20130105084003-Anderson_Cooper_Live.png?1357404014"" src="""" style=""""/>

<h2>The Product</h2>
<p><strong>The Party Plate</strong> is a custom design of paper and plastic plates. The plates are disposable with a detachable handle in the center that houses the beverage (can, bottle, cup, etc.), which allows the guest to have a<strong> free</strong> hand to eat, drink and socialize without the common restrictions that come along with holding a plate in one hand and a drink in the other. It's not your typical paper or plastic plate;.... it's a <em><strong>""premium food service item</strong></em>"" that will solve a dilemma and improve any party where there are not enough tables or chairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Ocatagon Party Plate"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/605987/pictures/full/20130105162757-RMC_041.jpg?1357432085"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Biodegradable Presidential Platter</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How It All Started</h2>
<p>The concept and idea came out of sheer frustration. We were attending an outdoor party with approximately 150 guests. The mosquitos were so annoying that the host had to bring the party indoors. The house quickly became very crowded. Guests were trying to juggle their plates and drinks while hugging, greeting and shaking hands. Every time we would set our drinks down to eat or greet a person, someone inadvertently took our drinks or placed another person's drink next to ours and no one could decide whose drink belong to whom.....<strong>we've all been in this situation before</strong>. We stayed after the party to help with the clean-up and poured (at least) 70 cans, bottles and glasses of half drank drinks down the drain. The next day saw the beginnings of The Party Plate.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Party Plates are Great for:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cocktail Parties</li>
<li>Tailgating Parties</li>
<li>Family Reunions</li>
<li>Picnics / Barbecues</li>
<li>Super Bowl (Sports) Parties</li>
<li>Buffets</li>
<li>New Year Eve Parties</li>
<li>Corporate Parties</li>
<li>Caterers &amp; Event Planners</li>
<li>
<em>You Name A Party And The Party Plate Will Make It A Better Party</em>!</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2>The Party Plates Benefits:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Controls Food Portions - Saving Money</li>
<li>Saves On Wasted Drinks - No More Misplaced Drinks</li>
<li>Allows Guests To Mingle Comfortably</li>
<li>Cuts Down On Spillage</li>
<li>Improves Any Party Where There Are Not Enough Chairs or Tables</li>
<li>They're Biodegradable and Disposable</li>
<li>They Allow Product/Theme Branding - Your Name, Logo, Event</li>
<li>They Come Twenty-Four Plates To A Box</li>
<li>They're Affordable</li>

The Product
The Party Plate is a custom design of paper and plastic plates. The plates are disposable with a detachable handle in the center that houses the beverage (can, bottle, cup, etc.), which allows the guest to have a free hand to eat, drink and socialize without the common restrictions that come along with holding a plate in one hand and a drink in the other. It's not your typical paper or plastic plate;.... it's a ""premium food service item"" that will solve a dilemma and improve any party where there are not enough tables or chairs.
 

 Octagon Party Plate
 
Biodegradable Presidential Platter
 
How It All Started
The concept and idea came out of sheer frustration. We were attending an outdoor party with approximately 150 guests. The mosquitos were so annoying that the host had to bring the party indoors. The house quickly became very crowded. Guests were trying to juggle their plates and drinks while hugging, greeting and shaking hands. Every time we would set our drinks down to eat or greet a person, someone inadvertently took our drinks or placed another person's drink next to ours and no one could decide whose drink belong to whom.....we've all been in this situation before. We stayed after the party to help with the clean-up and poured (at least) 70 cans, bottles and glasses of half drank drinks down the drain. The next day saw the beginnings of The Party Plate.
 
The Party Plates are Great for:

Cocktail Parties
Tailgating Parties
Family Reunions
Picnics / Barbecues
Super Bowl (Sports) Parties
Buffets
New Year Eve Parties
Corporate Parties
Caterers & Event Planners

You Name A Party And The Party Plate Will Make It A Better Party!
 
The Party Plates Benefits:

Controls Food Portions - Saving Money
Saves On Wasted Drinks - No More Misplaced Drinks
Allows Guests To Mingle Comfortably
Cuts Down On Spillage
Improves Any Party Where There Are Not Enough Chairs or Tables
They're Biodegradable and Disposable
They Allow Product/Theme Branding - Your Name, Logo, Event
They Come Twenty-Four Plates To A Box
They're Affordable
 
The Perfect Pairing
If a person loves outdoor events and activities, the odds are that they own one or more of the 15,000,000 folding bag chairs that are in circulation in the United States. Whether it's a Tailgating Party, Concert / Movie in the Park, a Day at the Beach or whatever the activity, The Party Plate is the perfect companion to most folding bag chairs.

<h3>Beacon - a pedestrian and bicyclist friendly community</h3>
<p>BeaconArts needs your help to fund bicycle shared-lane pavement markings (""sharrows"" - (SHared ARROWS) indicate that the roadway should be shared between motorists and bicyclists) on Main Street.  Your contribution will not only help finish funding for Phase 1 of the project (sharrows on Main St.); but also show support to extend these facilities throughout Beacon.  Additional funds will support additional sharrow projects in Beacon.</p>
<p>Heck - the legendary rock group Queen wrote a song about riding bicycles (see below)!  Let's honor them by filling this gap and providing support for places where you can ride your bicycle safely.  If only Queen could see Beacon today...</p>
<p>Beacon has emerged as a destination hotspot in the Hudson Valley.  Residents and visitors frequent Main Street for the shops, restaurants, and galleries, yet there aren't adequate facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists.  Several organizations (<a href=""http://beaconarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://beaconarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BeaconArts</a> and <a href=""http://www.scenichudson.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.scenichudson.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scenic Hudson</a>), local businesses (<a href=""http://www.peoplesbicycle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.peoplesbicycle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peoples Bicycle</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BeaconCycles"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BeaconCycles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beacon Cycles</a>, <a href=""http://banksquarecoffeehouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://banksquarecoffeehouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bank Sq.

<p>Amenities for all users (pedestrians and bicyclists) have numerous benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety:  Slower traffic results in fewer accidents and less severe injuries. Also, clear indication of where users should be decreases risk of conflict.  It creates a safer environment for motorists and bicyclists!</li>
<li>Revenue:  Increased foot traffic and alternative modes of transportation like bicycles results in more people stopping and frequenting local businesses.</li>
<li>Health:  News flash!  Riding a bicycle or walking burns calories.</li>
<li>Inspiration:  Beacon already has a bike and pedestrian culture.  Facilitating greater and safer bicycle networks encourages more people to get on their bicycles to get around town or beyond!</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Environment:  Burn calories, not fossil fuels which pollute the environment.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And last but not least, it's:</p>
<ul><li>FUN!:  Have you ever seen a person frowning on a bicycle?  No, because they have a blissful smile on their face as a gentle breeze flows through their hair.</li></ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpy4xNAnWzM?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Support = Celebrity status in Beacon</span><br/></p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly to BeaconArts who has already paid for the sharrows.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Funding will be used to complete Phase 1:  Sharrows on Main Street.  If this campaign is successful, we will look to Phase 2:  Extending Sharrows from Main Street to the Beacon Train Station and Phase 3:  Sharrows along Tioronda Ave. (Fishkill Creek) - so stay tuned and please provide positive feedback (because you don't want bad karma).  In return for your generous support, we have several one of a kind, Beacon only rewards that will make you a celebrity in town.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ever want to design your own BURRITO, SANDWICH, or SUNDAE at a restaurant and have them NAME IT AFTER YOU?  Well, here is your chance.  Through the generosity of several Main St. shops, you'll have that chance to work with the burrito experts, a bagel craftsmen, and a sundae architect to design and build your own culinary creation.</li>
<li>Other perks include a free coffee, kayak rental and tune-up from businesses voted ""Best of"" by <i>Hudson Valley Magazine</i>.</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If we don't reach our funding goal...well, that's not going to happen because you won't let it - right?</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Your support goes beyond just this project </h3>
<p>These sharrows were the first in Dutchess County and even for the Mid-Hudson Region.  It received support from the NYS Hudson River Valley Greenway and Dutchess County.</p>
<p>Beacon is a leader:  Numerous towns in the Hudson Valley took notice and have been implementing these same techniques to provide safe facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians.</p>
<p>Your involvement acknowledges that pedestrian and bicyclist facilities are critical to a healthy Main Street environment for residents and visitors.  In fact, your support demonstrates community support for these types of projects which helps when communities look to the state for assistance.  So, really, your contribution has a lasting impact and can potentially help leverage additional funding.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't contribute, no problem:</p>

Heck - the legendary rock group Queen wrote a song about riding bicycles (see below)!  Let's honor them by filling this gap and providing support for places where you can ride your bicycle safely.  If only Queen could see Beacon today...
Beacon has emerged as a destination hotspot in the Hudson Valley.  Residents and visitors frequent Main Street for the shops, restaurants, and galleries, yet there aren't adequate facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists.  Several organizations (BeaconArts and Scenic Hudson), local businesses (Peoples Bicycle, Beacon Cycles, Bank Sq. Coffeehouse, Mountain Tops, Tito Santana's, The Beacon Bagel, and the Beacon Creamery), and community members (Stowe Boyd) are working to include amenities on Main Street so all users feel safe.
Amenities for all users (pedestrians and bicyclists) have numerous benefits:

Safety:  Slower traffic results in fewer accidents and less severe injuries. Also, clear indication of where users should be decreases risk of conflict.  It creates a safer environment for motorists and bicyclists!
Revenue:  Increased foot traffic and alternative modes of transportation like bicycles results in more people stopping and frequenting local businesses.
Health:  News flash!  Riding a bicycle or walking burns calories.
Inspiration:  Beacon already has a bike and pedestrian culture.  Facilitating greater and safer bicycle networks encourages more people to get on their bicycles to get around town or beyond!

Environment:  Burn calories, not fossil fuels which pollute the environment.


And last but not least, it's:
FUN!:  Have you ever seen a person frowning on a bicycle?  No, because they have a blissful smile on their face as a gentle breeze flows through their hair.

Support = Celebrity status in Beacon
Your contribution will go directly to BeaconArts who has already paid for the sharrows.
Funding will be used to complete Phase 1:  Sharrows on Main Street.  If this campaign is successful, we will look to Phase 2:  Extending Sharrows from Main Street to the Beacon Train Station and Phase 3:  Sharrows along Tioronda Ave. (Fishkill Creek) - so stay tuned and please provide positive feedback (because you don't want bad karma).  In return for your generous support, we have several one of a kind, Beacon only rewards that will make you a celebrity in town.

Ever want to design your own BURRITO, SANDWICH, or SUNDAE at a restaurant and have them NAME IT AFTER YOU?  Well, here is your chance.  Through the generosity of several Main St. shops, you'll have that chance to work with the burrito experts, a bagel craftsmen, and a sundae architect to design and build your own culinary creation.
Other perks include a free coffee, kayak rental and tune-up from businesses voted ""Best of"" by Hudson Valley Magazine.

If we don't reach our funding goal...well, that's not going to happen because you won't let it - right?




Your support goes beyond just this project 
These sharrows were the first in Dutchess County and even for the Mid-Hudson Region.  It received support from the NYS Hudson River Valley Greenway and Dutchess County.
Beacon is a leader:  Numerous towns in the Hudson Valley took notice and have been implementing these same techniques to provide safe facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians.
Your involvement acknowledges that pedestrian and bicyclist facilities are critical to a healthy Main Street environment for residents and visitors.  In fact, your support demonstrates community support for these types of projects which helps when communities look to the state for assistance.  So, really, your contribution has a lasting impact and can potentially help leverage additional funding.


Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are an Arizona foster family. We currently have two foster children in our house. This is our second round of being a foster family. We really enjoy helping these children get into a stable environment with structure and caring.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> Until a foster family has been licensed by the state, there is little finacial support to help with the additional expenses. The licensing process is lengthy, involving FBI background checks, education classes, home studies and many other strict guidelines that must be met. We are currently working toward this, however, up to this point we have not been paid as a licensed foster family. The reimbursement for unlicensed families is only pennies per day for each child. We have only been receiving about $15 per month per child.</p>
<p>Anyone that has children will know that this does not even start to cover the expenses of raising a child without special needs. This does not even consider that foster children often need therapy, as our children do, plus the added cost of many doctors appointments, day care, new school supplies and clothes. Most times children arrive to a foster family with only the outift they are currently wearing.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED: </strong>Our current A/C unit has needed repair five times already this summer. It has stopped work three days this week alone. Our hope is to get a new unit installed prior to this one failing completely. Our current system is at least 15 years old. The furnace blower barely pushes the air around the house. You can see in the photo how old and rusty our current unit is.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Check the gallery for scans of an actual check from the state.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have quotes from a reputable local installer for various system options. If we can reach our goal we will be able to get a new A/C and furnace along with new ductwork to areas of the house that do not already have climate controled air. These new areas will be used as bedrooms to provide for more children.</p>
<p>We also have quotes for options to only replace the A/C unit. If we do not reach the full goal we will use the money that we do get to replace as much as we can.</p>

Jon and his team are trying to do something different with this paper. We're trying to provide a media vehicle to not only express Onkwehon:we news and concerns coming from Six Nations, but to reach out with a mass circulation free weekly newspaper (23,000 copies a week) that can speak to and bring together a wide variety of native and non-native communities together.
<br/><br/>Joining forces with Jon is his cousin Benjamin Doolittle, the <i><b>Two Row Times</b></i> website manager, who owns an independent Onkwehon:we web <a href=""http://www.doolittleproductions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>design company</b></a>, With Benjamin's direct support the website presence has been launched into the forefront of all competing markets. <br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>The Two Row Wampum – the original agreement between Onkwehon:we people and the new arrivals on this continent – is our guiding light and affects everything that we do with our paper.

<h4>The <i><a href=""http://www.tworowtimes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Two Row Times</a></i> provides a unique Onkwehon:we news source that can unify and uplift all people. We believe that a coming together of native and non-native people to express our common interests in healing the earth, honouring diversity and creating respectful and dignified conditions of life for all is the only way to ensure our continued survival as human beings.</h4>
It has been increasingly apparent since the rise of the Idle No More movement that indigenous people in Turtle Island are in resurgence. The Anishinabe prophecies of the 7th and 8th fires are upon us and the choices we need to take are apparant. But we need more than protests. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We need to develop the media institutions that can reflect and express the interests of Onkwehon:we people and to unify with all who want to stop harming and start healing mother Earth.
<br/><br/>Indigenous people on Turtle Island aren't exactly overflowing with cash. But we believe that the time has come for a publication like the </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><a href=""http://www.tworowtimes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Two Row Times</b></a>. </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If everyone even donates a small amount, we can build our media together. With your help we can raise the funds that will make it possible for us to grow and flourish.</span><br/><h1>The Impact</h1>
<h4>Your contribution will make it possible for us to keep bringing you news and opinions from the front lines of Onkwehon:we existence on this land. We will be using the money you donate to hire Onkwehon:we journalists and correspondents, employ the distributors that keep more than 500 pickup locations stocked with papers, and to of course print the paper and keep our office running.</h4>
If you've never seen our paper before, you can check out all our<b> <a href=""http://issuu.com/tworowtimes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">back issues here</a></b>.

It is worth stressing that this is a unique media project. <br/><br/>Due to the history of colonization and oppression that Onkwehon:we people have faced, we don't have much in the way of media that reaches beyond the reserve.

The Two Row Times is an exciting newspaper coming out of the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory – the largest Onkwehon:we (indigenous) community within Canada. The Newspaper and the Website both Launched in August of 2013, the paper is led by its founder Jonathan Garlow. Jonathan is of Mohawk and Pottawotami descent and is a musician, beats-producer, writer, and printer by trade.
Jon and his team are trying to do something different with this paper. We're trying to provide a media vehicle to not only express Onkwehon:we news and concerns coming from Six Nations, but to reach out with a mass circulation free weekly newspaper (23,000 copies a week) that can speak to and bring together a wide variety of native and non-native communities together.
Joining forces with Jon is his cousin Benjamin Doolittle, the Two Row Times website manager, who owns an independent Onkwehon:we web design company, With Benjamin's direct support the website presence has been launched into the forefront of all competing markets. The Two Row Wampum – the original agreement between Onkwehon:we people and the new arrivals on this continent – is our guiding light and affects everything that we do with our paper. Like the Two Row, the staff at our paper pledge to keep everything we do consistent with the principles of the Two Row Wampum and the Kaianerekowa – ""the great peace"" – a philosophical and constitutional framework that provides the basis of Haudenosaunee Confederacy and the Onkwehon:we way of life.Why you should care
The Two Row Times provides a unique Onkwehon:we news source that can unify and uplift all people. We believe that a coming together of native and non-native people to express our common interests in healing the earth, honouring diversity and creating respectful and dignified conditions of life for all is the only way to ensure our continued survival as human beings.
It has been increasingly apparent since the rise of the Idle No More movement that indigenous people in Turtle Island are in resurgence. The Anishinabe prophecies of the 7th and 8th fires are upon us and the choices we need to take are apparant. But we need more than protests. We need to develop the media institutions that can reflect and express the interests of Onkwehon:we people and to unify with all who want to stop harming and start healing mother Earth.
Indigenous people on Turtle Island aren't exactly overflowing with cash. But we believe that the time has come for a publication like the Two Row Times. If everyone even donates a small amount, we can build our media together. With your help we can raise the funds that will make it possible for us to grow and flourish.The Impact
Your contribution will make it possible for us to keep bringing you news and opinions from the front lines of Onkwehon:we existence on this land. We will be using the money you donate to hire Onkwehon:we journalists and correspondents, employ the distributors that keep more than 500 pickup locations stocked with papers, and to of course print the paper and keep our office running.
If you've never seen our paper before, you can check out all our back issues here.

It is worth stressing that this is a unique media project. Due to the history of colonization and oppression that Onkwehon:we people have faced, we don't have much in the way of media that reaches beyond the reserve.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't like the idea of donating online, you can still send us a check, money order, or come by with cash to our office at 657 Mohawk Road, Six Nations Territory, ON, N0A 1H0.

What seemed easy to do turned out to be a real challenge. Let’s face it! It takes a little more effort to live a greener life than just to replace a few light bulbs.

It’s time – it’s all about not having enough time. </p><p>And, yet, it is clear, our environment demands faster change – from each and every one of us. So we began searching for a solution to make green living easier to achieve. </p><p>We wrote a book. But with a book, you have to sit down and do all that planning again. “Not helpful enough!” we thought. We need a platform, a social network, a shop directory, a tailor made “go-green guide” for individuals to follow step-by-step to live a greener lifestyle to accommodate personal goals and busy lives. We need an ALL-IN-ONE site with which people can start to live a greener lifestyle within 10 minutes. We need a well-structured site that makes it easy for everybody to live a greener life including a network for swarm intelligence to share efficient information to reach the goal fast.

By making it easy for
everybody to green-up with some cool tools we give sustainability a boost! With

With all our passion we
created RPeople, the perfect place for people who share love and care for this
planet and for future generations to come. Taking Responsibility, acting with Respect

all: the planet.

sustainability spreading positive vibes and having fun doing it! A community of
people who care about what we can do rather than what we cannot do. A place in
the internet where people move the world by finding help, sharing information

carrying. And who says that green living is not cool? There are so many cool

Vanessa Bekk is a citizen of the
United States and Switzerland. She is the creative one with education and
experience in the Fine Arts. In business she discovered her passion for
creating cool concepts for marketing. Her practical way of thinking and the
urge to find the most efficient way to live a greener life, is what made
RPeople happen in the first place. Vanessa never gets tired of finding and
creating new ways and shares them with others. What best describes Vanessa:
“Where there’s a will, there’s a way and don’t bore me with “it’s difficult.” 
Gernot Bekk is a Styrian oak
(like Arnold Schwarzenegger - just less muscles). Gernot studied information
technology and economics - and now you know who programmed the RPeople site. He
is well-known for creating unique marketing strategies in the business world.
When he’s not thinking about what else RPeople need, he spends his time in the
world of online marketing for RPeople. His passion for green living and the
wish to help more people living it too drives him to extraordinary achievements.
What best describes Gernot: Creative nerd or: “Do you honestly think that
numbers don’t have feelings?” 



Shefali is
the health expert of RPeole. This Ayurvedic doctor with experience in allopathy
is the person you want to have by your side in order to live a healthier life!
She brings experience over 20 years into the team and looks at green living
from a healthy point of view. What makes Shefali so special is that she acts
with respect and includes personal life situations into lifestyle adjustments.
If you ever meet her in person and start to talk about your problems, it might
very well be that she gives you the answer just as if that was the most natural
thing on earth. And if you think that Shefali sits in her yoga position and
preaches the “better way”, you should see her at 11pm at a dinner party
enjoying life – this woman knows how much fun a healthy and green life brings!

Is Bernd
Sonalkar another nerd in the RPeople team? Yes! Fortunately, Bernd is what we like to
call “the cool nerd”. He somehow manages to keep his genius brains on earth
which makes him a very special and fun to be with member of the team. Bernd is
a physicist and chemist and brings his knowledge of science into the team. Is
that important for green living? Don’t even ask him this question – he won’t
stop explaining until you have completely understood the importance of treating
atoms the green way!
We combine technical and practical business skills in our team. Our key to success: Love and passion for RPeople and the true calling to help save this planet.“Let’s live a more sustainable lifestyle.” we said to ourselves. What seemed easy to do turned out to be a real challenge. Let’s face it! It takes a little more effort to live a greener life than just to replace a few light bulbs. But busy people have only a little time to sit down, make detailed plans, and reorganize things. It’s time – it’s all about not having enough time. And, yet, it is clear, our environment demands faster change – from each and every one of us. So we began searching for a solution to make green living easier to achieve. We wrote a book. But with a book, you have to sit down and do all that planning again. “Not helpful enough!” we thought. We need a platform, a social network, a shop directory, a tailor made “go-green guide” for individuals to follow step-by-step to live a greener lifestyle to accommodate personal goals and busy lives. We need an ALL-IN-ONE site with which people can start to live a greener lifestyle within 10 minutes. We need a well-structured site that makes it easy for everybody to live a greener life including a network for swarm intelligence to share efficient information to reach the goal fast. That felt good! And so we created RPeople. RPeopole is a platform and social network where people can find everything they need to live a more sustainable and healthy life more easily – more quickly. www.rpeople.com is a platform and social network for people who want to live a more healthy and sustainable life. RPeople offer an ALL-IN-ONE solution that helps people to green-up their lives more easily – more quickly. The key site locations The R-Check Stop wasting your time gathering information on green living to help you figure out how you are going to integrate green living into your life. Just start with the first milestone in the R-Check. Answer only a few questions. Then you will receive your personal task list via email. This task list helps guide you step by step to a greener lifestyle. It also tells you how to go about it. Making green-living changes in your lifehas never been easier. The R-Space Have you already begun buying more sustainable products? If so, you have most probably have had to buy several different products before you found the product that also matches your individual style, needs, and quality. What did you do with the products you didn’t like? Are they still in your home or did you throw them away? Such waste of material and time can be reduced, even avoided. In the R-Space, we create regional groups where people living in a certain region can exchange information on products and services of that region. People can save a lot of time and money by asking each other for information before buying a new product. Categories In the 8 categories, we offer blogs, forums, a green guide and link selection. Our goal is to find bloggers who write cool blogs and give tips that make green living easier. We focus on easy and fast  problem-solving  methods only. We don’t waste time talking about what is bad, or doesn’t fit into our product wish. This is the exchange platform of the RPeople site.  People here meet on a global level in the forums in order to assist each other with information. The Shop directoryThe green shop directory will also be available as an App. There you are in town, and you suddenly feel like eating an organic burger. All you have to do is take out your smart phone and follow the instructions on the map. And did you know…That most suppliers of sustainable products have difficulties finding effective advertising space on internet? On the RPeople site, suppliers can advertise regionally, categorically and globally. It is very important to create ad space for small businesses on the sustainable market. Advertising on RPeople is affordable also for small suppliers. We need to support them in making good business.Not only do RPeople help people live more healthy and sustainable lifestyles. We help the sustainable market to evolve faster for both small and big suppliers of sustainable products and services.",31.0,1,"2 Campaigns

In the rural areas of Appalachian Ohio some homes have inadequate or no septic tanks and raw sewage is draining directly into streams and seeping into underground water where people have their wells.

     The safety of other homes is destroyed when water leaks blacken the walls, ceilings, and floors with mold and they give way with rot. When sewer lines clog or crumble sewage backs up to flood homes. You can imagine the despair caused when parents don’t have enough funds to protect their families with needed services!


     The World Health Association states that “There cannot be sustained health without sanitation and safe drinking water.”  For the past year Timber Wolff’s Plumbing & Services has used the business’ profit to provide plumbing services to some people who were forced to risk their families’ health by doing without needed services because they lacked enough funds. The need is great and since Timber’s business is so new he doesn’t have the funds to do enough.  Timber Wolff’s Plumbing has the skill, the equipment, and the will to provide the services but he needs help to continue.     


     There are government programs that provide financial assistance for necessary home repair for people with low incomes and we help people to apply. Unfortunately the people who need the services the most are not eligible. Their incomes are too low; they don’t have enough income above their expenses to be eligible for a government loan.

<p>My name is Kathleen Van Dusen. I am a certified Dr Hauschka Esthetician with a small business in Pasadena, CA. I offer healing, nurturing face and body treatments using the pure, botanical preparations of Dr Hauschka Skin Care. The approach I use is one of encouraging a radiant health, a natural beauty and honoring the body's ability to function with it's own natural rhythm. I love, love, love what I do! I love to encourage the gracefulness of aging, the beauty we each have within and contributing to the healing  of humanity and the earth by working with a company that operates with full integrity. My vision is to build and grow my business so that I can broaden my scope and be in a place of truly giving back.</p>
<p>A few years ago, my husband was in a car accident, totaling the car. The subsequent lawsuit wiped us out of all of our savings. Shortly after that, he was downsized and lost his job in the midst of the economic breakdown. During this time, we lost both of our Roth IRA's. After that, he had a health scare that prevented his working at all! Phew....the good news is that he is back up and running and we see good things ahead. My business is still keeping me busy but I have been unable to function at my full capacity. I am looking for funds to rebuild the retail portion of my practice and get myself to the east coast for a trainng that will then enable me to offer additional treatments to grow by business. More importantly, to me, I will be able to offer my services to those in need, be it illness or financial issues.</p>
<p>Dr Hauschka Skin Care, the company I work with, has been 100% natural for over 40 yrs. They use only the highest quality ingredients available. The products are certified by both NATRUE and BDIH. They use biodynamic farming practices as well as founding and supporting initiatives in developing parts of the world to encourage Biodynamic farming and economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>By raising the funds I need, I will be able to encourage and educate more and more people towards a better, healthier, more sustainable way to nurture their health and beauty as well as inspiring them to recognize and foster beauty and well-being in others. Seems the world could use a bit more of that!</p>
<p>I am so appreciative of this opportunity to hopefully raise the bit of money necessary to change the direction of my business and, in turn, help others with my own contributions! If you are unable to donate yourself, feel free to pass this request along to someone who, perhaps can.</p>

<h1 class=""title"">Peer Mentoring Program</h1>
<p>Like <a href=""http://marinersinn.org/peer_mentoring_program"" id=""_GPLITA_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""Powered by Text-Enhance"">diabetes</a> and asthma, addiction is a chronic disease. Until recently, however, most treatment has been based on a short-term acute care model through which individuals receive <em>30 to 90 days of treatment</em> and are then returned to the community with the expectation that they automatically have the skills and resources needed to rebuild their life, succeed, and maintain their sobriety. </p>
<p>Following treatment, these individuals often have no other option but to return to the only lifestyles, neighborhoods, and social networks they know, leaving them highly vulnerable to relapse. When relapse occurs, they are put through the same system again</p>
<p>Mariners Inn’s Peer Mentoring Program will serve individuals and families who are reintegrating into the community following <a href=""http://marinersinn.org/peer_mentoring_program"" id=""_GPLITA_0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""Powered by Text-Enhance"">substance abuse treatment</a> and help them to <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">avoid relapse and maintain a healthy, fulfilling, and independent lifestyle.</span>  </strong><strong>Recovery support services</strong> are ongoing non-clinical services (e.g. social support, mentoring, and linkages to community resources) that help individuals and families who are recovering from substance abuse problems maintain their recovery and improve their quality of life. Recovery support services also provide a bridge back to treatment when needed, ensuring that consumers access treatment promptly rather than waiting until their problem becomes more complex and costly to treat.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Services Provided:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access to community resources that address mental health, education, literacy, employment, entitlements, housing and spiritual needs</li>
<li>Assist consumers in embracing recovery orientated principles and guidelines</li>
<li>Deliver person-centered care</li>
<li>Assist consumers with transitioning back into society</li>
<li>Assist in finding reliable transportation to appointments and interviews</li>
<li>Assist consumer in achieving treatment goals without returning back to treatment and maintain involvement in recovery process</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
Being at Mariners Inn has been the best thing that has happened to me. I have been to two other treatment centers and none of them were as helpful. The staff here truly cares about my recovery and me moving on in life. Through this program I have a better relationship with my son, through the Strengthening Families program. And I have a better relationship with myself. I have set goals now and have the confidence to complete them.<br/>I’m on my way to being a Border Patrol Officer. I am forever thankful and grateful to Mariners Inn.<br/><em><strong>Jerry E.</strong></em>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My life has become better since coming through the doors of Mariner’s Inn. I am a sixtyone year old man with a broken spirit, hopelessness, mentally, and physically bankrupt. I didn’t even love myself and if I can’t love myself how can I love anyone else. Being a drug addict all your life and in the streets, that’s all you know, and your life is down to the animal level. But Mariner’s Inn has shown me a new way to live and a new way of life. They said you can recover. They have given me the tools on a daily basis in my defense against addiction which is a deadly disease. With close to 50 years of addiction, Mariners has given me hope and I’ve become an acceptable, responsible, and productive member of society. Mariner’s goes well beyond the call of duty for everyone who comes through their doors. The staff has much love and passion in doing their job. You can’t puta price tag on it or what they have done for me. They are Angels.<br/><em><strong>Cedric T.</strong></em>

Like diabetes and asthma, addiction is a chronic disease. Until recently, however, most treatment has been based on a short-term acute care model through which individuals receive 30 to 90 days of treatment and are then returned to the community with the expectation that they automatically have the skills and resources needed to rebuild their life, succeed, and maintain their sobriety. 
Following treatment, these individuals often have no other option but to return to the only lifestyles, neighborhoods, and social networks they know, leaving them highly vulnerable to relapse. When relapse occurs, they are put through the same system again
Mariners Inn’s Peer Mentoring Program will serve individuals and families who are reintegrating into the community following substance abuse treatment and help them to avoid relapse and maintain a healthy, fulfilling, and independent lifestyle.  Recovery support services are ongoing non-clinical services (e.g. social support, mentoring, and linkages to community resources) that help individuals and families who are recovering from substance abuse problems maintain their recovery and improve their quality of life. Recovery support services also provide a bridge back to treatment when needed, ensuring that consumers access treatment promptly rather than waiting until their problem becomes more complex and costly to treat.
 
Services Provided:

Access to community resources that address mental health, education, literacy, employment, entitlements, housing and spiritual needs
Assist consumers in embracing recovery orientated principles and guidelines
Deliver person-centered care
Assist consumers with transitioning back into society
Assist in finding reliable transportation to appointments and interviews
Assist consumer in achieving treatment goals without returning back to treatment and maintain involvement in recovery process



The Impact
Being at Mariners Inn has been the best thing that has happened to me. I have been to two other treatment centers and none of them were as helpful. The staff here truly cares about my recovery and me moving on in life. Through this program I have a better relationship with my son, through the Strengthening Families program. And I have a better relationship with myself. I have set goals now and have the confidence to complete them.I’m on my way to being a Border Patrol Officer. I am forever thankful and grateful to Mariners Inn.Jerry E.

 
My life has become better since coming through the doors of Mariner’s Inn. I am a sixtyone year old man with a broken spirit, hopelessness, mentally, and physically bankrupt. I didn’t even love myself and if I can’t love myself how can I love anyone else. Being a drug addict all your life and in the streets, that’s all you know, and your life is down to the animal level. But Mariner’s Inn has shown me a new way to live and a new way of life. They said you can recover. They have given me the tools on a daily basis in my defense against addiction which is a deadly disease. With close to 50 years of addiction, Mariners has given me hope and I’ve become an acceptable, responsible, and productive member of society. Mariner’s goes well beyond the call of duty for everyone who comes through their doors. The staff has much love and passion in doing their job. You can’t puta price tag on it or what they have done for me. They are Angels.Cedric T.

</div></div>","Our Story
In response to the 1968 riots, the L.A.
Junior Chamber of Commerce Charity Foundation established the L.A.
Watts Summer Games to “build bridges of understanding” among high school
youth.  Using sports to foster positive teen development, the Games have
involved over 200,000 students from across Southern California. The Games are the
nation’s largest high school sports event for teens!

The Games' mission is to promote healthy
lifestyles and positive interaction among high school athletes from all ethnic
and socio-economic backgrounds. The Games give participants the opportunity to
compete on a safe, equal-playing field, while practicing the Games’ credo: to “Play
Fair, Respect my Opponent, Win with Integrity, Lose with Dignity and above all,
Pursue the Game with Honor.”
 
The 43rd Annual L.A. Watts
Summer Games is set for June 11, 12 and 18 at LA Southwest College and several high schools throughout the
Greater L.A. Area.  The Games, modeled after the Summer Olympics, will
showcase more than 3,000 athletes competing in basketball, football, soccer,
softball, lacrosse and volleyball. More than 200 high schools will be
represented in this coming year's competition.  A volunteer force of over 300
parents and supporters will help plan and oversee the Games. To see our kids in action during past LAWSG events please visit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/

To encourage success beyond the playing field, an Opportunities Through Education Day will be hosted at LA Southwest College. Along with
college-prep workshops, over 25 universities, community colleges and nonprofits
specializing in college-readiness will be on-hand to share information with
teens and their parents.  
The Impact
The Games offer high school teens a forum to: (1)
showcase their athletic abilities; (2) learn sportsmanship and display positive team spirit; (3)
enhance social growth; (4) keep their mind and body healthy; and (5) stay in
school and consider post-secondary education.
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need funds to cover the costs of sports
equipment, education day activities, T-shirts, medals and refreshments provided to the
more than 3,000 high school competitors, officials and volunteers. The LA Junior Chamber
of Commerce Charity Foundation is an established 501(c)(3), nonprofit
organization. Your contribution is tax deductible as a charitable donation.

The austrian company Unique Locations is a start-up company and still in its infancy. The idea for the company was founded by Günther Brunner's passion for winter, snow, and art. Intrigued by the opportunity to combine these three things, he learned how to build igloos, became a professional igloo builder, and founded the company together with Jennifer Nessler at his side.
Therefore, the companies area of expertise is the commercial construction of igloos. We focus our work on conceptual design, planning, construction, artistic design and maintenance of snow structures as well as giving accompanying advice on the use of igloos for hotel or catering purposes.
 
Igloo constrution with intelligence & passion
 
Günther Brunner is the heart and head of the company. As the only government approved master igloo builder in Austria, Brunner has created snow igloos of incomparable quality and size over the last twelve years. His passion for building igloos has already sent him on adventurous journeys, e.g. to one of the most Northern spots in Europe, to Swedish Lapland, close to the Arctic Circle. He made his mark in history with the construction of the world’s biggest igloo for the German TV channel “PRO7” and its entry into the “Guinness Book of World Records”.
 
The Fine Art of Building Igloos
 
You must know your business: We take every contingency into consideration when building an igloo – from the preparations to taking the igloo down again, you benefit from our profound and highly specialized knowledge.Thanks to the so called „balloon“–technique which partly was developed by Brunner, snow palaces are built more effectively, faster and more stable than with the traditional “cube”-technique. Unique Locations sees a rough diamond in every single igloo. With passion for detail and the necessary experience each igloo gets its individual finishing touches and transforms into one brilliant and unique world of its own.
 
The Diversity of Igloos
 
In the past, Inuits mostly used igloos to stay safe, warm and as a space for living. Today, there is no limit on how to use the interior of an igloo:


As event location: art shows, parties, receptions, incentives, sport events, museum, casino, etc.
As exclusive hotel: igloo hotel, separate igloo suites, etc.
As catering business: igloo bar, igloo restaurant, etc.

 
What we need - HOW YOU CAN HELP!
 
Last season our company ran a project called “The Fridge” with total costs of more than 120.000 euros.  Unfortunately, the winter season was very bad and we also had bad luck with some of our so called “partners”, so we lost all the money we invested and still have a big amount of money to pay to our providers. In fact we would have to close down to company if we don’t find a solution. 
On the other side “The Fridge” was an important project and another milestone in the history of igloo construction as it was the first igloo 600 m over sea level.
 
As more and more people and countries get to know our products we already have requests for more projects this season, which makes us able to pay part of our depts.
But still 40.000 Euros are missing to save the company and the dream of constructing more individual igloo works of art. No bank institute is willing to lend us money, as we are a small company and young owners without a big financial background we don’t have the safety for the bank that they need because of the economic situation worldwide - so we need your help to save our existance…

<p>We are a team of seasoned AI and robotics experts, and we're asking for your kind participation in our quest to <strong>give our robot Adam Z1 the mental ability of a three year old child.</strong></p>
<p><em>Who needs a robot with the brain of a three year old child, you ask?  Aren’t there enough bratty 3 year olds in the world?</em></p>
<p>The point is -- <strong>a three year old has one critical thing that all current AI programs lack: COMMON SENSE.</strong></p>
<p>By using the <a href=""http://opencog.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OpenCog </a>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) architecture to create a childlike mind for our <a href=""http://hansonrobokind.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hanson Robokind</a> robot Adam Z1, we will be doing more than just making Adam the world's smartest robot.  We will be creating <strong>the first AI system with real common sense understanding.</strong></p>
<p>Currently the intelligence of robots is limited by their reliance on “narrow AI systems” – AI programs that are good at doing one particular task but lack the ability for generalized intelligence, because theyare  unable to comprehend and interpret the world around them.   </p>
<p>Once the common sense bottleneck is passed, all sorts of amazing practical AI applications will become possible – the world will be transformed.  </p>
<p>Creating a robot toddler is an amazing project unto itself, but even more amazing in terms of what it will lead to – a core AGI engine that understands the everyday human world, and can power an unlimited variety of intelligent robots and computer systems.</p>
<p>Today, in 2013, we have powerful computers, deep knowledge of cognitive and neural science, and fantastic robots like Adam Z1.  We have the knowledge it takes to make a critical breakthrough in AGI robotics.  We are at the point where we can make the long-time dreams of the AI field come to life.</p>
<p>All we need is just a little bit of research funding, to help us make it happen.</p>
<p><em><strong>And that’s where you come in.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you want to be part of research that will change the world in countless astounding ways, <em><strong>this is your chance!</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Geni Lab</strong></h2>
<p>Here at Geni Lab we’ve assembled some of the world’s top experts to break through the barrier and give Adam what we refer to as “robotic common sense”, meaning the ability to adapt, interpret, and apply knowledge to make more intelligent decisions.   By integrating the OpenCog AGI architecture with the Adam Z1 robot and teaching the robot in our lab, we believe that we can make Adam roughly as intelligent as a three year old toddler!</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em><strong>all the research we do on Adam Z1 will be open source</strong></em> and available to the public. This means that we – and others – will be able to apply this new technology to address many of the world’s vital problems.  </p>
<p>Check out our <a href=""http://geni-lab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Geni Lab website</a> for more information, including a <a href=""http://geni-lab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">7 minute video overview </a>surveying the work of Geni Lab’s key researchers.</p>
<h2><strong>The Intelligence of Robot Adam Z1</strong></h2>
<p>If we are able to fund this project, Adam Z1 will far surpass the intelligence of current robots and will acquire what we equate to “toddler level intelligence”.  This means that Adam will be able to accomplish the following tasks and many more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Play with Toys</strong>: Adam will build using blocks and play with other children’s toys</li>
<li>
<strong>Draw Pictures:</strong> Adam will interact with an IPad and use it to draw pictures that represent anything from his thoughts to how he interprets his environment</li>
<li>
<strong>Communicate with Humans:</strong> Using his OpenCog powered brain, Adam will speak with us and tell us what he is thinking, what he wants, and respond to your questions. Technically, this is referred to as “experientially grounded language understanding and generation.”</li>
<li>
<strong>Respond to Human Emotion:</strong> With David Hanson’s help, Adam will display human emotions at a level that far surpasses current robots. Taking it a step further, Adam will even be able interpret your emotions and respond accordingly. If Adam thinks you’re sad for example, he can cheer you up with a happy remark or funny joke!</li>
<li>
<strong>Schedule and Make Plans:</strong> Adam will make reasonable and rational decisions and plan a schedule accordingly. If you want to have a discussion with him about a specific topic later that day, Adam can remind you!</li>
</ul><h2><strong>The Impact of Robotic Intelligence </strong></h2>
<p>Science fiction tends to focus on the possible downsides of advanced AI, because crises and battles make exciting stories.   In reality, though, AI like the kind we’re building for Adam Z1 has the potential to enhance the lives of billions of people. Here are just some of the vital problems and impacts that intelligent AI can have on our society:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Short term (3-5 years): </strong>An AI with common sense understanding and basic general purpose thinking ability, once created, can be expected to rapidly pervade cutting-edge areas in the software and hardware industry, including scientific data analysis, adaptive control of industrial and consumer robots, video game AI, internet search, automated question answering</li>
<li>
<strong>Mid Term (5-20 years): </strong>Once the common sense bottleneck has been passed, AGI can be expected to transform essentially every industry on the planet, step by step.   Two areas that interest us especially are service robots (robots to clean the house, robot assistants to follow you everywhere and help you with the tedia of everyday life, robot tutors to help the kids, etc.), and AGI scientists (imagine a biology lab where experimental design, data analysis and lab equipment operation is all done by an integrated AGI system, networked with thousands of similar systems around the world – how much progress would be made at curing disease and prolonging life that way?)</li>
<li>
<strong>Long Term (20+ years): </strong>We are fans and friends of Ray Kurzweil and Vernor Vinge.   A toddler-like mind for Adam Z1 will be a big step beyond the current state of robotics – but the REALLY big step will be when the global network of robots, AGI programs and human beings moves on to a radically superhuman sort of general intelligence.   This may sound fanciful, but no more so than the Internet would have sounded in 1925.  But to get to the awesome Singularity scenarios that Kurzweil and Vinge talk about, we need to take first steps first.  The next step on the path involves the achievement of basic, everyday robotic common sense … such as we plan to inculcate in Adam Z1 over the next couple years.  </li>
</ul><h2><strong>The World Renowned Team </strong></h2>
<p>Hailing from across the world, the Geni Lab leadership team consists of the following experts capable of making this dream a reality:</p>

We are a team of seasoned AI and robotics experts, and we're asking for your kind participation in our quest to give our robot Adam Z1 the mental ability of a three year old child.
Who needs a robot with the brain of a three year old child, you ask?  Aren’t there enough bratty 3 year olds in the world?
The point is -- a three year old has one critical thing that all current AI programs lack: COMMON SENSE.
By using the OpenCog Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) architecture to create a childlike mind for our Hanson Robokind robot Adam Z1, we will be doing more than just making Adam the world's smartest robot.  We will be creating the first AI system with real common sense understanding.
Currently the intelligence of robots is limited by their reliance on “narrow AI systems” – AI programs that are good at doing one particular task but lack the ability for generalized intelligence, because theyare  unable to comprehend and interpret the world around them.   
Once the common sense bottleneck is passed, all sorts of amazing practical AI applications will become possible – the world will be transformed.  
Creating a robot toddler is an amazing project unto itself, but even more amazing in terms of what it will lead to – a core AGI engine that understands the everyday human world, and can power an unlimited variety of intelligent robots and computer systems.
Today, in 2013, we have powerful computers, deep knowledge of cognitive and neural science, and fantastic robots like Adam Z1.  We have the knowledge it takes to make a critical breakthrough in AGI robotics.  We are at the point where we can make the long-time dreams of the AI field come to life.
All we need is just a little bit of research funding, to help us make it happen.
And that’s where you come in.
If you want to be part of research that will change the world in countless astounding ways, this is your chance!
Geni Lab
Here at Geni Lab we’ve assembled some of the world’s top experts to break through the barrier and give Adam what we refer to as “robotic common sense”, meaning the ability to adapt, interpret, and apply knowledge to make more intelligent decisions.   By integrating the OpenCog AGI architecture with the Adam Z1 robot and teaching the robot in our lab, we believe that we can make Adam roughly as intelligent as a three year old toddler!
Furthermore, all the research we do on Adam Z1 will be open source and available to the public. This means that we – and others – will be able to apply this new technology to address many of the world’s vital problems.  
Check out our Geni Lab website for more information, including a 7 minute video overview surveying the work of Geni Lab’s key researchers.
The Intelligence of Robot Adam Z1
If we are able to fund this project, Adam Z1 will far surpass the intelligence of current robots and will acquire what we equate to “toddler level intelligence”.  This means that Adam will be able to accomplish the following tasks and many more:


Play with Toys: Adam will build using blocks and play with other children’s toys

Draw Pictures: Adam will interact with an IPad and use it to draw pictures that represent anything from his thoughts to how he interprets his environment

Communicate with Humans: Using his OpenCog powered brain, Adam will speak with us and tell us what he is thinking, what he wants, and respond to your questions. Technically, this is referred to as “experientially grounded language understanding and generation.”

Respond to Human Emotion: With David Hanson’s help, Adam will display human emotions at a level that far surpasses current robots. Taking it a step further, Adam will even be able interpret your emotions and respond accordingly. If Adam thinks you’re sad for example, he can cheer you up with a happy remark or funny joke!

Schedule and Make Plans: Adam will make reasonable and rational decisions and plan a schedule accordingly. If you want to have a discussion with him about a specific topic later that day, Adam can remind you!
The Impact of Robotic Intelligence 
Science fiction tends to focus on the possible downsides of advanced AI, because crises and battles make exciting stories.   In reality, though, AI like the kind we’re building for Adam Z1 has the potential to enhance the lives of billions of people. Here are just some of the vital problems and impacts that intelligent AI can have on our society:


Short term (3-5 years): An AI with common sense understanding and basic general purpose thinking ability, once created, can be expected to rapidly pervade cutting-edge areas in the software and hardware industry, including scientific data analysis, adaptive control of industrial and consumer robots, video game AI, internet search, automated question answering

Mid Term (5-20 years): Once the common sense bottleneck has been passed, AGI can be expected to transform essentially every industry on the planet, step by step.   Two areas that interest us especially are service robots (robots to clean the house, robot assistants to follow you everywhere and help you with the tedia of everyday life, robot tutors to help the kids, etc.), and AGI scientists (imagine a biology lab where experimental design, data analysis and lab equipment operation is all done by an integrated AGI system, networked with thousands of similar systems around the world – how much progress would be made at curing disease and prolonging life that way?)

Long Term (20+ years): We are fans and friends of Ray Kurzweil and Vernor Vinge.   A toddler-like mind for Adam Z1 will be a big step beyond the current state of robotics – but the REALLY big step will be when the global network of robots, AGI programs and human beings moves on to a radically superhuman sort of general intelligence.   This may sound fanciful, but no more so than the Internet would have sounded in 1925.  But to get to the awesome Singularity scenarios that Kurzweil and Vinge talk about, we need to take first steps first.  The next step on the path involves the achievement of basic, everyday robotic common sense … such as we plan to inculcate in Adam Z1 over the next couple years.  
The World Renowned Team 
Hailing from across the world, the Geni Lab leadership team consists of the following experts capable of making this dream a reality:
Ben Goertzel - Building the Brain. World renowned leader in Artificial General Intelligence. Leader of the OpenCog Artificial Intelligence Project and the AGI conference series, author of numerous books and research papers on AGI, founder of multiple commercial AI projects.
David Hanson – Creator of the Adam Z1 robot.  David’s company Hanson Robokind builds the Zeno line of humanoid robots, of which Adam Z1 is an early example. 
Mark Tilden – Expert on Robot movement. The inventor of BEAM robotics and creator of the WowWee RoboSapien Humanoid Robots.   He is the man to make Adam move with naturalness and broad capability.
Gino Yu – Consciousness and Human-Machine Interaction Expert.  Gino is the Principal Investigator of the current OpenCog project at Hong Kong Poly U, where he serves as a professor.   An expert in human-computer interaction, he will mastermind the social and emotional aspects of Adam Z1’s software.
Together,this ""Dream Team""'s vast experience and deep seeded motivation to enhance humanity through robotics and artificial intelligence makes us the perfect team to expand the boundaries of intelligent AI.

<h1>Prolight Boards</h1>
<p>In September 2008, Abraham Carattini, founder of PROLIGHT BOARDS, INC., was returning home late one night. While only a few blocks from his home, which is near a skating park, he pulled up to a red light to make a right turn. Thinking all was clear, he began the turn and almost hit a skater who seemed to appear out of nowhere. Abraham was shaken by the thought that the skater could have been seriously injured. He wondered how many other skaters had not been quite as fortunate. From this experience he came up with the idea of an LED lighted skateboard. Immediately, he began working on a prototype that would provide this safety feature without compromising the integrity of the board. After research revealed the breadth and scope of the skateboarding industry, Abraham realized that he had a solid, if not revolutionary, idea.</p>

<p>Hi my name is
Zachary Palmer. I am from Owings Mills, Maryland and am currently preparing for
my Bar Mitzvah.<span>  I really like working
with children and helping others.  This past
summer, I worked as a TNT (Top Notch Teen Program) at the Jewish Community
Center.  I helped out in the preschool
and then in the afternoon had a chance to socialize and play sports with the
other TNTs. Those that know me, know that I love sports and can usually be
found outside playing baseball or basketball. 
</span></p>
<p>My Mom made
her first trip to Israel with the Jewish Women’s Renaissance Program this
year.<span>  When
she returned she told me about a place called Shalva that she visited.  I learned about all the amazing children there
and knew that I wanted to help them. 
Shalva , in Hebrew, means “peace of mind”. They have helped over 500
babies, children, adolescence, and young adults with special needs.  All at no cost the family.  Shalva staff focuses on social interaction,
so that the children can integrate into the community.  What better way to be social then by playing
sports!  You can learn more about Shalva
at : <a href=""http://www.shalva.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.shalva.org</a> .</span></p>
<p>I hope to
help the children of Shalva by combining the two things I like to do, helping
children and sports. This special website has been set up to send funds to
Israel where new sports equipment can be purchased by Shalva for the
children.<span>  I really would appreciate your
assistance with this project, and hope one day to visit Israel so I can meet
the children of Shalva and see the benefits of the mitzvah.</span></p>

<h3>If only the actual bakery could be put together so quickly!</h3>
<p>p.s. That's not me in the video. You can tell because her clothes are not covered in powdered sugar.</p>
<h3>About this wacky adventure upon which you have stumbled:</h3>
<p>After seven and a half years as a public school teacher working with adolescents with behavior ""issues"", I am trading my behavior lessons for recipe cards. I have been designing and creating custom cakes as a hobby for four years; it's time to go pro. With your help, I will open a custom, small batch bakery in the Auburn/ Opelika area this summer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So...?</h3>
<p>Opening a bakery takes money, y'all! I am looking for $2000 to cover some of the costs of the build-out. I've been hitting restaurant auctions for the past year or two to get as much equipment as I can. I still need the triple sink, the big mixer. some shelving and other less interesting bakery gear. Oh, and someone to install it all when I find the perfect location! </p>
<p>If we surpass this goal, you and me, the additional funds will go to paying for more of the build out (I'm expecting the total to be up to $10,000, depending on the location), the first few months of rent, and other wacky things like insurance, license fees, and inventory. You're giving me a running start!</p>
<h3>And...?</h3>
<p>Now, what can I offer you in exchange for your support? Obviously, you get bragging rights: you'll have helped create one of the most creative cake studios in the South! You also get my undying gratitude in the form of your name proudly displayed on the wall of the bakery for at least a year (no matter the size of your contribution). Then, there are the tasty treats and experiences I have to offer. You should really check those out. They're over there in the gray boxes -&gt;</p>
<p>AND, any donation you make at the $100 level or higher will score you an invitation to our Grand Opening Reception, a super-chic soiree when the shop is ready to open. </p>
<p>*Make sure you include your e-mail address so that we can contact you and get you your perks*</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Go on...</h3>
<p>Since I started on this whole cake adventure, I have met some interesting characters. I have had the privilege of caking for some of the kindest people there are. I genuinely believe that people matter. They deserve to be appreciated and celebrated. And so, when an important occasion like a birthday, wedding, or anniversary rolls around, I think people deserve to celebrate with a cake that was made just for them:  designed, baked, and decorated with them in mind.</p>
<p>Cakeapotamus will offer custom cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and other treats, including those little pink things everyone seems to love.. We will also offer tea parties for kids and their dolls or bears and evening cake decorating classes for adults. I'm even working on getting the permits required so you can bring your own wine and REALLY enjoy decorating your cake. It's going to be a great place, y'all. I can't wait for you to see it!</p>
</div>

</div></div>","If only the actual bakery could be put together so quickly!
p.s. That's not me in the video. You can tell because her clothes are not covered in powdered sugar.
About this wacky adventure upon which you have stumbled:
After seven and a half years as a public school teacher working with adolescents with behavior ""issues"", I am trading my behavior lessons for recipe cards. I have been designing and creating custom cakes as a hobby for four years; it's time to go pro. With your help, I will open a custom, small batch bakery in the Auburn/ Opelika area this summer.


So...?
Opening a bakery takes money, y'all! I am looking for $2000 to cover some of the costs of the build-out. I've been hitting restaurant auctions for the past year or two to get as much equipment as I can. I still need the triple sink, the big mixer. some shelving and other less interesting bakery gear. Oh, and someone to install it all when I find the perfect location! 
If we surpass this goal, you and me, the additional funds will go to paying for more of the build out (I'm expecting the total to be up to $10,000, depending on the location), the first few months of rent, and other wacky things like insurance, license fees, and inventory. You're giving me a running start!
And...?
Now, what can I offer you in exchange for your support? Obviously, you get bragging rights: you'll have helped create one of the most creative cake studios in the South! You also get my undying gratitude in the form of your name proudly displayed on the wall of the bakery for at least a year (no matter the size of your contribution). Then, there are the tasty treats and experiences I have to offer. You should really check those out. They're over there in the gray boxes ->
AND, any donation you make at the $100 level or higher will score you an invitation to our Grand Opening Reception, a super-chic soiree when the shop is ready to open. 
*Make sure you include your e-mail address so that we can contact you and get you your perks*


Go on...
Since I started on this whole cake adventure, I have met some interesting characters. I have had the privilege of caking for some of the kindest people there are. I genuinely believe that people matter. They deserve to be appreciated and celebrated. And so, when an important occasion like a birthday, wedding, or anniversary rolls around, I think people deserve to celebrate with a cake that was made just for them:  designed, baked, and decorated with them in mind.
Cakeapotamus will offer custom cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and other treats, including those little pink things everyone seems to love.. We will also offer tea parties for kids and their dolls or bears and evening cake decorating classes for adults. I'm even working on getting the permits required so you can bring your own wine and REALLY enjoy decorating your cake. It's going to be a great place, y'all. I can't wait for you to see it!


Anything else?
I'll take all the help I can get making this adventure happen. Help me spread the word, you guys! Tell your friends about this fundraising project (especially your rich friends who like cake). Tell everybody you know about the awesome new bakery that's opening this summer. But most importantly, please come visit the shop when it opens. I'll see you there!

<h3>LET'S KEEP GOING</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>On behalf of everyone at Columbia Heights Community Marketplace, we want to thank all of the donors and market customers who helped us reach our goal for the Farmers Market Thanksgiving <b>less than two weeks</b> into our campaign! Because of your overwhelming – and humbling – generosity, we have already met our $2,500 goal. Your support is the only thing that allows us to continue working to build an inclusive, vibrant marketplace for the community, so thank you once again.</p>
<p>Our original goal was to provide $50 dollars to 50 low-income neighborhood families, for them to spend at the market in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving. As always, the demand exceeded our expected supply of nutritional assistance funds. Many more than 50 families – all of whom rely on nutritional assistance programs to help them shop at the market – signed up for the program. <b>With your continued support, we have the chance to make an even bigger impact this Thanksgiving</b>.</p>
<p><strong>Help us double our goal</strong> – and help twice as many neighborhood families – <strong>by raising $5,000</strong> before the campaign closes on November 15.  And if you’ve already donated, please reach out to friends and family and let them know how much you enjoy the farmers market, and how important it is to ensure everyone in the community has a place to shop this Thanksgiving.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>FARMERS MARKET THANKSGIVING</h3>Food changes lives. Walk down any street and see how bad food ruins people's lives. Good food makes people's lives better. But good food can be expensive and challenging to cook. <p>The most important food day is Thanksgiving. Think about how much the average family spends on a Thanksgiving spread and how much joy it generates. Thanksgiving is all about sharing. You stuff the face of everyone around you and then have plenty of leftovers to share for days afterwards.</p>
<p>This year we gave out close to $10,000 in matching funds to families in need shopping at the market on nutritional assitance programs. We want to raise an additional $2,500 to give 50 of those families money to spend for their Thanksgiving dinner. They can buy anything they want from any vendor at the Columbia Heights Community Marketplace Farmers Market. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This is a win-win. Families in need get fresh, wholesome food right at Thanksgiving, and the money goes to support local farmers and food producers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We want folks to think of food as a cause and think of the Columbia Heights Community Marketplace as a solution to food access. Most people think of us as just a farmers market but we're more than that. We help feed families and support local farmers and food businesses.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>By raising this modest amount of money, we want to show how food can make a difference in people's lives and establish the Marketplace as an organization with a mission of changing lives through fresh, healthy local food.</p>Give the gift of good food today and help make a difference.<p></p>

consumers power to choose the products they want and by returning the

<p>ieCost is designed for People and Families who want to pay

<p>Using purchasing power to reestablish fair prices, the
Mission of ieCost is to facilitate economic betterment and wellness for all

<p>At ieCost, we earn revenue by mass-market Brand advertising

<p><br/></p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h3>THE WHY </h3>
<p>Directed by Social Responsibility, ieCost believes middle and
lower class working people need an economic break. As consumers they need to be
able to purchase everyday necessities at reasonable prices.</p>
<span><span><span><span>
<p>Middle and lower class working consumers deserve a
much-needed economic break. 
Hard-working People and Families must be able to afford more – to get much
more for their money.</p>
<p>Yet there is an increasingly disproportionate distribution
of wealth between today’s stockholders and today’s working consumers.</p>
<p>At ieCost we recognize the consumer has a direct impact on any
company's success; the consumer is investing his/her money when purchasing a
product. </p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the consumer should reap a
financial reward in accordance with the success of the companies they chose to
support, just like a stockholder.</p>
<p>We at ieCost are committed to that principle with our hearts,
minds, spirits, and with our profits.</p></span></span></span></span><h3><br/></h3>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">THANK YOU!</span> It is with great appreciation that ieCost receives
your funding contributions. The reward ieCost gives you is VIP Value:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">VIP Specific-Value <br/>
VIP Unit-Value <br/>
VIP Honor-Value <br/>
VIP Honor-Value Member <br/>
VIP Business-Value <br/>
VIP Exclusive Business Client</p>
<p>Our motto is “Give YOU what YOU want.” We recognize everyone
has different likes and dislikes. We ultimately let you choose the products
&amp; services you want. Redeem your VIP Values…. over time there will be hundreds of
products &amp; services to choose from. </p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>VIP VALUES AND HOW TO REDEEM<br/>
</h3></span><p></p>
<p>It is simple. The Perks*: top
products &amp; services will be donated to ieCost to be given to fund contributors
in exchange for the VIP Values. </p>
<p>ieCost will email the fund
contributor a confirmation and a VIP Value Certificate, within 15 days after full funding confirmation by Indiegogo. The Certificate--the VIP Values will redeem
or be exchanged for products &amp; services. As additional products &amp;
services become available, VIP Value selections can be made and final selections are
confirmed.</p>
<p>Each item in the Perks section
indicates how many and what type VIP-Values are to be given in accordance to
the amount of contribution. Also, specific items will indicate how many VIP Values are required to redeem. It is important to note, VIP Values can
redeem other items, including future products &amp; services.</p>
<p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">*Perks: the items or the choices are too many to list. However within each Perk area, ieCost has variety of choices and at the time of final selections all the possible choices will be available. </i></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Example<i>: The Body Care products come in many possible fragrances and
ingredients. So, simply enter the contribution amount corresponding to a
Collection. After you receive a VIP Value Certificate and products become
available on the ieCost web site, you will be able to confirm final selection.</i></i></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3>THE ieCost PROFESSIONALS</h3>
</span></span></span></span></span>It is important to note that many professionals and vendor
companies are ready to carry ieCost forward to great success. Many have

fully funded.<p></p>
<p>However, ieCost will also be employing and utilizing the

“If you work hard and serve from the heart people will come back.” <br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Second,</span> “Make available
products people want and they will buy.” <br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Third,</span> “Do the first &amp; second and

A For-Profit, Socially Responsible, Social Network
Advertising and Marketing Company. 

ieCost is a for-profit, socially responsible, social network
advertising and marketing company that maximizes consumer savings by leveraging
consumers power to choose the products they want and by returning the
company’s profits to consumers in the form of savings on their purchases.
ieCost is designed for People and Families who want to pay
less on their EVERYDAY purchases. 
Using purchasing power to reestablish fair prices, the
Mission of ieCost is to facilitate economic betterment and wellness for all
people.
At ieCost, we earn revenue by mass-market Brand advertising
and marketing strategies; developing relationships among the ieCost consumers
and exclusive Businesses so that both benefit economically. 
ieCost then transfers its profits into financial
benefit–rewards for ieCost consumers.

THE WHY 
Directed by Social Responsibility, ieCost believes middle and
lower class working people need an economic break. As consumers they need to be
able to purchase everyday necessities at reasonable prices.

Middle and lower class working consumers deserve a
much-needed economic break. 
Hard-working People and Families must be able to afford more – to get much
more for their money.
Yet there is an increasingly disproportionate distribution
of wealth between today’s stockholders and today’s working consumers.
At ieCost we recognize the consumer has a direct impact on any
company's success; the consumer is investing his/her money when purchasing a
product. 
Therefore, we believe that the consumer should reap a
financial reward in accordance with the success of the companies they chose to
support, just like a stockholder.
We at ieCost are committed to that principle with our hearts,
minds, spirits, and with our profits.
THE
HOW
It is simple: Only with your help! Only You, consumers, can
help create a company for consumers. Voice your choice by . . . 
Giving at least one dollar . . . 
Telling at least one person about ieCost . . . 
Join millions of consumers finally able to have the opportunity
to benefit from their own purchases.
Let’s Create: a philanthropic company.

indicates how many and what type VIP-Values are to be given in accordance to
the amount of contribution. Also, specific items will indicate how many VIP Values are required to redeem. It is important to note, VIP Values can
redeem other items, including future products & services.
*Perks: the items or the choices are too many to list. However within each Perk area, ieCost has variety of choices and at the time of final selections all the possible choices will be available.

ingredients. So, simply enter the contribution amount corresponding to a
Collection. After you receive a VIP Value Certificate and products become

Now, as for me, Martin V. Martos, I grew up with four family
businesses that served the community for forty years. As a result, I have been in business my whole
life. 
I learned three things from my parents about business: First,
“If you work hard and serve from the heart people will come back.” Second, “Make available
products people want and they will buy.” Third, “Do the first & second and
the business will be successful.”
Also, I have been a professional in branding, advertising
& marketing for 29 years. As a creative director, company manager, and
advertising & marketing business owner my experience is extensive, from the
largest American companies to start-ups businesses. Here is a very short list of companies
I have helped: 
Bank of America – Circle K – The Arizona Office of Tourism –
Westin La Paloma – First Federal of Arizona Bank – MeraBank – The Arizona Bank
– Western Savings Bank – Swensen’s Ice Cream – Red Mountain Ranch Community –
Realty Executives – Gore-tex Medical Products – Partners Health – Samaritan
Health – Arizona Healthcare – Birman Managed Care – Care3 – Health Unified –
Memorial Hospital Health System – InterTel – CAM Technology-SolidWorks – Intel –
AT&T– American Express.

change the savings value. 
This includes the products and

in establishing the ieCost corporation, and in final negotiations with the
different companies… the savings value may vary. However it is ieCost goal to
work to provide best prices on the market.
ieCost is a start-up company. With
full funding, stage 1 & 2 required, ieCost will be able to work toward
creating and providing the objectives of this socially responsible
philanthropic company. Thank You! ieCost & Martin V. Martos",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>I would have chosen NO goal is the option existed. Any amount collected from .50$USD to 1,000,000.00$USD(joking :P) will 100% be put towards purchasing items for those in need.

<p>In April of 2005, my husband took me to an old beat up firehouse and asked me to look past the boxes of junk, the layers of dirt and cobwebs, the three broken down cars parked in the engine bay and imagine a restaurant instead.  At first I thought he was crazy, but then I got it. We spent the next 6 months researching and writing a business plan and another 12 months trying to convince anyone else we were on to something. After countless hours of renovating, rebuilding, cleaning, painting, staining, stressing, and too many setbacks to remember, we opened our doors in December 2006.</p>
<p>When we first planned the business, I thought we'd open a nice little restaurant, make a decent living and be good to go. I had no idea of what an impact it would have on our lives, on our employees (past and present) and our community. I also had no idea that we were about to go into a recession and that we couldn't have picked a worse time for this (buying and renovating the building in the height of the real estate market when everything cost the most, followed by opening at the start of one of the worst economies ever when people started to reel in their personal spending).<br/></p>
<p>I need your help now to keep the doors open.  This is important to me on many levels. <br/></p>
<p>While I have three children of my own, it's like I've adopted 25-35 more on any given day through my employees. I care about and worry about these people as if they were my own kids. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>We have one ""kid"" who started with us the very first day as a 14 year old dishwasher and is now a 21 year old kitchen manager. <br/>
</li>
<li>We have cooks who have been with us for 5-6-7 years, which is rare in this business. <br/>
</li>
<li>There have probably been 40 other ""kids"" who have gotten their first real job with us - in a small town with no public transportation, that is saying a lot. It has allowed them to go on to other places and have something real to include on a job application.</li>
<li>We have enabled stay-at-home moms to help support their families with a part-time job, helped many keep their cars or houses when they thought they couldn't make the payments.</li>
<li>We've helped more than one employee deal with addiction and mental health issues by tracking down the help they need while allowing them to keep their jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thought of closing and leaving all of my employees unemployed keeps me up at night.</p>
<p>The impact on the community has been larger than we ever imagined as well. There is something that makes you all warm and fuzzy when you see people greeting others in a genuinely happy and friendly way and this happens all the time here.  We also have one confirmed marriage in a relationship that started when they met for the first time at our restaurant, came in often on dates, and then actually got engaged in the restaurant! We've raised thousands of dollars for schools, a young local girl who was hit by a car and seriously injured, a local organization that brings terminally ill children and their families to the beach, a police officer killed in the line of duty. We've witnessed first dates, breakups, more than one marriage proposal, weddings, baby showers, girls nights, a large group of retired firefighters meeting every month for lunch. I realize we aren't curing cancer or solving world peace, but I do feel like it matters that we are here.</p>
<p>The most important reason I have to get funding and keep the doors open are my kids.  They were almost 7, almost 4 and 18 months old when we opened and are now almost 14, almost 11 and 8. They have sacrificed more than anyone while we have worked and stressed and worked and stressed. They have been resilient and patient and healthy and challenging and I know how lucky I am to have them. I don't want their sacrifice to be for nothing.</p>
<p>I have had real struggles lately about how I am not doing enough to make the world a better place and I feel like I am constantly reminded about others who are making a profound difference. But in my own little part of the world, and in the worlds of my employees and family, I'd like to think that what I am doing is making things better and so it is that important to me to continue.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<b><h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3></b><b></b><p>I am hoping to raise $10,000. To some people this is a small amount of money (I just don't know any of those people!). To me, this is a huge amount of money.  <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>It will be used to get people in to the restaurant - sprucing up the landscaping, getting a new stand up ashtray for outside, a new state flag and restaurant flag (I've already replaced the American flag), getting our website current and running, getting a direct mail campaign out, buying tshirts and other merchandise to sell for the holidays, paying off some past due bills. There are all these little things that make a huge difference in how people perceive the restaurant, but I just don't have the cash.</li>
<li>In return, depending on your donation, you will get: a souvenir patch or pin, a beer coozie, a free BBQ Pork sandwich (if you are local!), the opportunity to spend the night with me (in the kitchen!) or a few days with me (in the restaurant!)</li>
<li>Any and all funds will be used towards operating costs of the restaurant no matter how much we raise.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>My plan is this:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>If we are able to raise funds and stay in business, then in one year from our campaign's end, I will return to indiegogo and as I am able, I will fund projects in amounts equal to whatever we raise.  That is, if you help save us, I will do what I can to help someone else.<br/>

Blessed Coffee is founded on the philosophy of ""from the farmer to your cup."" 

Established as a socially responsible business and trade geared towards development in coffee growing regions, as well as in communities in the US where coffee is sold. Now Blessed Coffee seeks to build a cafe in Takoma Park, MD. 

Blessed Coffee is:



The first business ever to implement the Virtuous Exchange (www.brewingchange.us/virtuous-exchange/) model.


The Nation’s second Benefit Corporation, a new law introduced by Maryland in 2010 to support social entrepreneurs advancing public benefit as well as profit. Now enacted in 20 States.


Designed to advance social/cultural and economic development in coffee growing regions as well as communities in the US.



It offers investment partnership and dynamic profit sharing to 240,000 small coffee growers in Ethiopia (making them major stakeholders) representing over a million families. It will give back 50% of the profit from the wholesale business to the farmers.
Providing similar investment opportunity to the community in the US and donating 50% of the profit from the café to local organizations producing public good in the US.



Since the inauguration of Blessed Coffee in 2011, Tebabu and Sara (husband/wife team and founders) have shared their story about and aspirations for developing Blessed Coffee, one cup and one conversation at a time at their dinner table, farmers markets, community events, colleges campuses, sustainable business forums and festivals. In just two years, they have come a long way.
Today, they enjoy massive community support, valuable recognition from policy makers, and broad media coverage. Their story is reaching many across the nation and beyond.



September 2011 - MD Governor Martin O’Malley, during his Blessed Coffee inauguration address, says of the business that it, “stands at the intersection of profits and social responsibility.”


January 2012 - The White House awards Blessed Coffee with the “Champion of Change” recognition.


The award honors ordinary Americans who are doing extraordinary things in their communities to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.


June 2012 - Edible DC, a Washington DC based food magazine, features a cover story recognizing Blessed Coffee as one of the 16 “Game Changers” in the local sustainable food sector.


September 2012 - At the Second Blessed Coffee Anniversary, MD Senator Jamie Raskin, the Keynote Speaker, named Blessed Coffee “Community in a Cup”

Located in Laxminagar, Delhi, it is first of its kind rehabilitation centre in the country. Chhanv is a ray of hope for all the acid attack fighters who have been struggling with their fate all alone, as the centre not only provides shelter to them during their medical treatment, but also helps them take charge of their lives after such a ghastly incident. The centre is managed and run by acid attack fighters who have recovered with their true grit and thus, is a source of inspiration and motivation for many others, who are often deserted by the hypocritical society; in some cases even by their own families. We may not be able to recover their faces, but we can heal their hearts. Please donate generously and help us to help victims of such barbaric attacks. Thank you we really appreciate your support.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Celebrate the life of<br/>Harold Larson And support the Harold Larson Williamston Food Bank</p>
<p>About The Williamston<br/>Food Bank</p>
<p>The Harold Larson Williamston<br/>Food Bank is a non-profit organization that provides emergency food to<br/>individuals and families in need in Williamston, MI school district. Food is<br/>distributed through an extensive network of partners and volunteers in the<br/>Williamston area. The Williamston Food Bank annually serves thousands of<br/>people, many of them seniors and children. Recipients also include those<br/>families and individuals who are employed but don’t earn enough to meet<br/>housing, health, transportation and food needs.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>The Harold Larson Williamston Food Bank was officially started by Harold and Margaret Larson in 1970, however, the couple had been helping Williamston residents in need long before that. As Harold told it, he and Margaret received help from their neighbors back in the late 1940's when he was struck down with polio and was unable to work for a year. During those ""lean"" times, the Larson’s realized how important it was to help out friends and neighbors who had fallen on hard<br/>times. The kindness they received inspired them to give back to others, and for<br/>nearly 50 years, this amazing couple helped countless needy families throughout<br/>our community. Today, the food bank serves families, large and small, single parents, the elderly, the unemployed and underemployed, providing food and personal items to those in the Williamston community who need help. In the last five years, the Williamston Food Bank has grown from serving 25-30 families each month to over 100.</p>
<p>Harold R. Larson was born January 29, 1924 to Raymond and Astrid (Swartstrom) Larson, and passed away May 29, 2014 at age 90. Harold served in the US Army Signal Core in WW11, and was stationed in England where he met his wife Margaret (Duckham) Larson, and they recently celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary. He enjoyed being a mail courier for the U.S. Postal Service for 30 years, was a longtime winning coach for girls' softball, and was a Williamston School Board Member. Harold was the founder of the Williamston Christmas Clearing Bureau, which gave families toys and Christmas dinner. This led to the founding of the Williamston Food Bank to distribute food to the community all year round. He found it very rewarding to handle and store hospital equipment to loan to at-need families through the American Legion. Harold was the very first person to be awarded the ""Williamston Citizen of The Year"" through Kiwanis.</p>
<p><br/><br/> On September 20, 2014 there will be an event to celebrate the life and community service of Harold Larson at the American Legion Band Shell located at McCormick Park in Williamston, Michigan.

</h2><div>

We are a team of three high school juniors working with police forces in the Greater Boston area to help return stolen bikes back to their owners.  Biking riding is on the rise in the Boston area and across the US, as many commuters have realized that the low cost and athletic nature of biking is preferable to owning and maintaining a car. Unfortunately, the increase in bike ridership has coincided with an increase in theft. Omnibike helps to get stolen bikes back by bridging the gap between the bicycles recovered by police and their owners. <br/><br/><b>""Each year, somewhere between 800,000 
and two million bicycles—worth some $50 million—are stolen... 48% 
of stolen bikes are recovered by law enforcement, only 5% of stolen 
bikes are returned to their owners."" </b><br/><p> </p>
<p>In October of 2013, we entered into a business plan competition, with our main idea being the return of stolen bikes through a serial number database. After this, we decided to bring our idea to life. We partnered with local and University police forces from places like Cambridge, Brookline, Belmont, Harvard, and MIT, and enlisted them to help return stolen bikes using our system.<br/></p>
<p>The contributions from this campaign will allow us to register as a LLC, pay a web designer to create a high quality website accessible by the police and the public and bring the business to life. <br/></p>
<br/><h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Our bike recovery system revolves around the use of serial codes 
found on the underside of every bike. Across the nation, many 
bikes are stolen, and subsequently recovered by police forces. These 
bikes cannot be linked to an owner, leaving police stations with rooms 
of stolen, unclaimed bikes. Using our system, a member of the police 
would catalog a bike's serial number when it was recovered, and if this 
number matched one already registered in the online code bank, the owner
 would be notified that their stolen bike was recovered. 
</p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h2>Funding <br/>
</h2>
<p>Our funding goal is $5000. This money will mainly be put towards the creation of our website. We will be using anywhere from $2,000-$4,000 of our funds to pay a website developer to create our website and database for identification codes. Another portion of the money will go towards registering as a LLC, legitimizing our business. Any remaining money will be put towards future website modifications and marketing material. <br/></p>
</div> <div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Bike theft is an growing issue in many towns and cities, causing huge property loss, and little after theft recovery. We hope to expand as quickly as we can to bring our service to as many people as possible. The more people who are part of our database, the more access the police have to stolen bikes, and the more useful our system becomes. By creating and expanding Omnibike, we are addressing the problem of bike theft in our community and the surrounding area, and returning stolen goods back to their rightful owners.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>One of the major difficulties we may face is if a major police force does not partner with us and creates a hole in our coverage. We will manage this risk by leveraging our existing relationship with the Cambridge Police with whom we have already established a strong relationship.  Another issue is the age of the co-founders. Because all three co-founders are minors, some business matters go slowly, or need to be done through a surrogate, which can cause greater complication.

<h3>What is Mapability</h3>
<p>Mapability is a crowd-sourced social initiative creating overlays to online maps that provide accessibility data for cities.</p>
<p>Mapability maps helps end users find the most accessible paths for <strong>wheelchair access, mothers with strollers, elderly, kid-safe areas, baby-care facilities</strong>, and much more.</p>
<p>The crowd-sourced data-acquisition comes from the members of multiple active volunteer communities and other individuals who contribute by uploading geo-localized photos and accessibility parameters using a simple online UI app.</p>
<p>Development unitl now has been done on a volunteer level, and more than 15 cities already have volunteers collecting data. We now need to finish up development and especially develop the mobile application.</p>
<h2>What do we need all that money for?</h2>
<p>We need the money the develop an awesome, cross platform mobile application that will help users find and mark accessible places and streets on the map. The application and maps will be available WORLDWIDE, in every city! We cannot do it by ourselves!</p>
<p>We are a not for profit association and our maps will always be free. </p>
<p><strong>The map</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Map shows accessibility based on street colors: the colors derive from more than 90 parameters being computed, such as:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- surface type</strong></p>
<p><strong>- street quality</strong></p>
<p><strong>- slope</strong></p>
<p><strong>- presence of barriers / obstacles</strong></p>
<p><strong>- width (for wheelchair users)</strong></p>
<p><strong>- many more!</strong></p>

<p><strong><br/></strong><strong>Mapability integrates the first augmented reality application for accessibility in the world using the Layar Browser.</strong> Every data collected can be inserted into Layar Browser for augmented reality navigation. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need to develop the mobile app to insert data. Right now you can insert data only from the desktop application, we want a native mobile app that allows users to insert data immediately. This is not easy because the application needs to:</p>
<p>- allow for photo re-positioning through a map</p>
<p>- associate more than 90 parameters to a photo</p>
<p>- send photo to database</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p><strong>SUPPORT YOUR OWN STREET PERKS</strong></p>
<p>You can become the supported of your own street! Your name or website will appear on the street information in the map!</p>
<p>You can purchase this for only $ 30 (or $ 200 for full package). Hurry up! Your street deserves your support!</p>
<p>Moreover, what you get is the chance to take part in the biggest accessibility initiative in the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can become part of our association, you will receive our memebership card and you will be able to vote on further development of the initiative. </li>
<li>You can support mapping for your own street. If you donate $ 50,00 you will have your name among the donors of the street you select. Also you will receive our T-shirt!</li>
<li>You can help us create a useful service and allow users to use it for free. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have developed a method for mapping street accessibility based on precise parameters. No one else is doing this for streets. Our methodology relies on more than 90 parameters that altogether determine accessibility for various users: wheelchair users, but also mothers with strollers, elderly, children and also blind users via speech synthesis. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Consbruck.  My business partner and I are opening up V wine tasting room.  We have rented the original library in West Hollywood, California and plan to transform the now delapidated space back into a glorious 1930's library - a throw back to its heritage.  The space is currently listed on the historic registery, but it needs work! </p>
<p>I am a landscape architect by day with a passion for boutique wines, and sharing my experience and knowledge of wine.  I learn more every day, and love to explore good wines with friends, family and new guests.  The boutique wines represented at V are all made by small winemakers that do not have other representation.  By helping us fulfill our dreams of a wine tasting and education room, we help the winemakers fulfill their dreams of making and selling great wines.</p>
<p>We are in construction, but ran into significant structural issues that had to be corrected for the safety of our guests and the integrity of the building.  We have experienced a construction budget grow by 200% and we need help to finish construction and bring in our inventory.  This process has taken almost an entire year of permits, hearings, more permits and numerous hurdles thrown at us by the city.  We have successuflly won everyone over, designed an amazing space but have been paying rent this entire time and have come to the end of our initial funding.  We need your help to finish our project and finally open our doors to friends, the community, guests and all the new friends we will make along the way!</p>
<p><br/>All of the contributions will go directly to construction expenses and to purchase furniture and inventory.  We have a goal to be open by mid January and with all of your help we will be able to achieve this goal.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for $15,000, all of which will be used directly for construction and inventory.  We have paid for and corrected all of the structural issues plaguing the building inflicted by previous tenants and years of neglect, and are now ready to do all the cosmetic changes transforming the space from an open room to a 1930's library with custom built book cases, a tasting bar that looks like a check out desk, detail, trim and images evoking a warm and inviting feel.  </p>
<p>People will use a renovated card catalog to find the location of different wines, books on wine and different gifts and merchandise located through out the book shelves and tables in the space.  Each guest will have a library card, which will allow us to personalize their experience and cator to their specific tastes.  </p>
<p>Our goal is $15,000, but any little bit helps!  We will be greatful for any contribution given to our dream, with any additional money raised above $15,000 to be used for the first months operating expenses and rent.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our project is unique as it will be the only tasting room in West Hollywood.  Additionally it will be the first tasting room in southern California that provides the guests with wine education and information on all the winemakers we represent.  We will provide a unique space for neighbors and guests to experience unique wines that cannot be found at any other retail venue in all of Southern California.  </p>
<p>All contributions not only help us open and realize our dream, but it also helps small the small winemakers we represent.  None of these boutique winemakers use a national or regional brokerage to sell their product, relying on sales our of their own tasting rooms, local sales in their home town and region and the success of V.  We are proud to be a small business helping and promoting other small businesses.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any contribution you can make will have a big impact on our project and dream, not to mention the dream of many other boutique winemakers.  If you are not able to make a contribution, spreading the word is just as good to other people who might want to contribute.  Any amout of help or word of mouth is very appreciated! </p>

<span>HOW IT WORKS</span>
</h4><h4>
<span></span>
</h4>
<p>Socialgiver is a <b>‘giving ecosystem’</b> where each partner gives something and gets something more valuable in return. We create a win-win-win solution:</p><div>
<b>For Consumers, Socialgiver offers a ""Lifestyle with a Social Twist""</b><br/>We
 bring you hand-picked products and services from leading brands at 
exclusive rates; such as hotels, restaurants and activities. Not only 
does Socialgiver give you the best rates, but every dollar you spend is 
put toward creating impact and sustainability for causes you care about 
most.<br/><br/><b>For Social Projects, Socialgiver gives ""Access to Sustainable Funding""</b><br/>Socialgiver commits 70% of the revenue generated through online sales to
 social projects. 30% helps pay our costs and attract more businesses. On top of just fundraising, we connect them with donors and fans, and assist them to 
achieve their social impact goals - helping them become more effective in using funds.<br/><br/><b><b>For Hospitality Businesses, Socialgiver helps ""Create Shared Value""</b></b><br/>We help businesses integrate the customer experience with the giving experience. By tapping into ‘spare service capacity’ of businesses (unfilled rooms, unserved seats, unsold tickets) that currently generate no value, Socialgiver helps businesses give back in a meaningful way while attracting new customers who will fall in love with their brand. We connect them with YOU, the customer, so you can give back together...<br/><div>

<p><b>We currently support 12 projects </b>in Thailand with a sustainable source of funding, so far raising
over $30,000 in our test stage. Here are 3 examples of the social impacts
of the funding through Socialgiver:</p>
<p><i><b>Love
Wildlife Foundation</b></i> is a wildlife conservation project, specialising in the
protection and rehabilitation of the endangered slow lorises from illegal
trafficking and habitat encroachment. Funding is ensuring a constant
supply of medicines, important due to tooth infections from the clipping
of the teeth by traffickers, and the employment of a part-time vet
who comes to the center once a week.</p>
<p><i><b>The Swimsafe Sharks</b></i> is a swimming and water survival
education project in rural Thai schools. The child drowning rates in Thailand
are alarming as there are little or no facilities to teach swimming in rural areas. Funding is helping to train 15 swimming and survival swimming
instructors with the help of The Thai Life Saving Society and to purchase flotation devices. The
funding is supporting work with 3 schools teaching 776 children.</p>
<p><i><b>Zy Movement
Foundation</b></i> supports children with disabilities, and empowers their families
with knowledge, skill, and the mental willpower to raise their children to the
highest potential. We support their Vojta therapy programme, which stimulates
and rehabilitates the deep muscle systems of the spine and extremities, making
a difference for these children throughout their entire life. The programme is
currently training 24 therapists, who are expected to treat up to one thousand
children each year.</p>
